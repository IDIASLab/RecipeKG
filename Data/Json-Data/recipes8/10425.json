The croissants bake up into a crisp, flaky, buttery crust with a baklava-like texture. Perfect for your Thanksgiving dessert table! Serve topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or just pick them up and eat them like muffins.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was incredibly easy and turned out great. It reminded me of a mix between a kouign amann and a pecan pie. I did as he suggested and whisked the eggs directly into the hot sugar mixture (which I even let cool for 3 minutes first). I noticed some very small pieces of scrambled egg appearing, but I decided to follow through. In the final product the bits of egg were not noticeable at all. I halved the recipe (like in the video) and ended up with quite a bit of leftover filling, which I may bake on top of some brownies. I\u2019m a big fan of chocolate pecan pie so I did half of mine with chocolate chips and they were a really yummy addition. Topped with a bot of lightly sweetened bourbon whipped cream and we were impressed. We will be whipping up a batch for thanksgiving I think.",

I used dark corn syrup instead of light, but I don't know how much of a difference that would have made to the final product. Used croissants from my grocery store's bakery section. Nothing fancy, but it didn't matter in the end because it turned out fantastic anyway. Ended up with a bit more filling than cups, but that could just be due to the size of my cupcake pan. 10/10: Will be making again.",
