I'd serve this immediately unless you want to keep adding ranch dressing--I made it a few hours ahead of time and when we were ready to eat it was pretty dry so I added more ranch dressing. It is a bit bland--bf and I were adding salt and pepper at the table. He does that a lot but I generally dont so I'd add salt and pepper prior to serving next time. Chives or green onions might be nice in this too. thanks for the recipe!",
