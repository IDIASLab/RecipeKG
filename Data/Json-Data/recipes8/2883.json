I had a slight chili powder oops so I added another can of cream of chicken soup, a bit more broth and extra chicken to compensate.  Note to self - be careful with the chili powder.  We're not big salt eaters so this was a little bit salty for us.  Next time I make it I will be sure I use low sodium soups and chicken broth.  Because I hate to debone, I also used the rotisserie chicken breast that's already been deboned from warehouse big box store.  I find this to be a good recipe as is and also a good base for any personal preference you would like to incorporate.",
