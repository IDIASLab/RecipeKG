To give it more fruit flavor, I added the lime zest from two limes to the water before I boiled it.  Once the simple syrup was made, I added the lime juice from both limes.  Once it cooled a bit, I put in in the fridge for a while.  I ended up with more than a cup of simple syrup, so I just used a cup of it and am saving the rest to make the recipe again.  Very yummy!

                "reviewBody": "I saw a comment on here about how to make ice cream without the ice cream maker and since I have the exact same problem, I found this on the internet:\n\nMake sure you have a bowl that\u2019s quite wide to use for the churning/freezing process that comes next. \n\nTake your ice cream recipe mixture and carefully pour it into the bowl, then chill in the fridge for up to 2 hours, checking on it after 1 hour. The reason it can take longer than an hour is when a recipe mixture has had cooked ingredients added, therefore thorough chilling will take longer. \n\nTake the bowl out of the fridge and transfer to the freezer for about half an hour. Then check just how much the mixture has frozen - ideally, it should have started to freeze at the edges but not fully through to the centre. \n\nTake the bowl out of the freezer and  beat the ice cream mixture until it\u2019s creamy once again (to dislodge and break up the ice crystals that have formed).\n\nPut it back in the freezer for another half hour, then remove and once again beat with a whisk.\n\nDo this again so that you have beaten the mixture a total of 3 times whilst freezing in between.\n\nPut the mixture back into the freezer for a final time until it\u2019s ready to eat. This can take anything from 30 minutes upwards, depending upon the quantity and type of ice cream you\u2019re making and also how you like the consistency of your ice cream (some people like it softer, some harder).\n",

Thanks to the extreme ripeness, there was no need for peeling much - just cut it in half and pull out the \"meat.\" I combined all of the ingredients in a blender for easier pouring. I have a 4-qt. ice cream maker, and this recipe filled less than one-fourth of its container. So, it actually required less time then the machine alotted for, so check yours every once and a while. Once the sorbet was done, it was almost like a \"soft serve\" consistency; which we all liked a lot, but if you like your pretty frozen and a bit harder, I suggest letting it freeze in the freezer for quite a while. Finally, I believe this recipe says that it can serve 12, well it definitely cannot. I only ended up with 4 servings, which is perfect for the 4 of us, but if you want more you will need to increase the ingredients. (I guess it is one mango per person :D ). Oh, and one more thing, I used bottled lime juice, not fresh and it was fine. Very tasty, you should definitely give it a shot.",

Delightful and easily identifiable mango flavor simply enhanced with the lime juice - wouldn't have known it was in there had I not made this myself. And because I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen mango chunks (and a half recipe) this was unbelievably fast! I pureed the frozen mango then added the lime juice and syrup which I had chilled in the freezer and continued to puree until smooth. Because the mixture was pretty much frozen (and spoonable!) before it even hit the ice cream maker I don't think I even churned it ten minutes before it was done and nearly ready to eat. As for the lime juice and simple syrup I used the amounts called for in the recipe scaled down to half the recipe and found both to be perfect. Definitely a \"make again\" recipe!",

I am cutting back on sugar so I made the simple sugar syrup with 3/4 Cup instead of 1 Cup and 1 Cup water.  I used frozen Mango chunks because the store here was out of fresh.  I thawed them and they pureed perfectly.  I have a new favorite!!!  This is so light and delicious.  The lime really adds the perfect little kick to it.  Not too much, but just a hint.  Next time I am going to cut the sugar back to 1/2 Cup and shoot for using really ripe mangos for natural sweetness.  Definately a great recipe!",
