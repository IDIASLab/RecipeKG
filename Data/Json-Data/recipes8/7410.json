This was my first attempt, and some further tweaking is needed, like perhaps longer in the oven, and I avoided a mid-recipe crises by switching from sheet pan to glass baking dish (lasagna dish) when the egg mixture started overflowing. Maybe that was my fault for substituting with puff pastry, and maybe that\u2019s why cooking time was an hour or more, but, hey, the pastry dough was a classy tasty touch and the egg mix stayed where it belonged. I\u2019m saving this recipe to do again and again and again til I make it my  own. You should too!",
