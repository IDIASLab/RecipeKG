Next time I think I will still halve the recipe but divide it into 4 smaller pies (not that any went wasting) maybe using a larger apple or 2 small ones to get a bit more sauce I didn't need any cornstarch to thicken. It was very yummy with ice cream. It really does cook in 8 minutes at 390 (I don't have 385 option on my air fryer). I also didn't use the glaze it was tasty without since my pie shell recipe is buttery.",
