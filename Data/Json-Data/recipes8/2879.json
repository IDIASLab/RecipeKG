But after dinner he couldn't stop saying how fantastic these were and that these were definitely a \"do again\". I don't often make things more than once so it's a privilege for a recipe to be added to the \"do again\" file. Note that a pinch of salt really is just a small pinch of salt. I added a large pinch and it was borderline excessive. I guess it depends on how much salt is in your chicken broth too. Also next time I'll use less red pepper and instead of mincing the garlic I'll smash the gloves and pluck them out before I build the tacos. Also of note I was only able to get 5 tacos out of this recipe which was fine for me and my husband. If I were serving 4 I'd double the recipe. Thanks for a great meatless taco recipe!",
