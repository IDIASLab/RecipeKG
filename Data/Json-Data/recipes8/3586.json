I churned the first half exactly as written while the other half chilled in the fridge. It sat in the fridge for almost six hours. I gave it a quick stir before churning it. This second batch came out creamier than the first. So I suggest chilling the mix before churning. The flavor is outstanding in both methods. I used vanilla paste instead of extract. Thank you for the recipe.",
