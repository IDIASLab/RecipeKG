The breast was done; it came to 175 degrees and the red button popped out, but the legs and bottom were still pink and raw.

                "reviewBody": "Picked up a Honeysuckle Young Turkey on the day before Thanksgiving--looked for 12 pounds but they only had 14 pounds or larger so I got a 14.7 pound turkey. These turkeys were only 47 cents a pound so you couldn't beat that deal. However pulled the turkey out Thanksgiving and the inside was still partially frozen. Ran under hot water for an hour and 15 minutes and then was finally able to remove the neck and the giblets. Wanted to try a new recipe for the turkey this year so I went with this. I followed the direction exactly except I don't own a roaster. I cooked this in a regular baking pan. I also didn't really baste this turkey during the cooking process either. Cooked 1 hour with foil loosely covered and then 2 and a half hours exactly with the foil off. I admit I was honestly surprised at how moist beautiful and delicious my turkey turned out! The spices are just perfect but I didn't use all McCormick. I only used McCormick for the few spices I had to go out and buy to make this. After fully carving the turkey I simply put the juices and misc. through a strainer and nothing was stuck or remained in the pan. If you are looking for a new way to cook a turkey I suggest this! It makes a very well-seasoned beautiful moist turkey that everyone will enjoy and the even better part: clean up is a breeze! You can't go wrong with this.",
