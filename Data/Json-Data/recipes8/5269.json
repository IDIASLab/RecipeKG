I took julienned carrots and sauteed them in the same mixture of coconut oil, garlic and ginger until they were soft but still a little crispy.  Then I added a bag of frozen veggies (red pepper, green pepper and onions) to the carrots then added more hoisin sauce.  When the veggies heated up I put the chicken in and mixed it all up.  We had this on top of rice and it was delicious!  I will be making this again soon.  ",

Adding veggies stretches the servings-- I added green beans thinly sliced carrots and quartered mushrooms. The mushrooms especially added a really nice flavor. I cooked the chicken first then removed with a slotted spoon and stir-fried the veggies in the remaining sauce. Added some salt at the table-- next time would add 1/2 tsp or so to the pan. Great to have a stir-fry recipe that's so easy but with depth-- will make again!",

The only thing I needed to change with this recipe was to increase the amounts because I had 1.4 lbs. of chicken thighs to work with (I prefer thighs to breasts in stir fry). I also threw in some fresh chopped asparagus to add some veggies to our meal. Turned out great. Even my 14-month-old loved it. It's nice to have some recipes on here that use coconut oil. It is a great healthy alternative to the more common oils and adds a touch of flavor.",
