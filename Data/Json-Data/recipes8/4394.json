They're perfect on the side with dinner or all on their own for lunch. Kid-friendly taste and texture, and they'll never know there's a whole zucchini in there. Try one fresh-out-of-the-oven warm and spread with butter--delicious! Or allow to cool then store in a plastic bag or container at room temperature for up to 4 days (if they last that long).",
