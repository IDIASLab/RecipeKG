I don't care for horseradish sauce too much though so I subbed mayo mixed with some chopped capers instead which I discovered in another portobello burger recipe and HIGHLY recommend. There is just something about it that compliments the earthy nutty taste of the mushroom perfectly. I also brushed the mushroom with balsamic and spiced olive oil and added a slice of Monterey Jack cheese. Now that I think about it the way I made it pretty much destroyed the whole low-fat thing.. but oh well it was totally worth it!",
