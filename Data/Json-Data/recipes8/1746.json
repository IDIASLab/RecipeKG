        "description": "Mama made these for decades when she was a working mother (back in the day when most mamas didn't work).  These are easy, so moist, and so good. And because you make up a big batch that's kept in the refrigerator and baked just a few at a time, they are a lifesaver for busy cooks. My kids can scoop 1 or 2 into a tin and pop it in the oven in the morning for their own hot and hearty breakfast. A lovely addition to a brunch because they can be prepared ahead and baked right before serving.",
