I added Italian seasoning salt pepper and red pepper flakes. Instead of bread crumbs I used crushed Saltines. For the cream cheese I found I needed about 4 oz. of plain cream cheese and also added a few tablespoons of whipped chive cream cheese. I threw in a handful of shredded parmesan stuffed my button mushrooms and baked in a mini muffin pan at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. Fantastic! I honestly didn't think that one link would be enough- but it was plenty. I still have enough stuffing left over to fill at least a dozen more. UPDATE: I froze my leftover stuffing and unthawed it today. I stuffed two portobellos with it and topped with parmesean cheese. It was still wonderful. I definitely recommend making extra stuffing to freeze for later!",
