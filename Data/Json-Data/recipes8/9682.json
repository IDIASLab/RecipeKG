We were more liberal with the taco seasoning; didn\u2019t measure- just eyeballed it so they look properly coated. Maybe a half TBLS? The sauce was also great. But! I was a little confused; so I mix the sauce with the slaw? Or is it a stand-alone? Opted for the latter since I had finely shredded cabbage. It worked! I would consider adding pickled jalape\u00f1os or maybe a corn salsa for next time? This will become our stand-by  on those \u201cwhat to cook?!\u201d nights. Thank you!!",
