It was thick, but that was okay for us  If you are like another reviewer and expect something not too thick, reduce the amount of flour and corn tortillas or add more stock.  \r\n\r\nWe added some mushrooms and canned corn when we added the chicken and those were really nice additions.  I will defintely make this again, but next time I am going to roast and peel the poblanos since I think that will add a nice roasted flavor and remove the tough texture of the skin.  \r\nEnjoy!",

I took the advice of other reviewers and I used a good heaping 1/2 cup of the chopped peppers and added more chicken stock to thin the soup a bit as it cooked to get it to a not overly thick consistency. I also used closer to a cup of chopped chicken to make it even more of a meal. My only other comment is it makes a lot less than I expected: I do not know how Holly gets 9 servings from this unless they are very small. I would say you get more like four salad/cereal bowl sized servings so you may want to double this recipe if you want more for seconds or leftovers.",

Of course that was instantly evident from reading the recipe and I decided to go ahead. I liked the corn tortillas as the thickening agent and I decided to roast my poblano to add a depth of flavor. Based on most of the reviews I added more chicken stock but otherwise kept the ingredient amounts the same. This was made to go with chicken fajitas so I didn't add the chicken either.

First the recipe has the word \"Cheesy\" in the title but cheese is only used to garnish the soup. If you truly believe that this recipe makes nine servings then you would have less than 1 TBS of cheese per serving. I added the half cup cheese to the soup and mixed in before serving then I added more as a garnish. I used roasted poblanos as my garnish as raw peppers are not my husband's favorite. For the tortilla garnish I sprayed the strips with cooking spray and sprinkled them with homemade taco seasoning before oven toasting. I did have to add a good bit of extra liquid to this recipe.",
