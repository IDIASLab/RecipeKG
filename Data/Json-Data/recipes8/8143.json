The flavor of coffee and pumpkin spice is in every layer--from the crisp streusel topping, to the pumpkin cake itself, and then the surprise little bit of filling in the center. I highly recommend making this cake the day before you need it---the flavors get a chance to meld and are so incredible the next day.",
