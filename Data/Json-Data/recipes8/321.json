Very easy to make too! Very versatile recipe - use pink or blue sprinkles for a baby shower red and green for Christmas. The chilled dough is also yummy (even though I know I shouldn't eat it given the egg). I'll be making these again and again.",

I always skip the \u201ccreaming\u201d process and melt my butter and/or shortening. I know baking  experts will say that affects texture or rise, but this has never been the case for me. For this recipe I did the same and cookies were a hit. Similar to a shortbread but slightly less dense. Second time around I did mini chocolate chips directly mixed  into the dough.  Thank you for the recipe. Helpful to have a specific freezer cookie when baking so much every week!",
