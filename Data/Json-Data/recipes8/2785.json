I replace one can of soup with boiled cauliflower & carrot (about half a large cauliflower and a few small carrots) that I then puree in a blender along with milk and the other can of soup. My children don't even notice that the extra vegies are in there. I also tend to boil my chicken and then shred it. I just find that it's quicker that way.

After shredding it, I sprinkled w/more taco seasoning. I also threw the chicken in w/the soup mixture & layered chicken/soup mix, corn tortillas(chopped), cheeses, repeat. I had 2 cans of chili beans(also called mexican bean mix or chili mix in some stores) which I used in place of the chili w/out beans. It was incredibly good! It would be fantastic in tortillas, enchilada style but we just ate it straight & some scooped it w/tortilla chips. I'll definately be making this again! Thank you!",
