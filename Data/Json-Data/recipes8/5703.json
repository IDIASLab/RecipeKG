Besides wild rice, the real star of this salad is the dressing that uses curry powder to provide a delicious and unique flavor. And like a lot of dishes, it is best served after sitting overnight to ensure all the flavors get a chance to know each other!!",

I used this to extend some leftovers and I was a happy camper! My rice by the way was from Wisconsin (sorry Minnesota!) and it was a darker variety than what I'm normally used to. I would definitely make this again! I think apples would be good with this too. Thanks Scott N!",

The magazine version is identical to this one, with the exception that it calls for only one cup on mayonnaise, which is what I used.  I think two cups would be a bit much.  I used 1/2 tsp of curry powder and might increase that ingredient next time.  And maybe throw in a little diced celery.",
