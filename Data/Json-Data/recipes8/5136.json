I felt the cooking time was long for boneless chicken so I cut back. I used the cherry tomatoes but next time will use plum tomatoes seeded and chopped. I served over pasta but think it would be even better over rice. Topped with parmesan. Will make again. Thanks.",

I put black olives in it and sometimes some zuchini as well. I used chopped tomatoes in my sauce. But this is a good base recipe.",
