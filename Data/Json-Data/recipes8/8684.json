Everyone loved it at both superbowl parties we went to. \n\nI used the McCormick's pulled pork seasoning packet because our store didn't have the pulled chicken one. Not sure how different they are?\n\nI made it in the crock pot the day before, put it in a smaller casserole dish, warmed it up in the oven right before the party, and sprinkled a handful of shredded cheddar on top and garnished it with some green onions. It was pretty delicious looking and I forgot to take a photo, of course.\n\nAnyways, it easy to make a super good.",
