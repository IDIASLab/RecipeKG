Some of the people at the reunion managed to choke down half an egg but most took one bite and discretely threw the rest of the egg away. I should probably have tried this recipe out in private first. Using fresh dill might have salvaged this. One teaspoon dried dillweed packs about as much punch as 4 teaspoons fresh so it would be a lot subtler but fresh dill has a delicate top note that the dried lacks. It cuts the chalky aftertaste dill can have.",
