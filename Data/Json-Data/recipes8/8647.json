I didn't measure the amount of adobo I used (not sure how much \"1 serving\" is anyways, 1/4 teaspoon if I go by what the bottle says and that would have been too little in my opinion). I didn't change anything but if I had had gandules (pigeon peas), I would have probably added those instead of the petite peas. This is Puerto Rican comfort food. Very nice on a cold rainy night (like tonight). I added some sliced avocado on top. Good stuff!",

We love our traditional chicken and rice but wanted to try something different. I halved the recipe for my small family and made little adjustments due to availabilty; I only have pimentos itelf so i added a touch of that and to sub the salty/briny taste from the olives, I tossed a little bit of capers. Also used rotel tomatoes and green chiles, and just all red bell peppers. The broth is awesome. Thanks for the recipe and glad to see a picture to the recipe already.",
