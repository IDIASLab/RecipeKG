I loved how quick and easy these were to make too...just used a bowl and a whisk and they came together in a snap! I got 20 regular sized muffins out of the recipe and I baked them @ 325 for only 14 minutes (HOT oven). Laurrie, this recipe is PERFECT...Thanks for sharing. :)",

I found that it was easier to fill the muffin cups part way, add the cream cheese, and then put another spoon of the batter on top. This keeps your cream cheese at the center instead of at the top of your muffins. Next time I will double the cream cheese mixture so that I have more of it in the middle.

                "reviewBody": "I made these muffins because of the dark brown sugar and spice combination. The spices were great and the muffins super moist. However, I was confused by the use of baking soda and no baking powder. Baking soda requires an acid in the recipe to work properly and I didn't see an acid listed in these ingredients-so I used 3/4 teaspoon of baking powder (more is required because the leavening power of baking soda is much greater than baking powder)and added 1/4 teaspoon baking soda. I increased the cream cheese to about 6 tablespoons, adding 3 tablespoons powdered sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. I then put a very thin layer of batter into my muffin cups, added a dollop of the cream cheese, and covered with the rest of the batter-the filling stayed in the middle of the muffins this way. Finally, I added a streusel topping as others have suggested made with 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1 tablespoon butter because I wanted to add some more sweetness. I left off the sunflower seeds. The topping MADE the muffins and was definitely my favorite part. This produced 15, not 12, beautiful muffins, and, as I have found with all pumpkin bread recipes, the flavor improves the next day.",
