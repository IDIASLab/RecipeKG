First, they aren't the same as danishs so if that's what you are wanting then keep looking.  Second, these really should only be made with butter.  Margerine just isn't the same.  Third, we always prepare the dough the night before and refrigerate it overnight.  The dough needs to be cold and rolled as thin as possible.  I think this will help with some of the complaints about the cookies not sealing well.  Finally Solo filling really is the best.  The consistancy is thicker and better suited for these cookies.",
