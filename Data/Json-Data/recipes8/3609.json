I had chardonnay and sauvignon blanc in the fridge, and choose the sauvignon blanc.  Recipe didn\u2019t say to serve over ice, but that\u2019s the way I served it and would do that again.  I\u2019m not crazy about things that are overly sweet, and this cocktail had just the right amount of sweetness for me. Yesterday, I\u2019d sliced a fresh pineapple which I think only enhanced the flavor.  I didn\u2019t chop the pineapple, rather, cut it into tidbits, and that was a treat enjoyed at the bottom of the glass.  This is the perfect cocktail for brunch or a summer BBQ with friends.  Thanks for sharing, we enjoyed it.",
