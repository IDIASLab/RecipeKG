I put mine in the crockpot on low at 9:30 a.m., and it was more than done by 1:00 p.m. What I didn't like about it is that all of the seasoning stays on top of the skin, and because you are cooking it in the crockpot, you don't get that crispy skin that you want to eat. The seasonings don't really penetrate the meat. I would recommend maybe adding the seasonings to the butter and spreading it UNDER the skin. I did like that I didn't have to heat up the kitchen to cook a whole chicken in the oven. We ate it, and leftovers will be used for either chicken soup or quesadillas, so it definitely won't go to waste.",
