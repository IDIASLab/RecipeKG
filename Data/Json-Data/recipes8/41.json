In hindsight, I'd use 1-1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice. My lemon was pretty big, and yielded probably close to 1/3 cup of juice, which was too much. I did end up adding a bit more flour, so the dough wasn't so wet (probably 1/4 cup more). Also, if your dough is sticky, when you coat them in the powdered sugar, the sugar will absorb, and you won't get a pretty \"crackled\" look. On my second tray, I had to re-dip them in the powdered sugar because while the first tray was baking, the second tray ones had absorbed quite a bit of the powdered sugar. These are a tasty cookie, more cakey than chewy though.",

I like lemon extremely lemon so I added may be  1/4 teaspoon citric acid to the batter. I made a 5 dozen batch and was also worried about the volume of lemon juice, but since I always make a test cookie I figured I would just adjust it then. Low and behold I did not need to! I imagine that the people who said they turned out caky are the ones who added less lemon juice or more flour.  Mine turned out crispy chewy. A new favorite recipe!",
