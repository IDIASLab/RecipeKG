At the end, the sauce was very soupy and messy to eat, and I didn't much care for the texture or the flavor.  I thought it was the missing ginger.  But the next day I put the wings on a pan lined with aluminum foil and broiled them in my toaster oven for about 20 minutes on each side, and they were considerably better and the flavor was more concentrated.  I think they would take less time to broil if done directly from the Instant Pot, but they had been refrigerated over night.  I plan to get some ginger and try this again, but I'll definitely broil them afterwards.",
