That's good chicken. And you know it pains me to say that.\" And THEN, my 11 y.o. kid ate an unprecedented THREE servings of a non-dessert-related dish. It was like I won the Mom Olympics tonight. Got recruited on the Chinese team and plain won that thing. Many thanks for the recipe. I didn't have the fancy Chinese chili, so I used run-of-the-mill chili powder. Also, I put a broil on the last few minutes to give it a bit of edge. Apparently, it was all magic.",

I also have made this so often that I don't waste the precious sauce by marinating the meat at all!  I baste the meat a few times and save the yummy asian sauce to drizzle over the rice.

Spoon 1/3 of the sauce over the chicken before baking. No need to discard the marinate when you can just use as the sauce.  Also can cut back on the Sesame oil ( I used slightly less than 1/4 cup). Did not find this very spicy.  I marinated in the fridge for 24 hours and yum the meat really absorbed the flavor. Popped it in the oven the following night and it was a fast and easy meal. Used legs and thighs that I skinned removing as much fat as I could. Just make sure you bring the sauce back to a boil for 1 to 2 minutes after chicken is done. There will be sauce from the cooked chicken left in the casserole dish which you can use for extra sauce. Served it over sticky rice with green peas.  Will definately make again. Thank you for a delicious recipe Essanaye.",
