I needed to adjust how much apple I put on the 2nd layer of the muffin as I could have used more. I Put a streusel on the top instead of more apples but next time may try putting the apples on top. I baked them for 30-35 min . They are a little tricky to get out of the muffin tin if you don't let them cool. My husband loved these, I thought they could use a little more flavor.",
