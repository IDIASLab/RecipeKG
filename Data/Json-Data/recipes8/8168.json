Well pretty close anyway:-) For someone who can't eat Doritos anymore (corn chip allergy) this is a great alternative. I agree with another reviewer saying the recipe should've specified this is a large batch mixture of the spices - not to all be poured over 8 cups of popped popcorn yikes! I just store the mixture in a spice jar and sprinkle to taste over hot buttered popcorn. For those who said the seasoning wouldn't stick to the popcorn - you have to either pop your popcorn in oil or put some butter on top first - it won't stick to dry popcorn. Delicious recipe it is a keeper!",
