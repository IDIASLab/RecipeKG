First, there\u2019s WAY too much cinnamon sugar for an 8\u201dx12\u201d piece of pie crust, I stopped sprinkling it on about half-way through.  The instructions tell you to place the rolls \u201cseam-side\u201d down on the baking sheet.  The seam is on the side of the roll, so if you did this, you\u2019d be baking the rolls in a vertical position (think of how a tire looks on a car), so all of the butter-sugar filling would leak out.  Or is there something here that I don\u2019t understand?  I baked them like I\u2019d bake any other roll, in this case, with the seam on the side.  I understand all of our ovens vary slightly, but a cooking window of 20-30 minutes is too broad, this should be narrowed down to maybe 20-25 minutes.  I don\u2019t give many 1-star reviews, but reviews need to be honest to be valuable, and unfortunately,  this simply didn\u2019t work for me.",
