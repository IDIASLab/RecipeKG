I sauteed the veg and apple first for 5 minutes, before adding in the meat to brown.  The magazine version specified 16 oz. tomato sauce and 1/4 cup ketchup, plus 2 tsp. Grey Poupon-type mustard.  I used 8 oz. sauce (for less 'sloppiness'), 1/4 cup ketchup, and extra mustard, plus tarragon (dried).  I omitted the cloves.  It came out great!  My only quibble was the recipe was supposed to serve 8, but an honest estimation would be about 5 (if you're serving adults).",
