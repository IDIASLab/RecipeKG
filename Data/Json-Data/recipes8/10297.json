These individual tarts have a buttery, crispy pastry with a massive amount of apple flavor and they're sweetened just enough with a touch of sugar and cinnamon. Brush the tops with simple syrup or melted apricot jam and serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream, if desired.",

I \u201cbuilt\u201d my apple rose inside the ramekin rather than rolling it up outside then dropping it in. My puff pastry ended up a bit overbrown, bordering on burnt (still tasty), so next time I will bake for 25 minutes then check on it.",
