I was a bit concerned as to how much I would like the chocolate part but it was quite tasty. I did add a tad of jalepeno chili chopped finely and a bit of tomatoes in the initial cooking of the onions chicken and garlic. Also I added a tiny bit more chocolate and chili powder after tasting. I will def. make it again. Boardered on a 5 star!!",

I do enjoy sweet and savoury combinations however something about the way the sauce tasted did not please my tastebuds. I'm just glad I tasted this before cutting up the chicken and tossing it in! I have never tried a mole before. This may be for some and not for others. I'm not trying to give your recipe a bad name Deondra! I'll just have to look up something else I can toss together with the boiled chicken.",
