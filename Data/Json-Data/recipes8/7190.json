I cooked the green beans some before following the recipe because we like them a little softer in the casserole. Cook time was a little excess for my oven. Overall a good recipe but its hard to beat a classic. I'll stick with the traditional in the future.",

I saut\u00e9ed some mushrooms and garlic in the butter. I added the beans and stirred in the flour.  I added salt,  pepper,  paprika and Umami seasoning before adding the sour cream. I added a little cream to the mixture and then mixed in the shredded cheese and fried onions. I made the casserole the day before and stored it in refrigerator without the topping. While our turkey rested, I added the topping and baked it in the oven for about 30 minutes. It was a good addition to our Thanksgiving dinner!",
