I also didn't have small red chilies so I substituted crushed red pepper and sprinkled that in to taste. I did chop one half of a poblano pepper to give the meal a \"green\" taste and not just heat. Other additions were that that I cut up one large head of broccoli and sauteed that with onion slivers and the poblano pepper in a ginger-based stir fry oil. (The best General Tso's chicken I ever had contained broccoli; the standard recipe is very unhealthy if you make it without vegetables.) When finished I tossed the whole thing with green onions and sprinkled some chopped peanuts on top. Authentic General Tso? Maybe not. Absolutely delicious? Yes. I will definitely make this again.",

I wasn't familiar with the kind of hot peppers used so I put 1 1/2 Tbsps. of crushed chili into the doubled sauce and it for us was the perfect heat. I put one red bell pepper and 2 ribs of celery in to add some vegetables and finished with 4 chopped green onions and 1/2 cup of white sesame seeds. This will be made again and again and....",
