Used skirt steak worked well 3. Some of my slices were too thin-- turned out crispy and had to throw out 4. Would go for 1/3-1/2\" slices they turned out meatier and excellent 5. The recipe states to wipe off the marinade- we didn't do this some of our pieces had a glaze on the meat that burned I would recommend doing this for sure 6. Would go low on the smoker heat 175ish. We smoked at 200 for 4 hours and they were done. Next time will do 175 for longer. 7. Used Applewood which was great",

I sliced the meat a little too thick (rookie mistake), but it still didn't last more than 2 hours with just me eating it and I'm not even a big guy. It's not as sweet as you might think, it has just the right blend of flavors. The steak sauce is key! I used A1 and hickory wood chips, smoked at 160 degrees. I will never buy beef jerky again and am going to be making this again this weekend, I am even going to make twice the amount. This is an amazing recipe!",
