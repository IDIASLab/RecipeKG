My first instinct was to dust the chocolate chips with some of the flour and I should have gone with that as the chips sunk to the bottom of the cup. The top portion was cooked but the bottom wasn't. I did put it back in the microwave but it just made the portion that was cooked really dry. Sorry I won't make this again.",
