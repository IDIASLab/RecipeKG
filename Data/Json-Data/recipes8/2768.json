Personally I prefer to cook/boil dry pinto beans then mash them up while frying them in bacon grease just like they do in Mexico. If you don't want to prepare your own beans then use canned pinto beans instead. Anytime I make beans for friends they all rave about the taste. Try it and see if it doesn't improve the flavor. I also prefer a green salsa verde (tomatillo sauce) and jalisco queso instead of the red salsa and cheddar cheese.",

Also you can just use cooking spray to \"fry\" the tortillas and it's just as good but less fattening. Very delicious.
