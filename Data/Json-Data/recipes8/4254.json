I used some leftover homemade BBQ sauce I had.Not a \"wow\" recipe for me, but it was good and a nice change of pace.  I used center-cut fillets, about 1\" thick and they were done at 7 minutes. Keep an eye on the fish, because of the high sugar content, the sauce has a tendency to burn. I also wouldn't recommend using parchment under a broiler - use foil or a well-greased pan. I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper before brushing on the sauce - otherwise it would have been a little bland.",
