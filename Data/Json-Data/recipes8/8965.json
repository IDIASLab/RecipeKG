Tip: regular long grain will render a \"creamier\" sticky rice. Basmati will render a drier but still fluffy rice. Beware that it may dry at the top and become crispy like the chicken. To prevent over browning of the top layer cover the pan with aluminum foil and bake for about 45 minutes then broil uncovered for 5 minutes. This will crisp the chicken.",

Good basic recipe, just needs some upgrades.",
