I followed the advice of another reviewer and melted the cream cheese w/ the sauteed onions and I don't think that this is the way to go (unless you are VERY careful). The heat from the pan scorched the cream cheese which wasn't a problem really but I anticipated not being able to flip it out of the pan w/ some cream cheese baked on the pan bottom. (I removed cream cheese onion & salmon from pan cleaned the pan reapplied olive oil put the mixture back into the frying pan and then added the egg.) It was beautiful and everyone seemed to love it! I will definately make this again.",

I loved the blobs of melted cream cheese. This made the dish very decadent and I expect providing people like salmon and cream cheese it will be a crowd pleaser. I didn't use olives and used 3 tbsp of oil instead of 4. The frittata stuck to my seasoned cast iron frying pan but didn't burn. Next time I think I'll use 2 tbsp oil cook the onion/salmon then place the mixture in with the eggs. Then I'll add 1 tsp of oil to the pan and pour everything in not mixing it. Hopefully this will provide the bottom of the pan with more lubrication.",
