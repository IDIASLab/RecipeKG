My friends loved it, but for me it wasn't all that. However, the second time I made it, I did add two more tablespoons of cocoa to make it chocolaty. A tip: if you use instant coffee such as nescafe, put in 2 tbsp of instant coffee to a little more than 1/3 cup of water and let it steam, not boil. Stir and measure out 1/3 cup and let cool. The coffee really brings out the richness and taste of the cocoa. I also recommend not to add the baking soda to the dry ingredients. I always add into the wet ingredients just before adding the dry ingredients to let the baking soda do its job properly. I hope that helps! :)",

I read other suggestions though and because it had good reviews, I decided to try it.   The things I changed was that I didn't add any coffee and used regular 1% milk instead. However, like some of the reviews mentioned, the cupcakes did not whatsoever hold their shape, fluffed up, and went flat and spilled over. I'm still wondering why this happened especially since I followed the recipe closely besides the changes I mentioned.  However, they tasted great, but their structure was HORRIBLE. I'd definitely add more flour or something, but I don't think I'd do this recipe again. :\\",
