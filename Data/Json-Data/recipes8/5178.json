I have not found \"quality\" hot giardiniera since I left home.  I've even resorted to having some Chicago style restaurants ship me their giardiniera but I honestly have to say that this recipe tops the best of the giardiniera I've ever tasted!  It's not drenched in oil the way they are and it's SUPER flavorful.  I'm not even through the 2-day waiting period and can't keep my head out of the bowl.  I made the recipe exactly as stated except I cut the veggie's bigger (like back home) and doubled the olives (since that was always my favorite part of giardiniera.  I love hot food and this was perfectly spicy following the recipe.  I won't increase the heat in the next batch.  I wish I knew how long this particular recipe will last.  I canned it in several jars and hope this will help preserve it.  I will NEVER buy pre-made stuff again!  This is AWESOME!!! Thank you!  UPDATE: I just found this blurb from a site called foodsafety.com.  I guess unless you can eat this in 10 days...you're taking chances.\n\nCan the Italian condiment, Giardiniera, be made at home?\n\nRating: 42\n\nNo. The Italian condiment, Giardiniera, CANNOT be made safely at home. This mixture of raw, hot peppers and vegetables in an oil base can support the growth of Clostridium botulinum. Therefore low-acid foods, such as vegetables, that are mixed with oil must be kept refrigerate",

When I first found this recipe, and read the reviews, someone mentioned about making more and giving them a \"hot water bath\", which I am assuming is for canning and storing.

Add the vegetables and olives and heat through until just about to boil.  Pack the vegetables and liquid in jars and process in a hot water bath for 10 minutes.",

Giardiniera uses serrano peppers (~ 1 lb. for this recipe size) with no green/red peppers (although you can add red for color). There is also no garlic, onions nor pimentos (other than maybe for color). Vinegar is often not used, but can be...but at a lower ratio than oil (I prefer olive over standardized canola)...and it's not mixed. Once you've combined the seasoning w/veggies and olives, place into jars, add a little vinegar if you want it, then top off with oil. Let is sit for a few days, and the flavor will rock your socks.

I like to eat giardiniera as a snack or serve as an appetizer so I cut the veggies into bite-size chunks. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Next time I will add fresh whole mushrooms.
