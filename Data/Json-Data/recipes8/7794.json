Once the tortilla was refrigerated, it made it difficult to roll, and it tore easily. Also, I used small scoops of ice cream so the burrito wouldn't overflow. When you try this, I would use a small apple, refrigerate your apples to cool them off, and then assemble your burrito and eat right away. It was very tasty.",
