Super-Coupon Queen Jill Cataldo said, the formula for Three-Ounce Cake Mix \u201cUpsizer\u201d goes as follows: Whisk together 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda. \u201cStore in a clean mason jar. When you wish to increase a 15.25 ounce cake mix to 18.25 ounces, add three ounces of this mix (6 tablespoons) to your existing cake mix.\u201d  \nHi! I am the submitter of this (technique) recipe. I know using a box cake really isn't a recipe, but Allrecipes contacted me asking me to submit this because of the requests they received. So with that said, I submitted this so everyone can use my technique and have fun. You can use a box cake or a cake from scratch. I used Wilton (No Taste) RED concentrated paste icing color, and added a few drops of raspberry candy oil to the pink batter for flavor. You can add any flavor candy oil or extract.  Someone asked how to get the swirled look on the frosting. Here is how it's done: Paint a vertical stripe maybe 5\" or so on  the inside of a pastry bag, using a gel or paste tint. Starting at the tip end, you can paint one stripe, two stripes (side by side or one stripe on each side of the bag), or use different colors and paint a bunch of stripes. Just depends on the look you want. Then add your frosting, and swirl it on the cupcake. I hope that made sense.",

I did use Wilton gel coloring in pink and red, as that's what I had on hand (just mixed in until I got the shades I was looking for). I can't wait to use this technique for other holidays. For those of you who want to achieve the colored stripes in your icing, simply paint a stripe about 5\" long down each side of your piping bag with gel coloring. You can use one color or multiple colors, depending on the look you're going for. Carefully fill the bag with icing and start playing! Thanks so much for sharing, Celeste! &hearts;",

You may want to try this technique for a different look:  Instead of piping the colored cake batter into the center of the cupcake as described, use a Tablespoon full of one color batter and place it in the cup.  Then take another Tablespoon of batter and place it next or on top of the first one.  Then take another color and do the same thing.  Repeat until you reach the desired amount of batter in the cupcake holders.  Finally, take a long wooden skewer (or similar), place it inside the batter and swirl the batter around a bit - just like you would if you were making a marble cake.  This technique results in a \"tie-dyed\" look which is very retro and fun!  Enjoy!",
