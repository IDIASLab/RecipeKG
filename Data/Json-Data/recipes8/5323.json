We eat gluten free at home and I don't keep flour in the house so I was thankful to find this recipe. I also didn't have brown sugar so I used agave nectar as a substitute. I will say that I didn't actually try these but they looked fantastic and the pan was gone immediately and I didn't see a single person bring theirs back uneaten (which actually happens fairly frequently with our guests there)! The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that I didn't actually taste them.:)",

I might try adding some real chocolate next time as the very dark chocolate usually is vegan too. Will definitely make these over and over again!",

End result was a tad dry but still moist yet not a fudge brownie. I used superfine white rice flour as that's what I had on hand and it worked well (couldn't find All Purpose Rice Flour at the store). I used unsweetened coconut flakes and when tasting the batter was surprised I didn't notice the coconut flavor too much. When finished baking I didn't care for the coconut as it seemed to make the dryness more noticeable. Topped the brownies with Fresh Raspberry Sauce (from this site). Overall good recipe for a brownie and I'd like to try again without the coconut flakes and a little more applesauce perhaps. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
