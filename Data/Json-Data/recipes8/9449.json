        "description": "There's nothing wrong with the traditional method of making potsticker filling with ground or finely chopped meat, but something wonderful happened when I experimented with whole shrimp. A minimal approach to seasoning the filling enhances the flavor, while allowing the shrimp to be the stars of the show. And my favorite thing about potstickers is the contrast between one browned, crispy side and one softer, chewier, steamed side, which is how I cooked these, although you can crisp both sides if preferred. I just recommend you pick these up and eat them with your hands so you can enjoy every bit of the juicy, delicious filling.",

I made this and while the flavor is good I started the recipe at the top and completed the potstickers and to my surprise after cooking, I reread the recipe and tips to find the dough is for 36 shrimp. Had I known I would have cut the dough recipe in thirds.  This is a recipe for 12 shrimp in every way except in the tips at the very bottom does it say the dough is for 36.  No where in the u tube does it say that either. Next time I will be cutting the dough recipe.",

I found the whole shrimp inside hard to eat and prefer potstickers with a minced mixture inside. But the marinade and  the sauce are terrific! When I saw the dumplings not going so well, I took the rest of my marinaded shrimp and stir fried them then mixed them into some rice. It\u2019s delicious! The dumplings didn\u2019t taste bad even in spite of my stodgy dough. They were nothing to look at, but it wasn\u2019t a total flop. I probably would have been better off to use packaged won ton wrappers. I may try that next time and also throw my marinaded shrimp into the food processor before filling.",
