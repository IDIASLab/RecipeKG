The fridge again after rolling. Only thing differently I did was drizzle white chocolate over the tops. That was the key.  Wry tasty and cannot wait to make these again. They\u2019re strong and the recipe makes a lot. Great as a gift for the holidays. To me they\u2019re also sweet so half of one for me goes a long way. Thank you for posting",

To those who said they were crumbly, try adding a bit more peanut butter (I used 3 heaping spoonfuls)  and blend everything right in your food processor.   Blending the ingredients in the processor helps everything to stick together better.  I also rolled these in small bite-sized balls and got about 40 from this recipe.",

I had to halve the peanuts because I did not want to risk my husband having any difficulty with the nuts.  He has to be careful, so I ground them up really, really fine, and used half the amount.  I doubled the peanut butter to compensate.  I even had some really old whiskey around, and I used that in order to NOT have to go to the store for special peanut butter flavored whiskey.  I figured with the extra peanut butter, I did not need it.  But they turned out absolutely fabulous!!!!  Truly, these are to die for.",
