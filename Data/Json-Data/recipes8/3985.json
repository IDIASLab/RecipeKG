I used butter not margarine but otherwise followed the recipe as written and served it at a dinner party....and then shared the recipe with everyone there.  The crust is so delicious and unexpected I'd like to try a modification of it as a topping on a crumble.  Just the right amount of sweetness, the lemon really boosts the berry flavor and the creamy centre was divine.  I loved how easy it was to get it out of the pan without it falling apart as well - presentation was lovely.  Thank you so much for a new favorite at my house.",
