I followed most of the recipe but did not have leeks so I used vidalia onions instead. They added a lovely flavor to the soup. I roasted the butternut squash instead of sauteing it which always brings out a richer flavor in my experience. I also garnished the soup with fresh diced green onions along with the bacon. It was fabulous. A few family members are trying to follow the Paleo diet and this was pretty close to what is allowed. Next time I may try sweet potatoes instead of carrots as carrots are not allowed. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.",

The apple flavor was pretty strong and I wasn't sure I liked that combination with the thyme and sage. Then I garnished it with a lot of cinnamon a little nutmeg and sunflower kernels and I liked it pretty well. My wife fixed grilled bacon and cheese sandwiches with bread-n-butter pickles on them to go with it which was perfect.",
