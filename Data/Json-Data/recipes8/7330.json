I wasn't put off by it at all. Just make sure to cook the bacon crisp crumble and drain well. However I had to add more flour to this recipe. There isn't a high enough chip/dough ratio as written to help hold the dough(only I used a mix of white and milk chocolate chips) and my first batch spread so much they LOOKED like the aforementioned pancakes.:) So I just added another 1/4 cup flour remixed and refrigerated it for a bit. The rest of the cookies were fine. Even though as written these just weren't the right consistency I'm still giving it a 4 because the flavor which to be honest is likely what most folks will question was good. A very rich cookie with a fun \"don't tell them\" ingredient.:)",

                "reviewBody": "These were very good. A few changes that I made: First I candied my bacon. Lay out 5 strips of bacon on a foil-lined cookie sheet (preferably one with sides) and sprinkle with light brown sugar (about 2tsp per piece of bacon.) Bake at 400 degrees turning once. Once the candied bacon is cool crumble into bits. Also I could not find maple extract in my grocery store so I used pure maple syrup that had been infused with cinnamon. It made the batter delicious! Lastly I did not have a stand mixer available when I made these so I made them by hand. I let my butter get extremely soft then whipped it with a whisk for several minutes until it got very light in color. Then added the other ingredients as called for. There is a high fat to flour ratio in this recipe especially with the bacon in it (even if you drain the bacon there will still be a bit of grease that will get in the batter) so these cookies spread out quite a bit and get very flat. Next time I might add a little more flour to try and even out the fat/flour ratio. Overall a good (and very different!) cookie.",

I added 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, this controlled the overspread of the cookie. I also used a lot more bacon and chocolate than called for.
