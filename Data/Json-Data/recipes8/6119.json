If you're going to baste with the sauce, do it in the last minutes of of grilling. 3. Marinating the chicken and veggies is a MUST, and the longer the better. I put the chicken and veggies in separate zip-lock bags, and left them for about 8 hours. Every time I went to the fridge I turned the bags over. 4. If you're using wooden skewers, don't forget to soak them in water for a few hours, or they'll burn...I hate it when that happens. 5. If you lower your grill temperature a bit, you'll be able to put the veggies and chicken on the same skewers and they'll come out cooked to perfection. Place your hand about 2 inches over the heated grill surface. If you can hold your hand there for three seconds, then you've got the right grill temperature. If you have to take your hand away sooner, it's too hot. Oh, and you've got to add some pineapple chunks. Keep the faith and keep cooking.",

Added just a touch of cayenne pepper to the marinade and it was great!  Doubled the marinade as I did not want my veggies marinating in the same mixture as the chicken.  To grill, on one skewer, used red & orange bell peppers, and a red onion, as that is what I had on hand and these required different cooking times than the meat and other veggies used.  On another skewer, did zucchini, grape & cherry tomatoes from our garden.  And on another, used pineapple chunks.  Thank you, Ann Marie!",

I haven't had any trouble with lack of flavor; in fact, the other night I made this last minute and it only marinated about 30 minutes and was still delicious.  The kabobs are great, but one of my favorite ways to use this is as a sandwich:  leave the chicken breasts intact, or cut in half to fit a hamburger bun.  Otherwise, follow the recipe for marinating the chicken (I did put the garlic and onion in the marinade for flavor).  Serve on a bun (I prefer whole wheat) with swiss cheese melted on top, honey mustard, and toppings of your choice (lettuce, tomato, onion, etc).  Yum!  If you make extra chicken, try the leftovers sliced on a salad for lunch the next day.",

It took a little longer to cook this way (just over 15 minutes), but it also kept them from sticking.  We used onion, cherry tomatoes, and mushrooms, and these were the best skewers we've ever made on our grill!  We'll definitely have them again - the marinade just makes the dish!",

Made it Asian style by cooking it in a wok, then added broccoli and peppers and served with rice.  Next time will keep a lot more sauce aside to top at the end.  With the extra sauce, it will probably be a 4 star recipe!",
