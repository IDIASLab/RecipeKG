I spread the amended marinade mixture on pieces of dark rye bread and pumpernickel and then laid the marinaded/grilled shrimp (after cooled) on top.  It was awesome and everyone loved them.",

I ended up using half a lemon instead of the lime because I didn\u2019t have any on hand- I also added a combo of red pepper flakes & chili powder in place of the ground red pepper. Lastly I cooked the shrimp on the stove top instead of on the grill to make it easier- put about a tbsp of olive oil in the skillet and some minced garlic. Let that heat up for 1 minute then threw the shrimp in, allowed them to cook for about 2-3 minutes then added snow peas and sugar snap peas. The shrimp cooked for 1 more minute after adding the vegetables then I served the shrimp over brown rice. Absolutely delicious! Good next day too- I ate it cold (so the shrimp wouldn\u2019t get overcooked) and just added some sliced avocado... thanks for the recipe Jenny :o)",

I used jumbo frozen shrimp that was already deveined, just had to peel them (but left the tails on for good looks). I have also used fresh shrimp from the market. Both do well. The bigger the shrimp, the better. I have used bottled lime juice when I don't have a lime laying around. I have also substitued dry cilantro as well, but you get a much better flavor from chopping it fresh. I've made this several times and it's always a hit. Great summer meal!",
