As other reviewers, I eliminated the first 3 ingredients and simply purchased red enchilada sauce at the store.  Also, instead of the can of refried beans I used a can of black beans, drained but not rinsed.\nFor the beef mixture I added cumin and chili powder, as well as part of an envelope of taco seasoning.  At the end before I put the last layer of cheese on I poured about 1/2 a cup of enchilada sauce over the top.  I also used more cheese than called for, and used the 4 cheese mexican blend.\nMakes a TON of food, but I'm looking forward to leftovers tonight!!!\nUPDATE:  Sept. 2008 - I love this recipe!  What I do now is brown the pound and a half of beef (90/10 sirloin), drain MOST of the grease, and add one package of taco seasoning (I like McCormicks) and whatever amt of water it calls for.  Cook this for a few minutes and then add a can of diced green chiles, a can of drained black beans, and a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes.  Cook this all together for a few more minutes, and theen layer with LOTS of cheese, and the tortillas dipped in the sauce.  Top with EXTRA sauce, and lots of cheese!\nAlso, when I make this I make it in TWO square glass dishes, and put one in the freezer.\nServe this topped with some chopped romaine lettuce, fresh pico de gallo, and sour cream.",

I baked the tortillas for about 5 minutes to get them crunchy and I was glad I did and I used 2 cans of enchilada sauce instead of the packet seasoning I might use 3 next time and I used double the amount of cheese. Next time I make this dish I am going to use green chiles and diced tomatoes and maybe even some olives. Great recipe.",

I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 pan - and that made two big dinner servings for me and the boyfriend, with two nice-sized lunch portions leftover! A few modifications: 1) browned the ground beef with 1/2 diced onion, a 4oz can of green chiles (drained), lots of chili powder, cumin, and garlic salt. I used about nine corn tortillas (just tear them to make them fit into the pan) and did not \"brown\" them as others suggested - enchiladas are not crispy, so I didn't see any reason to crisp up the tortillas. I layered as suggested, but used a total of 2 cups of pepperjack cheese (so, double the cheese called for since I cut the recipe in half). Also, I had to bake it for 30 minutes to get it hot all the way through - 20 minutes wasn't enough. The only change I will make next time is to add more enchilada sauce - I did pour some over the top of the casserole, but there should be a layer in the middle as well for extra flavor and moisture. Overall, a tasty and easy recipe!!",

I used black beans instead and I think it turned out just fine! I will make this recipe again as written with refried beans next time. Overall a quick and easy recipe and the household liked it but no one RAVED about it.",
