It filled an 8x8\u201d casserole. I grilled the oiled eggplant slices on the barbecue instead of draining them in a colander and frying, since I know they would be dry enough grilled. I browned the ground beef in the microwave in a plastic colander over a bowl, drained all fat from the bowl and then added tomato sauce and spices and cooked till dry. I used more than the specified amounts of the spices as I like my food spicy.   Omitted the egg. Assembled and cooked in oven as directed. Mine was done in 30 minutes. This was very good but a bit too cheesy-the oils from the cheese made it look greasy. Loved the spices!,",
