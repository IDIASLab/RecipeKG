I made a few changes I used half the amount of recommended mayo (i used regular mayo not fat free) and doubled the orange zest which I added straight to the mayo. I also squeezed a little juice from the orange into the mayo then spread it onto the fish. I used macadamia nuts instead of hazelnuts because I couldn't find any hazelnuts in my grocery store and I didn't add any salt since the macadamia nuts already had salt on them. It came out delicious! Will definitely make this again!",
