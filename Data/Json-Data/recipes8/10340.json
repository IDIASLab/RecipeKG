With just a handful of ingredients and no messy stovetop frying, get ready to enjoy these crispy, caramelized potato pancake poppers. Pipe sour cream on top and sprinkle with chives to serve, or arrange on a platter and serve alongside an amazing dip, like a garlicky pesto aioli. They also make for truly fantastic breakfast potatoes to serve with bacon and eggs.",

Should garlic powder be 1/2 teaspoon and not 1/2 tablespoon?  And we found them very salty at 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (we used Morton\u2019s).  Possibly my potatoes were a tad tinier than yours though I did get 24 patties.  Will def make again but with less salt and garlic, and possibly go for slightly fewer taller ones.  I flipped them at about 30 minutes btw.",
