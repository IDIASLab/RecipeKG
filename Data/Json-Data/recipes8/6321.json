I grow my own mint and basil so that worked well for this recipe!  The only differences were, I added scallions as well which really added to the flavor.  I also made chicken too because my bf was afraid it wouldn't be enough (he was way off on that-my bf's dad even commented that it was so good, it didn't even need meat).  Also, I didn't cut my cucumber into matchsticks because I don't know how to do that.  Also, I don't know what diakon radishes are, so I used regular ones.  Every bite my bf's dad took he went \"mmm\" so I knew it was good!  It was a bit too fishy for me, so I didn't really use any sauce on mine, so I may try a different sauce next time.  Definitely worth trying!  Perfect time of year for it!",

I had my heart set on serving this with beef because of the photo though the recipe calls for grilled shrimp so I used an 8-oz top sirloin seasoned with garlic salt. I followed the recipe almost exactly omitting only the radish basil and mint. I didn't have pickled carrots so I shaved a carrot thinly with a potato peeler to match the size of the matchstick cucumbers. We only abandoned the herbs which I'd planned to cut from the garden at the last minute because the assembled plates (wouldn't fit in bowls) looked satisfying already and we were starving! It was delicious leaving enough noodles veggies and garnish to have for lunch the next day. One of the other reviews says this would be delicious without meat and they are 100 percent correct! I can't wait to make this again. My husband and I can't stop talking about how delicious it was and how unlike anything we've attempted to make at home. Maybe we'll try the grilled shrimp next time.",
