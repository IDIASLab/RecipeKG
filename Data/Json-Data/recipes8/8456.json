                "reviewBody": "AWESOME!! I love Chef John and almost everyone of his recipes that I have made have turned out great...and this one is no exception. I made these for Thanksgiving this year and my only regret is that I didn't double the recipe. I have several other recipes that are requested that I make every year, but this year, this recipe was the most talked about. As I was doing most of the cooking for Thanksgiving, I made several things ahead of time and either froze or refrigerated them. In this case, I made the gravy exactly as written two days ahead of time and kept it in the refrigerator. I made the stuffing as written except I didn't have enough home made chicken stock so I also added some from a packet. I used a mix of french bread and multigrain bread that I dried out. I would only give two suggestions or precautions. 1: add the heated stock a spoonful at a time until you get the consistency you want and let it sit a few minutes before proceeding so that the bread fully soaks up the stock goodness. 2: If you put your gravy in the fridge as I did (which really aides in the stuffing process) the baking time should be extended a little to make sure to get it heated up enough...5 minutes more should do it but just watch that they don't get overly browned in the process. As suggested, be sure to spoon the turkey gravy over the top. Yum yum. I think what really sets this off is using  the fresh sage. If you can get the fresh spices, I highly recommend using those. This is definitely goi",

Instead of filling the cupcake tin all the way up with stuffing, I filled the bottoms, spooned in some gravy - making sure to keep it as centered as possible with some room around the edges, then filled the rest of the way with more stuffing.  That worked out good for me.  They were super tasty.  The sausage gravy middle went surprising well with the stuffing.  I also topped mine with some turkey gravy and that just put it over the top.  Definitely a keeper and a fun way to make stuffing a little more \"special\".",

These muffins were so easy to transport. \n\nI did have to make a few substitutions based on what I had. I used oat milk instead of regular milk, dried parsley for fresh, and added more sausage to the country gravy than called for. Boy was that tasty!\n\nAlso, I used a mixture of 80% raisin bread and 20% sourdough (from a local bakery). I always use raisins in my stuffing so this made the stuffing mix taste more like my own. \n\nNext year, I will most likely use my own stuffing mix (with apples, nuts, raisin and sourdough bread, etc.) and may not even do the gravy in the center. As long as you have gravy or cranberry sauce to spoon over top, you really don't need it.",
