Every time I almost gave it a whirl I thought, \u201cManwich soup? Does that REALLY sound appealing?\u201d I finally caved. And it was good! I think the only change I made was using ground turkey and adding cayenne pepper but no additional salt. It was a crazy-tasty mishmash of chili, BBQ and Tex-Mex. My spouse loved it. Southerners may want some corn bread to go with it. Midwesterners may want some cheese. Either way, I highly recommend doubling the recipe. Quick, easy, and definitely different.",
