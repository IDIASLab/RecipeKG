It is a very simple white cake recipe, that works very well as a special occasion cake, or for something simple. It tastes like a sugar cookie. My son calls it the \"sugar cookie cake.\" Once cake is turned out onto the platter, you can frost it with your favorite topping, or use melted chocolate and sprinkles.",
