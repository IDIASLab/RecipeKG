I followed the recipe exactly but next time I will probably add about 2 tablespoons of palm sugar (to go with the coconut theme) since the waffles had no sweetness what so ever. I will also reduce the amount of salt to 1/2 t or even 1/4 t since it was salty to my liking. Also after carefully measuring out my canned coconut milk I realized that 1.75 C of coconut milk (I guessed it but I had to be sure) was exactly a can of coconut milk so people who are making this in the future can just pour it directly into the bowl. I will also sift spelt flour in the future. Thanks for the recipe.",
