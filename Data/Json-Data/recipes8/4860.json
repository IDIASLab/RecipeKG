I was so tempted to add other things and decided not to so that I'd really know what the recipe would taste like as written. (Well I didn't measure the soy sauce - I just held my finger over the top of the bottle and shook it over the 2 portobello mushrooms). I will definitely be making these again! Add'l Note - I have since altered the recipe by seasoning the mushrooms as noted and then stuffed with a mixture of chopped mushrooms(I buy 4 mushrooms chop one up and stuff the other 3) 1/2 of a chopped onion and 2 links of turkey sausage (either Italian or Cajun). I cook them about 20 min in a 400 degree oven. Topped with the bleu cheese at the end. The are absolutely delicious!!",

Perhaps it was the soy sauce but I followed the recipe exactly as it is written and my husband and I could not even finish our plates. I love the concept of roasted portobello with cheese on top so I think I will try this with olive oil as someone else suggested along with some sauteed garlic and onion and a milder cheese that melts better.
