The fact that it is GF is simply a plus, but will satisfy anyone; celiac or not.  The coconut flavour is not overpowering which is something I was concerned about.  They are easy and fast to make.  The ratios of flours and liquids are right on as are the instructions.  I used a soup spoon to drop the batter in the oil and they held together perfectly.  The first half of the batter I used as directed, then I added about 1/2 Tbsp of baking powder and that lightened them up even more.  The original recipe yields a light and delicious donut.  The addition of the baking powder rendered even more light and delicate giving it the stretch and airy texture you get with yeast donuts, the kind that simply melt in your mouth.  I ended up with 15 donuts, each about 2.5 inches in diameter.  Thank you Michelle2s for this fantastic recipe.  No need to cry when passing by the donut shop anymore!  :-)",

I made the recipe as instructed with only modifying the baking powder as mentioned in the review. They did puff up a lot more but almost had that bp aftertaste. Frying them in exclusively olive oil seemed like a bad idea b/c of the low smoke point of evoo so I went with half coconut oil and half evoo which worked fine. We are not a gf house but our diet is close so instead of powdered sugar I rolled the lovely donuts in evaporated cane juice. YUM. Thanks for this recipe! It is good and easy enough to make weekly and keep my family out of dunkin donuts.",

I made a cpl substitutions like almond milk for the coconut milk and xanthan gum instead of guar. The result was amazing. They were delicious and super satisfying.. They were a slight bit more dense than your average donut but still just light enough..I rolled them in brown sugar and cinnamon and all I can say is thank you for sharing this recipe. the measurements were perfect for me so they didn't yield a surplus that id end up wasting in the next cpl day.. just perfect..thank you a million times thank you.",

In response to foodiegoodie, you should be able to substitute xanthan gum for the guar gum.

I found that you need to make them very small (no more than 2 T. each) or they burn before the center can cook. Keep that oil under 300 degrees! Rolling them in powdered sugar just created a gummy mess and poor coverage, so I sifted the sugar on to far better effect. I also dusted them with some cinnamon. Finally, they have no shelf life so eat them hot. The recipe is small by design so that shouldn't be too much of a problem!",
