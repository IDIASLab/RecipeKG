I mixed the dressing up the night before so that the sugar would be totally dissolved when I was ready to use it. In the morning I mixed the broccoli red onion and dressing together. About 30 minutes before dinner I added the cheese bacon and sunflower seeds. At first I was a little worried as the salad seemed a little dry. But it was perfect when we had at dinner time. My DH even packed the leftovers for his lunch. It is the first broccoli salad that I've made (and I've made many) that he's really enjoyed. I think it was that everything was coated with dressing but not excess dressing. I did only use 3 TBS of white vinegar and that is the same amount I will use next time. Served this with 'Ham and Pineapple Kabobs' from AR. Thanks Magesse for sharing your recipe.",

This slaw turned out great and I got lots of compliments at our church Thanksgiving fellowship! I made some adjustments according to what I had on hand... I used red onion instead of yellow and I used frozen broccoli. I also used golden raisins and I skipped the sunflower seeds. I think chopped & toasted pecans would be even better. For the dressing I didn't use measurements but I think it was about 1 cup mayo 1 tbs vinegar and probably a little over a tbs of sugar.",
