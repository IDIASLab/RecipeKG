It all works together deliciously and is a quick and easy meal that's ready to go anytime.",

It\u2019s truly delicious and all the flavors do go well together. The only difference between mine and this recipe is that I use a cano of Ranch Style Beans(rinsed) instead of red kidney beans. Just because the Ranch Style Beans add a whole other level of flavor to the salad. I absolutely love this salad! Yummy!",
