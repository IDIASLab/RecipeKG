Letting the drumsticks air dry in the refrigerator overnight, combined with a higher smoking temperature, helps prevent rubbery skin that is common when smoking chicken. Serve with your favorite BBQ sauce, if desired.",

Yes, the legs will very well be done before the 2 hour mark, however, the point of leaving them in longer is to get a good amount of smoke flavor on them. In addition, the use of chicken drumsticks ensures the meat won't dry out and can therefore accept a longer smoke time. If you prefer yours with a light smoke flavor, feel free to take them out when they reach 165F. Enjoy!",
