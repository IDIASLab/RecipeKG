I started out with the stated 2 tbs of water but the dough would not come together so I kept adding more one tbs at a time for a total of 12. In hindsight I should have added an additional egg or two. Pasta made with semolina is heartier with a rougher texture that helps sauce cling to the pasta. I cooked this for a total of 8 mins in boiling water then added the pasta to a non stick pan with one ladle of the pasta water and two ladles of sauce and let that simmer for two minutes before serving. Thanks for sharing.",

This is the recipe I have been making for years give or take a tablespoon or two of water and when not made with Semolina flour it is a whole different flavor and texture. I swear by the semolina flour in the pasta I make it holds the sauce better and has a much better flavor. Thank you for submitting this recipe it refreshed my memory.",
