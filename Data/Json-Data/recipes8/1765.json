My bf said \"this one goes into the rotation\"! 4 stars because,  making this one again today, I will need to reduce the number of potatoes, carrots and celery from 3 to 1 because even though I used a large pie dish, the ingredients were overflowing considerably. That being said, the flavors are excellent. Bon apetite!",
