I prefer corn tortillas over flour but corn tortillas break so easily that it was impossible to put more than a pinch of filling in them to get them to roll without breaking. With that being said the ratio is off. You get a whole lot of fried tortilla with one tiny bite of filling. Even just sticking a toothpick through them made the corn tortilla tear. Even though it will alter the taste a great deal I recommend using flour tortillas if you want a decent amount of filling in your tacos.",
