I added a couple extra minutes because we like the cheese to be nice and golden brown. I was a little skeptical about putting the chicken on this raw, but it actually worked out really well and making it this way prevents the chicken from getting over cooked! I had a picture of it, but I think my toddler erased it when he was playing with my phone, haha! We will make this again trying different flavor combinations. Thanks for the recipe!",
