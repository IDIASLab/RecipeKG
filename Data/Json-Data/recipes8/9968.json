        "description": "If you're looking for a crowd-pleasing chicken and rice dinner that can feed an army, your search ends here. Chicken bog, which shares a history with pilau, is a simple South Carolina staple that has stood the test of time. This big-batch chicken bog recipe comes from Kent Huggins, a Carolina native who has perfected his family's technique over decades. What sets Kent's version apart? His chicken bog (which uses a strict 3:1 stock-to-rice ratio) is cooked in the oven. This eliminates the temptation to stir the rice and ensures a perfectly boggy texture.",
