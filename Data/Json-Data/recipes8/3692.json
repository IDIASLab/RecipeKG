I used Pralines & Cream ice cream and topped it with a bit of caramel. The flavors worked well together; it was again just a bit sweet for us. I'm sure I'll try this again at some point but I'll leave out the corn syrup. Additionally I think I'll try Peanut Butter and Chocolate ice cream topped with a bit of chocolate syrup.
