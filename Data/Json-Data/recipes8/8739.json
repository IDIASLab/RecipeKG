The bones with small amounts of meat on them I put in a large saucepan with water and simmered on the stove for the beginnings of soup. The skin I sprinkled with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and air fried it until it was crispy, turning twice  and then set the crisps beside the chicken when I served it. The completed dish may not have been as healthy as described but it sure was delicious. I used Panko bread crumbs which gave the chicken a wonderful crispy coating. I cooked the thighs five minutes per side at 390 degrees, spraying them when I flipped them over. Served with basmati rice and asparagus it resulted in a company worthy meal.",
