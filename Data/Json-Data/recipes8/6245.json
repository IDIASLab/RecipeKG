For this I didn't have any self rising flour but it worked fine with just using all-purpose flour. Everything else I left the same. I just wanted to use one package of hotdogs so I changed the yield to 8 and there was still a little batter left over. I ended up cutting the hotdogs into 4 pieces and skewering them with toothpicks. The batter was a little runny so I had to add about an extra 1/4 cup of flour to thicken it and I also dipped the hotdogs in flour before dipping them in the batter. that really helps the batter stick fairly well to the hotdogs. I will definitely make these again!!",
