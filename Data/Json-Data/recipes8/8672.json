I made a half portion (using skin-on, leg quarters) in a 7-quart pressure cooker. I started with a bit more sauce and water than written just in case. After 15 minutes, the chicken wasn't cooked all the way and needed a bit more liquid. After 22 minutes total, the chicken was cooked throughout; tender-literally falling off the bone; and juicy with extra sauce. The flavor was unbeatable. Really, really delicious. Thank you for the recipe.",

Halved the recipe (only 2 of us) and I cooked an extra 5 minutes but the sauce was still too runny and didn't stick to the chicken.  So I put the chicken under the broiler until crispy.  It did have very good flavor and was tender.   Next time I will probably only add half the water or none at all.  Update:  Made again using no extra water in the cooker.  Worked better  but still needed to broil to crisp and caramelize the sauce.",
