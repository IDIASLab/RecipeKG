My mini muffin tin for example, took two sorbet sized scoops of batter, so I only ended up coming out with 11 muffins.  Chef John\u2019s tins must have half the capacity than mine did. Also the batter turned out even thicker than in the video so I needed a couple of ounces more milk.   With larger muffins, the baking time needed to be increased.  The muffins came out tough and tasteless. Needs much more sugar or honey or something. The cornmeal could do with soaking first.",

The proportions just don't make sense.  Mine was almost unstirrable, and I had to add a bunch more milk to get it relatively close to usable.  I can see stirring everything but the flour and corn into the liquids and then slowly adding a cornmeal/flour mixture until you get what you want, but you'd never add it all (maybe half?)\n\nAll that said, they were tasty!  Also, don't think using paper muffin cups will save you from oiling a pan.  Ditch the cups and oil the pan; otherwise you're in for a world of frustration.",

Though I think chef John used cupcake trays, not muffin trays, because I needed to double the recipe to get 20.. Chef John had it right though, because my batter to dog ratio wasn't correct.\n\nIf I were to do this again, I'd find smaller trays so the batter to dog ratio is closer to a traditional corn dog.. and I think I'll add a bit of yogurt for moisture and tang.\n\nEither way, a couple of these with some mustard is incredible",
