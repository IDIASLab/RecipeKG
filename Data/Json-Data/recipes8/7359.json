No one even knew it was gluten-free; they just knew it tasted great! Since this was my first time making quiche I have to say the recipe was easy to follow and true to taste. Since I like salt I didn't change that quantity (and no complaints from guests), but I did use 1 c 2% milk instead of half&half for the filling. I also made the whole thing the night before so all I had to do was throw it in the oven before brunch, and it turned out great. I will absolutely be saving this and making again - thank you!",

I missed the author's warning about \"salty\" and, if you make it as written, it's quite salty.  (But then, the only time I like to taste salt is potato chips.)  The recipe itself is excellent, cooks up well and very pretty, and impressed my non-GF friends at brunch.  I used a fancier pie plate (one of those colored ceramic ones that are slightly deeper-dish) so I added two extra eggs to the mix, and it filled out nicely.  I think next time I'll omit the salt from the crust completely and probably from the egg portion as well.  But otherwise, this was easy-peasy and quite tasty!  (I used the Bob's Red Mill Almond Flour from the grocery store, by the way.)",
