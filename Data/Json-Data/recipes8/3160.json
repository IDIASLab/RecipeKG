They are more conducive to this simple but flavorful shrimp taco recipe. And yes! Have avocados chopped for topping. Perhaps even pickled red onion. Or? Using a bag of coleslaw mix, make Lick-the-Spoon Cilantro Jalapeno Aioli from this site and pour that over the coleslaw and serve with these shrimp tacos! Amazing!! Will make again and again!!
