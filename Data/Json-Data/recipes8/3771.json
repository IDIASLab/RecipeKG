What a great way to use a pound of ground beef on a cold winter night.Update!!! This time I made it with Italian sausage and used just one can of the tomato sauce . Since I was using sausage, I cut the salt in half. I sauteed the onion before mixing it in with the sourcream/cream cheese mixture. Topped with mozarella. Great results and I thin I will try it with chorizo and mexican cheeses next time. I can see so many possibilities for grandmas homestyle casserole. I have to add that the review by the \"Versatile Foodie\" seems hardly fair. She reviewed this as if it was some fine wine or gourmet recipe. This is NOT that kind of recipe and I don't think it has been represented that way. This is just one of those old fashioned simple casseroles that calls for easily attained and simple ingredients. Nothing fancy schmancy, just good stick to the ribs family pleasing casserole. Thanks for sharing LaDonna and Grandma!",

I topped the casserole with sharp cheddar, romano and parmesan cheeses. \nI loved this casserole, but better yet, my husband and grandson loved it too.

I added canned peas and fresh chopped carrots as well as parsley and I cooked most of the onion with the beef and only added a small amount to the cheese/sour cream mixture. I will make this again but sparingly. This is firmly in the comfort food department and can't be very waistline friendly...which is why it tastes so good!",
