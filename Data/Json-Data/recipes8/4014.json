It really depends what you are making. But if you are making pie crust, a combo of rice, tapioca and potato flour or starch works fine. For example, if you use in potato starch in chocolate chip cookies it makes a dense, cake-like cookie. I use sorghum, rice and tapioca for cookies now. It makes a texture similar to the traditional \"toll house cookie.\" Hope this help. Happy Thanksgiving.",

We do not have a gluten problem in our house so I did use my preferred crust but used the filling and it was really really good. It came out a little bit denser than I was expecting so may try a wee bit less cornstarch next time and I may also try ditching the crust putting the filling in souffle ramekins and then sprinkling gingerbread cookies on top of it. Amazingly good allergen free option I highly recommend. Thank you so much!",

Even though it wasn't done, I pulled it out of the oven and refriderated it overnight as called for. It was very, very good! I also used a store bought GFCF pie crust.

                "reviewBody": "My first ever gluten-free (vegan) pie - SUPER EASY and YUMMY! I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I mostly followed the recipe with the following exceptions: instead of tsp ground ginger I only used a dash and added tsp pumpkin pie spice; instead of canned pumpkin I used freshly baked & finely processed pumpkin 2 cups as called for; and I was unable to find soy creamer at the store so I used coffee-mate French vanilla creamer instead. Bake the crust 15 minutes no more no less. Follow directions exactly for the crust and it will turn out amazing flakier than a regular (gluten) crust and with WAY more flavor. Since I was using a stone pie plate I had already planned to bake the pie more than 60 minutes. My knife inserted 1 inch from the crust didn t come out clean after an hour so I didn t feel bad leaving it in for 30 more minutes. I didn t use the knife test again at the end of 90 minutes because if that wasn t long enough then there was something I did wrong with the recipe. Don t let the appearance fool you It won t look done in the middle but at the end of 90 minutes this pie was perfectly cooked. After I let it cool on a cooling rack on the counter for 2 hours it was indeed cooked in the middle. I made it the day before Thanksgiving so it sat in the refrigerator overnight. To serve I simply reheated in a 350 degree oven for 15 mins. This recipe is virtually fool-proof; it s easy simple and SO tasty! Highly recommended!",
