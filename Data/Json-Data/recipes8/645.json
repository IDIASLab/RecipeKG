Wish I could learn to like wheat flour more but unfortunately that s unlikely. And that s simply nothing more than personal taste. I m finishing out the bag that I have and it s doubtful I ll buy again (my husband s comment was good ). Although these baked up nicely and we enjoyed them I m going to try this recipe again very soon using total all-purpose flour. For us at least I think that will elevate it to 5 stars. You do get a nice little pop of sweetness from the cranberries an occasional crunch from the almonds and I could see using other dried fruit such as apricots blueberries cherries etc. for some variety. So very simple to make and tasty! Kristi Celaya thanks for sharing your recipe.",
