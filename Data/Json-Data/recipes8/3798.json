But I did make some changes -- I sauteed some onion, green pepper, and tomato in butter prior to adding the egg/noodle mixture. I also whisked in about a quarter cup of milk, half of the cheddar cheese, and some pepper to the egg/noodle mixture, prior to adding to the skillet. \n\nContrary to what someone else said in their review, this was not hard to eat at all! It had the same texture as quiche or any other type of frittata, and the noodles didn't make a difference in that regard, so that person probably botched the recipe.\n\nI served it with turkey sausages and toast!",
