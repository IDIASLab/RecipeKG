The only changes were I doubled the recipe and added 3 limes opposed to two(for which I used a glass lemon juicer to get all the juice possible and the pulp), some zest from one lime and instead of garlic powder I went with a fresh clove minced and I also added in some fresh cilantro for our taste preference.  Marinaded for 3 or so hours and I couldn't eat enough pieces.  YUMMY!  The perfect amount of lime and chili taste.  Will be making often this summer.  Thanks! ",

I wouldn't recommend marinating it longer than 4 or 5 hours though b/c I marinated for 4 and the chicken was starting to fall apart...the combination of lime juice and vinegar really breaks down the chicken quickly!",

I marinaded these for about 6 hours (using the juice from one fresh lime) but I still don't think that is long enough to get the good flavor that other reviewers have achieved. I was working w/ a new gas grill & I greatly overcooked them. But, as Michelle said, there wasn't enough flavor & what flavor did come through...was predominately chili powder. I added mushrooms & bell peppers to my skewers in hopes of making it a complete meal but I didn't marinade them (I don't think the lime would complement the mushrooms) & was afraid to add seasonings for fear of competing w/ the chicken marinade. The result...completely flavorless veggies that didn't add a thing to the dish. I don't know if I will ever try this dish again, I'm thinking that even if I had not overcooked it, that it still wouldn't have enough flavor for me ...sorry.",
