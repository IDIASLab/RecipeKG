For a faster way you can substitute pre-cooked can beans. I would simmer them for 1/2 - 1 hr at minimum.",

I made it exactly as written using ground sirloin (90% lean) for the ground beef. A little salt and pepper and the diluted beef bouillon are still not nearly enough spices to make this a tasty Mexican-style dish. I ate the first few as overstuffed tacos but it was pretty messy so I ate the rest with a knife and fork like a tostada. One complaint is that I found there were way too many beans for 10 of these. I thought I was generous when ladling the beans on and when it was over I still had two full bowls of a bland \"beans in beef broth\" soup left over. This recipe has potential but as written it's only a vague approximation to a great dish. Lastly I'd always known these as \"chalupas\" but maybe you're just having fun with the name of this recipe.",
