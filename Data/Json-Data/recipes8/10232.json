I don't know the names of the types I picked up but I chose red and orange ones and happily found that they were meaty.  Will go back and get more tomatoes to make sauce to freeze for over the winter. Then I followed the Chef's recipe and....omg..... it.  was. amazing.\nI've never used that type of meat b4 and it is amazing.  It melts in your mouth then rehydrates while it's cooking in the pasta and sauce.  I will never pour pasta sauce over the pasta again.  I feel like I learned an old Italian Grandma secret today....making that tomato sauce, .using that pork jowl and finishing the pasta in the sauce...... it's amazing and rich. It's a taste treat.

The only change I made was due to the fact that I don't have access to pork cheeks, instead I used thick cut, uncured pork belly, as it was as close as I could find.  It isn't salty, which is one of the main differences from bacon that Chef John mentioned, so I think it was a good substitute. I used the Fresh Garden Tomato Sauce he recommends making, and I gotta say, this might be my new favorite summer dish.  My entire family loved it.  Simple, but just bursting with flavor!",
