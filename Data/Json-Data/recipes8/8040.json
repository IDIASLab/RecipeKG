I made 2 batches and passed them out at work - every single person who had one, asked for the recipe.  They wanted to know what that \"amazing\" flavor was.  I almost wanted to keep the secret to myself b/c they are such a show stopper, but I gave in and emailed everyone the recipe and the link.   Jessie Sheehan - you have knocked my favorite childhood (and adulthood) treat out of the park!  Truly a home run.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  Take care.",

To me, this recipe is a bit too gooey and sweet with the amounts of condensed milk and vanilla. I think they, and the salt, though are fantastic additions to a regular crispy treat!   It adds a depth of flavor that is addictive and keeps the treats from getting stale/hard. It\u2019s gourmet without fussy extras that get in the way of what makes a crispy treat wonderful. They are sweet, crunchy, and childhood cereal great!!!  For my taste, I only use about 2tbls condensed milk and 1/2 tsp of vanilla.",
