Fresh chives and fresh dill is the way I chose to go. Nice. As for the vegetables I cooked them first all but the tomato which I sprinkled over the finished eggs upon serving. Substitute another herb for the tarragon preferably fresh or leave it out completely and you ll have some pretty darned good 4-star scrambled eggs. Rating this recipe just as written however I ll give it three stars.",
