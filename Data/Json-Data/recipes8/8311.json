My mom couldn't think of a good name for the casserole so she asked my brother and I for help coming up with the name. We named it 'Pig Slop' and as gross as the name sounds, it just works. You can call it Bean Casserole if the original name grosses you out! My mom would always serve this dish with cornbread, either on the side or she'd put the Pig Slop over the cornbread.",

She would make the recipe like this one only she'd use hot dogs if she couldn't afford kielbasa and mix up a box of Jiffy Mix cornbread and pour it over the top and bake it like that. We ate it up. It was filling and really cheap to make. To this day I still think of it as true comfort food. And I'll tell you my husband and kids love it just as much as I did back then. NOTE: If you can saute the onion in with a mess of garlic and the hot dogs then add it to the \"slop\" ingredients. The crispy hot dogs really make a difference.",

I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes as directed but it was still cold in the center. I ended up baking it at 350 for 90 (yes an hour and a half) before it was finally hot in the middle. It tasted pretty good. I used brown sugar baked beans so the taste was interesting. I think next time I'll use a savory flavored baked bean instead. Might even throw some jalapenos in there too. Bottom line it's pretty good. Just make sure to season this dish to your liking and plan on baking it for much longer than 30 minutes.",
