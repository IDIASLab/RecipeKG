                "reviewBody": "I love the combination of gingerbread with orange. With that said, these cookies were just ok for me. The cookies themselves are light, fluffy, and cakey; with a mild gingerbread flavor. No issues there. Where I found that it went flat for me, was when I added the frosting. The cookies and frosting, when separate, taste great; however, when combined, the orange completely overtook any gingerbread flavor from the cookies. They're not bad by any means, but they're just mostly orange flavored, with almost no gingerbread coming through. I was really hoping for more complimenting flavors from both. I also did not see what was to be gained by separating the baking soda and mixing it with different components in the cookie recipe--so I skipped that. No sense getting extra dishes dirty. Combine the baking soda with the dry ingredients, and the vinegar with the buttermilk to save hassle. I would also reduce the amount of cloves. They were a bit strong. For the frosting: I recommend creaming the butter until smooth, then mixing in the powdered sugar until smooth, then adding in the orange zest and juice. When made as written, the frosting comes out clumpy--with unmixed chunks of butter in it. Overall, I think this is a decent cookie, that has potential. But when made as written, it was simply 'ok.'",
