My husband and I love the different tastes of mushrooms and enjoyed the flavors of these two ingredients together. I could not find dehydrated mushrooms at my grocery store so I used fresh button Shelf and Shitake mushrooms along with the Portabella. In place of the liquid from the mushrooms I used 1 can of chicken broth. I will definitely make this dish again!",

My husband has and he said it was a wonderful recipe as did my step-son who would never have tried it if he knew there was pheasant in it!! The mushrooms and rice took all of the gamey flavor out of the bird and left a wonderful taste that I compare to the most flavorful chicken that I have ever eaten. I can't wait to try this recipe when my in-laws visit. They are big game eaters and I know they will love it.",

I read through the other reviews and put everything in a slow cooker after searing the pheasant meat and saut\u00e9ing the mushroom sauce. That was a mistake. Granted the sauce was delicious and very flavorful. However the pheasant does not have enough fat in the meat to be very good in a slow cooker so instead it comes out dry with a terrible texture. My recommendation: either make it as stated in the recipe or saut\u00e9 everything but the meat throw it into a slow cooker while letting the pheasant marinate and cook up the pheasant right before you serve it.",
