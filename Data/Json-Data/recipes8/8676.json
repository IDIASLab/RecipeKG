I felt the recipe needed more herbs but maybe that was my own fault for not using the seasoned tomatoes. I ended up adding some Italian seasoning but that was all. I really liked the hot pepper flakes and will double them next time. This was a good soup and one I will make again. It was super simple and is one that is easily adjusted to fit your tastes.",
