        "description": "This smells absolutely wonderful while baking! It's a simple, fall-friendly dish of chicken, apples, and onions. If you nestle the apples and onions down into the liquid they get super tender and are delicious alongside the tender roasted chicken. You could probably use just about any cut of chicken for this-I just happened to have a package of chicken legs in the refrigerator when I made this. The pan drippings can be turned into a tasty gravy, or just drizzle them as-is over the meat and some rice or mashed potatoes, if desired.",
