I added some cracked pepper to the pasta and topped it off with alfredo sauce.  What a spicy treat!",

The key for me was to do the mixing in a KitchenAid stand mixer.  Then I removed the dough and did the kneading on the counter.  Couldn't have been easier.  My one comment is that the dough needed more salt.  Also, I hand rolled my ravioli sheets, which probably meant I made them thicker than I would have if I owned a pasta roller.  My picky sons and husband both ate these up without complaining!",

I agree with others on this site that using extra large eggs would probably be better, but as I am experienced in dough making, I added a little bit more olive oil and a splash of water to get the moisture content correct. I kneaded by hand for eight minutes and set it in a zip lock freezer bag and when It came out it was satin smooth and went through my pasta roller and cutter without a hitch. I made 40 palm sized (using a tart cutter) super raviolis with this recipe and had enough left over for a quick bowl of basil and butter spaghetti (with roasted and chopped pine nuts) This recipe rocks!",

I am a virtual novice at cooking and have the patience of a kid (I\u2019m 50). I can cook, a little, so I\u2019m not the worst out there but not far from it. I tried this because I bought my wife a new kitchenAid along with the pasta attachments. Being a gadget kind of guy I had to try these new machines out. So off I went, on a mission to make pasta. \r\n\r\nI was a little concern I was about to make a complete flop. I got the right flour (went all over town trying to find Semolina flour, found it at whole foods), the right eggs (read to use x-large eggs), and olive oil. Mixed and kneaded it up in the kitchenAid then kneaded the dough by hand for a few minutes. Let it rest about 30 mins (read that too) and then got out the pasta attachments and rolled out perfect dough, cut it into linguini and was thoroughly impressed with how well things came together. \r\n\r\nI made a total of three batches, two of which My wife and I made raviolis. She is the cook and made a spinach, regatta cheese filling and we ate wonderfully all weekend. Now I have a lot of ravioli in the freezer and ready to try again. I did add some herbs to the last batch and found it harder to work with so I think I will mill the dried herbs to a finer texture before I do that again but it tasted wonderful. \r\n\r\nGood luck. If can do it anyone can.",
