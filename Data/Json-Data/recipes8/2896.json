Since I didn't have lime I used lemon (lime is best but I didn't have it on hand unfortunately) - I omitted the cayenne (kids) and added garlic powder. While the chicken was marinating I started cutting up my veggies I didn't have a red onion but yellow did just fine. Once the chicken was cooked I tasted... it needed some salt and a little more chilli powder cumin and garlic. AH yes that did the trick!:D IF you don't like the dryness of chicken breasts you can mix it up and cut up both chicken breasts and boneless skinless chicken thighs. YUM! Thank you for sharing this great recipe!",
