So your microwave banana bread recipe was ideal: Delicious and Easy! Only wish I used a larger mug as it did overflow. \n\nI was reluctant to try the recipe as nobody had written a review but am so glad I took a chance. After all, I\u2019ve made several of your other recipes that turned out amazing. Thanks for saving me all that time and sweat in making a very tasty treat!",
