More mushrooms (button) double the garlic cumin and oregano a can of pinto beans a bit of tomato sauce and beef broth and some sauteed celery and green pepper made for one hearty and delicious chili-like mushroomy dish which went really well wih Corn Muffins I (also from this site) and honey butter the first night.

TONS of garlic and the usual chili ingredients: carrots celery and more tomatoes than it called for. I used quite a few more seasonings also some cajun etc. and cooked it in a dutch oven iron skillet. Because of this I had to add more water at one point and ended up still cooking it for less than 40 mins (maybe 25? can't really remember). I also added ground turkey though it didn't need it...the mushrooms were fantastic in it. Next time would add lots more! They made the chili!",
