We did more of an asian flare by creating a sauce/paste before rolling it in the crushed chicken. We used soy sauce Chinese hot mustard hot chili sauce etc. besides the garlic and other items. It turned into a five star recipe once we added the other items. We served cucumber peanut salad on the side and it was a wonderful meal! Thanks for the recipe. We love trying things that are a little out of the ordinary.",
