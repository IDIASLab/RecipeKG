                "reviewBody": "I felt like these muffins had too much orange flavor and not enough sweetness, but my husband really liked them, so I give them 3 stars. The orange overpowered all other flavors, instead of complimenting them like in an actual cannoli. I would definitely reduce the amount of zest, and probably reduce the amount of juice too--as the batter was almost too wet with using oil, ricotta, orange juice, milk, and sour cream all at once. A bit too much moisture overall, because they also rose a lot while baking, but deflated once out of the oven and became a bit dense. In the future, I think I'd add a touch more sugar, reduce the orange flavor, and maybe add a bit of vanilla extract, almond extract, hint of cinnamon, and pistachios to make them even more like the cannolis I enjoy. Thanks for the recipe though--it was fun to try something different!",

                "reviewBody": "I normally don't like to review recipes I don't follow fairly precisely but I think this recipe has a lot of potential. My muffins were light and fluffy and mildly sweet. I used Simply Orange orange juice (only 1/2 cup) cut the zest to 1T packed added 1/2 tsp vanilla 1/2 tsp cinnamon and dark chocolate chips. I ended up adding a little baking soda because I ran out of baking powder (probably about 3/4 T powder and 1/4 T soda). Next time I will up the cinnamon a little more as it was not noticeable. A nice presentation would be to sprinkle a little powdered sugar on top like a real cannoli. These would also be good adapted as cupcakes stuffed with cannoli cream filling and frosted. Thanks for the inspiration.",
