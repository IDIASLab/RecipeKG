As Sara Jo did, I also roasted my carrots  - and prep couldn't have been easier! I only had one hiccup (completely my fault since I didn't follow becky's instructions). It took FAR longer than 25 minutes / 350 degrees for my carrots to cook thru. I'm not sure if Sara based her roasting timeframe on using whole or chopped carrots (which obviously makes a difference - I roasted whole baby carrots), so I'll just consider it a \"loose\" guideline. :) My carrots took nearly 45 minutes to cook, but it was WELL worth the wait! Roasting is just plain AWESOME - it brings out the natural sweetness that you lose with other cooking methods, IMHO. NOTE: I sprinkled my carrots with cheese AFTER they were out of the oven, but wish I would have tossed them with it (and the EVOO I coated them in) beforehand. What didn't adhere to my carrots ended up as clumps of partially melted cheese, but was delicious nonetheless. :) Served alongside chicken Parmesan, a PERFECT pairing! Thanks for sharing, becky! I now have a new way to enjoy one of my favorite vegetables! :-)",
