Firstly I thought this recipe had mangos in it but apparently not. So here's what I did: I kept the watermelon. I substituted the pineapple with mango instead. I used 1/4 cup of onion which was more than enough for me. I kept the cilantro and orange juice the same. I added 1/4 cup of pineapple juice. I used a little more hot sauce than required because I like spicy! I also squeezed in the juice of half a lime and a little salt to taste to give it that extra punch! I chilled it for 30 minutes to really get all the flavors nice and settled in. Came out DELICIOUS. My family loved it and I can't get enough. I drink the juice! Yum! I am thinking of making a ceviche next time with this recipe.:-)",
