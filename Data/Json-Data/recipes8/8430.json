I'm not an experienced dump cake maker or eater BUT the 20 or 30 that I've had from pumpkin to berry have all been the same hence the word DUMP in the recipe title. That's what makes this recipe such a wonderful thing. You mix your ingrediants put them in a dish and then DUMP the cake part on top. For the 1 star raters if you MUST have a bottom to this DUMP cake and serve it on a plate put some of the cake batter on the bottom of your dish.",

The crumb topping insures everything is adequately buttery and there is no pooling of butter.  Awesome.
