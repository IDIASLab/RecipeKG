        "description": "When I moved from Lebanon to Florida spring of 1999, I brought with me my love for cooking and search for new recipes. The famous key lime pie was new to me. It was a friend's best dessert, and he used to buy it from Costco every time we go for shopping. I tasted the pie at several places, but they were missing that wow flavor. I kept playing with the recipe, and the right flavor is found. I live now in North Bay, Ontario, and we only get the Key Limes twice a year, so sometimes I substitute with fresh lime juice. I hope you all enjoy!!",

I have my favorite Key Lime Pie recipe that I have been using for years, and I don't mind saying this recipe will probably take its place. First of all, the crust -the ground, toasted almonds take it to way beyond the ordinary. And then there's the filling - SO extra creamy! The heavy cream was a beautiful addition not only in taste, but its addition makes for a more substantial pie than others, filling the pie plate nicely. The combination of the novel ingredients of almonds and cream make for one, extraordinarily good Key Lime Pie, and with the perfect degree of lime flavor! As the first reviewer of this recipe, I can only strongly encourage others to give it a try! I can't imagine you'd be sorry! Edited 8/7/2011 - I use 1-1/2 tsp. grated lime zest rather than just 1/2 tsp. - perfect.",

The only thing I need to fix is that the crust was so crumbly it was difficult to serve but it was so good I still have to give it 5 stars. Next time I'll take some of the leftover egg whites, whisk them with a fork for a few seconds and brush the egg wash onto the pie shell before baking.

The cream is definitely a secret ingredient that changes the recipe from good to great.  I thought the lime flavor was perfect, following this recipe exactly.  Anyone who likes a strong lime flavor might want to add more juice.  I used bottled key lime juice; can't easily get the key limes in Boston.",
