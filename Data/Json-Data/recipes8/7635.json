Even my husband who isn\u2019t a Mac and cheese fan said it was pretty good. The smoked Gouda gave it a wonderful Smokey and smooth flavor. It was def worth adding the the favorites list.",

The only thing I wish I could change is when you make it as a one-pot meal, you don't get to rinse all the starch off of the noodles which makes it even a little more unhealthy and also a thicker consistency.  Other than that it works and is super fast!  I do add Dijon mustard and jalapeno's (family favorite)",
