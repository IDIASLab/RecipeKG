It is very good and combines the creamy texture of the cheese sauce with the crunchy texture of the corn flakes. It is a standby meal and easy to make, freeze, and bake at a later date. You can freeze it up to 6 months. If frozen, bake uncovered for 1 hour.",

With that said, I feel I have earned the ability to comment on and tweak this recipe...(A single working mother, mom disliked food prep and simply didn't have the time to cook extravagant meals for four kids). She would make this recipe with frozen broccoli and diced chicken breast.) *Please note, raw chicken adds substantial cooking time.* \n\nI remember this dish with its over abundance of fat laden mayo feeling too heavy.

Just moosh together.\" Not sure what the point was of layering broccoli, then chicken, then the soup/mayo mixture, so I just mixed them together. We also thought that 1/4 c. of lemon juice was too much. AR's \"Chicken LaPaloma\" is very similar to this, and I think I like it better b/c it has less lemon juice. The curry is the real stand-out here; it's unlikely that I'll ever make a chick/brocc casserole w/o it. Oh the only thing that I changed was topping half of it w/ French-fried onions (my daughter's fave casserole topper), and the other half w/ bran flakes that I'd mixed w/ a little melted butter, as I find corn flakes too sweet for some reason.",

Precooked rotisserie chickens weren't at every grocery when I was little. My mom always just cooked boneless tenders or breasts, then cubed. As a super lazy grownup cook, I buy precooked frozen chicken breast cubes and use frozen broccoli florets. The one thing I've done differently over the years is to increase the amount of curry powder. I'm up to about 2 tablespoons, but I really love curry. Don't tinker with the lemon juice! I've left it out by mistake, and tried extra \"just to see\". The first had no zip, and the second was awful. I have also had good success freezing, just add the corn flakes after it comes out of the freezer to keep them from getting too soggy. Crushed corn Chex works great, too. My family likes it with rice. Worth making enough to have leftovers!",

By the way I usually use leftover turkey (I freeze the dark meat we don't eat along with white meat, sliced/cubed/bits and pieces--doesn't matter it's good for so many recipes.
