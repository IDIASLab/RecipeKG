                "reviewBody": "First off, this is really tasty! The sweet blueberry syrup balances out the tart lime and spicy ginger really well.  Very refreshing and a perfect summer drink. One star off though for a few reasons. It's a little irritating when recipes aren't portioned out properly - in this case, there's  a TON of syrup. TWO cups of it, which is enough for 10 drinks, yet the mule recipe is for ONE drink. So keep that in mind. You might want to halve or quarter the syrup, or just make extra drinks, or use the syrup for other things.  The blueberry syrup definitely needed more than 3 to 5 mins to thicken; closer to 10. I also found it rather odd to state the ingredients in \"cups\" and \"tablespoons\"; in bartending/mixology, you use ounces. So for those who are wondering, to make 1 drink you will use 2oz vodka, 1/2oz lime juice, 4oz ginger beer and 1.5oz blueberry syrup.",
