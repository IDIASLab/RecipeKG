I was smoking a beef brisket, a pork roast, and some chicken and used this mix on all three. WAAAAAAAAY too salty!!!  I am not watching my salt intake, or on a salt free diet but I felt like Lot's wife after eating this meat seasoned with this rub. Recipe calls for 16 ounces of salt seasoning (I used Lawreys) and truly believe if I had cut that in half, it would still be way too salty.  We didn't even taste any of the other seasonings. so sorry to give a negative review but I fixed it according to measurements.",

I take a massive beef brisket rub it down good pour a couple of jars of barbeque concentrate over it wrap it in foil and let it sit for about 2 hours before slow smoking it at 250 degrees for 16-24 hrs. The tenderness and the subtle spices in the rub are indescribable. Highly recommended though it does make a LOT of rub (save in a container and use later still good).",
