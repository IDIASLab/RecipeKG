I made a few adjustments based solely on my own personal taste, but this was 5 stars before I ever got near it. My tweaks were substituting 2 tablespoons of siracha for the 3/4 cup salsa, using creamy peanut butter, using a full can of full fat coconut milk, 3 tablespoons of soy, & leaving out the sugar. again these were tweaks to adjust to my own taste.\nI served a bed of fresh spinach, topped with bean sprouts, topped with Jasmine rice, then the chicken, then the sauce . . .

The only thing I did differently is I used mild salsa (because that's what I had) and I used natural peanut butter (because that's all I buy).  It was good! I will definately put this in my rotation.  It's not strictly Thai if you are a Thai food conniseur, but it is a really great kids-friendly recipe, especially if they are not used to the flavors.  My 2 year old loved it. I love Thai food, so it was a wonderful middle ground between something I appreciate as Thai and something she will eat.  Great!",

Due to my love (some might call it an obsession!) for cilantro, I chopped up a third of a bunch and threw that in with all the other ingredients, as well as using it as a garnish, along with crushed peanuts. \nI also used a whole can of reg coconut milk, upped the pb to 1/2c, and lowered the salsa to 1/2c. Served over jasmine rice, and it still had that great peanut-y taste. Perfect!\nHubby couldn't stop raving, 2 and 4 yr olds gobbled it up right away-- will definitely be making this again!

We served this over white rice and it was so delicious!  My boys (4 and 6) gave it two thumbs up :)  Now that's what I like to hear at dinnertime.  This is a keeper!",

Also, I might add, I was a resident of Honolulu for several years so I am very familiar with this style of cooking.  Having said that, this is what I did with your recipe to make it my own.\n\nI pretty much doubled the recipe because I used a whole chicken, skinned.\n\u2022  I used smooth peanut butter.\n\u2022  Added 1 Tbl. of Fish Sauce\n\u2022  1 tsp. Hawaiian Sea Salt\n\u2022  I used Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce in lieu of Salsa\nWhat I did next may surprise.  I sat the whole skinned in my Wolfgang Puck Pressure Cooker.   I filled the cavity with the sauce and poured 2 cups of Chicken Stock into the pot around the chicken.  I sat the time according to my crockpot table.\n\u2022  When the timer went off and the pressure released, I removed the chicken from the bone and shredded it.\n\u2022  I retired the chicken to the pot and set it on warm and allow the sauce to reduce\n\u2022  It was delicious!\n\u2022  When it cooled to room temperature, I made several meal-size pouches with my seal-a-meal.\n\nFor Seniors, making meals in batches is important for those days we just don't feel like cooking.\n\nGood cooking & God Bless!",
