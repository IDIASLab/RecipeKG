It is lovely with hot toasted pita bread and veggies or lamb kebabs! The key is strain the liquid from the cucumber very well so the dip stays creamy and not watery and to always use thick, full-fat Greek yogurt. Low-fat versions won't cut it. Enjoy!",

Also, my first time using FAGE\u00ae yogurt, and that is just the kind of thick, yet creamy yogurt that you need.  Other recipes I\u2019ve made have used chopped cucumber, but grating the cuke incorporates it  much better into the tzatziki.  Thanks for sharing, winner recipe!",
