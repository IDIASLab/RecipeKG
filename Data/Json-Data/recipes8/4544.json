I used Costco's organic ground beef (85/15) and added 2 teaspoons of seasoning per pound (, as other reviewers recommended.  I'm not sure why Stacey did not include information in the orginial recipe, considering this is a critical piece of information.  \"Season to taste\" is hardly an option!  Anyway, I used a hamburger patty press to create 6 oz. patties.  We grilled these on a propane grill.  We would normally use a charcoal grill but since we were cooking for a large crowd, it wasn't an option.  Everyone snached these up fast.  Even the kids!  Thanks Stacey!",

I have never used anything before except maybe garlic powder and salt and that just made it taste like garlic podwer and salt. This is the perfect mix for some reason. Every bite was incredible. I made the recipe here without any changes. I made the burgers three times using this mix. The first time they were good but the next time I used more on each burger and they were really good. Tonight I put a lot more on the burgers and wiped it all over with my fingers so every part was covered. They were finally great! Now I know I need to be liberal with how much to put on and the burgers will blow you away. I liken the taste to Longhorn's bacon cheddar burgers. They use something called Prairie Dust on their burgers and some of their steaks. Thank you for this recipe.",
