Overall definitely a recipe to play with!",

I have had a lot of Moroccan food and am very excited to be able to learn how to cook it myself. Thanks for the recipe!!!",

There really are thousands of holes and you can see through them when held to the light! We served these delicate pancakes brushed with the warm Honey-Butter-Orange Blossom Water Sauce. Please don't skip the sauce - it's delightful! These are seriously addictive:) they are very easy to make once you get the pan to the correct temperature - you may have to lower heat as the pan will retain heat as it cooks. Especially good for novice cooks to make since they don't need to be flipped. My kitchen is very cool and my yeast was close to Exp. date; So, I also warmed the milk (used 1%)to 115\". After blending, I poured the mixture into a covered ovenproof bowl and placed in oven that was warmed on lowest temp for a few minutes then turned off with door cracked. I let the batter rest there for 1 hour. We made 4 at a time on an 11\" non-stick griddle and also used an 8\" omelet pan. The ones made in the pan were better shaped and about 5\" round, but we liked the smaller ones from the griddle better. I think the smaller ones would be better to roll and pass to guests as an appetizer - they're easier to eat with fingers. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!! We'll definitely make it a regular!",
