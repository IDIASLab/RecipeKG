Just a comment for new cooks\u2026recipe doesn\u2019t tell you to do this, but be sure to mash your bananas before adding.  The only thing that I would change in the future would be using 3 bananas instead of 4.  I\u2019m not convinced that fourth banana added a a lot more to the flavor,  but that additional moisture did affect the texture.  But also, my bananas were fairly large, and that may have made a difference.  We enjoyed this for a lazy weekend breakfast.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
