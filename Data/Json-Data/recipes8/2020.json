It's been my experience with baking that the harder a dough is to work with, the better it comes out and this is no exception--the contrast between this beautifully tender, airy dough and the sweet, crunchy, sticky topping is just otherworldly.",

I used the bread machine to make the dough as I'm a walk away type of baker.  The most difficult part of this recipe for me is that my brown sugar was hard so I had to get it out of the container and soften it in the microwave; otherwise, pretty easy.  I didn't oil the pan but didn't need to; the topping, which has butter in it, helped the buns come out easily.  I didn't even notice until after I baked this, served this, and we ate it that the recipe called for a 375 degree oven.  This is where it's handy to know your oven.  Mine always bakes bread and sweets (unless it's pizza or baguettes) on 350, so that's what I set it on.  Perfectly done at 45 minutes.  This is a good recipe, but the dough is a bit plain for us.  I'd maybe add vanilla or cinnamon, but we like a tad more flavor.  Most people would like this as is, I think.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I followed the recipe as closely as I could and I\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t do it as well as it could have been done and the results were phenomenal nonetheless. I may have heated the milk and water a little too much in the beginning of the process and stunted the growth of the used a little bit, if that is a thing. I also did not have a suitable metal pan and used stone bakeware. To top it off I somehow made eight rolls instead of 12 and used no pecans. The finished product did not last long enough for a photo to be taken. The whole family love them. Great recipe chef John!",

I replaced the pecans with raisins and maraschino cherries that I chopped as that was what I had on hand.   I used an 8\" square glass dish.  This was another wonderful recipe!  Thank you Chef John you never let me down!",
