I did make a few changes: I sauted 1 can of mushrooms in 1 tbsp of butter until browned then I added a few sliced onions and 1 can of beans. I sauted on medium heat until slightly browned then added the cooked crumbled bacon and 1/2 tsp of fresh garlic. I did not use any bacon grease to cook the beans. Thanks for a very good recipe for me to experiment with.:)",
