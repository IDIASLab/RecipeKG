But the more I ate it, the better it tasted--and I can't help but think how deliciously unique the flavor is! It's definitely a departure from our usual soups, and I mean that in the best possible way. We really enjoyed this! It's pretty easy to make too. I did do things a bit backwards (as I misread the instructions) in the preparation. I added the orange zest and juice directly to the blender, and added the 1 cup of vegetable broth to the shallots and garlic after sauteing them. Then I poured it all together in the blender. That worked well, so I might do that again next time! Overall, this has a really nice balance of flavors, and I will make it again! Thank you!",
