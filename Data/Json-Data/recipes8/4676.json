I did not use sage,my opinion is sage does not belong in this dish. I did use 1 tsp oregano,1 tsp basil, 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp accent. I also cooked the rice in the mixture and used 1/2 beef broth too. It did come out very thick but that is how we like it. Next time i will add a small can of tomato paste because i like more of a tomato flavor. I did not add taco seasoning like others did. Next time i will try this with cabbage. Thanks for the great recipe.  ",

Even though I cook my rice first before adding it to the mix, I do find there is quite a bit of absorption of the juice, taking away from the soup.  So what I do is add, depending on the quantity I am making, a few cans of beef broth.  I think using the beef, with the chicken broth, adds a little compliment to the entire mix making a great meld of flavors! Using the extra broth keeps this soup, just what it is, soup and not a rice mush.",

I also used 1/2 carton organic beef broth and 3/4 carton organic chicken broth and 2 cans of diced tomatoes coarsely pureed.  I added organic brown uncooked rice after the above came to a boil and simmered it for 45 minutes or so. Then I added several spices.  My family raved about it and said I could make it anytime! I probably just about doubled the recipe as stated.",

I added more minced garlic when I was sweating the onions and it was tasty!  This recipe does not have the overpowering taste of bell peppers and I love that.  After I added the rice I had to add more liquid because the rice soaked it up, but that's ok!  The day after it's good too.  It's more of a goulash consistency, but oh so yummy.
