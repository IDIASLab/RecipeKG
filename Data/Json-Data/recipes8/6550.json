Used a box of frozen chopped spinach that I microwaved and  then squeezed all of the water out of (Hint: try using a metal potato ricer for this- it really does the trick in pressing out 100% of the water from frozen boxed spinach and even canned tuna).   Took the pan off of the stove, mixed the spinach, feta and olives directly into the pan and then from the pan I stuffed the chicken breast pockets and then returned them to the same pan to brown in some additional garlic infused olive oil (one less bowl to clean).    Put the same skillet (All-Clad brand) in the oven to then bake. Found that my oven required  45 min vs. 35 min. of baking for the breasts to be fully cooked through.  Served with a Greek Salad and lemon rice. Will definitely make again!",
