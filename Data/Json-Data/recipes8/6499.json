It worked great but I'd like to try the tomato sometime. I cut back to only 1/4 c mayo and it was still very creamy. Also I just sprinkled on some salt and added black pepper too. The salad made a big serving so I didn't see the need to add another egg to the Bento. I finished the box off with carrots blueberries and grapes. Thanks for the recipe and the ideas.",
