I let the dough rest flattened out and it was very easy to roll. For the filling, there was no way I was using that much sugar! I just mixed about a cup and and a half with cinnamon and butter by eye based on the expectation I would be covering the rolled dough with 1/4 inch. When rolling, I saw nice air bubbles in the dough but it was elastic enough for no breakage when cutting. I cut the rolls into half inch slices and crowded them into a 9 inch springform pan. In the oven, the filling candied just fine and uniformly raised together. They took longer to bake than the instructions, but I did not note the time, maybe 25 minutes? The minute I took them out of the oven, they collapsed. They did not retain any structure\u2014they are just drop biscuits pretending to be a roll. Disappointing.",

I finally spread it on parchment paper--no need for a rolling pin it was practically self leveling. The amount of butter in the filling gave me pause but those star reviews convinced me to try it. I should have realized from the photo there would be scraps of dough swimming in butter. Also too much cinnamon! By a cunning use of spatulas and extra flour i was able to scrape the dough off the parchment paper and into a \"roll\" that because the dough had no elasticity spread out into a grub-like shape. The butter in the filling never set up so I wound up rolling the grub into a Bundt pan to make a ring cake. Which might have worked except for all the butter. The dough cooked to pieces and the soup that came out couldn't even be called monkey bread. If I could give this recipe fewer stars I would.",
