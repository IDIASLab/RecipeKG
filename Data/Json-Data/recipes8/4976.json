The recipe calls for cooked chicken but if vegan you can use tofu instead. I used both. I had some in the freezer leftover from another recipe and thought why not? This turned out really good. Simple flavors but good. If you like some heat like I do give your bowl a generous squirt of Sriracha. I don't have much experience with miso paste but this recipe makes me want to start experimenting with it more. Thanks for sharing!",
