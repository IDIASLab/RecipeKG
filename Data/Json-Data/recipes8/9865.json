While I made last night for dinner today - I tasted a bite both while warm and a couple hours later when rearranging my fridge. Flavors were good, if not the same. Also; we found it just a tad tangy-acidic. Maybe the combo of the red wine vinegar + marinated artichokes? Or maybe I had a really potent red onion? Either way; to cut it down, I sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on my second serving.  Feta would be another option. A third would be to omit the vinegar altogether? I don\u2019t know. I like the ease and versatility of this and unlike some creamy pasta salads - it was light and refreshing. I plan to keep and make again - possibly tweak. Thank you!",
