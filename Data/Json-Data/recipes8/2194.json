        "description": "Best fish tacos ever. Anybody who eats these is going to tell you to go open your own restaurant immediately. I've had plenty of people tell me \"I don't like fish, but these tacos are amazing!\" My secret in this recipe is the diet ginger ale. A lot of people use ginger beer, but I like the diet ginger ale because I find the batter is lighter and more crispy with all the flavor you get from ginger beer. Make 'em, eat 'em, love 'em, add them to your rotation. Top with jalapeno slices, if desired.",
