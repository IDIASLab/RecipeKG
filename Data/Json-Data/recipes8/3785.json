Had this with Amish potato salad and this was more than enough. I made 6 of these and we could only eat one each....\nFor tailgating I could see cooking these and then cutting in half and using small buns for a perfect sized food especially since most of the time you've got tons of other snacks alongside. Highly recommend.",
