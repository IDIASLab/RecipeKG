Substituted sour cream for the mayo because mayo is gross and greasy. Came out delicious, should have left more seeds to make it hotter.\nSecond time, lower fat.  One reduced fat cream cheese, one fat-free. Turkey bacon and fat free greek yogurt instead of mayo/sour cream. I used one cup of reduced fat shredded cheddar/monterey jack blend, then grated 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar.  You could not tell that it had reduced fat ingredients, I still had a ton of taste.  Next time, a few more seeds to make it even hotter, maybe some hot sauce.",
