After brining my trimmed brisket for 5 days - rinsed it and put it in a large pot with 1/4 cup pickling spice and 4 quarts of water. Boiled/simmered for 2 hours then added my carrots and potatoes. 40 minutes later - added 2 quartered heads of green cabbage and 1/4 c. chopped fresh parsley and 6 quartered large russet potatoes. Was the best I've ever made - thanks so much - this brine is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
