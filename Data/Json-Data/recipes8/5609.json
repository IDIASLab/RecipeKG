Here's my recommendation for \"authentic\" homemade horchata:  put 1 1/3 cup rice in the blender - add about 2 cups of water and 2 cinnamon sticks and blend until the rice and cinnamon are roughly ground.  Add the remaining water and blend thoroughly.  Pour into a pitcher and place in the refrigerator to soak (overnight is best) - or at the very least 4-5 hours.  Strain the mixture through a sieve.  I doubled the amount of milk called for - and about half the sugar (a generous 1/3 cup as I like my horchata not too sweet) and a generous splash of vanilla.  PERFECTO!  ",

Also I made a syrup of the last cup of water, sugar, cinnamon and cinnamon sticks and then added it to the rice water. It seemed to help the sugar and cinnamon mix better that way. Oh and don't throw out  the rice. It's perfect for Creamy Rice pudding (recipe on this site)",

I found that the flavor was better the longer it sat, so I served it the following day.  There was a lot of undissolved cinnamon, but I found the perfect solution to be straining the entire mixture through a coffee filter just before serving.  Because it sat overnight, the flavor was still full, but you did not get mouth-fulls of undissolved cinnamon with each sip.  What I consider the perfect measurements for 10 servings is the following:  1-2/3c uncooked white long-grain rice; 8c water; 1/2c sugar; 1-1/2t ground cinnamon; 2c milk; 3/4c+2T sweetened condensed milk; 2-1/2t vanilla extract.

I too ground the rice and 2 cinnamon sticks together with 2 cups of water to soak them. Once I finished grinding I added 2 more cups of water and blended well. I soaked the mixture overnight and put it through a fine mesh seive. I added a 5oz can of evaporated milk for extra creaminess as I only had 2% milk. I poured the evaporated milk into measuring cup and then the regular milk to make up the difference for a total of 2 cups of milk, 1 Tbls. of vanilla and 1/3 cup of sugar. It turned out so creamy, refreshing and delicious and the best part was that it had a very pronounced cinnamon taste without being overpowering and none of it floating around in the glass. Will be making this for years to come. Thanks for sharing!!",

I only used a half a cup of sugar and it was still really sweet like horchata is sapposed to be. The problem with this recipe is the cinnamon. The drink turns out brown not white like in the picture. And I had to skim a lot of cinnamon off the top because it wouldn't blend in. The taste was pretty much right on just a little more watery then we're used to. I'm going to experiment with boiling cinnamon sticks in the water and then blending it with the rice.",
