On the second day I added some black beans and corn and it seemed to add some interest and more flavor. If I were to make it again (almost every dish deserves a second chance) I would not slice up the corn tortillas and mix them with the chicken. I would toast the corn tortillas separately and serve them on the side. They get a little mushy and disappear when mixed all together. Serve it with white rice for a color contrast on your plate.",

I also bought a rotisarie  chicken on shopping day came home and took it off the bone and was then ready for a quick dinner that night.

I used 2 cans enchilada sauce, 1 can Rotelle tomatoes, and 1 package of enchilada seasoning mix.  Mixed my shredded chicken with tomatoes and enchilada sauce adding the seasoning mix.  After bubbly I sprinkled cheese on top.  Then I put my torn corn tortillas on top and sprinkled rest of cheese.  Put the lid on pan and turned it back on just until cheese on top melted.  Served with sliced black olives, sliced avocado, sour cream, and black bean and corn salsa. Yummy!!",
