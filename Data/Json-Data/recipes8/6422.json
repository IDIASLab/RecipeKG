I had to sub fresh squeezed OJ for the orange marmalade as I never keep anything that sweet in the house plus most have HFCS, was thinking of adding some natural honey, but decided to skip that and as I never salt anything (I let others decide on their salt level) left both salts out as well (recipe already has garlic.) Everything else the same. I think this would be good to use as a salad dressing too. I marinated separately as suggested (veggies apart from chicken) for about two hours. Will definitely make again!",
