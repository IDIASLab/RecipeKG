Being a lover of spice...I up all of them by just a titch. I prefer to bake my loaves in my mini 8-loaf pan and bake for 25-30 min. max. It's a keeper!",

I also used 3 TBS oil and 1/4 cup applesauce to make it a bit healthier. Then, I subbed some chocolate chips instead of the raisins, so that probably made it less healthy! No nuts because my son doesn't like them. The pumpkin spice flavor is there, but not over powering. The banana flavor is just a hint. I made them into muffins, cooked at 350 for 17  minutes.",

This bread is perfectly spicy sweet moist and pumpkin-y! To make it a bit more 'healthy' I used maple syrup in place of the sugar (only 3/4 cup) and whole milk Greek yogurt in place of the oil. Added a touch more of the spices as I love a good strong spice flavor. Kept everything else the same. It was really easy to throw this together too! My bread only needed 50 minutes to bake and it did begin to get too brown on the outside. So I think I would bake it at 350 next time. Thanks for the great recipe!",
