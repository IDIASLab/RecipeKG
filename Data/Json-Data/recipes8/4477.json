I have made this recipe as is, BUT I always reduce  the ginger, that has to be a typo.  I've also added 2 T orange marmalade and cut the vinegar a bit, 1 t sesame oil, 1/2 a teaspoon of Siracha Hot Chili Sauce.  Doing so makes the sauce over the top!!   I've also just made the sauce alone to add to other stir fry's as substituting the beef for chicken breasts, even tofu nuggets. I have learned that to prevent to much  cornstarch from falling into the oil, let the cornstarch covered meat slices rest 10 minutes, then place meat in a pasta colander and shake over the sink, then fry the meat, QUICKLY.. comes out perfect every time.  Then serve topped with a sprinkle of green onion and sesame seeds.  In fact, I often just serve this with  garlic green beans an Jasmine rice, rather than the broccoli. When making your Jasmine rice, saute 1/4 cup of rice in 1 Tablespoon hot oil until golden brown, then add the remaining rice and water to boil, gives a great nutty flavor to boring white rice. Also, \"Fried Rice with Cilantro\" from this site is also great with this.",

I followed the suggestion of others and reduced the sugar by half doubled the sauce and left the beef strips sit with the corn starch on them for 10 min. The only thing missing was 'crispy' beef - I let the oil get hot I tried to not overcook the strips and sliced them as thin as possible.They just were not really crispy. Could it be the oil I used - canola? Nevertheless the flavour and tenderness were perfect. On sticky white rice - I was in heaven. Prep time took aprox 90 min. Highly recommended. March 10' tried it again - same result almost all of the starch came off the meat into the hot oil - doesn't stick.",

In my wok I cooked a medley of frozen veggies fresh onion garlic ginger and bean spouts. When that was done I added olive oil to the hot wok and cooked the meat. I bought the already sliced \"stir fry\" beef which proved to be a time saver. After the beef was done I put all the soy sauce mixture in the pan and cooked it until it started to thicken then I added the beef back in. My family loved it and there were arguments over who got to keep the leftovers. Thanks so much for this!",

I didn't like the cornstarch-coated fried beef at ALL so instead I mixed 1 tablespoon of corn starch with 1 tablespoon of soy sauce (for 1lb of meat) tossed the beef in that and then seared the meat in some olive oil on medium-high to high heat. I seasoned it with just a little pepper and a dash of salt. (not too much since I used soy sauce on it). This really locked in the juices. I also added an onion chopped a green pepper chopped some chives coarsely chopped and a dash of red pepper flakes. Remember to double the sauce if you're making 1.5lbs of meat. If you're only making 1lb it's fine as is. Not a bad recipe at all and definitely one I'll make again (have made it three times so far) but it isn't the best I've found.",

Used 1/3 cup fresh OJ and a few TB of marmalade instead of the concentrate and zest. I needed to add cornstarch to the sauce at the end because it would not thicken and that worked but in the meantime caused the beef to overcook. Other than that a very tasty dish. Oh had a very hard time making the beef \"crispy.\"",
