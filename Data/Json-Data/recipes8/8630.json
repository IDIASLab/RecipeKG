We tried Chicken rather than pork for something different. Other than what is in this recipe we changed Bay Leaf for some dill weed and parsley. We also added a teaspoon of sugar for a little extra flavoring. We also had about a teaspoon of pepper and salt. It turned out really good. I would definitely use this recipe again. Also to finish it off we topped it with sour cream for a final dish to serve. It will be a great dish for our New Years celebration tomorrow.",
