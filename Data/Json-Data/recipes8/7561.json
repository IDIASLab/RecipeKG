Instead of frying the broccoli, I put a little bit of chicken broth in the bottom of a pot with a steamer. I steamed the broccoli until it was perfectly crisp tender. Then, I used the chicken broth to thin the pesto in a frying pan, then added the broccoli and cooked pasta. I didn\u2019t have bacon, so I diced a chicken breast and saut\u00e9ed it with a little bit of Italian dressing and put it on top of the pasta dish.  So delicious!
