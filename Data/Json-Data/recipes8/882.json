The ratio of the milk-to-solids was *way* off so it never thickened up (my topping ended up being more like a flat, tasteless pancake). Afterwards, looking over other tamale pie recipes, it looks like this one is missing flour. The meat mixture was good but I suggest using a different recipe for the cornbread topping.",

I pretty much followed the recipe, but substituted ground turkey for the beef (which was fine, since there was sufficient sauce and spices). Also decided to substitute a can of beans for the olives...was going to add the olives to the topping but didn't because I was in a hurry. Maybe next time I will also consider adding some diced zucchini for extra veggies. The addition of the eggs to the cornmeal topping made for a nice, fluffy crust that had the added plus of being gluten-free. I think this is the best tamale pie recipe I ever tried!",

I made this in my large cast-iron skillet instead of a 9x13 skillet making it a one-dish dinner. Then we topped our tamale pie with crema. This is a recipe  I have been asked to make this again.",
