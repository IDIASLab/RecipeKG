Roast the chilies on a flat grill or pan till they are roasted on all sides, (watch them so they don't burn, this will be quick;  brings out the flavor a little more).  This shouldn't take long.  Immediately soak them in hot water till they are soft.  In a blender add the chilies (remove tops and seeds depending on how hot you want it), water (a bit at a time), add onion, garlic, oregano and salt.  (the measurements are small, but you will get them down depending on your taste).  My mom also adds Masa Harina (the corn meal used to make tamales) to thicken it a little if it is too runny.  Strain the mixture into a warm pan to keep hot.  The tortillas are fried a little bit first then dipped in the sauce.  If you don't want to fry them I have also heated them in a pan or grill till they are slightly crispy.  We make our enchiladas as layers so simply piling them on top of each other with layers of cheese, shredded chicken (to the chicken we add a little of the enchilada sauce first), and onions.  YUM :)",

I blended them with the liquid and then strained it back in the sauce pan put it back on the heat to cook down a bit. Dipping first in the sauce fried out the flavor of the sauce. I also agree that the filling should be a melting cheese like Chihuahua and save the queso fresco for the toping. Over all the flavor was good but the instructions seem to be missing pieces and vague. Maybe if we could all learn the recipe from her mother in law we'd get it! Thanks for a recipe that is truly mexican in style and not one of those oven baked drowned in sauce and cheese things most people in the US think of a enchiladas! If you have a mexican grocery in your area use crema instead of sour cream... lighter and more tangy on the tongue! (Don't forget a few slices of advocado and a sqweeze of lime on top!)",

This recipe was one of my favorites and it is so simple with pure tastes. However as with everything I touch I add a twist. A gorgeous combination of Arbol and Ancho chiles makes this sauce sing as well as adding a very scant amount of cumin (don't go overboard as this spice packs a punch with its distinct pungency). I also prefer to make my own corn tortillas as it's the simplest thing in the world and you are guaranteed the freshest possible ingredients. By adding a bit of chopped green onion and mild green chiles to the cheese filling you score big points in flavor and still keep the authenticity alive. I tend to like my enchiladas oozing melted cheese so after I plate them I add a spoonful of sauce a bit more crumbled queso cheese on top and slip it into a hot oven for a few minutes. Add the crema (or sour cream) tomatoes and lettuce and voila perfection! These are decadent and so wonderful. Also occasionally try the same recipe without the cheese and substitute spicey chicken and roasted potatoes. Mmmmmmmmmm....soooo good.",

                "reviewBody": "This is as authentic as you can get for Mexican food. I make a very similar recipe but with a chile verde sauce. You can either dip the tortilla in the oil and then the sauce or vise versa. I prefer to do oil and then sauce that way I can drain the oil on paper towels without losing any of the sauce. For the sauce do not drain the water when it's done boiling use that blend instead of new water. Also to flavor the sauce try adding onion and the chicken bullion with tomato flavor--trust me it makes it taste wonderful! Just throw everything into the blender and blend. You can use whatever dried peppers you have on hand (chile de arbol peppers tend to be more spicier than the other dried varieties). Instead of rolling the tortillas you can stack or just fold them over (like the picture). Although queso fresco doesn't melt very well you can't beat the light and delicious flavor. I always use this cheese for my enchiladas. I like to add chopped onions to the filling too. And lastly before you serve these pop them in the microwave to melt the cheese a little. My husband who is Mexican loves them with either a cheese and onion filling or with cheese onion and chicken. Hope this helps!",
