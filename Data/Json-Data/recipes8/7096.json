You can eat them fresh out of the pan in a bowl with a spoon, which is delicious with a glass of milk besides. This no-bake cookie recipe was my grandmother's, and my mother taught it to her children, and I will to mine. I hope you have as much fun making this either by yourself or with your children, as I did with my mom. Separate cookies with waxed paper if putting in a tin or baggie to prevent sticking.",
