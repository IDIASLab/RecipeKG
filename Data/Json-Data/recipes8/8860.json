I used fire-roasted tomatoes (instead of plain) because that's what I had on hand, and they added great flavor. This makes a really thick soup, so you might want to add a bit more liquid, especially if you are saving some for leftovers, as the pasta will absorb some liquid.  I found 3 to 4 hours to be unnecessary; 2 was plenty. I did need to add more salt than called for, but that will depend on the broth and tomatoes you use.  Next time I will cook the noodles separately, and add to each bowl before serving, just so I can store leftovers without the noodles getting mushy. A great way to serve a large group for fairly cheap!",
