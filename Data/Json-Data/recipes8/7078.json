You could definitely save on ingredients by only making a third of it. I made half and that was still more than enough. The marinade could also use more salt. I caution against grilling these small pieces for 20 minutes as you will end up with very dry chicken. I did 10 minutes over indirect heat (as called for) and that was plenty; 8 would have probably been perfect.",
