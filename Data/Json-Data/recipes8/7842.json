Perhaps not so pretty, but that\u2019s OK, because they\u2019re delicious!  Baked an extra five minutes, and the texture was moist, tender, almost a bit creamy, and oh-so-easy to make.  I could see adding a bit of vanilla and using mini chocolate chips rather than the regular size, but there\u2019s nothing else that I would change.  Was hoping with the word \u201cmuffins\u201d in the title that they might be something that you could pick up to eat, but they\u2019re too soft to do that.  One thing that I do like is the portion control  you get baking these into muffins.  Thanks for sharing, nice recipe.",
