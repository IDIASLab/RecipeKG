I followed directions EXACTLY.  I think that's important.  I'm going on a trip in a few days, and I'm baking 2 dozen of these to take with and share.  This does NOT taste gluten free.  It doesn't rise up as much as wheat based muffins, so go ahead and fill the cups pretty full. It took 30 min to cook the muffins, 45-50 min to cook the bread.  I sprayed the pan very thoroughly, as GF stuff tends  to stick.  Again, everything was perfect.  The bread did not fall apart, or have a dense texture like most gf breads.  Remember what yummy wheat-based muffins were like?  Well you will.  My next adventure is to try the recipe and replace the bananas with pumpkin!",

I used the gf flour recipe that already has xanthan gum in it but not all gf flour mixtures do.  Read the label if you buy a pre-made mix.  Xanthan gum or guar gum are absolutely necessary in this recipe.  When adding the flour to the wet mixture, mix for at least a few minutes with an electric mixer, not just until mixed like the recipe says.  That gets the flours/gum to work together better.  I used 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of the turbinado and syrup.  Creamed those for several minutes with margarine and 2 tsp vanilla then added eggs and 6 medium very ripe bananas.  My muffins were done in 20 minutes and raised pretty well.  I got 18 out of this recipe.  I am very happy with how they turned out.",
