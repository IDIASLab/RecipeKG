You can also use frozen beans. 2. Do not use 1/4 cup of oil I think it was way too much. 3. 2 min prior to turning off the stove add the basil with sun-dried tomatoes in oil. 4. serve and add feta cheese (a little goes a long way) I just used 2tablespoons. Look forward to making this again!",

The flavors work perfectly together and would be a great accompaniment to just about any meat. I had to use 2 skillets due to the amount I made but it worked out fine. I had to make them a little ahead of time so after boiling draining & then tossing with olive oil & sauteing I transferred to a large baking dish covered with foil & kept warm in the oven for about 20 min. Just before serving I sprinkled with the basil & feta and it worked out fine. Will definitely make this again!",
