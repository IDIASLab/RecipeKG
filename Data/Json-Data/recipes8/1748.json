We trade the traditional fried dough for an easier crispy wafer cookie, which produces a different texture but very similar flavor profile. Feel free to garnish the ends with pistachios, almonds, hazelnuts, or pine nuts, dress them up a bit with some drizzled chocolate, or simply dust powdered sugar over.",

I didn't have Marsala wine (or any wine for that matter) so I substituted 1 Tbsp lemon juice, 1 Tbsp water for the first attempt; then I tried it with 2 Tbsp of milk for the second. They came out the same each time. I would recommend getting 2 baking mats when baking the shells. I had trouble spreading the batter on sheets that just came out of the oven. The batter just wouldn't spread. So use 2 mats, or wait 5-10 mins for the first to cool completely.",
