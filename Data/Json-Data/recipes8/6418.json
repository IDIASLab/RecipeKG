I couldn't find the tamarind juice so I used apple juice instead. Rather than cook these for 2-3 hours on the grill I baked these in a 250 degree oven on a baking sheet with a cooling rack to raise the ribs up a bit added some apple juice to the baking sheet and covered the baking sheet really well with aluminum foil. This keeps the ribs nice and moist. Then I finished them on the grill basting them with the glaze. They were fantastic and I will make these again!",

                "reviewBody": "We thought these were a nice change of pace but honestly we still prefer the more traditional BBQ sauce pork back ribs. It took much longer than 15 minutes for the sauce to slightly thicken (the consistency was as thin as a marinade initially) and I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more of an \"Asian\" flavor in the sauce...maybe a bit too much honey IMO. The sauce was just a little too sweet for us so I did add some crushed red pepper flakes while simmering. I served these ribs with grilled fresh pineapple with chili oil and Asian slaw. I will say that these were the meatiest pork back ribs that I've ever had plenty moist and they did grill up nicely.",

Since the pork roast recipe called for a soy sauce and lime juice based marinade and cooking liquid I wanted an Asian style barbecue sauce to accompany it. I used this one and made it just as described with the exception that since I didn't have garlic chili sauce I used Heinz chili sauce and added minced garlic. I also added some red pepper flakes as well to up the heat just a notch. Perfect!",
