I do have to say, they are heavy on the basil, so if you're going to eat them on their own without the bun you might want to cut back on the basil because I felt it was too overpowering.  But with a bun and all the other toppings (cheddar, lettuce, tomato), the flavors balanced each other out and it made for a great burger!  I loved the addition of the Parmesan.",
