The cookie crumbs have nothing added to them, and they need to have some butter or something to bind and form them into a firm crust.  The way it is now the crumbs pretty much just fall off when you cut the bars and try to remove them to a plate.  The taste is OK, but I could see adding more chopped apricots to the batter and even a bit more apricot preserves to the topping  Also, the recipe doesn\u2019t say whether or not to store this in the fridge, but my instinct is telling me that it needs to be, so that\u2019s where the dish is going.  Pretty good, but not sure I\u2019d make again.",
