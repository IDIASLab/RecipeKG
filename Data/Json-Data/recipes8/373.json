I did make quite a few alterations to make a bit healthier: \n- I halved the sugar\n- replaced 1/2 the flour with rolled oats & ground flax\n- for the butter, I used 1/2 the butter  and 1/2 olive oil\n- instead of sour cream used a full protein skyr plain yogurt\n- used blueberries instead of choc chips - added a couple choc chips to top of each muffin\nThey rose nice & high, very fluffy, fantastic, will make again!",
