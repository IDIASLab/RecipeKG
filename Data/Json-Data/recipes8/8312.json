My hubby and son added some hot sauce to their bowls and declared it perfect!  I do not see a reason to put the veggies and olive oil in first.  I threw everything in together (with no olive oil) and cooked for 4 1/2 hours and it was perfect.  The veggies were plenty soft.  Left out the garbanzo beans.  They just sounded wrong with baked beans.  Overall an easy, comfort food type of meal!",

The beans seemed to be a flavorless filler and the dish relied heavily on the sausage for taste. The tomatoes along with the backed bean liquid would be too tomato-y. The garbanzo beans had a weird texture. using canned baked beans doesn't have the same depth that making your own beans. I wouldn't say that it make 8 servings. (well not for my husband).  I \"doctored\" it up a bit. I added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp onion powder and 1/2 tsp chili powder. Salt and pepper to taste. I added some water to thin it because it seemed too thick.  I used a smoked sausage similar to kielbasa called \"slovenian\" sausage I get locally. I served it over rice and with corn bread. I am not sure I would make it again.",

My oldest said it was weird and I thought about the same... The flavor was different had a weird taste of baked beans with a black lash of cumin. However I love all the ingredients individually but just wasn't my cup of tea. Even if i followed to a T. So sorry I don't even know how to correct this to make again. So there for I regret in not making this again.",

We don't love spicy heat so we found this to be just right and tasty. I made the recipe as written. I appreciated cooking the vegetables for an hour first. I had no complaints about crunchy onions in my slow cooker food! Everyone liked this dish. I rated it a 4 because one of us thought it was not hot enough and added hot sauce.",
