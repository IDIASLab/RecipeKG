I was entirely unsure about how an apple cheesecake would be, but , this was good.\n\nI used a food processor to chop up the apples as to make them thin as possible and I think it was worth it, as I wouldn't find it very desirable to have crunchy chunks of apples in the cheesecake. \n\nMake sure to butter the sides of the springform pan very well, releasing the cheesecake from the pan can be a pain if you do not. \n\nI also used roughly 2 1/2 honeycrisp apples instead of the granny smiths and it was also a good call. Additionally, I accidentally let it cook for another 10 minutes and it turned out great, gave it that nice golden brown finish on the top of the cake and the texture was very good. \n\nBe sure to not overmix, overmixing will make the batter to thin and cause it to rise too much, that was my main mistake, but it was still so good. \n\nFollow the directions for the rest, absolutely do not open the oven door for the 4 hours after finishing the cake. After that, directly into the fridge overnight. \n\nEasily one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made, top 3 at least.",
