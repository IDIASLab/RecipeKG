My Bundt pan is quite fancy and it didn\u2019t make sense to make it in that pan and then flip it over so that the streusel was in the bottom.  So instead I used 2 loaf pans.  Baked til it was done. While eating the cake I wished I would have tried it in muffin form- I think that would have been the best way.",
