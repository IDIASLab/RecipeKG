First of all, to save time and stove space, I cooked rice in microwave while preparing other foods. (used one cup uncooked rice) I didn't use celery, used 1/2 yellow onion, one half red, and 1 bell pepper. I added a little teriyaki sauce and a teaspoon of soy sauce to sesame oil when I stirfried my shirmp. When putting all of them together at end of cooking, the vegetables, shrimp, and rice...I used 1/4 cup of soysauce and 1/2 teaspoon of ginger, and mixed well...hope this helps.",
