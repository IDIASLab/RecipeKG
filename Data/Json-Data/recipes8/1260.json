You don't  see or taste the  zucchini. I did not use  vegan chocolate chips, I did use mini chocolate chips which was  fantastic a little peace  of heaven in each bite. They  are so moist. I  also made regular and mini muffins  ( perfect size for lunch boxes). My family and friends ( my tester) all loved them.  I have froze some and looking foreword to see how they turn out. We here in the middle of Kanas  love's this recipe. these.   It is a keeper.         Cheryl",
