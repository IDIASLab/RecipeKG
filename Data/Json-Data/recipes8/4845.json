Next try I used milk and no cream and it was perfect.  I balked at the lb of mushrooms, but it's a perfect amount.  Also, just personal preference, I used half shrimp and half scallops.  Exquisite!

I also don't keep \"cajun seasoning\" on hand, so I used 1/4 tsp. each of paprika, cayenne red pepper, black pepper, onion powder, and salt.  The cayenne was really what pushed this recipe over the top - combined with the creaminess, it made a really interesting sauce.",

I highly recommend it!",

I cooked the onions/mushrooms then removed them wiped out the pan (or sauce will be greyish brown) and then melted the butter and added the flour. Let it cook several minutes to cook out the flour taste then added the garlic (extra!) and spices. Let it cook a few minutes then melted in the cream cheese and slowly added the cream. Added the mushrooms/onions. Yum! Also I subbed spaghetti squash for pasta to make it a bit healthier.",

I used cookie_cooker's suggestions to melt the butter then add the flour and cook for a couple of minutes before adding the cream cheese and cream. The only seasoning I used was Tony Chachere's (I'm from Louisiana so it's a staple in my pantry). I used the whole pint of whipping cream but I did have to add milk (I have 2%) to thin it a little. This was delicious and quick! I was kind of scared to try it because a couple of people rated it so low...DON'T LISTEN TO THEM!!! My neighbor ate with us and kept saying how much better than the Olive Garden this was. I can't believe how good this tasted considering it only took me 30-40 min. to make. Thank you so much!!!",
