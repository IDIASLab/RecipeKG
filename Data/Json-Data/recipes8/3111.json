It has potential but needs more flavor. All you could taste was the sourness of the tomatillo. I have issues digesting pepper seeds so instead of grating them I softened them and then cut a slit down the side so that I could control the seeds. It released the perfect amount of heat so that isn't where the problem was. I really love tomatillos and wanted this to work. I think it would if you added some taco seasoning but I'm not going to go to the trouble of finding out.",
