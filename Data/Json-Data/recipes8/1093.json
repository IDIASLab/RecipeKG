        "description": "I wanted to make a lighter version of the traditional coffee cake, and came up with this recipe. We loved it at home! We eat it as a snack or at breakfast. This is a delicious alternative to the traditionally butter- and sour cream-heavy coffee cake. The raisins add a lovely fruity bite, and applesauce, coconut oil, and nonfat yogurt give the cake a lighter, naturally sweetened taste. Wrap in aluminum foil to keep moist outside of the refrigerator for up to 4 days.",
