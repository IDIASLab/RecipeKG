Cuban bread has a palmetto leaf placed on top center prior to baking to keep moisture in. The texture is crispy on the outside and very light on the inside.",

I melted some butter in a pan and pressed it down with my iron skillet on top. 3 minutes on both sides over medium heat. DO NOT SKIP THAT STEP! It takes this sandwich to a whole other level. After a few bites I swapped the pickles for banana peppers and it was even better!",
