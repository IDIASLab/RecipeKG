The batter looked pale so I doubled the cocoa to make it more rich.  It\u2019s a very thin layer of brownie in the 13\u201d x 9\u201d pan, so if you are looking for a thicker brownie, I would use a 11\u201d x 8\u201d pan.   The marshmallow layer took longer than 3 minutes to bake.  After baking for 10 minutes, they still were not melted and I was afraid that the brownie might become dry, so I turned on the broiler and that accomplished it.  Brownie layer and marshmallows were perfectly done.  Final layer was done as written.  Very rich and delicious.  Will make again.",

The brownie layer is VERY thin, and is very soft. It didn't \"set\" up nicely, as I had expected. Second, after you add the marshmallows, you need to really watch it. Mine puffed up, and then totally deflated while cooling, into a layer of marshmallow goo! I think you really need to take them out when the marshmallows are still holding their shape, and not puffed. I think these would have been much better had that layer help up better.",
