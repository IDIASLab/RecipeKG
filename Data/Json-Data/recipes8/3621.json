Froze up a cup to a cup & a 1/4th in individual baggies and waited;-) Had to make my own drink mix with unsweetened drink mix and sugar and followed the recipe like stated. I ended up adding a TBSP more because I believe the pre-made stuff is more concentrated then mine...but however it took all of a couple of minutes to pull things to one stop and whip in a matter of seconds...TY TY TY this was the best now I can make it with a moments notice on the fly!

It is as thick as a slurpy. I will have to post it some time. The flavor of this was decent though and I liked the calorie count. Just a bit too much water texture wise for my taste.",
