I used boneless skinless chicken breasts to cut out the fat so to compensate I marinated the chicken in lemon juice for several hours and added a few tbs of water to the bottom of the pan so the mushrooms wouldn't dry out. I also spread each chicken breast with about 1/4 tsp chicken base for extra flavor. During the last 8-10 minutes I added some zucchini chunks and tossed with the mushrooms and onions. The result - a complete meal right out of the oven! Next time I think I'll try using fresh garlic cloves instead of the powder. Thanks for a great recipe!",

I did not change any of the ingredients, however I did alter the prep to make this dish more flavorful. First I season the bottom of the thighs. Then I place them skin side up in the dish and peel back the skin completely but  leaving it attached along one edge. Then I season the bare meat with the spices and lemon juice. Replace the skin into its original position, drizzle each piece with a little olive oil and massage into the skin with your fingers. Bake at 375 for 1 hour and you won't have to mess with turning or broiling - just walk away. Your skin will be nicely crispy and the chicken will be moist and tasty!",
