Real butter is usually my go to ingredient, but, I was really impressed by how easy and flavorful the spread  itself was. The texture of the cornbread was perfect for my taste it lacked a little taste. I think because it was a little too sweet and drowned out the other flavors. I think I would try with no sugar next time or very little sugar but the product itself was on spot. Thank you",

I do wish it was a touch sweeter (I like a sweeter cornbread, though),  but it was delicious with the honey butter that the recipe submitter recommended. I think adding some spice to it would be fantastic as well! Maybe in the form of cayenne, red pepper flakes, chili powder, or even diced jalapenos. Oh, and the recipe states to grease and flour an 8x8 pan, but I simply lined it with parchment paper--that worked perfectly, and made for easy cleanup! Thank you for the recipe!",
