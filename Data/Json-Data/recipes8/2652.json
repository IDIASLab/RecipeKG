Instead of a Tablespoon of mustard use a Teaspoon of dry mustard instead. the dry mustard will help absorb some of the moisture from the lemon juice and the yougurt.",

And I found it to be quite tangy between the yogurt, lemon juice, and mustard----usually I enjoy that, but it was bit much for me here. I would recommend starting off with less amounts of mustard and lemon juice, and adjust to your own taste from there. I also am not sure why you'd want to discard one of the yolks? There's no need to waste that--so definitely include it in the egg salad too. Overall, it wasn't a bad sandwich, but I don't know that I would make it again. It was certainly worth a try though--so thank you for the recipe!",
