        "description": "If you're ever pressed for time, start with a couple cans of tuna and you'll have a delicious patty in no time that you can serve a number of different ways. Add them to buns with your favorite toppings for sandwiches, serve them alongside a fresh salad, or make smaller versions of them and serve them as appetizers with tartar sauce on the side. There are a lot of great flavor elements in these easy and versatile patties, but the quantities are small so the flavor still comes out pretty mild. If you're looking for a stronger flavor, increase quantities as you like!",
