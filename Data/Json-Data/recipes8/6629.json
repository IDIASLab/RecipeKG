Also used Lawry's Seasoned Pepper in the flour mixture and put more on the surface before baking.  I think this gave it more of the flavor that some reviewers were missing.  All in all, a wonderful recipe and I'm so glad I found it!!!\n(Most of us \"tweak\" everything a bit......doesn't mean the original wouldn't have been great, too.)",

I corrected this by using Penzey's lamb seasoning in addition to the salt and pepper.

I think the flour could also be omitted--it made a weird hard crust that seems unnecessary. Thanks for a great idea to get me started!",

I laid the roast in the pan with the stuffing cut to one side, fat cap up.  Then I oiled the parchment and with the help of the foil--parchment side pressed firmly against the stuffing and meat--molded a shield around the entire exposed cut, which kept the stuffing in pretty effectively without interfering with the roasting process.  Viola!  No leaky stuffing and a lovely, browned roast.\n\nI also cut down the size of this recipe considerably.  Usually, I buy a full, $70 leg of lamb.  I cut up some for stew or tajines, cut big chunks for kabobs, and leave the meat under the fat cap for a stuffed, butterflied roast like this one.  That leaves me a nice bone to roast for broth and a decent amount of scrap meat for stuffed grape leaves.  The only thing that gets thrown out unused is some silver skin.  That overpriced leg of lamb becomes a much more economical cut.  For this cut-down roast, you can use a 4 oz roll of goat cheese and just eyeball the rest.  It should serve 4-6 people generously.  I also roast it on top of halved baby new potatoes tossed with olive oil.  Scrumptious!",
