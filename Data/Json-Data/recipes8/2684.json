As good if not better than any I've ever had at authentic Mexican restaurants - and I consider myself an enchilada connoisseur.  I used half of a large poblano chile pepper which are very mild in flavor and heat.  You will not need a full 1/2 pint of cream.  A lot of it went to waste.  I had much more than 2-1/2 cups of liquid in the end so I measured 2 cups for the bottom of the 9/13 pan and dumped the rest.  For me, the recipe made 9  enchiladas, stuffed to the hilt.  My husband called me at work today to tell me how good even the leftovers were and asked how soon could we make these again.  Thanks Gerry for a definite keeper.",

I marinated the chicken in a fajita sauce (powder packet), and it tasted great.  Spicy enough to satisfy the boyfriend, and mild enough so that I could eat it.  My boyfriend hates tomatoes, so I processed the tomato/chile mixture, and that worked out great.  What I do is boil the chicken for 15-20 minutes, then shred it with two forks, then I pour in the fajita seasoning with water, leave for several minutes, the pour out the excess.  Then I follow with the mixing (no cooking, just baking).  THANKS GERRY!",

After removing the chicken I chopped it up and had plenty of the stewing liquid which I blended with my immersible blender and used this for the sauce.(It is just that good!)I did reduce it some. I also microwaved the tortillas so I didn't need the cream. I also left out the can of enchilada sauce and the chicken broth. With the few changes this recipe can be made often and in little time. This is definitely a favorite. Thanks for sharing Gerry!",

She proclaimed that these were the best chicken enchiladas she has ever tasted. They make rather large enchiladas so there were plenty of left over. I sent some over to my mother and she called back the next day saying they were great and that she had already ate them all up. I substitued a small can of mild green chiles instead of the optional fresh chiles and still got plenty of chile flavoring. A food processor would have helped with shredding up the chicken. These are truly Chicken Enchiladas of the Gods!! Thanks Gerry:)",
