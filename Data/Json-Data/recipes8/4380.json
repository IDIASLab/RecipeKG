As not in my favor when getting the simple ingredients for this recipe at this time of year....shelves were empty. SO subbing Cheddar Bugles for the regular and the Duo Cheez-It's for the plain...are the adjustments I had to make...not by choice. But it still worked. I could say this could use some salt or garlic powder added at the end would be really good not much but just a little. And knowing how well this recipe worked and the family liked it I think personally using cheddar bugles I would reserve the cheddar bugles(or put aside) follow through the rest of the recipes as written and add the cheddar bugles after words to get that cheesy flavor. But again good recipe good flavor.",
