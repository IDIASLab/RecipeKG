As  a child growing up on a hard-scrabble 160 acre homestead farm and beginning marriage during the depths of the Great Depression, she learned early to \"waste not.\" She died in 2008 at age 95. Her chocolate cake with clabbered milk was one of her ways of using up everything. No raisins in her cake and she was a little heavier on the cocoa. She also added a small amount of red food color to make it darker. The daughters-in-law and granddaughters have tried to match Mom but they just can't quite emulate her magic. In her later years she added a simple powdered sugar frosting as a finishing touch. I commented once that I never remembered her putting frosting on the cake when I was growing up. In those years she was cooking for a husband and two growing sons, so she explained it quite simply, \"They never lasted that long.\" Thanks for triggering a great memory. Galen",

I did make substitutions I used the Splenda substitute generic for sugar and I probably used a cup and a half instead of three-quarters of a cup. I used a bundt cake pan because it was all I had. I had no fruit to add or nuts. It was very very moist oh, oh yeah I had some almond flour that I wanted to use so I mixed it with the regular all-purpose flour. So it was so moist at first I thought it was not done all the way through but it was. I cooked it the 35 minutes. Then I sliced it in small portions and I'm freezing at the cause if I don't oh, we will eat the whole thing within 2 days and I tried to live on a very portion control intake. I recommend it. By the way tomorrow when I have my slice I will put a tablespoon of my sugar-free instant chocolate pudding on top just so I can feel like I had some chocolate cake with icing!
