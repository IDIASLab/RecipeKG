It came out perfectly.\nI thought it might be too wet due to the amount of apples but it has a nice moistness. It's fairly quick to make, especially because I use my KitchenAid apple peeler/slicer attachment to do the apples, then chop them. I served it with whipped cream only, no caramel sauce as I don't like that much extra sugar and the cake is plenty sweet enough on its own. It was a big hit with all of us, including the picky 6 year old who \"doesn't like apples\". He like these apples!",
