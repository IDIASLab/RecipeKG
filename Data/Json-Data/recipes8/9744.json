This is incredible, and the Sriracha and mayo combo and the dipping sauce top it off perfectly. So glad I made them to go with it! Also, if I had a dollar for every time my hubby said, \"That was really good,\" or, \"I really liked that,\" or something to that effect, I'd have enough dollars to fill my car up with gas. Thanks for the recipe. Absolutely amazing!",
