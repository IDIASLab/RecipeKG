One hubby took some\r\nhome to his wife and she wants the recipe now.\r\nMixing up the batter when you're ready to bake is really quick, but I had to\r\ngive it a 3 in \"Quickness Rating\" because of the obvious fruit making time.\r\nThe process gives parents a chance to teach about chemical reaction and how\r\nthe sugar is used as \"energy\" teaching wise.",

My dad has talked about this cake for years (his grandmother use to make it) so I am trying to make him one. I'm so sad that my first attempt was ruined and I have no idea what went wrong.

I also put a used bean can in the middle of an 8\" spring form pan after baking it is much easier to serve and using 3 cups batter instead of 4 (so I can create more little ones to share).
