        "description": "This is Persian green stew. I titled this 'Not Quite Ghormeh Sabzi' because I'm not quite Persian, but I grew up with a Persian step-father who would cook the most awesome Ghormeh Sabzi. My understanding is that Ghormeh Sabzi literally means 'green stew' in Farsi but since many of my Persian friends have taken delight in teaching me to say the wrong thing, don't take my word for it. Every Persian I know makes this slightly differently, so the version here is a mix of several recipes, based largely on what I could get at any major grocery store. It's not traditional, but it's so good. Serve over white rice.",

The main difference is that there are no potatoes in ghormeh sabzi and also the major herb is Fenugreek which is very aromatic and should be used moderately. It also has leek in it and the herbs are all chopped and should be stir fried in a small amount of oil. This stew has a lot of green herbs in it so that's why the result should be completely green I have also attached a picture for ghormeh sabzi.",

I just wanted to comment that this stew is immensely popular among Iranians who eat herbs (\"sabzi\") in large quantities the way Westerners eat vegetables. When I lived in Iran I saw street vendors commonly selling bunches of fresh herbs out of wheel barrels. I also saw my Iranian neighbor wash and prepare two eighty-kilogram burlap sacks filled with herbs to put in the freezer for making this recipe over the winter (she would be making it many times over obviously). I never actually liked \"Ghormeh Sabzi\" myself because I always found it bitter. I made some for my Iranian-born husband for his new year (Norooz) a month ago and it was the first \"Ghormeh Sabzi\" I ever liked. I had left out the cilantro because I didn't have any and learned from my husband that it is the cilantro that gives it the bitter taste. My husband complained a lot: He definitely wants cilantro in his \"Ghormeh Sabzi\"! I think we need \"his and hers\" \"Ghormeh Sabzi\" at our home! If you are serving this dish to an Iranian be sure to serve it with steamed BASMATI rice. This dish could easily be adapted to be a vegetarian (vegan) dish since a lot of the flavor comes from the herbs and lime juice. Thank you Jedigeek for sharing your recipe. It is a lovely tribute to your stepfather.",

I also cut down the amount of broth in the recipe to 3 cups (I may even cut it down further to 2.5 cups) and dialed back the lime juice to 2/3 cup.
