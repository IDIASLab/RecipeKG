Instead of mushroom/onion/cheddar stuffing I've always used thinly sliced Italian salami thinly sliced provolone cheese and a couple of sliced hard-boild eggs. It is just very wonderful as is but often I will make it and roast it in the oven then plunk it into my homemade spaghetti sauce for about 15 minutes or so and serve it instead of meatballs with spaghetti. My mom always made this and it was considered \"company meatloaf\" named in Italian \"Polpetone\". which translates literally to big meat ball! It really is an Italian favorite with \"Sunday gravy\" when the whole family and some friends gather.",
