                "reviewBody": "7.6.19 I took a crepe course a number of years ago I ve tried quite a few crepe recipes since then and never have I seen one where the flour and milk are equal. Typically you let the crepe batter rest for 20 minutes. This recipe doesn t instruct you to do so but I did. Crepe batter needs to be fairly thin and I found this batter just too thick. I added a little milk to thin it down a bit but still wanted to stay true to the recipe as written. The recipe doesn t even tell you what size pan to use even an approximate size. But 2 tablespoons of this batter wasn t enough to cover even a 6 skillet. The standard measurement for recipes that I ve made is about 1/4 cup of batter. I threw away the first two crepes added more batter but still less than a quarter cup and at least I had enough batter to cover the bottom of the pan. I could taste no chocolate and the texture of the crepe unfortunately was rubbery. Also equal amounts of sour cream and cream cheese didn t work for us as the sour cream just dominated waaaaay too tangy for a sweet crepe. Sorry for the less than favorable first review but honestly this recipe was a big disappointment. And that comment is not meant to discourage others from trying since we all have different tastes. It just didn t work for me.",
