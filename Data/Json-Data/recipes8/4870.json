And keep in mind...the 2 tbs of pepper is fresh ground pepper from a pepper grinder so there's a bit less spice than buying it already ground from the store. However the salt is absorbed by the sausage pretty well and only adding a little usually wasn't enough for my wife and I. So I guess \"salt and pepper to taste.\" Still love making this dish!

I love to cook so I tend to use recipes as a guide. (I would like to use the exact recipe if I'm going to post a review but I'm Cajun so I like to do the season/sniff/taste method of cooking.) Only adjustments I suggest are grilling the sausage to compliment the cremini mushrooms and using a more flavourful cheese like an Italian blend. Family has already asked me to make it again:)",

I used it as a base but reduced most of the spices to a teaspoon (instead of a tablespoon) and it was still deliciously strong. I also used twice the mushrooms and a whole (small) red onions. I also used a little roux to thicken up the sauce after reducing it to a good amount. It came out really delicious. I will definitely make it again.
