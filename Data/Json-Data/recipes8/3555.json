We love strawberry shortcake so this was appealing, and given peaches are in season, it was a good use of the fresh fruit. We were not crazy about the biscuits as they seemed rather gummy to us. The peach compote was perfectly sweet and could stand on its own. My husband asked me to make my regular biscuits next time.",
