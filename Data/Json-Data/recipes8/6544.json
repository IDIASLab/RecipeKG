Due to poor planning on my part I only ended up marinating the chicken about 30 minutes but even so it had plenty of flavor. Very fresh summery flavors that are sure to impress your guests. I used a bottled balsamic glaze (instead of making it per the recipe) because I had some on hand. I ended up cooking the chicken about 20 mins because they were rather large pieces and it came out SO juicy! I also used fresh mozzarella.",

The balsamic reduction definitely added some great additional flavors to the dish!!",
