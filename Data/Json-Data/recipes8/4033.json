My toddler was diagnosed with Celiac's recently, and I'd rather prepare her food from scratch, instead of buying processed, over priced, gluten free snacks in the grocery store. Many of the recipes I'm trying take a little practice, but I'll figure it out. \nEven though the muffins did not turn out as planned, they smell amazing!",

Tip: If you try different flours you might need to add more milk or water to it as some flours are more absorbent than others. Once you know the right consistency you can play around the recipe quite a lot like add shredded carrots or zucchini nuts or substitute mashed banana for the apple sauce etc.",
