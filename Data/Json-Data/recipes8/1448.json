Texture is more like a cake rather than quick bread but that s OK with me because it s delicious. It s tasty chocolatey and tender and I wouldn t change a thing. As a side note I think this would be good with some chopped walnuts added and a dusting of confectioners sugar. Thanks for sharing this is a keeper.",
