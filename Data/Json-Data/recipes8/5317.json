It is a nice alternative to oatmeal if you want to avoid milk. You can substitute butter for coconut oil use different types of fruit: apples, peaches, plums, or nectarines, peeled or unpeeled. Add apple juice if oats are not yet complete and mixture begins to dry out.",

I adjust the honey depending on the sweetness of the fruit. And I ll switch out the cinnamon for other seasonings such as lemon zest with the blueberries. I don t mix the nuts in when cooking but have them available as an optional topping. We serve it in bowls and pour milk over it like a hot cereal. Sometimes we ll splurge and top it with lightly sweetened whipped cream. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!",
