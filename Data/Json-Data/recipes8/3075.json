I had leftover steak and onions from another recipe so it worked out perfectly. This is a good recipe. Basic but good. The one important thing to know is that whichever meat you use it HAS to be seasoned first. If you just boil a chicken breast in water and chop it up to use for this you will be very disappointed. I prefer using grilled chicken or steak that has been marinated in Sazon  and Corona but any of your favorites will work.",
