I made exactly as written but I think it needs a little more horseradish as its presence in the dish was very subtle- which If you are serving those that are leery of horseradish This might be the way to go!l Or Maybe sub a TBLS or 2 of horseradish Mayo? Give the added zing and flair that I love about horseradish without making your nose tingle! Again; everyone I served to really liked - I just want more kick. Served on croissants and the next day With crackers - it makes a lot!  Thanks for the recipe!",
