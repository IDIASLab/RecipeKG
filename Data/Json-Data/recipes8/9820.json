                "reviewBody": "I made half of this recipe so it yielded a small 6\" cake. It was very good as is. I did however add 1/8 tsp of baking soda and 1/4 tsp of baking powder. It came out fantastic. My only qualm is that my apples sunk but still sprinkling the toasted almonds made up for it. I personally think that almost must be toasted to create the contrasting flavor and enhance it. There is something special about the blending of toasted almond with the apples and the cake itself. WILL ABSOLUTELY MAKE IT AGAIN! Suggestion for baking: cover the top if it starts browning too quickly. Also, regardless of size you may need to still bake it up to the full 50-55 minutes.",

I made sure all of the butter was at room temperature and followed all ingredients to a T (other than using Granny Smith apples because that\u2019s what I had on hand - but I\u2019m sure almost any type of apples would work out just fine!) I used Pam nonstick spray (the one with flour already in it for baking) and did need to increase baking time a bit to achieve more of a golden color on top and to make sure cake was cooked through. Such an attractive cake and it was a huge hit with my guests! I\u2019ve already been asked for the recipe!",
