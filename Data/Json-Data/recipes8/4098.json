The grapeseed or vegetable oil is actually unhealthy for you, creating inflammation that brings on the diseases that Keto prevents.  Otherwise, these are perfect for the Keto diet, with the low-carb, high protein cheese, the grain-free flours to coat them in, the protein in the eggs, as well.  A good coconut oil is able to withstand the higher heat to fry in (up to 450 degrees F), without imparting any flavor to the frying, but with lots of MCT oil benefits.",

I did not have any issues with some exploding, just a little leakage which was most likely because I didn't have actual cheese curds on hand. I used shredded Oaxacan cheese instead, which I pressed firmly into the shape of a cheese curd. Still worked great :-) my husband said these were the best cheese curds he ever had and he is not gluten-free.",
