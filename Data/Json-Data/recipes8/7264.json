I omitted the French onion soup and used 1 pkg of dry onion soup mix, along with 1 can of beef broth like the other reviewers suggested.  I also only used 1 cup of water.  It turned out better than I expected.  The meat was tender, and I liked the fact that I didn't have to brown it first.  The only thing I would say is that it does need some extra seasoning, maybe next time I will tweak it and add some extra spices to it.  Overall good recipe, nice and quick prep, took the whole 5 hours to cook.  Update:  I make this all the time.  I have a large family so I still double the recipe.  I don't use the french onion soup at all.  I use 2 cans mushroom soup, 1 pkg onion soup mix, and 1 cup low sodium beef broth, no additional water - I think that is what makes it bland.  Extra seasonings I add are pepper, Maggi, and Worcestershire sauce.  I also add an onion (but we really like onions!).  Turns out tasty for me every time.  I sometimes cook this on 300 for 4 hours to save time, although it is better to cook it as the original recipe states.",

I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and added 1 10.75 oz can beef broth, 1 cup water, 1 package dry onion soup mix, instead of the water and french onion soup that is called for.  I also put this in a crock pot on high for 4 hours.  I doubled all of the vegetables, and added almost a full 10.75 oz can of corn (did I mention that we really love our veggies!).  At the end, it was still soupy, so I thickened it up with 2 Tablespoons of corn starch which made it perfect.  With the changes that were made, I give this a full 4 stars for taste and ease of preparation -it is the simplest dish you could make.  I will be making this again soon!",
