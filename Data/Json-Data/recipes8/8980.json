For a 12 lb bird (breast side down)I used a Brinkman Smoke-n-Grill charcoal 2 layer smoker (w/seperate water pan) and soaked hickory chips. No tin foil tenting required! I used 2t dry (vice 2T fresh) spices and did not soak in brine. I let rub sit overnight and got under the skin too! I filled the cavity with celery, carrots, apple and orange qrtrs, discarded when done. I allowed 30-40 mins per lb for cooking, flipping the bird (lol) after 3-4 hours breast side up, adding charcoal as needed. No burning, moist! For bigger birds I recommend using an o/nite brine soak and an indirect heat (barrell type smoker w/seperate fire box) charcoal smoker (~$88 on sale) with a coffee can of water, applejuice, wine, beer whatever! Being my 1st smoked bird, I have nothing to compare it to, soo the **** rating... Try this now!  :)",
