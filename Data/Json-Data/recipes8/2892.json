I didn't warm the chicken in the microwave and made these into wrap sandwiches with flour tortillas vs. making these into tacos. I used pico de gallo vs. salsa and \"Taco Seasoning II\" from this site vs. a packaged seasoning mix.  I left out the olives and instead thought what works best with ranch, lettuce and tomato - Bacon of course! So I added a few slices of bacon to each wrap along with the avocado slices and shredded cheddar cheese - YUM!",

I didn't use rotisserie chicken, either. I had two chicken breasts I boiled in chicken broth with mexican spices (cumin, coriander, onion, garlic, mexican oregano), then cooled and shredded. I also used flour tortillas. This was quite good--easy and a kid pleaser. I think that next time, I'd skip the tortillas and try this as a chunky chicken taco salad.",
