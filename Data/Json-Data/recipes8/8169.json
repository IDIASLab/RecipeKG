Perfect for a cool weather weeknight dinner! Also great for those looking to cut back on meat consumption. Mushrooms are a good source of protein, though if you are a meat lover, ground turkey would be a nice addition.",

I used short grain rice, vegetable broth and instead of a bay leaf, used thyme and rosemary along with pepper, garlic and a pinch of salt.  I used the carrots and celery as stated.  There was enough here for two meals, with a little extra celery, carrots, mushrooms and broth added the second day.",
