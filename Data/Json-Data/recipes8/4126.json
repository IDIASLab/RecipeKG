I wish someone else had so I would not have wasted ingredients and time on it. It had no flavor, not sweet at all, and the texture of pizza dough and the flavor of biscuits when I tried to mix it. I used baking gluten free flour that I have used for cookies, but not cakes so that could have been part of it. But even if the super dense finished texture was not- ideal the fact the flavor was really lacking,so bad that even chocolate buttercream frosting did not rescue it was still an issue. I have never thrown out a cake- but I did this one. Look for other recipes to try before this one...",
