Also all I had on hand was shredded cheddar cheese so I went with that. I thought the amount of mayo was not gonna be enough but I followed the recipe anyway and it turned out perfectly creamy and delicious! I prepared this the night before so that I could just bake it when I was ready and that worked out very well. My oven is super hot so it only took about 25 mins. to bake. I served it with 'slow cooker ham' fron this site which was a perfect match. This was a BIG hit with my family and I will be making this again and again! Thanks for sharing!:)",
