Keep reading I expect this to be helpful.;) I had old sweetened condensed milk to use. It had darkened a bit & lost its smooth thick texture & gotten like melted mozzarella. 'Didn't let that stop me.:D I made a different recipe for pie - with two blocks of cream cheese without heavy cream. It still had ribbons when cutting; didn't firm up. 'Scooped it from the pie crust & folded in 8oz 3c Cool Whip; then folded in the crust. Good but - here's the lesson - 3c Cool Whip was too much - too much as in too light & too much for the amount of crust - so I'm pretty sure 2c heavy cream 4c whipped would be too much. I'm thinking ingredient should read \"2 cups whipped cream\". As I did 3 cups whipped I had two pies' worth of filling & one crust. Does that make sense to anyone? Anyone?!:o:)... 1c heavy = 2c whipped.",
