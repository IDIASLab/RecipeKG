Other than that I made the recipe almost exactly as it said including the cinnamon...the only substitution I had to make was to use apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar b/c I didn't have any when the time came to prepare this. The other comment I would make about this recipe is that it took longer for me to prepare than the recipe time said. 10 minutes for the bacon 5 minutes for the apples/onions 30 minutes for the chicken (I had to fry it in 3 separate batches) 8 minutes for the cabbage to soften then another 10 minutes for the last step before the oven. That right there is just over an hour. Since I was trying to make this before my husband went to work I turned the oven up to 380 degrees and baked it for 30 minutes...maybe that's why the chicken wasn't super crispy? Anyway there's that. I'll definitely make this again the next time I receive a red cabbage head in my CSA box!",

To be fair, I lived in Frankfurt and my husband is born and raised Hamburgian, so I saw the red flag with the brown sugar ingredient, but I tried it anyway. American style brown sugar isn't easily available in Germany. The recipe as instructed is just too sweet. I had three large chicken breasts, which were very dried out after baking on top of the cabbage. To be more authentic, it needs more red-wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar and cloves. There wasn't enough liquid. The seasoning on the chicken wasn't sufficient. Overall, bland, too sweet,  unsavory and not representative of any  dish I'd ever enjoyed in Germany.",
