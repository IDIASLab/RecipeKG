It's really really good and really easy to make! most ingredients you would have in the house except maybe the fruit. It cooks up beautifully with a nice crust and I would consider this more of a cobbler type recipe than a cake. During the summer we have access to beautiful marion berries which will be wonderful with this recipe! I highly recommend this have posted photos on FB and given the recipe out to several people already! It's going to be a staple dessert in my house!",
