I ground my own almonds and that may have lent a coarser texture, but it was delicious. I tried to chop them up a little bit in my food processor, but it didn't really work! Either way, delicious! Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter, and the measurements in grams were super helpful because I always use a scale when baking. Thanks for this deliciously different recipe!",
