Even as a kid, I've always loved soup. Then we moved out of state. Even though it has been nearly 40 years since I last had it, I never forgot about their beef and cabbage soup. I decided to recreate it based off my memory and here is what I came up with. Enjoy!",

If I have, I'm certain that I've never had the hamburger cabbage stew.  It sounds good though so I made some today.  About half way through the 30-minute summer I gave it a taste.   Needed more salt but I didn't add any while cooking.  Whoever wants to can add to their preference once it's in their bowl.  I used about 1/4 tsp of Lowery's seasoned salt in mine. \nWhile taking that mid-simmer taste it occurred to me that it was crying out for pasta!  Of course! \nI added 1 cup of spaghetti pasta, broken into ~2-inch pieces when there was 11 minutes to go.  Also tossed in 1 teaspoonful of oregano. \nHaving never eaten the stuff at Shoney's, I have no basis for comparison.  On its own though, it wasn't bad.  I might cook it again some time but will experiment some, like maybe some tomato paste and carrots.  Okra could be good too.  Or maybe zucchini.",
