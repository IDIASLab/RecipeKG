I removed the skin from the chicken thighs which is what we prefer and I seasoned it with salt and pepper on each side while sauteing. Used 2 packages of thighs which gave me 8 pieces. Otherwise followed as written. You can sub any kind of pasta you've got in the pantry. Really good!",

Used penne pasta and served this with some crusty french bread. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!",

Breading the chicken and just browning it putting it back in with the sauce to cook made it so tender it melted in your mouth. Oh...I also didn't have but half the mushrooms on hand but still was fabulous. If I'd had the extra mushrooms I would've used them cause I love them. I prepped the veggies and put them in bowls prior to cooking because I had errands to run. It cut down on putting it all together at once. If it hadn't been my day off I would've prepped the veggies in the a.m. and left the cooking for when I got home. Still needs about an hour to cook it all. Worth the wait. I'm keeping this in my recipe box!!",
