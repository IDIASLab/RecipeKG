No sooner did Hubs down his (and it was quickly too) and he wanted more. And so did I. I did press it through a wire mesh strainer as it was just a little too pulpy for me (maybe it's just my blender) but I followed the recipe for everything else including the fresh mint lime and the amount of sugar which we both found to be the perfect amount. So we had more - and Hubs requested that from now on I make this with Splenda which indicates he plans on drinking a lot of this! Thanks for sharing this delightful treat SB - we couldn't have enjoyed it more.",

Not that my two cents matters (remember I wasn't fond of this...) but I do think the amount of sugar is a tad too much (start with less and add the suggested amount if you still feel the need to). I also think running your mixture through a strainer would be wise (my drink was a little too pulpy for my liking - and I have a VERY powerful KitchenAid blender!!!). Maybe this will float your boat but it just didn't mine. Thanks SB!:-)",
