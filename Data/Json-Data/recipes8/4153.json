I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk added or not. One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets. These are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.",

Using the parmigiana and bechamel in the recipe created a very light creamy feel to it that is so different than using ricotta and mozzarella! We loved the bolognese sauce it is so flavorful and delicious! Yes I did make the pasta noodles and yes it is true that I am a mere novice and this was the first time I added spinach to a pasta. It was harder for me than I expected but I just worked the dough until it was the elasticity I am familiar with adding flour as I went. In the end I made a presentable pasta next time around I might make them ahead of time. This is a labor of love and the end product delivered!",
