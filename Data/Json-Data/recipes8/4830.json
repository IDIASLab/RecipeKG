To the reviewer who needed to add cornstarch to the \"sauce \" note that the recipe states to let the wine \"nearly evaporate.\" No sauce with this dish. I rubbed olive oil into the mushrooms (both sides) prior to grilling. I didn't have shallots onhand so used half a large vidalia onion and added garlic like other reviewers. Paired nicely with grilled Steelhead Trout from this site. Thanks RCOWGILL!",
