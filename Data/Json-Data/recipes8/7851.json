It's creamy, chocolaty, and makes the right amount to cover the cake without overwhelming it. Everyone loved it. Reading another review:  I cannot believe that someone would find this frosting \"sickeningly sweet.\" Like, have you had frosting before? It's supposed to be sweet. And this one is most definitely not \"sickening.\" It has less powdered sugar than most other frosting recipes out there, and has a predominate chocolate flavor. You must simply not like frosting. Anyway, I made this as written, and would not change a thing. It's a great dark chocolate cake.",

I did bake the cake in a 10 x 14 brownie style pan so it needed to bake for an extra 10 to 15 minutes (just until it wasn't giggling in the center) and it was superb.
