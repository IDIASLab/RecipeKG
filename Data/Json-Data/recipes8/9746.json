Used a 10\" cast iron skillet and returned the cooked chops to the sauteed tomato-olive mixture to simmer a bit in the juices before serving.  Delicious!  I think I'll make this again using boneless chicken breasts as hubby is not a fan of pork products , although he cleaned his plate with only a little grumbling.",

I did not hs have cherry tomatoes so cut up a tomato I had and gently squeezed to remove excess moisture. Needed to cut the cooking time down to half for the tomatoes. Followed the rest exactly. Very good. The pork chops were done but still tender. Flavor was great.",
