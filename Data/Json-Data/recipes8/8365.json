The only adjustments I made was to halve the recipe (since it's just hubby and me), added a pinch of red pepper flakes to the gravy, and made the entire thing in my cast iron. I absolutely love the combination of savory sausage, the sweet-tart cranberries, the creamy gravy, and the bit of heat from the red pepper--it's unexpected, and delicious! Plus: it's a gorgeous dish! Thanks so much for the recipe!",

My gravy thickened up really fast so next time I might try turning the heat down or adding a little more milk to thin it out. The flavor from the sausage was DELICIOUS! Will make again!",
