Wrong kind of cheese for me, I like cheese in Enchiladas that is melted & very runny. The cheddar doesn't melt good enough. The processed cheese: I took it to mean Velveeta. Here is what I would do if I made this again. I would put the Velveeta on the inside of them & put the cheddar on the outside of them. I did sprinkle a little on after I got out of oven, because the Velveeta had kinda dried in place & didn't look good. I would also add some cayenne & jalapenos for more flavor. I would cook it longer also (covered with a lid to hold the moisture). But, it was just OK for me.",

I used what I had on hand, so I substituted flour tortillas for the corn, I had a partial jar of a medium queso cheese dip that I needed to use up, so I used it instead of the processed cheese and I skipped the onion completely as it was in my homemade chili.  I warmed the flour tortillas in the micro, filled them  with cheddar cheese, rolled as the recipe states and topped w/ the chili cheese sauce.  Baked as directed.  My husband and I both thought this was very good.  I topped the enchiladas with sour cream and a medium salsa.  I'll definitely make this again, but will be sure to have corn tortillas on hand when I do as I think they would lend a more authentic mexican flavor to the dish.",

Also, I grated the onion, and squeezed the excess moisture out using a tea towel, and topped the enchiladas with that and the remaining half of the cheddar cheese.

                "reviewBody": "The one right thing in this recipe are the corn tortillas.  I could agree with the use of chili to top the enchiladas if it was homemade, this would make it Tex-Mex.  However, the use of Velveeta is not a traditional Mexican ingredient.  Tex-Mex can sometimes use this recipe but most people I know find it objectionable.  I live in Texas so I can safely say what is Tex-Mex.  It is not necessary to use canned and processed foods when our Mexican family proves that it is not hard to make these another way.  I make my own enchilada sauce and my own chili.  They are both so easy to make from scratch and I believe healthier.  We use a finely grated Longhorn or Mexican cheese mix for our enchiladas.  For an easy chili, just chop some onion, celery, and bell pepper.  Use about 3 to 4 tablespoons of a mild chili powder (guests can add hot sauce to their taste.)  Use cumin and oregano, tomato juice or V8 (1 cup) or combo of such with a can of tomato sauce (10 oz. can), and I use Better Than  Bouillon chicken broth to taste (2 cups).  I brown my ground beef (3 lbs.), drain, then add it last to finish cooking.  For maximum flavor, I pressure cook for 3 minutes but it is not necessary.  Easy.   When I make chili Colorado, I use the beef cut for beef stew or cut up left over roast and the rest of the ingredients are pretty much the same.  Easy.",
