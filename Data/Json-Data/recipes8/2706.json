First I used one can of low sodium/low fat chicken broth plus three cubes (plus water) of boullion. Second I used fresh tomatoes I had quartered and frozen plus one small can tomato sauce. I only had one can corn and I used ground turkey. The spices I kept the same which is the important part. Lastly I had no cornstarch so thickening the soup was not done and I used corn tortilla chips since that's all that I had. Thanks for sharing!",

I live alone but made a full recipe to have for lunches this week and to freeze for future meals. This time I made it with beef broth doubled the meat and only put it 1 can of corn. I also used shredded cheddar instead of American and used broken-up blue corn tortilla chips and chopped avocado as the garnishes. These garnishes really make the dish complete! Sour cream would be great too. This is a great meal as it has a good amount of spice. There isn't much of a difference when using beef stock compared to chicken stock. The first one is just more \"beefy \" obviously! The cream corn is a nice touch. Finally if I were going to recommend any alterations to the recipe I'd say to DEFINITELY double the meat. I added in just over a pound and I think anything less would have been too little. Thanks for sharing! Enjoy everyone!",

Only 3 people in my house so I adjusted the ingredients for 4 servings and had leftovers for 2 days at work. Soup only gets better.
