I cut the recipe in 1/2 and added about 1/4 cup of crumbly blue cheese as well. I have also used the canned chicken breast as a quick & easy substitute - comes out great. I used a 12.5 oz can on the 1/2 recipe. I've made it for 2 parties and guest have completely devoured both times.",

For me it was overwhelming BUT I'm giving it 5 stars on his behalf as he said it was his favorite and he thought the blue cheese taste was perfect in it. Next time I'll make it half and half omitting that out of mine and putting it all in his.:D Thanks for the recipe!",
