There's one thing I like to do different: I do like my cilantro/chili/garlic mix to \"fry\" and not just to simmer. The flavor (AND aroma!) that the chili pepper, the garlic and the cilantro release when being fried is IMO much better than the one they release when being simmered. So I omit the liquids in this step and add them later, and instead I add some oil to the blender (otherwise the herbs, garlic and peppers won't blend well) and then pour the mix into the hot pot and that will cause it to \"fry\". I also sautee the onions in the same pot, right after the cilantro/garlic/chili has been frying for a few minutes. Everything else is the same. **note**: Be VERY careful when deveining and deseeding the chili peppers. I do it with a knife and spoon and try not to touch the inside of the pepper until it's perfectly clean. Otherwise my hands will burn and so will everything I touch. Also, be ready to cough a bit, as the smell of the spicy part of the pepper you're removing will release some vapor that will make you cough. You can always buy the chili paste in a jar, but I warn you, that one will be hot.",

If you do it this way remember to simmer the cilantro-orange-garlic mixture in the dutch oven after frying the chicken (while sauteeing the onions and rice in the other skillet).

I used beer instead of orange juice. Also per some other recipes I left the thighs for a couple of hours after patting with lemon juice salt pepper and cumin. Tomorrow I'm using the recipe for arroz con pato (duck) and will use the orange juice in it.",
