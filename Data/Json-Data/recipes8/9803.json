        "description": "Unlike many other oatmeal cookie recipes with refined sugars and flours, you won't find any of that nonsense here. Just old-fashioned oats, maple syrup, and loads of fiber. Oh yeah, and dark chocolate chips, which by the way are little antioxidant powerhouses. Scrumptious and entirely guilt free! Adding brewer's yeast to this recipe makes for a great, nutrient-dense lactation cookie for new, nursing moms. Omit for a more classic oatmeal cookie. Store in an airtight container at room temperature, or freeze.",
