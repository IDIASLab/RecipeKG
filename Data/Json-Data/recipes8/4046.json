The crisp of the cookie is satisfying and goes well with a nice cup of tea at the end of a long day. I have used the end of a bag of trail mix to make them before and it worked out perfectly.

                "reviewBody": "The flavour of these cookies is nice, but the recipe simply didn't work out for me. I used Best All-Purpose Gluten-Free Flour Blend from this website. I ended up adding two more Tbsp of tapioca flour because the \"dough\" (actually a batter) was so liquid. I feel there is something missing here. It definitely needs less liquid or more flour and I feel there is simply too much sugar for the amounts of the other ingredients. I used a medium egg at room temp. I even used powdered vanilla instead of liquid. I put the mixture in the fridge for 10 minutes but still, it spread out so much on the baking sheet that it became one big, flat bar instead of 12 cookies. It also stuck to my lightly greased parchment paper and didn't cook thoroughly even though I left it in the oven for almost 15 minutes. I waited 10 minutes before even attempting to cut them into single servings. They never crisped. They taste good. I think more flour and less sugar would aid here. Thank you Michelle2s for your recipe.",

The flavor was pretty good, but like the previous review-exactly- my 'batter' spread over the entire pan into one big thin pancake. I baked them for a few additional minutes to make them cookie-like, they became like a brittle. I like experimenting with ingredients I have on hand so this  wasnt too difficult. However, my kids giggled when they saw them. They ate them though. Maybe you can tweak them for us. Thanks",
