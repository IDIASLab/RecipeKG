To the reviewer who was confused about the weight of the salmon, I  agree the recipe assumes an experienced cook.  I think it is intended for  4-6 people, which means 1.5 - 2 pounds of salmon, depending on appetite and additional options available.  A salmon filet that can be cut into 6 pieces  typically weighs  between 0 .75 -  1 pound.",
