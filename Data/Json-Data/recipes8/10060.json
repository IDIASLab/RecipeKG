        "description": "Flavorful Cajun seasoning, cream, and Parmesan cheese are the stars in this dish, as is the incredibly juicy chicken that results from cooking sous vide. Traditionally you need to cook chicken to 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) or until no longer pink, however with sous vide cooking, you can achieve the same safety with extended cooking time at lower temperatures. Using an ice bath will lower the chicken temperature slightly, so that it does not overcook during the searing step. If you prefer a lot of sauce, double the sauce ingredients.",
