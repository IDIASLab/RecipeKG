Generally, I like my eggs cooked hard, but with the texture of the avocado, I didn't even notice that the yolk wasn't completely cooked through.  When prepping, I simply used an egg separator to keep the yolks intact.  And to keep the avocado halves from tipping, I sliced off just enough of the skin so that it created a flat surface.  Set the avocado half in the pan and voila - it doesn't tip!  Quick, easy, and nutritious - I will definitely be making this one again!",
