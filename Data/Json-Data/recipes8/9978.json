I lowered the temp as suggested with about 20 min to go & it was done exactly at 55 min.\nI love the poppy seeds, they add a neat texture. The cake is quite dense and great with a cup of coffee for breakfast. I made with a mix of red & black raspberries with some blueberries tossed in. This recipe would be great with any berries or even some cherries!",
