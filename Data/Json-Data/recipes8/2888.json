Because I do NOT buy pre-packaged kits I made my own taco salad bar with seasoned taco meat shredded lettuce chopped tomatoes salsa sour cream cheese olives onions and a bag of corn chips. We all enjoyed making our own salads and it was a nice family dinner. I'd make this again--four stars on the recipe's direction on how to make taco salad bowls without deep frying.",
