I don't believe my oven runs particularly hot; I would recommend cooking them for a minute or two less than the recipe states. They are gingersnaps, so be aware they are quite hard cookies. If you like a soft, moist cookie this recipe is not for you. Not a huge fan of the cinnamon sugar coating, but that's purely opinion based. Overall a fairly good ginger cookie recipe.",

Allrecipes cinnamon added a special spice to these as well. My daughter is the cookie maker in my house and we made these together. We also ate them together. The cookies didn't make it two days in our house -- they were so yummy! One of her favorite recipes.",
