The smell alone makes me feel like I am six years old and waiting for dinner to start. This recipe has been handed down from my Grandpa to my dad to me. The original recipe did not call for teaspoons or tablespoons, but with ounces and pounds. It can be made with or without chorizo. I prefer it with soy-based meatless chorizo substitute, which also makes it a good dish for vegetarians.",

Also I didn't like the vinegar soaked onions. When I was done cooking it I was thrown off by the final product and couldn't imagine eating it like it was. I quickly cooked up some eggs and served them on top to save the meal. I've always made my chilaquiles with eggs anyway. I also didn't use parm cheese I mean parm cheese? seriously? I crumbled queso fresco instead. I'll stick to my favorite traditional recipe from now on.",

Very very tasty a little on the spicy side (from the chorizo) and not very substantial - more like a thick meatless chili. I followed the recipe exactly used all the optional ingredients but used shredded cheddar. I think I'll make this again as it was very tasty but instead not fry the tortillas (very labor intensive to fry them crisp just to turn around and put them in a sauce to soften) OR use the corn tortillas to make enchiladas and pour the sauce over. UPDATE: I wanted to make this had all the ingreds except only flour tortillas. The difference in taste and texture was huge - do not substitute with flour tortillas.",

Like Betty I cannot seem to find corn tortilla's here in Jersey so I too used the chips instead. Just because I had it in the house I poached boneless chicken breasts which I shredded and added to the dish. I always use cocoa powder in my chile and love that layer of flavor not to mention the nice color it gives the sauce so if it sounds strange to anyone give it a go; you won't be sorry. My daughter went nuts over this recipe and immediately gave it five stars. (Update on this recipe: Important and sorry but I forgot to include that I could not find the tomato sauce suggested in the recipe so I used plain sauce and added a bit of cayenne. A friend of mine did use the hot tomato sauce and he was sorry he did. Beware it's quite spicy) Very good JollyRogers and thank you!!",
