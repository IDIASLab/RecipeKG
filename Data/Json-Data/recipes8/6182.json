I sealed the pocket closed with toothpicks and then rolled the chicken in the butter and bread crumbs. Very easy!",

I made the recipe \"Chicken Cordon Blue II\" (also from this site) the night before and had some sauce left over, so I made this recipe for the chicken the second day and served it with that sauce to do a comparison. To me the sauce is the best part so I would probably recommend that recipe over this one. However, I think I enjoyed the chicken more with this recipe because it was so juicy. So if you make this recipe, try making the sauce from the other recipe to go along with it. You'll love it.",

I had 4 large chicken breasts about 1/2 pound each and I was able to slice an opening down the middle of each breast to put the rolled up ham slices and cheese. I used about 3  tooth picks per chicken breast. My bread crumbs were not seasoned so I added 1 tsp Italian seasoning and garlic powder. I also went ahead and decided to add my own sauce since one review said it was a little dry alone. I mixed one can cream of chicken soup(98% fat free) with about 1/4-1/2 cup white cooking wine and poured it over the chicken before baking. I cooked it for about an hour or until the soup mixture got bubbly.",
