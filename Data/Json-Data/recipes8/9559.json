        "description": "Curry chicken salad is one of my favorite recipes to make ahead for a week of effortless but delicious lunches. This recipe is so flavorful and has ton of great texture. There are so many ways you can eat this chicken salad: sandwich, mixed into a salad, scooped into lettuce cups, spooned into cucumbers or other veggies, dipped with pita, spread on top of toast, or just eaten straight out of the container! Curry chicken salad is also a great party app, just place dollops in little cucumber cups, finger sandwiches, or crackers and serve!",
