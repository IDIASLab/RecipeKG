I cooked mine for 6 hours and the meat still didn't fall off the bones. So I continued to cook them for 4 more hours (started it at 6:00am) and the meat was still clinging to the bones. As for what to serve it with: I made a brown gray and wide egg noodles with corn on the side. Like I said the flavor was awesome! Just too time consuming.",

Also omitted the thyme b/c I was out.   Used more salt.  Pork needs a lot of salt. TG we don't have high blood pressure.  I also put texjoy steak seasoning heavily on each pork neck due to slow cooker breaking down the seasoning.  I did use the 4 cups of liquid - 2 cups beef broth & 2 cups water.   Due to the fact i cooked 7 lbs.  The flavor was amazing!  Cooked white rice, southern fried cabbage and skillet fried potatoes. Yes a truly southern meal!  My family loved it all.",

The pork is juicy and tender and from almost four pounds of neck bones I got about three cups of shredded pork. The nearly four pounds of bones cost me about 6 in central Virginia. The only drawback is the bits of gristle and fragments of bones that I had to spit out nearly every time I ate a helping even though I tried to carefully pick through the meat after removing it from the bones. I ate pulled pork sandwiches and burritos for several days so all in all this recipe will join my other favorite offal recipes.",
