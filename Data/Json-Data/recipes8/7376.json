I looked up other peanut brittle recipes and found what I think is an error in this one. This needs to be heated to 300 degrees rather than 250 degrees. I also upped the amount of baking soda to 1 1/4 teaspoons to make it a bit lighter. I made this recipe again with my changes and it turned out great!!! Bacon makes everything better!!!!",
