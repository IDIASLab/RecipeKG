The cubes stuck together in one big clump so it didn't cook evenly. Hindsight I should have just shaved a minute off of pressure time and never froze it. As written, this was way too watery (even after the cornstarch was added) to eat right away. I had to remove the liner out of the pot and set it aside to cool for 10 minutes before it ever started to thicken. Overall this was an okay recipe but not one I would probably make again.",
