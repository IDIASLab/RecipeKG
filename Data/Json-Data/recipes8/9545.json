Don't forget that using a pressure cooker/InstantPot requires prep time just like any recipe, so allow yourself time for that - and for the pot to come to pressure - if you are planning to eat at a specific time. Definitely wait til the end to add any salt. I added none and it was just right bc my beef broth had sodium in it.  Served over Jasmine rice. Perfect!",
