Bolognese is a delicious meat sauce that is refined and simmered for hours to bring out the great flavors of all the ingredients. Combine it with tagliatelle or with your favorite pasta to create a satiny, creaminess from the pasta starches that make this a memorable meal. Serve with a loaf of crusty Italian bread.",

The balance of flavor and ratio of meat to tomatoes is spot on. As my Italian husband ate this, he told me how it reminded him of his favorite trattoria when he was in high school in Novara. Thank you for the recipe, Howard.",
