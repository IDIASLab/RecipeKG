My chops were right at one inch thick and they definitely needed the 10 minute cook time per side but the crackers  start to burn at the 5 minute mark. They also have zero flavor as written. Even just adding a little bit of salt brought out the buttery flavor of the crackers. For the 2nd batch I only cooked them for 4 minutes each side just so I could get a decent picture and then back in the skillet they went to finish cooking/burning.",
