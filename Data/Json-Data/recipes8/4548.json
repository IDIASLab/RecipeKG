I adjusted the recipe slightly to use a bit less sugar (just as a personal taste preference), so I only used 1 1/2 cups sugar in the cake and 3/4 cup sugar in the glaze--and that was perfect. Would definitely do that amount of sugar again! I did find that the cook/bake times were a bit off for me. I pulled the cake after 64 minutes, and it was just a touch dry. So I would start checking it for doneness after about 55 minutes. And for the glaze, I found I needed to reduce it for about 25 minutes in order to get it to a 'syrup-y' thickness. It does make a lot of glaze too--so I might only use 1 cup orange juice and a 1/2 cup sugar next time (plus the orange zest). Overall though, this is a really nice orange-y flavored cake, and I would definitely make it again! Thank you for the recipe!",
