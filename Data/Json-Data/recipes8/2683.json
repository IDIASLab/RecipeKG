For those people that didn't use the 2 cheeses, you are MISSING OUT!  The cheeses together were amazing.  I normally don't like this much cheese, but it was sooooo good.  Also, we followed the reviewer that recommended the bean and bacon condensed soup and taco seasoning.  Those were perfect add-ons.  I can't imagine using cream of chicken.  The bean and bacon has the consistency of beans/refried beans and with the taco dip added in, it tasted just like a Mexican dish.  I would recommend to just layer the ingredients and add more tortillas.  I ended up with 5-6 tortillas in the dish and husband and I both thought that amount should have been doubled.  Like the previous poster said, the whole thing just fell apart by the time it's done and probably would have held up better with a lot more tortillas and layering.  Plus it would have cut down on prep time by quite a bit.  One last thing. . .to \"roast\" the chicken (I'm not a cook so I didn't really know how to do this) we used boneless chicken thighs on high broil for 10 minutes - 5 minutes on one side and 5 minutes on the other and then cut that up and put it in the dish (leave them still a bit pink).  I was SHOCKED at how tender and yummy the chicken was this way!!  I will probably do this for many more recipes now that I know.  This will be a regular in our house!!",
