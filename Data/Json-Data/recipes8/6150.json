What I ended up with was the puckering taste of lime to end all limes (granted, I juiced those limes well, as I used to work in a southwest Mexican/Mediterranian restaurant as a prepcook).  It's a good start, just needs some tweaking.  I would at least double or triple the amount of ginger and garlic called for.  It had 0 heat even with four jalapeno bodies (maybe he meant to use ceranos but, it's not stated), so add the seeds too. I noticed when I was making this that there is no salt or pepper and thought that was a little odd.  Add a couple tsp of salt at least and maybe a few cracks of pepper.  It's a good base, but really with the zest of four limes AND all their juice, they overpowered the amount of the rest of ingredients included in the recipe and all I got was a bitter lime taste.  Also, could try adding some sugar as well.  Help cut the extreme bitterness of the lime.   That's my 2c anyway.  Thanks for the recipe.  (btw, i tried to remedy by sprinkling salt, cracked pepper, and cumin over skewers the second day, it helped).",

I learned somewhere along the way that a citrus marinade essentially cooks seafood if left too long (and 4 hours would be considered too long) so I marinated the shrimp for about a half hour and it absorbed the flavor perfectly without sacrificing texture. I sliced some extra onion and grilled it with the shrimp in a grill pan until it was nice and caramelized--yum! This was easy to prepare and went very well with Sweet and Sassy Vanilla Slaw also from this site.",
