I added onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper to the beef broth like others did.  I sauteed green bell pepper, onion and mushroom to add to sandwich under the provolone.  Gotta get them veggies in!  I am still trying to find the bread that will hold up to the juice as the hoagie turns too mushy, maybe toasting it as others have done will make the difference.  I'll try that next time.  I have found that the sandwich turns out best with good quality meat from the deli.  This is a keeper for my family as we can customize to individual tastes, quick to prepare and yummy.  ",
