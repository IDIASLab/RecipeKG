The ingredients list should either be split into \"milk base\" and \"whipped coffee\" or there should be measurements in the instructions. It did come out beautifully and the whipped coffee was decadent. I thought the milk base was not sweet enough and the canned pumpkin didn't add anything to it and tasted too raw. In fact, when I try it again, I'll leave that out.",

This is extremely strong- not the coffee, but primarily the largely uncooked spices. You do of course get the raw pumkin taste too, but it's in no way as strong as the \"my mouth is full of raw nutmeg\" impression you first get. I had to stir in a 1/3c of Whipped Cream to even get halfway through my cup. Additionally, the spices and powdered coffee do give a paradoxically powdery texture despite it being a drink. I think I might try to use the other serving (recipe serves 2) as a replacement for liquids in a cookie recipe or something as to not waste it, cause... it might go down the drain otherwise. \n\nDisappointed that Allrecipes would feature a recipe on a full page when it had only a single 3-star review. That was misleading and trust damaging.",
