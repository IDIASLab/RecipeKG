I definitely recommend starting with a smaller amount of sugar and sweetening further to taste - the given ratio of rhubarb to sugar is 3:1, but I would start around 4:1 or even 5:1 and see how it is! This was perfect on a toasted, buttery English muffin alongside a pan-scrambled egg for breakfast, and it would be delicious with a crumble topping, over ice cream, instead of strawberries in a shortcake, or even alongside roast pork or turkey a la cranberry sauce! Overall, definitely recommend, and I can't wait to make it again",
