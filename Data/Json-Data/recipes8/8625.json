I used chicken breasts, just because that's what we prefer, and marinated it only for two hours because I ran out of time and the flavors still came through beautifully.  I loved the sweet chili sauce and the spicy chili sauce all rolled into one.  I made this with Thai Pineapple Fried Rice (one of our lovely Buzz lady's personal recipe) and it made a perfect meal.  This will be a definite repeat meal in my house!",

I did a taste test before pouring the marinade into my chicken breast bag and felt it needed a tad more sweetness, so added a tablespoon of honey and that did the trick. I also like to add a teaspoon of cornstarch to marinade that I'm going to be reheating on the stove top to use for basting. The sauce will thicken just a bit and sticks better to the meat. Any leftover makes a great dipping sauce. Thanks LoreleiLee for your submission...going on my rotation for grilling sauces.",

I left out the curry powder and added 1 T. of honey as mentioned by another reviewer. I used half as a marinade and thickened the other half with a cornstarch/water slurry. Hubs used part of that to baste on while grilling and we used the rest as a dipping sauce. The result was a beautifully grilled chicken breast with a wonderful sheen from the basting sauce. Very yummy! This is a definite do again!",
