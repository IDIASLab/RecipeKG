I also rubbed the garlic salt and pepper between the skin and the meat as well as on the outside and also in the cavity of the bird. Then followed the instructions as written. After the marinade was finished I used the same rosemary and ginger from the bird along with the giblets neck some garlic onions celery and carrot to make a very yummy stock which I then turned into the gravy since frying a turkey does not give any drippings. It was so flavorful that I did not even have to season it. I would love to taste this same marinade on a baked bird. Will definitely make this again!",
