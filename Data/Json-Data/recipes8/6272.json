Truly a man's meal, and not for the faint of arteries, this dish combines three of men's favorite things: Grilling, Bacon, and Chili. Don't love it till you try it! Goes well with a light beer and mashed potatoes.",

I add. a little more chili and a dab of the BBQ sauce inside. Take your time slow cook on the outside/cooler portion of the grill. We turn them one time mop with sauce then once more before pulling to serve. Amazing how one of these will fill almost anyone! Again Oh So Good!!! Serve with the grilled Mexican corn and the meal is complete!",

I think the chicken has to be thinnner than called for it didn't cook on the inside until the soaked skewers were turned to ash. The texture in the middle was \"weird\" where the chili met the chicken meat. They did love the bacon-y chicken bbq sauce flavor combo. I think next time I'm going to just make the chicken and bacon part and serve the chili and cheese on the side.",
