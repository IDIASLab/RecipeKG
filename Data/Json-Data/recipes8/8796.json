We were also given several packages of pasta sauce and plain yogurt. Last week we were given a bag of very small onions. We didn't have garlic cloves but I did have granulated garlic, so that's what I used. We cubed 2 lbs of turkey breast, used apple cider vinegar, no parsley. We cooked it in our skillet. It turned out awesome.",

It is spicy enough that my lover of hot food enjoyed it and I, who doesn't like anything other than spicy but never hot flavor, both enjoyed it tremendously.  You can feel heat but it never burns.  The spice mix is excellent and it creates a wonderful sauce that is semi-thickened.  I did change the yogurt to 1/2 cup and I added 1 cup of sour cream into the sauce.  I knew that would fit my family tastes more closely- but it would still be excellent without.  Well done!",
