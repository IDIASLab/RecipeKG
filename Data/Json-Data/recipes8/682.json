I won first prize in the Breads, Cookies, and Cakes category and the Grand Prize overall. I've always wanted to enter a baking contest, and it was fun. The only criteria was the recipe had to have pumpkin in it. I researched it and didn't find another recipe like it. I hope you and your family enjoy it! Decorate with fall foliage as desired.",
