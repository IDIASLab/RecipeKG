It is a blend of water, coconut milk, and any variety of pulped tropical fruit such as coconut, watermelon, mango, and pineapple but is almost always watermelon as it is plentiful in Tonga. A small amount of sugar may be added, although the recipe is considerably sweet on its own. I lived in Sydney many moons ago and the Polynesian families drank this by the gallons in the summer. Soooo refreshing and yummy! Serve over ice cubes.",

So I added the second half of watermelon (blended). Added more water. Added pineapple juice. Still thick. So I strained all of it and got it to a liquid stated. By that point it was lime heavy (I don't know how) so I added the sugar (1/2 cup). It's finally to the point that I don't mind drinking it.
