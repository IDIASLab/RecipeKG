I've done about 1/3 head of cabbage each time so it works out to be about equal parts zucchini and cabbage. I added potatoes and rutabega when I wanted it more hearty for my husband. I substitute 1 tbsp minced garlic for the garlic salt. The sausage has enough salt so I don't add any. Everyone has thoroughly enjoyed this dish even those who aren't into healthy eating! I made it with a couple big spoons of salsa once when I didn't have any tomatoes. It was good that way too!",
