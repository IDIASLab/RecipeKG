The pudding like consistancy I found to be quite pleasing as well as the nip of bitterness from the cocoa...I love it when I can use avocados in another way and put a twist on something. And this is absolutely wonderful. For myself, I used a honey alternative, to cut down the sugar but with the same taste as honey. Hands down, if I want something sweet late night, I'm going for this. It was soo simple and easy to make as well as the overall thickness, smoothness and the easy of throwing a few ingredients in a little food processor. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!! And if you like a little nip of bitter chocolate, you will love this. It wasn't overly powerful and it wasn't milky sweet, to me, it was simply just right.",

It was like a thick slightly sticky pudding in texture and kind of tasted like bittersweet chocolate. This is definitely not sweet like one would think of frosting made with butter and powdered sugar. If I was on the paleo diet I would be satisfied with this on yellow cupcake. Assuming there is some type of paleo version of a cupcake. I made 1/2 recipe to try it and got about little over a 1/2 cup.",

When I made the recipe as is there was a bit of bitter aftertaste that was just too strong for our tastes (plus I was trying to get this by 12 seven year olds for a birthday party and it did not pass my son's initial taste test). SO I added some powdered sugar until the bitterness was covered and voila! The cupcakes with this frosting were the hit of the party (we also had regular cupcakes with buttercream frosting available). The extra powdered sugar does not make this frosting extra healthier by any means but it was definitely very good. Thanks for the recipe!",
