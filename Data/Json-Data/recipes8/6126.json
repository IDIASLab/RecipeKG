For those of us who work all day long, bear in mind that if you try to marinate this all day it will not be as tender.  Shrimp are delicate, and the lemon juice \"cooks\" them if left in the fridge too long.  2 or 3 hours would be the max for large shrimp; stick to the one hour if you have medium shrimp.  And don't overgrill them!  Just cook them until they turn pink/opaque and curl up.  Otherwise they can turn dry and rubbery.  This dish has AMAZING flavor, and everyone loves it!  BTW, this marinade is also great on salmon.",

I also did not have the course mustard called for, so I substitued with the new French's Sweet Onion mustard.  Even my 13 year old, who swears she does not like seafood, devoured her skewer of shrimp! **Also, I cut down the amount of mustard called for!  I only used 1 TBSP of mustard, and that was PLENTY!!
