I make it for potlucks, holidays, football games, or a meal/appetizer at home. Although I consider this a somewhat advanced recipe, it is easy to master. It is my most-requested recipe! Serve alongside your favorite marinara sauce. Freezes very well!!",

The 1st rise time was closer to 2 hours but it's winter so that's how it goes. Once rolled into the rectangle I did spread fresh garlic puree (grated on a rasp) before the egg wash. Also sprinkled the provolone with grated parmesan a few red pepper flakes and dried oregano in addition to the pepperoni. Second rise sprinkled top with garlic powder and baked for 38 minutes. I did only make half this recipe which made a HUGE loaf. Unless you have a bunch of hungry li'l monkeys (kids!) half was plenty. Next time I think I'll try very thinly sliced smoked ham instead of the pepperoni and gruyere cheese instead of provolone to switch it up. All in all a great recipe!",
