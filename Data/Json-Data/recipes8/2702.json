I used flour tortillas almost a whole pack of cream cheese maybe 1/2 pack of taco seasoning I threw in some taco blend shredded cheese came out good just seemed a bit salty from the taco seasoning but i also didnt use a full pack of cream cheese either if i had then it may have not been to salty my fault..i used picante sauce for dipping..It was good jalepenos are a good idea but i didnt put any on since the kids were eating it too Thanks for the recipe.",
