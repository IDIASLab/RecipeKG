While I love a really bright burst of tart cranberry flavor, I felt like this was a bit too tart. I'm thinking that another 1/4-1/3 cup brown sugar in the topping would go a long way to helping that.  I found the actual cake portion to be drowned-out flavor-wise, as the cranberries really took over everything. If I made it again, I would definitely add more sugar to the topping, more vanilla extract to the cake (and maybe a bit of almond extract too), and probably swap the milk for either buttermilk or sour cream. Overall, this is a stunningly beautiful cake, that's worth making--with a few tweaks. Thanks for the recipe!",
