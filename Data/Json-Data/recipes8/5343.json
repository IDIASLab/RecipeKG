It takes a lot of time to make and mine should have cooked longer. I took it out after 45 minutes even though the center looked jiggly because everyone was waiting for it. I think it needed the 60 minutes. It has a sweet taste without a lot of sugar. I will defiantly make this one again and try it with sweet potatoes.",
