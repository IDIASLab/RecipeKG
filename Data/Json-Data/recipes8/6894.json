Dipped flour, egg batter and back to flour before frying. Used cornstarch for the tapioca, used white wine instead of Pingo, and also had to add a little cornstarch to the sauce to thicken to our preference.  Served over Grandma's Armenian Rice Pilaf & prosciutto wrapped asparagus from this site. Delish! The combo of lemon/garlic/white wine sauce over buttery pilaf and side of beautiful asparagus made it feel light despite the true calorie count for all recipes! Thanks for posting this! Would make again\u2026.on nights I have patience to dip, dip, dip!  ;)",
