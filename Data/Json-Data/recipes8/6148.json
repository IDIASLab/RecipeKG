Also, when I make kebabs (Indian or Greek) I often use half ground lamb, half ground beef - the flavor is really excellent, and the meat stays a little more moist than if using just lamb. I serve these on warm split naan breads or paratha with a drizzle of cucumber raita. With a leafy salad, some onion chutney, and a couple of pappadums, this makes an awesome meal. 8/9/07 Made these again for lunch today. Absolutely outstanding. I'd forgotten how much I love them! Thanks so much, Yakuta!",

I waited a few hours and took a small portion of it and made a 'sample' hamburger to see what needed to be tweeked.  It tasted very nice and I could see it would hold together for kabobs.  I did add 1 tsp. of allspice because having company from Jordan for dinner so wanted to tweak this a little middle eastern.  Soaked the skewers first so I would not need to call the fire dept. later.  Put these on the broiler pan lined w/aluminum foil brushed w/oil and put them in the broiler.  These would be great on the summer grill.  Served these with \"Red Lentil Curry\" and \"Indian Spiced Rice\" here on allrecipes and it made a very nice meal.  Great presentation on the skewers.",
