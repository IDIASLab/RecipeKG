Either way it is delicious. Also if you have ham sometimes we throw them both in. This recipe was on target but I must say I have never had it with mushrooms so I did not include them when I made this recipe. The cheese sauce was good but I will add that you don't necessarily have to use parmesan cheese. Here in Kentucky we use whatever we have on hand. Suprisingly Velveeta works great in this recipe. However if you use Velveeta don't tell anyone because it cuts down on the classiness of the dish. lol",

Instead of individual sandwiches I made it into a casserole by layering the bread turkey sauce bacon tomato more sauce and finally some parmesean cheese. The bread was a little soggy so next time I will toast it more before and I didn't add mushrooms I can't stand them. Oh yeah I added about 1/2 c. of cheddar to the sauce as well. Thanks again for the recipe!",

I also remember the tomato was brioled with olive oil, basil and parmesan cheese and served on the side at the Hotel...this was  my favorite 'after turkey day' meal for years.  My Grandaughter called and asked me what the left over turkey sandwich was with the cheese and bacon on top...She wanted to make it.  This is a great dish...impressive, too,from leftovers!",

Last night I watched Bobby Flay's \"Throw Down\" show and was immediately reminded. As a matter of fact \"Downalong\", the Brown Hotel you referred to in your review was Bobby's challenge. Although I took one tip from Bobby which was to do the bread French toast style and the hotel boys cheddar sauce, I followed your recipe to a \"T\". I knew my girls would love this dish, but I wasn't quite as sure about hubby as he's not so into the whole cheese sauce thing. Kristie, I'm so thrilled to tell you that hubs absolutely LOVED your recipe!! I think it's so cool serving a dish that one of our States and/or Countries around the world are so famous for. Thanks Kristie for allowing the rest of us a taste of the Derby!!",
