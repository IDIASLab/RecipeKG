The salt is part of what breaks down the carrot and cabbage, and I end up wasting less cayenne and pepper if I add it at the same time as the eggs. There seems to be a lot of variation in what can go into one of these too, if my YT recommendations are anything to go by.",

I basically did  (i giggle because I loathe when someone says they made a recipe and when I read what they did, it sounds like they reworked the entire recipe)\nInstead of the carrots and cabbage as in the recipe, I bought a bag of slaw mix with some carrots in it. I mixed the eggs up in a couple of handfuls of the slaw mix and cooked that at the time specified in the recipe. Heated up the ham while I was cooking the egg/slaw mixture. Applied a thin smear of mayo to both bread slices and dotted that with ketchup. Sprinkled a bit of sugar over all that. Put the sammich together from there. Had enough egg/slaw mixture to cook later today. \nAnd as always...\nEnjoy",
