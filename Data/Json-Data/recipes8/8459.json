I've been using Country Crock Plant Sticks with Avocado Oil and I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  By leaving it out on the counter while the potatoes were steaming brought it to a super spreadable consistency- it mixed in with the zest beautifully.  My only call out is that the \"butter\" soaked into the potatoes really fast, it could have used more.  So for 3 pounds, I'd recommend a 1/2 C of Country Crock.  The zest, paired with the mild potato and the savory \"butter\" was a great bite.",

The combination of the creaminess of the potatoes with the tang if the lemon zest and of course,  the buttery richness really made these potatoes something special! I did have an issue trying to smash them in the bowl, so I just lined a cookie sheet with foil and did the smashing and slathering there and then transferred it to the serving bowl, which worked so much better. I will definitely be using this recipe over and over! Thanks for sharing ??",

The one thing I would recommend is to microwave the Country Crock in a dish for 30 seconds to soften and add lemon zest after it has cooled slightly.
