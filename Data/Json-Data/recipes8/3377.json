I read the other reviews and decided to give this recipe a try since my family loves fried rice.  After making this dish, I must say, it is AWESOME!!!  I have no idea why some of the reviews said it was bland.  All I can figure out was that they did not make it correctly.  Everyone in my family thought this was a very tasty dish.  I'm glad I read the reviews and remembered to use COLD rice that had been in the refridgerator over night.  I can't wait to try this recipe again with chicken....hmmmmm, or maybe even mini shrimp.....yummy!!!!  Thank you so much for this recipe Glo!  I will be making this on a regular basis.",

I had four hungry mouths to feed and there are still plenty of leftovers (which is ok to me!). I made 3 changes: First, I scrambled the eggs in a seperate dish rather than do it in the leftover sausage grease. Second, I added just a splash of oil to the grease (to make sure there was enough) and when heated, I added the cabbage & then the cold rice (why must it be cold? I don't know). Finally, when the rice was slightly browned, I added a pkg of frozen (thawed) broccoli stir fry veggies instead of chopping my own, which has brocoli, onions, mushrooms, red peppers and water chesnuts. Once adding the eggs/soy sauce, this is a pretty dish and VERY filling. Would repeat this recipe again! Thanks Gloria!",
