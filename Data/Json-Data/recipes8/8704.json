Spicy is great, but 7 oz would kill us! (I learned this the hard way in a different recipe) I strongly advise starting with one and doing taste tests to find your limit.  Whenever I open a can to cook Mexican foods, I spoon one out with some of the sauce and freeze the rest to use.  I have forms for my taco salad shells and bake after painting with a little olive oil at 400 degrees, for 10-12 minutes.  You could probably make them out of foil too.  I hope Chef John gives some pointers for making great salad shells in one of his next videos!",

If you're using the recipe in burritos as we did, it's perfect as the other ingredients mellow out the heat.  If I were making it for tacos or another recipe that it was more front and center, I would reduce the amount of peppers by 1 or 2.  All that being said, we made burritos with rice, beans and cheese and then topped each one with a bit of the sauce and some more cheese and tossed them under the broiler for a minute and it was truly amazing.  Served it with a side of shredded lettuce, tomato,  onions and fresh guacamole and garnished with fresh cilantro and cotija cheese . Far better than anything you can get at a restaurant.",

I also cut time by using my instant pot my chicken went in frozen for 20 mins. Every picky person (I usually make multiple meals) in my home complemented this. We didn t find this to be too spicy after removing the seeds. I have a 9yo and a FIL w/heartburn issues and I got no complaints.
