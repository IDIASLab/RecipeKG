The point is the cucumber has 92% water no matter what you do cannot be dry always will release water in the mixture especially in the fridge.So have the strained yogurt already cold cool and mince the cucumber and mixed it immediately.You can add walnuts they go very well with that salad which is best tasting in that particular moment when is really fresh.It doesnt pays to substitute the yogurt with different dairy products it will be poor imitation seen it too many times.Also if dont strain the yogurt but watered it keep everything else just pinch of salt makes great cold soup.Now you can grate the cucumber otherwise MINCED please.",
