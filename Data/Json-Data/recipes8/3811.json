That is another pie made with Ritz crackers that uses all the apple pie flavors:cinnamon sugar etc that make it taste like that. This pie is totally different with almost a chewy brownie-like texture because of the egg whites and nuts. My mom made this pie back in the 50s/60s and it has always been my favorite. We called it Ritz Cracker Pie for the obvious reasons and I continue to make it often. There are the doubters who give me a dubious look when I mention the name... until they try it!! Then they love it! Hmmm maybe I ll change the name to Heavenly Pie!",

This basically is a non-crust pie comprised of meringue, crackers, and nuts.  The crackers definitely added something to the firmer consistency, but the dominating flavor really is the nuts.  If walnuts are not your favorite, would recommend trying another type of nut, such as pecans (that\u2019s what I\u2019d used if I made this again).  Cracker pies don\u2019t have a whole lot of eye appeal, but they are super simple to make, they bake up quickly, and they taste pretty good.",
