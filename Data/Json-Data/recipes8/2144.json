I didn't remember the applesauce being in the recipe, and  I paused at the 325F temp, but  was convinced it was the recipe I've used in the past and followed directions.  It isn't.   Where I've usually had two beautiful loaves of browned, crusty banana bread,  I have two loaves of what is essentially banana pudding.    The taste was there, but not the texture.   Perhaps if 8x4 pans were used instead of 9x5 this would work.    If you want a good loaf in a 9 x 5 pan, try Pineapple Banana Bread, recipe # 121120.",
