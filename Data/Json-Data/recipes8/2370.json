I omitted the mint and replaced half the lemon juice with lime juice, and I'm glad I did use the lime juice. It's a beautiful blend of tart and sweet (I used a very red, ripe watermelon). When I have mint on hand, I'll try it in this. If you want a thicker soup, make sure you blend this at a slower speed and check the consistency as you go. I chose to puree it all the way and end up with more of a liquid, which suited what I wanted. I can't wait to experiment with adding other fruits to the mix.",
