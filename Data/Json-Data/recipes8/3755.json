I'd suggest using a butter knife to tap and crack the eggs. When I tried to roll the eggs - it created a few large cracks that resulted in an excess of the dying mixture leaking into the egg. One of my eggs had such a big crack from this method - enough liquid leaked in that the entire shell came off - dying the entire egg brown. Like other users have mentioned - this is mainly for aesthetics as opposed to taste. The one egg that got soaked in the mixture did have a noticeable taste difference however (IMO). Also like another reviewer mentioned I used my own deviled-egg recipe in place of the suggested one from above. Check photos for my results.",
