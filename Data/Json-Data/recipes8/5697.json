This method worked perfectly for me more than once. I did as other reviewers recommended and blended high for 7 minutes followed by the addition of 3/4 cup confectioners sugar. The sugar amount initially confused me because but I found it worked with the sugar spooned into the measuring cup. Also I agree with the one reviewer that found the vanilla extract amount in the original recipe to be a bit much. I think it may depend on the quality or freshness of your extract perhaps? Mine was just opened. In any case I began putting in 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract at a time when blending and found that 3/4 tsp was perfect.",

Not only are dried egg whites completely safe to use in uncooked recipes, they whip up faster and higher than fresh and save the hassle of using leftover egg yolks. Pasteurized egg whites do not whip up as well as fresh egg whites (which whip up second-best after powdered dried egg whites). Be sure to bring egg whites to room temperature, and wipe out the mixing bowl with lemon juice or vinegar so that it's absolutely grease-free. Always use glass  or metal bowls to whisk egg  whites.  Add a little bit of something acidic (cream of tartar, a few drops of lemon juice) to help the egg whites to whisk up high and fluffy.",
