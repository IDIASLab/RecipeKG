I modified to my own taste by omitting the brown sugar and adding an extra cup of oats without increasing liquid portion of recipe to produce granola clusters (for cereal or yogurt) vs. granola bars. I also threw in a few handfuls of fresh cranberries and they added a nice tartness into the light sweetness of the rest of the granola. Thanks for a great recipe!",
