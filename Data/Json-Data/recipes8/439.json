I like to use center-cut bacon since it is leaner and less likely to cause flare-ups. I find cutting the bacon lengthwise, and then using the thin strips to wrap the bacon, is much easier than trying to wrap using a wide strip. Use your favorite BBQ rub on the chicken!",

I may try cooking it on a rack and covering with a tent foil next time as another comment suggested to see how that works. I used JB's Fat Boy's Sweet Rub. Easy, quick and tasty recipe.",

Instead the honey glaze, we used some leftover maple-chipotle glaze I had on hand and it was fabulous that way! My husband started the tenders out over a drip pan with an indirect charcoal fire to render the bacon fat a bit and cook other chicken gently then as they got closer to temp he put them over direct coals to crisp up the bacon. Then he glazed and put them over the coals again to firm up the glaze.\n\nWe served them like chicken and waffles, but with potato waffles from Lidl. They were the perfect savory accompaniment to the sweet and smoky chicken. We also had roasted green beans and grape tomatoes to round it out. So good!",
