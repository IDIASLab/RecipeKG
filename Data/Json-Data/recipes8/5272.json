This was a big hit and came very close to what we had in San Fran other than I do not recall tasting the texture of the actual Coconut.  That is one thing I would change next time around (I would chop the shredded Coconut very fine)...  I also used Cocnut Cream in place of the Coconut milk which gave even a stronger Coconut taste (YUM)...  We doubled the recipe and did serve with Cilantro...  PERFECT DISH!!!!  This one is going in the book. THANK YOU Karmabelle.",

Since I didn't have the coconut oil I looked in my pantry for another sweet oil; I had peanut and sesame so I went with sesame... This was very good and I can only imagine how good it would be with coconut oil... The lime and coconut made this rice one of the best rice sides I have tried!:)",
