It could be that a store-bought ranch dressing would have had enough, but I made Low Fat Buttermilk Ranch Dressing from this site, and it did not contain as much salt as the other would have.  Still this is really good and would definitely be something to take to a potluck gathering!  It would be especially good with BBQ-type food.  I love raw corn that is mixed with ingredients like this.  I will make this again!  Thanks!",
