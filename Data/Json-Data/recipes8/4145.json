Even though there were no reviews on this recipe I thought I'd give it a try. I didn't change a thing. Only baked it longer to get it golden brown on top. I will definitely make it again. Served it with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Used Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flour. Excellent!!!",
