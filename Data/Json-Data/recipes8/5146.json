Made it for our dinner and we love it.  I'm going to try the dressing for egg salad, macaroni salad and maybe even potato salad one day.  An added benefit to this is it is LOW CARB!!!  My husband and I are on a low carb diet, so I used equal in place of the sugar and it really is very, very low in carbs.  Thanks again!!!",
