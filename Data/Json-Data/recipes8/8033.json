I put 1 TBSP of olive oil and the minced garlic in the slow cooker, then covered with carrots (I used baby carrots).  Then topped with the chicken thighs (I used boneless, skinless), then covered the chicken with the garlic powder, lemon juice, and a little salt. \n\n2. Turn the slow cooker on High for 4 hours.\n\n3. At hour 3, I added 2 cups of broth.\n\n4. At 3 1/2 hours, I added 2 cups of Arborio rice.  \n\n5.  When my slow cooker turned itself off after 4 hours, everything was done!  \n\nNOTE: Do not use the Cayenne pepper.  It is way too spicy and completely overwhelms all the flavor.  If you do enjoy spice, just use a Teaspoon, not a tablespoon.",
