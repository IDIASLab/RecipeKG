They are super easy to put together and taste incredible! Watch out though, because there is nothing low-fat about them! I like to assemble these enchiladas in the morning or night before, come home and pop them in the oven.  When cold, add 10 more minutes to the baking time. Leave out the onions for picky eaters.",

I did saute the onions before putting them in(only cause raw onions are hard on my stomach) Husband loved them. They are Gluten free which is a plus in this house! Mix and match chili for different flavor. Add more filling don't that is what makes this recipe awesome. Having made a few times now we have even added spinach different cheeses and black olives. I like them when they are at the simplest! These can be made layered and not rolled. I am telling you it is versatile and awesome!!!! Thank you for the awesome recipe!",

Like I said in the description, these are definitely not low-fat, but they are pretty good every once in a while.  If your family is into freezer cooking, these are a great candidate. I prepare them through the rolled stage, then freeze them in their baking pan lined with foil.  After they freeze completely (overnight), I remove them from the baking pan, cover the foil wrapped enchiladas and wrap in plastic.  To cook, remove from freezer, pop enchiladas in foil back into baking pan, cover with sauce mixture, then bake an extra 15 minutes.  So easy and SOOOOO good, plus it doesn't take much extra time to make two or three pans than just one.",

I made a few swaps to help lower the cals... I used vegetarian chili (fat free) and cheddar cheese made with 2% milk. I also cooked chicken in crock pot with salsa and shredded for inside the enchildada. Lastly I only use half of the cheese. I put a little bit inside the enchilada and then the rest layered on top. Can't be all scientific about it but def lowered the fat/cal intake!",
