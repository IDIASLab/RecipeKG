I frozen mixed bell peppers and sauteed them and used some bread crumbs from french bread I had made and used grenadine in place of pomegranate molasses. Sorry for all that inauthenticness. Even so I did own everything else and I could eat this with a spoon! Thanks for giving me a recipe using sumac James!",
