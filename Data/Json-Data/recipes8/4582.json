I will most surely frequent allrecipes.com for more tasty recipes such as this one.  I think that the key is, if you have been cooking long enough, then you can kinda tweak any recipe to your own liking.  The addition of the Old Bay gave it the taste I was going for!",

Couldn't taste the shrimp, crab, mayo, dill or Old Bay seasoning (I added a dash for flavor). I think  something was missing... a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, more dill or sweet imitation crabmeat would have done the trick, I'm sure. Another reason for my low rating was due to texture - mine seemed kinda soupy (not really soupy, but enough to make me not care for this). Served on a croissant with a side of potato chips, this made a quick weeknight meal. I don't think I'll be bringing leftovers with me to work this week though. I should have tried Crab Salad by Christine as it seems to better suit my taste (and seems more like the deli stuff I like at my local grocer). Thanks anyways!",
