Also, Italians would probably not use an egg noodle like linguini with seafood, but a thin to medium spaghetti. That being said, if you must use Parmigiana, enjoy, but use it knowing it's your preference  and not that of us who know the (usual) Italian tradition of separating fish and cheese. If you are neutral, try it first without the cheese!",
