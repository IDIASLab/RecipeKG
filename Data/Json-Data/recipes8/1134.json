Instead of lemon zest though, I used lemon peel seasoning and I used lemon extract instead of lemon juice. It turned out amazing! I also added yellow food coloring to give it a \"lemon\" color. I'm definitely going to add more lemon flavoring next time though, but nevertheless, these were amazing. Thank you for the recipe!",
