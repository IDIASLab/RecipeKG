If I were to make it again I'd use maybe a half package of Neufch\u00e2tel cheese as it came out very thick and pasty with 1.5. I'd also season it ALOT more. I also had enough filling to fill 5 large peppers. I think it may have been better had I used very small peppers so the filling to pepper ratio would have been more even. Last not but least I did parboil my peppers in salted water for 3 mins before baking them as the recipe stated. My peppers were still too crunchy so I would recommend parboiling for about 5 mins before filling.",

Maybe I shouldn't rate it because I didn't make it as listed but I plan on making it with the bacon and mushrooms and I'm certain it will be delicious. Thanks so much for the idea of using the alfredo sauce. A great change from the typical tomato based sauce used on peppers. Will definitely make again!",
