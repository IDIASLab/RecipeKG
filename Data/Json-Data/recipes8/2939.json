Sometimes I use chopped jalapenos instead of the green chilis for some added heat.  You can also use flour tortillas instead of corn and it's just as good, maybe even better since the corn tortillas can be a bit tough sometimes.  You can also substitute cream of celery soup which I often do when I don't have cream of chicken.  It's a very flexible recipe.  My family has enjoyed this recipe for years.",

Now... the only critique I have is that  it should probably be cooked a little longer, or the onions should be cooked with the chicken because they weren't quite fully cooked when we ate them. The only variant I did from this recipe was sprinkle a small layer of cheese in between my layers (think lasagna) But a GREAT recipe that had my husband stuffing himself until he couldn't eat anymore, and I had 2 plates, myself!",
