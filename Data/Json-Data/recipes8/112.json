I used a small cookie scoop which is a little larger than the teaspoon that is listed in the recipe.  I think the teaspoon would be better.  As it was, I got 30 cookies, and I baked eight to a sheet of parchment on my 18x12 cookie sheets.  I wish I had cooked them for just a touch longer, but it doesn't matter because they were gone by the time everyone left the house.  Thanks, Dustin, for your grandmother's recipe!",

Use a small teaspoon and keep them far apart. They are going to spread out A LOT. But that is the charm of this cookie. If too close you will get the big blob that somebody else commented on.
