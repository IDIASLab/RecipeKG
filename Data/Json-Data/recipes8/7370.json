I baked the chops at 325 for 1-1/2 hrs. - turned them over for the last 15 minutes to brown the other side. As a side I bought a bag of small butter potatoes and used the garlic potato recipe I found on this site. We cut them in half and tossed in olive oil, parsley flakes, minced garlic and salt and pepper. I had some chop stuffing left over so when the potatoes were baked we added a little velveeta cheese and half and half to the leftover stuffing mixture, cooked it just until the cheeses melted and spooned it over the potatoes. Delicious! I'm terrible at overcooking pork chops but these were tender and moist and I used bone-in chops because I got them on sale. Family loved this meal - thanks John!",

I did saute a chopped apple, red grapes and craisins in a little butter, and added brown sugar, and a touch of cinnamon and cayenne pepper. Nice fall dish, along with butternut squash and a red blend wine. I just had half a chop, since they were quite large.",
