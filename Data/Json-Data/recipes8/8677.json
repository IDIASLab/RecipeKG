I steamed the rice in the morning and put in the fridge so it would be cold when I added it to the wok.  I needed to stretch the meal, a little bit, so I added some steamed broccoli and carrots.  This dinner came together quickly which in my book, makes it a great weeknight dinner.  Thanks natty's pantry, for sharing your recipe.  It will be used often.",

It is slightly sweet the onions ended up nice and caramelized and the cilantro adds a great perk and freshness element. I made the recipe as written expect for the following (lazy) changes: 1/2 tsp of black pepper to replace the white pepper I'm not sure how many cups of cooked rice I used but I originally measured out 1 cup of uncooked rice and I about doubled the cilantro. I might add some red pepper flakes next time to give it extra pizazz. I WILL be making this again thanks!",
