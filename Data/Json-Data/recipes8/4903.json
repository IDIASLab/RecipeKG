I tossed the peppers with a little olive oil and lightly salted them before broiling them. I didn't thoroughly char the peppers and I didn't peel them. The slightly browned edges add a wonderful flavor. Note: the peppers and mushrooms could be prepared in advance and then just rewarmed with the asparagus. This would be a perfect for company a vegetarian meal or served with shrimp would be wonderful. Heck you could cook the shrimp in the same skillet as the asparagus. Impressive!",

I added some sliced green onions (as I didn't have asparagus) to the mushrooms and balsamic vinegar to marinate. I added the mushrooms and green onions and balsamic vinegar to the peppers and baked a few minutes longer. I used extra garlic because we love it and saut\u00e9ed it in olive oil and ghee. Added all the veggies and saut\u00e9ed until warm. Thanks for a great recipe!",
