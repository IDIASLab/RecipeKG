Increased the horseradish to 1 tsp and added 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp onion powder for flavor.  Made fresh breadcrumbs and added 1 tbsp. Italian blended seasoning to them (again, to heighted the flavor profile).  Skipped the grated onion, but added 1/3 c fresh grated parmesan cheese to the topping.  You could easily add chopped chicken, browned ground beef of turkey to make it a one dish meal - or keep it as a stellar side dish!",

I then stirred in the mayo and proceeded as directed. My family loved it but I thought the mayo flavor was a bit overpowering....would like something more savory. I'll make again and play with the flavors. Thanks for a great starter recipe!",
