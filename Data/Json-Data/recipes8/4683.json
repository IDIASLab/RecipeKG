The only change I made was using a bag of frozen broccoli I needed to use defrosting and draining it and forgoing the boiling of the cauliflower as it was already tender when it defrosted. I was very impressed by how thick and cheesy the sauce got after a spin in the food processor. Definitely a keeper!",
