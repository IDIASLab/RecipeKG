I made mine with black beans and pinto beans (not kidney) frozen thawed corn red pepper in addition to the green pepper 3 limes instead of one 2 tbsp. olive oil 2 cloves minced garlic 8 oz. Monterey Jack Cheese cut into small cubes 1 can of sliced olives and 1 tsp. sea salt. Next time I make this I will add the jalapeno and use green onion instead of a regular onion and maybe more cheese. Tomatoes and avocado could be added as well. There are so many possibilities with this wonderful salad! Also this salad does have the potential to be dry. Tonight on my way home from work I bought a bottle of Newman's Own Light Lime salad dressing which I added to this salad. It was delicious and added a nice sweetness. I also plan on trying this with the cilantro-lime dressing by Lin on this site.",
