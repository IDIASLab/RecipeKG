I had to modify my version of this recipe but had near stellar results: I did not have cream of celery so I used cream of chicken (isn't tuna the 'chicken of the sea?'); and I did not have milk so I used 'A Taste of Thai' coconut milk. I backed off on the amount of onion (like the flavor of onion but it is the gift that keeps on giving) while adding 7 ounces of green peas and some grating of cheddar cheese on the eggs. A fairly easy dish that does not take a lot of time or effort to concoct. Thanks to chef who contributed it!",

I looked up the recipe out of necessity (didn't grocery shop when I should have and I had tuna to work with). I modified this recipe a bit. I added chopped feozen spinach because I saw it in another recipe and I love spinach. I also added grated cheddar cheese because I noticed a commenter who said she sprinkled cheese on top but I mixed it in with the casserole so the bread crumbs would still be on top. Because I usually don't have condensed soups on hand I made cream of celery feom scratch with fresh celery and I'm sure that makes the casserole even better. I was out of mustard powder so I tried mixing in a bit of turmeric in its place. And I halved the curry powder only because curry is such a strong flavor for me. And I omitted the eggs (I was out but I don't think I'd include them anyway). The only thing I'll do differently next time is sautee the onions before adding them to the mix so that they don't stand out so much in the finished product. My kids enjoyed it (even my very very picky six-year-old) so I'll probably double everything except the breadcrumb topping next time because there was room to make it deeper in my 9 13. First attempt at tuna casserole was a hit!",
