                "reviewBody": "Beautiful and delicious! I had a can of mango pulp that I picked up at a local Indian market, and I knew I wanted to make a pie or dessert with it, and not a drink. When my June/July 2021 Allrecipes magazine arrived in the mail and I saw this recipe, I knew I had to make it. The only change I made was to use the canned mango pulp (which is wonderful, by the way). Other than that, and toasting the coconut that gets sprinkled on top, I followed the recipe precisely. It is a very sweet pie - but everyone loved it! Both the mango and the coconut flavors really shine through. The crust ingredients could be scaled down a bit, as it was very thick and crumbly as I think there were too many graham crackers to the amount of butter called for. It was definitely an elegant dessert and a keeper!",
