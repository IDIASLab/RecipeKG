I used an enchilada sauce imported from Mexico because I love the flavor of it but it is a little thinner than lets say Old Elpaso so you might want to use that. The slaw was super fresh tasting and got better as it sat. Overall great recipe and one I will make again.",

For the sauce, I used chipotle salsa (which was right next to the can of peppers) and mixed it with mayo and sour cream.  I thought  the shrimp would be too spicy based on the amount of chili powder, but they weren't. The spiciest thing is the sauce, which you can control. I will be making these again!",
