As some suggested, I added garlic and red pepper  flakes, used the measurements as listed for only 2 chicken breasts and served over rice. In addition, I used chunky salsa instead of the diced tomatoes just because that's what I had on hand and I added lime juice to the crockpot (I didn't think that there was enough liquid to cook the chicken - didn't want to chance burning it). The 'juices ' were great on the rice. Very flavorful!  It was the best crockpot recipe I have made thus far.",

This looked like a quick and easy recipe and I was making a more complicated appetizer so I thought I'd try this. Also been meaning to break out the crock pot now that the snow's here. Doubled the recipe EXCEPT for the cilantro. Added some red pepper flakes and used canned diced toms with jalapenos for a little extra zip (we like it spicy!). I had some trouble rolling the breasts (first time I've done it) but the thin cutlets definitely helped. Wasn't sure if I liked the looks of it when it was cooking but it tasted great and we enjoyed it served over brown rice. It needs something else... I may throw in some fresh garlic next time or maybe chop up some onions. Also I think I want to put the mixture through the food processor. I think making the filling into the paste may add in the preparation. Thanks for the recipe -- definitely a great Sunday dinner!",

I made a couple of changes - #1 - I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and it was done in about 2 hours not 3. #2 - Since I was in a hurry I did not make rolls of them but instead laid the chicken on the bottom of the crockpot and then poured everything on top and just let it cook that way. I didn't give it a 5 because for me it could have used a bit of a punch maybe some pepper flakes or something else to spice it up a bit. Overall very simple very quick and will make again!",
