If your little cups don't turn out as lovely and perfect as the submitter's, do not worry.  Once people find out how good they are, they will disappear in a hurry!  I wondered if I should saute the veggies with the sausage, but I followed the recipe to a \"T\".  After making them, I would never recommend sauteing the veggies.  They  added a subtle crunch that offset the rich cheeses very nicely!  These were nearly addictive--they were THAT good.  Two practical comments:  dough squares will be a tad more than 2\" square, and any smaller will not come up the sides of your muffin tin as nicely; and, you can use a shiny muffin tin, but any sausage mixture that gets on the tin will need some attention.",
