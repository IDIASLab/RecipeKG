The texture of the cookies was good - soft with a good chewiness added from the oats. But the flavor was just not what I was hoping for. It was a little on the salty side and even with the toffee bits they are not sweet enough for me (and my 3yo son spit it out and said it was yucky). I'm new to persimmons so I don't have much recipe experience to compare to but I couldn't taste the flavor of persimmon at all- just the spices (and salt) I added in. And that was disappointing for me because I could achieve that with applesauce if I wanted to. Anyway my search for a great persimmon cookie recipe continues I suppose.",
