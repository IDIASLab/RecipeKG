I made a few changes though so hence only 4 stars. 1- I scaled down the recipe to fit in a 8x8 pan. 2- I added some cumin and S&P to the egg mixture. 3- I made my enchilada sauce mixed with a can of cream of mushroom soup- try it it's SO good. 4- I used 1/2 onion 1/2 green pepper & 1/2 yellow pepper for veggies. 5- Next time I'll fry the corn tortillas before laying them in the pan. Overall this recipe is a really nice mexican dish. Easy fast and tasty! Will definitely make again.",
