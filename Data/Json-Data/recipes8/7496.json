                "reviewBody": "For 30 of the frozen tart shells I used 1 Tblsp of Epicure 3-onion seasoning and 1 Tblsp freeze dried chives (skipped the sun-dried tomatoes).  Half was made with bacon I cut-up & cooked & cheddar cheese. The other half with jalapeno-monterey jack cheese.  I went with the 6-eggs version  of the recipe (noted for 16 tarts), and made all 30.  Perhaps I put more filling than others but they were delicious.\nThe jalapeno was cheesy, but needs more zip so I'll add some other spice next time or a stronger cheese than monterey jack or maybe crumbled hot italian sausage.  I will definitely make these again - or some version of them. Great to freeze and reheat whenever I want something different for any time of day.",

He is not a big scrambled egg fan but started commenting about these after his first bite. He said they were really good and full of flavor. If you don't like sun dried tomatoes roasted bell peppers work well too. I bought real bacon bits instead and for two reasons. 1. To save time and mess. 2. I despise \"wobbly\" bacon and the real bacon bits in a bag stay firm and crunchy through the baking process. These were so simple and will be a regular around here.",
