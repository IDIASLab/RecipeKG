Added cinnamon , peanut butter , shredded coconut , hemp seeds , sesame seeds , sunflower seeds . Ground seeds and nuts just slightly . Didn't have teff nor poppy seeds . Baked for about 17 minutes . Made a dozen regular size muffins and one mini loaf . Very moist , not too sweet . Will definitely make again .",

The only change I made was using some pecans rather than almonds; I thought I had almonds but the package in the freezer turned out to be pecans.  Recipe made 12 muffins and very, very small loaf.  Doesn't have much of a banana flavor which is a bonus for me.  Yummy!",
