The timing might be a bit long for back ribs as Chef John used St Louis Style Side ribs, but they were still mostly tender and only dry on the ends.  A bit plain flavour wise compared to a lot of recipes (especially those with glazes), it goes great with Chef John's \"All American BBQ Sauce\" recipe.\n\nRegarding the salt: I think the issue other reviewers have had is that Chef John uses kosher salt, and using the same amount of table salt will result in something too salty. It's about 2 tsp table salt for every 1 tbsp of kosher salt. I used a tablespoon (plus a bit extra to taste) of table salt since I'm all out of kosher, and the ribs (about 4 lbs of back ribs, so 2 large racks) turned out well seasoned.",

I let them sit for about 4 hours before cooking. I did an extra basting with about 30 minutes left, no idea if that made any difference. Will definitely make again.\n\nRegarding the saltiness, others have stated. Make sure you are using non-iodized kosher salt. This is very important. I'm not even sure swapping sea salt or Himalayan salt would be a good idea in this situation. The ratios of ingredients would be different. Also, use some common sense, know your own cooking preferences, use the amount of seasoning you think is right. Generally though from my experience, you do need to add a bit more than you think you would when cooking big pieces of meat.",

The mustard paste was made with Dijon and apple cider vinegar, and it was a great way to get the salt and pepper to stick.\n\nAfter seasoning, I let the ribs hang out overnight in the fridge, then smoked them the next day at 250\u00b0F using maple wood chunks for smoke. I basted them with a mixture of apple cider vinegar and Worcestershire sauce, and after four hours they were done.\n\nI served them with a very good BBQ sauce, which paired wonderfully with the rib meat, and the minimal seasoning was perfect so the pure taste of the pork really came through. My wife said those were the best tasting ribs I've ever smoked, so I've decided to season them this way for the rest of whenever!",

Doing so let's the rendered fat keep the meat moist as the cook goes on.\n\nI'll be making these again for sure, and I'm an ardent smoker of back ribs on my weber charcoal kettle.",
