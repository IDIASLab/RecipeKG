I would definitely make sure to use the jalapeno pepper sauce it brings out all of the flavors wonderfully but without it the dish is very plain. However I gave this 4 stars(which it really was a border line 3-4 but since i personally liked it i bumped it up to 4)because my family wasn't very impressed. My husband felt that there was something missing and didn't think that guacamole smeared on top of corn tortillas with a little sauce was a gerat meal idea. I could definatley see his point. Although I had no qualms making a meal of it my girls hardly touched it. I really can't see myself making an entree out of this dish either mainly because I think the key to this dish being successful is completely reliant on who you're serving it to. If you love avacado and are perfectly happy with a simple light dish than I would recommend it.",
