If using the frozen ground turkey in the tube I have a tip for you. Even when thawed it holds a lot more moisture than fresh ground turkey so when using that the patties are too soft to go on the grill. Stick them on a paper plate and pop them in the freezer for 20 minutes and they will stay together perfectly for you. This is a great recipe and one I recommend.",
