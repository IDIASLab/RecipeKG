Instead of coconut oil I used a half teaspoon of coconut extract added to the chocolate chips and one tablespoon on vegetable shortening that I add microwaved for two minutes. I then stirred them together with the coconut extract added after microwaving. I also found the dipping amount short and made a half batch again. Again thank you for this as my mother in law used to make something similar years ago and I lost the recipe.",
