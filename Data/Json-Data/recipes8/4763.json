After the soup simmered for 45 minutes, I took half out and blended it until smooth, added it back to the soup pot and simmered for another 10 minutes. This just helps to get more mushroom flavor in to the soup, while still keeping chunks of mushrooms. It also helps to thicken the soup a little, which is a little thin for cream of mushroom. The recipe is 5 stars even without those changes, I was just in the mood for a stronger mushroom flavor.",

As far as changes, I halved the amount of butter, and substituted it for bacon fat, and left out the sherry.",
