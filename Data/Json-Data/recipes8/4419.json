I could see the muffin sides were getting pretty brown, so I took them out of the oven.  The center was just slightly underdone, but that really wasn\u2019t a major issue.  They taste very chocolatey, I just wish they looked more chocolatey (eye appeal not great IMO).  Texture is somewhere between a muffin and cup cake, and they are very moist, tender, and most important,  tasty.",

I might add a little more cheese or combine ingredients differently next time. Also the recipe called for lightly beaten eggs been then read to add one at a time. Little difficult to separate when already beaten. I will try again, but with adjustments. Thinking I might add some cinnamon to enhance the flavor a bit as  all I could taste was the chocolate chips.",
