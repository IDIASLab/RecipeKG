Cut up boneless chicken breast into 1\" pieces. I did put everything into a Ziploc bag to marinate---I was thinking I might just do everything on the sheet pan, but am glad I did the bag. Was easy and could really tumble everything around to get coated with the spices and oil. I did not have any cilantro or lime and didn't miss it---although I do love cilantro! Cooked as stated---no one was ready for dinner yet and had to keep hot in oven for about an extra 15 minutes...and didn't seem to hurt the dish. Very good! Served in flour tortillas with avocado, sour cream, cheddar and hot sauce with a side of rice and beans.",

One pan was for the chicken which I marinated for 6 hours(used 6 chicken breast sliced thin with the full amount of spices) . Also didn't use the full amount of oil.. Just drizzled in some olive oil. I marinated the onions, and 2 red bell peppers for 2 hours with only a drizzle of olive oil and full amount of spices. When ready to cook I planced them on their own baking sheet along with some sliced mushrooms (approx 3 Cups). The Lime really makes everything pop.. I'm a huge sucker for Lime so didn't measure that. Served Mine in a whole grain wrap with some Avacado. Will definitely make this again. My only suggestion is for people that like a lot of flavor definitely double spices, and no need for that much oil.. Just drizzle.",
