My boyfriend and the boys at work (it made heaps of leftovers!) really liked it but I had to make A LOT of changes. \r\nI added just 2 tablespoons of ketchup and a sprinkling of brown sugar as they are both very sweet. The sauce in the can of baked beans is also sweet so you can imagine how sickly it tasted. I then added some garlic, tomato paste. tobascco sauce, chili powder & thyme which took some of the sweetness away. It sure did need all this extra flavour. I also just let it simmer on the stove top rather than finish it off in the over. With these changes it makes nice Sunday 'mince on toast' but that's about it.",
