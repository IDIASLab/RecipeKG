I like using El Pato brand Mexican style hot tomato sauce and instead of jack cheese I always use Mexican cotija or queso fresco cheeses(Cacique Brand or El Mexicano Brand) (my mom would kill me if I dared to Americanize chilaquiles!  She'd consider it sinful!)  I also use crema fresca which is a Mexican style fresh cream that gives Mexican dishes a unique cool taste.  You can usually find these in the cheese aile where you find all the Mexican cheeses.",

All green sauce with boiled shredded chicken all red sauce with ground beef in layers for an lasagna type meal. This is traditionally served with the egg fried and laid on top of the mixture which is another option. Always a hit and very easy.",

I bet it'd be great with corn tortillas. Had it for dinner and it was enough to fill! Bet it would be a great Sunday brunch where you expect your meal to hold you til dinner. UPDATE: I cut up the tortillas and sprayed both sides with cooking spray then baked them for 15 minutes at 400 degrees and they tasted the same as fried but healthier!",

Then, I sauteed the onions in a pan until tender and then added the eggs to the same pan and cooked until firm.  I did NOT add the tortilla strips to the pan with the eggs and onions, rather I put some tortilla strips on each plate, topped with eggs/onion mixture then enchilada sauce and then the cheese.  Oh, and I added a dollop of sour cream.  Not the quickest breakfast but great for a hangover!  (Really)  ",

First of all I read the recipe and thought \"The proportions are all wrong.\" Thirty (30!) tortillas vs. six eggs?? Uh-uh. But not having made chilaquiles before I followed the recipe faithfully (except for the cheese adding cotija instead of Monterey Jack). I used a 12\" cast iron skillet but there's no way it could even come close to holding the 30 tortillas. I got maybe 20 in there. With that the tortillas overwhelmed the eggs. If I made again (doubtful) I would have a dozen eggs and 10 tortillas. 1/2 cup of water and the enchilada sauce was not enough to cook down the tortillas either. I added more water but that even wasn't enough. Not sure why this has gotten such rave reviews. Nothing close to the wonderful chilaquiles I've had in restaurants before. Too bad--was WAY looking forward to it.",
