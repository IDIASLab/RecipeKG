At first glance, it seems like a lot of work, but it was actually rather easy to execute.  Someone else complained about ti being a bit runny....just remember to drain the beans before putting them in the food processor ;)  I didn't add any extra water to the beans, just what was packed in the cans with them, ( so that probably helped) and just added a bit of that in to keep the mash from coming out too dry.  They came out looking, and smelling delicious, and were a big hit.  Probably should have made more, judging by they way they disappeared.",
