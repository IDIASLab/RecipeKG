I only had canola oil so I used that but to be fair the recipe submitter says they taste way better when frying them in peanut oil which I had none of so I just went w/ what I had and they were fine. I only had a few artichokes to use up so I made a small batch. These would be wonderful w/ some sort of dipping sauce. I plan to try these again using peanut oil to fry and making a sauce for dipping. Thanks for sharing.:)",
