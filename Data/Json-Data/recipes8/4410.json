I also really liked it topped with sour cream mixed with maple syrup instead of whipped cream. Mmmmm. I just printed and added this to \"my family's favorite recipe binder.\" Thanks for this recipe!",

Was hesitant to try it because it seemed way too simple, but I will probably never use another recipe for shortcake.  Made it exatly as written, as other reviewers mentioned did have to bake about 10 minutes longer.  I cut the cake into 8 pie shaped wedges which I cut in half horizontally.  Mashed some berries with a little truvia to make a \"sauce\" and then sliced the remaining berries with no sugar.  I didn't use whipped cream and instead put a small dollop of plain greek yogurt on the top.  Divine!",

For me and hubs, it lacked in the flavor department even after the fact I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  It just wasn't sweet enough.  With that said, this recipe is as close as I have found to being a good shortcake base.  It definitely beats the store bought spongy cakes.  I'll try it with butter next time and see if that makes a difference.  As for the bake time, it was definitely understated in the recipe as others have noted.  It required an additional 15 minutes to yield a beautiful cake.",
