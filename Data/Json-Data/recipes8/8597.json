I decided to use the sweet potato instead of regular potatoes, and was delightfully surprised by the wonderful flavor blend it created with the sweetness of the onions, garlic, and Adzuki beans. I also wanted to try escarole in a soup, and the result was fantastic. Adzuki beans are found in any health food or specialty store, and in many national grocery chains. They have a great nutty, slightly sweet taste, and are especially tasty added to chicken soups of any kind.",

I used boneless skinless chicken breast instead of thighs brown jasmine rice instead of wild rice part of a pattypan squash instead of the zucchini and spinach instead of escarole. I had bought some adzuki beans from the bulk section of my grocery store because I thought they were beautiful beans so then I had to find a recipe to use them in. The flavor of this is incredible! I thought for sure I would need to add salt but the herbs combined with the slight saltiness of the broth made the flavor perfect. I researched the nutritional value of adzuki beans and they're amazingly good for you! I'll definitely buy more and make this again on multiple occasions. Thank you for sharing!",
