The flavor was really good but I felt like it might need an extra little something the next time I make it. I'm thinking maybe some finely diced jalapeno or a sprinkle of cayenne or chili powder. We really enjoyed the tangy avocado in the bottom of the glass. It went well with the sweet fruit. The cilantro really makes it and so do the pickled onions so don't skip! I will make this next time I have a dinner party.",
