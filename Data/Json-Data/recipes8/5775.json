Keeping it simple yet full of flavor with VERY few calories. I have made this 3 times now for a guilt-free breakfast drink. There are many bags of frozen cranberries in my freezer so I see a few more of these in our future. Thanks Linda (LTM) for sharing. I love taking a tall insulated glass of this smoothie to school with me. It stays nice and icy for a long time. Sooo delicious!",
