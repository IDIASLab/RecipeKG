I think the key to making this salad work well is to use only the best farm-fresh vegetables and to mix the minced garlic basalmic vinegar and olive oil well before mixing it with the vegetables. I used a green pepper as I didn't have a red one. I definitely will make this recipe again - especially when I have an excess bounty of fresh corn on the cob.",
