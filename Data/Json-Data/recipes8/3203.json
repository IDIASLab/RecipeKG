This is a delicious brunch dish where eggs are poached in salsa, served on corn tortillas, and topped with cheese, sour cream, and black olives. This recipe would also be good with fresh avocado or guacamole. If you use gluten-free tortillas, which are easy to find, it would be gluten free. Hold the cheese and sour cream and it is dairy free!",
