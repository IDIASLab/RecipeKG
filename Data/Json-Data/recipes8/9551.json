Every member of the family and all of our guests kept raving about it and have either asked for the recipe or asked me to make it again.  It was especially wonderful as we had vegetarian guests, and serving this family style in separate dishes (lettuce, chicken, potatoes, Greek salad components, and dressing) with a side of garlic bread to help bulk it out just a little more for the vegetarians in the party made this a wonderful dish we could all share!  I didn\u2019t change a thing except to set some of the marinade aside for coating the potatoes of the non-meat-eaters and baking said potatoes on a separate pan sheet.  Yes, the potatoes cooked in with the chicken taste WAY better, but this was an easy accommodation to make for them and still tasted delicious!  Thank you once again, Chef John!",
