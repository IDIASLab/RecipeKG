I like the other suggestion using broth insetad of water - and I also like using dry hominy instead of canned if you have the time - don't add peppers or salty spices if you are preparing for dry - but a bit of garlic, Cumin and some dried coriander gives the hominy a great flavour.  And then you can top it off in the final preparation with fresh coriander and as much pepper as you like - Poblanos give a nice smokey flavour and if you mash a bit of harmony it thickens the broth.",

I served the pork/hominy mixture in bowls and served the tortillas cabbage limes sour cream and arbol mixture on the side. We took the pork/hominy out of the bowls and made tacos then the broth was like a dipping sauce. I would give this recipe 6 stars if it were possible! For those who say that this recipe has no flavor you must have done something wrong. Don't skip the arbols it's a must! Thank you for a lovely recipe!!",
