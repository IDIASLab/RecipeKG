I blended a can of diced, fire roasted tomatoes with the refried beans to apply easier, then brown rice. I put a couple tbsp of olive oil in pan and cooked a small onion, half a seeded poblano pepper and 2 large cloves of garlic until soft (about 4 mins). I then added Seitan and tsp of cumin, sprinkle of oregano, salt, pepper, and 2 Tbls of ground medium-hot, New Mexican red chili. Let that cook for about 4 minutes and took off heat. I added this to the layers (total of two tortilla) ending with top showing the Seitan and then the cheese. I used all ingredients plus added some healthy, yummy ones. It was awesome!!! and made enough for 8-10 people.",

But for a quick tasty dinner for 6, I will keep this recipe.  I did follow the instructions fairly close.  I used petite diced salt free tomatoes instead of crushed.  I mixed with a whole can of medium spiced Ro*TEL.  I chopped the Seitan into bite size pieces.  The rice I cooked in veggie broth.  I used  Good Planet brand mozzarella.  Also the green enchilada sauce I used 28oz can of medium spice.\nThe basics are here!  Make it your spice level!\nMy husband felt it needed more crunch...I handed him a bag of tortilla chips!
