Fruit and chocolate is a good combination.  I used all strawberries and substituted M&M baking bits for the white chocolate chips, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  People who tried them all said they were yummy, but one person asked if it was some sort of banana bread, so clearly the texture confuses people.\n\nThey kept all right in the fridge for a week, but maintained the soggy consistency.  From day one, bits were crumbling off the bars.  If I make this again, I might skip cutting it into bars and just serve it in slices or wedges with a fork.",
