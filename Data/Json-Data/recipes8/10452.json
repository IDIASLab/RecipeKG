        "description": "A few years ago, I was rustling through Grandma Clara's recipe box, looking for some inspiration. Grandma's version of \"Carrot Cookies\" was good, but the recipe needed more color, texture, and zip. The original recipe called for cooking the carrots, which seemed to diminish the carrot flavor. So I used fresh carrot garnishes on top to finish, which makes them bright and colorful for parties and holidays. A bit of flake salt is nice, too.",
