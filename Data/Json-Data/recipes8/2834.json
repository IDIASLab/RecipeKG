Your red chile sauce should be made out of 16 dried red chile pods (minus seeds and ends) -- hydrated with water until plump (2-3 hrs)-use the water from hydration bowl (4 cups to 16 pods)  and blended with 1/2 tsp cumin,1 Tbl sp flour,1 Tbl spn garlic, pinch of mexican oregano and salt to taste..then you would need to blend it in the blender for 5 minutes and use something to take the bitter chile peeling from the chile sauce - I use a flour sifter. Cook on stovetop with a little bit of lard or olive oil at medium heat until it thickens. That will be used for your red chile sauce instead of your chili powder or canned enchilada sauce.. good luck!!",
