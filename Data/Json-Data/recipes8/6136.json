When we ate them the chicken was pasty on the inside.  I think it was because the enzyme in the fresh pineapple ate away at the chicken all night.  I would recommend marinating the chicken and the pineapple in separate containers and then putting on skewers at the last minute if you are using fresh pinapple.  Otherwise it was delicious.",

Ruined the barcecue and we had to throw away 200 dollars in food.  If you try this recipe make sure to only marinate it for 2 hours at most.  I have marinated chicken over night over 100 times and never had a problem.  I don't know if it is because the pieces are cubed or the marinate isn't good but using fresh pineapple and ingredients, following this to a tee, I wasted a ton of time and it was a disaster.  I wish I knew what went wrong.  I am thinking that protein and pineapple do NOT belong marinated together for a long time.  Recipe says \"at least 2 hours\" I wouldn't go 1 minute over and cross your fingers...",
