His wife was born in Spain, she served this for dinner, and that\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve had it.  Two things come to mind, hers was chunkier, and it was served with a fried egg on the top.  The recipe calls for \u201cfinely sliced onions,\u201d so I used my mandolin, and I would NEVER cut them that thinly again.  They ended up looking like a string, and there just wasn\u2019t anything to bite into.  And they just looked a bit messy (sorry, but they did).  This could be personal preference, but I would have liked the potatoes browned more, so next time,  I\u2019ll give them a few minutes in the skillet before the peppers go in.  I did add a splash of red wine vinegar which brightened the flavor, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.  I enjoyed it, my hubby not so much, but he\u2019s a carnivore anywat!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
