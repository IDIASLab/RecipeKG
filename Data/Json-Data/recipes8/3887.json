Personally, I feel that 'buttercream' should have at least one of those two ingredients in it...it tasted like pure shortening,(and I followed the recipe to a tee) also, because it was so greasy from the shortening, I literally had to run my dishwasher 2 times to get all of the residue off of the dishes (I put the mixing bowl in the dishwasher, and everything came out greasy) On top of this, the frosting did not hold color very well- it kept seperating out...maybe it would have been better if I had used the gel color, but I probably won't make these again to see...to the reviewer who stated that they would be using this frosting for all of their cakes from now on, may I make a suggestion? If you like this, try \"Rick's special buttercream\" from this site...WAY BETTER, just as easy...",

This way the dough was like a rock and a little too hard to work with but I did not give up and warmed the dough up a bit and they turned out beautiful.  I made 2 batches of the dough and you can double only the powdered sugar and flavorings on the frosting part to make more frosting, obviously adding more water/milk until you and your beaters feel that it is the perfect consistency for your cookies.  You do not need to double the shortening.  Delicious cookies, perfect cutouts.  Don't let the dough scare ya!",

These sugar cookies are not too sweet, which is great if you are pairing them with royal icing. This recipe is a winner. We will use it time and time again. One note: I rolled the cookies out to about 1/4 inch thickness. I prefer a thicker cookie, this way the edges don't burn when you cook them.",

I normally don't have much luck w/rolled sugar cookies (as the dough is always the wrong consistency..) i followed the recipe to the letter & they turned out PERFECT!! Afer chilling the dough, it was rather hard (don't let that scare you though, after working w/it for a few minutes it was fine!) I am making these again today & will let the dough sit for 5 mins or so after chilling so that it's easier to work with. I did the xmas cut-outs..they turned out great..I did read the review on these & the frosting prior to making them & I personally loved the frosting that goes w/these! It was a little thick & very sweet (plus there was lots left over..) But i always like my sugar cookie frosting to be that way..To the other reviewer that said that these turned out like 'dry biscuits'...must've done something wrong or not frosted them..I'm not an 'expert' baker, just an 'average' one & these were by far 'bakery' style cookies. I will use these for lots of differrent occasions now!! So glad I found it!",
