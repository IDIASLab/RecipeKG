I added fresh garlic to the vegetable saute in place of the garlic powder and also used garlic salt. I could not see the point of sauteing the zucchini because vegetables are supposed to be cooked until they are crisp tender, not mushy. I used 1 4 oz. can of green chiles and 1 4 oz. can of green salsa since that's what I had  on hand. I also did not add flour to the (low-fat) sour cream because I didn't feel it needed it. I used a little fahita seasoning to the mix as well as some chopped cilantro. I doubled the amount of tortillas and I added shredded chicken to make it a complete meal. Each serving was topped off with some diced avocado. It turned out perfect with the exception that it was not spicy for our taste so next time I will add a diced Jalapeno or Anaheim pepper to the vegetable saute. Corn would also make a nice addition. Thanks Brandi for another delicious way to use up our summer squash.",
