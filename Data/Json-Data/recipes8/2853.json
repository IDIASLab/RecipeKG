Used chili powder (maybe 1 T?) in the beans instead of the chilies (it was all we had), and they were great.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!",

It's very filling - if you have this for a lazy Sunday breakfast you won't be hungry again until dinner! Plus you will almost need a nap after breakfast.;-) I made two changes. 1) I poached the egg to make it a little healthier. 2) I mashed up the bean mix a little bit. My beans were too liquidy but mashing them fixed the problem. My measurements may have been a little off because I adjusted the serving size to '1'. I think the egg/bean/salsa layers would be good on on top of hashbrowns too. I might try that next time if I didn't have tortillas on hand.",

I've never cooked with chipotles before (though I've eaten dishes with that flavor in restaurants so I knew I liked it) so one canned finely chopped came to a bit over a teaspoon. The rest I laid out on waxed paper to freeze (and store later) and I froze the rest of the adobo sauce in a small container. Actually in retrospect I might freeze the sauce in ice cube trays as it seems like a little bit would add nice complexity to sauces.",
