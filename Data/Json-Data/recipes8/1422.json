It gets rave reviews from our family. Light and minty, with a hint of chocolate. While this recipe is involved, it is not difficult. Keep at it and your work will pay off! Delicious results. Top with mini chocolate chips and additional Andes&reg; peppermint chips if desired. Store in a refrigerator.",
