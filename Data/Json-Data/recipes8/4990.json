I got another burn notice and again, added more liquid,  (call me determined to make this work!) and stirred and scraped the  bottom of the pot.. Finally  got it to pressure and let it do its thing.\n\nBY the time it was all finished, it had  basically turned to mush due to all my having to stir the bottom. It tasted okay, but was not pleasing to the eye.  \n\nI will try this again but will make sure I at least double the liquid.",
