I made only a couple of changes to the recipe; first I cooked the bacon in the same pot I used to make the soup, I drained most of the fat and then added the butter and made the roux. I then deglazed the pan with 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth followed by only 4 cups of milk. I think the bacon and chicken broth gave the soup great flavor. I have tried about 4 other recipes and they always come out tasting like mashed potato soup. I will most definitely make it again.",

I sauted the chopped green onions in the roux to soften them a little. I then followed the recipe until after I added the milk. I then whisked approx 1/2 cup of flour with some heavy cream in a separate bowl. I slowly added this to the the soup and stirred constantly. I then poured about another cup of heavy cream to the soup. This made it thicker than the original recipe made and hearty too. Let me tell you it was a HIT!!! My husband went to chef school for 3 years and LOVED it. I then took some to work the next day and my staff loved it as well. This is definitely a keeper!!!!!",

The best suggestion is to \"truly\" bake the potatoes. I also decided to some of the bacon fat in the roux for more flavor. I did not serve the same day but rather chose to refrigerate overnight for flavor. This is a very thick soup therefore the next day needed to be thinned with milk/half & half but the flavor was excellent. I chopped the bacon before cooking and any lartger bits broke them prior to adding to soup. I held back some to add upon serving along with finely shredded cheddar and sour cream. This is a killer soup! Thank you.",

Don't make the mistake of adding additional flour to the roux because the soup thickens considerably when you add the potatoes. Very creamy.I made this a day ahead of time so added 2/3 green onion at that time. Added rest of gr. onion sour cream and bacon just before serving(so bacon wouldn't get mushy)the next day. (I cooked the bacon well done in the oven and chopped it medium dice although the recipe does not specify.)Garnished with grated cheddar left over green onion and a little diced tomato (for a festive look). Requires fair amount prep time with stirring soup and cooking bacon etc. but would make this again! Next time I will use at least part bacon grease in the roux to enhance the flavor.",

I just peeled and quartered my potatoes, rinsed them and threw them in the crockpot and covered them with organic chicken broth. Once they were fork-tender, I just mushed them in the crockpot with my potato masher (for a chunkier soup) and then threw the rest of the ingredients in. I did not need the flour or butter as the potatoes thickened up nicely on their own and I only used one 12 ounce can of evaporated milk, to keep the soup thick. I did not add the sour cream only because I felt like she could add that at a later date, if she decided to freeze it OR she could add it to her family's taste. For a more baked potato taste, I added sauteed green onions, chives and fresh minced garlic and I doubled the cheese. I made this for a new mom-friend of mine but her and her family loved it. Very easy and re-warms like a champ. Very bendable and quite budget friendly.",
