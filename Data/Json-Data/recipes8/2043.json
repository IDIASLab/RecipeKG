It was flowing out of the muffin trays whilst baking, and there was excess butter in the silicone molds after I took out the muffins. I'm not sure what the thought is behind using melted butter in the recipe? I will try this recipe again with 1/4 cup softened butter. I put almond pieces in the batter as opposed to doing a topping and that helped give some texture to this yogurt muffin.",
