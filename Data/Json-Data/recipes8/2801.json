It's there to add crunch, contrast of color and a bit of sweetness. I sometimes add just a handful of black beans to the salsa for color. Fresh corn cooked about 3-4 minutes in boiling water, not canned. People comment on the \"beautiful salsa\" every time. I don't use much cayenne since many can't handle hot. BUT, I take a base of sour cream, leftover cilantro, lime juice, salt, 1/2 a jalapeno, a little oil and chili powder and blend in blender. Not hot at all. Put it squirt bottle and guests can add to tacos if they like. OR take half that sauce for mild lovers and leave half to throw in a chipotle, more jalapeno, cayenne or whatever you think will be good for the spicy lovers.  I also cook my fish (tilapia) on a cast iron griddle (flat side) on the grill. Get it good and hot and cook about 2-3 mins per side. Comes out with a slightly blackened crust with all the juices sealed in. I marinate the fish in just lime juice, olive oil and some chili powder. I use flour tortillas. They hold up well.  I'm telling you, this is the way to go with this recipe.",

So, cut it at least in half (you'll still probably have too much left over). We reduced the amount of the red pepper as well and they were still too firey for our (spicy) taste. The salsa mixture is wonderful (although I couldn't finD jicama in our store). We didn't fnd the salsa dry at all because the sour cream adds a creamy taste. Toss the tortillas on the grill for a bit. YUM! This one's a keeper! :)",

Oh, I also learned an important lesson about corn tortillas tonight - when the recipe says to use two, you really do need to use two. I made the first taco with one, and it ended up disintegrating on to the counter... Good recipe though. Thanks!",
