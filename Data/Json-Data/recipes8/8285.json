I always find my beans thicken that way.\nI also opened up hot dog buns on the plate, and scooped the mixture over it.  Almost like a sloppy joe.",

I did NOT add 2 cups of sugar as that would have been WAY too sweet and no white sugar. Just 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it was plenty sweet. As is this recipe would get 2 or 3 stars with that ridiculous amount of sugar... Cookies have less sugar than that! Also it was too thin. The guys and kids loved it and kept going for more... Some of the women were afraid to try it though! I would make it again for another kids party not for dinner though!",
