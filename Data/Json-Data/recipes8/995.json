I will definitely make these donuts again. I added an extra T. of milk because the batter was thick. The recipe stated it made 11 donuts. I had enough batter to make 12 donuts and 2 small tart pans, (I baked the tarts for 10 minutes.) I have Wilton donut pans, maybe the pans are smaller than other brands. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the tarts comes out clean. I would suggest sifting the powdered sugar and using a mixer to mix the glaze. Sifting the powdered sugar helps prevent lumpy glaze. I also had to add 2 T. of milk to thin the glaze. I might not need more milk if I would of used a spoon to add the powdered sugar to the measuring cup.",
