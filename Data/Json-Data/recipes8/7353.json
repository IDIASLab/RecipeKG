In their place I used a Granny Smith apple cored chopped and sausage cooked (2 chorizos patties) a little bit of very finely crushed bread crumbs mixed in with both along with the cream cheese old sharp shredded cheddar cheese.. My son opened the tenderloin up so I could put the stuffing in all of the opened area. I then carefully rolled it like a jelly roll and tied it closed. I lightly seasoned the outside with seasoned salt pepper and applewood smoke seasoning by Clubhouse. Cooked it for exactly 2 hours and it turned out perfectly I even did roasted potatoes carrots and onion with it and used the juice from the meat before hand to make gravy as there was lots.",
