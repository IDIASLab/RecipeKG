                "reviewBody": "Well this was totally hard to rate. I looked at this recipe a few times before deciding to make and seriously read all the reviews. I started out with the 1:1cup ratio water and sugar the 1/4 lime juice and I hard packed my watermelon in the measurements of 4 cups. I strained the pulp because my watermelon had seeds. I found that my melon was not that sweet...And the lime juice over powered the watermelon flavor. So I had to increase another 1:1cup water and sugar. Still tasted lime juice above the watermelon. So I added another 1:1cup water and sugar and then it wasn't sweet with watermelon flavor....Bottom line was this. I did the exact recipe but I ended up increasing the watermelon to 8 cups of packed watermelon to get the desired flavor. I think if your watermelon is to sweet then adjust(decrease) your simple syrup ratio to accomendate if your melon was like mine you'll have to increase. This recipe is one you need to watch soley because of the watermelon. If I had realized my melon wasn't sweet I would have just decreased the lime juice. My kids liked it but my son said he liked it better as juice then frozen. I thought it was spot on the watermelon flavor when the recipe was done but I would totally wait 24 hours before serving to make sure it's nice and firm. It melts way to quickly after a couple of hours and that was after I used an ice cream maker.",

Just an addition--I bought two large watermelons at the end of last summer made the simple syrup and added the blended watermelon. Then I froze it in one quart containers (the same size as my ice cream machine). We were able to have watermelon sorbet in the middle of winter simply by thawing the mixture and placing it in the ice cream machine and preceding with the recipe as follows. Made my first batch for this summer today and my hubs is a very happy man.",

I used one cup of simple syrup and almost five cups of watermelon and it's still pretty sweet but also really refreshing. I didn't use an ice cream maker just poured the mixture into a shallow dish and froze it. Then once it's frozen you can either scrape it with a fork or put it in a food processor. (Keep in mind that it melts very quickly.) Also after combining the watermelon pulp with the simple syrup and lime juice I pressed it through a sieve to get rid of the solids. Because even though the watermelons say they're 'seedless' they still have those pesky white seeds that would make for an unappetizing final product.",
