Using the broiler for these boneless, skinless chicken thighs only takes a few minutes, inside my air-conditioned kitchen, and gives the chicken a lovely char. We like Mexican flavors, so these can be sliced and used as fajitas, or as a soft chicken taco. I used them whole, as a main dish, to go along with Southwestern Veggie Skillet, on the Allrecipes site, and Mexican rice. Garnish with fresh cilantro or flat-leaf parsley.",
