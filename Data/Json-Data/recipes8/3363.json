Try adding a few ounces of cream cheese (we use 4-5) into the cheese mixture.  Also, we use Almond extract.  My grandmother would use vanila as a substitute, but almond gives it a really nice flavor.  Then, try topping it with cherry or blueberry pie filling.  Yum yum.  I'm eating some right now!",

In our family it is always served cold with whipped cream or Cool Whip and sugared strawberries on top. It's sort of an Italian pound cake...",
