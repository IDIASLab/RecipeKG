My husband wasn't hungry due to a late lunch and said he'd have \"a taste.\"  He's now eating his second serving.  The recipe didn't say if the olives & chilies should be drained; I drained the former but not the latter.  I thought 12 tortillas might be too many and only used 8; won't make that mistake again :-)  My only criticism is it wasn't as spicy as I like, so next time I'll add more chipotle.",
