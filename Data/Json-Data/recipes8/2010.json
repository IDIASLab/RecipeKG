Warm and hot water are not good descriptions. If you add too cool or too hot of water to your yeast, it will die. You need water between 110-115. I added hot water from a water kettle to the flour mixture. I needed about 1/4 cup more flour for the dough because it was way too wet. This needs a frosting of some sort because otherwise it will be too dry. I added a cream cheese frosting I made from scratch. Lastly, bake these in a greased 9 by 13 pyrex dish, not a cookie sheet. That way you can put a lid on it and it will be ready to go. So many problems with this recipe.",
