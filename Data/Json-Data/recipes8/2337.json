Also as none of us like pine nut's used almond flake's 1st time and roughly chopped Macadame nut the following. All give a great flavour so you can use these if you wish. This must be prepared and serve'd as quick as can be. Watermelon has a high water content so isn't something that can be ( apart from the making's of the rest of the ingred.) mixed in and kept before serving. Have it ready and just throw it all together. It is a bit of fun. Tastes yummy and fresh. Great for summer. Will make this again and again.",

It looks a tad sauce-heavy in the pan and I thought there was no way the watermelon would blend with these flavors but the sweetness of the watermelon and ginger compliment the hoisin and soy sauce beautifully. Very refreshing and unique! If you don't have lettuce wraps just serve over plain brown rice. We reheated some leftovers the next day and it doesn't taste QUITE as fresh but it's still pretty darn good. I'll try it with ground chicken next. I highly recommend this straightforward and unique dish!",

Doing this infuses the meat with the garlic and ginger flavors but the main point is to avoid over-cooking the garlic which becomes bitter with over-cooking. This is very similar to another recipe I have but this one is quicker and every bit as good. I was going to ignore the watermelon but because I had one sitting on the counter decided to give it a go. Glad I did. In future when watermelon is in season I'll use this recipe again. Didn't use the pine nuts - not wild about them.",

It turns out to be a perfect flavor and texture combination! I made the recipe exactly as written and the only change I made was to leave the watermelon separate for leftover storage purposes which probably worked out for the best. I simply tossed the watermelon with the rest of the mix once in the lettuce cup. My husband was hesitant to try the watermelon did try it and liked it but said he would prefer water chestnuts. Water chestnuts would be delicious too but the sweetness of the watermelon is too perfect to substitute! Great for a meal or just as an appetizer! A bit labor intensive but definitely an impressive outcome!",
