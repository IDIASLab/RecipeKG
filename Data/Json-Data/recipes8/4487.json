I loved the idea of this using orange juice paired with lime. I even added a bit of orange and lime zest to heighten the citrus flavor. It's mildly sweet and does have some citrus flavor but in the end the heat from the red pepper flakes prevailed....",

Putting a lid over the marinaded chicken kept the flavors in and I added additional salt and pepper for extra flavor. I decided to add mini red and orange peppers into the mix to create another level of delicious flavors. You know it's done once the chicken has a nice carmalized finish to it and the juices are all absorbed into the chicken and mini bell peppers. \n\nTrust me your taste buds won't be disappointed!!!!",

Unlike other reviewers we did not find this sweet and in fact talked about adding a bit more honey the next time. We found the citrus flavor really was highlighted but I attribute that to the 10 hr marinate time and the fact that I did used freshly juiced fruit. I think the juice combination would make a great sauce if thickened with a bit of corn starch and boiled for several minutes (or make a fresh juice combination and cook less). We will try that next time.",
