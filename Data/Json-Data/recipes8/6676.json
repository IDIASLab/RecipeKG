I went with the recipe the first time I made this and discovered that we did not care for the taste that the peppers gave. So the second time I made it I left them and added extra zucchini and squash. I also did not add the onions but used onion powder. Again because of personal preference/picky eaters. The zucchini and squash really take in the flavor of the garlic when you are cooking it in the olive oil so don't skip that part! We used a home made pasta sauce recipe instead of the chuncky sauce (not a fan). Whats great is that its so easy to make a second batch to freeze for later! Good stuff thanks!!",

I added 1up of low fat ricotta & 1/3 cup parmesan cheese to the mixture when blending it all together prior to baking.  You can reduce the mozzarella topping if you want a trade off.  What is particularly nice is that this freezes well.  We freeze leftovers in individual portion sizes with our Food Saver.  Just defrost & reheat in the microwave or a warm oven - it'll save you $$ on fast food alternatives for those nights you're too tired for kitchen wizardry.
