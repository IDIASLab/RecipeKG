The only thing I changed was mincing the celery and mushrooms, and I only added one can of evaporated milk. Great combo with the fish especially for those who don't like chewing on rubbery clams. I am from the Pacific Northwest and we have a lot of famous chowder houses up here. A trick I learned when searving chowder is to put a bit of butter and a sprinkle of pepper on top. (Thought I would pass it on) This chowder is already very rich and creamy so I am eating it just the way it is. I saw a lot of comments stating this is a bland chowder and I did not find it so. I put in a lot of pepper cause that is the way I like chowder, so maybe give that a try. We had garlic sticks with ours and it made a great meal!",

I used 1lb red snapper, 1lb cooked baby shrimp and some chopped clams.  I had lots of clam juice, so I used 4 cups clam juice to 1 cup chicken broth.  I also used half and half rather than evaporated milk and found that 16oz was enough.  Used Lawry's great garlic salt with parsley and lots more Old Bay's to taste.

It looks like a lot but they reduce in size after cooking.  I used 1 lb of cod, 1/2 lb of bay scallops, 1 lb of shrimp and 2 cans of minced clams. Instead of buying a separate bottle of clam juice, I saved the juice from the canned clams and mixed it with the flour.  Two cans will give you one cup of juice. The variety of seafood added great flavor!  I also used a full tablespoon of the Old Bay seasoning which I thought was perfect!  I also took other reviewers suggestions and used one can of creamed corn and used 1 cup of half & half in place of the evaporated milk.  My family absolutely loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe.",
