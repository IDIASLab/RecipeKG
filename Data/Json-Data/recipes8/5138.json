I did change just a couple of things.  One, I left out the onion as neither my husband or myself can eat them..and it was n't missed.  Also, instead of using pickle juice and the sweet pickle, I used sweet relish.  I did increase the dressing half again, as we do not like a dry macaroni salad, and this did not get dry.  I made it the day before, and yes, it tastes better the second day after the ingredients have had a chance to sit and blend.  I put the carrots through my food processor and they were perfect for this salad.  And one little tip.  When using celery seed, rub the seeds between your palms to crush them a little.  This releases not only the aroma, but the flavor as well. Oh, and if you are making a dish that requires both onion and celery, cut the celery last, and rub some leaves, or even part of the rib on your hands.  It will remove the onion.",

After tasting I felt it needed a little sweetener so I added  1T honey.  I used red pepper because I prefer it to green pepper and it really added to the variety of colors.  I did not have celery seed so I omitted.  This was delicious. My husband loved it and he is a macaroni salad lover!  I was so worried he wouldn't care for it and he just loved it! Thank you.",
