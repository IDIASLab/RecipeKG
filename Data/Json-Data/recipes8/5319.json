But here no one complained quite the contrary. I saut\u00e9ed the squash with the onion too. I used a pressure cooker to speed things up and needed to add more broth in the end because it was so thick. I do believe this is why the amount of cayenne wasn't a problem. I garnished with avocado and smoked paprika. Thank you for this keeper recipe.",
