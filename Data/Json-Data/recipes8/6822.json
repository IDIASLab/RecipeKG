The meatballs were quite soft, so I think next time I would use dried breadcrumb instead of fresh.  The cookie sheet/baking rack thing made sense so that any drippings from the meatballs sludged off, but it is not a necessary step and you could just cook them directly on a cookie that is sprayed with non-stick spray.  Ground turkey is not too expensive and low-fat, so I try to use it as a substitute for ground beef.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!",

I might cut it by half next time and maybe use fresh  minced onion and  garlic instead of the powder form.\n I wanted this to be more like a soup, so I used the whole carton of broth and couple more cups of water. It made a nice meal for us with some garlic bread.",
