I made up the salsa mix an hour before serving, using red onion (since the recipe didn't state a preference).  It was very tasty.  I would make this again in a heartbeat!  Thanks, WHIRLEDPEAS!",

Example: Instead of getting tomatoes garlic and onion you can mix your fav salsa with the avocado & cilantro & then drizzle with the lime juice. Also you can crisp the tortillas in the oven (which then makes it a tostada) & to the black beans add some white shredded cheese such as Monterrey Jack cheese. It can be a bit messy if you are not use to tostadas but practice makes perfect.:)",
