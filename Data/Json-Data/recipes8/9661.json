I used 16-20/pound large shrimp and, wanting to make sure they were cooked completely, I increased the cooking time to 5 minutes, flipped them and cooked an additional 4 minutes.  Other than that I used the exact recipe as written.    Incredibly crunchy on the outside\u2026..thanks for submitting this gem of a recipe Nicole!  I will most definitely be making this again and again!",
