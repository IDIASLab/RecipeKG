It appears to be a lot like another recipe however this is the perfect combination of creamy and smooth. There s a hint of cinnamon making it rather mysterious.

I still can t get over the perfect taste of the crumb topping with the creamy smooth muffin and liquid popping blueberries. I wouldn t change a thing.",
