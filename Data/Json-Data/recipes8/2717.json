I actually wish it had more avocado so I added 2 instead of 1 1/2.  I also added a dollop of sour cream at the end and it gave the soup a nice rich flavor.  Will definetly make this again.",

It was just waaay too sour and tangy for us. I took some of the leftovers and poured off most of the tangy broth and replaced it with plain chicken broth. I then topped it with shredded Monterey Jack and some thin crushed tortilla chips. It was much improved but still probably not a soup I would make again. Sorry.",

This has become a staple for me, and I have developed a few variations- first, I usually double the avocado and tomato for a heartier soup; sometimes I add sour cream.  For a vegetarian version I eliminate the chicken and substitute vegetable broth, and add ground cumin, corn and black beans (canned works fine, one can each, rinsed and drained). The soup is beautiful and spicy, perfect for a light summer meal with fresh garden tomatoes, or as a colorful and spicy winter treat.",

My sister doesn't like cilantro and my dad doesn't like avocado so rather than add them to the soup i added them to individual bowls and everyone could have as much as they liked of each. I wasn't going to toast the tortilla strips 'cause i figured they'd just get soggy anyway (so what's the point?) But since i was preheating the oven for something else i did it anyway. I'm glad i did because the next day i just threw some torilla strips in with the left overs and they were a whole different kind of soggy! tortilla mush. Definately toast them first.:) I also added corn for a little more color and a tad less garlic. I threw in some more spices toward the end for more flavor to make up for slightly less jalapeno. (I didn't want to kill everyone with the ammount called for in this recipe!) It could have used more chicken for our tastes as well but totally a keeper. Very easy to modify! The lime was excellent i could have used more. I served this with cuban black beans best spanish rice and ultimate frozen strawberry margaritas. What a hit!",
