The directions to making the pancakes were easy enough to follow until I got to actually making them.  The recipe says to pour about 2/3 cup of batter for each pancake.  I started to do that until I realized that I would have only gotten a couple of pancakes from this and that they would have been way too big to even begin to turn!  I cut them to 1/3 cup of batter, but if I were to make these again, I'd even make it 1/4 cup of batter.  As it was with the 1/3 cup, I only got 5 and 1/2 pancakes---for the 8 servings I should have been able to get.  I couldn't make the frosting drizzle, so I put that into a bag, too, and the results weren't very pretty.  But I have to say that my eaters inhaled the results, and that's all that really matters, isn't it?!  Thanks for making me look like a hero, squeeziebrb!",

But when making them for myself (and let's be honest, the dog may have helped a little), I couldn't bring myself to make the whole enchilada. I halved the recipe for the cinnamon mixture and the frosting. I made silver dollar sized pancakes (2Tbs batter) and had enough drizzle to make 8. My tip is to turn down your griddle a little lower than you normally would. The longer the cinnamon swirl sits on top, the less that leaks out all over the griddle when you flip.",

When I added the butter/sugar mix it just seemed to leak out but it also kinda made the pancake a bit soggy. It took a really long time to get it crispy but then it would start to burn on the griddle. So half way through I just cooked the pancakes as normal and then spread the sugar cinnamon like butter on the pancakes and then drizzled the powder sugar frosting (I just used milk,vanilla, and p. Sugar).  Family tried it both ways and seemed to like it better the second way so save yourself some extra effort and add it at the end.",
