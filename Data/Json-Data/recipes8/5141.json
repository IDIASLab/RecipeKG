My husband ate over white rice. I had over red beans and rice (leftovers). Added 2-27-03:I've made this a few times now and have noticed each time when you add the potatoes it loses quite a bit of flavor. I now add extra spices WHEN I make with the potatoes. When I serve over rice beans etc. I simply omit the potatoes.Also we did not like the flavor of the capers when used.To our taste the capers really changed the flavor (to \"sour\" instead of nice and \"tangy\"). Will make again WITHOUT the capers.\"",
