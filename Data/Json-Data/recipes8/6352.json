In the future, I will halve the bacon strip instead of cutting into thirds.  On some, the bacon barely wrapped around, and when cooked they came apart, so I think a larger piece of bacon will work better (at least for me).  As far as flavor, they were absolutely delicious.  The dressing I used was Ken\u2019s Steak House Lite Asian Sesame with Ginger & Soy, and it worked well with the pineapple and bacon.  It worked so well that I ended up pouring some into small dishes, to use as a dipping sauce.  Don\u2019t skip the water chestnuts, that little bit of crunch adds some texture and interest.  You can prep these early in the day, bake later, and serve a nice warm appetizer with minimal effort.  I served these to a group of six people, and each and every person gave it a thumbs up.  I\u2019m giving it a 4-star rating only because I believe the oven temperature is off.  Barbara, thanks for sharing this easy appetizer which has nice presentation.",

I like my bacon crispy so it seemed the higher temp worked better. I baked these on a cookie cooling rack which allowed the grease to drain and make it easy to flip them over since there was very little surface area to stick on. I used the Sesame dressing because I had it on hand but it would have been fine without it too. The pineapple was a nice easy addition that got a lot of compliments.",

Like others I also cooked mine at 425 because that's the same temp I cook bacon in the oven. An important rick to choosing pineapple is make sure it's a nice orange color. Green pineapples are far from ripe and like a green tomato may turn color after being picked but the ripening and flavor development process stops at that point. If I made these for a gathering I would definitely double the recipe.",

The prep time was easily doubled between cutting the fresh pineapple and wrapping greasy bacon around slippery pineapple. The cook time increased from 20 to 35 minutes with the time it took to flip and baste them and 5 extra minutes in the oven. The bacon never browned which was a huge disappointment even after I increased the oven temp to 400 for the last 20 minutes. If I were to try this again I would increase the temp to 425.",

I also cooked at 425 due to comments about the bacon not cooking quickly. I used 1/3 a slice of bacon for each piece but I had a problem with some of them coming apart. I think the bacon may have come apart where it was very fatty. At any rate this was a hit and they were all eaten quickly! I bought pre-cut pineapple (fresh but cut by the store) to save time. One suggestion I would make is to make sure the pineapple pieces are small enough to cover with the water chestnut and wrap in bacon. Some of my chunks were perhaps a little too large and I stretched the bacon. I think next time I will try with turkey bacon but I will definitely make them again.",
