I contacted the editors but I guess they couldn't change the recipe in their system. Here's the basic rule of thumb ... you always want to have twice as much coconut oil as you have agave nectar. Otherwise it *will* burn. Those reviews are right if they followed the recipe as posted here. Other oils could be used, but coconut has a very high smoke point and is a very stable oil so it's definitely the best choice for oils. ",

I was a little scared during the cooking process but it turned out fine. Guess what? My mouth might be on fire. Way way way too much chili powder. I might try this again because I just love the concept but I'd cut the chili powder down to 1-2 tsp if that. Yeowch! Also I used vegetable oil.",

I don't usually write harsh reviews but this one left me with a ridiculous inedible mess that is going to be a nightmare to clean. I think there must be an easier way because off the bat the combination of ingredients sounds really good. My thoughts are that you should probably pop the popcorn in coconut oil alone and then toss it in a mixture of coconut oil agave and chipotle pepper. When you consider this recipe process logically sugar caramelizes and eventually burns when heat is applied. The directions seem to be all wrong but I have yet to try out the method I suggested...lots of mess to clean up first!",
