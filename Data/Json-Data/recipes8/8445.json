Didn't have the required amount of red curry paste only about a tablespoon left.  Visually, it could use some green , or red vegetables. Smells good. I used canned sliced bamboo shoots, tough as wood. I used some salt when serving and I don't use much salt. It's good, rice cut the spiciness. I will make it again",
