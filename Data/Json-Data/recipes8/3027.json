I took the advice of another reviewer and treated whole tortillas before cutting them. I brushed oil on the tops, stacked them to get oil on the bottoms, then went through the pile again and sprinkled seasoning on them (only sprinkling both sides of the bottom). I cut the them into quarters and had to bake them in 3 batches. I used a stone jelly roll pan and found I had to bake them an average of 12 minutes in single layers. Thanks for sharing!",

I cut the tortillas into quarters after putting the oil and spices on them. Seemed easier. My only issue is...who can eat just 4 triangles as their serving size? Oh well, that's my problem, not the submitter's :)  A great little snack to use up those leftover tortillas!",
