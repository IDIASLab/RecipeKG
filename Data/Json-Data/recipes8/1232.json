If you make it with the amount it calls for you will need to add more milk because it is way to thick. If need to you can always add more. I personally went to baking and pastry school so i seen the scale of flour and knew it would be way to thick. Secondly i only made half the recipe because i wanted to try it out before my daughters birthday which is this coming week. I would for sure add just a little more sugar if you want a sweet cake though. If your looking for something not so sweet this is a good cake for you. Overall its a nice cake though.",
