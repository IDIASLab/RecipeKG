For starters; step 4 - cooking pasta? Moved to step 1 so the pasta would be cool to handle when filling. Sprayed with a little Pam so shells wouldn\u2019t stick together while I worked remaining steps. Cooked all hamburger at once vs dividing. Saut\u00e9d half onion (vs 2 TBLS) and while I kept true to the recipe using tomato sauce and oregano here, used spaghetti sauce for the bottom of my (11x17!!??) glass dish. This makes more than I expected!! Once I finished the garlic/spinach/cheese step - I folded this mixture into the beef/tomato sauce mixture & combined well so I only had one bowl in which to stuff the pasta shells. Yes, you could use fresh spinach but the frozen/squeezed dry was just as good! Covered with foil and baked for 30 min. Perfection! Delicious! Served with a side salad and breadsticks. \n\nThis made WAY more than I expected. I tried to load a photo but couldn\u2019t. Adhering to to the recipe quantities near exact - mine made enough shells for 11x17 dish! I guess I didn\u2019t count the shells when I dropped them into the boiling pasta water? Good thing we love it and are glad to have for leftovers.  Thank you!! Would make again!!",
