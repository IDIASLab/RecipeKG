When I dipped the apples in the caramel, I made sure there was no condensation on the outside of the apple (hence I wrapped them in the paper towels) and the caramel stuck to the apple better, I didn't have so much runoff and the caramel set faster. Makes less of a puddle around the bottom. if you do this, it's harder to put sprinkles on it as the caramel sets faster but I suppose if you had a plate of whatever you wanted on the outside right next to the stove, that may be easier\\faster. But this is just what I did. :)",

I added milk and water but now I think I should have added more and thinned it out a bit.:) But sticky is good. Iforgot the vanilla but will do it again this weekend. Now that I have a sense of how to do this I cannot be stopped. I will take over the world hahahahaha I did not have any sliding as noted by others and I too used wax paper.
