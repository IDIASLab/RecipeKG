As written, the recipe would NEVER fit in a broiler pan that I\u2019ve ever owned. I saut\u00e9ed onions in a 6 qt enamel cast iron Dutch oven, added potatoes  & apples (used 4 small). It was over \u00bd full at this point!  I seasoned the chicken & placed on top of potato mixture. I had this in the 400 degree oven for more than an hour and not all the potatoes were done, and the chicken wasn\u2019t browning. I turned up the oven temp to 425 convection for about 20 minutes and it finished the chicken nicely. There ended up being more liquid than I would have expected so it braised more than roasted. I\u2019ll make this again but next time may roast chicken separately to avoid all the juice. My picky eaters even liked it :)",
