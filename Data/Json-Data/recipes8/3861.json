My family is adamant that this is not a chili but a soup. I agree it is too brothy to be a chili. It was good and 4 out of 5 of my family members ate it without major complaint. I will say to go with the brothy-ness it was not a creamy soup despite having cream cheese in it.  I think adjusting the broth would fix this problem.",
