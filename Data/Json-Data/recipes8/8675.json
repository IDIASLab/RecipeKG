The picture is misleading in that it shows a crispy skin and the recipe states skinless. The sauce was flavorful but runny, not sticky. Everybody ate it. No complaints, but no raves either. If I make it again, it will be with major changes that render it a different recipe.  BTW, why in the world are there so many reviews by folks who have not made the recipe? It skews the rating & is a disservice to fellow cooks who want to try it. I wish Allrecipes would screen & eliminate these reviews.",

I browned the chicken first in 1 Tbls of olive oil in a cast-iron skillet, then I remove the chicken, added the butter, rosemary, 3 cloves of finely chopped garlic and 1/3 cup of honey to the pan,  stirred that around for a minute to combine, added the chicken back in and turned it in the sauce a few times  until it was well coated. Then I popped the skillet into the oven at 350\u00b0 for 30 minutes. It came out moist, beautifully browned with a nice sticky coating and very tasty. I served it with some stir fried Asian style veggies and steamed rice. Very good dinner!",
