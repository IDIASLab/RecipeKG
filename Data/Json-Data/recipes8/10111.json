A few tips, definitely cover your baking sheet with foil before making these.  I even sprayed a little cooking spray on the foil -- not sure if it helped or not.  And as other reviewers have said, stir the nuts halfway through the baking time.  Also, I found I didn't need nearly a full cup of sugar to coat the nuts at the end.  I just sprinked some on, stirred and kept adding a little sugar until I felt the nuts were coated enough.   It seems a little scary when the nuts first come out of the oven because there is a lot of gooey syrup, but just keep stirring and adding a little sugat at a tim, and the nuts will seperate well and not be sticky.",
