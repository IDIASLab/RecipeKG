Start the chicken first, so the fresh flavors of okra, corn, and tomatoes stay light and bright with only a brief simmering time at the end.  Instead of rice, you can create a complete dinner plate with a side of roasted potatoes and a crisp, green salad. Add a piece of crusty bread, in either case, for a satisfying summer meal.",

This is a light, bright , and fresh summer veggie chicken stew sure to delight your family and friends! I halved the chicken, yet kept all other ingredients as written. Since I used b/s chicken breasts, I needed to change the cooking technique somewhat, I cubed the chicken breast and sauteed that first, removed from the skillet, and then sauteed the onion and garlic separately. I tossed the chicken back into the skillet along with the rest of the ingredients, and brought to a boil, covered and turned heat to low, as instructed. Covered with the lid and cooked for 10 minutes more. Added the slurry, and when done, served over long grain rice. Fabulous summer meal, Bibi! Thank you for sharing your talent for recipe creating and your precious friendship!",
