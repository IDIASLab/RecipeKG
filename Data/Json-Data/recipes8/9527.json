        "description": "Move over corned beef, because there's a new hash in town! If you like hash, you are going to love this version made with ground beef instead of corned. Making a hash is basically a 3-step process: frying your meat and potatoes, adding onions and mushrooms, and then adding quick-cooking vegetables like peppers. But take a look in the fridge and use any ingredients you'd like because in the game of hash, whoever has the most ingredients wins! Top with a cayenne-dusted poached egg and green onions if you'd like.",

However,my mother was an expert in making Hash,so instead of cooking the hamburger, and then throwing in the potatoes all together,I use my mother's procedure, and fry the diced potatoes first and cook until they are crispy,rather then soft. After they are crisp remove them to another plate,keeping them warm,and proceed cooking the hamburger,onions,peppers,mushrooms,and seasoning as written,with the only exception of frying the potatoes first then adding them to the other ingredients once they have cooked thoroughly. By doing it this way,I get that same texture of my mother's homemade hash with the crispiness coming from the potatoes, and Chief John's professional technique. The best of both world's so yummy!",
