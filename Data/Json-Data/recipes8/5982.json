I do add salt to taste but usually don't need pepper for salsa(yes pico de gallo is a type of salsa). You should always taste along the way as you're making it so that it fits your taste.",

I also only used about 1/4 of a white onion and 3 green onions, added the juice of 2 limes, and used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder. (This was for a double batch BTW.) That said, it was an awesome pico! Everyone loved it, even my 2-year-old. With the adjustments to make it more authentic, it's definitely a keeper. Thanks for the inspiration, Paula!",
