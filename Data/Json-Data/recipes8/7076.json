The most tedious part is peeling and chopping the squash. The natural sweetness of the squash really shines through. I would have liked a bit more flavor, but overall it's a very good dish. I served it on its own (no rice) since I'm trying to avoid higher-carb meals. I garnished with a bit of minced cilantro. The only change I made was to use yellow onion instead of red since that's what I had on hand.",
