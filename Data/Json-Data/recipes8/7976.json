I only did a couple things differently, but they are just personal preferences and did not change the flavor of the dish. I removed the chicken thighs to have more room for the onion and garlic. I let those cook in the sauce until they had cooked down a little and then added the chicken back. I let the thighs simmer in the sauce for about an hour uncovered to get them nice and tender and to let the sauce thicken a little, but I'm sure they would be fine sooner if you didn't want to wait that long. I served them with rice and steamed broccoli. There was plenty of sauce to drizzle over the broccoli, which is always a plus. This was truly as good, or actually better, than Chinese take-out. This is a keeper!",

I skipped the cilantro because I don\u2019t like it and didn\u2019t substitute parsley because I didn\u2019t think it was necessary.  I think I might add about a half cup of water along with the honey and soy sauce, as the flavor was a little strong for me.  Still good, served it with rice and sugar snap peas.  This is just a tip regarding the honey:  I bought a 12 oz (net weight) bottle of honey, thinking it would be more than enough for the 8 ounces I needed.  It BARELY filled my 1 cup measuring cup.  I guess honey, because it\u2019s so thick, isn\u2019t measured in FLUID ounces.  Don\u2019t know that I ever ran across that info before.  I\u2019ll definitely look that up.
