The only changes were the addition of salt (curiously missing from the recipe) and garlic/hot sauce substitute because I didn't have Thai garlic chile paste. The mixture before the addition of the noodles was quite soupy but it thickened beautifully with them. Because the dish is so rich a side of broccoli or a nice tossed salad would go nicely too. I will definitely make this one again! Thanks rhapsody!",

I changed things a bit by adding 2 cups of chicken stock and 1 cup of water and also added lemon grass and cilantro to the broth. And I would only cook it for 3 hours and add the noodles at the last 5- 10 minutes as my noodles were a little over done for my liking. All and all an amazing hardy thai soup.",
