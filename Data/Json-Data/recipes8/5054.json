I made this on a whim and live out in the country where the grocery selection is limited so I had to make a couple of small changes. I used the lemongrass in the tube and also the ginger in a tube instead of \"fresh\". I must admit that it simplified the recipe because there was nothing to fish out before serving. This was really good and one I would make again.",
