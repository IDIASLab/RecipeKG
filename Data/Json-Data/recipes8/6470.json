The cream cheese filling is very rich and I was surprised how full I was after eating only two (which is probably the healthy size portion).  I didn't have jalape\u00f1os on hand so I substituted a half can of diced chiles instead.  I also added some chopped bell pepper, dehydrated onion mix and garlic to the cream cheese mixture.  I did not put any jelly on top because I can only handle a little bit of spice.  Honestly, I don't think it needed any other flavor on top.  Next time I make this, I will put it under the broiler for two minutes to top it off as I'd like the bacon a little more crispy and the cheese oozing out the sides a little burnt.",

The only thing I did was to use shishito peppers rather than jalapenos but that was a minor change since my peppers were quite spicy. I would put out a warning to be careful not to overcook the chicken. I'd start checking at 25 minutes because mine was a touch overdone. I must admit however to having turned on the broiler for the bacon for one minute at the very end. But still this is a company-worthy recipe for sure! YUM! Thanks!",
