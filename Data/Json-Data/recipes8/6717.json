I wish I had anchovies but I don't keep those on hand. Instead I used a couple dashes if worcestershire sauce. For the bread, I sliced up a french baggett and spread goat cheese on it and topped it with basil. The bread softens just enough when you dip it in the soup just tastes like a grown up grilled cheese and tomato soup. My hubby loved this and I will make it again. It was so easy to make everything.\nTip: if your soup is a little too acidic, add a bit of sugar to help balance it out.",
