Also, I fried the tortilla strips and dusted them with chili powder while frying them. But, as stated earlier, I got rave reviews for my improvisations. This one is definitely staying in the rotation :o)",

I did two bnls/sknls chicken breasts in the crock pot with chicken stock to get them shreddable then used the stock in the recipe (after straining out the fat). I was worried about the slices of jalepeno being too spicy but they weren't at all- as a matter of fact I'll probably add an extra next time for a little more kick. I think next time I'll skip the broiled onion rings because they didn't really add much for me and I wound up scorching half of them anyway! My husband said he loved it but that it was different from what he was used to(the broth was clear not red). I highly recommend this soup!",
