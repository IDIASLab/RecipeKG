        "description": "Fresh strawberries are one of the sweetest harbingers of spring and summer. And strawberry shortcakes are most assuredly one of the best ways to celebrate the arrival of warmer, sunnier days. Of course, the petite, layered berry-biscuit stacks aren't exactly fuss-free. This impressive skillet strawberry shortcake recipe eliminates much of the hassle and mess of traditional strawberry shortcakes. Instead of flouring the counter and rolling and cutting out individual biscuits, you'll bake one giant skillet biscuit cake that's topped with macerated strawberries and whipped cream.",

Prepping the dry and wet bowls was very easy.  I left my parchment paper a little oversized so it came up the sides. No risk of sticking.  I liked that I didn\u2019t have to pre heat pan.  I did everything as described but my dough was anything but loose and scrubby.  It was so thick I couldn\u2019t get all the flour mixed in. 1st change: I had to add about a quarter cup more milk which worked.  Put it in pan and topped with berries as written. 2nd change: I put the large crystallized sanding sugar on most of my sweet baked goods if the top will show.  Makes everything look special and gives a pleasant sweet crunch.  Just something my crew likes.",

Definitely suggest keeping the lemon zest for the macerated strawberries, it cuts the sweetness of the macerated strawberries a bit and added a bit of tartness that was great, doesn\u2019t make it taste like \u201clemon.\u201d",
