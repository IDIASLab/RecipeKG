This recipe makes 4 single-serve lasagnas, but you easily scale back and just make one, freezing the extra 3 pancakes for later use! The pancakes in this recipe are actually more like thick crepes that come out tasting like egg noodles. It's almost impossible to tell you didn't use pasta--since these pancakes taste like homemade lasagna noodles. Make it as-is or adapt it to your personal taste.",

I did make double the pancake batter and thus I had enough for 3 full layers and a top.  Wish I had had time to make double the ricotta (yummy!).  Next time I will make cheese the day before.  As it were, thinking ahead I managed to have things ready in proper order.  Also included a meat layer of ground beef and ground pork which I cooked ahead of time with added Italian seasonings.  I had sauce in my freezer but it needed more sauce... even if on the side.  (I had to keep it warm for late comers and it got a bit dry.)  I didn't have the Monterey Jack cheese but I will next time!  I did use mozzarella as well as the homemade ricotta and Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Loved the pancake noodles; made for a light lasagna.  They did not taste like crepes nor pancakes.  Family and Italian guest said was very good!  I do love John's recipes and funny anecdotes!  Will be creating this again and freezing individuals.",

Ricotta isn't available in my pueblo, so I sub with Goat cheese, add some sauteed Italian sausage or sauteed mushrooms. Garlic salt is a must-add as well, IMO. So as not the heat up the house, I actually bake these in my gas grill under indirect heat.  I'm really not exaggerating when I say this lasagna changed my life! Thank you Chef John!",
