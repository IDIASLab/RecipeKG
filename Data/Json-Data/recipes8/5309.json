I used all the ingredients except instead of using the dark chocolate chips I substituted a bar and a half of 85% dark chocolate bars. I used the end of a screwdriver to break up the bar into very small pieces. I was afraid my cookies would stick to the baking sheet so I sprayed some olive oil on it. I am so happy to have come across this recipe - delicious!",

I did refrigerate them for about an hour before baking them so they would be a little more firm to roll into balls. I do need to say that I halved the recipe (12 servings) and found that the amount of chocolate chips indicated for this amount (1/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp) was way too much...I couldn't get them all to mix into the dough. Next time I will not add the extra 2 Tbsp if I make that batch size again. 10 minutes was a good time they were firm on the outside and very soft on the inside. Next time I might cook them for only 8 minutes to have an even softer outer.:)",
