Between the avocado applesauce eggs and butter the texture is almost like bread pudding. The aroma of vinegar and cocoa overpower the taste yet somehow it is tasteless and bland. I think leaving out the vinegar and choosing either avocado or applesauce would render this a nice moist cake. I tried using red food colouring but it didn't come out red which has had no effect on my rating. It makes a very large cake. I made a half portion and it filled a 9 inch round cake pan baking for the 1 1/2 hours anyway. Thank you evenstaraleni for your recipe.",
