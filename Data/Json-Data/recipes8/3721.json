I added 1 small can of chopped green chilies to compensate for not being able to eat a full-flavored picante sauce, and I added 4 thinly sliced green onions for the same reason. We chose to use the brown rice, cooked in the microwave, and placed into the freezer for about 15 - 20 minutes to cool down rather quickly. The entire dish was room temp, and was very good.\r\nI think I'll have planned leftover chicken at least once every week to 10 days just for this dish. It's fantastic!. Thanks to the recipe writer, and please keep up the good work. I'm a for-sure fan!",
