The ingredients were tasty and a good base to build on. He suggested we could also add veggies, which I will try next time. On the second omelette I crumbled up some fresh bacon into it as well which was a tasty addition. Watching the video really helped me master the technique before attempting it. It\u2019s worth watching it a few times. Thank you Chef John for all your wonderful recipes! I\u2019m a huge fan. And so is everyone I cook for by proxy. lol",
