Rubbed on flank steak 20 mins before grilling last night and it was sooo good. Prepped ribs by peeling membrane rubbed with 1/4c apple cider vinegar and 1ts liquid smoke... This really tenderizes the ribs. Then rubbed GENEROUSLY with Wally's Rib Rub double wrapped in foil in frige overnight. Cooked according to AR's Scott Hibb's Amazing Whisky Grilled Baby Back Ribs from this point on. BEST RIBS I'VE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! I'm gonna repeat the process exactly tonight with a pork loin for tomorrow's Sunday family dinner... I have no doubt it too will be extraordinary =) UPDATE: Pork loin came out GREAT! Did everything exactly the same (Wally's Rub then Scott Hibb's sauce and method). Gonna do it again tonight with chicken breast. That makes 4 nights in a row we've used this rub! Steak Ribs Pork Loin and now Chicken... Maybe Salmon tomorrow...? =) P.S. ONE batch has sustained us all of these meals.",

When I made the 1st batch exactly by the recipe it was WAYYYYYYYYY to salty so I made another batch without salt at all combined the two batches and it was DELICIOUS (not to mention I now have enough rub to last for a long time!). So I highly recommend cutting the salt by half. You can always add more if it is not enough for your liking. After tasting these most people I cook them for don't even bother with the BBQ sauce!",

Rubbed the ribs with the spice mixture put them on top of sliced onions on a large baking sheet poured about a half can of beer on them covered tightly with foil and baked for 1-1/2 hours in a 350 degrees F oven. Then finished them off on the grill basted with BBQ sauce until they were crisped up about 15 minutes and served with extra BBQ sauce. Baking the ribs first cooked off the fat and the ribs were succulent and flavorful. I cut back on the salt and cayenne and will be using this rub in the future.",
