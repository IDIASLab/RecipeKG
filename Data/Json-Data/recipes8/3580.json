I'm not sure what other reviews are talking about when they said it was not moist or off putting. Not sure if an ingredient was left out or not.

I've made it twice now (both times using lemon cake mix), once as a bundt (cook 40 minutes) and a second time as jumbo cupcakes (makes 12/cook 22 minutes).  Both were very moist.  I wasn't a fan of the icing using just powdered sugar and lemon juice, so I added butter as one reviewer suggested, which was thicker and so much tastier.  I used 6 T. butter (room temp.), 6 T. fresh lemon juice, 6 C. powdered sugar.  I also added 1-1/2 t. lemon zest (optional).  If you love things lemony, you'll love this recipe.",
