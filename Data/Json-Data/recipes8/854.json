Between that, and the recurring requests in the Exchange for cookies that don't go flat, and people either unwilling or unable to use boxed cake mix, I was inspired to come up with this recipe. The basic recipe is for chocolate chip cookies. It is easily adaptable and can be customized to your liking.",
