If you're looking for a relatively palatable, somewhat healthy portable breakfast with a touch of sweetness, then you might enjoy these. I found some great ideas in the reviews but to be fair, wanted to rate the original recipe. I hate when folks change every ingredient then give a recipe 5 stars...you're rating your own recipe, or 1 star because it didn't turn out...not the recipe's fault when you change everything! SO I made 2 batches of these babies, 1 as written and 1 to play with. Either way, they were just ok. As written, we thought they were a little dry and the banana was not my favorite...might like pumpkin better? Not sure. For the other batch, I did as others suggested and added 1/2c cocoa powder. Also used 1/2c unsweetened applesauce instead of the banana, 1/2c nonfat buttermilk instead of the 1/4c rice milk, 2 eggs instead of 1, and 2 tablespoons of white sugar in addition to the brown. I baked both batches in 8x8 glass Pyrex dishes. The result was 2 pans of thick and chewy 'brownies'. The chocolate batch was less dry but still just ok. I probably won't make these again but they were fun to try.",
