I saw 1 Tablespoon and immediately knew I had to scale it back. I think I used 1 1/4 tsp MAX. I prefer my tastes to come from other herbs/spices anyways. I also didn't cook this on a conventional grill. I cooked the ribs using a Holland Grill which uses an indirect method of cooking- resulting in ribs that were OH SO MOIST and not dried out (think \"rib jerky\"). I must've overlooked where it said to let the ribs rest an hour before cooking...we were hungry! So I slathered the ribs up with the seasoning and onto the grill they went. Within less than 2 hours they were cooked to perfection! My dad was thankful and I received many compliments about how fresh moist and tasty the ribs were. I also heard the comment \"you wouldn't find ribs THIS GOOD in any restaurant!\" Smithfield/Farmland you guys were the star of the show!!!",

I placed the ribs in my electric pressure cooker and added enough water to cover and added the spice rub along with a teaspoon of liquid smoke to the water and ribs. Set the pressure cooker for 20 minutes and when it was done I put the ribs on the grill. I glazed some of the rib portions with sauce and left some plain. All of them came off the grill flavorful tender and juicy. You just grill them long enough to get some grill marks. This method of cooking took maybe an hour. Can't wait to try this on pork tenderloin.",
