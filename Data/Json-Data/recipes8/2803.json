Canola oil (vs. veg oil) makes them much crispier.  2.  use a cast iron skillet if you can, about 1\" of oil  3. Your oil must be very hot or they will be greasy, and you must cook them long enough or they will have chewy spots.  I would recommend only turning them once, otherwise the oil will repeatedly saturate.  Just put them in the oil and don't mess with them until they're nice and brown, then flip and wait patiently again.  4.  Use kosher salt!!!!  A sprinkle after every batch, while they're still hot.   Then, if you have leftovers, pop them in a 400* oven for 5-8 min and they will crisp right back up again!  (which also works great for bagged chips too)  GREAT technique, more time consuming that opening a bag but well worth the comments!  :)",

I used to work in a Mexican restaurant and we used to make them exactly this way. I don't know if the corn tortillas are formulated differently for the chips or if they used vegetable shortening instead of canola oil but these didn't turn out as tasty as I remember. They weren't bad but for the amount of oil and the overall taste or heaviness I would be just as happy with tortilla chips out of the bag.",
