It was our first time trying to make palak paneer and it is hard to imagine how this recipe can create GREEN palak paneer! With all the tomato paste and ginger called for we ended up with a very red gingery dish that tasted good... but not really like palak paneer. Suggest really cutting the tomato cutting the ginger and upping the spinach! Still tasty though!",
