I noticed that the cook time was a little short for a cheesecake,  but I followed the recipe, though did leave it cooling in the oven a little longer,   and even after being in the fridge all night, the cake started falling apart soon after it was taken out and sliced.   I would have definitely cooked it and kept it in the oven for at least another half hour.   Flavor wise,  it was okay, decent if you like pumpkin,  but I'd take a normal pumpkin pie over this cheesecake any day.",
