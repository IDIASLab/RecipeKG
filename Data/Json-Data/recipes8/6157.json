It was just myself my brother and my dad but we all thought this was the best ham ever! It was cheaper than a fancy store bought ham and tasted better. In addition to looking gorgeous it was sooooo sweet and tender it was falling apart. The glaze is also really simple to prepare. The only problem I had is I kept making holes in the oven bag when I was cutting the diamonds into the unbaked ham so I'd recommend doing that BEFORE putting it in the bag (I thought I'd save some dishes) and be careful with the toothpicks not puncturing the bag when you put on the pineapple! Also buy the biggest oven bag you can find. Our ham took about 45 minutes longer to bake than the recipe said and it was also 10 pounds. I think it's important to use an oven bag because it keeps the ham nice and moist. The glaze didn't reduce like I thought it would but I put it in a bowl in the refrigerator then took off all the solidified ham fat (eww!) on the surface and it was a great sauce! This is definitely a repeat thanks for the recipe! I've wanted to have a ham like this since I was a little girl...",

                "reviewBody": "Wow, I made this recipe today and have NEVER heard anyone rave about how juicy a ham was until today.  I used an 8-lb. butt portion, and scaled the recipe to 18 servings.  I placed the dressed up ham in the bag with the juices the night before and just took it out the next day an hour before oven time.  I baked it at 325 degrees until it reached 160, about two and a half hours.  I let it sit for about 15-20 minutes in the bag while I finished the sides.  I basted it twice during baking, but didn't need to.  Tip:  prepare the ham, i.e., score, pineapples, cherries, etc.  Then place the empty bag in a pan, and then put the ham in the bag, and pour juices over.  Once the ham is in the bag, you can't move it without the toothpicks piercing it!  This ham needs no sauces to cover it ... it stands on it's own, and that opinion was unanimous.  Try this, it's terrific and easy cleanup is a bonus.  Thanks!",

Therefore I scored my ham mixed the marinade and poured it over my ham uncovered in a roasting pan. I had a 15 pound semi-boneless ham and therefore cooked it for 2 hrs and 45 minutes. I probably basted it 3 to 4 times while it cooked. It turned out fantastic. I did wait to place my pineapple slices and cherry halves on during the last hour of cooking as I was afraid they may burn if placed on the ham sooner (since I was cooking mine uncovered). To me this recipe defines the traditional holiday ham.",

I didn't use an oven bag so that I could baste the ham but it still did not have as much flavor as I would have liked.

I did a 9 pound shank and cooked it at 300 degrees for a little over three hours basting every half hour or so. (I didn't use the oven bags because they're a pain in the butt in my opinion). Even without using the bag this ham still came out very tender and not at all dried out. I took the advice of some other members and tried bringing the leftover juices to a boil with some cornstarch but my \"gravy\" didn't thicken up... not sure what I did wrong. It still tasted great when poured over the ham. Overall very pretty and even more tasty! Thanks Rita!",

                "reviewBody": "I'd give it two stars but the ingredients were expensive and the sauce has a peculiar aftertaste and not a very pleasant aroma. I started with an excellent spiral ham that would have done well on its own. However this recipe had rave reviews so I thought I'd try it. The genuine maple syrup and honey were expensive but I had high hopes. It would have been better to baste the ham rather than to bag it as the top ended up dry and the bottom is soaked in an expensive and odd tasting concoction that includes orange juice maraschino cherry juice and ginger ale. You have to be careful with the bag and the juice level or you'll end up with a carbonized sugary mess in your oven. I also made the mistake of using Diamond party toothpicks (food-safe no-run color) which did bleed into the pineapple rings (gross - thanks Diamond!) I'm going to have several friends and family over to try it and hopefully we will like it once it's cooled down a little more. Just a horrible expensive mess in my view that ruined a perfectly good ham and a cup of genuine maple syrup and organic honey.",
