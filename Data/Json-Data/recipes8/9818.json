        "description": "This manduguk has a light beef flavor. It's just rich enough to make your lips a little sticky and you'll pick up on a subtle sweetness from the onions at the end. The fish sauce and sea salt impart umami in the soup, but it shouldn't overwhelm the beef broth or the other ingredients. All the add-ins, particularly the shredded beef, sesame oil, and nori, add savoriness without dominating each other for flavor. Serve with kimchi or steamed rice.",
