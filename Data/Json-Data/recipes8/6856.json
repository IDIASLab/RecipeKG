I used red bell pepper to add more color and to make sure the patties held together, I stuck them in the freezer for 30 minutes to firm them up. That step may not have been necessary but I didn't want to take any chances. I do think the serving size is off because you'll never be able to get 12 patties out of this. Plan on 6 at best.",
