I just have to sing the praises of this salad, as my DH and I loved it. Plus, it was dead easy to prepare. Usually I try recipes exactly as written the first time,  but I had to make one teeny change due to the calendar -- I don't eat \"fresh\" tomatoes in November, no matter the supposed garden-like growing conditions they may have sprung from. My substitute was well-drained diced fire roasted canned tomatoes, and I think they were perfect. I  won't bother to use fresh except during Aug/Sep. I think any diced tomatoes, flavoured or not, would be fine. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly  They were thoroughly cooked in the 30 minutes called for. I don't think you would want anything with the skin on, although bone-in skinless would probably be just fine.\n\nThis may not resemble other recipes labelled \"shawarma,\" but it's delicious and a definite repeat at our house.",
