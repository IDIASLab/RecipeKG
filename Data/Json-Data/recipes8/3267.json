I think the sauce is what really makes them (and to be honest, I was dipping tortilla chips directly in the sauce as an \"appetizer\" as I roll up the enchiladas.  Oops.) I used flour tortillas because that's what I had on hand and while I didn't have salsa to garnish these, I used fresh tomatoes, cilantro, and avocado.  I did cook mine for probably closer to 35 - 40 minutes thought.  20 minutes covered and then 15 - 20 more uncovered to get them nice and bubbly.  The best part of these is that the flavor only gets better the longer it sits.  I know this because I ate half an enchilada around midnight before heading off to bed and it was delightful.  Thanks for an easy recipe that's also vegetarian!",

I\u2019m not a huge straight cumin fan and had an open taco seasoning packet, so I used that in place of the cumin. I wanted to add protein, so I added a can of black beans to the filling. I also had half a jar of salsa verde so I used that on top pre baking. These are incredibly rich; the cheese filling goes a long way!  The only thing I\u2019d do differently is chop my baby spinach because I didn\u2019t like the *stringy* effect I got some bites.  Thanks for the recipe!",
