        "description": "It tastes like what you'd expect; meaty, cheesy, crunchy. The world is your oyster with this one! The pasta chips are super crunchy and a great base for these nachos. The ground beef has a good base of flavor from the Italian seasoning, garlic, and marinara which give it a quick and easy Italian-American flavor profile. The ricotta and the cheese sauce work well together in that one spreads over everything like a traditional queso, then you get pops of hot creamy ricotta. Optional toppings: half-moon zucchini slices, sauteed mushrooms, sliced pepperoncini, chopped Calabrian chiles, etc.",
