I enjoyed the sauce quite a bit and am going to make these without the bun and with a bit of wine in the sauce(heated at a low simmer)and some asparagus on the side for a 'dinner for two' with the hubby. It made a nice filling sandwich that I will make again as well for friends and for lunches.",

You can sub light sour cream which gives you a far healthier alternative to mayo and mustard on sandwiches and it also makes a great dipping sauce. You'll have tons left over so you could halve it if you don't want to use it for other purposes. Many reviewers menntioned the chicken was a bit bland so I chose to bread my chicken breasts in Italian style panko bread crumbs and the result was fantastic. You can see my changes in my modified version of this recipe on my profile. I was inspired and now I think this will be a regular on the dinner recipe rotation.",
