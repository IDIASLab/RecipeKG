I forgot to buy shredded cheddar, so I just used more slices (I broke apart 2 slices of cheddar and scattered them around on top). I didn't use bacon or milk. I just whisked 7 eggs with S&P and poured that on top. Next time I won't add the cheese on top till the last 5 minutes as it all ended up sticking to the top of the foil, so I didn't bother with letting it get bubbly & golden.",
