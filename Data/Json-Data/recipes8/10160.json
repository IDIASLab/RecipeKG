Why it\u2019s getting a 4 (4.5 if I could) once I had it all cooked - I realized this would be dry if I had no sauce! While the recipe doesn\u2019t need to provide one (this is for the chicken marinade) - to have a cook note calling out that you could serve with Tztaziki or ranch or something! I never even thought about it until I was all done cooking and about to assemble my pitas! I\u2019m a seasoned cook! \n\nSo, upon realizing this - we served with Ranch dressing. I wasn\u2019t about to whip one up and let the chicken get cold. Still very good. A homemade Tztaziki would be better.  Served on pitas with cubed cucumber, tomatoes, thinly sliced red onion and sliced black olives. Wish I had feta but finely shredded Parmesan worked in a pinch. For this recipe - just like making gyros - use a good, thin, pliable pita (I used Joseph\u2019s which is flax, oat bran and whole wheat. Amazing!). \n\nOverall - will absolutely make again and just be more prepared next time!",
