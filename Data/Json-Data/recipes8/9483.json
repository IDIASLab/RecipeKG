(Toddlers got deconstructed).\n\nTo my surprise, everyone loved it and asked for seconds - it was all gone in a flash. \n\nSurprisingly satisfying and delicious - definitely a go to dish. \n\nNote: I substituted fresh cucumbers on top because I had no zucchini - I would probably keep this sub. I made my own tahini sauce  (blended toasted sesame seeds + sesame oil). Both worked great.  The shrimp was made in a skillet which was good but grill might be better. \n\nThis makes for a beautiful, colorful, filling  and delicious lunch or dinner.",
