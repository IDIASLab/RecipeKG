Next recommendation would  be to start checking for doneness at about 13-14 minutes.  I checked mine at 18 minutes, and they were overcooked and really dried out.  They\u2019re between a 1/4 inch and 1/2 inch tall, so they baked quickly.  I had high hopes for this recipe, but it was a disappointment.   Sorry for the bad first review, and I don\u2019t want to discourage others from trying.   But this just didn\u2019t work for me, and I won\u2019t be making again.",
