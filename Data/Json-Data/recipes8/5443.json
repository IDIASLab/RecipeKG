Thank you for sharing your recipe! I had 15oz pumpkin pur\u00e9e to use & subbed it for the sweets. Rather than soak in water, I combined the dried cranberries with the pumpkin & coconut oil; refrig\u2019d overnight. Instead of oat flour, oats & I may increase to 3/4c next time. The batter was pretty thick. I added a half cup milk. It lightened them considerably, maybe too much. The density was more like cupcakes. Not a complaint; observation. Betz had some jumbo jumbo muffins!  This yielded 18 regulars in my house.  C: ... Notes: E said these - thanksgiving ones were \u201cFantastic\u201d These ... https://www.allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/62167408/fall-festival-pumpkin-cranberry-muffins/ ... were too sweet & spiced, but good;  Not better than Thanksgiving ones.
