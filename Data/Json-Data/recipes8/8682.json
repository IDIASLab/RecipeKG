What I ended up with was overcooked chicken and undercooked carrots (and I do love roasted carrots!).   What I would do in the future is cook the carrots at 400\u00baF for about ten minutes, then add the chicken thighs and the potatoes (which cooked fine at 350 in the recipe's timeframe).  The one thing that I forgot to add was the Roma tomato, but I think next time, I\u2019d just use sun dried tomatoes anyway for additional flavor.  I stuffed the chicken breasts early in the day, wrapped in plastic wrap, and put in the fridge until dinner.  Enjoyed, but I will approach this differently in the future.

And I used Greek olives. The stuffing was great - between the garlic, olives and tomatoes- my boyfriend called it an explosion of flavor. It was great.

I also cooked the vegetables separately from the meat as my daughter is a vegetarian so I m not sure if that was part of the problem. Additionally we substituted the chicken thighs with chicken breasts for larger portions so without the dark meat that probably dried it out a little too. Next time we will cover the meat with foil & put the temperature back at 350 degrees & not 375 degrees as others had suggested.",
