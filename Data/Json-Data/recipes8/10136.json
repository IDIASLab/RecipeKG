I Google\u2019d for a substitute which said fresh mozzarella, so that\u2019s what I used.   I was a little concerned about roasting the small potatoes for a total of 40-45 minutes @ 450\u00baF, that\u2019s really hot.  I lined my baking sheet with non-stick foil, checked the potatoes at 15 minutes, and they were already very brown and sticking a bit to the foil, so I flipped them.  Checked again at 10 minutes, and they were not only totally cooked but starting to dry out.  At t this point, I removed them from the oven at a total of 25 minutes cooking time, so I\u2019d suggest you keep an eye on them. A little overdone, however, they actually tasted very good.  I\u2019ll try these again at 400\u00baF which is typically what I use for roasting veggies.  Just need to get the timing right for my oven to get this a 5-star rating.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
