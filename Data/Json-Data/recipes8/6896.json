They are super picky and it's rare to find a meal that they all like. Well this is one! I cook this in a large lasagna pan. And after the first meal, we always have enough left over for two more meals. I chill the pan overnight in the fridge, then divvy the leftovers into food saver bags and vacuum seal them for the freezer.\nI do make a couple of changes to this recipe, I add about 1/2 cup of Asiago and mix it with the pecorino and I add about 1/2 cup red wine to deglaze the sausage and onions. Everything is better with asiago and red wine ;-)",

Also chopped up a 1/4 cup of fresh basil to replace the Italian parsley. Taste is amazing, texture is heavenly. Use whole-wheat pasta for a bit of extra nutrition.
