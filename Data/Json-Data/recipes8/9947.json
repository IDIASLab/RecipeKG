                "reviewBody": "There were a few missing elements to this recipe, such as when to add the spices (bay leaf and whole cloves) and where the \"uncooked onions\" come from (no mention of splitting this up).\n\nI based my execution on this recipe and the outcome was delicious. Kudos on the curry powder, nice touch. Beef was very tender, so I think the 1/2\" cubes were the right size for the timing.\n\nI am noting the recipe changes here:\n- Use beef broth/stock instead of water + bouillon. Adjust salt (I started with ~1/2 tsp while using beef stock which was salted).\n- Add the bay leaf and cloves to the beef simmer\n- I lightly browned ~2/3rds of the onion. The rest were thrown right into the pot. I also added carrots, which were sauteed first as well.\n- I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, only a scant teaspoon for my tastes\n- I used rock sugar! This is a sugar crystal that has sugar and molasses in it.\n- Obviously no beef bouillon cube since I had used beef stock directly.\n\nNote:\n- When browning the beef, I noticed juice coming out of my stew meat, preventing me from achieving a good brown. I poured out the liquid as it appeared so I could get the meat on a hot pan and get some maillard reaction going on (browning).",
