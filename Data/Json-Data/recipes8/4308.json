I baked for about an hour and fifteen minutes and that was plenty of time. I enjoyed these (and really like the bit of lingering heat) but do feel as thought the ranch and cajun compete a bit. I think I'd like them w/out the ranch packet (with some onion/garlic power) a bit more. I too only used a touch more than a half cup of Mazola (R) corn oil. THANKS for the recipe!",
