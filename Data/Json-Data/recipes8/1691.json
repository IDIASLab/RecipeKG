But whoa, when you bite into one of those blueberries and it pops in your mouth, you know this was a combo made in heaven.  That oil sitting in the skillet inside a 400\u00baF oven made the house smell like I\u2019d been deep frying, even with the exhaust fan running full power, didn\u2019t like that.  I\u2019d like to say I\u2019ll skip that step the  next time, but that smokin\u2019 hot skillet just sizzles when you pour in the batter, gives you perfect cornbread crust, with absolutely no sticking.  I really think it\u2019s an important step to this recipe\u2019s success, so would  recommend that you don\u2019t skip it.  Have tried cranberries before, but never blueberries in cornbread (this was better), and we really enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it\u2019s definitely a keeper.",

I substituted 1/2-cup of the cornmeal with Polenta which added to the crustiness of the bottom and made it less dessert-like or \"cakey\". I used fresh corn from the cob along with frozen jumbo blueberries. Rather than putting the pan in the oven as it was preheating, I put the skillet in the oven for 10-min once it reached 400 so there was no smoke.  This recipe was printed and put into my favorite recipe book -  thank you for sharing!",
