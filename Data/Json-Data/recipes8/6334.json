First I pulsed the cereal in the food processor (so the balls would keep their shape) and used 2 c instead of one because I didn't want to refrigerate therm as long and I liked the texture. Then I did such an ugly job with the dipping I wound up dipping the whole thing then tossing them in more pulverized cereal to make them look nice while cutting the richness of the chocolate just a bit. I'll try coconut next time. Anyway they look different but its the same recipe! I'll test them out at Christmas and revise my review with the results!",
