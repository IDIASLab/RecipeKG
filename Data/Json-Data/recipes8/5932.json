Taste-wise I felt it was too one note and likewise texture wise it the same problem. I even added additional seasonings but it still fell flat flavorwise. I think the Velveeta kind of masks and smothers spice. If I was going to make this again I'd probably use colby jack or other cheese with more of a kick to it. And to make it more pleasing to the mouth I'd dice in some bell pepper near the end only lightly cooked to give it the much needed crunch factor to break up the monotonous texture.",

My ground beef had taco seasoning on it which was a great touch! I also had to use spiral noodles instead of macaroni because that's all I had. I think I may have added a little too much but I just added a little bit more water and it was fine. I added about half the amount of Velveeta because I don't really care for it that much. It was still plenty cheesy/creamy. I will definitely make this again!",
