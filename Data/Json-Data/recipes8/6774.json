Instead of simmering uncovered and adding water to keep the onions and beef covered, I simply simmered it covered for the same amount of time and no additional liquid was needed. I added about 3-4 tablespoons of minced garlic along with the wine. Picked up a couple of empty bread bowls from Panera to serve in. Delicious!",

The last time I had French Onion Soup at a restaurant it was quite disappointing, so I've been looking to fix that by making my own.\n\nI really enjoyed this recipe, however, I feel the use of ribeye was a little overkill.  Next time I will probably go with a bone-in chuck roast and hopefully achieve the same flavor for less investment.\n\nThe only thing I changed on this recipe was adding additional beef broth as the soup reduced rather than the recommended water.  I was concerned about diluting the flavor.  In total, I used about 80 oz of broth (2 1/2 cartons).  The soup seemed to reduce quite a bit over the course of three hours, and I lost a little bit of broth due to skimming fat.",
