                "reviewBody": "This is sure a delicious and fun bread to make! Not to mention it's beautiful too! I had to change a few things to make this work for me however. First off just placing the yeast in warm water is not enough to proof it. You gotta feed it--so I simply warmed up the milk and water together added 2 tbsps of brown sugar to that and then added the yeast. That worked well proved the yeast and also gave the bread itself a touch of sweetness that was very much enjoyed. Secondly it's important to really finely chop the chocolate. Even by doing so I felt that there was not enough to get an even layer all the way across the bread. So I'd increase the amount of chopped chocolate in the filling next time. I also used a mix of 56% 60% and 86% cocoa chocolate bars and would do so again. Thirdly I reduced the salt to a 1/2 tsp and am glad I did. 1 tsp would have made it too salty for our tastes. Lastly reserving 3 tbsps of the cinnamon-sugar for the topping is far too much. I'd only save 1 tbsp max and keep the rest in the filling. Oh and a final note: this bread is called Cinnamon-Chocolate Chip Bread but there's actually no chocolate chips in it--it's just some chopped chocolate. This is no way effects the outcome of the bread but rather just an observation about the name. Overall: great bread would make again! And it baked perfectly in 42 minutes. Thank you for the recipe!",
