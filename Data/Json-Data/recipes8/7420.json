        "description": "Certain flavors have always meant to be together, like jalapenos and cream cheese. Or bacon and...well, almost anything. Pistachios, however, get forgotten too often! They are a contradiction in your mouth: creamy, smooth nutty flavor with a crunchy texture. At some point it occurred to me to try adding pistachios to stuffed jalapenos, and these delicious beauties were the result. I made two different versions since I'm lactose intolerant and my husband hates goat cheese. Both are delish!",

Pistachio's are $10 a pound here and then you have the hassle of getting the shell off before chopping. I could taste them yes but were they worth it in the end? To me, no. I would have been just as content by adding more cheddar and calling it good. Hubby on the other hand enjoyed the pistachio addition very much. Maybe I just don't care for my nuts to be be warm and softened? Give them a try and you decide for yourself.",
