Also, I couldn't wait an hour after cooking, so just after it cooled a bit, I poked with a skewer (while still in the bundt pan) and basted with the glaze...then I turned it over onto a plate and gave it about 15 minutes to cool before drizzling the rest of the glaze.  This cake is so light and dreamy, the glaze adds just enough goo to the bottom, like pineapple upside-down cake goo, but lighter and crispier.  I'm generally not a big lemon person, but I will totally make this again, it's so good.",
