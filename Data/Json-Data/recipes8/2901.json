Ok back to the taco...this was a last minute decision for lunch today to use up some avocados so I had to go with what I had on hand. I didn't have any corn tortillas and personally they are not my fave so I used a WW flour tortilla. Also I had no cabbage so I just used lettuce and chopped up a regular tomato. I can't believe how wonderfully crispy and delcious the avocado came out (no one would know that these were baked ad not fried). I served it w/ a side of sour cream and taco sauce which I think is a must! I will def be making these over and over YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
