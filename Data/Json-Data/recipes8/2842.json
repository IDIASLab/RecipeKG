In Mexico we buy the right variety of peppers, cook them down, throw them in the blender, etc to make meals like this.  This saves all that hassle for a genuine taste.  My entire family says it's as good as the tortilla soups served here in local restaurants.  That's the highest compliment a recipe can be given!  Don't bother cooking the chicken ahead of time.  Throw it in with the rest in the beginning and shred it 2-3 hours later.   Hint:  serve with lime juice, a tsp of sour cream, chopped avocados, or pork rind along with the cheese to really eat it like a Mexican.  BTW, I bought bagged tortilla chips and worked fine.",

Take 3-4 large dried ancho chiles (cut off the stems and remove the seeds) and boil them with a cup or so of water, garlic and onion. After a half hour, whir it all together in your blender with a small can of tomato puree. Add some cumin if you like. Salt to taste. I live in Mexico, and believe me, there is NO such thing as canned enchilada sauce here. Also - the shredded or sliced chicken is usually added as a garnish here, not cooked in the soup.",

I also omitted the salt and used low salt products.  Used a 2nd can of chicken broth in place of the water.  Store bought tortilla chips are the way to go - try melting some sharp cheddar on the chips before adding to the soup along with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro and a dollup of sour cream - yum!",

And except for using broth instead of water which really should have helped this and black beans rather than corn I prepared this as the recipe directed. I had to try and save it! To start with I removed the majority of the liquid from the slow cooker and replaced it with chicken broth--better but there still was no substance to the soup. So I cooked a cup of rice and added it to the soup at the end and...now we're talking! MUCH better--now it's FIVE stars. I topped each serving with sour cream which really mellowed it out and added a rich creaminess shredded cheddar cheese and the tortilla crisps (which by the way didn't EVEN need 10-15 minutes so watch them carefully!) Now I had a soup that was not only palatable but it was just delicious. But the effort I had to put into it to make it so was too much trouble a waste of some ingredients and just simply not worth it. The soup I ended up with was downright delicious--but it was not THIS recipe.",
