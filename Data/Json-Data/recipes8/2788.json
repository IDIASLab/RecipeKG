I did use flour tortillas instead of corn because that is what I had on hand (and did not fold in half but fried flat like a quesadilla) and did add about 1 tablespoon of dry taco seasoning. The whole family loved it. I was looking for a great way to use up leftover pork roast as it always seems to get thrown out and this is now where all of our leftover port roast will go. Very delicious!! Will definitely be making again as everyone is already asking when we can have them next. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.",
