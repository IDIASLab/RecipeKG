They taste almost identical to Argentinian Empanadas. (I can see why they didn't call them that though). \n\nMy only suggestion would be to serve them with chimichurri (or really any other sauce, or guac) and not sour cream. Also to make them (slightly) more authentic, don't add the adobo to the meat but use it as a dipping sauce, since usually empanadas aren't spicy to begin with.",
