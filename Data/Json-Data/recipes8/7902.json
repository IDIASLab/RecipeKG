However, when I tried the hummus I couldn't taste the beet anymore and it had the most beautiful purply pink color. I could eat it with carrots and just enjoy it on a wrap or piece of toast. You seriously can't taste the beet and I can't stress this enough because I know this is what worries most people with these kinds of recipes. Beets are just packed with great nutritional benefits so I seriously recommend this recipe. Store in the refrigerator.",
