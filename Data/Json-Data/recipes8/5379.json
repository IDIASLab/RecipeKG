I didn't have a zucchini so I used beet greens and I didn't even have to adjust the cooking time at all.",

The only other reviewer (at this time) gave it a 5 star rating - but didn't use zucchinis - she used beet greens. I sauted diced zucchini (not grated) with onion and sweet red pepper. I used extra onion basil and even crumpled bacon with the squash and it was still bland. I liked the zucchini diced but next time will try it without sauteing it or I will try other ingredients next time because I like the frittata concept",

The grated zucchini and onion, with the almond flour, gave it a kind of grainy texture, and I think I prefer more of a chunky texture.  With all the onion, I felt pretty comfortable about leaving out the onion powder.  I took the frittata out of the oven right at 35 minutes, and it was completely done.  I like the fact that it is grain and dairy free.  I'm looking forward to seeing how it will taste, tomorrow.",
