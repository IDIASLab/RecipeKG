I only needed half the lemon glaze; and I found that the streusel could have been added sooner in baking time, as it did not all stick to the muffin tops. The batter was thick and easy to work with, and the  finished muffins came out easily from the liners. Besides having a few steps (the 4-star rating due to preparation time), these were great - and filling!",

The recipe as written also made a full dozen muffins, not 10.  Also used coconut sugar, which made the muffin much darker than the photo.",
