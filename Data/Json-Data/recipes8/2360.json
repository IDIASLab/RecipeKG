I used regular onion as I didn't have red, and sliced it thick so I can pull it out of my serving easily.  That said, the next day, the onion taste was too strong for me- I liked it better after tasting it slightly chilled the night before.  I will definitely make again and skip the onion.  May add cilantro to add to the flavor.  My son really enjoyed it.",
