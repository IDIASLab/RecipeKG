I\u2019ve made this w/adjustments mentioned (reduced sugar, dried oregano etc) but I also add 1/2 to 1 cup of dried apricots and use a mix of boneless thighs and breasts cut in half.  Also, the brown sugar and wine shouldn\u2019t be in the marinade but after being marinaded and chicken put in roasting pan, the wine is added and brown sugar then sprinkled directly on chicken.  And finally, once cooked, the chicken, fruits, olives etc. are removed and the pan juices reduced by about half and then poured over chicken/fruit.  It\u2019s a lovely, delish entree suitable for company yet fairly quick to put together for family.",

I'm giving it 4/5 because the chicken turned out a tad dry - I think you might get better results with chicken thighs? But the marinade is amazing. We served over rice, and I think potatoes would be good too, orzo pasta probably delicious as well.",
