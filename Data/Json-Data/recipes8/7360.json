I'm sure it would be great as written too lol but I was trying to get this done during my son's nap time and didn't feel like prepping veggies. This would be great for camping houseguests or the morning after slumber parties. Worked perfectly but also LOOKED nice which is not something I was expecting out of something cooked in a sandwich bag!
