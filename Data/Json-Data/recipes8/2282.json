I used the store bought juice to make it to the 1/2 cup the recipe called for. I also added a little more pepper because I love pepper! Will make this again and again!",

Being cilantro is a semi-acquired taste I've also done this sans avocado substituting lemons for lime/juice fresh basil for cilantro & sweet Cherubs (grape tomatoes halved) for avocado.
