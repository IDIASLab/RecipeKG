I do agree on the liquid ratio so I added enough milk to cover the potatoes. Perfect! Also instead of dicing the potatoes I thinly sliced them making this soup look like 'restaurant style'. I did not blend the potatoes with a stick blender as it was thick enough. Will definitely add to my cookbook!",

Didn't use water or base; only chicken broth and fat free half and half. Hubby smoked a pork tenderloin so I added that in lieu of the bacon. Sprinkled in more seasonings (garlic and onion powders dry mustard and dried parsley) and used three leftover baked potatoes from Sunday dinner. I ran the potatoes thru the food processor before I began so I didn't need to puree. Lastly I felt this needed more cheese than stated. In addition to the horseradish cheddar I used I also threw in some parm. Didn't feel the need to use my slow cooker for this; worked well on top of the stove. This was a great place to start Kathy; just made it my own. Thanks so much as this turned out absolutely delicious!",

Just by looking at the recipe before I made it four cups liquid would not be enough for five pounds of potatoes. I used organic red potatoes and instead of chicken soup base and plain water I used organic chicken broth (about six cups). I didn't need the flour (I've had some experiance cooking potato soup--flour is not really needed as the potato starch thickens the soup well enough) so I cut back on the butter just a bit and sauteed the onion carrots celery and a mess of minced fresh garlic all together before adding it to the crockpot with the potatoes and broth. I did add a few more spices (dried chives onion powder garlic powder Beau Monde seasoning). After the potatoes had cooked in the crockpot I mushed them with my potato masher only slightly for a chunkier soup then added the milk (I used fat free evaporated milk for a creamier texture--I didn't need the full cup). When this was all said and done this is a fair soup that was bendable to make my own and worked well to stretch what I had for a cheap lunch this week. I think this would be a good soup to substitute in cauliflower for low-carbers too.",
