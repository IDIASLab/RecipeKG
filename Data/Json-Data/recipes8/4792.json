You make it with mushrooms for Christmas Eve dinner - no meat for the Polaks that day. On all other occasions, we add kielbasa, bacon, or some pork meat instead. You can add some tomato paste to amp up the flavor. Bay leaf will also aid with the flavoring. You can make it just with the fresh cabbage or just with the sauerkraut - depending on what you like. Also - I've never heard of adding sugar to it - cut it - you won't miss it. One last thing - we make it in a pot on the stove. Originally, it's not a baked dish, rather, it's cooked.",

I place 2 pounds of country-style pork ribs on top of the mixture, cover the ribs with 8 oz. of beer, cover and cook it in a slow cooker for 8 to 10 hours.  When the meat is very tender, I remove it from the crock, cool slightly, and shred it.  I then add the shredded meat back into the cabbage mixture and continue to cook on low for about 20-30 min., until heated through.  I usually serve this with either egg noodles or kluski (potato dumplings with onions and salt port) and rye bread.",
