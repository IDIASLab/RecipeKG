Skipped the sweet onions. Made the burgers smaller and used regular hamburger buns (never seen the Hawaiian rolls around here). Topped my burger with processed cheese Emmenthal lettuce regular tomato pickles Dijon mayo & ketchup. I did my best to stay true to the recipe. These are a handful and a mouthful but so tasty! It does need to be seasoned a little more and maye use raw garlic instead as it was way to mellow to taste in my opinion after being roasted then cooked in the burger. Served this with \"Spiced-Up Grilled Tater Wedges\" from AR.",

I have to admit while I did use all the ingredients called for I didn't measure but used them more or less 'to taste' like more roasted garlic spices and so on... I realized too late that I didn't have any gas in my grill so I used the Goerge Foreman. Because of that I sauteed my onions in a pan and then put them on top of the burgers after they were cooked. This does seem like a long list of ingredients but these really do come together easily. I will definately be making these again hubby already informed me of that lol! Thanks for sharing.:)",
