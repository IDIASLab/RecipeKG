To make this ahead of time I like to cook the eggs in well-greased muffin tins for a half hour pop them out cool them a bit and then build my sandwich. I wrap the pre-made sandwich in a papertowel and put it into a sandwich bag and refrigerate. When my husband is getting ready to walk out the door all I have to do is take the sandwich out of the plastic bag and microwave it for a minute or so.

I made these individually vs. all eight at once. Grands biscuits store nicely in the fridge so I made these sandwiches as needed. I microwaved a scrambled egg in a pudding cup sprayed with Pam for about 35 seconds for each sandwich. All that's left to do was top with my favorite cheese and breakfast meat and this was perfect for my husband to take to work. This was so easy to make and and done in no time at all!",

I made 1/2 recipe but found the sandwiches needed at least 1 egg per sandwich. So the full recipe really needs like 8 eggs. To make it quickly I used pre-cooked bacon. I just popped about 8-10 pieces in the microwave for 50 seconds for half the recipe. When I baked the biscuits I put them on a foil sheet and sprayed the sheet with Pam and the biscuits lightly also. It made them a little crispy and not so soft. Thanks for showing me how absolutely easy these are really to make.",
