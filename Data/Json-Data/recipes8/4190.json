The only thing I'll do differently next time is cook for a shorter time.  I opted to bake for the 27 minutes.  The rolls were a little dry but still really good.  And the frosting is sooo yummy! \n The dough is very sticky to work with, so the rolling between plastic wrap is necessary.  It is a bit difficult to make the dough a nice rectangle because of the stickiness.  I also only made 9 rolls out of the dough since that is what fit better in my baking pan.  When letting the rolls rise, a warm area is necessary.  I tried letting them proof at room temp and nothing happened.  I turned the oven on for a couple of minutes and turned it off and put the rolls in.  They puffed up nicely.",

So happy to have a cinnamon roll again!  I really liked that the recipe used olive oil in it - cannot taste it at all.\nI did not use the cream cheese glaze, but  instead made one with 1 c. 10x, 1/2 tsp. vanilla, 2 T. butter or vegan butter, and 1 1/2 T. hot water.  So good -- I ate two right away after baking, and two later that evening.  :)  My husband, who is not GF, even said these were very  good and that I could make them again (instead of my old non-GF recipe).",
