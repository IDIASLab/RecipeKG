It's fairly easy to make but I would suggest cutting the salt back by half and not covering the dough for the final rise. The dough stuck to the wax paper and deflated the bread. You need a lot of extra flour to prevent the loaf from sticking to the pot, I sprinkled extra into the pot before adding the dough. I baked it for 10 minutes, uncovered, and I wouldn't bake if for any longer than that as it was very brown, on the edge of burning.",
