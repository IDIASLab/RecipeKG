Minced prosciutto instantly transforms commercial chicken broth into a ham-flavored soup base. Italian sausage reinforces the pork flavor and makes the soup substantial and satisfying. Mashing some of the canned beans thickens the soup and gives it the body of one that's been long simmered. Sauteed onions, carrots and celery add depth of flavor and ensure the soup's homemade feel.",

I made a few alterations, but it turned out to be just as good as the Tuscan White Bean and Pancetta soup at my local gourmet market.  I used only 1/2 lb. fresh sausage which I crumbled and browned in the first step, I chopped the veggies finely and I used a turkey stock I made after Thanksgiving using lots of fresh rosemary.  I highly recommend adding in a fresh sprig or two when you simmer the soup- the flavor is great with the beans.  Also, I pureed all 3 cans of beans in my processor until they were just chunky- this made the soup very rich and thick.  If you want to be really decadent I think you could also stir a 1/2 - 1 cup cream or half and half at the end.  Great soup, and very easy!",
