                "reviewBody": "Have made this many times often quadrupling the serving size to have extra to freeze. It gets even better with the addition of sausage (I use turkey sausage but any other type would be delicious as well) and I love garlic so I add much more than the amount listed here. I also am a huge bean fan so I like a denser soup that gives a heap of beans in every bite in addition to broth and I typically add one extra can of beans for every can of tomatoes/mushroom soup (usually red beans or something that will give a bit more color). The best way to enjoy this is to get the tomatoes beans and soup started simmering and dump in frozen/pre-peeled cooked shrimp and let it all slowly heat while you saute the celery onions and garlic. Then dump the saute into the pot and keep on low-medium heat so all the flavors sufficiently diffuse and the shrimp slowly cook...then put it away and let it refrigerate overnight. This condenses the flavors even more allowing the garlic and spice to really infuse the broth and it just gets even better and more flavorful the longer it sits. Have even considered adding a can of corn to complement the sweetness of the sausage. This is just such an intensely deep recipe if you allow all the flavors to meld together long enough -- don't eat it the same day you cook it as a general rule. Also helps if you cut back on the amount of water added to make a thicker and more intense broth.",

Made the following changes; 1/2 large sweet onion chopped for green onions 1 can RoTel Diced Tomatoes w/ Habaneros for diced tomatoes w/ green chilies beef broth for water condensed golden mushroom soup for cream of mushroom soup 1/2 lb. shrimp/1/2 lb. sea scallops/Aidell s Chicken & Apple sausage 3 links for 12 ounces shrimp. The scallops shrimp and sausage were first rubbed w/ Badia Blackened Redfish seasoning ( Blackened Seasoning Mix from this site or some other seafood rub you prefer also works) and then seafood and sausage were saut\u00e9ed separately from the broth given different cooking times for each. The seafood/sausage was added to the soup after it finished cooking and allowed to rest for 10 or so minutes. This soup is hot and spicy so it would not be suitable for some especially young children. This goes toward the top of our list of most favorite soups.",
