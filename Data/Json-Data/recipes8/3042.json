                "reviewBody": "Sorry, but poor instructions.  I've been making Eggs and chorizo for about 45 years now.  First off... you CAN'T say \"three sausage links\" as chorizo links come in different sizes.  There is NO STANDARD.  A chorizo sausage link from the supermarket is nearly a foot long.  A link from the butchers can be 3 to five inches long, AND one of the local markets deosn't even use links.  They leave the raw Meat free like hanburger chubs.  Second, you didn't specify, Beef, Pork, soy or Beef/pork mix.  Other than that, the directions were OK, but if you mess up the beginning, or, the FOUNDATION, if you will, you're gonna end up with BLECH.\n\nBy the way, SPANISH chorizo is already cooked.  These recipes/recomendations are for MEXICAN chorizo, which is RAW MEAT.\n\n  Also, How many people know what how to tell when corn tortillas are cooked through?  Somneone is liable to end up with tortilla chips!  lol  Corn tortillas should be warmed up till they are soft... pliable.\n\nI give FIVE STARS for the dish, but take away one for the instructions.  ;)",

I should have had my non-stick pan a little hotter than medium for cooking both the sausage and after adding the eggs. It turned into a muddled messy looking mixture but still tastes great. My other poor choice was to use standup taco shells because I wanted a hard shell instead of soft. I wish I had used a flat tostado hard shell instead or else stuck with the recipe and used soft corn tortillas. Nevertheless I topped with pepper jack cheese and some sour cream and enjoyed it. It wasn t pretty or easy to eat but it tasted good!",
