I used the submitter's flour mix and, even though I normally don't like millet flour, it really is good. Both texture and taste are impressive. I used the whisk attachment to aerate the dry ingredients before mixing in the wet ingredients with the paddle. I mixed everything as directed but after 4 minutes on high, I had a batter not a dough. So, keep your eye on that.  I used a wet rubber scraper to transfer it to the parchment paper. The baking pan size is also worth mentioning. I baked it on a 10\" x 15\" sheet and the dough didn't cook completely throughout because there was simply too much dough for the amount of space available. Next time, I will use a larger sheet in order to have a thinner crust. I also added a bit of oil on the parchment paper; both the bottom and top sheet. Thank you, Allen, for the recipe!!",

Only suggestions are:  maybe omit the xanthan if the blend you use already has it in there, and, I would love the weights used for the flours as blends are all different volume.
