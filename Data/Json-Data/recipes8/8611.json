I didn't have any sesame seeds so I added a splash of sesame oil and then after the chicken cooked I drizzled a few extra drops over the chicken.  Also, I used chicken pieces on the bone (a whole chicken cut into 8 pieces) and I think because it took almost twice as long to cook the glaze benefitted from the extra time and turned a deep color.  Beautiful.  My teenage son and my husband scarfed down the whole chicken (a single wing leftover) and used the extra glaze/pan drippings (which I defatted with my defatter cup) over the rice and broccoli and chicken on the plate.  I give this 5 stars, but next time I might add a crushed garlic clove or two.  Thanks!",

I also salted and peppered the chicken before I added the sauce.  The result was spectacular.  Everyone loved it and I will be making this again.  A recipe does not have to be complicated to be good.  The only thing I will do next time is flip over the chicken during cooking so it can soak in the flavor on both sides.  When done don't dump the juice, use it as a sauce for rice or some other side.  Yummy.",
