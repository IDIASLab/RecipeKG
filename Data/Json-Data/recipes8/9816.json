They are cake-like cookies piled with thick, rich chocolate icing. The cookies themselves are on the dry side, so the icing is there to help provide moisture and richness. Store in single layers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.",

I only have one rack so I switched trays every 5 minutes\nThey were BURNT on the bottom. I am in the process of making another batch- again I put them on lis rack where they had a light color, bit when I cracked one open it was raw. They look great, the bottoms are perfect\nI am praying that sitting on they tray for 30 minutes will somehow bake the middle - I can\u2019t afford to bake another batch!",
