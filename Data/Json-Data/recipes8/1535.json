That little bit of sugar at the end adds some real interest to this.  One bite may be spicy, then the next just a little sweet, a good balance of spicy-sweet. The Rice Krispies\u00ae are so small in relation to the size of the squares, they tend to sink to the bottom of the bowl, but I do like their crunch.  Very nice mix, will make this again.",
