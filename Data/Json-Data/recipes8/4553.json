                "reviewBody": "I'm giving this 4 stars after having made a few alterations. First I left out the tomatoes cilantro and red wine vinegar simply because I didn't have any on hand. I then used both green and red bell peppers (good for the flavor and the color) some chili powder (to taste) and added some frozen corn that I had left over. Having cooked these ingredients on the stove top as well as the garlic black beans and olive oil from the recipe I mixed it all together with the squash. To finish I topped it off with my favorite salsa (Southwest Salsa from Safeway). In the end it was pretty dang good. Definitely not bland as it has been called in other reviews but I think this was largely due to my alterations - the salsa is what really helped I think. My wife also added sour cream which she claims was another great addition (I'm not a fan of sour cream so no comment from me). Really the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 in the end is that the texture was a bit \"mushy\" which detracted slightly from the overall experience. We ate it as a meal in and of itself but it would go along great as a side to many Southwestern/Mexican/Spanish inspired dishes. I think I might try the leftovers in a tortilla with some cheese tomorrow.",
