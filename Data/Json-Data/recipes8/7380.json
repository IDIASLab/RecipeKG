A couple of pointers though, first there isn't any parsley listed in the ingredients but is called for in the recipe so that correction should be made. I had some on hand so that was no big deal. I didn't use sugar as I think tomatoes are sweet on their own and didn't see the need for that addition. I also cut the tomatoes into slices instead of just in half and cooked them for about 10 minutes and they turned out great. I also would use a little more bacon, but that's just again, a personal preference. I would make this again though. It made for a nice lunch.",

I think that I would have liked it more had I taken the half with the thinner slice of tomato. I followed the recipe exactly except for not pureeing the sauce (I just used a fork). That was a new way to poach eggs for me though I had heard of the method before. I'll try it again to see if it is any easier but I may go back to my old way of cooking the eggs. Be sure to season the guacamole with salt and pepper because it really does make a difference. I was happy to use Avocados from Mexico because that is what I usually buy from my store!
