My husband and I really enjoyed the fresh kick of the salsa and the blend of shrimp/veggies in the taco.  The only tough part of this recipe was the corn tortillas being more delicate than flour ones. We prefer the taste of the corn tortillas, but when it was time to fry them, we did lose a few tacos to the oil as they broke apart so easily.  (We ate the broken ones even with half the filling spilled out... it was just that tasty!) Overall a good recipe that I would like to try again.",

If you\u2019re looking for something quick to fix this is not it. The recipe called for 1/2 head of cabbage chopped, but when it comes to the prep work all that I had to use according to the instructions was a fourth of a head plus a cup so I don\u2019t know what we were supposed to do with the rest of it that was chopped. Also would\u2019ve been nice if you gave an exact amount called for in the sauce because not all heads of cabbage are the same size. Mine was a very small head. I was so expecting this to taste awful but surprisingly it tasted pretty good. I think if I make it again I will add more tomato to the sauce and less cilantro. Seems all the corn tortillas I buy, no matter what  brand, want to fall apart immediately before you even put them in the skillet any more. I had the same problem with these tonight so it was a bit of a challenge. I just bought them at the store today so I know that they were fairly fresh. Thanks for the recipe. Definitely different.",
