        "description": "Red beans and potatoes pre-cooked then stewed with fresh vegetables in a 7-quart Instant Pot&reg;. Before serving, brown miso, yeast extract, liquid smoke, and a splash of vinegar are added to round out the flavor. This soup uses an array of fresh ingredients, a variety of mushrooms, yeast extract, and miso to create an umami flavor and a stew-like consistency that renders a comforting vegan soup. It takes some time to prepare, but the outcome is definitely worth it, and you have soup for a week to boot. The soup will keep in the fridge for up to a week. Freeze leftovers. It's not pretty when thawed, but still delicious.",
