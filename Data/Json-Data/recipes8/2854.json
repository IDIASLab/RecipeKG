I subbed flour for corn tortillas and omitted the onion. I've found a new favorite camping food!:) Update I made these camping yesterday and they we SO good! My husband couldn't believe how good they turned out...I think he was a little leery of \"campfire tacos.\" I had precooked the beef at home so all I had to do was assemble and cook once we started our campfire. I'm sure they'll be requested whenever we camp from now on!:)",
