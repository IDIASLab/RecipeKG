It is a very simple and easy to make recipe. The dosa was very soft, had a melt-in-mouth texture and absolutely delicious. My family loved it. Hope you all would like it too. Serve the dosa hot with milagai podi (chutney powder) or any chutney. You can serve along a dollop of butter, but that is optional.",
