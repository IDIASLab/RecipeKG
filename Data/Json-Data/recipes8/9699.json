I have no complaints with the taste of these guys, but the consistency I got was very mushy. The ratio of oats-sweet potato I think is off. I\u2019d try 0.5 cups of sweet potato and 1 cup of oats, or, 0.75\nCups of oats\u2026..I\u2019ll have to make the adjustments and report back to see what ratio works for me!",
