I changed the frosting to 1/2 butter, 1/2 cream cheese (my personal preference).\nthe thing about the frosting is with all that juice from the raspberries and lemons, it was way too thin.  I added over a cup more of confectioners sugar, and it was still too thin. I ended up with REALLY sweet and thin icing.  next time I make these (and I definitely will!), I am going to use a teaspoon of lemon and raspberry extract instead.\nalso, the recipe kept calling for unsalted butter AND then salt...skip the salt, use salted butter (my opinion).\nFYI. used two lemons to make these....but as I said, for the frosting, I will use lemon extract, so only really need one large lemon to make all the zest and juice for the cupcake part.",
