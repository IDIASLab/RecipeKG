That seemed like too much for the amount of potatoes I had so I added in a couple ounces at a time and ended up using less than 4 ounces. That was plenty for me. I added in the remaining ingredients and opted to add in another 2 tablespoons of milk because the potatoes were a bit stiff. The potatoes whipped up nicely, had a lovely creamy texture, and they had a really nice taste to them. You have to gauge how much cream cheese, milk and butter to add to the potatoes because a medium size russet potato isn't an exact measurement, and more or less of those ingredients may be needed. I suggest adding in the cream cheese a few ounces at a time rather than adding it all at once. I think if I had used the whole 8 ounce block, it would have been overwhelming. I added chives to my individual serving of the potatoes.",
