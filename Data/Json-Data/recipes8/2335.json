I used a personal sized melon for the two of us but I would use a regular sized watermelon in the future because the pickled rind was too thin and tough.I would also watch the red pepper amount because it did seem a bit hot for our tatse. The recipe looks way more complicated than it is. I pickled the rind the day before. Then assembled the salad the next day. Simple and delish!",

Everyone loved it from the 2 year old to the 80 year old!  My 3 teenagers in particular are asking to make it again.  So glad I took a chance on this.  I'm sure it will become a family staple during watermelon season.\nI did slice the rind into thin strips instead of chunks.  I also pickled extra rind and the kids are snacking on that.  \nThank you for the delicious recipe!",
