Above and beyond the flavor, you're going to see what might be the best way to make ice cream without an ice cream maker. Quite often, frozen desserts that aren't made with a machine can have a weird, icy, crystallized texture, but not here. This stuff is incredibly smooth and creamy. Serve with fresh fruit.",

Using a double boiler takes a lot longer to get the mixture to thicken. Still, it was super easy to make - even when everything went wrong in the kitchen (hotplate stopped working, bowl cracked, didn't have a replacement bowl & had to use a saucepan), it still worked out perfectly! An absolute hit at our dinner party. The other half now wants me to try it with other flavoured alcohols.",
