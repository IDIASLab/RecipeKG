A friend and I made it concurrently he at least doubled the seasoning, I did as the recipe said (it's because of Covid and it's how we have a meal together, cook the same recipe over zoom and eat it together! Delightful!)  . We both liked it.  Here's what I would do differently in the future.  I felt there was not enough sausage and think it should be sliced into 3/8\" slices or so, not cut in thirds on the bias.  With the recipe the way it is  you get a bite of vegetable and a bite of a big chunk of sausage. By cutting the sausage into smaller slices each bite can be a mix of meat and vegatables.  Yum! I'd  also 1.5  to 2 times the sausage.  Also, no need to separate the vegetables and the sausage when cooking.  Slice the sausage and add in with the vegetables when you add it.  The moisture of the vegetables will keep the sausage from drying out.   Surprising how good this tasted.",
