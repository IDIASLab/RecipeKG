Also, cover the bowl with a glass lid or plate or something; it makes the potatoes cook evenly much better. 2-I used apple juice instead of wine each time, and it's been great.  3-I only use about 1/4 cup of water, so the marinade sticks to the potatoes better.  4-Once they're skewered, I salt them generously before grilling them. Delicious! Even the kids love them and ask for them at each barbecue.",

I skewered these with red, yellow and green peppers, marinating all. Unfortunately, while the cooking method was fantastic and this really was good, the whole marinade thing is kind of a waste of time. Even though I added extra seasonings and fresh rosemary, one wouldn't even know there was anything but plain potatoes.  As for the mayonnnaise, it didn't add anything to the flavor and only created an unbecoming \"deposit.\" I'll make these again, for method, but will probably only rub the potatoes with a little olive oil, garlic powder and salt and pepper.
