I thought they were very flavorful and were well received in my house. I am not sure that I would use this exact recipe again only because of the use of the sweetened condensed milk. I typically only buy it for specific recipes and since this only uses 1/4 tsp or so I will need to find a use for the remaining before it spoils. I also added just a little more mayonnaise for our personal taste. Thanks for the recipe!",
