        "description": "Zareshk literally means \"barberries\"--a staple of Persian cuisine. Absolutely love it! Known as \"celebration rice\" or \"jeweled rice\", this is often cooked for Persian weddings. But you don't need to wait for a wedding ceremony to enjoy it. This pulao is made with wild, red barberries (zareshk), which give the dish its jewel-like appearance and an exotic, slightly tart taste. It is usually served with chicken, as it is in this recipe.",
