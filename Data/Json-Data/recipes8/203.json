I made it according to the recipe but didn\u2019t have coffee liquor so I used all brewed coffee. I did increase the cocoa by about 2 tbsp as I like it dark. Very smooth and creamy and the taste was as good as my local gourmet ice cream store\u2019s. My husband and I ate the entire amount in one sitting. I have never reviewed a recipe before but this one is so outstanding that it should be shouted about. Oh, and it\u2019s really easy to make. I will be making this again soon.",
