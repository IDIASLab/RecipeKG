I thought it was ideally spiced with just a little kick from the jalape\u00f1os but overall very mellow. And to say I like its nutritional breakdown is an understatement. The only change that I ll make in the future is to increase the dill weed one of my favorite spices that I just would like to taste more (personal preference here). I live in Florida and seldom have to deal with cold temps so this is a soup that will be made year round for us. Solid recipe and will be made again.",
