Added the meat and seasoning and cooked under pressure for 30 minutes, then switched to slow cook until you are ready to eat.  \nThe meat is very flavorful, not overly spicy.   Perfect for tacos, taquitos or burritos.  I made this a day ahead of time, cooled and packed into mason jars.  The next day I skimmed the fat and re-heated the meat.

Take out the chuck roast, put on a plate, pat dry with a paper towel and season both sides generously with salt. Leave it on the counter in room temperature for an hour (do this with steaks also, it makes meat so tender and juicy). I cut it in large chunks and sear it before putting it in the slowcooker. It is torture smelling it all day, but so worth it!!",

                "reviewBody": "1/16/18 - Very good recipe for Barbacoa! Excellent flavor! Made as written and this will be our go to recipe for shredded beef for tacos, tostadas, taquitos, etc. I was a little concerned when I removed the beef and tasted the liquid alone. Once you put the shredded meat back in the slow cooker, everything comes together. I did not notice a strong vinegar taste and it was not too spicy for us with the amount of chipotles called for in the recipe. If you are hesitant to try this because of the peppers, reduce the amount by half should be ok, but we felt it was on the mild side as is. The only change I will make next time is to add more salt towards end of cooking. Thank you for the recipe! UPDATE 6/27/18 - Made this in the Instant Pot with 2 lb chuck roast, fat trimmed (Meat/Stew option for 45 min let natural release for about 15-20 min, then quick release). So delish and shredded nicely This time I used 5 + 1 really small pepper in adobo sauce (6 total) and the meat had a slight kick to it, but not overpowering. Slight vinegar taste did come through more, but not overwhelming at all. Might reduce the amount a little next time. Excellent recipe!",
