I used a frozen CAULIPOWER margherita pizza (instead of the 3-cheese) and I think the tomatoes gave it a nice bit of color (plus: tomatoes!)  The only other change I made was to leave off the bacon to make this vegetarian.  It's absolutely delicious and I can't believe I've never put Brussels sprouts on a pizza.  I have clearly been living life wrong for 37 years and today I saw the light.  \nNo more.  This was really quick and better-for-me version of my normal go-to frozen pizzas on busy nights and I suspect will make a good lunch tomorrow (keep you updated!)   \nMy oven set at 425 took about 16-17 minutes to get bubbly but I left it in about 20 and the edges of the Brussels sprouts got just a little charred and really brought out their flavor.  I also finished cooking my pizza off the cookie sheet, directly on the oven rack and will probably forego the sheet entirely next time.  \nSeriously.  So sad I've just now discovered this combo.  But onward I must go, armed with new, delicious knowledge.",

The CAULIPOWER crust was crispy after cooking, so you could pick up the slices (not an experience I've had with other cauliflower crusts)! The flavor was exactly what you'd expect from a cheese pizza - so the base was just right. What you do with from there is up to you, though I enjoyed the bacon & brussels sprouts combo since I like those things. This recipe says each pizza is 4 servings, but the box says each pizza is 2 servings and I have to say that's probably more accurate, although I did make it work by serving a lot of salad and fruits on the side - everyone was left wanting more! I really couldn't be happier about this product, I even craved this dish again the following week!",
