                "reviewBody": "Excellent! I will admit that I did not use the ginger. It may have been great but we don't love it and I didn't want to take the risk. Also, I only had 2 hours to marinate and that ended up being just fine. I will plan ahead better next time and let it go the full 8 hours. Rosemary seems to be the most common herb that is used with lamb so I was a little skeptical but the thyme worked great. 4 minutes per side and then 10 minutes of resting was perfect for the size of chops we had. I will definitely make this recipe again and might even get brave and use the ginger. This one is company worthy  yet simple.",

He barbecued them using Oak Wood from one of our trees that had fallen down. By far they were the most delicious and best tasting Lamb Chops we've ever had.  The best thing was they were homemade, and not from some overpriced resturau. Definitely will be making these again. Plus will use the mouthwatering marinade for other meat. Thanks for sharing your amazing recipe.",
