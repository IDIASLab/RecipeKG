The flavors didn't really blend well and I had hoped that the kick from the jalapenos would be a little stronger. I left this in the fridge overnight and tried it again for lunch. The flavors begs to blend a little better and instead of blueberries I had garnished it with banana peppers. The kicked I wanted was there and it tastes amazing.",
