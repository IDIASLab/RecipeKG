After a couple of tries, yielding rather bland tasting sausage, I realized that commercial sausage sits with its seasonings and preservatives, and possibly, flavor enhancers, in the grocer's refrigerator case for a long time. When you make this sausage, please don't skip the resting time in the refrigerator, because this allows the seasonings to bloom.",
