It tasted like water. Almost had me thinking I added to much liquid but I checked three times. You have to add more seasoning a tsp won't cut it.  I added about 3 tablespoons of chili powder, onion, garlic powder, cumin, salt and pepper(I like mine spicy). I also used a jalapeno instead of banana peppers.  Also put in two bay leaves and an extra can of fire roasted tomatoes and 2 tablespoons of tomato paste.  Now that's tasty!",

I added no additional salt and it was still plenty salty for us.  Used 1/2 the chicken and water it suggested, and added a can of black beans (rinsed).  The baked tortillas strips were an excellent addition, and the recipe made 4 big bowls (dinner size).  Didn't plan ahead so started with frozen chicken and broth and it took less than an hour on the stove.  I've made it in the crock pot also and it turns out  wonderful either way.

Couple notes: I added black beans, and used white corn instead of yellow (just am not a fan of yellow corn, personally); you can probably replace the enchilada sauce with salsa to cut down on the sodium; and I didn't use the two cups of water because I like my soups heartier.
