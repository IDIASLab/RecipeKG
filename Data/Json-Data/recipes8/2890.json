I know it's tedious to do that to every one, but if you're quick you can roll one while another is microwaving. Redampen the papertowel as needed. Using this trick, you will never have trouble with cracking tortilla again, no matter how dry they were when you started. Hope this helps some of y'all.",

If you have some pollo asada, carne asada, carnitas, or even just ground taco meat you can give it a second life as taquitos! They also freeze great too if you want to make an extra big batch and store them in your freezer for a quick dinner--just reheat and eat. \nI used some leftover carnitas sauted with onions until it was hot and crispy. I quickly fried each tortilla in a little oil so it'd by more pliable and not crack (this is a great trick for enchiliadas as well). When I rolled them I added a couple toothpicks to keep them from coming apart when I baked them. Served them with salsa verde, sour cream, and cabbage salad for a light dinner.",

To keep this easy, I picked up a just cooked rotisserie chicken at the market, then shred the chicken by hand.  For seasoning, I used a packet of taco seasoning, about a half cup of hot salsa and a tablespoon of cream cheese (I promise, super yummy combination).  I used Mission corn tortillas, which are very soft and flexible so rolling these was easy without having to warm them first. The biggest issue I had was only one side of the taquito gets somewhat crispy so they needed to be flipped then put back in the oven.  Also, the tortillas kind of cracked a little which may be the brand I used?  Regardless, they did taste pretty great and hubby liked them too.  These would be a fun \"pot luck\" kind of meal to bring to work or other party like events.",
