Didn't put a whole tomato in each one probably about a third. Also didn't add red pepper (store was out) and no peas because I don't like them much. Used tomato sauce instead of soup as others had suggested. Added a little dried oregano with the basil. I had about half a cup of extra filling at the end so I will probably use less of everything next time or use a bigger cabbage. I also didn't bother with toothpicks just put them seam-side down in the dish.",

Added dried cranberries to filling mixture - a nice counterpoint to the other flavors. Don't like tomato soup as a sauce so also made a quick tomato sauce by simmering 2 cans of tomato sauce with italian herb seasoning garlic salt pepper and a pinch of sugar. Will definitely make again.",

I used 1 (12 oz?) package of MorningStar Farms veggie crumbles (same as TVP just one less step). I didn't add carrots peas red pepper or wine to the filling. After cooking the onion and garlic I added some mushrooms as well (the rest of the stuff just seemed wrong to me - I was trying to make it closer to the meat versions I grew up with). I also didn't like the idea of putting whole tomatoes in the rolls so I just added a can of diced tomatoes the the filling. For the sauce I used the one from the Turkey Cabbage Rolls listed on allrecipes.com. It was okay but it would have been better without brown sugar as it was on the sweet side. All in all a LOT of work but yummy. Glad New Year's only comes once a year!",

Instead of using egg I added 2 tbsp flaxseed meal mixed with 4-5 tbsp water. I also did not add the peas because they did sound a little out of place in this and I'm not a huge fan anyway. Like other reviewers I used tomato sauce instead of soup. And lastly I used pressed extra firm tofu that I had run through the chopper instead of the veggie protein. The meal was great. As others have said as well even my 'meatatarian' hubby liked it! Truly a delicious satisfying meal that doesn't take TOO long to prepare and I even had some leftover to bring to work for lunch tomorrow!:)",
