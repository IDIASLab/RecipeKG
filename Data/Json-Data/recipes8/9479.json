        "description": "Inspired by the classic layer cake, these gooey-sweet cinnamon rolls are just right for a spring brunch. The addition of dehydrated potato flakes (A.K.A. instant mashed potatoes) makes the yeasted dough exceptionally tender, and helps to keep them fresh longer. Be sure to use a ripe banana for the bun's banana butter filling, as this will give you the most prominent banana flavor. Matched with brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, and pecans--this decadent filling is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. Meanwhile, the pineapple cream cheese icing is the perfect finishing touch.",
