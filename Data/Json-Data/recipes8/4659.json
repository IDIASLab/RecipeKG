I had frozen chicken breasts on hand so I seasoned them w/ a little bit of granulated garlic and Italian seasoning and I put them in my crockpot along w/ 1/4 cup water on high for about 3 hours and then turned it to low for another 2 hours. \nI made the sauce as instructed w/ the exception I added in the tomatoes along w/ the other ingredients.  Make sure you use a good quality white wine - I used Barefoot Pinot Grigio. This sauce is amazingly simple, packed w/ flavour and I plan on making it again!  Thanks for the share!!!",

Flavor on that alone was great! Made the sauce with these changes: Sauteed onions in nonstick pan misted with my olive oil mister. There's no reason to use so much olive oil. Added 3 cloves garlic chopped at the end of onion cooking time. I found the recipe to have too much pepper if you/your kids are sensitive to pepper. I used the amount called for but next time would reduce by half. Also used half the salt (and I'm a salt lover). I used chicken broth instead of wine as I happened to be out of wine (ack!) and did not add any butter in at the end. The flavor was so delicious and flavorful. I am someone who loves ALOT of flavor and was very happy with the recipe. I served the sauce over the chicken with veggie and salad on the side. The sauce was plentiful so I plan to use the leftovers tomorrow over some whole wheat pasta.",
