This tends to cook the prawns like ceviche. Then after grilling they were a little tough. I am not sure that this part worked as well as I would have liked. Maybe some wine and zest would be better. I will test this approach next time. They cook very quickly under the broiler so keep a close eye on they or you will over cook the prawns. I didn't strain the dipping sauce. I simply reduced it until I got a consistency I liked. I also used Serrano instead of jalapeno. Skewering the prawns was a little tricky. I am not sure if I did it as intended but it came out well. Next time I will take a picture and add it tot he recipe.",

You may want to remove white membrane inside pepper if you don't like so much heat. A few things to work out yet an over-all good dish but preferably with these changes (for us.)",
