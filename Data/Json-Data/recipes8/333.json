I used to make these all the time with my grandmother, now I get a huge basket of them for every holiday and birthday! In my grandmother's instructions, it tells you to sift some of the ingredients. It makes for a nicer batter, but I don't own a sifter and it's not particularly necessary, I used a whisk or a fork to turn and fluff the dry ingredients before adding.",
