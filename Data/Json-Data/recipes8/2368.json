That turned out to be: 2 Georgia peaches 2 nectarines 1 red pear about a cup each of blueberries raspberries blackberries strawberries (quartered) seedless white grapes (halved) and small seedless red grapes. The fruit mixture can vary it's the dressing that makes it magic. Lemon juice quantity wasn't clear to me so I juiced and zested 2 large lemons 2 small limes and 2 oranges. The juice added up to a cup and I added a half cup of honey to get the sweet-tart balance I wanted. 2 Tbsp of very finely minced fresh mint leaves seemed like enough. I hope to find chocolate mint leaves one of these days. I used only half of the dressing for that amount of fruit. This was delicious!!",
