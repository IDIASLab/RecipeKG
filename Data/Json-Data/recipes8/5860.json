I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using penne (what I had on hand) instead of rigatoni.  But the flavor was a little weak, the casserole was a bit dry, and some of the pasta on the top was hard, a result of overcooking I think.  I  know the chicken needs to be cooked, and maybe timing depends on the size of the chicken cubes, but I will try cutting back the cooking time in the future.  For our tastes, I would increase both the dried minced onion and dried minced garlic, maybe give it a little sprinkle of red pepper flakes, as well as just a splash of cream or milk.  But this is a good casserole that needs just a little tweaking.  This is a wonderful quick-and-easy weeknight dinner option, and I plan to try it again.",

I covered the dish in foil, baked at 375 for 15 minutes, removed the foil and baked and addition 5 or 10 minutes.  Oh, I also used Hellman's regular, not the lite which gets runny with heat.
