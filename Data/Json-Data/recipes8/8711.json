It did not allow me to adjust the timer to be less than a default of 14 minutes. As a result the chicken got a little burned on the bottom of the pot. Lost about 1/2 a thigh worth of meat from it being stuck and was a pain to cleanout. I made it a 2nd time using my dutch oven and the results were as tasty but the pasta needed an extra cup of broth.",
