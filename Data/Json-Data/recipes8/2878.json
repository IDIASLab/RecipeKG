                "reviewBody": "It's a little bit difficult for me to really rate this recipe truthfully since I changed it quite a bit. I was trying to make a soup from ingredients I had in my house and oxtail isn't one of my common grocery items. So I used about two pounds of stewing meat and a pound of ground beef. I also added significantly more cumin (since I love it) and a little more chili powder. I also added cooking sherry and garlic (both chopped and powdered). I also used beef broth instead of boullion and then used less water. Everyone that tried it loved it. However if I was to make it again I would cook the rice separately and add it to the bowl first and put the soup on top. With the rice cooked in the soup it made the bottom of the soup rather solid and the leftovers were more like stew. A yummy trick that I was taught in Ecuador (and works well in a soup like this) is squeeze some lemon into the soup in the bowl as you serve it and sprinkle with finely chopped green onion.",

You'll need more water, I don't like to add frozen veggies, lentils or rice. I do however, cook a mexican rice separately and drop a scoop in the individual bowl as I'm serving.  Lovely with a few sprigs of cilantro when you add the cabbage.  I also like 1 or 2 bay leaves.  I added a handful of cut fresh green beens because my mom used to.  She sometimes used beef shank instead of oxtails.  But I love it with oxtails!  Thank you for the inspiration...the weather is perfect for it.  This is comfort food for Mexican-raised families like chili is to Texans and other southerners.  Enjoy!",
