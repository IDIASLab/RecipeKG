However inspiration struck me and it occurred to me that because of its zingy flavor and tanginess it just might be good with raw vegetables. Just as I thought I liked it a lot better. Hubs gave it a whirl and agreed. So for us anyway this sauce was much better suited as a dip for raw vegetables than as a sauce for shrimp.",
