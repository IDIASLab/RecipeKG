Wasn\u2019t quite sure what the consistency was supposed to be, but it\u2019s a tender, moist cake with a soft, creamy, fudgy bottom (guess that\u2019s where the \u201cpudding\u201d comes into the title), but not like the consistency of a lava cake.  From a taste perspective, it\u2019s reminiscent of a really rich, chocolate brownie.  Whatever, it\u2019s very good, very easy to make, and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.  Thanks for sharing your recipe Melinda.",
