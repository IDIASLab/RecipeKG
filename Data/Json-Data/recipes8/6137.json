Wrap it very well probably using 2 or more pieces. Be aware that the first piece should be large so that all the meat gets wrapped in it with no air. The next pieces will help you control the shape of it. Good luck and happy cooking!",

                "reviewBody": "I haven't made this but after reading some of the problems some reviewers had I thought I would offer some recommendations. I find that the instructions as written are very vague. Liverwurst is a German delicacy and it's one of my husband's favorite things to eat (horseradish sauce would go well with this or sweet or spicy mustard). For a finer consistancy I recommend pureeing the meat mixture so it's not 'meatloaf-y' and crumbly; and to avoid the wurst from bursting in water SIMMER it on the lowest setting rather than boiling it. Boiling is too harsh for the wurst causing it to burst in the water. 48 sausage casings seem like a lot unless you're feeding a crowd so I would freeze the wurst in smaller portions and take them out as needed. Hopefully this helps some of the problems encountered with this recipe. I'm looking forward to trying it in the near future.",

I made according to the recipe but all of my sausages burst during cooking and all the flavor was gone into the water. I did make 2 larger versions using the method discussed by another reviewer and wrapping the larger sausage in cling film. I left tons of room for the sausage to expand after the earlier disaster. I also thought that this really didn't taste like liverwurst. There was very little liver taste and the texture was more like a meatloaf and very crumbly. If you make this recipe please leave a lot of room in your casings for this to expand. Also maybe make tiny holes with a needle to let some air escape. (I did this with the larger sausage and it seemed to help. Thanks for posting the recipe though.",

I realized while grinding the meat it was too course so I ended up pureeing it with blender for smoother consistency. The recipe is somewhat bland. Part way through making wurst I added garlic powder to remaining meat mixture which improved flavor. I have seen recipes that add nutmeg or allspice as well. I think the recipe needs a higher liver content in the pork/liver ratio but maybe that's because I used chicken livers which are probably milder in taste. Also be prepared grinding your own liver is gross and somewhat nauseating. Next time I will ask the butcher to do it. I have to agree with other reviews be sure to slowly simmer the wurst do not boil. I did not use casing I used plastic wrap which can be simmered in water with no problem and allowed me to make a larger log shape than sausage casings.",
