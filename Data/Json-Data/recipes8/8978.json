        "description": "This is a great recipe for smoked turkey. A barbecue grill is nearly impossible to cook a large bird. A smoker is best for this. I prefer hickory chips or hickory wood. Hickory generates a more even smokiness than other woods, and it does not matter whether the wood is green or seasoned. Mesquite, if not well seasoned, will generate a creosote type coating because of the sap that oozes out of the wood while cooking.",

Much easier and quicker (5 hours instead of 10 for a 12 lb free-range turkey). I knew I had a winner on my hands with the YELPS of joy from people who tasted the first slices of the bird. INTENSE smoky flavor (the applewood was a good choice). And the Pepsi-Cola and butter and apple and onion and garlic inside hit the spot giving it incredible sweetness. I brined this turkey first using a brine recipe I got on this site (with salt and brown sugar and rosemary (which I added)). This was one of the best turkeys I've ever prepared. The skin was very dark with smoke, with when you pricked it, it snapped. Inside the turkey was surprisingly moist. A definite hit. Almost sinister and alien it was so intensely flavored.",

Fyi- I use a electric brinkmann smoker.\n\nDon't use a brine if your turkey is injected with a soulution (butterball). 10 to 14 lbs is best. It will definitely take a mininum 10 hours (at 220-230 degrees). 1 can of cola or a 16oz bottle is plenty. I like a hickory/pecan wood mix (pecan is smoother). Don't smoke after the bird reaches 140degrees. degrees.I only baste every 3-4 hours when I check the wood.I also like to rub the bird with rosemary.\nEnjoy..It's the best turkey you will ever have!",

There were 5 other traditional turkeys at this party but ours was the only one completely gobbled up. One minor adjustment we made to the recipe was to add 1C apple cider to the brine recipe (out of this world brine) we found on this site. To complete the brining process we stuffed the turkey into a roasting bag (it was a tight squeeze)poured the brine into the bag and set the turkey in a roasting pan rotating the turkey every hour or so overnight. We chose to use applewood and cherry chips in our grill (we didn't have a smoker). Don't forget to smoke the turkey in a roasting pan and keep injecting the drippings back into the turkey.Yum. Thanksgiving 2019 If you want an out of this world simple and easy greens recipe cook the greens in 2 cups of chicken broth. The last 2 hours or so add \"all\" the drippings plus the apple/onion/garlic stuffing from your smoked turkey. Throw in a smoked wing or leg for extra flavor. The mixture has a great smoked not sweet flavor.",
