Fresh steamed green beans provide a contrast to decadent melted Swiss cheese and crunchy topping. A family holiday favorite throughout my extended family. You can prepare ahead of time, leaving 4 to 5 minutes to steam the green beans and add other ingredients. Put into oven right before serving dinner (we usually put it in while carving the turkey).",

This recipe was related to me over 20 years ago by a friend I met when we were both VERY pregnant with our first children in a childbirth class (Hi Nancy!). One day while on a walk with our new babies we started talking about holiday meals and decided to share our favorite recipes. I don't remember what I offered up but I'm sure I got the better end of that deal. Those babies are all grown up now but my family still looks forward to this casserole every holiday (and sometimes just because I couldn't resist some nice-looking green beans at the market). Doubtless this recipe had been around for a long time before I knew about it yet I wanted to share it as it had been shared with me. Next blanching the beans will result in a crisper bean.",
