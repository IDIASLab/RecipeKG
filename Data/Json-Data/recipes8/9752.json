        "description": "The idea for this dessert didn't come to me in a dream but I was trying to think of a better name for a Strawberry Posset (which is what this actually is) but since very few people know what that is, I am calling it a Strawberry Dream. I think after trying it you'll agree that the name is totally appropriate. The boiled strawberry-infused cream and sugar filling firms up into a luxurious, pudding-like texture that when sandwiched between strawberry puree and macerated strawberries, tastes like a dream! Even though the portions are a bit small, the taste is rich and a little goes a long way.",

Only change I made in the recipe was in the order of operations.  I cut up the entire quart of strawberries and covered them with the 2 T of sugar and then after the hour of maceration, just reserved the 2/3 cup for topping.  Also, this is super rich.  Can easily reduce serving size and pour into 5 dishes instead of 4.  Finally, it took one large lemon to make 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  Now I'm wondering how this would taste with other fruits.  Looking forward to experimenting.",

I cooked some chopped strawberries and sugar and water, and then used the immersion blender on them, strained the puree into a small bowl and placed that bowl into a larger bowl full of ice to cool it down.  Then I had plenty of puree for the 4 servings.  \n\nI also added diced strawberries in the bottom of the glass, in the puree layer.  \n\nI'm definitely going to make this again.  \n\nAlso, I might like some pound cake in it, cut into cubes and put in the glass, making it have more textures.\n\nAgain, this was really enjoyable.
