I have so many memories of summertime based around spiedies and salt potatoes being mostly raised in the same area of New York too...I have no idea why I never thought it could be possible to break this recipe down. I thought I'd be forever doomed to Salimedas State Fair bottle hoarding when I went there for visits. You get my first review, this really is a great recipe! On a side note...you'll appreaciate this, my boyfriend is from Long Island and I took him out upstate one summer and he found a spiedie booth and asked...whats a SPY_EDDIE? He fell in love with them too...not for the faint of heart. I'd say if you've never tried them only marinate them a day to see how powerful a kick you like, especially with small pieces of chicken it can be overwhelming to some. Wash it down with a cocktail? That helps too! Thanks again Joy!",

Everything else we followed exactly. I'm sure grilled would be amazing! I'm so glad I stumbled up on this recipe. Absolutely delicious!",

Instead of the mint, I added fresh rosemary, and did not use garlic salt.  I did crush 2 more cloves of garlic before I minced them, and added sea salt.  I also did one container with the white vinegar, and another with the red.  With the red wine vinegar I was able to cook the meat to 160 which is standard anyway and keep the moisture intact, not to mention it was a little richer in flavor.  I had rave reviews, and with the red wine vinegar ones people thought I stole Lupo's recipe.",
