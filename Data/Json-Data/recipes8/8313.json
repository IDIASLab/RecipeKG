My family loves the dark colored baked beans at BBQ restaurants down here but I have been unable to find a similar recipe.. until today. I had a 28 ounce can of Bush's Boston flavored beans so I adjusted the seasoning since the beans already had some flavoring in it. I didn't have any mesquite seasoning so we just went without it and I didn't have any dried mustard so I just put a squirt of regular yellow mustard. These beans are yummy! The BBQ sauce (I used Sweet Baby Ray's) made the beans a darker color and gave it a really good flavor. Thanks for sharing this recipe Aleasa. I printed it and will definitely be making them again.:)",
