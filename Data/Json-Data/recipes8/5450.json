So far, no one has noticed the avocados until I tell them, and the looks on their faces are priceless. It's entirely guilt-free, and an easy way to trick your carnivorous friends and family into eating healthy! Garnish pie with shredded coconut, if desired.",

Next time I think I will add more lime juice though (maybe even a key lime juice specifically) to give it more of that key like flavor. The avocados whipped up nicely so it really had a mousse texture. I also added shredded coconut on top which I thought was a nice aesthetic touch. You might need to play with the amount of agave and lime juice but overall I thought it was good!",
