Followed the instructions as written. Bake time was 11 minutes. Might be my oven or my inability to not make giant cookies. Crispy edges with chewy middles. The oats give a nice toothsome chew and the white chocolate compliments the spices. They are on the sweet side and I will probably skip the roll in sugar next time around. A wonderful fall cookie to usher in the holiday season.",
