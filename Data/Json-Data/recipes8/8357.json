I used chili beans and chili tomatoes as i didn't have the fire roasted. I also added 2 tsp of ACV as the other reviewer recommended. The ground beef I use has little fat so I didnt have any issues with extra fat juices.  We will make this one again!",

There\u2019s a whole layer of fat sitting there that could be eliminated.  I followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of using regular paprika and substituting Tabasco\u00ae for the chipotle hot sauce (just personal taste preference).  I did add about a tablespoon of cider vinegar which brightened the flavor a bit and added just a pinch of sugar.  Nice Friday night, post-Thanksgiving dinner.  Nick Wilson, thanks for sharing your recipe.",
