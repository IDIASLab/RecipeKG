Would suggest mixing just until everything\u2019s combined because that may be part of why they\u2019re not as tender as I hoped they\u2019d be.  Also, filling the muffin cups half full gave me small muffins, not much rise.  If I make this recipe again, I\u2019ll fill up at least 3/4 of the way.  I\u2019d rather have fewer full-size muffins rather than 12 small ones.  Cranberry-orange always is a great flavor combo, and it really works in these muffins.",
