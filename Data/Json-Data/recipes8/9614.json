I did, however, eyeball the amount of the ingredients (you could taste it to see if it's to your liking). Plus I wanted it to be a little spicy so I added about a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce and a few shakes of cayenne pepper powder. I also cut the time down to 7 minutes because I didn't want it too well done. This recipe is definitely a keeper and I will be using it again!",
