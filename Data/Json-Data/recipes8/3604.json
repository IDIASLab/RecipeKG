They were sticking to the point that in trying to flip them they were breaking apart so I had to pull them up before I got a real dark brown on them. I am new to the IP and just discovered how to change the temp on the saute method. Mine was set to the hottest which could have been part of the problem. I also left the peel on as I always do with Yukon's and that might have played a part too. The flavor on these is amazing and this is one I will try again with my saute function set on the lowest heat setting.",

We didn't do step 4 with half the potatoes and they were fine and much more appealing.
