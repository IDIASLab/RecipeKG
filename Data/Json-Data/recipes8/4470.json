It was very easy to make and you could make this with leftover cooked chicken if you had any.\n\nThe cornbread was where I ran into an issue.  The edges where it was thinner was great, but thicker areas were very very dry. I used a smaller pan so I did reduce the amount of cornbread mix. I would say reduce the cornbread mix for the usual size pan.. or add more BBQ sauce .  I am going to try this again with more sauce,",
