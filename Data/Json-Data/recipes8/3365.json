I thought the flavor was a little on the weak side so I tripled the cajun seasoning to my liking and just went ahead and poured the whole 8 oz. container of heavy cream in because it was a little thick for my liking (I wanted the sauce to cover the rice also.) Before I poured on the crab/shrimp mixture I sprinkled goat cheese over the fish & rice. FANTASTIC. Definately add the cheese for a more dimensional flavor.

Also to the sauce I added some grated garlic (cooked with the butter and mustard) hot sauce dill and a dash of worcestershire. This was quite good although I took someone up on the suggestion of serving it over rice and wish I wouldn't have taken away from the other flavors. Garlic salt added into the rub will also give the fish more flavor. Thanks for the recipe. Will make again!",

I added the parsley about a minute before it was done to help preserve is body.
