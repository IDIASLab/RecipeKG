Two-ingredient dough is packed with protein thanks to the yogurt, and is free of the preservatives and artificial ingredients found in many prepared doughs. Once made, you can work with it immediately. That means you don't have to spend time waiting for the dough to proof before you make a meal.",

I tried it twice and liked both, but the second time, I added a little sugar to bring out the taste of the blueberries more.  The balls this recipe makes must be huge because I halved the recipe and still got 10 two inch balls.  Tasty though.",
