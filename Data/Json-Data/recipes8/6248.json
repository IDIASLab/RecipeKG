I made a few changes to adapt to what i had, or could find at the local grocer, i could only find tamarind chutney, so i used that, i couldnt find muscavado sugar, so i used brown sugar, i used natural peanut butter, and added a bit of yellow curry powder to the sauce. It was too cold outside and my bbq was tempermental so i baked in a 375 oven until they looked done. SO MOIST. huge success and i would definitely make again!",

The peanut sauce could have been more flavorful perhaps take that into account if making this. Perhaps use twice the spice or an extra half of the spices/peanut butter.

Served it with julienne carrots and white rice.  The sauce was very good, and very easy to make hotter by just adding a bit more curry paste.  Definately a keeper!\r\n\r\nFor those who haven't used lemongrass ever, you may want to try the following:  Remove most of the woody parts, coarsely chop the stems and crush by hand to release the flavor.  Unless you have very very fresh lemongrass, you will just end up with woody slivers if you try to food process.",
