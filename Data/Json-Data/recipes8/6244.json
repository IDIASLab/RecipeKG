I cut the pepper down just a bit (I have small children) and I actually mixed up the glaze and cooked it on the stove in a saucepan and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up. I cooked the salmon on the grill without cedar planks but on foil and when it was 90% done I brushed the glaze on reserving some for rice and veggies. (I doubled the glaze recipe). It was terrific. I had a maple soy glaze recipe from Bon Appetite that I had tried but this one is going to be replacing it. Thanks.",

I used double couarsely ground salt and pepper and heavily rubbed the top of the salmon. I also put 1 tsp of ginger and garlic in the glaze mixture. I then lightly pan-seared the salmon in olive oil on one side placed the fillets in the oven on broil and basted with the glaze about 4 times for 10 minutes (I prefer my salmon more well done than not). It was easy and quick to make and my guests loved it.",
