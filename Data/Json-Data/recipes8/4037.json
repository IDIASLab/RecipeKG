It rose super high, so I'm glad I used the foil trick but didn't have it tight enough on one side and the dough spilled over the edge and baked on the side of my pan. I just cut if off when the bread was done and ate it, and it was moist, and really delicious! I made three changes: I used 2T honey instead of the Agave Nectar, I also threw in 1/4 cup unsulphured molasses which gave it a rich and delicious taste, and I upped the Xanthan Gum to 4tsp. I'm pretty sure this recipe would have been rich and delicious without my changes, so don't hesitate to make this one!! AWESOME!",

It's super moist. I can leave it on the counter loosely wrapped and it doesn't dry out. Keeps for a long time in the fridge. Makes excellent bread crumbs. Another plus I can make it without a stand mixer. I add the dry ingredients to the wet and when it becomes too thick to mix I add the beer and yeast gradually. It's almost too much for the mixer to handle but it's my only option and the bread comes out beautifully. I mix a bit longer then the recipe calls for to make sure it's blended.",
