Could be simplified.\" I followed the recipe submitter's notes for \"if you like your ground beef a bit more spicy\" and truthfully found that all of the seasoning didn't do a whole lot for us and that we had to add alot of salsa and hot sauce (along w/ typical garnishes of lettuce tomatoes and cheese) for more flavor. I think AR's Bill Echol's taco seasoning blend or a traditional packet would've been much more flavorful. Tostadas were just fine but to me they're just the vessel for getting food from plate to my mouth and I would've been OK w/ a box of taco shells. I will say that I've never schmeared refried beans on b4 adding taco meat so that was the most positive aspect that I will take (and recreate) from this recipe; yummy layer of refried beans squishing under the weight of the other ingredients was super thanks!:-)",

I used handmade tortillas and homemade refried beans. These are perfect for buffet style lunches so everyone can build their own tostada but using the beans as \"glue\" for all the other ingredients is genius. Once you try these you won't accept restaurant tostadas ever again! Thank you for sharing the recipe with us.",
