We prefer our breast grilled over stovetop and so grilled is what I did. My review is based strictly on the veggie portion of the recipe. This turned out great and screamed healthy and freshness. A tip on spiralizing carrots is that it works best by using only the fat end. I tried to make it work with the skinny end but ended up saving them for another use. Speaking of the carrots as written they are still pretty crunchy (that is how we prefer them) so you might want to put them in first and let them cook down some if you do not like the crunch. The onions too. Overall great recipe and I'm anxious to try it again with the thighs cooked in.",
