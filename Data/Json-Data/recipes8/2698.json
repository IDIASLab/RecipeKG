That being said, I was too burned out on cooking after Thanksgiving to stand there and individually heat and roll all of those enchiladas so I made some adjustments.  Instead, I used the shells to make an enchilada lasagna. For the filling, I added 1 cup of both sour cream & green chilies to the original recipe. I didn't bother to heat the shells since I wasn't rolling them.  I put sauce in the bottom of a 13X9 pan, then a layer of 6 overlapping shells, more sauce to cover the shells, 1/2 the filling, repeat to end with shells and sauce on top.  I topped it with more cheese and baked for 30 minutes at 375. Lazy, but delicious.",
