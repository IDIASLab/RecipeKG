        "description": "You know that something with a name like this is going to be good and this truly is! The traditional recipe itself is very simple but the method for making it is not, so I developed this \"cold oven cheater method\" which is much safer and easier. The end result is an amazing flavor and texture combination of fatty sausage links, crispy, puffed, and tender Yorkshire pudding, and delicious onion gravy. And the gravy is so good you'll want to eat it on just about anything (and everything!)",

Besides this little switch this dish was  surprisingly simple when prepping. I love the gravy\u2014 probably could\u2019ve cooked the onions a tiny bit more but I like more crunch, anyway. And wow, I\u2019ve only ever had popovers before\u2014 not yorkshire pudding, but I love the simple yummy flavor and texture of the pudding. Also I should add that my bratwurst went amazingly well with this. \nThey also popped and spat at me like in John\u2019s YT demo of this. But all of this turned out so yummy! I was also expecting it\u2019d feel heavier but it wasn't at all (sometimes heavy stuff makes me icky) an overall a wonderful dish! \nSo far every recipe Ive followed from Chef John has been a hit",
