I find that muffin tins are too small so I use mini loaf pans. I use 10 full eggs (mixed until frothy), diced veggies, green onion, salt and pepper, and meat(optional). Mix together and pour on top of hashbrowns. Sprinkle chunks of feta cheese, (fried and diced) bacon (i like them extra crispy) And any other toppings you'd like.... then bake. Turns out amazing. I make these and freeze them... if you do that, the best way to reheat is to put it in a frying pan with a lid covering it. With a little oil,  Cook on low until heated through. Then take the lid off and turn up to med-high and fry until bottom is nice and crispy. Serve hot.",

I diced the ham and pepper and some red onion and saut\u00e9ed them to soften a bit and ended up with ~ 3.5 cups of filling.  Scaling up from that I used 10 eggs, 1 cup of cottage cheese and 1 cup of grated brugge comtessa (random I know but were cleaning out the fridge here, remember?)  350 for 30 min. Used a fancy mold silicone muffin tin that wife got for a gift, another part of the inspiration for egg bites, and they came out kinda cool looking.",
