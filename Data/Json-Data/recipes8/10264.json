I had a lot of leftover ravioli filling that I needed to do something with. The filling had pureed roasted butternut squash, parmesan, garlic, shallot, sage, and thyme. I used penne, and diced up some cooked chicken breast (for protein). I dissolved my ravioli filling into bubbling cream on the stove along with fresh sage, mixed with pasta and chicken, sprinkled more parmesan and crushed walnuts on top. It was delicious and my kid at 2 bowls. I will absolutely mix & match these flavors again.",
