I might increase the recipe a little tiny (TInY!)  bit for the 'shells' since I found it a bit hard to make them fill the muffin tins without making them too thin on the bottom.  I made 48, so having only 1 muffin tin was problematic.  Worth getting a second or 4th tin.  Maybe line the tin with a thin strip of parchment paper to help get the bites out without crumbling.",
