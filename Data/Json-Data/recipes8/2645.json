I marinated my chicken in Italian dressing before cooking - it added a great flavor to the pizza and helped to keep the chicken moist. I omitted the artichokes, (husband dislikes them) and instead sliced up a few Roma tomatoes to put on top of the chicken - I sprinkled the tomatoes with fresh ground pepper and salt. I used mozzarella because it's what I had on hand. I also mixed in some of a 3 cheese blend I had left over (asiago, romano, and parmesan) it added a nice punch to the flavor of the cheese. I used a Boboli crust and Classico brand basil pesto - it was VERY tasty. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand!",

I used a Boboli thin pizza crust, 2 cooked, diced white boneless chicken breasts, half a can of artichoke hearts sliced up, and Classico basil pesto spread along with an Italian blend pizza cheese. I used an entire package and another handful of cheese and added torn fresh basil leaves as well on the top. Thanks for sharing this wonderful pizza recipe Lisa!",
