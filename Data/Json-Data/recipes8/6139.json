I will usually serve over rice for a main dish with vegies.  \r\nI have tried cooking it several ways.  Outdoor grill stuck and the meat fell off the skewers.  Indoor grill (George Forman) worked great if you are only doing a few.  Oven works good for a large batch, but I have never had much luck broiling anything, so some were a little under done.  The last time I stir-fried in a wok.  This is the method I will use from now on.  All the meat was cooked and none was dried out or under done.",

Rinse the peanuts 3 times if they are salted then dry them with paper towels and dry roast them in a medium hot pan for 4 to 7 minutes shaking the pan several times until the nuts are no longer steaming and begin to aquire a color. Use low sodium Soy Sauce. But this recipe was delicious. The green onions were a delightful note. If you can grab your hands on 1 tbs of dried lemon grass and 1 tsp of fish sauce (in addition to removing the salt from the peanuts) you'd be giving yourself a treat indeed!",

I too did not read ahead and didn't realize that it needed to marinate. Went out for dinner last night and it was so worth it to let it sit over night. Didn't cube my pork I cut my loin into very thin chops. That was the only difference in what I did for the most part. One half of my grill cooks hotter so a few of them were slightly burnt. This changes the flavor altogether and is enjoyable also. My daughter that won't touch food that has the smallest hint of black on it wouldn't trade in her burnt piece. We used our cook marinade for our rice instead of dipping our pork in it.",
