When melting the caramel and dipping the cookie in the caramel the cookies slid of the stick I had really bad difficulty getting the caramel on the cookies rolling them in the pecans didn't work out so well. I managed to get them all done but it was not the easiest thing in the world It definitely takes some patience.",
