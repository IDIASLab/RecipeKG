They are very fragile since there is nothing in the middle holding them together.  My first two collapsed. On my 3rd attempt I got a good sear on it so that I could flip it but the heat has to be so high that it burns the butter. On my 4th attempt, I didn't use any butter at all and that worked great. A little of the egg will run out from underneath the burger but if you have the heat turned up high enough you don't lose much. This was fun and one I'd try again with some tweaks.",
