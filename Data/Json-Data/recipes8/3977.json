This will now be my go-to favorite for special occasions. \nI had fresh pineapple, so I used that and had a can of it too. I drained the juice from the can to add to the liquid portion for the cake. I didn\u2019t have any cherries, (nor do I like them) so, I left them out. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. \nI will make this over and over again.",
