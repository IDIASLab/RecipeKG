I'm not normally a big fan of sweet sauces on meat, but decided to try this anyway because I love trying new recipes - plus this was quick and easy. Wow! The chops were delicious and I would serve these to company. The only thing I had to tweak was to add a bit of salt and pepper to the sauce to really make the flavors pop. The chops turned out super juicy and tender, but be sure not to overcook them. I did about 3 minutes per side for 1\" thick loin chops. This one's a keeper!",
