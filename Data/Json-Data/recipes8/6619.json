This cookie met 2 of the 3 requirements; Looked very nice & stayed on the stick (I used craft dowels they look nicer) were extremely easy to make but the taste was not very good. I tested them out on family first and everyone had the same consensus; very sweet and had almost a cornbread taste. I took the advice from a previous review and added egg because the batter was very crumby that was helpful. I also added M&M s to the cookies this didn t add much flavor either. Not a bad cookie just not very flavorful. I will continue my search for a great cookie pop recipe!",
