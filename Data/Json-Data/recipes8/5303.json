I also used a whole cane brown sugar instead of Stevia (I had no idea what was Stevia). The biscuits came out great! My coconut oil was in liquid form. I wasn't sure at first if that would work, but it worked great! I made a nutritional yeast gravy to go on top and they were delicious! Both of my sons, ages 4 and 9 months loved them too! Good recipe! Thanks!",

They came out as slightly sweet fluffy biscuits with just a hint of coconut and almond flavor. I did not roll out the dough but cut in the oil using my food processor then put the mix into a large bowl and quickly worked in the milk with a spoon. Then I made patties by hand just gently patting the dough into shape - worked very well and was quick. I also made a second batch (at the same time) using half coconut oil and half lard (from cooking bacon) and added some onions and bacon bits (I cooked cut-up bacon and onion in a pan before adding). And I did not have any more almond milk so I used buttermilk instead about 2/3 cup. They came out great too but I think the bacon flavor does not harmonize so well with the coconut flavor although everybody in my family still loved them. The \"original\" batch was a nicer more rounded flavor overall and if you add bacon leave out the sugar.",
