My attempt has generated a few tips: 1. grind just the coarser spices first; my food processor was just flipping the rosemary around and the finer stuff created a cloud of dust. 2. Wait a while before opening your machine until the dust settles. 3. If you have a coffee grinder (I remembered later that I have one set aside for spices ) that is a better machine to use.",

I did mix and match this recipe w/ the Italian Seasoning I, since the only difference btwn the two seemed to be the red pepper flakes, the use of Savory, and the use of sage.  I didn't have any Savory so I just added the sage (only 1tbsp) and the red pepper flakes  Only problem was that it was too spicy for my daughter.  So when I run out of what I made I will make it w/out the red pepper flakes and add it separately.  I used this to make two items.  The first was the fanned Potatoes recipe on this forum and the second was to make a spaghetti sauce.  I've always made my own, but used the store bought seasoning and this is by far much better.  My husband is not a huge Spaghetti sauce fan and he raved about it.  Will continue to use this in all of my Italian cooking endeavors.",
