I served this with homemade pita chips that were seasoned with garlic powder, sea salt and cracked pepper. Not your traditional hummus, but still very tasty! I am looking forward to playing around with some other additions. Thanks for sharing. :)",

If EVOO meant for saut\u00e9s is used then the end product is lacking in flavor.      I doubled the salt and pepper in this recipe for better flavor. Companies prepare chick peas differently in the canning process. To prevent a grainy texture I brought them to a boil and simmered them 5-10 minutes before adding them to my blender. Varying amounts of water are in each can. I advise pouring the water from the pan into a Pyrex measuring cup, blend your peas and seasoning then add water back as necessary to achieve a desired texture.Following these notes may give you the optimal outcome. The texture and flavor is great.",
