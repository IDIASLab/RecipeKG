So beets kale etc \"taste like dirt\". He could eat oatmeal raisin or peanut butter cookies for breakfast lunch and dinner but that's too much sugar and anyway it's summer now and the oven makes the house too hot. So short story long I am delighted to find this recipe and will make it as soon as I have all the ingredients. Just had to comment that I've been looking for a bar cookie/candy style recipe that calls for local honey (against seasonal allergies) nutrient-dense things like almonds walnuts sunflower seeds prunes raisins dried cherries blueberries etc. that are bound together with peanut butter or chocolate but contain no butter and eggs so the cookies don't need refrigeration. And doesn't heat up the house in summer. Thank you!",

The same could be done with the nuts although I'd add versus save a portion. Mis en place is definitely recommended for this recipe since I was afraid I'd burn the pb-honey-coconut oil mixture. However it wasn't too sticky at all! I used pecans and reduced sugar craisins b/c they were both on sale. I had all the other ingredients on hand. Definitely needed to chill the dish for more than an hour. The freezer firmed these up perfectly. Rich flavor and great alternative to junk food candy!",
