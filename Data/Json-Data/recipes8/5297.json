I would suggest melting the exact amount of coconut oil but adding it to the potatoes a little at a time because I did think there was maybe just a little too much there (hubby didn't). I also would go a little short on the salt for the same reason (hubby didn't think so). I did a small batch of these because it is just the two of us. I ran out of the one kind of onion so I used a combo of sweet and red onion and shallots. I think I preferred the shallots actually. And I'm not sure why pepper wasn't used but that's easily rectified. I'm giving this the whole 5 star rating in spite of what I've written because I know that these will be made a number of times in this kitchen! Thanks so much Joni!",

I used about 10-14 and kept all the other ingredient measurements as written. I sliced my fingerlings on a mandolin slicer to make them more even. Instead of using fresh garlic I sprinkled in garlic powder. After pouring everything into a baking dish I topped with a shredded Italian cheese blend and bread crumbs. Cooked at the indicated temp for 45 min and the potatoes were cooked but not mushy. Very good recipe. Will make again.",
