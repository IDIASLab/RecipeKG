My watermelon was very ripe and I did not have fresh lemon juice (just the kind you buy in a bottle), because I didn't have the best ingredients that could very well have something to do with the taste. Other recipes suggest mint, which I did not have, I think mint might add a little extra flavor to make it better.  I did add a dash of salt, vanilla extract, and honey.  It almost tastes like a watermelon jolly rancher.",
