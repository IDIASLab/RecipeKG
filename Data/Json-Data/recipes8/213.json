                "reviewBody": "7.5.19 Had to go to four stores to find dried blueberries (maybe dried blueberries just aren t a big thing in Florida) finally found them at Sprouts in the bulk foods section. Would suggest that you work fast when cutting the cookies because the dough softens quickly becoming a bit crumbly and difficult to cut without falling apart. Keep one cookie log in the fridge while you re cutting the other. They baked up nicely at 11 minutes with a texture that s just a bit chewy but the taste of a classic butter cookie you will have! Only one comment about the blueberries. They were hard to find and VERY expensive at 13.99 lb when I finally found them but I really didn t think the blueberry flavor popped in these cookies. If I make again I ll try using dried cherries (they d be a good partner to lemon) cut them into smaller pieces and that s a fruit that I easily can find (even at Aldi). These were tasty cookies even though I didn t think the blueberry flavor was pronounced and the lemon was subtle. They re easy to make and I would make again.",
