Also made it with SR flour as I was out of plain, so I eliminated the baking powder/soda & salt. This coffee cake is everything I hoped it would be; chocked full of blueberries, subtle flavor of bananas, with a hint of cinnamon. Who could ask for more? It did take a little longer to bake (actually I had to bake it for 45 mins) because it IS so moist. Be sure to check it with a toothpick if additional time is needed. When it came out, I mixed up the glaze (took about 5 teaspoons of milk for me) and drizzled it on the warm cake. While the glaze was fresh, I also added additional chopped pecans - yum! Although this is NOT something you\u2019d want to fix during the weekday because of the time factor involved, it IS DELICIOUS and well worth the wait!",
