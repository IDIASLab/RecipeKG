I tried 2 new recipes today and liked this one best. However I personally like to make fresh lemonade with around 6 lemons then do a simple syrup with 1 part sugar 1 part water and a bundle of the mint (or basil) leaves I boil it on high remove the bouquet and add the syrup to the lemon juice and pour in 1 bottle of chilled pellegrino water and serve chilled with ice. It is not too sweet or too strong and the mint (or basil) tastes so delicate with the bubbly water. Plus its kid friendly. Enjoy!",

An extra cool thing about this recipe was while I was digging through my utensils trying to find something to use as a muddler I found... a muddler! Magic! Who knew I had one?
