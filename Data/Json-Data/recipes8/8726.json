For those of you who are not familiar with Halal bowls, they are usually served at street carts. The bowl is typically filled with yummy aromatic rice and topped with chicken or gyro meat, then lettuce, tomato, and this white sauce I like to call 'crack sauce'. This recipe came to me one day when I was craving a bowl but didn't have any rice on hand.",

After about 7 minutes on each side, I took chicken, onion, peppers off the heat and pulled the chicken apart. We loaded that goodness on the fries (Alexa Sea Salt) - and added the white sauce. Soooo good - and the proof, we ate it all. Will definitely make again!",
