Unfortunately, there is snow covering my garden herbs this time of year so I resorted to using dried thyme leaves and rosemary (I ground the rosemary more fine in my coffee grinder). I didn't measure the seasonings, just sprinkled to taste. Very good! As others noted, it did take more than 20 minutes to roast - about 40-45 minutes to get a tender bite. The sweetness of the potato combined with the savory herbs was perfect! I love the coconut oil also. Yum!  I will make this again.",
