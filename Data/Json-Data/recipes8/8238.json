I may have not got the number of servings as I should. But no-one is going to complain about a bigger serving. To get the icing spreadable I had to increase the milk amount 1/3 cup. I layered the scrap cake and leftover icing in a plastic container and froze it. I will see how in taste in a month. Next time I will cut into rectangles for less waste.",

I followed the recipe ingredients, except substituted vegetable oil for the butter because I believe vegetable or canola oil makes better homemade cakes.  I didn't change anything in the chocolate frosting recipe except I piped the frosting onto the cakes. The mini cake idea is a cute idea for a special occasion. Sort of amped up cupcakes. Love that they are individual servings. But the next time I make this, I will probably leave it as a large sheet cake and frost and decorate whole then cut into slices. I will definitely be making this again.",
