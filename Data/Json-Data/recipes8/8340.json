I also didn't have plain yogurt so I used sour cream in the sauce.  I never expected my husband to like this but he loved it, too (he ate his with mashed potatoes instead of noodles - it was delightful that way, too!) I got about 16 meatballs out of one batch, also, if anyone is curious.  Could not love this any more - meatballs are the one thing I've been craving since giving up meat and these hit the spot.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe.  (I also made another batch of meatballs to use in meatball subs!)",

The recipe didn't state what temp to cook the meatballs and I recommend no higher than medium as I found the Impossible \"meat\" to brown quicker than real meat. This makes A LOT of thin sauce so to help thicken it I simmered for 15 minutes with the lid OFF instead of ON. I also ended up using more cornstarch with the 1/2 cup heavy cream to get it to thicken. I did not add the final 1 teaspoon of salt in step 5 as it was plenty salty without. Based on the other reviews and as stated in the cook's notes I used sour cream instead of yogurt and was happy with the flavor. The result was delicious tender meatballs packed with flavor!",
