        "description": "My favorite way to enjoy lemon meringue is with pavlova. The meringue base cools and dries out slowly, creating a crispy, crunchy crust on the outside which contrasts beautifully with a soft, sticky center. Topped with an intense lemon curd filling, fresh blueberries, and a homemade blueberry sauce, this dessert takes a little bit of time to make but is also simple and easy to pull off!",

It just seemed beyond my very average baking ability. I should have known that Chef John would demystify this dessert and make creating it possible. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow just as written. The only thing that I did differently was that I traced the bottom of a spring form pan onto my parchment paper, then flipped it (so the outline could be seen through the paper, but we didn't eat graphite) so I could get a perfect circle of merengue. I otherwise followed the directions exactly and it came out beautiful and delicious! If you're \"merengue-curious\", I would absolutely urge you to try this.",
