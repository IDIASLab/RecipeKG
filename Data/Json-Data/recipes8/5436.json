I think I will sub the flour for a little protein powder next time or just skip it altogether. Instead I just sprinkled some protein powder on the top (along with some cocoa) to give the illusion of sprinkled sugar. I'm not into sugar these days and these pancakes were perfectly sweetened with just the banana.",
