We eat a LOT of chicken and even though there are gazillion recipes out there it can sometimes get boring;) Followed recipe almost to a T... Used chicken tenders b/c that is what I had in freezer; drained the diced tomatoes not thinking but glad that I did after reading note about sauce being too runny - it was perfect. Also was skeptical about adding red pepper flakes so late in the game but it added just the right kick. Added salt & pepper when I added the pasta. This is a keeper in our house for sure - we loved it and I can't wait to have some of the leftovers today for lunch!",

The only real complaint I have about the recipe is that the sauce was very thin and wouldn't stay with the pasta. My daughter said we should have served it in a bowl. I thought about thickening it but then I opted not to as I thought scampi is usually a thin sauce I think. I made a technical error and went with orcchiette pasta which was not a good match at all. I wanted a different shape but that was not a good one. Loved the brightness the lemon adds to the sauce as its added at the end.",
