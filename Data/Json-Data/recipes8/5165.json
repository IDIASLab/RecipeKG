Sandwiches or served in a chilled scouped out tomato - or in any number of serving vehicles let your imagination guide you. Thanks I know a lot of us older children will appreciate this recipe.",

I had a hard time finding the Chinese hot mustard so I substituted Plochman's Premium Spicy Peppa mustard.

I also LOVE eggs so I put another egg in mine and used Miracle Whip for the Mayo. Will definately make again!!",
