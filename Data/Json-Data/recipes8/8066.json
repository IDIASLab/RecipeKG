Found the squash to be just under 1/2 the mix - recipe was very light and fluffy and flavourful. Was thinking I may decrease the mustard slightly and increase the dill - but it's ALL gone. Also of note light in the stomach rather than a heavy potato starch. This is my new favourite use of acorn squash. Thank you!",
