They ended up being a bit thin-walled and undercooked so I couldn't get the out of the muffin tin without them breaking up.\n\nThe second batch, I added more dough until the cup sides seemed thick enough and ended up baking them for 21 minutes total.  This batch came right out of the tin after cooling and were a big hit with our guests.  If you think there isn't enough cookie dough when you put them in the tins, I recommend adding more until it looks right to you.  This is a fun idea!",
