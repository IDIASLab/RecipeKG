It involves a few extra steps when compared to your traditional boiled beef dinner, but the payoff at the end is well worth the extra effort. By layering the ingredients in a casserole dish, each serving has the perfect proportions of beef, cabbage, carrots, and potatoes.",

I couldn\u2019t find Savoy cabbage so I grabbed two of the smallest regular heads of I could find on the shelf, and that wound up being about twice as much as I really needed. That\u2019s my own substitution though so I don\u2019t hold it against the recipe. \n\nIf I did have one thing to change though it\u2019d be to \u201cfollow your heart\u201d on how many carrots you really need. I used three as instructed and it was a bit of thought work to ensure that every serving at least got some hint of carrot in it. I\u2019d have used maybe five or six carrots to do it over. \n\nBut I can\u2019t argue with the results. Deprived of the bars and parades and other usual trappings of St. Patrick\u2019s Day, this recipe was part of the stay-at-home substitution and was good enough that, despite the effort, it\u2019s probably become a tradition in its own right. Just know what you\u2019re getting yourself into, particularly if like me you don\u2019t have a dishwasher.  I froze the leftover broth to use in boiling potatoes come Christmas or Thanksgiving.",

My corned beef wasn't quite corned enough, so I put a thin layer of stone ground mustard between the beef and the potatoes and that did the trick!\n\nNot the prettiest picture, but it's delicious.\n\nThanks for the recipe!\n\nLong time watcher, first time reviewer,\nJustin",
