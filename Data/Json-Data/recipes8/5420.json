I've been on a paleo diet for some time and this is by far one of the best alternatives for a dessert (and fudge of all things)! The creamy texture makes this fudge so decadent. I made this recipe exactly as stated but had to stick mine in the freezer because it was still very soft after 30 minutes. I'm keeping it in the freezer since it melts pretty quickly. Can't wait to try more with natural peanut butter and maple syrup for another twist! Definitely a keeper!",

                "reviewBody": "Fortunately I read the reviews with comments about the mixture being too soft before I made this delicious recipe. I tried cutting the amount of coconut oil in half and increased the vanilla to 1 tsp. I did not have almond butter so I used natural crunchy peanut butter (which is not Paleo). The results? Great! The texture was firm although it still needed to be refrigerated because it is too soft at room temp. One other thing I did was to heat the coconut oil and cocoa powder in the microwave just till it bubbles a bit. Doing this develops the flavor of the chocolate to taste more fudge-like. I let that cool till warm instead of hot and mixed in the honey then the peanut butter and vanilla. The mixture needs to be spooned into the muffins cups while warm or it will be too thick to spread out in the muffin liner. The next time I make it I may cut back on the cocoa by a tablespoon or two because the taste was a very strong chocolate taste. If I do I will also decrease the coconut oil so that the ratio is 1 part coconut oil to 2 parts cocoa powder.",
