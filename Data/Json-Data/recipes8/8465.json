Instead of cooking the sandwich and taking it apart to put the filling in I cooked each side open faced and then put the apple filling and then put top and bottom together. I just didn't think prying apart a melted cheese sandwich was a good idea. The flavors were all great together but I couldn't finish more than a couple of bites due to the mushy wet texture of the apple/mayo filling. I really wanted to like this sandwich but it wasn't my thing. Sorry. But as always I love cooking and got to try out a new recipe! Thanks Wife218.",
