This recipe was perfect. The instructions were clear and easy to follow AND the results were delicious! The only change I made was to add a bit of salt and pepper to the egg mixture. This simple and versatile recipe is a keeper. I plan to create lots of eggs bites using different types of cheeses and add-ins. Thanks for sharing! I\u2019ll definitely be making these again and again.",

I made a few minor deviations from the recipe. I used jarred chopped pimentos, used the trivet that came with my Instant Pot instead of a steaming rack, and covered my silicone mold with the plastic cover that it came with. The mixture was EXACTLY the amount to fill my 7 hole silicone mold, each slot to the top. They do puff up a bit, which I was worried about with my tight fitting cover, but it worked out just fine. These are quick and easy to throw together and they are delicious! I'm looking forward to trying other add-ins, and I'm sure these will become a regular breakfast item in this house! Thanks for sharing your recipe!",
