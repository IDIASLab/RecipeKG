Hers was a bit drier and more pungent this one is creamier and milder. Hers used green olives (like this recipe) rather than just the pimientos and I've found it hard to get recipes using the olives so when I stumbled across this recipe I just had to give it a try. I did leave out the green bell pepper and used 1/3 cup green onion instead of regular onion -- and it's terrific. I did everything according to this recipe except I used a food processor to blend the cheeses and mayo together -- and then I pulsed in the rest of the ingredients -- made things a lot more simple especially in light of how easy it is to end up with cream cheese all over your kitchen walls with a mixer. If I were to change anything it would be to use mayo to taste/desired consistency. Otherwise I have to say I might like this recipe even more than my mom's b/c it's creamy and more spreadable/dip-able and not as strong as hers was. And by the way -- this is SO much better than anything you'll buy pre-packaged at the store! Those spreads are far too sweet! FWIW this is a wonderful recipe -- I will make it again for the upcoming holidays! (I'm thinking about adding some crumbled cooked bacon too!)",
