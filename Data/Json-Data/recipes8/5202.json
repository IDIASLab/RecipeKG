I also skipped the pimento stuffed olives...I didn't have any and my family doesn't care for them. I found that the best way to make a nice smooth filling that's easy to pipe is to use my hand mixer to mash the yolks and then beat in the other ingredients. I made one recipe the first time and they were so good that Geranium and I just made a double batch. Thanks for sharing the recipe...these are great!!!!!",

I do know what I like though - and I liked these. Unfortunately I couldn't use hot mustard as the recipe called for- Hubs wouldn't be able to eat it.  So I used a couple of different spicy brown mustards.  I loved the bite and tang of the mustard but I think it was the combination of the mustard AND the green olives that made these so good.  In other words, these just wouldn't be the same without the green olives!  And they make these look so nice and dressed up too! The only thing I didn't like, however, was that the mustards I used turned the yolk mixture an unbecoming brownish-greenish color.  No fault of the recipe - I just must have chosen some weird mustards!  Since I can't use the hot mustard, I think maybe next time I make these I might use half yellow mustard, just to make sure the yolks stay a pretty yellow so they look as good as they taste!",

I made these early this morning to use up the remaining eggs before shopping day. It's got this whole sweet-hot thing going on. I can't have sugar and eggs are low-carb so next batch, I might leave out the sugar next time but that's a personal choice, not reflective of the recipe. I'm beginning to rethink deviled eggs....the last two recipes I made were AWESOME! NOTE: I couldn't find my cool tips to make pretty filled eggs, so I just scooped the filling into a thick freezer bag and snipped off the edge. Wa-la, instant piping bag.",
