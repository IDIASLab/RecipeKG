You'll often hear me say in these videos that what we're making is way better than what you can buy at the store and with this, not only is it better, but you literally can't get this at a store! If you've never done this before, I think you'll be surprised at how simple and easy it is-in fact, the hardest thing will be finding vine-ripened tomatoes.",
