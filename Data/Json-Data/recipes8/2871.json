                "reviewBody": "This recipe sounded like a good idea but after making it I have to say it was surprisingly delicious. Unfortunately the local grocer didn't have butternut squash in stock so I used a whole organic acorn squash (it was smaller than conventionally raised). The amount of garlic and onion seemed small so I minced 1 additional clove of garlic and probably another 1/4 c of onion. I also substituted grated vegan \"monterey jack\" cheese for the goat cheese. Usually I don't purchase or eat dairy products but I think the cotija cheese is essential for it's salty flavor- I probably put on closer to 1/2 a cup over the top. I rolled the enchiladas and put them in a baking dish instead of baking and layering the tortillas (ended up using 7 large corn tortillas). I may have used extra enchilada sauce- I just poured it over the top until everything was covered. I baked them at 350F instead of 400F for about 20 minutes and they came out perfect. My boyfriend said he wouldn't have noticed that they didn't have meat if he didn't know because they just tasted like delicious enchiladas. Our meat-eating roommates tasted and enjoyed it as well. If you enjoy spicy foods you may want to add some hot sauce or diced jalapenos to the squash mixture but although we usually like our food spicy the lack of capsicum didn't result in a bland dish.",

Stacked enchiladas are typical of New Mexican style except the tortillas are lightly fried or warmed in a skillet rather than baked and then dipped in red chile sauce (not enchilada sauce) before being assembled. I made mine this way and they came out great. Next time I'll add more spinach and goat cheese. I can't wait to make this again!",
