Slight changes I made: - I added garlic salt pepper and Italian seasonings to the flour mixture. - after adding 1 T of water it was waaaay too runny so I just added equal amounts of the flour until it was a nice dough - I cooked it in light tasting olive oil because I don't like coconut oil Note: I used wax paper to roll out the dough. DON'T do it! The dough reeeeally stuck to the wax paper and it was hard to get it off. In any case THANK YOU! I really have been craving crackers for a long time. I'm sure I will try many alterations of these!",
