The second time I made it I used the grill and that was WAY better! Grilling cooked the meat well while keeping the veggies vibrant in color and helped thicken up the sauce instead of making it all watery like the oven-baked version did. Regardless of the cooking method the foil packets were an absolute snap to clean up after! As someone who despises cleaning I will be using a lot more foil packet recipes in the future!!",
