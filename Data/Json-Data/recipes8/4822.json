The taste the presentation the ease and make-ahead ability deserve nothing less!

I loved the mushroom sauce so much before adding the green beans I turned around and made it a second time as chunky soup! The family devoured it! I've since made it again with whole & powdered garlic regular mushroom soup and plain mushrooms... again a hit with everyone even added left over rice for a twist the next day!

It was an incredible hit. My family loved it and couldn't stop raving about it. You can make it the night before and just add the cheese the next day after warming. The only change I made to the recipe was to use turkey bacon in lieu of real bacon for kosher reasons. I will definitely make this one again.",

I made the recipe for Thanksgiving and it disappeared so fast that I had to make a second double batch so we could have more leftovers! Everyone liked the crunchy texture that the almonds gave. I substituted frozen cut green beans and used regular cream of mushroom soup adding a little extra chopped garlic. The second time I didn't have baby portabello mushrooms so I used button mushrooms; it wasn't as good with the button mushrooms. Next time I'll try french cut green beans (probably frozen) and definitely use baby portabellos/crimini mushrooms.",
