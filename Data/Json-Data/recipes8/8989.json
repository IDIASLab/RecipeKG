                "reviewBody": "This is the turkey recipe I used when I roasted my first-ever 19lb bird three years ago.  It turned out perfectly then and has every year since.\n\nMy version calls for placing the turkey on a v-shaped rack in the roasting pan.  This allows air to circulate under the bird and should address any issues related to the bottom not cooking as thoroughly as the top or being soggy.  I have never had to turn the bird over.   \n\nOther hints:  truss the wings under the bird with baking string or wrap in aluminum foil to keep from over-browning. For the rest of the turkey, I place the aluminum foil tightly over the breast-portion only.  Then, I remove the foil on the breast 1 hour before the bird is done (my 19lb birds, stuffed, tend to roast in about 5 hours, so I remove at the 4 hour mark).  The breast is always beautifully brown and not overdone; very juicy!  Baste as directed (every 30 minutes) with turkey or chicken stock.  When you check the temperature, be sure you're not hitting the bone; keep it in the fleshy part of the thigh meat.  I also check the internal temperature of the stuffing to ensure it's at 160.  \n\nStanding time is *important.*  I rest mine at least 30 minutes, up to 45. It won't get cold--keeps it juicy!\n\nI use good quality boxed or homemade chicken stock instead of turkey stock.\n\nThis is such an easy recipe.  You don't need to over-think it or second-guess it.  It's worked for me every single time.  And...the drippings make delicious pan gravy!  Enjoy!",

I also put butter under the skin as some reviewers do...  and use chicken broth.  Oh!!  and big ol chunks of onions and celery around, under and in the bird.  But (I don't recommend this method) I put my bird in on 250 degrees late late Wednesday night... don't baste at all, get up early and remove foil, baste REALLY well, turn up the heat to 375 until brown, basting often.  Always excellent!!  Frees up my oven, we wake up to the smell of *Thanksgiving* and it really sets a great mood for the day.  Have done this for years!!",

One tip for those who don't have a roasting rack and want to avoid the sogginess that is mentioned, place the turkey on top of whole carrots.  The carrots will keep the turkey above the broth, and this way you can use a disposable aluminum roaster.  I followed the recipie to a T last year, but this year I'm going to add some citrus in the cavity and some lemon zest and parsely to the butter.  This is a great recipie as is, but it is so simple that its easy to add your own flair.  The broth in the bottom is really what gets the amazing results!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great method. As stated in other reviews, definitely cover only the breast portion of the Turkey, and remove an hour before cooking time is finished. One helpful tip is to be sure loosen the skin from the breast, and actually place mayonnaise inside. I found that adding your seasonings and herbs, like sage, paprika, and garlic to mayo helps them to \"stick\" to the bird better while cooking - it creates such beautiful, brown skin, also.     I don't like to have to keep opening my oven and basting a turkey. Every time you open your oven, you can lose up to 20 degrees of heat! To get around this, I peel, core, and slice 1 apple (any variety that I have lying around) and slide the slices under the skin as well. The sweetness of the apple, as it roasts under the skin, handsomely offsets the saltiness, keeps the breast moist, and basting at a minimum. I still baste once or twice, with the drippings that accumulate in the roasting pan, but not nearly as often as I did in previous years. My turkey was excellent, and the gravy was wonderful.     Also, If you don't want to stuff the turkey with stuffing, place it in a separate pan to cook, and use turkey stock to moisten. That way, you can fill your cavity with quartered onions, more sliced apples, and celery, adding additional moisture inside, and enhancing the drippings and flavor outside. Hope this helps!",

I even set a timer to baste every 30 minutes as instructed. The turkey \"looked\" perfect like out of a movie or something. However after 5 1/2 hours of cooking this turkey was still not totally cooked.",
