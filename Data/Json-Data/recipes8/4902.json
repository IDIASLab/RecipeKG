I thought this made the recipe even richer, so next time I will use cheddar or Gouda cheese.  This is a very rich dish.  This makes alot of sauce, so next time I will use 2lbs of shrimp and more spinach and mushrooms and get 2 meals out of one recipe.  I don't think my family would frown over leftovers of this recipe.",

I will definately be making this dish alot.  Thanks Irene.",

So I put my cheese and 1/4 c cream in the grits... then added my chopped bacon.  I then sauted my mushrooms and onions in the skillet.  Added them to the grits. I had extra cheese so I added that along with the rest of the cream.  I then cooked the shrimp and just added it to the individual bowls.  I had a lot of grits left and no shrimp so I plan on freezing the grit mixture into individual grit cakes.  I will bread and deep fry them.  Then will make this sauce the correct way and serve with my grit cakes......Cant wait!",
