I used half the tomato sauce and maybe my chicken meatballs were too big, but 1 pound didn\u2019t make 30 meatballs. Overall recipe is a hit with the family! Forgot to garnish with cilantro for the photo, that would have made the presentation pretty close to perfect! I\u2019d rate higher than a 5 if I could!",
