They were so good warm out of the oven, I \"accidently\" ate 3 right away! ;)  I followed the recipe exactly as written, using unsweetened applesauce and unsweetened almond milk and frozen blueberries. The muffins had the perfect amount of sweetness for me (I don't like things too sweet), and I took the recipe creator's suggestion to sprinkle a bit of turbinado sugar and cinnamon over the top.  This is a nice mid-day snack or complement to my egg white omelettes for breakfast.",
