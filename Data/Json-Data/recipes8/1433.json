                "reviewBody": "I tried this recipe to try the fast and easy method it uses besides adding the far better real dried fruit rather than the glazed fruits. I must say that it is fast and easy. However, I would say that the flavor was too acidic and sort of salty. I will make it again given the fast method for macerating the fruit and rum and its practical mixing by hand method. I would highly recommend using sweeter juice options. If you like your fruit cake with a darker color add a bit of molasses. The texture was fantastic though. It was just the balance of acid and salt that seemed off. I may also lower the amount of salt. Will make it again with my own adaptations to balance the flavors more.",
