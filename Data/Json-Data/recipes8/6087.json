        "description": "A tried and true ceviche recipe to be enjoyed for a Sunday brunch in our cafe. It is believed by most Latinos that the best time to eat ceviche is on a sunny day. Rainy days cause stomach cramps and nightmares. Of course most Latinos (especially my wife) can make a good ceviche blindfolded on any day rain or shine, in my opinion. Excellent for an appetizer in smaller portions or as a meal itself. Personally I enjoy this with an ice cold beer on the side.",

I don't understand the reviews saying the shrimp never gets \"cooked\"-- maybe you need to add little more fresh lime juice? I think I use about 3/4 cup for only 1 lb of shrimp. ",

To cut down on time add lime juice to already cooked shrimp each chopped in half.  The lime juice is great for taste but I agree it didnt cook the raw shrimp well. Just use cooked shrimp.  I double the cilantro as well for added flavor and please don't eat these with saltines!!!!  Buy a big bag of lime flavored tortilla chips and serve in chilled martini glasses with chips stuck in the ceviche.  Classic and tastey.",

I halved the recipe and followed the ingredients exactly and it was plenty for a group of 8 people as one of many tapas. The only thing I did differently was throw the shrimp in a pot of boiling water for seconds and then into an ice bath before drying them off and mixing with the lime juice. I am always wary of seafood I get from the supermarket so I wanted to cook them a little bit first before serving them to other people.  The flavors in this recipe are great. I had the opportunity to attend a lunch and learn with the chef Rick Baylis and this Ceviche is just as good as the Ceviche he served as a first course. Thank you for such an easy and delicious recipe.",
