Make sure to place a baking sheet under the tart pan while baking--those tomatoes can make a bit of a mess when they burst open! They add quite a bit of juice, which can pool on top a little. I simply dabbed up extra juice with a paper towel and that worked fine. This is best served warm, on the day it's made. Garnish with additional basil, if desired.",

I pre-baked the crust for 10 mins because we do NOT like soggy crust.  Halved the cherry tomatoes.  Added two beaten eggs to the cheese mixture.  It was much easier to slice this way. BTW, this does not make ten servings; six at maximum.",
