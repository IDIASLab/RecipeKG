I had a hard time getting them to cook in the middle but I am a disaster in the kitchen so I blame myself not the recipe. In the end I just left them in longer and ended up cutting off the overcooked outer edges. The original recipe makes a VERY sweet bar. Most popular variation I made was: substitute chocolate cake mix peanut butter chips and salted peanuts. I also made a carrot cake version with white chocolate chips and chopped walnuts.",

My cake mix was a plain white one which is why I added the pudding mix and sour cream; was way too thick without that. Browned up beautifully! I do not have a jelly roll pan but I used a large cake pan and had to cook it longer therefore. Easy peasy! I will make these again and again so thank you so much for sharing this!",
