Although I did use canned salmon, I still mixed the butter, lemon juice and Cajun spice together and added to the canned salmon and served cold. I used canned tomatoes, rinsed the black beans (a must) and also added green bell pepper - What an appealing and tasty salsa! Served with homemade guacamole and juiced and grated lime added to plain Greek yogurt. A summer must make - no heat needed this way.  Thank you for this recipe!",
