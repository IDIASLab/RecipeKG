I'm afraid I can only rate the curd itself because I had a pre-made graham cracker crust in the freezer and opted to use it instead. (Honestly, pastry terrifies me.) \n\nBut this curd. Oh, heaven! I used blackberries from my yard so they were fresh and perfectly ripe. The tart was absolutely creamy and smooth, with a perfect balance between tart and sweet. The trick is to stir the curd enthusiastically while it's on the double boiler to keep it from clumping up. \n\nTop each slice with a spoonful of whipped cream and a few whole blackberries nestled in the cream and... *chef's kiss*",
