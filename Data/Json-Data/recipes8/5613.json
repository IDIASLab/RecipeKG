One problem I did have was I diced the tomatoes in a food processor and just measured it out as is.  I propose that if anyone else uses a food processor to strain the liquid out of your tomatoes before adding them to the bowl.  My loaves came out a bit too wet and one stuck to the pan and ripped in half.  Also, the edges come out so much better in a glass pan than a metal pan.  Very good!  Will make again!",

I made four batches of this with the green tomatoes I rescued from my garden before a frost and they were all amazing. We ate four, I gave away one and froze three.\n\nWhat I did was dice the tomatoes first and let them sit in a bowl while I prepped the pans and did the flour mixture. Then I drained the excess liquid from the tomatoes and continued. The loaves came out perfect when I did that.\n\nAlso it worked just fine using tomatoes that were starting to turn a bit pink, so if they're not all solid green, don't worry.\n\nMy favorite changes were half white/half brown sugar, half white/half wheat flour and the almond extract suggested by other reviewers.  I will make this every year from now on.",
