I'm confused . . . are these supposed to be like a funnel cake? The batter is SO wet, that when it hits the oil, it separates into a bunch of strands, kind of like a funnel cake. It was really hard to get a nice \"ball\" shaped donut, which is what I was expecting. Seems like the batter needs to be thicker, so that it holds together when dropped in the oil. I uploaded two photos - one plated nicely with the ones that were more donut like, and one that looks more like a plate of fried clam strips, so you can see what I mean. The taste was pretty good, but they are pretty greasy! Overall, not something that I'd make again. Sorry!",
