I cut the cheese and ranch dressing in half and omitted the bacon bits (also cubing the cheese instead of shredding it.) I halfed cherry tomatoes diced red onions instead of yellow onions quartered cucumber slices diced some fresh garlic and added it to the pasta along with a couple extra shakes of black pepper. This variation made the pasta colorful as well as \"as healthy as\" pasta and cheese covered with ranch dressing can be. The result with the veggie modifications was excellent and I would definitely make it again.",

Added: broccoli red onion diced ham cheese crumbles Omitted: shredded cheese green olives Will omit or use depending on purpose of salad: bacon bits I made this recipe Sunday evening and it sat in the fridge overnight and into the day before it was eaten. I'd recommend that. I'd use just the ham in the future for a weekday salad because by the next day the bacon bits were no longer crunchy. However if serving fresh those bacon bits are a nice little crunch. I used only about half a bottle of ranch. When taste testing it seemed like a lot and to keep calories down we stopped at half. However the next day the pasta had completley absorbed the dressing. That was interesting but overall the flavor was fantastic and I'd do the same again next time I make this. Everyone in my office wanted this particular pasta salad so be prepared if you are taking it to work. It was fantastic and all the colors were very appealing.",
