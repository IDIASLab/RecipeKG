Perhaps if I had used a different granola the results would have been better. I make my own granola and made a fresh batch before making these cookies so they were soft and chewy instead of crunchy. The baking time was perfect and the sweetness was just right but they were a bit heavy and dense. I prefer a lighter cookie.",
