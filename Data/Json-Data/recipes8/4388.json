I mixed this up in the morning to give the flavors time to marry with the exception of the basil. I added the basil about 30 minutes before serving so that it would be fresh. This is an outstanding salad with lots of flavor. It will be repeated in our house. Thank you blondeprincess for sharing your recipe!",

They are cherry size, so I cut them in half. I added a teaspoon or so of Aleppo pepper for a little kick. Let the pasta cool a bit before adding in the cheese balls! I served this with poached salmon topped with scallion ginger sauce, a green salad, and naan. For the pasta, I used pipettes which have openings large enough for the pesto to get inside, so good! This would be a good salad to have with bbq ribs or chicken.",

Instead of the mozzarella pearls I subbed a block of fresh marinated mozzarella instead and I sliced it into 1/4\" chunks. Since other reviewers said it was bland or lacking something I added some fresh mushrooms I'd cooked in EVOO and balsamic vinegar and they had a little tang which greatly improved the salad as a side dish.",

I had to boil another 1/2 cup of pasta and add little more of the rest of the ingredients to come up to a 6 serving amount. So be mindful of that when making this recipe.
