                "reviewBody": "This is a pretty delicious cake! It's definitely got the coffee flavor down--the whiskey doesn't come through much, but it's still tasty. The cake itself is interesting in that it depends on cream for the fat instead of butter. This created a fine textured cake--and one that is better suited to being slightly under-baked than over. The coffee-whiskey soak helps with that too. I baked mine in two 8\" square cake pans, and they needed 32 minutes to bake. The frosting was a bit different. I thought that maybe trying to mix the butter and coffee/whiskey mixture would be difficult--and I was right. Would not combine. So I would blend in the powdered sugar 1 cup at a time first, then add in the flavorings. Also, I barely had enough frosting to fill and cover the cake--and that's with bumping up the frosting recipe by an extra 1/3. I only needed a little bit of chocolate to drizzle over the top--6 oz left a lot leftover (though not complaining about having extra chocolate around). Overall, it's a different cake, and I enjoyed making it. Thank you for the recipe!",
