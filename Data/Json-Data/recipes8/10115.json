I used lemon pepper seasoning, black & cayenne pepper, onion & garlic powder in the walnut crust mix (maybe 1 tsp each). I also seasoned the salmon filets with salt, pepper, store-bought italian seasoning and diced yellow onions and let it all marinate for about 20 mins. After baking for 20 minutes, I set the oven to broil for 2-3 minutes (watch carefully- crumbs will blacken). I will definitely use this recipe again to impress some house guests.",
