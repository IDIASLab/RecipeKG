Essentially made per recipe with the following changes:  truffle salt and 5 modest cloves of garlic.  Used fontina, extra sharp cheddar and Merlot Belavitano cheeses.  This is definitely a 5 star recipe.  Just a heads up if you are using very fresh garden tomatoes:  be sure to let them drain.  In spite of roasting my tomatoes for 40\" and salting and draining the fresh tomatoes for about 10\", there was plenty of fluid in the pie.  I used a combo of heirlooms and San Marzanos.  Every bite was a delight to savor.  Very worth the effort.",
