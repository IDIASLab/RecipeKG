It was invented by the keto people, because they can't eat egg roll wrappers-but this guy can. So, instead of what's really egg roll filling in a bowl, we're doing the real thing in all of its tasty and textural glory. Garnish with more green onions if desired.",

Will need to use my chopper to get them more finely sliced and consistent in size. I omitted the wonton aspect; I didn\u2019t have any and wasn\u2019t running to the store.
