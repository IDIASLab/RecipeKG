This is a recipe that, while unique, is different from other store-bought egg nog that you will find around Christmastime. I had a craving to make egg nog, found this recipe, and made it. It's honestly a good drink, but if you're on a diet such as Keto or something that prohibits a lot of sugar, look elsewhere, 'cuz this egg nog lets you celebrate the Holiday season any time of the year with authenticity, at least where beverages are concerned. Bit of warning, though. Be sure to actually stir all areas of the pan while it's cooking. My whisk couldn't get everywhere, and the corners of the pan got overcooked.",
