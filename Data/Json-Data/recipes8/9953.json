Made with chicken breast (or thighs, or even leftover chicken!) and diced veggies of your choice, it's an impressive meal that takes just minutes to make once all the ingredients are prepped. The chicken is moist and tender, the couscous is light yet satisfying, and the veggies add color, flavor, and texture. It can be eaten at any temperature and would be perfect to pack for a picnic.",

Check the cooking instructions on your package. I also made this as a side dish and omitted the chicken but used homemade broth. This was quick, easy and tasty. The turmeric gave it a very nice color. The next day I added leftover game hen and had a nice lunch. Thanks Chef John.",
