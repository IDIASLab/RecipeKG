I also used dark chocolate chips in the ganache vs semi-sweet.  The recipe turned out great.  Although the cake was slightly dry, the ganache compensated to make a overall delicious cake.  It had a slightly crispy exterior edge, similar to brownies, with a soft interior.  I think the compliment of textures was perfect for this cake.  Next time I make this I will cook for 45-50 min (vs 53min). I will make this again.",

I used Betty crocker brownie mix and Pillsbury devils food. the cake was no more dense or fudgey then if I had used a regular cake mix. Now this is a review on the cake only. I took someone's suggestion and didn't do the Ganache, just ate the cake as is. it was sweet enough but too dry. perhaps had I done the ganache it would've been better, but I doubt it as it fell apart on my fork. I ended up throwing the whole cake away and went with an older recipe I always use that doesn't use cake or brownie mixes, it's all from scratch, which was much better, moist and fudgy.",

I had some much cakes I have done to the neighbors who loved it too.  This is a \u201ckeeper\u201d recipe due to how easy it is to make and its richness.
