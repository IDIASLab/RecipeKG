I did make a couple changes based on what other posters suggested: 1/2 the thyme, cheese on top of the potatoes (prior to broiler), cream of celery soup, and a little extra salt and pepper.  Also, the store I shop at does not carry the Simply Potatoes mashed potatoes so I substituted them for another brand of refrigerated potatoes.  Very easy and cheap to make!",

I used herb and butter seasoned instant mashed potatoes and took the advice from other reviewers and topped it with cheddar and mozzarella cheese.

When I make this next time I will cut down on the thyme (think I might have put a little more than recipe called for) and definitely add more salt and pepper. Overall I recommend this!",
