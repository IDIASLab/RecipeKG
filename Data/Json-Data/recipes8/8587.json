After about 5 hours on high I noticed it was almost done.  If I had left it for 7 -9 as stated then it would have been mush.  I had to turn it off for 2 hours and then proceed as directed with the orzo and shrimp.  Keep an eye on this when cooking.  Great reheated leftovers.",

There just seemed to be something lacking about the flavor. Maybe next time I'll up the amount of Cajun seasoning I used in place of the Italian.",

I used a full tsp of salt instead of 1/2 and added about a tbsp of chili powder to give it a little more kick and depth. Also I didn't have any orzo so I used instant brown rice. The pros to this recipe are that it is very easy and a great example of slow cooker \"make it and forget it\". The cons (in my opinion) are that even with the added salt and spices it was still kind of bland. This is more of a \"mock jambalaya\" simply because a true jambalaya has a lot more kick and richness created by the roux and cajun spices. However there is a lot of room for experimentation with this recipe and I will continue to use it as a base and play around with it.",
