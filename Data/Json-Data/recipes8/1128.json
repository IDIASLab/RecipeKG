The only change I made was using Truvia\u00ae Baking Blend in place of sugar, otherwise, followed the recipe.  My husband thought they were a bit weak in the banana flavor, but my bananas were pretty small, so I think that may be the reason.  Regardless, they were delicious, plenty moist and tender, the perfect breakfast side kick to a cup of coffee, and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to make again.  For a variation, I might add some nuts or a few blueberries.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it\u2019s a winner!",
