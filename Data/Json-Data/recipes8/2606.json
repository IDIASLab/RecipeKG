The only complaint I have is the 12 servings size is a somewhat small size serving. I tried filling a muffin tin with this recipe (just to see what 12 equal amounts would be) the muffin tins were just under half full to get the FULL 12 servings size. Not very much...So I just double the recipe & everyone get more than JUST a TASTE Other than that IT WAS YUMMIE!:) Thank you for sharing this recipe.",

More sweet than tangy I\u2019d say, but It is SO easy to make, and we liked the crunchy apples and nuts.  Couldn\u2019t really taste the cranberry flavor much, just the sweetness. Reminds me of a recipe my mother-in-law used to make where she used canned cherries, pineapple, and pecans and served with her special chicken casserole. The recipe submitter said that sugar-free Jell-O\u00ae was suitable, so that\u2019s what I used. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
