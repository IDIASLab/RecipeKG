The saltiness of the chicken stock, umami from the fish sauce and sweetness from the squash and red pepper balance each other out perfectly. Once again Chef John's recipe and video make what looks like a complex recipe easy to follow. I substituted for delicata squash since the kabocha wasn't available at my grocery store, and it was perfect! Adding this to our permanent recipe book.",
