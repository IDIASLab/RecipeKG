Yes rolling them is time consuming so I tried them in three different shapes.. per recipe, in a waffle iron and baked in mini muffin tins.  The ones  baked per recipe... maybe a few minutes longer came out nice with a nice crunch. The ones in the waffle iron came out darker, had a crunch bit didn't have the nice  firm center of yumminess.. just crust. The ones baked in mini muffin tins taste just like the rolled ones to me.. with less hassle.   You can see the rolled ones in the red dish in my photo and the blue dish held the ones baked in mini tins.  Since I dont have little ones who care what they are shaped like, I'll use the mini tin since it is less work for me... I will make these again for sure",
