And the most important detail, don't cook directly over the flame. Cook with indirect heat according to the directions of your BBQ.  On my 3 burner Weber, I turn off the middle burner that lies under the chicken.  You can also place a pan of seasoned liquid under the chicken to catch the fat and moist season the food.  I recommend wine, apple juice, etc.",

Although the recipe did not state it, I knew to tie up the drumsticks and wings to keep them from flapping as the rotisserie turned, thus turning to carbon.  I also knew that, when basting with a butter or oil based flavoring, you will have flare-up.  I thought about putting foil under the chicken, but thought previous postings that said \"do not deviate from the recipe\" knew something I did not.  Maybe it would be crispier.  When I went to put the second basting on, there was smoke streaming out from under the lid.  The skin was black.  A lot of the meat was overcooked.  The stuff in the middle was cooked perfectly, but I sent my daughter out to the store to get a pre-cooked one.  I will eat the meat I salvaged for lunch tomorrow ;-).  So, tie the legs, tie the wings, put down foil, and you will probably love this.  I loved the smell of the sauce.  Live and learn.  I hope you learn from my mistake.  Updated:  Another option is to turn off the burner under the chicken and cook it with indirect heat.  (I have three burners.)",
