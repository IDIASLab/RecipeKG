The night before, I coated the turkey with Kosher salt and let it sit over night in the fridge in a pan of water. The next day I rinsed the turkey off and followed the recipe but I also coated the turkey with margerine and Instead of using foil, I used an oven bag! Everything I changed up also enhances how moist the turkey will be! It was so moist that the meat fell off the bone!! So good! mmmm",

Well, my husband brought a free turkey home from work for Christmas, and I found this recipe. Today, we both got together to make this 15lb. turkey.\n\nI have to say, it's probably the best turkey I've ever had!!! We were a great team, (I prepared everything, but he got to clean out the turkey and stuff it). The turkey was in the oven about 3 hrs., then I opened the foil up for 30 mins. as directed. After it came out and sat for 15 minutes, the electric knife cut that turkey like it was meant for display; better than my Mom's on any Thanksgiving day. I called and told her we would make it this year.\n\nThankyou for a wonderful recipe even I can follow!",

                "reviewBody": "Well, seriously, I love to try new ways of doing turkey and this is, so far, the BEST!  It's hard to overcook this turkey because the meat is SO moist and FULL of proper flavor.  I mixed up all and lots of the herbs and rubbed the cavity AND 'under' the skin and over the skin.  In pouring the ginger ale or Champagne over the turkey be careful and don't pour much over because it washes the herbs off.  Maybe rubbing butter on first will help the herbs 'stick' so they won't wash off.  I think the champagne is better than the ginger ale only because we found the gravy ended up a 'bit' sweet from the pop and needed to be compensated by more salt and pepper.  Some people actually liked the slight sweet taste for a change.  No more brining the turkey.  No more turning turkey upside down.  This is simple, and the white meat is as moist as the dark and NOT dry.  We've cooked a lot of turkeys but this is a keeper.   That's not to say we won't try another recipe.  It's fun to experiment.  Enjoy.",
