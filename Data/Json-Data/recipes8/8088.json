I read the reviews prior to making these and I used 1/2c sugar instead of the recommended 3/4c. I personally like a little less sweet cookie. I also substituted pecans for the walnuts in the recipe. I refrigerated the dough for about 60 minutes prior to baking and that allowed the dough to set up and the cookies did not spread very much while baking\n\nThese sat on the kitchen island for a very short time before the kids devoured them. This is a recipe I will definitely be making again\n\nThe only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars vs 5 is that I prefer thinner crunchy cookie ... but that is just my personal preference. These cookies were delicious none the less.",
