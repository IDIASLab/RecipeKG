I also left out the coriander. VERY good :) will make again. I also doubled the recipe so I could freeze the leftovers. thanks! :)",

Everyone loved it including my two picky boys this will be a regular dinner here from now on. Here's what I changed: First I subsituted 1/2t of chili powder for the coriander mixed the sour cream in with the chicken and added a can of (drained) sweet corn to the mixture. I ended up using double the amount of enchilada sauce using 3/4 in the casseroll and the remaining sauce to top the individual pieces before serving. I used 6 8in. soft low-fat high fiber tortillas baking them at 450 for about 5 minutes before use. I also used low-fat cheese and sour cream. Even with all low-fat ingredients this was very rich and did not taste low-fat at all!",
