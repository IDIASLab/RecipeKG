I made my own baharat mix per an online recipe which was very easy with common spices. I made the recipe pretty much as written except I fried the cakes on an electric griddle vice broiling. Be sure to not overcook as salmon is much better moist. I think the recommendation to cook to 160 is overly conservative. Don t skip the aioli it is fantastic!",
