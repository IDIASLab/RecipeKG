First I should have chopped my ingredients previous to starting the cooking - I used fresh spinach mushrooms and a frozen chicken breast I had to defrost and cook. I started boiling the lasagna noodles far too early so by the time I actually made the rolls they were sticking together and some were ripped. The next mistake I made was doing the mushrooms separate - my boyfriend doesn't eat them so I decided to add them to only a few rollups for myself but the mushroom quantity ratio to the other ingredients was overpowering so they didn't turn out so well. Also the recipe says to boil 18 noodles and it makes 9 servings. I'm not sure if it's just me but I could only fit 12 rollups in my 9x13 glass pan. I made them by having the noodle flat adding filling along the middle and rolling it up so it was layered (kind of) and very fat! If it is supposed to be done another way please let me know! I think the best part of this recipe was the combination of tomato and alfredo sauces with all the cheeses - absolutely delicious! Hope this helps!",

A few tips to share: #1 If you cook the noodles ahead of time place them separately on top of wet paper towels to prevent them from drying out. #2 Cook the spinach and mushroom mix in white wine. It really adds a bit of great flavor #3 I thought it could use a little bit more ricotta and spinach. This is just personal taste however as I LOVE lasagna filling! #4 make sure the chicken is cut up really small to make it easier to eat as well as easier to roll up!! Great recipe!",

My boyfriend (who doesn't like spinach or mushrooms) had three servings (and I had two!)...I didn't use the pine nuts because I didn't have any. I used low-fat alfredo sauce and 2% milk mozarella. I also used a little more parmesan than called for (mostly because I wasn't paying attention when I put it in...but it still tasted wonderful). I served it with some homemade garlic bread. The marinara and alfredo go together VERY well...it gave the roll-ups a completely different taste than they would have had with either sauce alone. I will definitely make this again!",

The only change I made was to add extra sauce based on other reviews. I think this recipe could actually be made without chicken and still be good if you're trying to make a vegetarian dish. Next time I might add some caramelized onions to the spinach mixture or maybe sautee some garlic with it. This would be just to experiment and not because the recipe wasn't wonderful exactly as written. THANKS!",

Just my preference I guess. I like sloppy saucy lasagna. This may have been perfect if I had added a jar of alfredo (or even marinara) to the chicken/spinach mixture. Maybe even mix some mozzarella or substitute cottage cheese for the ricotta. That being said the second day I poured about half a jar of marinara on top and put it back in the oven and it was awesome. I was going to dump the leftovers but now I'm looking forward to having it for dinner again.",

(chopped saut\u00e9ed and squeezed dry) Used garlic flavored Alfredo and my boyfriend and I still thought this was just OK. Even the next day we didn't find it any better. With all those yummy ingredients we thought this was going to be a lot more flavorful. OH... and that prep time is way off. With all the chopping and cooking of the chicken and mushrooms... it was more like an hour prep!",
