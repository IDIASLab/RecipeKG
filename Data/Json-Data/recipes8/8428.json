I should have followed my gut feeling and reserved the separated fat to make a roux. If I would have done this there would not have been a floury taste. Do this by whisking the flour into the reserved fat over medium until golden, and then whisk back into the strained broth and drippings. I'll have to make my gravy tomorrow with my turkey drippings after all but maybe I can add this floury gravy to it. Hate to waste it but can't serve it the way it taste right now.

I used 2 turkey thighs, a back and roasted whole garlic cloves w/ turkey and added celery to pot- oh herbs de provence instead of thyme.  The only real change was as others said - I used some of the \"fatty\" stuff (the icky but good tasting stuff that floats to the top when it starts to cool) heated in a frying pan an added small abounts of flour at a time and a bit of chicken broth, then transfered to a jar with fitting lid with a more chicken broth and shook the heck out if it to make a thickening - then add that to pot.  I did this about 3 times and used the amount of flour the recipe called for and it was not floury tasting at all or lumpy.  This was suppose to be my back up gravy in case I had a holiday \"melt down\" or too much wine ha ha.  It was so good that's what I served with dinner! Just pop it in the microwave and pour in the ol' gravy boat! Thank you for saving me the burden of gravy after cooking all day!!  I've all ready given this recipe to all my freinds!!!!  Cheers!!!!",

Gravy at Thanksgiving is always such a stressful, last minute hit or miss and this one takes the worry away and delivers the great taste.  The only thing I changed was using turkey legs instead of wings because I think they impart a richer flavor.  Thank so much for this recipe!! A definite keeper!",

I poured the pan drippings into a gravy separator; The non-fat portion of the drippings went in with the simmering wings and broth, and I reserved the separated fat to make a roux. I did this by whisking the flour into the reserved fat over medium until golden, and then whisked in all the strained broth and drippings. No floury taste this way! Very excellent, and freezes well... To defrost, refrigerate for 2 days. Reheat in saucepan, whisking often. Yumm.  ",

I don't stress making the gravy after the turkey is taken out of the oven, the problem is, there is never enough turkey gravy for left overs.  We all love hot turkey sandwiches the next day, so this solves that problem.  I prepare this \"ahead gravy\" 2 days before and on turkey day I boil the giblets while the turkey is in the oven.  When the turkey is cooked and resting I use the roasting pan with the drippings and make a roux, etc, when the gravy is done, I then add half of the make ahead gravy to the pan and heat it up.  We now have plenty of turkey gravy for Thanksgiving.  The other half of the Make Ahead gravy I freeze for the Christmas turkey dinner, so I get 2 for the work of 1, and never again worry about having enough gravy left over for the day after hot turkey sandwich smothered in gravy.  I don't know if anyone feels the way I do but after cooking all this food for a holiday dinner, I don't feel like eating it, so the day after the big dinner everything sounds and tastes great to me, since I am not touching, slicing, chopping, stirring, mixing or smelling the food all day long, not to mention being tired and stressed getting all the food cooked and served hot at the same time  for everyone to sit and eat.  Nope, the day after is MY DAY and I'm loving that hot turkey sandwich.",

                "reviewBody": "Lots of great elements here, but in New Orlean's we'd change a few thins. 1st, we always start with a roux instead of belnding in uncooked flour. Try for the color of peanut butter or darker, and if possible use rendered turkey fat as the oil. After the roux is ready, add minced onion, garlic and celery along with spices such as puoltry seasoning, sage, thyme, or savory. When veggies are wilted, add the stock, bring to a rolling boil and reduce until thick. After you cook the turker, add the pan juices and bring to desired consistency by reducing on stove or adding more stock to your taste. I use a stock, rather than a broth, using the turkey necks, old veggie and poultry trimmings I've saved in the freezer as well as any combination of carrots, turnips, rutabegas, or yams. I simmer it (one bubble every 2 or 3 seconds) at least overnight (I have electric--wouldn't do this on gas) and strain as directed in recipe. This yields a strong, dark, flavorful stock. Another option is to add the neck meat and chopped giblets if you like a giblet gravy. It's really not as much work as it seems, and the flavor intensification is incredible. Kudos aplenty for roasting your stock ingredients and \"Bon chance\" (good luck)! Laissez les bon temps roulle (Let the good times roll)!!!!!",
