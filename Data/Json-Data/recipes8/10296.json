        "description": "These tender, autumnal scones serve as a tasty reminder that pumpkin plays savory just as well as it does sweet. Paired with toasted walnuts, nutty Gruyere and Parmesan cheeses, earthy sage, and brown butter, pumpkin shines decadently in these cheesy, buttery scones. They're best served the day they are baked, but can hold up well for 1 to 2 days in an airtight container; just warm them gently before serving.",
