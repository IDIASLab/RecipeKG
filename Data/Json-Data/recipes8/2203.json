My father would make meatballs the size of the top of his thumb (about 3/4 - 1\" diameter) then she would boil them in a little salted water just enough to cover. She saved the water to add to the soup (more flavor). The meatballs never fell apart and were just the right size for your mouth. We got about 40 - 50 meatballs out of a pound of ground beef. (She also used a dash of worchestershire sauce to taste) and mixed beef and chicken broth together then added a cup or so of dried vegetable soup mix along with approx 1 c. diced fresh carrots (1/4\" cubes) 1 diced celery stalk bay leaf to taste and rice. Served with fresh crusty rolls - we were in heaven!",

Some minor changes/suggestions: 1) I added an egg to the meatball mix (I doubled the recipe by the way). Just thought that would help keep them intact. 2) I would suggest that you err on the side of cooking the meatballs (my doubling the recipe made 32 by the way) in the skillet before putting them into the broth. Mine seemed to have a bit of a problem hanging together at first. 3) Try to use the leanest ground beef you can find. In my pre-blizzard foray to the Safeway all I could find was some fairly high-fat stuff.... Thanks Melissa! Good soup for a SNOWY day!",
