The turkey only sat in the brine in a freezer bag for 4 1/2 hours in the fridge and when I put it in the oven for just a little less than 2 hours at 350 degrees I didn't do a single thing to the meat. It turned out just great! I froze the bones from this and will do one more at least before Thanksgiving because I think this will give me the very best turkey stock for gravy on the Big T-Day! I highly suggest that people try this because it was extremely tasty. Thanks so very much Henry! Excellent!",
