I haven't used cocoa as an ingredient for brownies in a long time, but I obtained it specially for this recipe.  I didn't have expresso coffee powder and used a serving-size packet of decaf coffee granules(I know that they are not the same, but expresso coffee is not my thing!).  Making a meringue in conjunction with a brownie recipe was a little high-faluting for me, but it is necessary for the consistency of the batter and the flavor of the finished product. I didn't have mini-semi-sweet chocolate chips, so a few regular ones sprinkled on top worked just as well!  This is an incredibly tasty way to experience brownies.  I recommend it!",
