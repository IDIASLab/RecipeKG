I didn't really measure the lemon, just knew I wanted more.   \n3. I doubled the sauce - we are saucy people - and we served it with fettuccine so we needed more.  \n4. I only had enough heavy cream for half the sauce so had to use skim milk so it was very thin, even after using corn starch to thicken. \n\nCan't wait to make this again for sure but will make sure I have all ingredients on hand before getting started.",
