I substituted sugar for granulated Splenda and used 3/4 of a cup (this needs to be pulsed to a fine powder in a magic bullet for about 30 seconds... It reduces to about 1/3 of a cup). Beat it in gradually to the cream, eggs, vanilla and salt.\n\nAdded half a cup of almonds.\n\nBaked 30ish minutes, cut into 12, 190 calories per slice. Tasted amazing!",

They baked evenly and came out of the pan easily but the flavor is quite coconut-y and the texture is extremely spongy from all the eggs. I don't think they are good enough to serve to others who might be looking for a standard brownie. I'll be chucking these in the trash and making mini cheesecakes instead.
