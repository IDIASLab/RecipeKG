Maybe it's just me but it was sooooo gloopy that I could barely get it together and roll it in the parsley. I do think it needs more flavor--garlic and herbs. Ironically I liked it better the same day I made it not the next day. The sweetness of the french dressing had permeated the flavor by the next day and I am not into that flavor combo. I may make it again if I know it will be eaten the same day and with the addition of some ranch (or Italian) dressing mix.",
