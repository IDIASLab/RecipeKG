These also help to use up the fresh eggs we get everyday from our lovely ladies without tasting overwhelmingly like an egg. By far the best vessel to get tasty fillings into our mouths that I have come across over the years that actually are useable in the same fashion as a flour tortilla. We have filled them with nut butters and have also filled them with fajita meat and toppings. Both were delicious. We are going to try some whipped cream and berries next for a special treat!",
