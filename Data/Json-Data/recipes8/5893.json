I'd say 4 cups, at least, as they cook down. The only things I did differently are that I added about 1-2 tsp Cinnamon AND did a pre-treat on my peaches with Ever Fresh (or Fruit Fresh). Just added about 3 tablespoons to a large basin of water (large enough for 15-20 pounds of peaches). I also added 1 tsp. Ever Fresh per cup of sugar (I use a lot of estimating in my kitchen) in this recipe. I was working on a much larger scale than this recipe called for. My plan is for using this 'filling' for much more than just pie. I don't want to have to freeze this in a pie plate, so I don't want the fruit to brown when I thaw it. Will be using it for fruit topping on pancakes, cobbler, pie, and anything else I can think of. Very versatile recipe! Thanks!\nSIDENOTE: I did bake up one pie. It's nice. Wished I would have had a top crust and used a smaller pie plate. You live and learn.\n\nUPDATE: I used this recipe to make Peach cobbler while camping. I used the Peach cobbler VI recipe. I received RAVES from the camping buddies. Used in place of the peaches & spices in the other recipe.",

One suggestion though... the pie crust I usually use is a pate brisee and it has some sugar in it, so... the extra baking time required to thaw and heat the filling made the edges of my crust VERY brown by the 20 minute mark.  I covered them with foil to finish baking, but I would have done better to have covered them from the beginning.  Hope this helps someone!",
