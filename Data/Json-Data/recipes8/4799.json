I substitute pizza sauce for the marinara and place each grilled mushroom filled with the mozzarella and pepper mixture in a foil packet back over the grill for a few minutes until all is melted stem side up inside. I then serve each mushroom on either foccacia bread or Italian roll. I also offer a store bought gardinera relish. This has been a definite hit with young and old - and a \"sneeky\" way to get kids to eat something besides a regular burger at a cookout. This is a defintie keeper! Thanks Valerie!",

But my husband really liked them a lot so I will make again with some slight alterations. Probably I should follow the recipe to the letter.",
