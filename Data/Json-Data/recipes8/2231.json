I used Parsley (it was on hand) and orange bell peppers (they were on sale)... it came out very well very cool and mildly sweet flavors. The notes are crisp from the vegetables and fruits in the soup and no one flavor of anything stands out. I served it to the boys and they were in awe it was gone very quickly. I suggest you try it just to see how you like it! I was hoping the acidity would be brought down from the cukes and the watermelon so my only suggestion is to get the low-acid OJ I will make it again with the low-acid someday. Perfect dish for a hot day when you dont want to eat. I also saved a smidge in a bowl to be refrigerated overnight the next day it had AMAZING flavor. I highly recommend putting it in the fridge overnight.",

I followed the recipe except that once it was done it was a little too chunky for my taste and put it back in the blender for a very quick spin.",

Be as indulgent as you want without a drop of quilt. This became my new favorite food EVER. However I think I went overboard a bit with this one and I ate it so frequently I am ready to put this to rest until next summer! It's probably a good thing watermelon is seasonal. I did however add a whole jalapeno pepper and I mixed things up a bit and exchanged 1/2 cup of Pineapple juice for the Orange. And Mint for the Cilantro. I just submitted another version of this Gazpacho with the ingredients and changes I just described to the Allrecipes team hoping they will include the other version. The marriage of all the ingredients is an unexpected and exotic blend of flavors. This makes an excellent first course or surprising contribution to a summer pot luck. Deeelish!!!",
