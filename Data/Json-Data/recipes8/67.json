I put the bananas in the mixer and mashed them with the whisk attachment. Added whipping cream... and whipped again. Then the sugar, butter, egg, vanilla and whipped in between each. Then, I added all of the dry ingredients at once... whipped again. Stirred in the chocolate chips and put into the pan. I added the melted nutella, and swirled. \n\nIt came out to be the BEST banana bread ever. This recipe was so good!!!! I  definitely added it to our favorites for when our bananas need to be used.

The caramel sauce is delicious, and I'm looking forward to drizzling some of that over ice cream or even in my coffee! I made this exactly as directed, but my loaf was done at about 54 minutes, so keep an eye on the time, knowing your own oven. Toothpick in the center should come out clean when done.",
