I then poured them into carafes and stuck them in the fridge. GREAT to make your own Frappucino or Frappes at home in the blender. I just throw a couple ice cubes in the blender with half FF milk and half that day's old coffee with a couple good tbsp's of this syrup. I'd like to try this with a little SF chocolate syrup next time. GOOD STUFF! Thanks for sharing, Stacey.",

I used the calculate botton and changed it to 1 serving of syrup. From that I got 3/4-1 cup of it. The introduction on the recipe says to add 2-3 Tblsp to 8oz of milk and pour over ice. Based on that I got something that tasted and looked like lightly flavored milk. I had to double the amount of syrup to start to get more of an iced coffee flavor and color. As a result it took 1/2 the syrup I made which amounted to a lot of sugar/sweetened condensed milk per serving. Maybe this needs some more coffee added to the syrup to make it stronger so very little needs to be used. I think that would have worked.",
