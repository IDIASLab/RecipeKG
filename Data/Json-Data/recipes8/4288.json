I just think that would help the \"oily\" consitancy.  Thank you so much for the post, Angela.  Update:  Tried this with 1/2 mayo & 1/2 garden vegetable cream cheese.  Even yummier!",

I found this to be a fairly simple recipe.  I \"gutted\" my tomatoes using a knife to cut off the top and then hollowed w/my \"dash\" measuring spoon.  Per anouther review, I lightly salted the tomatoe and placed upside down on paper towels.  I'm not a big cream cheese fan, so I used equal parts light mayo and fat free cream cheese along w/real bottled bacon bits, a dash of garlic powder, and chives for the filling.  I used a Ziploc to pipe the filling into the tomatoes just prior to serving.  I will def make these again, esp now that gardens are over-flowing w/cherry tomatoes!  THANKS for a keeper!",

I made a few changes that I hope will be helpful...I cut the tiniest bit off the bottom of the cherry tomatoes so that they would stand up on the plate instead of rolling around. I substituted half of the mayonnaise with sour cream and I threw in a few chopped leafs of lettuce. After all what's a \"BLT\" without the \"L\"?!? Followed others' advice and salted the tomatoes before stuffing. Someone suggested using a pastry bag to flute the mixture into the tomatoes but I found that that created a big mess--the bacon chunks never fit through the hole (no matter how big I made it). So in my first batch I had a whole bunch of tomatoes with nothing but sour cream and mayo filling. Use a spoon or your fingers! My tomatoes were fairly small but I had no problem using the small end of a melon baller to de-seed them.",

They were very small and had a very tough inner \"wall\" right in the middle that I couldn't get out without ruining the tomatoes (even though I used my 1/4 tsp measuring spoon, which is metal and has a fairly sharp edge). This made them very difficult to stuff--in fact, I think a lot of them ended up wearing most of the filling as a \"hat\", so they were sort of messy, but I solved this by sticking a toothpick in them. Despite the problems, these were a huge success. I followed others' advice and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 cream cheese, and topped them with crushed croutons (garlic flavored). I also left out the parsley, and used chives instead of green onions. They were really, really good, so I'm sure I'll make them again, despite the PITA factor. Thanks for the recipe! Edited to add: These always go over well with everyone, but one of my friends in particular (who is not fond of tomatoes) is always dropping hints for me to make these again. They're always worth the trouble.",

Take the tomatoes and cut the top off...not the end where the stem was.  That way, they will sit on the plate without rolling.  I cut off the top and scoop out the insides and then turn over on a paper plate with a paper towel on it and let them drain while I put the rest of the stuff together.  I put the stuffing in a zip lock bag and cut a hole in the corner and that way it's easier to stuff the tomatoes.  Yum!!  ",
