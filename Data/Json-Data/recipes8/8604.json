It is so easy because you can throw all the ingredients in the processor rather than chop it by hand. I was running out of time to grate the lime zest so instead a squeezed the juice from one lime into the sauce - it was really quite good. My guests and my husband RAVED about it. Also my broiler doesn't work so I baked the chicken at 350 for about 30 min. after marinating (but boiling the sauce separately as the recipe indicates).",
