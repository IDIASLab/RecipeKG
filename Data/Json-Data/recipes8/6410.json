I was a little skeptical of the amount of Chinese 5-spice powder thinking it would overpower the ribs - NOT so! And the glaze is to die for! A perfect combination of flavors. I cooked mine at 225 in my smoker for 3 hours using maple wood. I then wrapped them in foil and returned them to the smoker for 2 hours. Finally I unwrapped the ribs brushed on the glaze and threw them on the grill til the glaze was caramelized and the ribs were nicely browned. These were fall-off-the-bone scrumptious. The bone slid right out. My guests all raved about these. Highly recommended!",
