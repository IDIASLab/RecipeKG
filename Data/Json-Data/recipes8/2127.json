Fresh-squeezed juice provides an upgrade in the flavor department (very fancy-pants), but dusting them in granulated sugar gives you that subtle familiar crunch you love about biting into the original.

I used lemon juice, so they tasted like Lemon Meringue pie, but the sugar on the outside reminded everyone of a classic peep.  However, I'm not sure why the recipe says to use 3 ounce packages of gelatin.  The only packs of unflavored gelatin I've seen are 0.25 ounces, so that's what I used, and it pretty much worked.  However, getting them out of the tin foil and cutting them was difficult and messy, though I'd generously greased the pan.  In the end it didn't matter because of the sugar dusting, but they were a little softer and less set than I would have liked.",
