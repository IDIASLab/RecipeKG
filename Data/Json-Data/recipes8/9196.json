        "description": "This method mimics the traditional time-consuming method of making cold-brew coffee in the fridge, but in 2 hours instead of 24! The warm water temperature is kept low enough to speed up the cold-brew process, but not hot enough to release the bitter, acidic flavors you get from hot-brewed drip coffee. The result is a super smooth brew that you'll want to make again and again. Use your favorite fresh-ground coffee for best results.",
