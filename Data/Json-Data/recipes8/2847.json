I browned the chicken breasts before adding the water and threw in some salt pepper and a little cumin. I skipped the tortilla-frying step as well just warmed them in the microwave. When the sauce was simmering I added more salt; not enough though the tortillas soak it up so next time I will keep this in mind. Like some others I also put these in a baking dish and threw them in the oven for about 15 minutes (@350) to melt the cheese. The enchiladas had a good flavor but hardly any heat (spiciness) so next time I will probably throw in a jalepeno. This would be a great potluck dish!",

I was worried about the poblano pepper sauce being even a little too spicy for Hubs but I needn t have worried. I can t believe I m saying this as Hubs and I have hyper alert taste buds but even we thought this had very weak flavor. Forget about spiciness or heat I don t care about that. I mean nondescript flat dull flavor. Salt helped some but even the garlic and onion I added to the sauce didn t do much. Nor did a garnish of fresh chopped cilantro. In addition we thought these were a little on the dry side and the mozzarella not the best choice for the cheese. Something with more character and complexity would have been better. Work with this to suit your tastes as I believe the sauce in particular has great promise.",

I added cilantro and cumin to the blender with the poblanos and other ingredients and added several dried red chilies to crank up the heat. I also put shredded mexi-cheese inside the tortillas with the chicken poured leftover sauce and cheese over the top and baked at 350 uncovered for 20 minutes.
