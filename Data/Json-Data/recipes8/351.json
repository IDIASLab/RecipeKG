Although this was not what I wanted to use, it still was tasty because the creamy chocolate chips which melted perfectly was more predominant than the flavor of the preserves.  This is EXTREMELY easy to make, the texture has good consistency, the crust did not crumble (as occasionally happens on bar recipes), not too overpoweringly sweet, and pretty darn good.",

Like another reviewer, I used fig preserves, and after tasting, I believe a stronger flavor would be much better, such as cherry or raspberry, with the chocolate.  This dessert bar has a shortbread-like crust, and I would have liked a bit more information about how to bring the crust together.  I love the honey-oat-almond topping!  It reminds me of baklava.  And don't rush.  Allow the bars to fully cool so they won't crumble.",
