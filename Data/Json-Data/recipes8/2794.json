I had enough chili gravy though for two pans although we used it all, it was a bit too much and the next time I'll cut that in half. I used an American-Cheddar shredded cheese blend. I didn't fry the tortillas in the oil, just heated them in the microwave to make them pliable. The second time I made these I did fry the tortillas which takes only a couples of secs per side except it is harder to work with a hot hot tortilla. I was afraid they would be greasy after the frying, but they turned out great after all. I also used half the sauce the second time and it while it wasn't plentiful, it was still adequate. Thanks Rhonda, this recipe is going to get a lot of use in the future!",

Brown your flour before you add it to the mixture and use coarse ground chili meat instead of the ground beef. Be sure to drain the fat from the beef. Do not add sugar! And your tortillas should be yellow corn and make sure you fry them in corn oil to the point of a slight crisp..reason being - the tortillas will become soft once you put them together. American cheese works best and I top them with diced onion before I put them into the oven. Good Luck! Jennifer",

The recipe says the flour is divided but I could never figure out why so I added the whole half cup to the 2 cups of water. The meat sauce turned out fine but the enchiladas stuck to the bottom of the dish. Maybe put some meat sauce on the bottom before putting in enchiladas and then pour remaining over top. Interesting idea for enchiladas but probably won't be a staple in my home.",
