        "description": "When I moved to Oklahoma from Florida, I learned &ldquo;Okies&rdquo; love their chicken fry. In fact, if you ask someone who has ever traveled old Route 66 from Miami (Okies pronounce this My-am-uh) to the town of Texola what's the worst food you can eat they'll likely say &ldquo;chicken fried steak&rdquo;. The best thing you can eat on Route 66? That would also be chicken fried steak. As contradictory as it may seem it's true! I tried to lighten this dish up by air frying, but feel free to grab a cast iron skillet and cook these steaks up too!",
