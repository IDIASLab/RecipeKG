My husband was rather put off when he knew there would be garlic in it, but the moment he took a bite, his face lit up. We both loved it! I used lime instead of lemon as we got a heap of lime on throw out and it was perfect. Crushed garlic from a jar worked fine also much to my surprise.  The butter was also lovely. I used unsalted.\nI will be making this plenty of times in future.",

Don't let the amount of garlic frighten you, it disappears as part of the blended finale.  Rec unsalted butter.  Rec sea salt for seasoning fillet(s).\n\nI'd suggest an easy going pinot grigio to go with and serve the pasta-salmon in the middle of the plate with spoonsful of steamed baby peas surrounding on three sides.\n\nLooks appetizing and satisfies.\n\nThis is a keeper recipe and a new family standard that we look forward to enjoying many times.",
