All the veggies got added to the beans, which I used as my stuffing.\n\nI also didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I used jalape\u00f1o instead of poblano, arugula instead of spinach, and taco seasoning instead of the other spices and salt. \n\nI served it with a simple arugula and avocado salad, some of my buddy's hot sauce and my very favorite Peruvian Green Sauce from my blog, https://confessionsofagroceryaddict.com.\n\nIt was DELICIOUS! My husband said they were his favorite stuffed peppers I've ever made, and I have to agree. YUM!",
