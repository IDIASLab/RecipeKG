It then ended up I babysat our Mexican friend's 3 children. So the 8 year old wanted to help me cook dinner. This recipe does take some work so it was nice to have the extra hands for stirring etc. She also taught me how to roll a \"mean\" enchilada in no time!! I didn't have yellow or orange peppers but it was still awesome. We will eat these again. We topped them with more sour cream and salsa. I did not heat the tortillas in oil we just popped them in the microwave for a minute to save time. All I can say is everyone loved these - delicious!",

Instead of the ground chipotle and ancho chilli powder I used 2 tbsp of pureed chipotle chilli's in adobo sauce. Instead of paprika I used 1 1/2 tsp chilli powder. I put two cups of the cheese in with the turkey meat mixture but the last half cup for over top. Also when you fry the corn tortillas use one or two tbsp of oil at a time. You don't need a lot of oil to soften corn tortillas.",
