I usually don't brine but decided the morning of Thanksgiving to give it a try and used the quick method (doubling the salt and sugar and letting it sit in the refrigerator for 4 hours) and it resulted in the most moist and flavorful turkey I've ever made. The other difference was that I used a fresh rather than a frozen turkey and it came out so tender and juicy, even the breast meat which typically comes out on the dry side. Even my mother (a very picky eater) enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!",

The gravy was so good (and I'm not a real big fan of gravy). I admitted to my husband toward the end of dinner that I had changed the brine recipe and his response was \"Well, looks like you found a keeper\". Definitely easy and definitely worth trying!",
