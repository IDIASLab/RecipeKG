        "description": "My husband loved a chicken and fennel soup he had at a nice Italian restaurant, so I developed this recipe over a couple years of trial and error. Now it's nothing like the original, but it's definitely one of our favorites. Friends and family rave about it. This is a great dish for company. I like to have this about halfway done when my guests arrive. We always end up in the kitchen anyway, and it's so easy, you can enjoy a glass of wine while you work. Serve in a bowl with a crusty roll and a dry white wine.",
