I am SO Glad that I did because I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ve made it this far in life without this DELICIOUS Drink! I LOVE All kinds of drinks with coffee however, I usually have to go to Starbucks to get something \u201cSpecial\u201d like this, but NOT ANYMORE!!!! I can drink this at home, in my jammies and it taste like it came from my usual Coffee Shop?? ?? I make mine exactly as the recipe says and PLEASE do NOT leave out the Vanilla Syrup!! It\u2019s the perfect finishing touch. Thank you so Much for sharing this INCREDIBLE & DELICIOUS afternoon pick me up recipe. God Bless & Stay Safe.",
