I also used a vegetable bouillon cube dissolved in 1/2 cup hot water rather than stock and added some fake meat crumbles. In some fresh corn tortillas it was delicious and all the garnishes gave it an interesting blend of vegetable tastes. It was just a little bit bland I'll probably spice/salt it up more next time. I never would have thought to make something like this. Thanks!",
