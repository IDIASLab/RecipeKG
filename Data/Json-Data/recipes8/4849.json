I basically used this as a jump-off point for all the fresh veggies I had sitting around that needed to be used -- a head of cauliflower bunch of broccoli carrots squash onion. Since I was out of tomatoes I used a can of tomato paste. Also used two beef bouillon and two chicken/tomato bouillon since that's what I had. I also wanted to thicken it and stretch it some so added about a 1/2 cup barley. So basically I barely followed the recipe at all... but I am of the opinion that it's hard to go wrong making soup. Throw in what you have throw in some spices let it simmer and voila: soup. This is a great starting point recipe.",
