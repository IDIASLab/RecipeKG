For the sauce, I used extra salsa verde and only about 1/3 of a cup of sour cream (that was plenty for us). I made 14 enchiladas, and got them to all fit in a single 9 x 13\" pan, and it took them about 35-40 minutes to bake. Would definitely make these again! Thank you for the recipe! Oh, and note to future self: 2 shredded chicken breasts is plenty of meat for this recipe!",
