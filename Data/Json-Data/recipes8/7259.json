I used my own homemade spaghetti sauce and weighed it to meet the ounces. We were pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I did use a bit more parmesan (not on purpose-oops!). I also left out the tofu because people in my house don't like tofu, but it turned out amazing. We'll be returning to this one!",
