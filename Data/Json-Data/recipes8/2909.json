I have my own and LOVE it! and I love this recipe. for a slight change try flour tortillas, and if you use the larger ones, they're easily cut and arranged to fit whatever pan/dish you use.

After a few years of making it myself and reading your wonderful reviews I wanted to add a couple of things.\nFirst, I use yellow corn tortillas which bring that fat and calorie count down even lower. I see so many people who've been happy with flour and whole wheat so it's certainly not a necessity, though. \nAlso, over the years I've stopped spreading the beans and sour cream. Instead I use a pastry bag to pipe them. If you don't have a pastry bag, use a plastic Ziploc bag with a corner cut off. (You'll probably want to warm the beans slightly so they'll be easier to pipe.)\nI'm so proud of this recipe and how it's brought joy to people I've never even met. Thank you all, so much!",
