I have been trying to pinpoint the ingredients for ages, I never would've guessed a pinch of cumin was the secret weapon!!  I also loved the combo of vinegars...balsamic alone is just too much for me.  I forgot to get a jalapeno pepper and didn't care to add bacon, but otherwise followed this recipe to a T, and it was VERY VERY good.  I rarely give 5 stars, but having this in my arsenal has made my day!!!",

Instead of using it as a salad we served it as an appetizer with tortilla chips. My brother returned to our house later in the day to see if we had any left -- it was that good! To make it a little healthier I substituted a cup of lowfat italian dressing in lieu of the olive oil and vinegars and omitted the bacon. Also substituted fresh cilantro for the parsley because that is what I had on hand. This recipe gets better over time so plan to make it at least 24 hours in advance.",
