The only recommendation I would make (my mother was raised in India, so she taught me): the difference between a good curry & a great curry is what my aunt called the broth. The broth is what is made with the spices & the onion. The curry powder (paste is even better) should be cooked in the oil until it is ready - usually about 5 minutes. Then add the onion & spice - cook until the onion is translucent. This will take about 10 minutes, but it makes all the difference in the world. Add more oil as the onion is cooking, if necessary. Then add the tomato (fresh is even better - strained) and cook it for a little while. NOW you're ready to make the curry. \n\nThis recipe was a HUGE hit with my family!",

                "reviewBody": "HELPFUL TIPS AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS: UPDATED If you've never had an Indian type cuisine, this is a GREAT one to start with because you can't screw it up!  The hardest part is just finding these items at the store if it's your 1st time.  Know you have to buy sweetened coconut milk, not the unsweetened kind & \"lite coconut milk\" for those weight watchers works well too!  When I add the stewed tomatoes, I use my spatula and cut them into smaller pieces.  Who wants a big chunk & who wants to end up w/nothing?  I find cooking it uncovered is your best bet unless you want it simmering FOREVER.  Uncovered at a steady med. will still takes 50-60 before the sauce thickens.  Any rice goes well with this, so just choose the kind you like.  I also only use 2 chicken breasts (1 pound), but keep all the other amounts since this is just for a family of 3.  If I used 2lbs, I'd definitely have to use more sauce if cooking uncovered.  Note: Expect your house to smell like curry 24hrs after you fix this (in case some of you have company coming over the next day).  We have this regularly, so I know!!! ;) This is truly the best!",

It thickened up VERY well - but I did let it sit on the stove and simmer for a while (maybe an hour?).  I just couldn't justify tossing out the water from the tomatoes, thinking I'd lose all those vitamins... I also only used 1 tsp of oil, light coconut milk, and extra curry.  This was GREAT!  It totally hit the spot! It's a great healthy recipe if you have veggies on the side (the coconut milk I used only had 6 grams fat per 1/2 cup!).",
