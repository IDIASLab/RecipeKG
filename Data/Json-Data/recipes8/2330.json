I'm a big fan of fresh fruit and veggies and this recipe sounded just different enough to work. It is such a fresh salad perfect for a summer picnic. If you like the sweet-salty combination then I think you will like this. The fresh mint is the key ingredient in my opinion. I could only find red tomatoes so I used those but I really wanted a color contrast. I found some tomatillos and decided to give that a try. The tart flavor of the tomatillos turned out to be a great addition.",
