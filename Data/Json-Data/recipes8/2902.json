I served this with my homemade salsa. I loved the simplicity of this recipe (the kids thought that tortilla pizzas were great) and it used the rest of a package of tortillas I had to get rid of.

He actually cooked both sides of the tortilla then we topped with the toppings the beans were so hot the cheese melts when you put it over them. We actually make this often but use flour tortillas in a burrito style so corn was a nice treat. I checked three stores and the largest corn tortillas I could find were only 5 1/2 inch but still worked fine. Oh almost forgot this was the recipe of the week selection. Thanks Lucy.",

I used the recommended grill method and after burning the first batch I lowered the heat and slowly browned them(it took about 10 minutes a side). I did both sides prior to topping them and did not replace to melt the cheese. The shells stored well until dinner and we just topped and served. No soggy crust.
