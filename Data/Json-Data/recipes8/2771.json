Like flour tortillas extra filling ingredients such as tomatoes and beans. Don't skip the cabbage though! Also stick with high quality fish sticks.",

I make homemade tartar sauce (with extra dillweed pickle & the key is a few dashes of worstechire sauce) while the oven is preheating so it has time for the flavors to meld. Chop onions & cilantro slice cabbage slice \"filets\" width ways and put all on paper plates. I heat up corn tortillas on a pan and keep them wrapped in a towel on a small plate while chopping & cooking. We assemble as we eat them. Fresh squeezed lime is a must and jalapenos if you like it spicy. We love to sit around and pork out on these with salt/lime rimmed Tecate. MMMMMM!",
