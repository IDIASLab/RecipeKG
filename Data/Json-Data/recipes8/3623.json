Here's what I do: I used just 1/2 stick of butter (unsalted ) and I also use the lower fat cream cheese (Neufchatel.) I also put the canned tomatoes into the food processor and pulse it a bit to chop up the tomatoes and give more consistency to the tomatoes when they are in the dip. I use frozen corn as other do. I just zap it in the micro for about a minute or two. If you can't find white corn yellow frozen corn works fine.",
