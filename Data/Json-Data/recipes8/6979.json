Don't leave out the lemon. I used parm instead of feta. I will definitely make this again---with the LID ON...;-)",

                "reviewBody": "This is a very tasty recipe and makes an excellent side dish for Greek Chicken or any grilled shrimp.  However after making it several times there are a couple of things that should be mentioned.  First, if you use 2 pounds of fresh spinach, you need a BIG pot to cook the spinach down in.  Once the spinach wilts it will be one tenth of the volume it started at.  But it takes a big pot told hold the fresh spinach for the first minute.  Of course using thawed frozen spinach solved this problem.  Second, I know of no rice dish that is cooked uncovered.  I cover mine and cook it for 20 minutes and then for 5 minutes more uncovered until it is thick and creamy.  Third, I like to add the rice when I add the spinach.  Allows the rice to soak up some of the flavor of the oil and onion.  Fourth, I sometimes add a couple of cloves of minced garlic during the last minute of cooking the onion.  I depends on what I am serving the dish with and if I want the hint of garlic or not.  Fifth, once the dish is done add 1 table spoon of lemon juice to the pot and stir it in.  This is absolutely mandatory.  Lastly, once you have plated up the dish, sprinkle a tablespoon of feta cheese on top of each serving.  The salty, creamy kick the feta adds makes the dish seem complete.",

I took the advise of the other reviewers and increased the water (to 3 cups) and added 3/4 cup of rice instead of 1/2. I had to increase the cooking time to 50 minutes (along with adding 1/4 cup of water twice in 10 minute increments for the last 20 minutes of simmer time)in order to get the rice cooked but it was well worth it! A nice side dish with chicken. Topped with feta and lemon juice totally make this dish outstanding! Thanks Kathy!",
