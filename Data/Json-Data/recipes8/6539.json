These are excellent broiled or grilled and served over rice noodles with nuoc cham dipping sauce, on top of steamed rice with a fried egg, or in a sandwich with a slick of aoli and lots of fresh Thai herbs. Baking powder is traditional and gives the pork its signature bouncy texture.",

I chose to bake in the oven at 350 degrees in the shape of small patties.  Made golf sized balls and flattened to 1/2\" as suggested by recipe if you plan to broil.  I did bake however on a pan that has drip slots to a lower level.  I simply preferred this method as opposed to making the kabobs.  Will keep making this recipe.",

I broiled these as long thin meat patties without using the skewer. A few minutes under the broiler and done! The only actual recipe change was to use tamarind paste mixed into the pork. More of a Phad Thai flavor profile. Thanks so much for a great idea and a way to use up some ground pork.",
