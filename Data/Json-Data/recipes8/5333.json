I used a can of garbanzo beans, drained & reserved the liquid, and ended up adding about 2 Tbsp of the liquid back to the hummus to get a spreadable consistency.  I felt fairly certain just from reading the ingredients that I\u2019d like this recipe, and I wasn\u2019t mistaken.  Layer upon layer of flavor.  I do think a healthy shot of Sriracha would be a god addition.  Do allow time to chill, as we thought the flavor improved greatly on the second day.",

I finally found Thai basil in a jar in the Asian section of the market.  One tip -- I made it in my Vitamix & had a hard time.  Next time I will definitely use the food processor.",
