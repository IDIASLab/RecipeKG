I made it exactly as written soaking the tortillas for 10 minutes and sauteeing the onions and ham for 5. I also used homemade tortillas (made from \"masa harina de maiz\"). Like another reviewer said this turned out as a bit of a scramble; I never noticed until just now that the recipe photo shows it served as wedges - I might try that sometime. This made two decent-sized breakfasts for me and certainly offers room for experimentation though it's good as is. Adding picante sauce salsa or the like on top of the results is a must in my opinion. I'll be making this again as it's a good way to use up extra eggs and corn tortillas.",
