The directions didn't include any steps using the rest of the chopped onion the chopped tomato the sour cream or the lime juice. I mixed the onion tomato and lime juice together and put some on each plate. Was that what the recipe author intended? I put a glob of sour cream on each plate too.

I do feel that the serving sizes are off- I halved the recipe and wound up with 4-6 servings despite the entire recipe supposedly making 4 servings. I baked the half recipe in an 8x8 pan. I made a couple of minor changes- my husband is trying to stay relatively low-carb so I used low-carb flour tortillas in place of the corn ones. After blending the sauce was a bit mild so I added about 1/4 cup of salsa and a small sprinkle of onion garlic and chile powders- seriously just a little sprinkle of each to push the flavor over the top. I did steam the poblano per the recipe and it worked fine although I have always roasted them in the past. We will definitely be making this one again and again!",
