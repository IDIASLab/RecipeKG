This changed the taste significantly. I used 1 teaspoon of mild chili powder instead. I also put a big pinch of sweet curry powder. I had no ginger root so I used powdered ginger. No cardamom pods so I used powdered cardamom. I had no nuts to grind so I didn't add any. I had all the other spices. I used chicken tenders instead of thighs. The chicken turned out tender and juicy. This is a very forgiving recipe. It didn't taste like the korma we get at the Indian restaurant but it was still delicious. My family voted 5 stars!",
