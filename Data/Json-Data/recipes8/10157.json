I also think you could sub fresh Basil for the chives if that\u2019s what you had on hand.  My only minor complaint; smashing the garlic clove and then adding the olive oil;  I get it! It\u2019s to infuse the oil but the clove pieces fall off the bread when grilling. The few bits that cling to the bread were delicious! Also - I did on a gas grill for quick results- especially since I only fired it up for this recipe/this step. I have never grilled French bread like this so that new idea alone I will copy again for other meals! Thanks again for the tasty side dish or appetizer!!",
