I did make 2 alterations. 1) I grated about 1 ounce of cheddar cheese and added to the mix. 2) After frying the first batch I decided to toss the tots into a small container of flour and lightly dust them before frying. This kept them from \"splintering\" and leaving lots of crispies in the oil. Next time I make them I will add only 1 tsp. of salt. They were just a little salty and I like salty things! Also I don't have a piping bag and a baggie didn't work for this so I simply rolled a handful into \"large cigars\" before chilling then slicing. Mmm anyway they were very tasty and I will make again.",

After making the potato mixture I seasoned with half the salt tasted and it was perfect. I also tripled the recipe. I didn't have a piping bag so I just rolled them into fat cigars. Rather than chilling them in the refrigerator I put them in the freezer got them nice and firm and didn't have much of a problem with them falling apart. I fried them in batches and kept them in the freezer until each batch was ready for frying.",
