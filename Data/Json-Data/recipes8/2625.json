I use a 30 oz bag of frozen potatoes shredded or o'Brien. Almost any size bag of prewashed spinach coarsely shredded will do. Powdered garlic and onion can work fine if used generously. I have never used milk in it because I use a whole dozen extra-large eggs. My mom who is 95 likes it plain my husband sprinkles it with cajun seasoning and many eat it with salsa. In an extended family of disgustingly finicky eaters everyone from 3 to 95 likes this! Happily for me I was told me about this dish over twenty years ago but I have never seen it in print before. You have done everyone a huge favor by sharing it Cheryl.",

My only complaint about this one is that the potatoes were so bland they detractred from the overall flavour. Try seasoning the potatoes with garlic powder Mrs. Dash and salt & pepper as they are cooking so they can absorb the flavors. I always add mushrooms with the onions and garlic and saute until the water has cooked out. I also omit some of the egg yolks (whites only) which allows me to add lots of yummy Swiss cheese without making the dish too decadent.",

Even though it was the first time I made it, I modified it slightly by adding fresh, quartered grape tomatoes, 2 strips of bacon crumbled and doubled the cheese.  My 3 young boys would never eat cooked Spinach and before I knew it, the whole thing was gone!  Oh, I also substituted the fresh garlic with garlic salt because I figured it would be more evenly distributed that way. Of course I eliminated additional salt. I will make this ALOT!! Inexpensive, healthy, quick  - and eaten.  What else could you ask for?",
