Served with guacamole sour cream & chives and salsa! Thanks for the awesome recipe! We'll have this atleast every other week!",

Ours uses cream of chicken soup (not mushroom) 1 stick of butter one large onion (chopped) 1 can of evaporated milk and only 1/3 cup of a can of diced green chiles. In our version you saute the chopped onion and green chiles in the stick of butter until the onions are clear. Add the soup and evaporated milk. Layer in a greased casserole dish: tortillas soup chicken cheese--until all ingredients have been used. Top with remaining shredded cheese. If you use flour tortillas they melt into the casserole. Corn tortillas retain their shape. Both are good...just be prepared for the difference in texture. never used Rotel tomatoes in it though.",
