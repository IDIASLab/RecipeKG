I have raspberry plants and a garden with zucchini so these are plentiful at this time of year. I also have an apple tree where I cook the apples down with no sugar added and then jar them for later use.",

Next time I'm going to use Craisins instead of raspberries. Also it was done after 1 hour 5 minutes in my oven.",
