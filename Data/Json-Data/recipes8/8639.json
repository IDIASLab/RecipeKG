A couple comments after reading your reviews: substituting an ingredient within the sauce will change the character of the dish. The orange juice mixed with white wine, tomatoes, and rosemary is what gives this dish a different taste than other Cacciatore recipes. This is not intended to be a thick \"hearty\" sauce. Feel free to add some tomato paste to give it a little body, but it's meant to be a \"runny\" sauce. The pasta or rice will soak some of it up, but it's a good idea to have a nice loaf of bread to dip in the sauce as well.",

Easily makes enough sauce for 12 oz of penne pasta probably enough for 16 oz. depending upon the ratio of sauce to pasta that you prefer. This has a nice mild flavor but is not bland at all. Be sure to top it with grated parm. Even my mushroom hater of a teenage son gobbled it up!",
