I was very surprised as I typically do not like peanut-flavored main dishes and halfway through making the dressing I thought I was going to hate it. I couldn\u2019t stop snitching the noodles even before I chilled them! I used the listed amount of spicy ingredients and it wasn\u2019t too spicy at all (my 3- and 1-year-old had no complaints.) I wasn\u2019t able to get soba noodles (or lo mein) so I used egg noodles and they worked. I used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy and skipped the peanuts, because that\u2019s what I had on hand, and that worked just fine. The only intentional change I made was to reduce the peanut butter from 3 tbsp to 2 tbsp, and I thought it was just right - someone who loves peanuty dishes will surely enjoy all 3 tbsp. One tip: I wasn\u2019t able to get the noodle dressing to whisk as the peanut butter wouldn\u2019t break down, so I put it in our Bullet blender. Next time I\u2019ll add the ingredients straight to the blender and save myself a dish.",
