Use a tiny bit of peanut oil or lard with the butter and fry it on medium heat. the trick with the plate does take a little practice but it is the easiest way to a real crispy, flat roeschti. Melt some more butter and oil/lard in before putting it back into the pan. Try covering it with (Raclette-) cheese (and 4 slices of tomato) and putting it in the oven for another 8-10 minutes on high heat... En Guete! =)",

Who knew it could be so easy?! For this recipe I found it important to keep a lid on the frying pan..I did this and found that the potatoes got a lot softer because they boiled a little bit more from the excess steam...I also like to mix it up a little bit so one time I added a little bit of chopped onion and sauted it in the butter before adding the potato..yum yum! To flip the roesti I simply did what I do with omletes...I waited until a nice crust had developed on the bottom and I could move it around a little bit in the pan if I shook it...I then slid it gently onto a plate flipped my frying pan over the roesti that was on the plate while holding the plate and turned the whole thing over while holding the bottom of the plate and the handle of the frying pan in one quick motion so that the top of the roesti was now on the bottom of the frying pan! Easy as can be!:) I also added some grated cheese to the top of it and stuck the lid back on while the bottom cooked - cheddar of course..mmm! That part definitely isn't Swiss..but I love cheddar..it's the best of both worlds! This has become a very popular and very asked about potato dish in our house!",

Good and I like the crust although it was difficult for me to flip on the plate--dindn't really work well for me. Not sure if that's something that takes practice or what. I may try again with less cooked potatoes and see if it ends up a little more like I imagined. Thanks for the recipe!",
