Did cook about 30 minutes more to finish rice,  but this is so good  and easy.  The directions are perfect. Can't wait to try with the lemon pepper and juice. Great dinner for a cold night",

I made it as written with 3 small changes: Used Bone-in, Skin-on Chicken Drums instead of thighs as that was what I had, and used long grain Brown Rice instead of white, which did require a touch more liquid and a little longer to cook.  I also added frozen mixed vegetables when I pulled it out of the oven for the first stir.  Everything came out perfect! and the seasoning was right on point!  I made it in the quantity published and have a ton of leftovers, which is alright by me as I can do so many things with the cooked rice and veg (Pork fried rice is coming later this week!)!! \n\nI am adding this recipe to my rotation!",
