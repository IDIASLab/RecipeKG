Then I placed 6 corn tortillas over the sauce and spread all the filling over the top.  I covered the filling with 6 more tortillas, the rest of the enchilada sauce, and the rest of the cheese.  I skipped the sour cream on top because my kids don't like.  It came out super yummy!  Thanks!",

I thought it was heavy on the enchilada sauce and sour cream, but light on the cheese, so next time I will use maybe 2/3 of the sauce and half the sour cream. I\u2019ll put more cheese on top as well. Overall great taste!",
