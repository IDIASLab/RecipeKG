That made them good guinea pigs as they weren't biased one way or the other toward my cooking. The end results: an appealing-looking plate that was totally different from anything other folks brought a perfect complement to the warm savory cheesy meaty dishes on the table and many many compliments and requests for the recipe.: ) The only alterations I made were to further chop the purchased chopped walnuts so they would adhere better to the goat cheese and to use Ken's Steak House Balsamic with Honey Salad Dressing. I put the dressing in a plastic squeeze bottle (the ones used for catsup mustard BBQ sauce) and drizzled it over the plate before serving.",
