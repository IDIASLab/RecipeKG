For instance, hubby can't deal with \"hot and spicy\" so unfortunately I had to leave the hot sauce out.  No matter--since I used brown mustard rather than Creole, I added a little Cajun seasoning, and that really gave this a boost of flavor to make up for not using the hot sauce.  A teaspoon of salt seemed an awful lot to me so I used 1/2 tsp. and it was plenty salty enough. Unlike some others, I did use both the olives as well as the capers, the combination of which was a real flavor sensation!  This was just perfect to serve with \"Perfect Crab Cakes with Green Onions,\" also from this site.",

Yes, for the long list of ingredients it looks like a lot of work for not a lot of pay off, but trust me you'll be glad you tried this especially if you're having really good crab cakes! Just to be on the safe side trying this for the first time I cut the recipe in half. I didn't have Creole mustard, so I used dijon and added 1/4 tsp. of \"Cajun Seasoning Mix\" from this site. I always have it on hand in a tiny tupperware container along wtih my other spices. I used some Frank's red hot for the hot sauce and also opted to add the capers which was a really good decision. I did however cut the amount of salt in half as the salt from the olives and capers really makes up for it. I let it set in the fridge for a few hours to let the flavors come together and boy was it ever good! This is a definite keeper!",

I eye-balled most of the ingredients, used regular mustard and some creole seasoning instead of creole mustard, bottled lemon juice, no salt and after tasting it, thought it needed more spice so I added a good squeeze of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (found with the Asian food at the grocery store).  It was still too chunky for me, so I put it all in a small blender attachment and gave it a whirl.  Next time I won't bother chopping everything and do this from the get go.  It was great the first day but the next day...WOW!  All the flavors melded together and it was just right.  The fish just SCREAMED for it!",

My only gripe would be that it has somewhat of a bitter taste to it (I think from too much creole mustard). I used all the ingredients but the olives and only about half the amount of salt and Louisiana hot sauce. I also used capers just because I really like them (about two tablespoons). To counter the bitter taste of the creole mustard I use only a table spoon and a half of the mustard instead of two and I add some brown sugar to it (five spoonfuls). It tastes much better this way in my humble opinion. I would say it is 3 stars without the sugar and 5 stars with it. Yes the sugar makes a BIG difference!! I do not make this sauce without it. This is an excellent recipe and will taste much better than any shrimp sauce that you get at a restaurant. Enjoy!",
