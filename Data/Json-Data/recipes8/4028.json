I combined several recipes I found on the web along with a gluten-free pie crust recipe I found. Although there are several steps, these hand pies are simple. Kids will enjoy helping with the assembly. Terrific warmed in the microwave with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt on the side!",

Worked in a little more water until it would roll out. Other than that the recipe worked fine and the turnovers are very good especially drizzled with honey!",

Tip: Use a knife to get the dough off of the surface you're using to make the pies I think my difficulties were in part because of the fact that I had to hand mix the dough and also had no rolling pin. Other than that this recipe was very easy. Just got these out of the oven they are SOOOOOOOO good!",
