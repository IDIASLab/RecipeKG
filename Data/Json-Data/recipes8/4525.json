I used about 1/2 cup less water because I boiled the sauce in the microwave and didn't want it to overflow. It will if you don't watch it carefully --so make sure if you do it in the microwave you use a big enough glass bowl. I added about 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar to the sauce instead of light brown and it gave it a rich flavor. What can I say but yum?!!",

                "reviewBody": "EXCELLENT RECIPE!  I made this last sat nite and it turned out wonderful!  The only thing I could say to make it easier and taste better, is when making the crust, you can use those ready-made pie crusts from the store, and you can make 2 (half an apple per dumpling) dumplings per pie crust, OR can use a whole crust if you want to use a whole apple per dumpling.  I only used 1/2 of green apples (gave great tart flavor with the sweetness) per dumpling, with 1/8 stick of butter and added brown sugar/cinnamon, and nutmeg to personal taste.  I cooked this for 50 mins at the stated temperature, and it all cooked thoroughly well.  When you serve this, don't poor more juice over the dumpling, this makes it too rich.  You do want to poor the juice over the dumplings before cooking, but not after.  The crunchiness at the top and cinnamon softness at the bottom with vanilla ice cream gives a perfect tecture of a warm & cold treat for the mouth.  Great for having friends over!  I highly recommend this recipe.",

She always used canned biscuits. So I substituted Pillsbury Buttermilk Golden Layer biscuits for the pie crust. I used 2 1/2 rolled biscuits for each apple. Wrapping each apple and gently closing the tops. Then I cooked in a 350 degree oven for approximately 50 minutes. The real secret is to keep basting the apples with your sauce about every 10 minutes to keep the crust nicely glazed, which will bake to a beautiful golden crust. I served this with homemade vanilla ice cream.  My husband says it is the best ever! This is definitely a \"MUST HAVE\" recipe. Thanks!",
