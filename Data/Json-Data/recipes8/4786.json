The flavors were incredible. (A white Italian wine was also served.) Also took a leftover mushroom and put it between two slices of the leftover garlic bread and ate it as a sandwich. WOW!

I thought the filling amount was too small for four mushrooms so I only used three mushrooms. That was a mistake because the filling has so much flavor that it could easily work for four mushrooms. My only complaint is that I down on the amount of salt but it was still too salty. Next time I'll use half the amount of salt called for or maybe even less. I'll be making these again.
