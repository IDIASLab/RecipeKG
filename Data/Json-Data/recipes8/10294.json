The type of hot honey used will have a big impact on how spicy your thighs are; the extra-hot honey has a kick to it. The chicken thighs have a thin smoke ring with a deep mahogany color on the surface of the thighs thanks to the marinade and smoke. Great on a biscuit with extra-hot honey or on a buttered and toasted brioche bun.",
