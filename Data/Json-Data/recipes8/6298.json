Mom would probably be upset that I gave it away, but it is so delicious that I think everyone should have a chance to experience it. Technically shish kabobs use lamb, so these should be called beef kabobs, but this is the family recipe and what we call it.",

I skewered the veggies (adding some cherry tomatoes) and meat separate basing the veggies with the reserved marinade.  Overall, very tasty!",

In addition, unlike some marinades with soy sauce, this didn\u2019t impart an oriental flavor, which I\u2019m not fond of with steak; another plus.  The flavors came together well with none dominating  another and with that good old beef flavor coming through.  I\u2019m a recent convert to marinades, preferring simply seasoned meats, but I\u2019d make this again.",
