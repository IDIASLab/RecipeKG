This was mine from last year.  The recipe is written using white chocolate, but you can use dark chocolate instead, or use half white and half dark.

And we decorated the cookies with royal icing instead of dipping into chocolate. And finally we made it a lot easier when we cut the cookies 1/4 inch thick instead of 1/8 inch. And instead of craft sticks we used barbecue skewers inserted directly into the cookie dough before baking. We do many many cookie bouquets and cookie pops and we never soak our skewers and we've never had a problem. Anyway thanks for a great recipe Robin.",

I tasted without the white chocolate coating and thought they were dry; but tasting a dipped and cooled cookie I found them to be perfectly crunchy and delicious. The icing didn't set as expected but I used powdered egg whites instead of the real thing. A 3\" heart is much too big; a smaller 2\" is the perfect size for school parties. Thanks for the recipe! I ll be making more this weekend!",

(I thought they tasted like cocoa-flavored cardboard). I suspect that the dryness may be necessary to maintain the integrity of the cookie as a lollipop though...if they were moist they would probably crumble. They looked great & tasted fine after dipping them in the chocolate so I will probably use the recipe again. I sprinkled mine w/ red colored sugar before decorating but no way am I gonna post a pic & put it up next to SugarPlumsCookie's.;o) Thansk for sharing the recipe Robin...my grands enjoyed them & I had fun making them.",
