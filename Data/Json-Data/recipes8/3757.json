The good thing about deviled egg filling is that you can tweak the ingredients to suit your particular taste - in this case I added more dressing pepper and sprinkled some red pepper in there as well. I don't know if I'd call this recipe \"spicy\" if it's made as stated. The Italian dressing did perk it up some however. A worthwhile try. Thanks for the submission.",
