There was quite a bit of fat in the pan after browning the chicken, so I disposed of most of it before melting the butter and saut\u00e9ing the vegetables. I used roasted chopped Hatch chiles instead of fresh and a homemade taco seasoning recipe from this site. The pan I used has its own lid, so I didn\u2019t need to cover it with foil. I think this helped keep the chicken juicy and tender.Try this recipe! You won\u2019t regret it.",
