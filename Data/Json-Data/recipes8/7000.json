The only issue I had with this is the sauce was very runny, even with doing the cornstarch at the beginning. I made a cornstarch slurry, threw the finished chicken and sauce in a pot on the stove, brought it to a boil and mixed in the slurry to thicken it. The taste was great, it had a nice kick. Both my kids enjoyed it, as did the hubby who got seconds. We will definitely make this again!",
