Well, it's a paleo recipe so it's designed to be made without grains. This was my 1st opportunity to use my coconut flour. I thought it was the ingredient that made the dish. It just had such a nice texture & taste. I added cayenne, as suggested by another, but didn't taste much difference. I think users could experiment with spices they think goes with coconut. My son also enjoyed the dish.",
