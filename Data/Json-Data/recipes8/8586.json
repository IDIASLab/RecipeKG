I was surprized how great it turned out...I used chicken with bones (backs & legs) and skin and omitted the ghee. Would probably be healthier, tastier and nicer to eat if I had boneless chicken thighs. This is one of my new favorites even though I used the wrong kind of chicken. Yum!\n\nJust an FYI/edit - Since I adore this recipe so much I made it again the next week but had no cilantro...it wasn't nearly as good! I'm not a huge fan of cilantro but it is really essential!",

I also microwave cooked some frozen green beans and added them at the end and served it over rice. one good thing is my husband loved it and he generally dislikes chicken curry.",
