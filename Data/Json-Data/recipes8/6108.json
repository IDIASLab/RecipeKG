Made this cake, but didn't have a jelly roll pan or any sour cream. SO...I used a large glass baking pan (approx. 10x15x2) and susbstituted 1/2 cup of vanilla yogurt plus one egg yolk for the sour cream. I also used butter instead of margarine. Cooked it for about 25 to 30 minutes, until toothpick in the center came out clean. I was afraid to spread the frosting on the hot cake but it was very easy and didn't rip the cake.  This was BEYOND a hit with 4 teenagers, and the adults raved about how the icing \"melting\" into the top of the cake made it incredibly moist. Definitely a keeper for my chocolate craving dessert nights!",
