This soup has really rich flavor, but the negative in not browning the meat is that you can\u2019t drain off the fat.  Cincinnati Chili (also known as Skyline) is made this way, and boiling the meat really breaks it down, changing the texture.  I did not find this soup greasy, but if the fat issue bothers you, you always could refrigerate and then scoop it off.  Easy enough to make, I like the fresh veggies in it, and it was enjoyed with half a BLT double decker sandwich.",
