I love the fact that this ice cream is naturally infused with mint - to smell it was heavenly; I'll definitely use that technique for future mint ice creams. And because I believe chocolate makes everything better I added in some mini morsels toward the end. Next time I'll use full-sized chips. Yum. Don't do like I did and use half and half in order to save a few calories; it was a little icy. Next time I'll definitely go with the full on cream. Also I think I overfilled my machine. The next day when I was making the leftover mix that batch was much creamier.",
