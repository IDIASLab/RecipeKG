Meat, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, onions, green pepper, salt and pepper.\n\nI followed this recipe to a tee, except I needed an extra tablespoon of oil to saut\u00e9 the onions and garlic, and I added a bit of sliced bell pepper\n\nThis recipe was really, really good.  Early on, I feared that the thyme and oregano had completely taken over the recipe, but as it cooked (I did 8 hours)it really mellowed out.  It is delicious, and the gravy/sauce is a little thick, which works well with noodles, rice, or potatoes.  I served it over potatoes and boy was it good.\n\nThanks :)",
