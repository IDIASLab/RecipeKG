Shawarma usually involves a stack of meat on a grill, but this recipe calls for a layer of chicken thighs on a sheet pan, in the oven. Use the broiler briefly, at the end of the baking time, to achieve extra flavor from the light char. Chicken can be served on steamed white rice, or sliced and served in a pita or flatbread with tomatoes, lettuce, and your favorite tzatziki or tahini sauce.",

I liked the addition of the red pepper as it gave a nice subtle hint of heat\u2014not too spicy at all, mild and worked perfectly. The onions underneath the chicken were delicious as well. I made the recipe as written and think that next time I\u2019ll cut the cinnamon amount by half, add more turmeric, and maybe little more coriander. The cinnamon was good, but was coming through flavor wise a little more than I would have liked. Those are just personal taste preferences though. I\u2019m glad I tried making this recipe as I had no idea how easy it is to make chicken shawarma and this recipe was darn delicious overall. Served this with yellow rice, falafel, salad, and extra tahini and hot sauce I had on hand from a local Middle Eastern restaurant. Great job Bibi and thanks for the recipe!",
