If you are using dried make sure it is good quality thyme or you will end up with it leaving a bitter taste in your mouth! If you don't like thyme just leave it out or try marjoram or savory instead....the cumin in it gives it that something extra.... I originally got this recipe from a friend who lives in the Greek Islands...For some reason the recipe only says 1/4 cup olive oil, I use 1/2 a cup or even amounts of oil to lemon and vinegar (my friend just uses lemon juice in the original recipe no vinegar, she uses 2 cups of olive oil to 1 cup of fresh lemon juice)",
