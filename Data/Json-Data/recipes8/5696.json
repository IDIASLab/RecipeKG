It has a festive bouquet of colors and flavors: red peppers and tomatoes; white potatoes; black olives; orange carrots; yellow pineapple chunks; beef-stew meat; and mini cocktail sausages. I added a lot of pepper and the full tablespoon of optional hot sauce and it still wasn't especially spicy relative to the spicy food we typically eat at our home. I am guessing that maybe the natural sweetness of the pineapple juice cuts any spiciness but I really don't know. In any case we quite enjoyed it. Thank you Moaa for sharing your recipe.",
