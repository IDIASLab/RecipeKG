I thought it was a little spicy so the second time I used a little less than half and it was great. I like my tofu crispy too so I tend to cook it for about 20 mins. I also doubled the marinade (the tofu is crazy absorbent after freezing it) and sauce and added in some stir fry veggies and served with rice :)",
