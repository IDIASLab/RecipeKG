Part decadence, part simplicity, and could be the main feature of a romantic night at home or a fun meal while watching the game.  I followed the recipe to the letter except I steamed a California mix of veggie (steamer bag in microwave). This needs a veggie! Since the recipe calls for cooked shrimp, I used an Air Fryer shrimp recipe from this site. Find/use a good lemon pepper or spicy shrimp to jazz your potato up. Why 4 stars then? Because the sauce, while really good needs\u2026.a little bit more favor. Maybe some garlic or onion powder while saut\u00e9ing the garlic. Maybe a little cayenne? Paprika? Overall, love this and will make again - with some minor tweaks. Thanks Bibi!! A keeper!!!!",
