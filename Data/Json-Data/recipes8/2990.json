I roasted 4 green chillies & 2 Jalape\u00f1os (instead of using cans) then I put them in a plastic bag so that the steam would soften them up. Once they cooled, I peeled each one, cut the ends off, opened them up, rinsed them so that there would be no seeds, then chopped into small pieces. Did everything else to the \"T\" & it was AMAZING!!!!",

                "reviewBody": "I had a few problems with this recipe. The taste is good but there is no where near enough chicken mixture for 2 layers in the baking dish. I added a whole can of corn and black beans too so I even had more than I should have. Ultimately there's no reason to bother with layering them tho because the tortillas are all just mush by the time it's all heated through. The large can of enchilada sauce is way to much too. I threw about half of it out. I will try another version of this tho because like I said the taste is good. The chicken mixture is delicious and would be really good as a normal enchilada filling. I think I might also try it with just some tortillas on top and none at the bottom or in the middle because there's just no point in them. Oh and less sauce it was way to saucy.",
