We used Jerk Seasoning on the outside (on request of my husband.) and used this stuffing on the inside. I couldn't find Ground lamb for the life of me so we used ground beef instead. I'm didnt rate it when I made it because of the two changes were a bit drastic. However its 10 months later and out of nowhere my husband requested the same turkey this year for thanksgiving. He looked hopeful and very excited. He enjoyed it enough to suggest we bring it to the 'big family event' to share with others. so it was \"Out of the blue remember and still love' good. I am not a stuffing fan. Infact usually i avoid it at all costs. I enjoyed this stuffing very much. And also look forward to trying it again. looks like we have one of our first family traditions beginning with this recipe. Thank you.",
