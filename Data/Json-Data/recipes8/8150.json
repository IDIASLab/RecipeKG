Perhaps it was my preparation method. I followed the recipe as written although I had to omit mustard powder because I didn't have any. I lightly coated boneless chicken breasts in olive oil and then rubbed generously with this spice mixture. It sat in the fridge for a few hours before I baked it. The chicken was fairly moist and the spices were pretty good but it really felt like it needed something to help it along. I really think this could be greatly improved by doing a yogurt marinade with these spices or making some kind of tomato-based sauce to go over it. I still have some of this spice mixture left over I may try one or both of these ideas to see how it turns out. I would also reduce the turmeric by about half as it is not my favorite flavor.",

I had to substitute a few things I didn't have in my pantry (no garlic or onion powder so seasoning salt and no extra salt. no dry mustard so I ground up some mustard seeds). I thought it was going to be REALLY strong from the ingredients and the smell so I didn't put it on super thick. Next time I'll be putting it on extra thick because it was surprisingly not as strong as I wanted! I also added an extra tablespoon of curry powder because this mostly smelled of cumin and I wanted it to be more curry.",
