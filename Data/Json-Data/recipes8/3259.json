                "reviewBody": "This was a great receipe for my first time making fish tacos, I only made a half a pound; so I cut the receipe in half, really only some of the seasonings. The cumin I actually cut in half and then cut in half again and substituted its other half with new mexico chili powder it came out flavorful. This was for the slaw and for the fish, which I made shrimp and fish (cod - two frozen costco peices) and it came out so well. The salt was a bit much for the fish, I put two tsp. which I should have only put in one tsp., but was okay with the other seasoning measurements I puts in. I put one tsp. of black pepper, one tsp. of New Mexico chili, and 1/2 tsp. of cumin; but I didnt change the lime measurments, when I marinated the cod fish and the shrimp (12 pieces).  Watch the shrimp if you cook at same time as fish they cook a minute or two faster; if they look like a letter C then they are done, and pull off the grill or pan. It can be a family or friend affair with all the cutting and mixing. Enjoy.",
