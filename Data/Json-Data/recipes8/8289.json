This was good on a bun with some ketchup (honest!) but it's also good without the bun.  Want it extra quick and easy?  Use a bag of Johnsonville pre-cooked brats, thawed, but throw them in still cold.  Works wonderfully.  My whole family liked this, even my 18-month old.  This deserves 5 stars simply because it tastes good but it's so fast and easy.  After making this a few times, I realized a regular size can of saurkraut is plenty, at least for our tastes.",

                "reviewBody": "Very good recipe but an excellent variation on this is: 1. Always precook the brats in straight beer with onions chopped up into large pieces in beer. Boil the onions in beer until soft prior to boiling brats. Only boil brats for 5 minutes then take off heat and let it soak in all the beer and onion flavor for a while. 2. Take several jalapenos and center celery stalks and chop to small 1/4\" pieces and sautee them in butter over a low heat until very soft. Keep pan covered. I use 50/50 mixture but if you like it hotter go 66/33 or if not so hot go 25/75(first number is percentage of jalapeno in mix) 3. Take a flavor injector syringe and inject the jalapeno and celery into the brat. Be sure to only inject the mixture into the ends of the brat not through the sides because the the juice will leak out during the cooking with the sauerkraut. 4. Put brats in the sauerkraut and cook til done. 5. Use the onions in the beer on your sandwich. 6. Enjoy",

I added the sauerkraut to the onion then the bacon plus caraway seeds. (German people need these seeds in their kraut) After simmering for about fifteen minutes I then proceeded with the recipe. I used Johnsonville Brats even though my Dad Otto would probably laugh at me. Sorry Dad but they're good. Anyway this is a good and comforting dish and I thank you for submitting it.",

He actually ate it and commented that it 'tasted pretty good' HA! I could not bring myself to buy the pale anemic uncooked bratwurst so I started with the precooked kind and skipped step 1. I did rinse and then simmer my kraut in a pan with a bit of water and beer for about 15 min. and then put a generous amount of brown sugar on top after putting it in the baking dish (my attempt at disguising it for hubby dear). There were no leftovers my 7yo ate up the extra brats hubby claimed the beans and I got the kraut...everyone was happy!",
