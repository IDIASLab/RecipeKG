I did not have parsley so I just garnished the sandwich with cilantro and chives. I had never seasoned a grilled cheese sandwich and now that I have I really don't think it is needed. I sprinkled the cheese with the oregano and I know I won't be doing that ever again. Spreading the softened butter on the bread produces a much more even browning than melting the butter in a skillet. It was worth a try but I'll just stick to traditional grilled cheese sandwiches, bread and cheese.",
