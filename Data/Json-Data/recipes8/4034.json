I cooked mine in 2 loaf pans and omitted the cream cheese filling in this one but will be making a lot of pumpkin cream cheese rolls with this recipe. I did make some changes because I did not have items on hand. I substituted the butter for coconut oil used coconut milk and also added an envelope of xanthin gum which I do with all my gf baked goods that contain grain based flour. The batter was even incredible. As soon as it came out of the oven it was soft on the inside and rather dense when I cut into it. I did have some hot with cool whip on it. Now that it has cooled properly the texture is perfect and I highly recommend this to anyone. I used brown rice flour and tapioca flour because that was what I had on hand.",

It wasn't quite done so next time I'd put it in for longer. Everyone tried it and I had several comments that people really liked it and if it had been done a bit more it would have been perfect. My husband said he liked it just the way it was because it was very moist. I'm giving it 5 stars because it would've been perfect if it had been baked a bit longer and because you couldn't tell that it was gluten free.",
