I cubed the chicken and tossed with the cinnamon and cooked for less time about 15 min. I used a half of a jalapeno a whole garlic clove i added cayenne to the potatoes before going in the oven the whole lime a bell pepper with the onions olive oil in stead of canola and lots of cilantro right near the end. the potatoes needed a little non-stick as well but otherwise different and really a nice meal.",

My husband said it was one of the best dinners I've ever made.... and we've been together 12 years so that's a lot of dinners! I served it with some NO FAT sour cream which was a good call because it would have been too dry without being able to dip it into some cream but that said it was way yummy and i'll def make it again.

We are pretty picky but we definitely did enjoy these - but we expected a little more of a kick. Next time we will add a little cayenne to the potatoes before baking to give them a little more spice. Also I think that coating just the outside of the chicken with the cinnamon mixture didn't really allow the cinnamon to stand out as much. Next time I think we will cut chicken breasts into slices or cubes toss in spice mixture and then cook (so cinnamon covers more surface area). Also the jalapeno didn't add anything and we even used ALL the seeds! Next time we'll add in at the end so that kick is not lost in the cooking. We'll also use 2 limes to enhance the lime flavor. It needs a little help to be 5-stars but this is overall a great combination of flavors!",
