The filling stayed inside the tortillas while being fried, due to the way it was cooked. I didn't have tomatoes, so I added green pepper instead. The flavor was amazing, I'll be adding this to the rotation and playing around with adding things to the filling. At some point, I will try avocado, cilantro, cheese, and/or beans in this recipe.",
