I do not have a self cleaning oven, but with some accommodations this recipe works wonderfully in my non self cleaning oven.

I also preheat the oven to the lowest setting available (200\u00b0F instead of 170\u00b0F) for half an hour. I appreciate the oven before are you start heating the milk, and that the temperature in the oven even out and cool down a little bit while the milk heats up.",

The only thing I need to do is add a little more sweetening as I ran out of honey before putting in jars.   It is thick and creamy and no sour taste.  Last week my husband and I stayed at a B&B in Kentucky as a gift for our 50th weeding anniversary from our daughter.  For breakfast they served Summer Parfait with summer berries, homemade honey vanilla yogurt and homemade granola.  I was hooked.  So good!  So much better than store bought.  Don't be afraid to make it.  I put hot water in my cooler while my milk cooled then after putting my jars in and putting in the water I wrapped a beach towel around it and also put inside an insulated bag.  Still warm when I took it out 8 hrs later.",
