I was hesitant to use barbecue sauce as I felt teriyaki sauce would go better with the  pineapple.  I brush the barbecue sauce over the entire kabob looking for that sticky taste.   The flavor was good and I will make these again but I will use teriyaki sauce.  Thank you csiebe for sharing your recipe!",

THIS IS THE NEW DISCOVERY: Took a packet of chicken gravy and instead of mixing with a cup of water ... used a 1/2 cup of (leftover) pineapple juice and 1/2 cup of chicken broth. OK, and maybe a splash of Chardonnay. Absolutely outstanding. Will do this at the beginning from now on. Believe I will try this kabob recipe with smoked sausage next.",
