I used broth instead of bouillon and black beans instead of chicken substitute.  It was absolutely wonderful-so healthy and easy too!  Thanks-I'll definitely be making this regularly!  Note:  If you want a brothy soup with pieces of tortilla in it, don't add your tortillas until just before serving, even just directly into the bowl and pour the soup on top & stir.  If you cook it too long with the tortillas in, they will break apart and thicken the soup.  It's great both ways-we LOVED it!",

The first time I made it I was nervous because we had friends from Mexico over and they said it was the best tortilla soup they had had since they left! I have only used red enchilada sauce because I always prefer red to green. I have made this vegetarian substituting vegetable broth for buillion and dropping the chicken substitute and I have made it non-vegetarian with boiled and shredded chicken instead of the chicken substitute and using chicken broth instead of buillion. I like it both ways! I typically double the beans and corn and it is great with black beans instead of pinto for a slightly prettier appearance.",
