I found both beef and pork chorizo in my local store and opted for the pork (I guess that's the more \"traditional\" kind). It was a 12 oz. package so I eyeballed roughly 2/3rds of the package when making this recipe. This was kind of messy to make. One complaint though. I thought this recipe called for too many tortillas since they were not very \"loaded\". I used 1-1/2 8 oz. packages or 18 tortillas and I think 12 tortillas (8 oz.) would have been plenty or maybe even fewer would suffice. I agree with previous commenters that maybe the corn oil isn't needed and that the ratio of chorizo to cheese is too high.",
