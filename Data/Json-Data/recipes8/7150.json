Be patient with your roller as the dough will appear to be tough but worth the roll out time.  I rolled out the dough a cup or so at a time. The extra flour on the noodles will thicken the broth. I cooked the noodles half way before dropping the chicken back in for the last 10 mins.  The only additions I made was chopped onion, garlic, carrots, bay leaf for depth.  Family loved it!",

I liked that the noodles weren't completely uniform were clearly homemade and were more rustic. They puff up a lot when cooked so I would err on the side of cutting them pretty thin vs the recommended size or bigger. I also thought the noodles were even way better the next day after they sat overnight in the broth. Texture was incredible. Pillowy but still a bit firm. These are too simple for excuses.",
