I think I may have added too much flour because it seemed to be burning on the bottom of the dutch oven. I added wine earlier to deglaze the pan and to not have burnt tasting stew. After taking it out of the oven and before adding the potatoes and carrots, I had to add quite a bit of beef broth. It ended up turning out very good. Thanks for the recipe!",
