These are exactly as the submitter describes \"crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.\" One word of caution is that they do spread quite a bit. They will puff up while baking and then flatten out pretty thin so make sure you space them apart accordingly. I used a small cookie scoop and my first pan I placed them too close together and they all ran into each other. If using a half sheet pan only go 3 across the width and no more than 4 lengthwise. They are very tasty and go perfect with a cup of tea.",
