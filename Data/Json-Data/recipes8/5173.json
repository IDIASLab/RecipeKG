I didn't frost the outside with cream cheese; when I spread the fillings betweeh the layers, I spread nearly to the edge, then pressed the top layer down to squeeze the filling out to the edge. After the last layer, I trimmed the sides, cut the loaf in half, wrapped each half tightly in plastic wrap and placed it in the freezer for about four hours, which made slicing it thinly MUCH easier. I cut it into thin slices and served it arranged on a platter; I think frosting the outside with cream cheese would have made for a messy presentation. This was time-consuming but worth it. ",

I cut it in wedges  and wrapped each wedge unfrosted to be packed into school lunches for something different.
