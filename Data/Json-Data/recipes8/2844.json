I had to remake it myself to find out what he'd been raving about. I've made a few adjustments and so can you according to your tastes! This is a great casserole to make because some of the canned ingredients you may already have. Serve with sour cream, hot sauce, and cold diced tomatoes or salsa if you like. Maybe even serve some chips and guacamole to round it out.",

It tasted fine I would make it again if I were in need of a quick meal but I just found it okay. I wouldn't go out of my way and plan on making it. I found that it didn't come together at all when you put it on your plate it just falls apart it's just a bunch of cubed chicken and beans there is really no need to put it in the oven you could skip the tortillas (they're awkward as a crust anyways) melt the cheese on top of the stove and then maybe wrap it all in flour tortillas. That would be better I think. I would not make it to drop off at someone's house it's just not that good; but it is an okay quick meal.",

I actually passed it on to my mexican friend who loves enchiladas but has a 2 year old and no time for prep these days. It was so easy and it tasted fabulous just like an enchilada minus the time investment. I love the idea below of substituting the tortillas for chips that would make it perfecto! It is definitely not a meal that you want to make if you're looking for something that looks pretty. I did it in a casserole dish cut it in to squares w/a pizza cutter and served. It did fall apart but I wasn't looking to impress with presentation so that was okay. I stored the rest for lunch all week and everyone at work kept asking what smelled so good. The other thing that I love is that it is packed with nutrient dense ingredients that have lots of fiber whole products and protein. It's a perfect and healthy (if you go light on the cheese) family meal. I give it an a",

The best thing for this recipe is to make sure you have all of your ingredients chopped up and ready to cook. Otherwise you might burn the meat if you re off chopping more veggies. I also substituted the chicken with ground beef. And it was still great. One of the things I might changed about this is instead of having full corn tortilla on the bottom of the pan I would make it have chips. Just because when I cooked it it was hard to cut as well eat. My family just ended up scraping off the tortilla and just using chips instead. Something to think about before you cook it. The taste was GREAT. And I m a picky eater so to say that it really means something. Try it! You ll never want to lose this fabulous recipe.",

I made only one change to the original recipe - after reading the reviews I decided to use the crunchy tostada shells (like a flat crispy taco shell) broken into 2 or 3 pieces and laid on the bottom of the pan instead of regular corn tortillas. This came out to a nice crumbly corn crust for the casserole and I can see how regular corn tortillas could probably be mushier and harder to cut if used. i will definitely use the tostadas again the next time b/c i really liked the flavor it added. Otherwise I thought this was a great recipe as is. I served it with a dollop of sour cream salsa and some diced avocados on top and spanish rice as a side. Easy great thing to have in the frig for leftovers something to leave for the babysitter etc. I made it for a friend who just had a baby and they really liked it too it's a comfort food type of dish. I also like that is uses mostly whole ingredients not a bunch of processed stuff!",
