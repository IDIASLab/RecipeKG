I live in Florida so we pretty much can grill out all year. But when it gets as hot as it is now it s no fun standing out by a grill so I really liked that this was done in the oven (used my toaster oven) in 20 minutes. Honestly grilling may have been better and that may be an option when it cools down but for now the oven worked great. This chicken was absolutely delicious tender moist good selection of herbs bright flavor from the lemon juice simply wouldn t change a thing! Thanks for sharing your recipe we thoroughly enjoyed it",

This chicken was outstanding! Did as one reviewer suggested, increased the spices to suit our tastes. And I grilled the chicken breasts whole instead of cubing the meat. About 5 to 6 minutes a side on the grill until it reached 160 degrees then I covered it in foil to allow it to finish cooking to the recommended 165 to 167 for chicken. We also marinated the vegetables separately and then roasted them in the oven. Topped with a small amount of tomato basil feta cheese and it was amazing!! Thank you for posting this recipe!",

This recipe was very easy to assemble as it followed the directions to a tee. \nWe were very impressed with the tenderness of the chicken.
