Was determined to make this for my husband and I, as  we are doing a \u201ctime off\u201d from carbs to see if it gives us more energy (though love carbs- def going back).\nSwapped a few items cause I didn\u2019t have on hand. Replaced 1 banana w 1/2 c applesauce; lemon juice (fresh) for the apple cider vinegar and avocado oil instead of coconut oil. \nMixed the eggs together until smooth and continued that idea every time I added the wet ingredients. One at a time and mixed it until it was very smooth. Slightly sifted the almond flour and mixed all dry very well. Then poured in slowly to wet mixture. I usually make regular banana bread and have to say the consistency was very close. Had no issues w clumps or dryness. In fact it was very moist before and after. Did bake at 325 for one hour then 300 for 15 minutes. The flavor is wonderful -sweet but not very sweet. Can see adding vanilla yogurt on top...oh which I did add chocolate chunks shaved on top. Presentation wise looks great. Very happy- thank you all who gave their thoughts- it really helped w this recipe!",

I'm not celiac, so I substituted 1/2 cup of the almond flour for 1/3 cup Vital Wheat Gluten and 1/4 cup flaxseed meal to bump the protein & omega-3 and give a somewhat fluffier texture. Added a scoop of vanilla whey protein powder as well, used egg substitute rather than whole eggs, and used Nosalt for half the salt. Finally, made this in 12 muffin tins, with 8 chocolate chips each in 6 of the banana-almond muffins. Result has 18.6g fat, 12g protein, 22g carbs, 4.7g fiber, 12.5g sugar & 287 satisfying calories per muffin, by my count.  And it's SOOOO banana-yummy!",
