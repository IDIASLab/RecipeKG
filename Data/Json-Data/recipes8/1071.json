I Googled for a substitution and found orzo, which I had on hand, so that\u2019s what I used.  The shrimp in my freezer were jumbo, so I cut them into large chunks.  Had fresh dill in the fridge, so I used triple the amount specified for the dry dill, and that flavor was vibrant.  This really is a very upscale, fresh-tasting, but somewhat mellow pasta salad with lovely presentation. I live in Florida, it\u2019s already in the 90\u2019s today, and I foresee this salad on many summer menus this year.   Thanks for sharing your recipe soggy tomato, we really enjoyed it.",
