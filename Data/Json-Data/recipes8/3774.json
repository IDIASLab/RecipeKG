I however did want something that was thrown together the night before, so I made it up to the point of adding the flour and stuck it in the fridge until morning.  Then I added the flour, gave it a quick mix with the electric beater and popped it in the oven.  4 adults were very happy with it.  I do have one thing to comment on...I haved the recipe and in doing so, the cooking time was also cut.  It took less than 45 min to cook.  Just a heads up in case anyone else cuts it back!  Great egg bake and am so pleased to not to have it include bread in the recipe!",

My recipe includes a teaspoon of baking powder, which makes it puff up nicely.  As written this recipe is five star, but here are some other things you can do.  If you want to speed up the baking process, put it in a preheated 400 degree oven for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down to 350 for another 20-25 minutes.  I sometimes add spinach and mushrooms instead of diced chilies.  I usually use just 8 oz. of reduced fat sharp cheddar to cut down on fat and calories, and I use eggbeaters instead of whole eggs. You can substitute olive oil for the butter, too.  It keeps pretty well for a few days, but is best when it's fresh out of the oven.",

I prepared the recipe exactly as presented with the exception I added 1/2 cup of chopped onions and 1 cup of small cut broccoli florets. Another version I tried, instead of chopped onions I used chopped water chestnuts... All versions so far are 5 star in my book. Even with the smaller serving recipe I still baked 1 hour @ 350\u00b0 and the texture and taste were excellent... I topped servings with salsa, your choice mild, medium, hot. Then all I had to do was eat, sit back and enjoy the compliments.... -Jornie1",
