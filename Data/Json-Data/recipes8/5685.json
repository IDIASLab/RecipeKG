Did not have Thai chile pepper, used a few drop of hot sauce.  Recipe calls for minced onion, carrots and celery I cut into small chunks.  I omitted the peas (family dislike) and potatoes.  Served with a side of polenta.  This reminded me of veal stew my Italian grandmother and mother served.  Absolutely delicious.",
