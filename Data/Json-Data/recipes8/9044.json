Maybe due to the stuffing, there was a LOT of juice in the pan I used, so I had to empty it halfway through, and there was still more by the time it was done. I was a little worried that it had boiled the meat, but it turned out all right, if a little on the dry side - I probably should only have roasted it for 5 or 5 and a half hours. I skimmed the oil off the turkey juice and used some of it to make sauce with, refrigerating the rest for later sauce (sauce tastes best when you make it fresh). Yum!",
