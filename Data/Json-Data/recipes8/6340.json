We marinated and grilled not only chicken, but pork, salmon, zucchini and yellow squash.  Everything was absolutely yummy in every way.  The addition of the tzatziki sauce was like the icing on the cake.  We made a slight change of the addition of a touch of fresh mint in the tzatziki, and it was amazing.  I'm a person who likes to know why you do what you do in recipes sometimes.  My husband informed me that letting the tzatziki sauce chill for at least an hour after making helps the vinegar in the sauce break down the other ingredients so that they can combine.  I'm glad to know this, because I will never rush a tzatziki again.  The sauce was so simple and delicious, as was the marinate.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!!",

I made a few minor changes in the Tzatziki sauce.  I used a good Greek yogurt but wanted it extra thick so I strained it through a coffee filter.  After grating the cucumber I put it in a strainer with a hefty pinch of salt and let the water come out.  I then put it on paper towels and squeezed out any remaining liquid.  Instead of vinegar I used fresh lemon juice as the acid. I added 1/2 teaspoonful of dill weed and a small amount of fresh mint.  I believe Tzatziki sauce would be good on a flip-flop.  Thanks, Bakermom.  This is a fantastic recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "4 stars for the marinade. Followed the marinade recipe exactly, and the chicken was good, but next time I will probably increase the lemon juice and oregano for our tastes.  We would have liked a little more intense lemon and oregano flavor, so increasing those two things and maybe adding some lemon zest along with the juice would do the trick, but as written was still very enjoyable.  Tzatziki sauce as written not so good, so only 3 stars. A little bland tasting with a strange mouth feel. So, I did take some reviewers advice and altered it slightly by using lemon juice in place of white vinegar, a pinch or two of both dried dill weed and sugar, and an extra tbsp of olive oil to give it a more creamy consistency. Lastly, after grating the cucumber, spread it on several sheets of paper towel, lightly salt and let sit for about 15 mins to allow all the moisture to be drawn out of the cucumber.  Then dry thoroughly with more paper towels before adding to tzatziki. Doing this will prevent your tzatziki sauce from becoming overly watery. I've tried making tzatziki several times and with the adjustments this was my best attempt by far.  I think the pinch of sugar to cut the bitterness of the yogurt and the additional olive oil to give it a better mouth feel were key. Thanks to the original poster of the recipe and all the other cooks out there who wrote reviews and added suggestions.  I love this site!",

I also let it marinade over night so the lemon juice has time to do its job and the flavors really penetrate. For the sauce, I would add a step, after grating the seeded cucumber wrap in a paper towel and give it a good squeeze to draw out the extra moisture. If not it will leach into the yogurt making it a watery mess. I also prefer lemon juice to white vinegar but i saw where someone recommended malt vinegar, i may give that a try. And most importantly you need to add a good teaspoon of dried dill weed or mint. I prefer dill. Finally warm a pita or any middle eastern/ indian flat bread by brushing it very lightly with good olive oil and placing it on flat griddle or heavy skillet for a few seconds and servce with a big greek salad with lots of tomatos, cucumbers, black olives, feta cheese etc. and you have a summer barbeque feast sure to make you forget about hambergers and hot dogs with chips.",
