I tried to smash the middle with a fork and most just busted open so mine weren\u2019t very attractive. I accidentally put parsley on before baking so I just threw more on at the end. They came out seriously overcooked. Seeing 40 minutes cook time and 70 minutes bake time on small red potatoes definitely seemed like too long but the middles were edible and the flavor was nice. I would definitely be willing to try this recipe again boiling or microwaving the potatoes first then baking for a much shorter time frame. This could have worked had it not called for small red potatoes but red potatoes instead because they are larger in size therefore need longer to cook.",
