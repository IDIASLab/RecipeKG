I took a quart of ice cream and put it in disposable cups which I froze for hours cut the cup away inserted sticks cut the ice cream into bars then froze it again. I let the chocolate mixture cool for up to 30 min before coating the ice cream so the heat wouldn't melt the ice cream and the shell became solid within a minute and it's thick enough when it's cool to where only one coating is needed. Freeze again after dipping. Soooo good!",
