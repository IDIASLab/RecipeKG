I did not add the chili powder and garlic to the mix as it was well seasoned as it was. I added a cup of rice as well. After it was baked we added hot sauce to taste to each individual serving.

As a casserole it fails. Add the chili seasoning to taste otherwise it will be too spicy. Overall we liked the flavor BUT the tortillas added nothing. This is a pretty ugly dish and would never dream of making it again or serving it to anyone.",
