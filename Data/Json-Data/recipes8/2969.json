I switch the honey and lime juice...use a 1/3 cup fresh lime juice and about 1/4 c. honey and I use 18 tortillas, 6 for each layer.  It just seems to cover better.  I also get a 28oz can of the green enchilada sauce and use just a smidge more of the cream and green sauce to coat the top.  I have used different variations of cheese, from cojack to Monterey jack and even sharp cheddar and extra sharp white cheddar.  It ALL tastes Great!  This is becoming one of my families favorite recipe!",
