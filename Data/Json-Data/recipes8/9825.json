Although I made it as a rustic tart, (I used the 2nd pie crust earlier in the week on a chicken pot pie) the only other change that I made was that I used a 10oz bag of frozen freestone peaches; and I would make sure that I thaw them, when I make it again; as the peaches were still a little \u201cal dente \u201c when the crust was done.  Otherwise a perfect peach dessert! ( the pie was so wonderful smelling while cooking that we ate it straight from the oven & I forgot to get an after photo!",
