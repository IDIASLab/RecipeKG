It is extremely moist once the rum glaze is added, which is also extremely sweet. Once I cut into the cake and put a slice on a plate, the slice just crumbled into pieces. I tried 3 times to cut a slice and all 3 times it just fell apart into pieces. I couldn't even bring myself to share this with anyone....it went down the garbage disposal.",
