I followed it exactly except I didn\u2019t have fresh nutmeg.  And since the recipe doesn\u2019t say what to do with the onions, added them to the pork while browning. To me it needed\u2026..something. Perhaps more nutmeg and red pepper flakes? Maybe fresh basil? Half Italian- half spicy pork? Not exactly sure and not sure if I will make again.  Glad I tried something new!",
