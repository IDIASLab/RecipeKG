I also added some diced green bell peppers and onion. I wanted to use a 9X13 pan so I doubled the recipe (and added 2 extra eggs because I was concerned it wasn't \"wet\" enough). I threw this together Saturday afternoon and baked for an hour Sunday morning. This will be a repeater at the LTH house. THANKS for the recipe!",
