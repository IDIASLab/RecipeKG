I made the non-vegan version (used butter and chicken broth instead of coconut oil and veggie broth), and it ended up being very good.  One difference between this soup and the one my friend made is that she added a little turmeric to hers, which I will try the next time I make the soup - it adds a little extra kick.  I recommend topping the soup with flax seeds and pine nuts for a satisfying crunch!  It's also nice to serve it with some kind of bread for soaking up every last delicious drop.  Thanks for this great recipe!",

It seemed like the perfect way to use up the leftover pumpkin and coconut milk I had from two other recipes.  But it was full-fat coconut milk, and perhaps that was my problem.  It was too rich, so even though the flavour was good, there was an overpowering fattiness-- so much so I could hardly finish my small bowl.  My recommendation-- do not use full-fat coconut milk!  ",
