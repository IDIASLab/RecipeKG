I noticed the others had a little arrow root, almond flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. They really need some type of flour consistency like substance. This also had an additional egg than other recipes I viewed. I thought it tasted like banana eggs. The ingredients do not transform themselves. I did add a small pinch of salt and cinnamon. I also used a little safflower oil, not being a fan of coconut oil tastewise to cook food. I am sure these would be fine to simeone that has had flour and grains out of their diet for sometime. Be careful, as they go from raw to near burnt in seconds. Cooking between a 3-5 is best.",
