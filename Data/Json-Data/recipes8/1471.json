I removed them to a plate covered with foil and did a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce so they sat for several more minutes continuing to cook. Was hoping for about 145\u00ba\u00baF but bottomline I overcooked them. With all of the ingredients I was expecting more flavor and although this was OK it simply didn t have a whole lot of flavor. Sorry for the less than favorable first review but this was a bit of a disappointment; not bad but not outstanding either. I doubt I ll make it again but I don t want to discourage others from trying just didn t work for us.",
