Watch out because they go down WAY too easily and are stronger than you think. You may actually want to weaken them a bit because of this. Definitely rim the glasses with the salt/sugar mixture. It adds depth and dimension to this drink. I do NOT as a rule enjoy fruity drinks but because this is made with real watermelon juice it's not sickly sweet. In addition you can add lime juice watermelon juice and a little soda over ice in a rimmed glass for people who don't want the alcohol. I served it both ways and it was well worth the trouble of juicing a watermelon.",

My husband is not a watermelon fan so he didn't care for it but the other two guys (who had been munching watermelon slices) LOVED it. I had to practically beg them to take a break from their beer to try a fruity drink but then I was asked to make more. I can't get enough watermelon so I thought it was delicious. I followed proportions exactly except a bit less simple syrup and I thought it was a good balance of flavors. It has a delicious watermelon flavor without being overpoweringly sweet (but I did halve the simple syrup since the schnapps and fruit is already quite sweet) or too strong tasting. It's also an attractive festive summery drink. Be warned though it's so yummy and refreshing and goes down so smoothly that it'll sneak up on you!",

I omitted the salt and only used the sugar on the rim (just sounded odd to me). I added a splash more vodka because I like it stronger. It made 4 martinis for me. (YES I said me!) Very good!",
