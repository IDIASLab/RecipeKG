I only used 1 package (2lb) of boneless thighs (bone-in works fine though!) and 1.5 sweet potatoes, and the tops were burning and black beans dried out because it was not covered in liquid.  So, I doubled the cumin, allspice, garlic, 1.5C salsa (light, med, hot doesn't matter), and 2/3C broth.  Use a slotted spoon if you don't want soupy, but this really wasn't!  Used box of uncle ben's chicken wild rice (with the seasoning) to serve on top of, and people go ga-ga over all the flavor.  This definitely makes the house smell warm.  We \"HATE\" sweet potatoes, so my husband cringed when I told him what this was made of, yet this is now both of our favorite meals.  I'm so glad I trusted the reviews.  Also added a can of corn, and glad I did as it was the perfect mix of flavors!",

Another change was using a can of jalapinto beans instead of black beans since my husband doesn't care for black beans and I added a can of MexiCorn. When I stirred it after I got home from work, the chicken shredded itself so it was like a thick chicken stew. I served it over brown rice. I will definitely be making it again.",
