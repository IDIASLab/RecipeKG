I did not add red cabbage. I also added two seeded and chopped jalape\u00f1o peppers. I bought buns that were split on top and some people put the slaw inside the bun and the hotdog on top for easier eating. I used a fork and knife. This was a fantastic summer meal. I served with cut up cantaloupe and grapes and potato chips.",
