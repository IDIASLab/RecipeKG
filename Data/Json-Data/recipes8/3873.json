Will add more fresh garlic next time but otherwise it was fantastic!",

I didn\u2019t measure or follow the cooking times or technique exactly.  I didn\u2019t add garlic powder or Italian seasoning. Garlic, salt and pepper were enough.  I didn\u2019t EVEN cook the chicken an additional 20 minutes after already browning it a couple of minutes per side. (Now that would have been some tough, dry chicken!)  And I certainly didn\u2019t include the brine from the capers or the \u201creserved artichoke liquid\u201d (which I obviously didn\u2019t reserve in the first place).   The broth, a splash of white wine and a good squeeze of fresh lemon was all this needed. Once the sauce has been reduced, just a few minutes, lower the heat and swirl in a little butter for a smooth, velvety sauce.  Garnish with fresh minced parsley and thinly sliced lemon.  I served this with pasta with garlic and oil, and Swiss chard.  My kind of meal -  Hubs\u2019 too!  Following the recipe using the indicated caper brine, artichoke liquid and cooking the chicken an additional 20 minutes, I\u2019d call this a generous 3 star recipe.  However, given that this is such 5-star quality ignoring those instructions I\u2019ll call it at 4-stars rather than risk scaring others away from this excellent dish.",

I did tweak it a little; used two breasts, but kept the other ingredients the same as called for in the recipe as I served it over angel hair pasta & wanted lots of sauce.  The changes I made were adding 3 cloves of garlic (we love it!), used artichoke bottoms instead of hearts (not fiberous), substituted sun dried tomatoes for the capers & added 1/4 C each of chopped fresh parsley & cream at the end.  After plating, I grated fresh parmesan reggiano on top.  We both loved it!",

I cut the chicken thinly rather than pounding, then salt and pepper it on both sides and lay flat on a plate. Sprinkle on crushed garlic and zest and juice of one lemon. I let it sit for 10-15 minutes, then flour (I haven't been adding the Italian seasoning) and then continue as written.The marinade adds a whole additional depth of flavor. I've also found that different brands of artichoke hearts and capers taste differently in this dish, so you may have to experiment with amounts. I add flour slurry at the end to thicken.

I have never had restaurant chicken picatta served over pasta, so maybe my frame of reference is off.  That having been said, it was still pretty good with the following tweaks:  I used three big garlic cloves and I did need to sprinkle about  a tablespoon of the dredging mix to get the sauce to thicken.  If I were to make it again, I would use half an onion and grate it, as one reviewer suggested.  I would also cut the liquid ingredients by at least half.  Or, I'm thinking I'll try the other Chicken Picatta recipe on this site, minus the giant bed of pasta.",
