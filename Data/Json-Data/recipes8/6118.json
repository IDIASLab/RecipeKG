Second, I took the suggestion of adding 1/4 cup crushed honey graham crackers and some vanilla to the peanut butter mixture. Adding a little bit of butter to the chocolate was also a helpful idea. The finished product was absolutely delicious.",

They are now in the freezer...where they will stay for a while.  The thinner the chocolate shell, the better.  Oh, and I also used them without liners.  I just sprayed the muffin pan with oil and they popped right out after being in the freezer for a bit.  No oily residue or taste either.",

It may seem time consuming because the recipe says it takes two hours..but that's just waiting for them to harden (which if you put them in the freezer doesn't take as long as you think).  These are better than the regular Reese's(R) peanut butter cups!! So yummy and so much cheaper to make yourself!! Even my husband, who is candy and cookie making challenged made these!

                "reviewBody": "I found it easier to pick up paper cups in my hand & pull melted choc. onto the sides with a spoon this way.  It looked like too much choc., but I figured it had to be somewhat thick to hold the PB in.  Once the cups were filled, I'd used 1/2 bag of chips,as called for & was perfectly divided. Put in freezer for 20 min. Filled w/ creamy PB. I was unsure here b/c the PB mix was thick & seemed to be \"heaping\" out of the cup when I used all of it.  How was I going to cover it w/ choc & make them appear flat like the real thing?  But it turned out fine as the PB melted a little on its own & smoothed out nicely as it set at room temp. Then I stuck in fridge to keep cool while I melted rest of chips.  I evenly divided melted choc. among all 12 cups.(about 1 tsp. each)Do not try to keep muffin pan clean while you drag choc. to edges!  It's too time consuming trying to do that:)  It makes no difference in the end.  I put in freezer, then fridge & finally to counter.  But I think if they sit in fridge for a little while to set up,that is all that's needed.  They can be eaten almost immed. Tasted wonderful-kids said too much PB, I thought if anything, too much choc on bottom.  But overall, definitely hit the spot!  Fix these up in a short box, line with tissue paper, foil, etc. & fill with a  half dozen or so cups.  They look just like the real thing.  They taste rich, but so are the real ones. Mmmm! Thanks for something original, yet creative to make with the kids.  Will make again!!",
