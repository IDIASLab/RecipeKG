I made some slight modifications because of what I had available: I used a fresh habanero instead of a dried one and I used grated Romano instead of grated Parmesan. One word of caution to anyone who's going to cook this. I recommend wearing rubber gloves when handling the habanero and when you're cooking it make sure you have plenty of ventilation in the kitchen. I almost went into a coughing spasm when I was browning the veggies due to the capsaicin that gets released in the air when the habanero is cooked and it feels like someone started a fire under my finger nails. Just be careful. It's a delicious dish and well worth the peril.",
