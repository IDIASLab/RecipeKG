It was good but pretty soggy and lacked kick Next I added fresh lime juice which really perked it up. Then I tried it with Mission tortilla strips instead of fresh tortillas - OK and not as soggy. Also did it with pre-fab pico de gallo to which I added the tomatillos. Pretty good. And substituted cheddar for the plain Jack - much better than using 2 kinds of Jack as written. Actually it was very tasty any way I made it but always came out soggy. Probably can't fix that though. Because of the sog factor I rate it 3.5 stars rounded up to 4.",
