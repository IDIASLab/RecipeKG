        "description": "This is a great holiday cookie because you can make a giant batch of dough and bake the cookies all at once or keep logs in the freezer and bake them when company is expected. One of my fondest food memories is making butterscotch-walnut cookies with my mom from a terrific recipe of my great-grandmother Jeanne Hirsch, who grew up in South Carolina. Jeanne, I was told, would roll the dough into long logs and wrap them in waxed paper for chilling before baking-something I still do. Bake as many cookies as you need and wrap the leftover logs in plastic wrap, then place them in a resealable freezer bag to bake another time.",
