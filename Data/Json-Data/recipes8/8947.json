I washed the brine off pretty thoroughly after marinating a good 2-3 minutes and let it drip dry after patting off excess water. I also more than doubled the butter and you can mix in any non salt flavoring into butter you might want. I added in crushed fresh garlic and ground coriander seeds and parsley to complement the marinade. Amazing!",
