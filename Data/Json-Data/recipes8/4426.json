Above and beyond producing something that's visually impressive, we are also flavoring our pork chops from the inside out with this method. So, this is basically a technique video and will work no matter what stuffing you decide to use--although this peach stuffing was absolutely delicious.",

Followed the recipe exactly, except I couldn\u2019t find double cut pork that was boneless, but still turned out great with the bone! I saw in another recipe video that the bone prevents the chop from searing as well as boneless, but it turned out fine. I love watching Chef John\u2019s videos, and trying his recipes. Definitely makes me look and feel more confident as a home chef! Please keep them coming, Chef!",

The cook time was nearly spot on at 15 minutes. The meat was tender and juicy. The filling was sweet, savory, and had a hint of heat/spice. I tasted the completed sauce from the pan and I was concerned it was going to overpower the plate and I was clueless about how to \"season it to taste\". I left it as it was and served it, fingers crossed.  It was perfect. My mother in law is a retired professional cook.  My husband said I made the best pork chops that he has ever eaten in his life. My kids, ages 6 to 22, are difficult customers. Not only did they all eat dinner without prodding or complaint (once they got started), they cleaned their plates!!! \nThank you, Chef John!",
