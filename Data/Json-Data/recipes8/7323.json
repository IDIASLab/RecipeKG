                "reviewBody": "OMG - these are SO good! I am on Weight Watchers and it is not that hard to pare it down in calories and fat. I followed the recipe exact except for using the smaller lower fat tortillas and just sprinkling the cheese on each one. I used bacon pieces and they are only 35 calories per tbsp. I don't make my mashed potatoes that fattening so that helps also. I served with tomato soup so that you don't have to keep eating them to get satisfied (kind of like eating tomato soup and grilled cheese). To cook I used my Cusinart Griddler with the flat plates on 400 degrees so it only took 2 minutes to cook total (because I didn't have to flip). With my own tortilla I used butter flavored spray rather than real butter and I also didn't add any cheese to mine. It still tasted really good and definitely reminicent of perogies. Tips: you will be tempted to pile on the potatoes but use a little restraint - the potatoes will seep out if using a grill press like I did. It doesn't affect the taste just looks a little messy and may run over onto your griddle. Also heat up your mashed potatoes first for easier mixing. THANKS a million for this awesome recipe this has to be the BEST way to use up leftover mashed potatoes!",

It does indeed taste like perogies and even more so once they cool. The only change I made to the recipe was reduce the amount of cheese by about half. It could have used slightly more cheese but not 2 cups. Anyway we really liked this dish but probably won't make it very often because the the fat and calories in it.",

Great idea!  I left out the bacon and green onions because we're not bacon fans and didn't have any green onions on hand. I cooked quesadillas in a dry skillet over medium heat with no butter.  They came out perfectly toasted without adding the extra calories from butter.  I used a the Mexican style blend of four cheeses but think they would be even better with pepper jack, will try that next time!  For the dipping sauce I mixed 1/2 cup sour cream with 2-3 T. salsa.  Thanks for the great recipe MrsB!",

And all the steps were really really simple. The flavor was great from what my kids tell me. Son didn't like the onions but oh well. My other 3 children gobbled them up. The only part I found was it was hard to spread the potatoes on the tortillas. I think I would do what I do with refried beans for the next go around because I will make them again is put the potatoes in a ziploc baggie snip the corner and pipe them out on the tortilla for easy coverage. But all in all very simple recipe. Get way to use leftover mashed taters.",

My leftovers were the bulk of insides from baking red potatoes for tater'skins....so there was no milk or butter in them just the potato I mixed that with a tsp of ready made bacon crumbles and chopped chives...spread it out on a 6 inch LOW-FAT tortilla and quickly fried it without oil butter or cooking spray you get a nice crunchie texture on the tortilla and hardly any fat! I served with salsa....I am definitely going to be making these on a regular basis! Thanks MrsB for a great idea!",
