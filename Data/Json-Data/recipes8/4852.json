I sauteed the mushroom ingredients on low, because when cooking with pure butter it burns easily, so I wanted to be careful.  I added a splash of white wine, and I slowly cooked the mushrooms for about 45 mins.  I also didn't feel like roasting the garlic (it was too hot out), so I added minced garlic to the mushrooms.  Next time I'll try it with roast garlic, but it was still fantastic.  VERY gourmet, and perfect for a classy event, or wine tasting.",

I really want to give it one star but that would give it a very low star rating and deter other people from trying it out on there own. Maybe it was me...but I don't think so.

This recipe has the potential for endless variations of different nuts and mushrooms all delicious! A word about mushrooms: 1-wipe clean with a paper towel to remove any debris. 2-discard the stem it is \"tougher\" than the cap and may produce a gritty texture in the finished product. 3-initially cook on med-high heat with butter and oil (adding oil increases the smoke point and keeps the butter from burning) to caramelize the mushrooms (just like caramelized onions they taste better). Then lower the heat and add non-salted flavored liquid (wine sherry etc) and water as necessary to tenderize and finish cooking. I would also like to clarify the amount of walnuts I believe it is 1 cup of whole walnuts not chopped or diced so adjust accordingly and use a smaller amount of chopped or diced. Take care not to burn the walnuts!",
