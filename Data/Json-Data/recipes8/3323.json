I could not find cilantro and omitted and used pepper jack cheese instead of Monterey Jack (due to Covid-19).  Taste-wise they were okay, no complaints.  Ingredient-wise, using what was listed I had enough to make 20 flautas with Spinach and 1 cup of Black Beans leftover (note-I measured the cheese directly from the bag so do not know how much I used).  If I were to make these again I'd cook the filling first, this would make it easier to get a good roll for the flautas.",
