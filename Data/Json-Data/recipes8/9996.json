        "description": "Summer is a time to simply take it easy, and that's so much of what I love about this buttery blondie recipe. Not only does it capitalize on one of the most iconically refreshing summer flavor romances of all (lemon + blueberry forever), but it couldn't be simpler to whip up at a moment's notice. You may very well have every ingredient called for in your kitchen right now, and all you need is 25 hands-on minutes to pull these scrumptious lemon-blueberry bars together. P.S. If you happen to be a real citrus fanatic, consider doubling the glaze recipe for a more generous drizzle.",
