It can also be made without the crab (I have a few friends who are allergic) and is just as good. I found it's delish served with slices of multigrain baguette. I tried this version and found it to be a bit bland. The version I usually make calls for green onion instead of regular, has no celery, uses real crab meat (the cheap canned stuff is fine), has a tablespoon of lemon juice and Old Bay seasoning and/or hot sauce to taste. I also found that using Campbell\u2019s cream of mushroom with garlic is a phenomenal addition. Trust me it's to die for! Probably best for special occasions only though with all the fat/calories. For Halloween I usually add a few drops of red food coloring for a pinkish hue and put it in a brain mold.",

Also substituted onion for 1/2 cup green onion and 1/2 cup sweet pickles finely minced.I'll keep this recipe as a basic, because its pretty good.",

I put it in a ring mold and it came out perfect! I did put some cooking spray oil in the mold which helped unmold it. Some olives or celery in the center and crackers around the edge and everyone ooo'd and ahh'd! Then gobbled it all up. Be sure to use little spread knives to put it on the crackers. I did add a little real canned crab to the imitation and it gave it a stronger crab flavor without increasing the cost too much. I am for sure going to make it again.",
