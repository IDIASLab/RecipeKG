I think this dish has a lot of potential in fact everything went really well right up until the avocado was added. All of the flavors work very well together until the avocado changes the texture of the salad and then it's just not good at all. I think the previous reviewer's garlic suggestion is a good one. In the future I would definitely leave out the avocado- with a few changes this would be great over chicken with chips or even spooned over the top of sliced avocado. As is it unfortunately wasn't good.",
