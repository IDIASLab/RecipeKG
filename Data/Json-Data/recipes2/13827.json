I have created many wonderful recipes and I don't use artificial sweeteners so they taste great but they don't always look very decadent. I made some sugar free cinnamon buns adapting one of the recipes from this website and topped it with this icing which was infact quite good. It made these cinnamon buns look just like the originals and for once they had a sinful looking sugar free dessert. Thank you.",
