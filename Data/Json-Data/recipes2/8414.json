It really doesn't need it and they get lost. The other thing is to lose the oil in your breadcrumb mixture too. I'm assuming that step is so that you're breadcrumb mixture will brown however that bit of oil makes it difficult for the breadcrumb mix to stick to the chicken. The buttermilk marinade is the perfect amount of moisture to get the breadcrumb mix to stick so all you really need to do is spray your coated chicken with some non-stick spray to get that browning affect. This was excellent, I was impressed, and this is one I will make again!",

Was really good, tasted like Shake and Bake with more crunch.  The meat was tender and juicy, marinated overnight.  I had no problem pressing the coating on, was easy. I didn't have a rack but turned out fine; thighs only needed 25 minutes baking.  Too much poultry seasoning though.  Will make again with bone in thighs, less poultry seasoning and more BBQ sauce in the marinade.  Thanks for the recipe, made a great meal.",
