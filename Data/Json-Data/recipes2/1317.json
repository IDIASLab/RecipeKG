I did not want to cook the beef in oil so I skewered the seasoned meat and cooked them directly on the grill. Costco had some prime grade sirloin and it was perfect for this. Blue cheese sauce was delish too. Yummy! Thanks for sharing!",

I hate the smell of fried foods in our home so we elected to grill these outside. The sauce came together in no time but I'd probably nuke it in short intervals next time (and I used 1% milk rather than opening a can of evaporated). THANKS for the recipe!",

On accident I added a whole tsp. Of chili powder and my boyfriend threw in a few red pepper flakes so it was pretty spicy for my mild tastes but I'm so glad we did because it made it come alive without burning my mouth. I put it on the steaks as they came off the grill. It definitely thickens into a paste as it cools. I can't imagine it being saucy enough to be able to use it as a dip. But as a steak topper It will be hard to ever eat another steak without it!",
