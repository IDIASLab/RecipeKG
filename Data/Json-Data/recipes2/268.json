I made a small amount of this recipe, using the buttery tasting Yukon Golds, and baked it in a small, oval ramekin.",

This is what I did because I was determined to make this and try to be fair in my rating. I used golden potatoes because they are my husband's favorite. Skipped bacon because I can't have it but I am sure it would take it over the top. I did everything else the same except I used a quality plane flavored sharp cheddar cheese and for the salt I used garlic salt. I hate the mess of making mash potatoes but it is so rewarding in the end. I am freezing half of the uncooked potatoes in small containers for several meals as it is just my husband and I. Enjoy!",
