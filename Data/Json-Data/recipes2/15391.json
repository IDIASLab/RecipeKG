Cold just sounds nasty. In addition I used low-fat cream cheese and instead of duck sauce my friends and I all liked it with hot chile sauce (sambal olek or some other Thai-style hot red sauce). I also added some thinly sliced scallions or green onions for a little extra zip and crunch. I get requests for 'my' recipe all the time.",
