He said it was good as a Stroganoff and S.O.S, this from a man who thinks biscuits and gravy are gourmet :) I did halve the amount of cream cheese after other reviewers comments, and they are right. Overall most recipes here do not impress me, but this one was a hit and there was enough leftovers so I dont have to cook when it is 111 degrees here(Phoenix). Good Job!",

Here's what I changed:  8 oz. of med. egg noodles; 1.5 lbs. lean gr. beef - brown the gr. beef and add in the gravy mix plus 3 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, fresh ground black pepper to taste and 1 cup of minced yellow onion. Cook that for a couple of minutes and then add 4 oz. (instead of 8 oz) of cream cheese and stir on low heat until incorporated.  Then follow the directions exactly except use 1.5 cans of the cr of mushroom soup.  Hopes this helps others. I like the way that this recipe mixes the ingredients together. Thanks! ",
