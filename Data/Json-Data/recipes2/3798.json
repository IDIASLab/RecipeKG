In my case we used zucchini onions garlic tomatoes jalapeno pepper and basil. I used regular bacon so I cut the amount of spread to fry the vegetables. Toasting the burritos in the ICBINB gives them a great flavor and texture I love the crispiness of the tortilla. I'm definitely making burritos following this recipe again.",

To build the burrito I added a bit of sour cream across the tortilla then the egg then a bit of le gruyere cheese shredded. Oh and the best part of this was I heated the tortilla up FIRST with the spread then when it was warm and pliable added all ingredients and rolled up. AWESOME recipe and one we will make over and over and overrrr....:)",
