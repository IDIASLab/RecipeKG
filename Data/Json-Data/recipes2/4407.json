So fluffy and yummy i filled them with a cream cheese/cinnamon filling and used regular buttercream frosting with 1tbsp of cocoa yummmmm GREAT cupcakes.. The batter was soooo fluffy and creamy I thought I did something wrong but they turned out wonderful! I have to add though that many people weren't into the strong cinnamon flavor so if making for many people I suggest less cinnamon.. That's why I took one star a lot of people weren't into them at the party I took them to.... But I loved them & will make again for my son and me!",
