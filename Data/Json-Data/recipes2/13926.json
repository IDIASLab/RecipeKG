Next time I plan to double the receipe so that there are leftovers because the first time we made it there were none. I might try adding cooked cubed chicken and since our family loves bell peppers I might add a few more of those too! Overall it was delicious and easy to make. The hardest part is chopping up the veggies. Thank you Becca for sharing this great easy and fast supper idea!!",
