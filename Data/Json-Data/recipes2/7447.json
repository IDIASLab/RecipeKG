If you use grey mustard instead of yellow remember that it's pretty strong and add quite a bit less mustard. We didn't have any problem with the quantity of sauce but I used more chicken (cooking for 4 hungry people:) and served it over some Thai red rice. I wouldn't recommend serving this to someone who doesn't have adventuresome tastes; It's a bit \"sp\u00e9cial \" but very tasty! Thanks! I also used fresh basil for the marinade but didn't notice the flavor when it was done.",
