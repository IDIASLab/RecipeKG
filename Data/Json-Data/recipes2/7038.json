I did cut the spice down to half to satisfy my guests however, I plan to make it for myself as written. For the compote, I used frozen fruit. For the cream, I used 1 tsp of vanilla extract in place of the beans, added 1 tsp of fresh lemon juice and I will most likely use maple syrup in place of the honey because it didn\u2019t want to blend. I garnished with a sprinkle of homemade granola. This could easily be used as a jam and would be a wonderful topping for ice cream or granola or anything. Thanks for sharing!",

Always have way more rhubarb than it calls for so I triple it and freeze the extra compote for later. I reserve about 4 cups for finishing up. I\u2019ve used it as the recipe calls for and also for a pie. Just used a pecan crust - I cooked the 4 cups of compote with a little tapioca pearls/flour to thicken it. Let it cool in the fridge before putting it in the crust then make the topping and spread it on. Stick it back in the fridge until ready to eat it.  My husband loves it says the flavors are so good. I did add a pinch of cloves once and used fresh ginger a couple times.",
