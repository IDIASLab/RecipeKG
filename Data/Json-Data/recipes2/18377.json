I think we will use that sauce on other things too.  We put some mozzerella cheese on top and it came out well.\r\n\r\nNext time, I'll make a couple of changes.  First, it was a little too saucy.  We ate it with fork and knife, although the sauce was very good.  Maybe I should have gotten a large pizza crust instead of the medium.  Also, we will bake this directly on the rack instead of using a pizza stone so the middle gets crispier.\r\n\r\nNote - We used Biboli pizza crust.",

I used Mama Mary's Pizza crust (walmart) 2 in a pkg. - held up perfect for this style pizza!!  I make 2 batches since I have the extra crust.  Rubbed the crust with the olive oil. Omitted the butter.  Used 3/4 c. Classico reg. alfredo. 3 crushed cloves garlic.  2 Roma tomatoes seeded and diced.  Only seasoned the chicken breast with pepper when cooking.  3 Tbls. shredded parmasan cheese. Kept the remaining ingredients the same.  Baked at 425 degrees for at least 20 min. on preheated stone.  Can bake longer.  Sauce has never come out runny.  I slice with pizza cutter after it comes out of oven.  Have used mozzerella instead of feta.   Have used tomato basil feta and cut the dried basil and oregano in half.  But have always found that it needs to bake at least 20 minutes or more.  Thanks for a nice change in Pizza.  Family always enjoys it!!",

I cut up one raw chicken breast in small pieces and then cooked it on top of the stove in the marinade from Chicken Diablo from this site (we had leftover from the previous evening). I also had about 4 slices of leftover bacon to cook and I cut that up small and cooked on top of the stove. Instead of pesto I had this sun dried tomato brushetta in a jar that has a lot of nice flavor to it. I made the sauce as it said more or less then layered in this order: sauce chicken cheese bacon. I think a little mozz. like half and half would have been good. All the feta was a little heavy for me. Very tasty.",
