I ate this as is with a dollop of reduced fat sour cream but the boys ate this like tacos in either hard taco shells or flour tortillas.

Also I did use the garlic powder per the recipe and I normally use actual garilic. I probably would have given it a 3 but speed and ease of preparation made it worth 4. Also the fact that it didn't have any \"unusual\" ingredients just items I already had on hand. Makes this a weeknight chili rather than a weekend chili and that's just what you need sometimes. Having said all this I would try it again with a few changes. Thanks!",
