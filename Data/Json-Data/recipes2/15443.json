Also, I use 1 1/4 cup coconut since the nuts and chocolate chips make it so rich.  If I have milk chocolate chips laying around, I'll do half milk chocolate and half semisweet.\r\nAlso - don't skimp on the condensed milk - I tried making them a couple times with \"generic\" condensed milk and they were terrible.  Pay the extra dollar for Eagle/Borden/Carnation.\r\nPerfect for get-togethers - everyone asks what's in them after their eyes roll in a flutter.",

Haven't had this before have now made it 3 times in a fortnight my co-workers love it. Made it as per recipe the first time (minus pecans nut allergy) - fantastic! The second time I subbed dark chocolate for the semisweet and chopped glace cherries and Craisins for pecans and the third time I subbed white choc for the semisweet and glace cherries instead of pecans and added an extra half a tin of milk. I wanted a recipe that was easy to make from items I'd have on hand and this is it. Thank you very much for sharing!",
