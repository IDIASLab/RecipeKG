Just a few suggestions to make sure these are perfect everytime: 1. buy the largest mushrooms you can find, most grocery stores sell ones labeled for stuffing, they are much easier to work with 2.prior to stuffing bake the caps, upside-down, in the oven for 10-15 minutes, this help the caps shed excess water so the stuffing doesn't become waterlogged.  Thanks Dinah for such great mushrooms!",

I bought one of those big bread crumb cans from the fryer isle pre-seasoned with Italian spices. I did dry the mushrooms a bit in the oven 10 minutes by themselves at 350 degrees. I figured with all the wet-works I added it might be wise. Man I was not prepared for how wonderful it tasted. So much flavor. I took what I could not eat, and that was plenty, to work the next day and I could not keep the cover closed. I pawned off 30 mushroom caps. They would take one mushroom and go back to their cube\u2026 wait five minutes and they would come back and take 3 or 4. Score.\nThe next day with the ton of stuffing left, I baked pre-spooned stuffing balls on a baking sheet for 15 minutes. Then I cored out to make caps using those small cherry tomatoes. Put the half cooked stuffing into the tomato caps. Added a little piece of mozzarella cheese on top, and then I baked them for the remaining 15 minutes. The key is not to turn the tomatoes completely into mush. \nI plan on coring squash and cucumbers boats next time. I will let you know. It should be awesome. Truth is I think I would eat this stuffing if you fed it to me stuffed in a rock. Speaking of which, make sure you thoroughly clean your mushrooms. I had one that had some grit. It is easy to miss with all the hiding places for dirt in a mushroom. That would be embarrassing at work or a party.: )",

People are still complimenting me on these mushrooms. They were so easy to make and the stuffing would be great with other vegetables too like tomatoes or peppers or even to stuff a chicken breast for seafood. I made the stuffing a day a head and refrigerated it overnight which really gave the flavors a chance to mix. But if you do this since the butter hardens the mixture you'll need to set it out for about 30 minutes or so before you stuff the mushrooms or microwave it for a few minutes on no more than 30% power. AWESOME recipe!!",

Take the butter way down-use 1/3 of the amount called for, and use it in the stuffing-don't drizzle any on top at the end 4.  I used all clams 5.

I only used about 1/3 the butter and I still thought my arteries were going to burst. I used the juice from the clams like suggested. However the taste of the Italian Seasoning is WAAAAAY overwhelming. You could easily use half. Lemon Juice squeezed on top does help a bit but man cut down on the Italian Seasoning! I would not make this again without some adjustments.",
