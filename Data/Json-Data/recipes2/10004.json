I didn't add the topping cause I didn't feel like a pretzel topping. I also added a cup or two extra of broth and adjusted the seasoning to match. I wanted this a little more like a soup or a stew and I ate it with a slice of sourdough toast. Honestly one of the best recipes off this site. YUM!",

Some of the substitutions I had to make: canned mushrooms prepared minced garlic dried thyme canned chicken broth almond milk instead of heavy cream not-yellow but not whole-grain mustard Mexican shredded cheese and potato chips instead of pretzels (I did forego the butter because of all the grease in the chips). There was a little bit of adjustment in the cooking times to get the consistencies called out in the recipe but this was trivial and may not have been necessary. Can't wait to actually try this with the actual called-for ingredients.",
