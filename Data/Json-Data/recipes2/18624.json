Mixing soy sauce and cornstarch doesn't work to coat the pork instead marinate the pork in 1/2 cup soy sauce,  then just dredge in 1/2 cup cornstarch or enough to coat all the meat lightly and fry in enough hot oil to get a nice crisp coating, turn in pan to fry evenly - No water added. Remove the cooked meat, or move to side of wok or large skillet and add oil to the pan and cook the veggies, (I like to parboil the carrots just to soften a little, drain and add to fry pan - then add pineapple and sauce. You can make your own sauce by mixing the following: The reserved pineapple juice, 1/3 c. sugar 1/3 c. ketchup and 1/3 c. white or cider vinegar, 4 Tb soy sauce and 1 Tb cornstarch - only add a little water if needed.Hint: Sharp kitchen shears work great for cutting pork loin meat into small cubes or strips!",

The carrots were not cooked after the 10 minutes they simmered with the pork so I had to add about another 10 minutes so they weren't crunchy. I thought they were sliced thinly enough but maybe not. And then the green peppers lost all of their color and ended up overcooked (onions were fine). In the future I will saut\u00e9 the peppers set them aside and then add at the end along with the pineapple just to warm up. The presentation would be much nicer as well because the green peppers would remain bright green. But all in all the pork was very tender and we liked this. And it was easy to put together.",
