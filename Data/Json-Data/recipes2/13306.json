The pie was simple to make. I made the dulce and a couple days later I put together the pie. After tasting the whipped cream I added a couple tablespoons of sugar. I chilled the pie for several hours before serving but the banana layer turned into a \"soupy mess\". I have since read that banoffee has a tendency to do that. . While a mess the taste was okay and my family gave it mixed reviews.",
