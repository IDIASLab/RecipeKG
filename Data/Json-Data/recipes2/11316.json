It ended up being almost fudge line in consistency. I topped the ice cream with chopped up Heath bar candy and then drizzled with hot fudge and a little whipped cream for each slice. This time I made it slightly different. Instead of the chocolate chips, I used peanut butter chips and topped the ice cream with chopped Reese's peanut butter cups. Can't wait to try it!",
