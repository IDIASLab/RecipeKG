So the recipe should actually call for 1 pkg., not 1/2 pkg if there is supposed to be enough filling for two rolls. (Good thing I tried this out before my party, as I had already committed the other sheet of pastry to a baked Brie!)\r\n\r\nBecause of the concerns about greasiness mentioned in a previous review, I baked my pinwheels on a cookie rack placed on my baking tray so they might drain a little during baking, which seemed to help.  They definitely benefit from draining on paper towels after baking, and also from the ginger apricot dipping sauce I made to with them.\r\n\r\nAnd 300 degrees for 20 minutes?  No way - try 375 for 25 minutes instead.  (The recipes that came w/ the puff pastry all called for 375-400, anyway.)\r\n\r\nThese pinwheels came out about 3 inches in diameter (quite a bit larger than \"appetizer bites\"), and that was starting with the longer edge when they were rolled up.  They would have been even larger had I started rolling at the short edge. The puff pastry in the center of the pinwheels was a bit soggy, too. Next time, I will cut the 8x12 down to 6x8.\r\n\r\n(It wouldn't hurt to reduce the amount of sausage to 12 oz. either, which is the most convenient size pkg. available.)",

I used 1lb sweet sausage and 1lb ground pork. I fried up onions & garlic first then added the pork after pulling the onion mix used the sage from another reviewer (thank you!) celery salt salt & pepper. After the pork was just about done added back the onion/garlic mix. I rolled out two of the pastry sheets and put a layer on both not thick but not thin. Rolled it up glued it together with some water and also pinched the ends too so it would stay moist. In the oven at 375 for about 35-45 min. Basically just till the pastry looked done. Everyone from 7-88 loved it and went for seconds. I'm totally making it again and I'll play with all the spices. A great quick & easy that you can really do anything with. Just cook the pork first. OH - the only thing I may add next time is an egg just to bind it together after it's cooked. It did fall apart a bit but that didn't distract from the great flavor.",
