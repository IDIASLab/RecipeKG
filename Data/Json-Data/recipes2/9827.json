I wanted more of the raspberry flavor though so I made indentations in each truffle and filled them with raspberry jam before dipping them in chocolate. Oh my goodness yum! But it does takes more chocolate to make sure they all get covered when you do it that way. I used Ghirardelli dark chocolate melting wafers rather than chocolate chips. It took about 15 ounces to coat all 36 truffles.",
