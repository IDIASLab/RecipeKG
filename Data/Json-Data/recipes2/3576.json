I pounded them lightly to make for equal thickness and an instant-read thermometer reached 180 degrees in about 3 minutes per side. I sweated the onion sliced very thin in the remaining butter for a couple minutes before adding anything else to the skillet. Made the onion a bit sweeter and a little easier to digest. For the mustard I used half Grey Poupon Country Style and half Mister Mustard an extra-pungent Dijon-style product. Next time I'll probably forego the Mister Mustard and use just a bit less mustard overall -- The mustard's piquancy was quite pronounced though pretty well balanced by the sweetness of the applesauce. Next time I think I'll also increase the amount of wine and cream to maybe 1/3 cup each. Reason: The sauce though very tasty became quite thick and really ceased to be \"saucy\". I'd like it somewhat thinner. The walnuts added a really nice crunchy texture. I wouldn't hesitate to make this for company!",
