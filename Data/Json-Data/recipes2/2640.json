Rather than let it go to waste I decided to try making a cheese soup with it and it worked great! I had used the mild Rotel tomatoes and that was plenty spicy for me since I also also browned up and added some spicy sausage to the dip. To make the soup I sauteed some onion added the leftover cheese dip and a can of evaporated milk. Once it started bubbling I threw in some frozen mixed veggies and thought it still needed a little thinning so added some chicken broth. Delish!",

During the early 1970's when my 3 sons were young they loved eating Rotel cheese dip w/Fritos. Now days when I have my weekly Maj Jongg game Rotel cheese dip is always on our snack menu. The microwave cooking time for my friends and I is usually 2 minutes then stir and heat another minute or 2 but never 5 straight minutes. If you microwaved the Rotel and cheese for 5 minutes you would end up w/a watery dip and I don't know anyone who likes watery dips.",
