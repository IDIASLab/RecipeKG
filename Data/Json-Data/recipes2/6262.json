I topped it with chopped chives for a little more color, and everyone loved it. Thanks so much for sharing!!!",

Surprising, since one would have thought that since I used a flavored, specialty orzo medley along with the onion, garlic and chicken broth, that wouldn't have been the case. Definitely needs a hint of seasoning of some sort. Still, a perfectly acceptable companion to a heartier, more robustly flavored main dish.",

Then, when I add the stock I also include about 1/2-3/4 c. of frozen peas. After everything has cooked and the rice has absorbed all the liquid, I gently stir in about 1/4-1/2 lb. of slivered toasted almonds (I always end up buying the almonds raw and dry toasting them myself).

Also I added a pinch of salt and some dried parsley at the end for a bit of color. It was really delicious and had a depth of flavor I was not expecting. It is extremely important to really brown the pasta though, I think a lot of people skip that part when making pilaf.",
