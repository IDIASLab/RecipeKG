This helps to bake it evenly and helps it to not crack on top. It is also important to allow it to cool inside the oven with the door only slightly cracked to prevent cooler air to rush in the oven. This also causes cracks in the cake.it is very easy and has a nice smooth creamy texture. The taste has a touch of sweet but not overly so. Enjoy !",

Then turned the oven off and cracked the door to allow it to cool slowly. It has no cracks and was fully cooked perfectly.  \n\nAlso another note - many reviews stated that it was too much filling for a 9\" pan - I believe they were using store-bought pie crusts as those pans are much smaller in volume than a SPRINGFORM 9\" pan. The filling amount was perfect for a springform pan.",

Because I'm just starting out (I'm 23), I don't have a lot of baking equipment  and I had to use a regular dish instead of a springform pan. Well, I'm assuming that's what caused the cheesecake to crack. It was just for me and my hubby, so appearance didn't matter so much! Also,  I feel like the filling should be split between two smaller cakes, because it overflows with just one. Other than appearance, the cake was delicious. :) Instead of a cherry topping, I made a blueberry syrup to pour over it. Yummm!",
