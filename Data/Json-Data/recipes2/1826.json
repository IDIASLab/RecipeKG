I took the suggestions under the cook s notes and added shrimp chicken and a few other veggies. I started by saut\u00e9ing andouille sausage which is my preference in Cajun recipes. Then I added the shrimp cooked until almost done and removed everything from the pan. Then I cooked the chicken in the same pan and removed. I added a tad more oil and saut\u00e9ed the veggies with the seasonings. I went with a true trinity: onions peppers and celery. I didn t have any marinara so I tossed in a couple of chopped fresh tomatoes. My jambalaya loving husband requested seconds! Quinoa might just be the new norm with this classic dish.",
