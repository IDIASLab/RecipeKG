When almost browned, add one envelope of dry onion soup mix and 1/4 cup water.  Once fully browned add 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheese.  Stir to melt.  This does help the mixture hold together as another reviewer stated.  Then spoon mixture into 24 crescent rolls without cutting them up.  Use three cans of rolls, 24 pickles, ect.  Fold in three corners, overlapping them.  Bake at 350 for 12 - 14 minutes.  My guys LOVED these!  The soup mix adds so much flavor and it was so much easier to assemble this way by adding the shredded cheese.  Hope this works for you, too!!!",

Use a whole roll. Keep them whole and use 3 cans of rolls.  I found that the original wau of cutting the trianlges in half made them too small to fold.\n\n2) I added the shredded chedder cheese into the ground beef as I browned it and before I put it into the rolls.  Made it easier to keep them in place.\n\nI have been instructed to bring these to a New Year's party we are going to because everybody requested them.",

In all fairness I followed other's suggestions and added a packet of onion soup mix to the ground beef and it made the beef really onion-y and too salty. I htink next time I will just use regular seeasoning. I also added shredded cheddar to the beef and that did help keep it together. I also used pickle slices and found it helpful to cut the sides off of them to make it easier to fold the sides up. I will definitely make again but keep tweaking it to get the flavor I'm looking for. Very easy to transport and still yummy cold. Thanks for the recipe!",
