For those who don't know chicken gumbo soup is typically put out by Campbell Soups and is condensed like tomato soup. Chilli sauce IS NOT canned chilli. It's a condiment like ketchup. You can either make it or buy it. Seriously folks. I live in the woods and I can find these ingredients! I think I'll make it soon and will most likely give it 5 stars.",
