I like to put the meat in a crockpot on lowest setting for 8-10 hours, but regardless of how you cook the meat, cook the beans separately.  Rinse beans and transfer to a medium sized pot.  Add water to about 2 inches above beans.  Put a lid on the pot.  Bring beans to a boil then remove from heat and let sit until about 2-3 hours before serving.  (Beans should sit for at least an hour.)  Continue to add enough water during soak period to keep beans covered.\n\nAt 2-3 hours before serving, add kosher salt to beans.  Bring beans to a boil and then reduce heat to low. Leave pot covered and let simmer for 1 to \u00bd hours until beans are tender.  Check occasionally and add hot water as needed to keep beans slightly covered with water.  Once tender, transfer beans to cooking meat mixture (mine are in a crockpot on lowest setting)  for at least a half hour to absorb the seasonings.",
