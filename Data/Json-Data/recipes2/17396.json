I wasn't sure that the recipe really meant for the apples to be unpeeled (keep the peel on) instead of peeled (take the peel off) so I asked The Woman I Love and we agreed that the apples should be peeled so that's what I did. I used Golden Delicious apples and they worked but perhaps Granny Smith or another more baking-appropriate apple would be better. Also I opted for red seedless grapes to add some color to the dish. We ate the whole thing in one night - it made two not-very-big bowlfuls for each of us. I'll give it a 4-star rating but The Woman I Love said she'd give it 5 stars and she asked me to make this for her once a month. Thanks for a great recipe!",
