It's true that some places in Eastern NC add sugar and some don't and some have additional spices added as well. One thing I have found is that this type of sauce seems best suited to the BBQ made in the same area most places already sauce their chopped BBQ before it reaches your table and it is blended in already and doesn't taste as harsh to some people than when adding it at the table. To get off the \"West Coast Twist\" and still have some sweetness just use granulated sugar. I use brown sugar and next time I'm adding molasses made in NC. It's also helpful to gently simmer the vinegar as you whisk in the ingredients so the salt and sugar dissolve better. It will stink a little in your kitchen (the simmering vinegar) but you will get a better result.",
