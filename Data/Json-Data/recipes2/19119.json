To make batter,put all vegies and meat and pour flour and add water and make batter and consistency is about not too watery not too thick like pancake batter..I usually eyeball it but you can start from 3table spoon of flour and 2 table spoon water etc.. but you need batter to the amount it can cover veggie and meat.Then,I use vegitable oil and just like you make pancake,you cook it flipping after one side done.Then, splash worcestersauce and cook some seconds and off to your plate.Mix ketchup and worcestersauce;ratio I think 4:6(I eyeball it,but to your taste is fine) and brush this over okonomiyaki and eat.Some people back home in japan drizzle mayo after you take okonomiyaki out to plate and drizzle worcester sauce and sprinkle crushed seaweed on it.You do not need okonomiyaki sauce or tonkatsu sauce.It still tastes good.Until you figure out water and flour ration to make batter is kind of practice but you will learn as you cook. I am sorry I could not provide measurement of batter but next time I make, I try to see how much I am pouring water and flour.",

If you cannot find the flour you can add a little seasoning salt to the flour to make it better. Though that is not exactly the same it will help the flavor of the batter significantly. Also a traditional topping for Okonomiyaki is flaked dried bonito and a sauce that is very much like tonkatsu sauce. Many also like to add cupi (Japanese Mayonase)... Replacing the chicken with cooked shrimp or cooked thinly sliced beef will make a few other good variations on the meal. Good Stuff!",

                "reviewBody": "I had to make a lot of substitutions because of the veg I did/didn't have. So the flavor of this exact recipe I can't really comment on. Our version used chicken napa carrots a regular onion garlic scapes and grated radish. The egg mix was as written. We pre-cooked the stronger flavored items to make sure they'd 'cook down' and my griddle was about 350 degrees for cooking. I would say this method is five stars because we're going to be able to take the method and use it for anything which is a complete godsend since we are members of two CSAs--one for veg one for meat. So we get tons of eggs and have no particular choice about what veg we get each week. This method will work for about anything we think and adding different spices will allow us to change this dish around completely--even to different 'ethnicities' if we want to. We made our own sauces--one mayo-based with wasabi and teriyaki and the other a thai peanut sauce. Both sauces did well with this recipe. With our substitutions I would say this pancake is sort of a 'base' for the sauce you choose. With stronger flavored veg and the traditional okonomiyaki flour maybe sauces would be more optional. I deeply appreciate this method it will work fantastically with even the weirdest veg we get from the CSA. Thank you!",
