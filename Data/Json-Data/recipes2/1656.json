I think if I were to attempt making these again, I would roll them in flour, then dip in an egg-wash and then roll in straight cornmeal. In my opinion, it was a waste of my panko crumbs.

In a ziploc baggie I mixed about 1 or 1.5 c almond meal a heavy dosage of creole seasoning dried onions salt and pepper. I nuked the frozen okra added it to the ziploc (without any butter spray or oils) then shook it all together. Poured it out onto a cookie sheet and baked at 375 for 20 minutes. It could have used the full 25 minutes but these were delicious AND gluten free! My husband dipped his in ranch. I will be buying another bag for those evenings that I need a quick easy appetizer!
