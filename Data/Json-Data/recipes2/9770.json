I used reduced fat cream cheese, fat free sweetened condensed milk, sugar free pudding mixes, reduced fat evaporated milk, reduced fat sour cream and \"light\" whipped topping. When I assembled the pie, I made a pie crust out of Nilla Wafers and butter, then a layer of sliced bananas and I spread the pudding mix over the top of the sliced bananas. Even with the lighter ingredients, this turned out fantastic! I'd like to play with this recipe and see if I can't make frozen pudding pops out of it. I bet that would be amazing. Quite happy with how this turned out. It was SO easy!",

Either way, it's a nice change from the norm. It was totally thick and fluffy. You really don't need to add extra whip topping when making the traditional layered banana pudding. I only added a little to the very top when I assembled. Other then that...it was something my kids will enjoy again. TY",

Instead I blended about 6 ripe medium bananas with about 8 ounces of evaporated milk. Because of this I only used 2 cups of cold milk. I also used two packages of vanilla pudding. Came out very delicious and rich.  It was easy to make with my 6 year old. The whole family loved it!",
