This was still so creamy & rich I could've further reduced or left out the butter and it would still be as tasty. Since we prefer a higher ratio of vegetable to fat I'll probably add more corn & green chile next time. To those contemplating whether to make this or not definitely do! I would try this with frozen or fresh corn & with Neufchatel a lower-in-fat cream cheese. These few changes won't compromise the delicious factor. --- UPDATE: I tried this again with only these changes to the recipe: I used Neufchatel cream cheese so the texture still was very creamy. I left out ALL the butter; I wouldn't suggest doing that as we did miss the rich extra-buttery taste. So if you want a lower in fat version do try Neufchatel & use only half the butter=perfect!",

I just sprinkled a little on top of my serving and that was fine but next time I think I'll try adding 1/4 tsp.
