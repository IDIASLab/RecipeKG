I generally prepare shrimp this way in a skillet on the stove top, but this was just too easy!  What was really kind of cool was that I used three shrimp apiece as an appetizer for our grilled steak dinner using small gratin dishes that looked so pretty on the serving plate along with the steaks!  For additional flavor and color I added chopped fresh chives from my garden and sprinkled the shrimp with paprika. I know I'll be repeating this as an easy and delicious appetizer regularly.",
