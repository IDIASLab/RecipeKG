Everyone asked for the recipe. i made a few alterations though... no italian bread crumbs? we just used plain bread crumbs and mixed 1/2 part italian seasoning. we also added a big pinch of salt and pepper. it totally brought out the flavor of the beef. And Instead of cooking it on the grill we just seared it on a pan grill to get the beautiful grill marks then finished cooking the burgers in the oven for about 5-8min it depends on your preferred doneness of the burger. instead of putting it on a bun we wrapped it in tortilla wrap with lettuce tomato slices and light mayo then put it on a hot dry pan to brown the tortilla and give it a nice crunch.:) awsome recipe! thanks a bunch.",

The only thing I can say is that these sound more like a Greek style burger not much of anything \"Italian\" in it except for the bread crumbs. Kalamata olives and the feta cheese are used more so in Greek dishes. Anyways this sounds really tasty and I'll have to give it a try soon.",
