I made to use with chicken tenders but decided to make into a spinach salad with tenders on the top and used the sauce as a dressing. Awww...it was so good. Used white corn and black beans as a side.

Truly a sweet-meets-heat item. The chipotle powder gives it a great smokiness and heat balanced by the sweetness of the honey. It took three days to use up the sauce and the heat definitely increased each day--which is great since I enjoy food with a kick. One of the best things about this is you can distinctly tell as a dressing this is fresh--the taste is absent the distinct flavor of preservatives and artificial components of commercially made dressings. Awesome. Super easy to make. 5 minutes tops and you have a natural and low-calorie dressing with great flavor...",
