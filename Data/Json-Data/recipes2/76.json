And the leftovers.....glorious when fried on both sides, then covered with spaghetti sauce, cheese, artichokes, roasted red peppers - whatever you have in your fridge.

Was fortunate to have stone-ground polenta meal from Napa Valley' s historic Bale Grist Mill. The fresh shaved cheese was great, but I did not have parm reggiano on hand. Used a blend of parm, asiago, and romano. Made a porcini tomato ragout to top it. Bellissimo.",
