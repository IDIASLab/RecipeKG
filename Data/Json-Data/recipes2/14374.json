If you enjoy stuffing you will like this. We like to saute the onions & carrots together until tender and then add stuffing.  We also steam or microwave the zucchini as it helps to retain it's flavor and this process doesn't have the watery affect boiling does.  We also drain the zucchini for a short period too.  Enjoy... This is a keeper!",

Next cook the onions with the squash, then the onion flavor won't be overpowering.  I also use cream of chicken soup (or cheese if you want it vegetarian).  Lastly, I think I use a little more stuffing, probably 8-12 oz.  Definetly try this one!",

It was a HUGE hit -- everyone kept telling me how wonderful it was...and her father-in-law went back for second & third helpings! I took some of the suggestions from the reviews I read. I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom, and layered Ritz cracker crumbs (about 24 crackers) on the bottom of the baking dish. I also substituted the sour cream for a package of softened cream cheese.  This recipe is definitely one that I'll use especially when I have to bring a covered dish to a pot-luck dinner.",
