Most people make this creamy by melting the cream cheese or dissolving it in the juice.  We actually add small chunks of the cheese after the mix has cooled.  So you have a clear gelatin with little white chunks in it.  So good!",

Top: We actually add small chunks of the cheese after the mix has cooled. Recipe instructions: Bring the cola mixture to a boil..... remove from heat THEN stir in pineapple cherries cream cheese... It doesn t say to cool the cola mixture before adding the cream cheese. So what happened was the cream cheese chunks started to melt but not completely and what you ended up with was a mixture that looked curdled for lack of a better explanation. And after more than 24 hours of refrigeration this salad still had not jelled completely had to scoop out of the dish with a spoon. IMO I would think you'd want to put the warm cola-jello mixture into the fridge for about 90 minutes or until it starts to thicken and then add all of your ingredients. The cream cheese wouldn't melt and your fruits would be evenly dispersed throughout the jello salad. Sorry this was a failure for me so I m just going to move on won t try again.",
