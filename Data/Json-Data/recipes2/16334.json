I'd suggest using at least two baking sheets. I made half a batch and had to divide it between two baking sheets to get it to bake evenly. If you want chunky granola don't stir during the last 40 minutes or so. This is great served with yogurt and berries.",

I microwaved the oil/honey mixture for 20 seconds instead of dirtying a saucepan and it mixed just fine into the dry ingredients. Then I baked on two parchment paper-lined sheets at 250 for about 2 hrs stirring every 30 mins. It smelled amazing! After taking it out I let it sit on the pans to harden up then broke it into chunks and added dried cranberries. Delicious great with Greek yogurt!",
