My local grocery stores carry sun-dried tomato pesto in the deli and in the pasta sauce aisle (Classico makes a good one) so check both places in case you have trouble locating it. My husband loved this I loved this and the friends I made it for also loved it--you really can't go wrong! Next time I'll use chicken instead of steak but this is a recipe I'll make many more times in the future. Thanks!",

Not as good as the real thing I am sure but still very tasty! Made a few changes: Used NY Strip steaks instead of rib-eye (delicious!) sauteed the spinach in garlic and olive oil before adding to pasta. Omitted olives added chopped onion and portabella mushroom to the steak instead of shallots. Used fresh grated parmesan cheese instead of feta. Definitely more of an italian taste than greek but was very delicious! Much lighter than I had expected. I will make this again and keep experimenting.",

When my husband came in he said it smelled like a restaurant. It was fun to make and unbelievably good with simple ingredients. I left out the olives and used asiago romano & parmesan cheese instead of the feta but I want to try it with feta. I had a bagged salad I needed to use so I served the pasta/steak mixture on a bed of greens and it was so good even down to the crunch of the sunflower seeds. Fantastic recipe Jennifer!",
