Not only did the bacon smell awesome cooking up but this dish tasted great! I just tossed in a couple of garlic cloves, chopped, cold cooked rice, added the cooked bacon, green onions and seasoned the rice with a little soy sauce, Hawaiian sea salt and black pepper. Lastly, I added in some cooked eggs that I made into an omelet and sliced thinly. This made a pretty side dish, was easy to prepare and delicious! Thou there is ample room where you can add other veggies and ingredients this was great as is.
