I used garlic powder because I just do not care to bite into garlic in a salad and then I found someone had eaten the grapes I was hoarding to make this so I added a handful of raisins (dried grapes, right?).   I also added some green onions that needed to be used.  I chilled this for an hour as stated, but next time, when I actually have grapes, I will make the salad either in the morning or night before.  This only gets better.  Thanks for a great chicken salad.",

I didn't replace all the butter because you really need some of the butter flavor. I used half the mayo and subbed plain yogurt for the other half. I also more than doubled the curry and used about 2/3 the garlic. I also added about a tsp of salt. I don't like drenched salad so after making the dressing up I gradually added dressing to the chicken and grapes until it hit the right mix. I saved the rest of the dressing to use on sandwiches. It's too good to waste! Lastly I recommend at least 8 hours in the fridge before serving for the flavors to really develop. The salad was a hit at a potluck and I will definitely make again....in fact I think this will become my signature potluck dish - doubling the recipe of course!",
