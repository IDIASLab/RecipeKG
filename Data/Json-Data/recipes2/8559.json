Add more seasonings (garlic powder, onion powder, turmeric, parsley and basil) and more mozzarella. I also added in a 1/4 cup peccorino romano cheese. Bake crust then put on toppings. If freezing a crust don't place toppings on until you are ready to bake and eat.",

I don't need to be but the husband is so I try everything. Now I will continue to do this crust because it is so delicious and truly a way to save on calories for someone who loves her carbs! What I did: Birds Eye 10 frozen cauli rice cooked as directed in bag then put in strainer as recipe called for ( I didn't see anything that drained but i had left in bag unopened for awhile) added the 1 egg and alittle less mozzo and more parmesan then added garlic salt and dried minced onion. I baked in 400 convection oven until it was browned and then added my toppings -1/2 green pesto and 1/2 marinara and then chicken artichokes roasted tomatoes and cheese on it all then back in oven until browned and bubbly. This really is only enough for one hungry person so make a double batch! I really could make this again for tomorrow night!",

Use parchment paper and save yourself a lot of agony. 2)Be sure to drain drain drain that cauliflower!. Extra moisture will make this crust crumble apart when you try to cut it. 3) Increased parmesan to 3 Tbsp 4) Mixed some well drained minced garlic into the dough mixture 5) Once dough was pressed out into the pan (and I pressed the dough really firmly) I took an additional egg white and brushed the top of the crust. 6)Then I LIBERALLY sprinkled italian seasoning garlic powder additional parmesan cheese and a little extra salt over the top of the crust before baking. 7) Finally I sprinkled the same items in #6 over the very top once I added the toppings. Steps 6 and 7 completely erased any trace of cauliflower flavor which was vital for us because my son won't touch anything remotely resembling a vegetable.",

Otherwise it ll taste like eating plain baked cauliflower. Make sure to literally squeeze the life out of the cauliflower and get out ever last drop of moisture or it will steam instead of getting baked and crispy. I d recommend letting it sit for 30 min or so to dry out a little more after squeezing it. Bake it longer than you think you need to before topping it. You almost have to burn the sides to get the middle crispy and baked well enough. This recipe is very basic hence the 3 star review but with some extra ingredients it is much better.:)",
