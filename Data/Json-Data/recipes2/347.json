I prefer the sauceless precooked packaged pulled pork for convenience.   To read more about how this recipe concept came to life visit Renee's Kitchen Adventures.",

I couldn't find the fully cooked port without sauce so I bought a BBQ rubbed Hormel Pork Roast for the slow cooker. Cooked it up and shredded it. It was divine using it with this little nummy nummy. Will totally make again we made these as a sandwich style snack and some open faced and prefer them better open faced by a show of 4 to 2 hands in my house. Thanks for a neat little morsel!",
