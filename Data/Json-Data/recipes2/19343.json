Even though I used only 1lb thin cut chicken I didn't change the rest of the portions. Fresh beans cooked for a minute in the micro left out the cilantro and added an extra dash of red pepper. Served with lime flavored basmati rice. I hoped the basil & mint flavors would come thru in the final dish like it does in Pho but maybe it's different when cooked this way vs. soup. Overall mine was a healthy dish packed with a lot of ingredients but not much excitement so I may try again with beef.",
