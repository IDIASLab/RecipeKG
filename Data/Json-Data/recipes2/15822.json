The only thing I do differently is I buy whatever cooked shrimp is on sale at the fish counter (I'm not wild about canned shrimp) and then I chop it into small bites and when I sprinkle it over the cream cheese mixture I press it into the cream cheese with the back of a spoon so it's not on top it's in the cheese sour cream mayo mixture. No one gets a bite with no shrimp that way. I love this recipe. It's perfect for when company comes or I cut it in half for just us.",

I usually use tortilla chips to serve instead of crackers. I've found that the taste of cocktail sauces vary. Some are somewhat overpowering. Try various ones to find one that you like. Guests have enjoyed this dish once it has a chance to sit a while. The flavors seem to gel together. I also suggest draining the tomato or removing the seeds. It will help the dish not get watery as it sits. My favorite part is the leftovers all thrown together in the bowl the next morning. Fantastic flavor.",
