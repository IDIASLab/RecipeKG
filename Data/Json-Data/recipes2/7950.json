I made a couple minor changes - For some reason I only bought one can of the chili beans so i added in a can of drained back ones that I had in the cupboard.. and I used red bell pepper since they were on sale for 25 cents and the green ones weren't. I cooked this in the crockpot too.. browned the meat and veggies and then tossed everything in for 6 hours on low",

I ended up transferring the meat from the skillet to a larger pot when I realized how much stuff was going to go in it. I'd probably just start with a decent sized stock pot and cook the chili in that. 2. I think I want a bit more of the yogurt mix to top off the chili. I'd probably double that next time. 3. The final product tasted a bit more like a tomato sauce than a chili so I think I'd substitute more tomatoes for some or all of the sauce. But overall it tasted fine and turned out okay.",
