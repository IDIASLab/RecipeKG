I didn't have any crackers so I substituted with Panko and flour: I had the eggs in one bowl Panko in another bowl and then the flour mixed with all the other spices in another bowl. Dipped the clams in the egg then in the flour mixture then in the panko and fried till golden brown. Yum!!! My husband who isn't really a big fan of fried clams thought they were delicious and ate them right up. Although I've lived in WA for over 15 years this was my first time digging for then preparing and eating razor clams. Now I'm a huge fan! =) Note: It's really super important to be sure to clean these clams properly as well as to make sure they are thoroughly patted dry with paper towels before you begin.",

I added some corn meal because I love the corn battered clams. It was flavorful and a hit with everyone even my boys - 4 and almost 2 - who would have thought? I found it works best if you fry them hot and quick. They don't turn out rubbery and they are very tender. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will use it over and over again.",
