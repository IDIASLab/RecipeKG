I had powdered turmeric & didn't realize this recipe called for the root until I'd put everything else in. So I put in a scoop of my powdered & added a roasted beet left over from last night's dinner. I probably used a little less cayenne pepper & subbed honey for stevia probably almost 1/2 tsp. It's really an interesting flavor I can definitely taste the beet but I love the spice & it's surprisingly really great! Next time I'll be sure to buy turmeric root so I can try it as its intended.",
