I do not eat ketchup, bbq sauce or tomato paste/sauce, and this recipe uses a great combo of spices instead of that same old tomato-based flavor. I also appreciate no onion! I made only a few small changes: I did not wrap with bacon, and instead of ground pork, I used Hot Pork Sausage in the mix. I used a large loaf pan, and at 350 it only needed about an hour. In the middle of the loaf I placed a string cheese just for fun. There was not as much grease as you would expect, I did not have to pour any off during cooking at all. The loaf did NOT crumble at all, and thick slices made great sandwiches for days! Thanks for the great recipe, it was perfect for our family.",

I did sub the bread crumbs out for almond flour to make it GF and I didn't experience any issues. I know the OP emphasizes that this is not a low fat dish -- which is fine with me of course (I made it and enjoyed it!) -- but the meatloaf is absolutely swimming in oil/fat when it's pulled out of the oven so just be prepared for that. I baked mine in glass loaf pans and the oil/grease/whatever was completely submerging the full lower half of the meatloaves. When they were cooked I removed the loaves from the pans and placed them on a cooling rack to drain off as much of the oil as possible. There is definitely no risk that you'll have a dry meatloaf with this recipe. This dish is very savory and very moist and my husband about died he loved it so much just be prepared for the oil/grease when you remove them from the oven.",
