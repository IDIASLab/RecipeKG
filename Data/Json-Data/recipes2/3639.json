I used fusilli since I'm out of fettucini, but any pasta will do.  I would make this again if I'm pressed for time.",

The Bird's Eye veggies tasted very fresh and tasty. They are very pretty and add so much color to the dish. A couple of tips if you grill the chicken and then slice it into thin strips it adds a lot of flavor plus cuts out the oil. How you feel about this dish is going to depend a lot on what type of sauce you use. I used a home made garlic-alfredo that I had prepared ahead of time. The garlic added a whole new delicious dimension to this. This is a great base but you're going to need to add spices. Garlic black pepper etc. whatever tickles your fancy will work with this.",

With shorter steps of a jar alfredo sauce frozen veggies and you could totally add the convenience of pre-cooked chicken to boot to make it faster and skip the step of slicing and cooking your chicken (for time constraints)...however the family enjoyed and was together in no time to fuss over.",
