I doubled the butter (which helped get rid of the tang from the cream cheese). I also added a little sugar and vanilla to add some sweetness and flavor. I pretty much just kept tasting it till it was what I was looking for. I used it for a cheesecake recipe and it was awesome. I've also since used it as a filling for stuffed french toast and it turned out delicious! I'll definitely make it again.",
