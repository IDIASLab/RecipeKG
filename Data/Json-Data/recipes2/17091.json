I must not have read the recipe very carefully because I mixed the shake n bake, cumin and chili powder in with the sausage and cheese mixture.  I guess it didn't make a difference because everyone that tried them absolutley loved them!!!  One other thing I did differently was I made actual eggs.  Instead  of slicing the jalapenos I used a paring knife to cut off the end of the pepper with the stem.  Then using the knife I scraoped the seeds off the inside ofthe pepper and poured them out.  I then put the cream cheese mixture in a baggie and cut a hole in the corner and filled the peppers.  I took some of the sauage mixture and wrapped it around the stuffed jalapenos.  Then baked as stated in the recipe.  If you do this remember that as the sausage cooks the fat cooks out and the sausge will shrink so make sure that it is covered well.  I had my peppers completely covered and when they finished baking I had peppers peeking out of the sauage, it didn't effect the taste at all, just presentation.",
