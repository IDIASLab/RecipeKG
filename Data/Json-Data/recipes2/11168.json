Only tweaks I made were using 3/4 lb ground beef but I will go back to 1/2 lb when I make this again because yes I will definitely make again. But I will use 4 pepper jack cheese sticks instead of two. Just needs a little more cheese. I didn t need a sushi mat just used a cutting board and it rolled up real easy. Highly recommend it s fun and delicious.",

While I liked the look the prosciutto gave the roll the taste seemed to have gotten lost. It is very expensive so I will leave that out next time. If you are wanting to impress that meat loving man of yours this is the recipe to do it with!",
