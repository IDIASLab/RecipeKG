Eyeballing as I went along, I used only one can of enchilada sauce and was happy I did... if I'd used two, it would have been WAY too soupy (there was already so much liquid in here because of the soup and creamy cheeses). I eyeballed the cheese topping vs using precise measurements and that turned out fine.  Also, minor note, I had bigger tortillas (8\") so used 5 of those (3 across, 2 on the end) instead of 8 as directed, and that turned out fine - a harmless substitution.  It didn't take the full cooking time either -- I cooked it about 25 minutes covered and that was sufficient to move to the next step. It was good but pretty mild (since I used mild sauce) and just a tad goopy.  When I make again, I may consider increasing the meat or adding more vegetables (sliced peppers, more onions, etc) so the filling has more substance to it.",
