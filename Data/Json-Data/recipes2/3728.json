I used candied cherries from last Christmas for the red & green. Wish I'd gotten a picture but no time for that before they had to be out the door and on their way to a meeting! Thanks for the recipe. P.S. I used parchment paper (and Pam spray on that too) bc no matter what you do to tinfoil it will sometimes stick. It's not trustworthy with sticky baked goods IMO!",
