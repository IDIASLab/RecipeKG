This is basically like a garlic bread spread but the addition of the cream cheese makes this rich and creamy. This is so simple to throw together and has so few ingredients - what's not to love? I blended everything together and you can easily \"tweak\" this to suit your tastes. I let it set in the fridge for a few hours to let the blend. Perfect over warm bread but also great on crackers and I might even try this on carrot or celery sticks...",

I spread this on the cut sides and popped it under the broiler. I think the cream cheese prevented this from browning the way I would have liked but the edges were starting to burn so I had to pull it out. This was good but just didn t appeal to us as much as some others. I did try the little I had leftover on pita chips and that was good but again not a favorite.",

This tastes so much like that! Any type of homemade bread stick would taste good with this. I changed it to 2 servings with the calculate button and it made about 1/4 cup so the full recipe is accurate on the 3/4 cup or 6 servings. To cut the sat. fat back some I used whipped cream cheese and butter with canola oil. I accidentally forgot to add the parmesan cheese. It must have been a good mistake because it didn't seem to need it. It would have lost the creamy consistency I think anyhow. I also used pre-minced garlic and it worked fine.",
