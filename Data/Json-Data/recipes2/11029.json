I actually did have orange-mango juice on hand and used a lot more mango than called for as well. In spite of that however the banana flavor definitely was the more prominent the mango taking a back seat. It didn t make this bad just disappointing given its title Mango-Banana Smoothie (perhaps it should be the other way around Banana-Mango Smoothie ). Hubs agreed it was more banana tasting than mango but said he didn t mind. He said it was just right sweet but I did add a smidge of Splenda and used vanilla yogurt.",
