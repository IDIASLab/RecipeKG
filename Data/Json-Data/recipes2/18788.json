I did find that the stuffing was a bit \"runnier\" than I expected...next time I will add bread crumbs and more peppers to the mixture before stuffing the tomatoes to make it \"stiffer\". I probably used too much goat cheese. I added toasted pine nuts because I had some on hand and it was delicious! UPDATE 5/12/08: I made this again this weekend with vine-ripened tomatoes from the farmer's market...this time I did incorporate about 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs in with the goat cheese. We didn't have peppers on hand so I skipped those but again added toasted pine nuts. DELICIOUS!!!! The goat cheese consistency was PERFECT with the added bread crumbs. My boyfriend said it was the best meal he's ever had we both LOVED these!!!! We used goat cheese that already had garlic and herb flavoring in it but if you have plain goat cheese you could add some yourself.",

I had rather large tomatoes so I used about 6 oz of goat cheese and about 3 tbsp of roasted red bell pepper that I roasted in the oven myself (brushed with olive oil and seasoned with just a wee bit of cracked pepper and kosher salt) Everyone in my house loved them. Next time I might add a little bit of roasted garlic to the goat cheese mixture for extra flavor but this was wonderful as is. Thanks for a great recipe.",
