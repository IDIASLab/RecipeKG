Other than that, I made the recipe as written leaving out the optional sunflower seeds. They didn't seem to fit to me. After tasting the mixture I added more sesame oil out of personal preference. This recipe was good and tasted just like an egg roll without the wrapper. Because I didn't want to just serve it in a bowl and because the point of this recipe is  to eliminate the fried wrapper, I met in the middle. I made my own bowls by baking them in the oven. Good recipe and one I would make again. Don't forget to drain the grease!",
