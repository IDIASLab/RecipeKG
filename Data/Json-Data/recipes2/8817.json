With some crusty bread, it is a meal all in itself. It is easily adaptable to your family's preferences. I sometimes add other kinds of marinated vegetables and/or strips of mozzarella cheese or provolone cheese.",

I held off with my review until Hubs weighed in and he agreed, this is no ordinary tuna pasta salad!  It\u2019s light but flavorful, colorful, interesting, and satisfying.  I loved everything about this salad except for one, major thing \u2013 adding chopped lettuce to this, unless it is eaten immediately, did not appeal to me.  If you want the lettuce, it would be best to leave it out of the salad itself and serve the salad on top of a bed of lettuce.  Other than that I would not omit anything; each ingredient is vital.  If I were to add anything, it might just be a little red or green onion.  BUT \u2013 the success of this salad will only be as good as the quality of the ingredients you use - good, olive oil packed tuna for instance. Stay away from commercial \u201cItalian-style\u201d salad dressing if possible, and make your own.  I made a light, fresh lemon vinaigrette which was simply perfect here.  My 5-star rating assumes the lettuce is omitted and that a homemade dressing rather than a bottled commercial dressing is used.",

Just delicious. \n\nI followed the advice of another commenter and kept my leafy greens separate from the rest, using them as a bed when serving - very good advice. \n\nI didn't have Italian dressing on hand, so I just liberally dressed the whole thing with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt, pepper, olive oil, and white wine vinegar in that order. After serving, we sprinkled some French fried onions on top for crunch, as well as a little parm and red pepper flakes. \n\nI will definitely be making this again! So, so tasty.",
