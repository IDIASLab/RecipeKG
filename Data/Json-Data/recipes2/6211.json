                "reviewBody": "This one's a winner! Very fresh and bright flavor. The chipotles are a perfect addition! My chicken breasts were rather large so I used 3 instead of 4. Instead of 2 cans of chicken broth (29oz) I just used 1 carton (32oz) which worked out great because this soup is pretty hearty. I ended up using 3 chipotle peppers minced with 2 tbsp adobo sauce (about half the can). This made the soup about a medium spicyness. Trying to use only the leaves of the cilantro is kind of a hassle but I ended up using the leaves as best I could with some stems too. One bunch seems like a lot but the bunch I had was small-medium size so it worked out well. I recommended starting out with half a bunch if yours is large then adding more in if necessary. Also it's not really necessary to dirty a bowl just to mix the cilantro and tomato. Just throw it into the pot at the same time. The only addition I needed to make was a bit of salt to really bring out the flavors. Such a simple recipe but SO good! I can't wait to have this for lunch tomorrow! EDIT TO ADD: This makes 4 HUGE servings! You could easily get 6 smaller servings.",

I also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of fresh ones. (I was pressed for time.) The chipotle flavor was amazing...especially with pepper jack cheese tortilla chips and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich!!!;-)",
