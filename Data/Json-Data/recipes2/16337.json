This isn't roasting, it's steaming! For a nice medium rare roast, season with salt and garlic, heat oven to 350\u00b0F. Place roast, fat side up, in shallow roasting pan. Insert ovenproof meat thermometer so tip is centered in thickest part of beef, not resting in fat or touching bone. **Do not add water or cover.** Roast 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 hours for medium rare; 2-3/4 to 3 hours for medium doneness. Thermometer should read 115 degrees for rare when you remove the roast from the oven (temperature will increase about 10 degrees while it stands before carving).",

Two more good tricks is to cover the meat in the salt and a steak seasoning blend then let set over night to soak in the meat. Then after it is baked and sets about 10-15 min. the salt on top has formed a crust then you simply remove the salt crust and it will not be as salty. All that flavor goes into the meat.",

OK I admit I was dumb and I did not read the reviews before I started this recipe. Halfway through the cooking process I took a peek at the roast and was horrified (in a chef/cook sort of way). The meat was grey looking and I couldn't see how it was going to look any prettier in an hour...this was my Christmas meal and I do like to \"present\" the meal at the table. So I panicked and decided to read the other comments to this recipe - I do wish I had done so prior to placing the meat in the oven... silly me. I ended up dumping the water uncovering the roast scraping off some of the salt and it came out OK. Some of my guests felt it was a bit salty (especially if you like to eat the crunchy outside of the meat) but I think it was OK -- which is not a good thing with such an expensive cut of meat. If you are consious of the amount of money you spend on a good cut of meat I would stick with the \"tired and true\" recipe which one of the other folks who commented recaped for us.",

After reviewing many recipes I decided to roast the meat uncovered at 500 degrees for 15 minutes followed by 325 degrees until done (about 1 1/2 hours total). I like my meat medium rare so I removed it when it measured 125 degrees in the center(the temperature will continue to rise). I let it rest for 20 minutes and scraped off the excess salt before carving. For the au jus I used a packet mix which was great however diluting the scraped seasonings with water would have made a nice au jus too.",
