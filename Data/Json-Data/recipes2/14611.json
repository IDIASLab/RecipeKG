Added a bit of this and that; mini chips raisins butterscotch chips and some chopped up Hershey kisses w/Almonds I had left...enough to equal 2 cups total. They baked up beautifully didn't spread much so can put quite a few on the sheet without fear of overcrowding. They actually didn't taste like cakemix at all. Great recipe that did what it promised. Numerous variation possibilities make this a lovely versatile recipe.",

I think that had to do with the addition of baking powder to the cake mix. I misread the recipe & added 2/3 cups of oats & 1/2 cup butter. I found it to be enough butter because the mixture was quite oily. I used a Pillsbury Classic Yellow cake mix which has pudding in it; omitted the chocolate chips but added raisins instead. Will try again but omit the baking powder & increase the oats as well. I think we were expecting more of a soft chewy oatmeal type cookie. They are a very easy & fast cookie to make.",
