I seasoned them with black pepper and garlic salt. I used a can of diced tomatoes onion and bell pepper. I mixed the tomato mixture with a can of diced tomatoes Morning Star Veggie Chicken strips diced up and a can of cream of mushroom. I poured that on top the roasted veggies then added the feta and some shredded cheddar. Then the puff pastry. I baked it about 30 minutes. The kids loved it. It was called the stuff that taste like pizza and the stuff that is like chicken pot pie. It was a hit with the non-vegetarians. Will make again with my modifications.",
