I am not super familiar with working with crescent rolls. My suggestion is to go for the name brand. That is the only one I worked with. I had someone else pick up the ingredients with this and they had gotten the store brand. I had a heck of a time getting the rolls apart and even had to re-shape them. The filling is not enough for the crescents. It has to be added in between each rolled crescent making a perfect circle. This works find as long as it is baked on parchment paper. The cheese holds the ingredients together. All of the flavors go well together. Thanks!",
