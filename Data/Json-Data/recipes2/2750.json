Use double the butter, softened, not melted (wanted it to make sure it piped well for cupcakes), and you will end up with something really rich, smooth, velvety and deeply,decadently chocolate that's like eating spoonable fudge.  Simply a drop dead gorgeous frosting.",

I have used this frosting for cakes, brownies, and cupcakes. It's great because you can make it as thin or as thick as you need it depending on your preference. I would suggest adding the confectioners sugar and milk as you need them to obtain your desired consistency. Great recipe! Thanks shellann13!",
