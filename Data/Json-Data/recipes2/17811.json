I could really taste everything and it blended very well together. I felt like baking the chicken was not necessary and would heat up the house.  So I cooked it on the stove top.  I cooked the bacon first then I used the bacon grease to cook the chicken, (depending on how fatty your bacon is you might want to drain some of it off). Then while I chopped the chicken into small bite size pieces I cooked the zucchini and squash in the same pan.  After cut, I put the chicken back in the pan.  Once everything was cooked how I liked it, then I sprinkled evenly the parm cheese, nuts, and bacon on top, but did not stir in.  It gives it a very pretty presentation. I coated the pasta with the Alfredo Sauce.  I would put it on the plate, and put the chicken mixture on top. I rarely ever give something 5 stars, mostly because I ignore those reviews and look at the 2-4s, however this was too good to give a 4. ",

I sauted the chopped garlic in oil for just a minute or two before adding the cubed the chicken and squashes.  Just before all were done I added about 1/2 cup slice mushrooms and the diced sun-dried tomatoes.  I then tossed in the cooked hot pasta and the Alfredo sauce with milk along with 1/4 cup real bacon bits (instead of cooking and crumbling bacon) and heated everything through.  I omitted the almonds and I added the Parmesan at the table because some don't like it.  We loved this and with the changes I didn't dirty all the dishes in the kitchen.  We'll definitely make again!  Thanks!",
