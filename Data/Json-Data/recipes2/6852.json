Lastly, it's incredibly moist and full of flavor. Convinced yet? Just try it! I made the recipe exactly as written. I'm not a big fan of ground ginger, but I used it anyway and I couldn't even really taste it - I may just omit it next time. Still a winner recipe in this house!  All the flavors are really subtle.   I used a 2.5lb roast and it cooked about 1hr 15mins, only because I was a little late coming home. Even still, it was incredibly juicy. I may have eaten a bit too much. :)",
