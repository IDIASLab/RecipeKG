The recipe calls for the addition of 1 or 2 oz butter and 2-3 Tbs golden syrup (which is similar to runny honey or perhaps Aunt Jemima). The quantities vary somewhat in the recipes I've seen. Corn flakes also work well in place of the Rice Krispies. I've seen these topped with little candies. It's really easy if you modify the recipe and usually a hit.",
