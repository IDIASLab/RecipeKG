        "description": "I came up with a very quick, easy lower-in-fat dip or sauce to make with those leftover chipotle peppers. This dip combines the smoky chipotle with the great seasoning of ranch dressing mix. Makes a great veggie dip, or even a topping on hamburgers or Mexican foods. Chipotle peppers are very spicy; start with one and taste. Removing seeds will tone down the heat. I usually use 2 with seeds. You can also substitute low-fat Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.",

Please note the recipe calls for \"1 canned\" chipotle pepper NOT 1 can of chipotle peppers as I almost did. The first batch I made as written using 1 pepper. The second time I added 2 1/2 peppers. I think my can must have been pretty mild as it took the 2 1/2 peppers to get the added kick to the dip. Although when I make it again with a new can I will start with 1 pepper. It definitely gets a little warmer after it is refrigerated overnight. This dip is great and I know I will be making it many times over the summer. It was also VERY tasty on a baked potato. I like that it uses light mayo and sour cream. Thanks Sherri for sharing your recipe - it is a keeper.",

I so wanted to try this but in deference to Hubs sensitive innards I had to modify it just a bit I used just a teensy bit of chipotle chili powder and a drop of liquid smoke to simulate the chipotle chili. Loved the chipotle/ranch combo as well as the addition of FRESH green onion and garlic rather than powdered or dried. The lime juice was a unique plus adding both freshness and flavor. All and all it is a delicious dip with all seasonings balanced and will certainly get your guests to ask Hmmm this is so delicious! What s in it?",
