I cooked the onion and meat in a bit of butter also adding diced turkey sausage patties for about 5 minutes then added the bell pepper and two shakes of dried parsley since I didn't have fresh and cooked for another 7-8 minutes. I also added the tomato salt and pepper in the last 2 minutes. Once done I placed a small layer of finely shredded fiesta blend cheese on one half of the cooked egg (sprayed pan I used for egg with an olive oil spray and beat egg with salt and pepper added) then placed the mixture on top and folded the egg over that. Served some with sour cream and salsa. GREAT breakfast thanks!!",
