Always just rinsed, patted dry and rolled in flour that salt and pepper had been added to and then pan fried in butter.  If you are lucky enough to find a lot of morels and don't want to cook them all they are so easy to dry.  Simply string them, and allow them to dry out in a cool dark place and them put them in a mason jar or baggie to keep the moisture out.  When you are in the mood for them, simply re-hydrate them  in water and use as usual.  My Grandfather used to do this and send them to me.  Happy memories.",
