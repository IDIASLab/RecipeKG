I used a pizza cutter to cut the bread into thirds and added a little sugar to the egg/milk mixture along with a bit of vanilla and cinnamon for good measure. Once they were done I topped them off with some confectioners' sugar and real maple syrup. Great way to start your morning.....",

I started making them before church on Sunday and also made them on Monday Tuesday and today is Wed and I'll be making them again!! It is also a kid friendly recipe since my 7 yr old daughter helps with all the process! I also added a pinch of cinnammon to the egg mixture and also a tsp of vainilla. You might also need extra bread and extra corn flakes to finish up the egg mixture. Since my bread was very soft I decided no to cut them in thirds but rather leave them whole. Serve them with condensed milk and strawberries. They are delicious! Thank you pamplemousse!",

My boyfriend said: \"It's like eating French toast and a bowl of cereal at the same time.\" Like other reviewers I added some cinnamon to the egg mixture. I also added a bit of sugar. I think next time I will use frosted flakes instead of adding the sugar. I also only slightly crush the corn flakes this gives it more of a crunch. These are sure to become a new favorite breakfast for us thank you for the recipe!!:D",
