I followed the rest of the recipe as is minus the mushrooms and I didn't mind the broccoli cheese soup I also added salt and pepper to taste and sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on top! I thought it turned out fine I think the garlic helped to add some flavor. No leftovers so didn't get a chance to try it reheated. This wasn't the best dish I've made but it's quick and easy so i'm sure I'll be making it again in the future!!",

I always add onions to everything so I was glad to see that they were indeed an ingredient that was just omitted from the list. 1. I sauteed the onion and pepper in olive oil with a little garlic powder then added the sausage. 2. I used shell pasta (8 oz. or 1/2 box) instead of rice because we'd had rice twice already this week. 3. I added some seasoned salt and fresh cracked black pepper to give it a little oomph at the very end. All in all it was quite tasty. I agree with others that another cheesy soup (Fiesta Nacho etc.) might boost this flavor more.",
