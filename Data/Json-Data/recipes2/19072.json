Serve with basmati rice and a cool cucumber and tomato salad. I created this recipe after a small ethnic restaurant in our neighborhood closed.  Their curry chicken and peanuts was wonderful.

I'm not really a very good cook and even I couldn't screw this one up.:) I think the level of taste really depends on what kind of curry you use and you could definitely spice it up with spicier curry. But as is it made for a great light tasty dinner. The sauce was delicious I felt like I was in a restaurant. Put it over a bed of jasmine rice and you'd have a great dinner.",

While the chicken was cooking in the resulting liquid the onions were moved to a small glass dish and mixed with about a cup of shredded coconut flakes (I had no coconut milk). When the chicken was nearly ready to reintroduce the onion mixture I added about a half cup of Smuckers natural peanut butter stirred to coat liquifying the pb and thickening the sauce. I returned the onions to the pan tossed on a healthy sprinkle of garlic powder a chunk of cinnamon stick and a fair bit of cayenne pepper for zip then added some Progresso chix stock to allow for some simmering activity. As an after thought I tossed in some frozen peas to break up the monotonous curry color (also cooled it down to eat faster!). It thickened up over the next half hour or so and we ate it over rice.",
