For some reason it is listed as 2 tablespoons of Old Bay and Worchestershire but it is actually 2 teaspoons of each ingredient. 2 tablespoons of each is way too much. Until I can get the actual online recipe adjusted to reflect the correct measurements please just remember to adjust the seasonings to 2 teaspoons of each. Thanx! :)",

I added 4oz of cream cheese and 6oz more of crabmeat (I love crab!) and reduced the seasonings to 1 tsp of Old Bay 1 tsp of Worchestershire 1/4 tsp pepper and added 4 Tbsp of whipping cream to help the mixture spread over the marinara sauce. The concept is great just the portions were excessive.",

The Old Bay was way to strong and combined with the black pepper...ewww i could'nt even taste anything else! i had to send my hubby out to get more ingredients so i could start over...i ended up using the crab cream cheese and instead of white chedder i used orange sharp shredded chedder.(and for the layer on bottom i used a nice marinara instead of spaghetti sauce) it actually ended up tasting way better and very much like i remembered at Olive Garden in my opinion it doesn't need any of those spices they are too over powering i still served it with the sliced baguettes it was a hit at the picnic and i will make it again this same way of course!",
