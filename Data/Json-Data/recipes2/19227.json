I made a couple changes to this recipe using what I prefer and what I had on hand. I think the cranberry juice would be good but I only had apple juice. I also substituted the serbet for low fat vanilla yogurt. The blend of the strawberries bannana and orange was wonderful! I couldn't taste even a hint of the whey (which I used the unflavored kind)!!!!! Thanks for the recipe I now have a new lunch!!!",
