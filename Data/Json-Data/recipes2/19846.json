Pleeeease.what use would I have for less than half a can of leftover creamed corn? I love recipes that utilize already prepared canned goods. Can you imagine if you had to cream your own corn before making a simple side dish casserole? But since I do value the canned goods in a recipe I also deduct from the worthiness of any recipe that doesn t utilize a whole standard can size worth of the ingredients. Use the leftovers in another recipe? Maybe but I have to make an effort to find and cook a recipe that uses another half a can of that ingredient! Most times a leftover like that ends up money in the garbage after it turns green in the refrigerator. I don t like that! I used only about a Tablespoon of milk to make up for the additional liquid of the entire can of creamed corn (since I did use it anyway). Mind you maybe this wasn t the way to go because the cornbread base seemed kind of dense and took about 50 minutes to cook. It was nice and moist though. Don t let the hot sauce fool you I couldn t even detect it in the recipe when it was finished. Use a lot more if you want it to taste a little spicy. The saut\u00e9ed onions were delicious but I think I ll stick to them on my hamburgs and hot dogs not in a casserole. The sour cream and cheese was the best part. This really didn t seem like a casserole but more like a stiff cornbread pudding. I ve made",
