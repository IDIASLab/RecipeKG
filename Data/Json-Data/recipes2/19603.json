Only thing I would say is depending on your stove top I would cook it at a slightly lower temperature because mine burned on the first side until I turned the stove down. Also I tossed the salad on top with a little olive oil salt n pepper. This is surprisingly excellent! I'll definitely be making this again! Can't believe my meat eating husband even loved it.",
