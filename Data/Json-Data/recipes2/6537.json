Being that my paternal grampa was from Greece I highly recommend trying this recipe with Feta instead of goat cheese;-) They taste awesome grilled too! One more tip for those who might like to try an additional flavoring is to whisk together an equal amount of honey and red wine vinegar for drizzling.",

Three minor changes I made were 1) to use Panache Tiger Strip Fig 2) topped with diced thick sliced bacon instead of prosciutto and 3) I didn't drizzle with honey as the figs were juicy and sweet on their own. Truly delicious! Shared the recipe with friends; will definitely make this again.",
