We tend to serve it with regular cabbage bell peppers cauliflower broccoli and just basically our favorite veggies & italian bread. In my experience in making it people either love it or hate it.

I saute' the garlic in butter and olive oil in an electric frying pan on low then add the anchovies and let it all simmer then add a Tablespoon of vinegar (an Italian lady told me to do it) and mix well. We never put cream in it but if I did I would not put in very much. Then we have a tray of assorted veggies and sliced French or Italian crusty bread and folks stand around the same electric pan using the bread as a \"plate\" and dip the veggies in the hot sauce and use the bread to catch the drips and munch away. Great conversation starter and so good with some good red wine!",

The taste in itself was very good but wasn't anything that would top the ordinary. I used 4 cups of heavy cream and 1 cup of milk. I also put in 2 cans of anchovies which gave it much more flavor. Did not change the amount of garlic or butter. I added a large pinch of flour (about 1 1/2 TBSP) thinking it would thiken up the sauce but that did not help either. The mixture cooked for about 45 minutes med/low (simmering lightly) at which point I gave up on trying to get it to thicken. I give this a \"B\" and figure maybe I'll try it again since it's not very hard to make and now knowing that the sauce will never thicken to my desired consistency I will not need to cook it for longer than 20 minutes.",
