The pudding made them a bit gummy inside, and they weren't as fluffy as regular Bisquick pancakes. They tasted fine, but I was hoping for more butterscotch flavor. They had a tendency to cook quickly and burn before they were done. My daughter and I love trying new pancake recipes, so thanks for something different.",
