I did sprinkle the fish (Tilapia) with seafood seasoning mixed some cheese into the sauce used paprika instead of chili (feeding wee ones) and added garlic pepper to the potatoes. Without the spice additions I could see how it would be veeeery bland. So my suggestion season every layer to taste and you have a wonderful dish that makes GREAT leftovers.",
