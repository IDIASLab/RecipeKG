I did add fresh chopped basil, parsley, and 1 tsp. dried italian seasoning.  I also crushed 1 clove of garlic, as I love the flavor of garlic with feta.  I used both calamata and green olives.  I measured everything and even with the 1.25 # of meat, I thought 2 eggs seemed a bit much.  This is a rather loose mixture and wanted to make this into kabobs and serve w/a yogurt sauce.  The nice thing is that there are a variety of ways in which these can be prepared besides meatballs.  Hamburgers on the grill, kabob, etc.  I would love to make these on the grill as kabobs this summer; will either cut it down to 1 egg or keep it at 2 and throw in a few tbsp. of dried bread crumb.  Give this recipe a try for something new and flavorful!  Can substitute any other ground meat.  Would be great with ground turkey since that has a tendency to be dry and flavorless by itself.",
