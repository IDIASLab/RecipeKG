I was worried the rice would be total mush and it was very soft but I can't say it was bad - it reminded me of risotto and the flavor was phenomenal I was suprised that such simple ingredients would produce such great taste. The salmon didn't have nearly as much flavor from the pesto as I thought it would - it basically tasted like... salmon without any added flavors; can't say it's bad just not what I expected; basically if you have great tasting piece of fish why mask the taste? Overall I'll definitely make this again though I might reduce the liquid by 1/2 of a cup and cooking time by 10 minutes. Also even though my pesto was salty when I tasted it the salmon needed more salt so I'd salt the fish prior to cooking. Overall definitely a good easy dish to prepare that doesn't require a lot of special ingredients.",

I think the rice is just a bit bland and maybe could use a little something. I subbed chicken broth for the fish broth and also sprinkled a little parmesan on top when almost finished cooking as another reviewer suggested. I also recommend skinning the salmon. It was good but not great. Maybe next time I'll try rice with a seasoning packet in place of the plain white rice.",
