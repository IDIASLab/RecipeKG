In addition to the bacon I added shredded parmesan and thick-sliced mushrooms. I used regular salt instead of seasoned salt and no garlic powder. I also soaked the toothpicks to prevent burning. Next time I'm going to add either cooked rice or barley and roasted red peppers.",

Skirt steak works also but the low cost of flank makes an economical meal and is also fun to work with.",
