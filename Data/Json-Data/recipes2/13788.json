I used an Italian seasoning blend (the kind that is sold in its own grinder) and extra black pepper and garlic powder. Next time I will use real diced onions for more flavor. I also want to try more vegetables such as bell peppers or asparagus. Perhaps some cheese as well or alternatively sprinkling some lemon juice over the top. Tabasco sauce would also be a nice change of pace.... (I could go on and on and on...) --- PS: I forgot to mention how easy this is.",

I used a bit less than the spices called for as I sprinkled them over the top and didn't measure just eyeballed them. I used onion powder instead of fresh. The rosemary gave this a wonderful italian flavor. So easy so delicious and so easy on the budget too! Thanks for sharing this little gem.",
