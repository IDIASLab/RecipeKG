It may take awhile to braise, but it really doesn't take much time to prepare. I could also see this being made into a slow cooker meal as well. The meat is fall apart tender and full of flavor. Great with polenta or garlic mashed potatoes!",

Glad that I took the chance because this was oh so good. The only change was that I used fresh baby bella mushrooms its all I had. Will definitely use the dry porcinis next time as I think they will hold up better. Thank you Robert for sharing!",
