                "reviewBody": "I made this & it turned out great! I tweaked a few things, if anyone is looking for ideas & tips:\n\nI used 4-6 slices of sourdough bread (torn into bite sized pieces). I also cut up a slightly stale pumpernickel bagel & mixed it in with the sourdough bread \"cubes\", then used as directed. The bagel was the BEST part! Next time I make this I may very well use only bagels!\n\nCooking the onion in the bacon grease is CRUCIAL! Don't skimp on that part! \n\nI added two browned italian sausages (hot dog size) as well as 8-10 slices of bacon. The sausages brought in some delicious flavor & variety of texture.\n\nI didn't have cottage cheese, so I used soft cream cheese. The cottage cheese probably would have been easier to spread. But honestly, I don't think this step is crucial. Use whatever you have on hand that sort of resembles soft cheese & you'll be fine. Goat cheese would be fun to try.\n\nFinal \"tweak\": when it was ready to go into the oven, I thought it looked a little dry. So I whisked one more egg with about 2-3 TBLS heavy cream & drizzled it over the top of the whole pan.\n\nThis dish smelled & tasted AMAZING. It reheated beautifully next day. Also worked great to freeze individual portions & save for future!",
