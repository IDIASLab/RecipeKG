I even used a cheap tequila we had sitting around for years and I was very impressed with the results. If you like the lime to shine through, use extra.",

When first making it the tequila was overwhelming so I added a little more honey and lime juice. Luckily after letting the ingredients mingle for about 4 hours the alcohol taste was taken down a lot. But as one reviewer mentioned it was missing something. I didn't taste the lime even though I put extra in. Overall it was ok on chicken but I probably won't try it again.",

There was nothing wrong with it and it smelled wonderful while cooking.

I doubt I will make it again but thank you for the chance to try something new.",
