I left out the mushrooms and corn but this is not a significant deviation from the intent of this recipe. Until the last minute I was going to shy away from the jalapeno thinking it had no place here. While it provided no heat (which comes from the seeds and membrane) it did just enough to enhance the flavor. Measuring the ingredients isn't necessary and would take away from the simple joy of preparing this recipe if you did. I love herbs and spices but I disagree with those who said this was bland and required the addition of herbs. What's important is the wine the garlic and the wonderful combination of colorful fresh vegetables. These are simple fresh flavors--not bland flavors that need doctoring. Perfect as written this was also the perfect complement to the grilled chicken and patty pan squash we served with it.",
