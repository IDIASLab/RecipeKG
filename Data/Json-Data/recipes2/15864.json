I made the meat into six 4x2 loaves instead of one big loaf they cook in about 25-30 minutes and each person gets their own. Also I made a well in the top of each one and filled with a mixture of sour cream and picante sauce and then topped with cheese during the last 5 minutes of cooking. The people in my house gave it a thumbs up.",
