After it came out of the oven I put some sliced avocado and tomatoes on and it was a hit! My boyfriend couldn't get enough (in fact writing this review makes me want to whip one up right now!!!)

Second, I used refried black beans instead of the regular black beans in the mixture.  Third, I added cumin to the black bean mixture for extra seasoning.  Finally, I used mostly Monterrey Jack and Pepper Jack cheeses instead of most of the cheddar.  This turned out pretty well with the changes, but was still a little dry.  However, a little bit of salsa and sour cream on the top fixed that.  I think I'll be making this again, and in the meantime try to think of some more changes to make it even better.  I think I'll try to add some black olives and other vegetables to it.",
