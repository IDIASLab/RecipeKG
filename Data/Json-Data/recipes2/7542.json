The Chef reluctantly mentioned that frozen fruit can be used (if you must.).  :)  My skepticism grew while mixing the crumb topping - it seemed too dry and simple - but I resisted the urge to alter the recipe.  Since the strawberries were still frozen when I put them in the oven, I watched for the fruit to be bubbling over the crust at the entire circumference of the pan.  This ended up adding about 12 minutes of baking time.  Perhaps the previous reviewers didn't adjust baking time for frozen filling, but there was nothing soupy about how this treat turned out.  The ratio of effort-to-outcome of this recipe is off the charts .",
