I then took out the insides and mashed them in a pot so it was chunky. In addition to the tomato soup I added dried basil oregano onion powder a touch of salt and freshly minced garlic. I needed to add a lot more chicken broth than directed because it was very thick. Once it was to my desired consistency it was fantastic! We served it w/Big Y snowflake rolls- super yummy and great for dipping. We will be making it again but will need to make a larger amount because it was such a hit w/my family kids included (3 & 7).",
