A very simple recipe, but the flavor is impressive. The only issue i have is that once you put the beans on the grill pan, the garlic tends to brown too quickly and gets a bitter taste.  I was able to scoop the beans out of the pan with most of the burnt garlic staying behind in the pan ridges, without worrying about it affecting the flavor too much.  I think next time I will lightly crush the garlic cloves, leaving them mostly whole so that they can easily be lifted out prior to grilling. Thanks for the recipe Kassie!",
