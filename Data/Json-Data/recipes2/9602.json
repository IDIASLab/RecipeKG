Don\u2019t be tempted to substitute light coconut milk for regular.  The fat in the coconut is a healthy fat and the flavor and creaminess of regular coconut milk cannot be beat.  I squeezed a little more lime over each individual serving and it was delicious served over cauliflower rice with fresh asparagus on the side.  I will definitely make this quick, easy, and healthy fish dish again.",
