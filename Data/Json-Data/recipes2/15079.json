I put all the ingredients in a pan (and included an egg per the advice from a previous review.) and when I went to add the butter I went with my gut instinct to leave it out. This turned out delicious very creamy not soupy. The bacon adds a great flavor. Think I'll garnish with scallions next time. Great recipe!",
