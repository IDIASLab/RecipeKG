I had a lot of apple cider on hand and decided to whip up this cake to share with my parents in-laws neighbors and co-workers. Two people can't possibly eat an entire cake! The results were a very good and moist cake. I was worried after pouring the glaze on the cake if it would release from the greased/floured pan. No problems it flipped right out. I did poke hole in the cake before pouring the glaze over it. Delicious! I would definitely make this one again.",
