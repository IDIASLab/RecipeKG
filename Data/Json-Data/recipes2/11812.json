We both though the egg and the bread crumbs made it seem more like meat loaf than hamburgers though.  I have no idea what 'Asian Seasoning blend' is so I just left it out.  Next time I think I will skip the bread crumbs and egg add a bit less teriyaki sauce.  I did these on the grill and that added a nice dimension to the taste of the burgers.",

The minced ginger and the ground ginger really make the flavor in these burgers. I chose to make my own buns using Chef John's \"Homemade Hamburger Buns\" on this site. Very good!",

I believe it was probably a mind thing with my family and I....as in when you're planning on eating a burger you expect burger texture....if I had served this as meat loaf...they would have liked it just fine...again the flavor is great just the texture is off for a \"hamburger\"....must serve with the grilled pineapple!
