I then put pork chops back on top, added a glass cover and popped it in the oven for approx. 25 minutes.  Saved on clean-up that way.

The kids love it and love helping wash veggies and chopping them with my Pampered Chef food chopper. (It really makes things like this easy.) I also baked in stonware for a better taste. Serve it over fresh rice and the corn-rice combo makes it extra healthy. I trimmed the fat off the chops so it is really low fat. This recipe would work for chicken or beef and be just as delicious!",
