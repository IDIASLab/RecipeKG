It's sort of bland but not unlike a good Irish cabbage meal--I'd say it needs to be served with a peppery meat dish to be a good compliment. BTW--we used green peppers (for the expense issue) and it was fine. I'm sure the red pepper would add that extra little flavor (I love the red yellow & orange bell peppers!) but it's out of our current budget. Works fine with green bell. I'll fix this again...for St. Patty's Day!",
