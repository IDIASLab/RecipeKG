I used cayenne powder instead of fresh cayenne; deleted pequin chile pepper and added instead part of a poblano pepper and about 6 chiltepin peppers (a very hot little pepper). The chiltepin peppers grow wild in my area of Texas. I also deleted the white onion mentioned and used instead some wild white onions that grow here (they're hotter). I used Stubb's Spicy BBQ Sauce for the sauce mentioned in the recipe and used 2 cans of pinto beans instead of just one. This recipe came out very well and the people eating it even favorably remarked that they didn't have to add any hot sauce to spice it up. I served it with shredded cheddar cheese extra chopped onion and jalapeno cornbread.",
