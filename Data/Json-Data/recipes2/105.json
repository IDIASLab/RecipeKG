I had some meat left over but I used a 1/3 cup scoop for each one with a hefty pinch of a three cheese blend. I just pulled up the biscuits like wontons. In the future I would probably simmer the joe mix longer to cut down on the juice a little more. I baked for 12 minutes checked and then put back for another 3. I would probably make longer next time. Somewhat labor intensive making the pouches but worth t if you have patience. If you get frustrated easily I'd stay away from this recipe.",
