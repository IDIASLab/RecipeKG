This is a recipe I came up with combining two of my favorite foods, the cheesesteak and chili. This is a great recipe to make for parties or the big game. Throw it in a slow cooker to keep warm, and it feeds an army.",

I didn't have Cheez Whiz (which of course would have made it more authentic) but I did use a condensed cheddar cheese soup and softened cream cheese whipped together to get a similar consistency tempering/blending them both in towards the end of cooking. I also used diced fire roasted tomatoes as opposed to the spicy tomato sauce cause the three year old can handle some heat but I didn't want any crying during dinner:) Thank you Dan for sharing this recipe! My husband has already put in requests for this dish more often during football season.",
