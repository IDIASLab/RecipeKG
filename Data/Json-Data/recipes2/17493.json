I'm almost postive this is the same recipe that my grandmother used but once I started making it on my own I added a few things. I like it a little more thick like a stew so a make a reux with butter flour and chopped onion. Once the oysters have been sauteed in the butter and the reux is done I combine everything including the half and half into one put and add a splash of worchestire sauce. I love this stew and look forward to passing this tradition on to my own two daughters as long as I can get them to try it. I may have to do what my grandmother did and tell them it's potatoe soup:).",
