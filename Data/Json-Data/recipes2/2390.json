You have to add some spices and fresh veggies for some more flavor double the chicken and add more gravy. The spices I added were salt pepper onion powder garlic powder thyme and sage. I added this to two large chicken breasts as they cooked and also a tad bit more to the mix. The gravy I made was 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 can of cream of mushroom. I also chopped up 1/2 a green pepper into small pieces 1/4 onion 1 stalk of celery (and the leaves) and 1 Clove of garlic for fresh flavor along with the frozen veggies (only 6oz of the frozen veggies necessary). This recipe made a lot of left over filling. That's the best part. When the pies are done cooking (I cooked for 25 mins) it's necessary to top with extra filling (yummy). I also topped these mini pies with shredded cheese before cooking! A!",

So easy and so good. family loved them too. Next time I might at some garlic powder and onion powder but the were really good just as the recipe alone.",
