I think you could also use the canned chicken chunks which would cut down on the cooking time of the chicken breast. I will definitely cook this again.",

While I was defrosting the chicken breasts in the microwave I cooked the pasta and as I was waiting for the oven to preheat (because I forgot about that part) I chopped the onion and grated the cheese.

I cooked my chicken in olive oil and seasoned it with garlic salt and pepper. After I cooked the chicken I cooked a few strips of bacon and some onions and added that to the mixture. I also added a 3 cheese blend of romano parm and asiago. Mixed in a liitle milk some more salt pepper and garlic and it was absolutely great. My 2 and 4 year olds gobbled it up! Not the most healthy way to go but a great hearty meal!",
