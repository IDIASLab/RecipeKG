I followed the suggestion of others who were short on marinading time by nicking the meat before marinading - half an hour does the trick.\n\nTo life the marinade further, I added a dash of sherry and a teaspoon of brown sugar.  \n\nBy the way, grill some mushrooms in the extra marinade - they are delicious this way.",

I should've known better...basically the type of teriyaki sauce you buy determines the taste of the meat b/c the garlic didn't help much (and I added extra). I used \"Famous Daves Teriyaki Sauce\" = I had never tried that brand before but I don't normally buy teriyaki sauce so I didn't know what's a good brand to use. Therefore I'm giving this 3 stars because it's easy and quick and it's not ALL the recipe's fault. If anyone knows a better teriyaki sauce I MAY try this again.",
