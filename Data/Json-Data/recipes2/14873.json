I opted to use the pizza crust and only one used about a cup and a half of ham and just eyed the brocoli cheese and mayo.Heated the mixture in microwave for about 3-5 min. stirring. Next time I would make even less filling (serving two people) and possibly try using velveeta the shredded cheese is much too greasy and made for soggy left-overs..Also I sprinkled the crust with Mrs.Dash seasoning mix after cutting strips which really boosted the flavor..Other than that very yummy..Good with chicken too!! And it really does look beautiful when golden brown.",

I also used 3/4 a tbsp of yellow mustard and 1/4 tbsp of dijon mustard and 4 oz of sour cream. I sauteed the onions in butter until soft and the broccoli I steamed for about three mins. I prepared the filling early in the day and put in the refrigerator until dinner time. I then took the filling and put into waxpaper rolled to a tight roll the size of the filling. Then I did an eggwash on the pastry and it turned out great. I will definately do this again and will also try with different veggies and meats.",
