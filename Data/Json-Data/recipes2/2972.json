I purchased stir-fry beef that was already sliced. I used a cast iron skillet adding the beef right when it reached smoking hot. We lined the pitas with hummus as suggested and our optional stuffings were: lettuce red onion cucumber (English/seedless/burpless) tomato (grape tomatoes) Greek olives (kalamata) and feta cheese. My son doesn't like pitas so he used a spinach wrap. All happy:) Note: I'll try adding roasted red bell pepper next time. I didn't have any on-hand.",
