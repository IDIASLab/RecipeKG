I made a couple of changes based on what I had available and food allergies. I used natural uncured turkey hot dogs, omitted the poblano and brown sugar, used chili sauce for ketchup, and regular yellow mustard for Dijon. This is a definite make again and will probably make it to the regular rotation. Anyone will like this that likes simple fare, hot dogs, soup, limited ingredients or a quick meal.

I used Boars Head hot dogs (figured if the main protein \"star\" of the dish was hot dog then I'd better use a good quality one!) and the only sub that I had to make was a bell and a cubanelle for the poblano.
