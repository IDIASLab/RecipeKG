I could also see this being eaten as a casserole with crushed tortilla chips on top served with additional toppings like tomatoes and sour cream. It was fairly easy to assemble and very good just as written. I just realized I used a larger 7 oz can of chilies and I thought that amount was perfect; the smaller can wouldn't have been quite enough for us.",
