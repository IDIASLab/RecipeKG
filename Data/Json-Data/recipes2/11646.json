Don't use shortening, so used 6 teaspoons of real Irish Butter.  And instead of molasses,  i added 1 TBLSP of organic brown sugar. Oh, and I didn't read until too late that I was supposed to separate the egg white and whip it.  Just put it in at one time.  So I really changed almost everything, due to not wanting to run out to the grocery store during this COVID-19 time.  but used it as a basis for proportions. Batter was still light and puffy.  It was yummy.",
