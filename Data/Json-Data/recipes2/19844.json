The cream cheese should be cubed or diced and stirred in along w fruit/nuts once mixture has been allowed to congeal slightly. It is nut \"fluffy\" but rather is a congealed salad w/ a tart taste. Also my recipe calls for these amts: 2 pkgs jello 1 can cherries 2 pkgs cream cheese 1 sm can pineapple 13 oz cola. heat juice from fruit to dissolve the jello add cola then refrigerate to congeal slightly ( about 1 hr). Gently stir in cubed cheese fruit & nuts and allow to congeal completely.",

I thought the cream cheese might give this a bit of a creamy texture and maybe alter the color a bit to pink. First you MUST allow the gelatin mixture to congeal slightly (takes about 1 to 1-1/4 hours) in the fridge. If you don't all of your fruit and nuts will sink to the bottom. Next it is IMPOSSIBLE to incorporate the cream cheese into the gelatin even if you ultimately use a mixer (I know because I finally tried that). What you end up with is red gelatin with tiny white flecks of cream cheese which isn't too attractive. IMO the cream cheese adds nothing to this recipe except calories. You simply can't taste it so why bother? The term \"fluffy\" should be removed from the recipe because you'll never reach a fluffy stage. I used sugar-free jello and it firmed up fine but you just don't have that beautiful clear jello appearance. It looks a little \"curdled\" for lack of a better expression. Tastes OK but sorry I'll stick with my old tried-and-true recipe.",
