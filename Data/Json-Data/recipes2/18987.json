But I used the recommended measure and spread it out in the pan.  I used a little lower heat to account for the thickness.  Although thick and clunky looking, they were moist and light to eat.  I cooked some frozen blueberries with spenda for a compote topping that was light in calories.  Fiber, Omega-3, Antioxidants...and flavor.  What more do you want for breakfast!",
