Doing that and finishing off under the broiler, would have probably been best.",

I did lightly coat the potatoes with olive oil and salt and then baked them at 350 for an hour instead of using the microwave and then I put them back in the oven long enough to melt the cheese for the \"twice baked\" step. If you are worried about them being salty, just add the ranch mix to taste. I also added some cooked, crumbled bacon along with the cheese before putting them back in the oven to melt the cheese. I will be making these again for sure!",
