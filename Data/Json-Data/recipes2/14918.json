I also add about 4 turns of my pepper and salt mills. To reduce onion smell/tears while I'm making this I put the cheese in a mixing bowl season it with salt and pepper and stir it up with my hands add the sour cream/mayo mixture and stir everything up well and THEN cut the onions and quickly fold them into the cheese/mayo/sour cream mixture. I also like the recipe as is and I am really thankful to adodd for posting it--so delicious! Great with bread crackers and even Doritoes. I simply can't imagine making this with anything but real mayo--I never touch lite or reduced fat mayo and I would certainly never make this with miracle whip because it seems like the flavor would be off. The sour cream reduces the greasiness without changing the flavor base. Thanks again!",
