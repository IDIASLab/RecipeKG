The bacon understandably makes these unbelievably flavorful. I included the bacon grease and still added some butter to boot! I've never made mashed potatoes with buttermilk before always wondering if they'd make the potatoes too sour/tangy. Not to worry - the buttermilk taste is subtle. I'll remember this when I have buttermilk to use up. I didn't serve the potatoes with extra buttermilk to dip them in because they accompanied meatloaf and gravy (and truthfully because dipping the potatoes in a side of buttermilk seemed a little odd to me). We loved this embellishment of traditional mashed potatoes to wake them up.",
