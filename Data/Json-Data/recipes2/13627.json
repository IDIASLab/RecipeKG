Chill them for about 30 minutes after you mix in the coconut, then chill them another 30 minutes after shaping them, chill them about 20 minutes after rolling them in cinnamon.\n\nI used 1/2 tbsp of cocoa with every 1 tbsp cinnamon for the coating. After letting it set for about 20 minutes, I brushed the excess off with a basting brush.. I HIGHLY reccomend doing that, otherwise the coating is overwhelming.\nIf you're not a cinnamon lover, I would suggest rolling them in just cocoa, I think I am going to try that next time.\nAs is, the cinnamon taste is WAY to strong, for kids, I would definitely try the cocoa route.

I used some butter to grease the palms of my hands for rolling and I place the mixture back in the fridge for a few minutes once it starts to get too sticky to roll cleanly.  We like the sharp contrast of the pure cinnamon coating with the creamy sweetness of the candy. A little powdered sugar mixed in with the cinnamon will reduce that sharpness, for those that don't. Prior reviews that have noted a \"too buttery\" taste must not have creamed the butter and cream cheese thoroughly.  I cream the two of them together in one of my large stainless mixing bowls using using the back of a large 13.5\" stock spoon until the color is uniform. I also combine the vanilla using this method.  An electric mixer is almost a required item to combine the powdered sugar, unless you are really up for a work out with you wire whip! Enjoy",

I had to explain what they were since they do look a little odd but once the group knew what they were they dove right in until they were gone. The taste is different and good and they are a great touch for St. Patrick's Day. I would recommend chilling the mixture for about five minutes before forming the potatoes then chilling them again for a few minutes before rolling them in the cinnamon. They keep their irregular potato shape better that way.",
