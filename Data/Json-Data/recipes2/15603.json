Not spicy but hotter than anything I've ever eaten before. Somehow it was hotter than pure tobasco sauce. I think it was the soaking. What I did was make sauce then fry chicken then I soaked the chicken in the sauce in the oven at 170 deg F. until I was done frying the chicken. It was so hot it hurt to use the bathroom afterwards. 5 stars for authentic taste but don't recommend soaking chicken in it. Use it sparingly or don't use as much tobasco sauce.",
