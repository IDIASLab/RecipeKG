Here are some of the changes I made:  I sauteed the bacon, onions and celery, and added the flour to the bacon fat to make the roux.  I love potatoes in my clam chowder so I diced up a couple pounds of potatoes and simmered them in a large stock pot of the clam juice and water.  After the potatoes were tender, I added to bacon/onion/celery roux and thickend the broth.  Then I added some milk and cream and the minced clams.  It was so simple and sooooo good!  This recipe is going in my book of keepers!",

I did added one more tbsp of flour and used 500ml of half and half and 500ml of milk. I also did not use clam juice as I did not have any. I cooked the chowder but left out the clams and let it simmer while I steam cooked the fresh clams with white wine and garlic butter. I added the 2 cups of stock from the steaming of the clams to the chowder and then just before serving the chowder added the chopped clams. I did not want the clams to over cook. It was just perfect this way. Our family likes a mild clam flavor and this chowder was perfect. All the flavors were a perfectly delicious combination. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!",
