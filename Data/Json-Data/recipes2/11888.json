I have never made meatballs with no salt or spices at all in the meat itself so I added half a tsp of dry mustard half a tsp of garlic powder and half a tsp of black pepper. I formed the meatballs using a quarter of a cup measuring cup so they were fairly large. The sauce is wonderful. It thickens as it cools and really sticks to the meatballs. Yum! I used a brand that is more mustard based (Cattleman's Gold). My only observation is that this makes an awful lot of sauce. I had at least a cup and a half after all the meatballs were gone. I'm going to use it to bake some chicken cause it's too good to waste. I also wish these were called by another name. Hamballs is somewhat misleading. Please list this recipe again just calling it BBQ meatballs so others can enjoy it like we did. I will be making again and again. Thanks so much for the great recipe.",
