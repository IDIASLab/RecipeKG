She boiled the pasta then placed it in a baking dish. Using the same pot from the pasta she made the Bechamel sauce in it. Rather than dirty another pot she heated the milk in the measuring cup in the microwave. She did add garlic and some pesto she found in the fridge to bump up the flavor along with crushed red pepper. The pasta baked very nicely and was cheesy but the main thought from everyone was they did not like the \"jarred sauce essence\" and were left wishing it had some ricotta mixed in. No one left the table hungry but we won't likely make again.",
