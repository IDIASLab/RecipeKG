I didn't have cornmeal so after marinating, I scooped up the chicken with a lot of the sauce still on it and just rolled it in italian flavored breadcrumbs with parmesan per the recipe. I made this for my Dad (I don't eat meat) and he loved it. The baking time was great too. Crunchy on the outside, fairly juicy on the inside (might check it a few minutes earlier next time though) and he said it had a wonderful flavor. Plus how easy can you get! Pour on dressing, let sit, roll in bread crumbs, bake. No brainer. My photo doesn't do it justice. This was a good one, and definitely a keeper. Thanks very much Bearandy!!",
