It is also lower in fats and sodium as the fried onion rings are replaced by whole wheat topper. It is also great for people on diabetic diets. You can substitute wheat bread crumbs for the panko bread crumbs, if desired.",

I was intrigued by this recipe using fresh ingredients and skim milk for a lighter sauce.   I was very pleased with the end result!   The green beans were not mushy and I loved using fresh vegetables in the casserole.  The use of the ranch dressing mix was also a nice addition of flavor and gave you the salt you needed without using excess sodium.   I loved the onions and garlic in the panko, but, I do think I would add some more seasonings to the crumbs or even used seasoned panko instead.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!",
