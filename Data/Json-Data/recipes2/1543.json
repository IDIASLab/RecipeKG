        "description": "This is a Swedish (Scandinavian) dessert that is traditionally served during the holidays, specifically at Christmas. But you can eat it whenever if you like, because it is just that good. Getting the rennet may be a bit difficult, but can be an adventure to acquire. If you're traditional serve with lingonberries. If you're not, raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries work just the same. You can even make a berry sauce to drip over it too and/or top it with whipped cream. You can also add a graham cracker crust to the bottom.",
