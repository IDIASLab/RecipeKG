I used lemon-pepper chicken because it had already been out on the counter to thaw for a half hr the occasional hint of lemon was refreshing! Instead of mixing the sauce with the pasta then adding the chicken mixture I added the sauce and tomatoes right to the chicken mix and let it simmer while the noodles were cooking. I also used a full jar of spaghetti sauce (essentially doubling what's listed) and added: 1 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes 1/2 tsp of oregano and about 1 of fresh frozen basil (we chop the leaves then freeze them in an ice cube tray) so for this dish I used one cube.",
