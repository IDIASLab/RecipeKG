It's not really all that hot and it really shouldn't be - that's not supposed to be the point.  This recipe is wonderful and right on as is, however, mixing in some fresh chopped parsley at the last adds freshness and color.  But certainly add the garlic, oil and crushed red pepper to suit your own tastebuds, as Im sure the submitter would agree.  Tonight, just for something a little different,  I made this in the style of Cacio e Pepe - add some of the reserved pasta cooking water to the cooked spaghetti, then mix in some grated Parmesan or Romano cheese - what you want to achieve is a creamy sauce. If it is too watery, add more cheese - if too dry, add more of that beautiful, starchy pasta cooking water.  Just another delicious way to eat basic pasta...",

I recommend substituting a fresh thinly-sliced red peperoncini (chili pepper) for the crushed red pepper; adding a few tablespoons of fresh finely-chopped flat-leaf parsley (also known as Italian parsley); using a good flavorful brand of olive oil; and using the best Parmigiano-Reggiano you can afford. Add the chili slices for the last minute or so to the hot garlic and oil and add the chopped parsley when tossing the oil and pasta together. --In the past I have had the opportunity to sample this dish made with dry ingredients. However preparing this dish with fresh ingredients makes it a stand-alone meal. All you need is a glass of Pinot Grigio and your favorite fresh bread. Mangiare bene!",

I let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes to really let the red pepper release it's heat and the garlic to become a little more fragrant. On low heat you shouldn't have any problems with the garlic burning. Be sure to use a very good extra virgin olive oil with a flavor that you love as the olive oil is your main element in this simple and delicious pasta. The garlic and red pepper simply add another level of yummy and the taste was perfect! Thank you for sharing this treat!:)",
