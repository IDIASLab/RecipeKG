I will try this dish again, but next time, I will use 6 oz of fontina cheese and 1/2 cup cream.  On a side note, try a bite before adding additional parmesan cheese on top!!",

I was a little short on fontina so I upped the parmesan to 1/4 cup. Sadly I had no fresh basil so I had to use dried. Still good though but I can't imagine how much better it would have been with fresh!",

That means cutting the butter amount in half, adding flour to make a roux, then adding the liquid, stirring until thickened and finally the cheese. In this case, I used fat free half and half and found I needed more than suggested. Fontina is one of my all time favorite cheeses, so I was thrilled to have a reason to buy it. I shredded it instead of cubing and probably used a bit more. I also added some seasonings to the sauce. This was a great start to a comforting and delicious dish. Thanks!",
