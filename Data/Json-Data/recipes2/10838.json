When I went to go assemble the salad I grabbed the romaine lettuce instead of the red leaf lettuce out of the fridge and well...there you have it. Hubs and I really enjoyed this salad so I think it is safe to say you can use whatever lettuce you prefer or have on hand and this will still come out good.",
