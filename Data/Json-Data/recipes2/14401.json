I'll maybe play around with this in the future.",

I had kielbasa sausage on hand and sliced that up and browned both sides then added 1/2 a sweet onion chopped and used fresh mushrooms (125g or about 1.5 cups chopped) and let it 'simmer' for about 5 minutes stirring frequently. Then I added the cooked rice blended it all together and let it 'simmer' covered for 5 more minutes. It turned out pretty good if still a little bland. I would make again with my modifications though.",
