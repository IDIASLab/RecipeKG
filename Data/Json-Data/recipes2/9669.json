I added about 1/2 cup of pistachios. It was delightful. Thank you for sharing this delicious quick recipe. Note for people you can sub the sweetened condensed milk for heavy cream if worried about sweetness. Forgot to take photo last night and it is already all gone. Beautiful light spring green color.",
