It s a souffle so be prepared to serve as soon as this comes out of the oven because it does deflate quickly; that doesn t affect flavor just presentation. The texture really was light just like a souffle is supposed to be. This was OK but flavor was a little on the weak side. If I make again I ll either go with more cayenne for a bit more of a zing or maybe head the other direction with a little sugar for additional sweetness. Either way needs salt & pepper IMO. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
