Put the tofu on one plate then put another plate on top of it w/something heavy like some books or a watermelon top of it, then just dump the extra water out.  I do it for an hour or so because I like the texture of the tofu to be dry! Great recipe!!! (not usually a tofu lover either!)",

I would recommend getting the firmest tofu you can and stir-frying it a few minutes before you add the garlic so it takes on a firmer more \"fried\" texture and is not too squishy. Also I found that after I cooked the frozen veggies I had quite a bit of liquid left over so I added some cornstarch water and let it set a few minutes after I turned off the heat. This made a delicious sauce when it thickened up a bit. I also used a little more oyster sauce.",
