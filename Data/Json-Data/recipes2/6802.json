I used fresh Roma tomatoes dried basil instead of fresh basil and only about 4 oz of shredded of Italian cheeses instead of 8 oz of pepper jack and mozzarella shredded cheeses. And used Panko breadcrumbs and added to Italian seasonings to it. I like the texture of Panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs. Did not try with the black olives or pepperoni as it was suggested by others. Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!",
