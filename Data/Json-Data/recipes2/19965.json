This recipe uses plain non-fat yogurt. Don't be scared to try it - you won't regret it! However we had to add a LOT more dill some more mustard lots of garlic powder salt and a little pepper to really flavor it up. And the longer you let it sit in the fridge before you eat it the better it tastes! I really can't say enough for this potato salad!",
