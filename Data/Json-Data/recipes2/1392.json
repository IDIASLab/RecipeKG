I followed the recipe to the tee the fresh sage is a must it just adds a subtle flavor that complements the sausage and Classico sauce very well! I can t wait to try this over pasta too!",

The next time I make this and I will for sure I will dilute the sauce a bit with milk to cut the saltiness. This is inherent in the sauce and no reflection of Duboo's recipe. Very rich and decadent comfort food. Thanks!",

She was in the mood for biscuits and gravy!  We are in the middle of a major deep freeze and nobody wanted to go out to get the Alfredo sauce and the refridgerated biscuits that the recipe called for from the store.  Lol!  We happened to have all the ingredients at home so we decided to make a homemade 4 cheese Alfredo sauce and homemade baking powder biscuits.  My daughter and I tag-teamed the meal preparation and dinner was on the table in an hour!  We paired it with a vegetable salad.  The whole family loved this meal...it was delicious!!!\nThanks for submitting this recipe.  It was a great lesson for my daughter to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d and come up with an alternative if all the ingredients were not readily available!  The joy of cooking with my daughter was priceless!!!",

First I had some leftover grilled pork chops and wanted to make a hot sandwich with them. I also had some of Chef John's Homemade Hamburger Buns in my freezer! So I cut the pork thin toasted the hamburger bun with butter made the sandwich and poured your sausage sauce over the top. The only thing I did different was to use thyme rather than sage (personal preference). It did take a little more sauce vs sausage than called for but it worked since we were not using the whole recipe. We very much enjoyed our sandwich tonight! Hubby thanks you too!",
