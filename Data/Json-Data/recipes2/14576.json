This is how I made it (the four stars are based on my version): I replaced the tuna with imitation crab (shredded). I used 1/2 the amount of Miracle Whip and replaced the 2nd half with Campbell's Condensed Cream of Shrimp soup. I added garlic powder onion powder oregano parsley basil and capers along with the remaining ingredients. I used the jumbo shells and stuffed the mixture into the cooked shells. I topped it off with a slice of avocado. They are them like a finger sandwich (don't overcook the pasta or it will be oozing all over the place). I made them for a baby shower and barely got then out the door because my family wouldn't stop eating them! The party guests really enjoyed them and I got requests to make it for the next pot luck at church and future bridal/baby showers (as I tend to be the party planner/ caterer for our church family and group of friends). I only got a nibble of one as someone took my plate but it was yummy creative and inventive. Thanks for the starter recipe!",
