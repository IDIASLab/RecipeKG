I made my own pickeled ginger using this recipe from the site Homemade Pickled Ginger (Gari). Didn't have Mirin so I used plum wine and it awas delish! Next time I will just speinkled the nuts on top to keep it even healthier. I thought it would make too much but my hubby and I split the whole batch and I wanted more! Will Definitely make again!",
