(I used to struggle mightily to hard-cook a decent egg.)  For those who are complaining about the yolks being undercooked, perhaps you are starting your 17-minute timing a bit prematurely.  One should wait until the eggs themselves start to \"dance\" on the bottom of the pan; this is the exact time to turn off the heat, cover, and set your timer for exactly 17 minutes.  Do not remove the saucepan from the burner; I believe the residual heat to be an essential part of completing the process correctly.  Oh, and following these directions explicitly has always produced eggs that are easy to peel... but only after complete cooling, and I never use fresh eggs... only those that have been in the fridge for at least a week.  (After cooling according to the directions posted in Chef John's recipe, I usually cool them in the fridge for at least an additional hour before peeling.)  I hope these suggestions are helpful to others.",

So disappointed, because that means I have five more failures in the fridge at home! UPDATE: The third time I made this recipe was a charm! Turned out, my eggs were not dancing violently enough before I turned off the heat per Chef John's suggestion in the video. One person's simmer is another person's boil, apparently. I suggest to others who had my same initial outcome (sad eggs) to try this recipe again and do not shut off the heat until you think you've reached a boil, as I bet we share the same misconception of what \"simmer\" means.

The only problem I have with it is not quite enough water and not a hard enough boil before removing from the heat source. The water should be an inch higher than the eggs in the pot, not just covering them and the water should be boiling violently. I can see why so many on here have had uncooked eggs and it's because there's not enough water to retain the heat properly. Also, the best trick I've ever gotten for peeling eggs came from my brother-in-law. If you use a small spoon (can't be too deep, the flatter the better) and after cooling the eggs and then smacking them all over to loosen the shell just peel a small part so you can insert the spoon under the membrane and gently turn the spoon and lift off the shell. Works perfectly everytime and I never have ugly eggs, no matter how fresh they are!",

                "reviewBody": "This was a fail for me.  My eggs turned out like soft-boiled eggs -- runny centers.  No way would they make deviled eggs!  I have a couple of thoughts:  One reviewer says \"I bet we share the same misconception of what \"simmer\" means\". Perhaps, but the video very clearly depicted a very mild simmer.  The eggs might have been just starting to \"dance\", but they were not \"violently dancing\" as another reviewer suggests they should.  The other comment that I think makes some sense is to not remove the pan from the burner because the residual heat helps to cook them.  That only works if you are using an electric cooktop. Gas cooktops don't retain enough heat. \n\nThis is similar to the technique I have used for years from my old Betty Crocker Cookbook which says to bring the eggs and cold water to a boil quickly and then cover and remove from heat.  Let them stand 22 to 24 minutes.  I tried Chef John's timing this time.  I won't be using it again.",
