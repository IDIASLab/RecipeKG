Only change to ingredients was that I swapped out 1/3 of the mild sausage with hot sausage and it was great. When I made it i had extra sausage mix and instead of cutting more peppers to fill I over filled the ones I did have. I don't recommend doing that because they became hard to handle while eating.",
