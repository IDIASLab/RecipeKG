But people seem to be critiquing the idea, rather than the specific flavours, so I'm going to break that rule.  I think this is wonderful.  You can't be expecting oatmeal with a different texture; you have to be expecting a totally different breakfast.  It probably also helps to like couscous -- a lot, which I do.  I would really recommend trying it, especially if you like hot cereal in the morning.\n\nvariations: I used chopped dried apples and walnuts and added them after about two minutes of the five, so that the apples reconstituted a little.  I poured a little maple syrup and vanilla soy milk (I made it with regular skim) over the top once it was cooked.",

If you find it too dry you can remedy this with an ancient method called adding more milk. Any time you cook with couscous don't be a slave to the recipe. Trust your intuition and if it's dry add liquid.",

The cinnamon also wasn't \"cooked\" enough to flavour the milk and there was a powdery taste in the dish. When I make this again I will simmer a cinnamon stick in milk and use a tad more honey than called for to get the flavour in.",

Here's how I make mine: at night I fix up a mug with 1/4 Cup Couscous some \"Bare Fruit\" organic bake-dried cinnamon apple chips (broken up) dried cherries cut into smaller pieces and chopped walnuts & cover with some plastic wrap. Then in the morning when I fix my tea I add 1/3 Cup boiling water recover w/the plastic wrap and let sit 5 minutes. Stir add a tsp. of sugar (I found that if I add the sugar in the beginning when it cooks the sweet gets lost and I have to add more) and some milk until it's nice & moist. The milk cools it down too much so a quick 15 - 20 seconds in the microwave heats it back up. Makes just the right amount for breakfast! I save the plastic and reuse it the next day.",
