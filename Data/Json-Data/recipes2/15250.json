You marinate water chestnuts in the terriyaki-type sauce then wrap in bacon and skewer with toothpicks to hold. Let the little bundles soak in the sauce for one hour then bake slowly on a foil-covered broiler pan or cookie rack till the bacon is cooked through (about 45 min at 350). Broil carefully for 5 minutes to caramelize and serve warm. These are the most requested dish she makes and please many more people than the traditional version.",
