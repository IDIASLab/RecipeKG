Ditched the Italian herbs parsley and the 1/2 cup of parmesan used to coat the pineapple and instead of those ingredients switched up the flavors with the following: Reduced the mozzarella to 3 oz and mixed in 3 oz smoked gouda and 3 oz of smoked cheddar with the mozzarella. Wasn't sure if you meant fresh or canned chopped jalapenos but since I had neither on hand used 1 cup (love extra heat - LOL) of jarred sliced jalapenos. Yummo!",

I did not measure the seasonings as I was making this on 1/2 a pizza...I simply brushed a bit of EVOO on the crust and sprinkled both the Italian seasoning and parsley over top (I was wary of the parsley and almost left it off but I'm glad I didn't; it works!). I used fresh pineapple and canned jalaps and added a bit of diced onion too which was a wonderful addition! I used mozzarella cheese as well as a bit of cheddar some grated fontinella and a bit of crumbled goat. I just realized when I came back to upload a photo and write this review I forgot to toss the pineapple chunks in parmesan; I WILL do this next time. And YES there most definately WILL be a next time. And a time after that. And a time after that....",
