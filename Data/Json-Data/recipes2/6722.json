I would make it a day ahead and let it sit in the fridge so all the flavors can meld together.  You should definitely try this!!  I had friends come over that immediately asked for the recipe.

I stuck to the recipe except for one addition. I added a couple sprigs of chopped cilantro and I think that added the perfect finishing touch. One mistake I made was in blanching the rhubarb too long. I lost more flavor than I intended. I also would add a second jalapeno next time. I added one per the recipe and couldn't get a lot from it... and that's something for me to say since I'm a wuss when things are too hot.",
