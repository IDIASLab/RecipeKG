This was one of those nights where we sort of just opened the fridge to see what we had and this is what we ended up with. You can adjust any ingredients to suit your tastes. I used another couple cloves of garlic because our household loves it. You could easily add chicken to this dish as well. Enjoy!",

Once you toss the drained pasta in there isn't enough heat left for it to \"steam\". I thought that step would soften the feta but it didn't. All it really did was start to overcook the spinach and you don't want to lose that bright green. Excellent recipe and it is has a lovely presentation which is always a plus.",

At 375 for 30 min I baked 1 lb chicken tenderloins covered in about three minced cloves of garlic; one can (drained) artichokes chopped; one box of organic diced tomatoes; about 1/4 cup chopped kalamata olives. While that was baking I cooked penne drained it and tossed it with 2 cups spinach. When chicken was done I mixed everything in a big pasta bowl adding feta cheese. Amazing!",
