I made a few changes though. Along with the peas, noodles, milk, and tuna fish, I used one can of celery soup and one can of mushroom soup (I can only handle so much of mushroom soup),  I also added 2 cups of cheese to the recipe and mixed it in. I chopped one large onion up and added it to the recipe and used Lawry's garlic salt and pepper to season it. I loaded the top with bread crumbs. It was fabulous. Now that I'm unemployed I will make this more often. Very economical meal! Great classic base recipe.",
