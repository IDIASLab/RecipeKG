These taste just like the inside of a peanut butter cup. In fact, I want to dip a few  into melted milk chocolate b/c I know it would be awesome! I can't believe that those two ingredients produced such a great fudge.  I will def be using this recipe again and again~YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Works great if you are vegan/have a milk allergy and nut allergies by using a jar of alternative \"butter\" like from soy nuts or sunflower seeds (I used Wow butter) and a dairy-free can of cream cheese frosting (I used a famous brand in the white can that starts with a \"P\").  Turned out great and helps me to not feel too left out during the holidays at the dessert table.  It is not meant to be a nutritious daily health food but an occasional much-needed treat.",
