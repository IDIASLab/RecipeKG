I used 1 1/2 shots Captain Morgan, to only 2 shots pineapple juice.  Then I mixed and poured over ice.  I added the cup of lemon/lime soda, and poured that in the glass.  Finally, I added a dash of grenadine, which sinks to the bottom and comes up creating a sort of \"sunset\" look.  As a matter of fact, we're calling these \"florida sunsets.\"  These had just the right amount of kick, but still went down smooth.",
