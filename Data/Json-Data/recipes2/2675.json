Couple of modifications I made included using a muffin pan instead of the cake pan because I found I didn't have enough crust to cover the cake pan. The muffin pan worked amazing and made perfect portions of this rich dessert. I also put the crust ingredients into a food process to give the crust an even spreadable consistency. My final tip is this has to be kept in the fridge. I live in FL so anytime I left them out they got too soft.",

                "reviewBody": "The flavors were rich and not bad but lacked depth. But my biggest reason for giving it this rating is that the portions are not correct. It says to put into a cake pan but at best this would be a 6\" cake pan not a standard size. Additionally or maybe because of the portion challenge when you go to spread the chocolate portion of the cake over the crust the crust simply spreads WITH the chocolate creating a big glump of stuff that doesn't resemble a cake at all. All in all these aspects made it very disappointing and we went out to buy something gluten-free and dairy-free instead.",
