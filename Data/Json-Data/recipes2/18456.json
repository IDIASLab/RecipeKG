And I thought it would taste great too-- until I got to the tablespoon of seasoned salt part. I hesitated and then put in two teaspoons of salt instead of the tablespoon. WHOA! Too much! I tried to compensate by doubling all the other ingredients in the dressing-- but it was too late. I ran out of mayo and sour cream and the salad looked more like soup by the time I finished. I do want to try this recipe again-- but next time I'll add the seasoned salt 1/2 teaspoon at a time until I find the right balance.",

Since I didn't have regular white vinegar I used a white wine vinegar. After tasting it I also added about a half a tablespoon of red pepper flakes to add a little zip as a foil to the sweetness.
