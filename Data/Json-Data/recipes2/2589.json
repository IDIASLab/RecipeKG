I was initially suspicious about the very short ingredient list but these came out so well! I ended up using all the buttermilk I had and all the self-rising flour I had which was not exactly in the same 2-1 ratio as the recipe but close enough. I had a TON of dough so I made larger farls and baked it (400 degrees on the lowest rack for 15-20 minutes) instead of using a skillet to cook. I also added raisins to half the dough which was super good! I am definitely keeping this recipe in my back pocket the next time I need to use up buttermilk!!",
