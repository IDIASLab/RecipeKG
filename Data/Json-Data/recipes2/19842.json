I double the recipe (as the frozen apple juice concentrate I use comes in a 12 oz. container), then add 1/2 to 1 cup of honey for extra sweetness. I also like to put in a Tbs or so of cinnamon for a richer flavor. You can even mix the taste and texture up by throwing in some sliced and peeled Macintosh apples (either cube before cooking or mash after cooking).",
