The time took longer for me because of the amount of shrimp I had to peel, but if you cut this recipe down, it won't take you so long. This time I also included crawfish. Oh ya'll gotta try it!

Nothing worse than bland seafood. Also didn't want to over cook them. As I said in cook's notes you could cook seperately but be sure to add good seasoning. I also prefer using as few pots as possible.",

The trick to this recipe is all of the herbs & spices, they really brighten the recipe.  I used Progesso\u00a9 brand  Lobster Sauce (3 12 oz cans) as seafood stock. And yes cook the seafood separately to keep from over-cooking it. Good Recipe!!",
