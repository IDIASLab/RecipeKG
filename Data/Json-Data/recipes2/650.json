I made this for a superbowl chili cookoff and I placed in the top 5 and my crockpot was empty within an hour! Will definitely do this again, soooo good.",

I let it cook for 15 mins instead of 30. No salt needed. This dish is really amazing the next day. WOW!  \n\nI was surprised to see Italian sausage instead of the traditional meat found in chili however this was a great mix of flavors and a hit at my house.  Another winner by Chef John. I am becoming a huge fan of his recipes. Thanks much!!!!",

Adapt seasonings and liquids to your own tastes.  I have this on the stove simmering now and the smell is nothing short of fantastic.  Again, it is Italian Chili. not Texas Chili, not Midwest Chili, nor Southwest.  Each are all different.  That is the best part - this offers you an alternative base and I highly recommended any of Chef John's recipes.  He is well trained and not simply a home cook, but he presents all recipes as easy to follow and just delicious.  Trust me - this smells like it is worth bursting your comfort bubble.  Delish!  And no - true Texas Chili has neither beans nor tomatoes.....",
