But since it\u2019s Christmas we gave it a pass. Anything that tasty has to be high in calories,right! \nI used fresh market brioche bread and leftover spiral sliced boneless ham from X-mass dinner. Along with the delicious cranberry relish from fresh market. \nTips: I put the finished sandwiches in a lg. lasagne dish on warm in the oven so I could serve them all at once. It is important to cook them on low so that the cheese melts and the bread does not burn. I used my LaCruset cast iron grill pan. \nSorry I forgot to take a picture.",
