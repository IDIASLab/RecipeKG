I did use equal amounts fresh sliced baby bella mushrooms. I made this casserole in my cast iron skillet. What I did was browned the onion with the mushrooms, red pepper and a little fresh minced garlic in the butter in the skillet, then added the flour and let the mixture turn a light brown before adding the broth, turkey meat and the remaining vegetables. Before sticking the casserole in the oven, I brushed each biscuit with butter. My casserole was done in a little over 20 minutes. The whole family liked it. This is really like a quick Turkey Pot Pie. I'd make this again. Very filling and comforting dish.",

The stuff I ended up with was thicker still than I would normally have made it and I just knew it was going to be awful! it turned out awesome! lol Just goes to show when a recipe is simple basic it can cover lil mistakes like that.

Whole dish was a dud.\" The best part of this recipe was that it didn't call for a can of cream of this-or-that but the end result was still really tame and could've greatly benefited from some herbs and/or seasoning. Also in 30 min. we had biscuits that were more than golden on the top (veering into overdone territory) but totally raw half-way down so when serving it we had to tug and flick away the uncooked biscuits which was very disappointing to the whole family.",
