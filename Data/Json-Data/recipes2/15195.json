Taking into account others comments, here's some clarification:  Use 1 teaspoon of tobasco sauce, as you never can tell how much 10 drops are.  Add a good dash or three of Old Bay Seasoning and about 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper.\r\n\r\nUse Fillo frozen fully cooked pastry shells.\r\n\r\nUsed hubby as a ginea pig last night and he ate a whole sheet of these yummy morsels!  Excellent with a nice chilled white to compliment the creamy seafood taste.  My next party will be a hit.  And you can easily keep the simple ingredients for this recipe on hand to whip up in a moments notice to wow drop-in visitors!",

I cut the layered sheet into 6 equal squares & tucked them into standard size muffin tins that I had sprayed w/ Pam. I had a bit of trouble getting the first one out but then I let the others cool a bit before giving them a twist & popping them out w/ the aid of a knife. For the cheese filling I did add Old Bay seasoning & additional hot sauce & worcestershire as well as some dried parsley & thyme. Instead of sprinkling the top w/ paprika after baking I sprinkled the top w/ dried parsley before baking. These were so good & so filling that my husband & I made our appetizer into our meal. All we did was add a salad.",
