Here are some things I did to make a super cute and easy watermelon: I used the largest of my Wonderlier Tupperware bowl set lined with plastic wrap and lined the inside with one pint of lime sherbet. I put about 1 1/2 cups of softened vanilla ice cream inside of the lime sherbet to make the watermelon more realistic. It started to get very soft, so I hardened it up in the freezer for about 10 minutes. When I pulled it back out, I could easily smooth the rind layer. I filled it up with the softened raspberry sherbet/chocolate chip mixture with only a tiny bit left over. Then I put the lid onto the Tupperware bowl and froze it overnight. It worked really well, and everyone loved it! The watermelon really looked realistic, and it tasted really yummy. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

The editor's tip about putting a warm towel on the bowl to help remove the sherbet only hastens the melting. Perhaps lining the bowl with plastic wrap would be a better idea.

Then I spread a layer of lime sherbet in the bowl froze spread a layer of lemon sorbet froze softened strawberry sorbet added the mini chips filled the center of the bowl with the sorbet chip mixture returned to the freezer until completely firm. Then I removed it from the bowl by slipping the bag off the bowl and lifting the \"watermelon\" out of the bowl. It brought back sweet memories and created some new ones.",
