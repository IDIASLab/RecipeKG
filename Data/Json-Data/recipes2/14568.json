I too added 2 TBLS softened butter used Miracle Whip instead of mayo and less garlic powder (apprx half). BUT I added in a pinch of crushed rosemary pinch of ground thyme and a dash of dried oregano. This really added depth to the bread and is on our top 10 list of favorite garlic breads. Great with pasta! Thanks Kendra!",

ON the bread I spread butter on both pieces and sprinkle that with garlic powder and then spread the mayo mixture over that. This gets broiled med to low for about 3-4 minutes (until cheese mixture is browned and bubbling). I have never made this recipe and not been asked for the recipe. It can be very rich but with pasta it is AWESOME!!!",

The Mayo is only to hold the ingredients together that is also why it is important to make sure it is a paste consistency. Add more or less garlic to taste I like lots. I get lots of requests and compliments on this garlic bread. It is awesome with a good lasgna.",
