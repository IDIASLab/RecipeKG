I also researched the nutrition info of each ingredient and there s definitely more substance and not just empty carbs to this. For instance each muffin will have about 3g of protein coz of the flour and eggs. Also more vitamin C and other vitamins than the usual muffin base. I followed the recipe exactly. I did alter the baking time. Recipe calls for 15 minutes at 350. I checked them at 12 and they were almost done then. Added 2 minutes and the muffins were a tad dry. I think they would ve been perfect at 13 minutes. So just check them earlier. It is summer so that probably affected baking time. Will definitely make again and use the base for other types of muffins.",

I didn't have applesauce, so I diced a cored apple with the skin & microwaved for 6 min. in a small microwave pot( I like chunky apple sauce) & added all to the other wet ingred. after it cools down.

I added in some flax meal in place of a little bit of the whole wheat flour; and also added a little cinnamon nutmeg and vanilla extract---just a personal preference flavor-wise. I also like that there isn't a super strong banana flavor; it's not overwhelming the blueberries at all. They're also quite moist for whole wheat muffins. The best part about these is that they taste great without any refined sugar. The directions are a touch confusing; as it states to preheat the oven to 325 cook the muffins for 6-7 minutes then reduce the heat to 350--not sure how that works? I just baked the muffins at 350 for about 22-25 minutes total and I got 15 regular sized muffins out of it. Will definitely make again! Thank you!",

I have tried various modifications for my own personal ease and ingredients on hand. I've used all sprouted whole wheat flour. The kids like mini muffins so I don't use/need baking powder. I've subbed buttermilk or plain yogurt w 1T of apple cider vinegar for the applesauce (to help leaven w the soda). I've upped the salt a bit. I also added one chopped apple last time and it didn't alter the baking time just made a few extra muffins. Kids liked the apple chunks. I've been baking at 350 for 10/12 min (mini muffins). Muffins stick to paper liners so I spray them w a bit of oil before filling. A lot of ingredients but nutritious and very customizable. Thanks for the recipe!",
