I use the ingredients listed (though I use iceberg lettuce not romaine) and I add half a bag of shredded salad carrots.

I then add salt and pepper and a small amount of mayonaise. (has to be mayo the real thing and not too much you want to coat it lightly). Go easy on the onions and chop the radishes nice and thin.
