As a few have pointed out the miso topping is too salty with just soy sauce and not the correct consistancy with one tablespoon of liquid. Yes will have to add water until the consistancy is gravy-like. I added pineapple teriyaki and sweetened lemon jucie to the topping. I think Ponzu (instead of soy sauce) teriyaki could get a similar effect. The miso adds a nice flavor but recipe needs to be fixed to add water to topping.",
