On this cold January day I didn't have much hope of having usable fresh herbs and thought I was going to have to improvise with dry but I was surprised that I was able to scrounge up some rosemary and thyme out of my ice and snow covered garden to give this a try.  A happy cook I was! De-boning the chicken was easy using my kitchen shears. I just followed along and cut as close to the bones/cartilage as possible, feeling my way through the thicker meat. Very easy to do and more cost effective than buying boneless in the store. I did substitute fresh lemon juice for the vinegar. I've tried vinegar in a similar recipe and didn't like the results. The lemon juice was a delicious addition. This chicken was done in no time at all and was tender, juicy and flavorful. This is a great method for a quick healthy chicken dinner.",

Accordingly, cooking time had to be increased.  I use a thermometer, not comfortable to go by 'looks'.   The method is fine, although - I suggest using a splatter guard or it will make a mess of your stove.  As for the sauce - for us it was too acidic.  1/4 cup of vinegar is quite a bit.  Next time,  I would use white wine and some lemon juice, instead of the vinegar, cook that down and then add the butter.",

Not dry at all, absolutely nice and plump and juicy. I seasoned with sea salt, pepper and some herbes de Provence while cooking. For my sauce, I used a good quality white wine vinegar and a bit of lemon juice which gave the sauce a nice bite but not bitter or sour at all, thanks to the butter. Served with some fluffy mashed potatoes and some steamed green beans. With butter on both, of course! :)\n\nThis will be a keeper for me because I am always looking for new ways to cook chicken breasts and I already have a few ideas in mind for different sauce combinations to try. An excellent recipe that I encourage any chicken lover to try.",
