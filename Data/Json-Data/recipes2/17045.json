I followed the recipe exactly but think it would have been better with the Swiss. Also I question why the cheese is shredded and mixed with the sauerkraut and dressing--seems like a lot of extra work. Even though this recipe omits the meat the procedure for making the sandwich could still be followed--put the dressing on the inside of the bread and then layer the cheese sauerkraut and tomato. I may try it that way using Swiss cheese.",

First of all I don't like rye bread I don't like sauerkraut and I'm not too much of a fan of 1000 island dressing but for some reason I was ecstatic to try these and as soon as I took the first bite I was sold. My review is just one in a long list of reviews that say essentially the same thing: These are amazing! Things we did differently: We did not shred the cheese but instead put it on top as you would with any other sandwich. We did not use the full 1/3 of a cup of dressing as the recipe for 2 sandwiches called for - instead we used slightly less. But seriously these were just so good! They are super fast to make and great for families that have people who are not all vegetarians. My husband was able to put meat on his while I ate mine as is. Can't say enough about these except that I plan on having them again. (and again and again...)",
