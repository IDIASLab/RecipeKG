Although we made with American cheese and jalapeno pepper-jack as directed, which is a very nice combo. I was amazed how the mayo gave an even browning with a nice crispy crunch without the greasy sogginess that butter can give. You don't taste mayonnaise at all and both my husband and I agree this was a very tasty grilled cheese. The other thing is the mayo didn't burn as fast as the butter does, so we were able to leave the bread on each side long enough for the cheese to melt inside. For us ease is another factor since we live in a hot climate we must store our butter in the fridge, so no more waiting for our butter to soften or brushing on melted butter. Give this one a try, you won't be disappointed, just use your favorite mayo.",

Made just as written except I used light mayo which I was unsure if it would brown properly but it was fine. The combination of cheese was wonderful and provided just the right amount of 'kick'. Using the mayo is a great idea and a great alternative to when you have no butter or it's too cold to spread. Thanks SHORECOOK for the delicious sanwich idea YUM!:)",
