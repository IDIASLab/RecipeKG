With that being said, I love me some celery in my potato soup and so I chopped up a stalk of fresh celery and threw that in the pot . I typically prefer fresh potatoes over frozen BUT this was so easy that I'm not going to complain. I think what I liked most about this recipe that sets it apart from most potato soups was the treatment of the bacon. Most recipes call for you to put it in the soup. I get it. I mean it adds flavor BUT it results in wobbly bacon and I hate wobbly bacon. If you are going to do that then use ham. Instead this recipe incorporated the drippings from the bacon so you got the flavor but then the bacon stays crispy as it should and gets put over the top. Coming from a soup lover and snob when it comes to the cream of soups, this is pretty darn good!",
