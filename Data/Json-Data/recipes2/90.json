What a great timesaving idea, thank you! I also tore my larger spinach leaves into about two or three pieces before putting them into the sauce so that once they cooked down, it was done. (I tore the leaves and removed any long stems the day before my dinner--a tedious and time consuming task depending on how much you're making!) I increased this recipe and used five 9-oz. bags of fresh spinach as a side dish for six people and there  was literally no leftovers.  Thanks so much for sharing this easy and delicious recipe!",

I wanted something to jazz it up, popped onto AllRecipes and found Steelhead Trout Bake with Dijon Mustard. After I mixed up the sauce and tasted it, I knew it would be delicious and so I decided I needed something to jazz up the plain salt-and-pepper, butter-and-vinegar spinach I had planned as a side dish. Once I had the steelhead in the oven, I found this recipe and slammed it together--didn't measure anything, just pan-roasted the spinach 'til cooked and dry, boiled down the cream, dumped in the spices. I think I got more onion and more nutmeg in than the recipe called for--and it was magnificent! WOW! We had a great meal of well-seasoned, delicious food. It was only after I came back to leave a review that I realized that there was supposed to be Parmigiano Reggiano in it too. Guess now I'll have to make it again! Thank you so much.
