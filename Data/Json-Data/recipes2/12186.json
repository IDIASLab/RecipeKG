It made the texture much better too in my opinion. I wasn't sure what this Kentucky bean was so I used an 18oz bag of pictsweet brand whole green beans. I didn't even bother to defrost them. I just did the water to about 1/2\" only to make up for the excess water of the frozen beans. For the bacon I only had pre-cooked bacon which is really thin. So I used 2 slices. It was perfect. I had finished the beans and realized I missed the clove of garlic. They didn't need them. I will definitely be making these again esp. with the calorie count. They were great with a seafood main dish. Thanks!",
