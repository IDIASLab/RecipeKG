I cooked this steak AND the sauce as shown in the video and recipe. This was such a complete success and the meat was unbelievably tender and tasteful. I m giddy with excitement as I will never use another cut of steak again except the butcher steak. IT was truly like eating an expensive cut but for 1.5 pounds it cost me 12 and the pieces were so big we are having the two leftover steaks tomorrow. This chef knows his food and I m so excited to have found him online!",
