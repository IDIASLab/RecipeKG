I subbed shallot for onion because I prefer the milder flavor, and I'm glad I did, because it was still a dominant flavor. I also used 2T olive oil and 2T water instead of the full 1/4 cup. The texture was like a thin mousse: fluffy, but loose enough to coat the salad nicely. I think you could add water until you get the desired thickness. I liked it better without the Parmesan. This was so easy and so yummy--a definite keeper!",

                "reviewBody": "The dressing was really good. The fresh herbs makes this. I wouldn't bother if I didn't have fresh herbs. Although I read the reviews and added more liquid ( grapefruit juice) to tarten it up as well as to thin it out. It made twice as much dressing as I needed perhaps with the additional liquid. The salad itself is a good platform to add to. For the future I will add mandarin orange and maybe mushroom slices. After allowing the dressing to blend it is not quite as oniony as it was when first made. I would NOT add more pieces of onion as the picture depicts. Although the color presentation is beautiful. I am a BIG onion lover so this is saying something. Maybe using shallots if you are just going to serve the dressing rapidly rather than in a few hours like I did. Also maybe croutons or something to add a little crunch would spiffy up the salad as well. Next time I will use love loaf with a smear of blue or Camembert cheese or crostini as accents Do NOT use the cheap Parmesan that is dry and grated from a green can... that will look terrible and lack flavor. Get a nice hunk of cheese and shave it don't grate it. Don't even shred it... Overall This is a recipe that will go into rotation with a few tweaks.. I will use it as a main course as suggested.",
