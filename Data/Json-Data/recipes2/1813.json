I didn't have any trouble with the bars falling apart. Here is what I did. I lined my pan with foil. When they came out of the oven I let sit for about 5 minutes then lifted them out of the pan using the foil. I sliced the bars immediately and gently pressed down and pressed the sides in so that they were compacted. I let cool then placed them in a container uncovered overnight. This morning they had a dense muffin texture and weren't crumbling. I do have to say they definitely DO NOT look like the Mott's/allrecipes photo. They don't have a granola bar texture at all. They are moist and dense. For the dried fruit I used a mix called New England Crunch made by Mariani. It is a mix of cranberries almonds and dried cinnamon apple bits. This recipe can easily be scaled down for 12 servings by using an 8 x 8\" pan. For the egg just mix the 1 egg with a fork measure it and use half.",

I am not sure what the texture of the bars are supposed to be but I was anticipating it to be more of chewy granola bar from the picture Allrecipes posted. The texture of my bars was very soft and more like a really soft cookie or cake. I cooked for 23 minutes until golden brown on top and let it cool in the pan completely. Personally I would much prefer the texture of a granola bar and not the cake like texture. The flavor is a four-five but the texture is a four for my family. 11/3/14 I have to amend my recipe from yesterday. I covered the bars with plastic wrap overnight and after sitting a day they will not stay together. Once you cut - it is very difficult to pick them up without them falling apart. I don't think I would make these again.",
