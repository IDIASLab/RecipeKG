I can't handle anything spicy, so to add some safe kick, I fried thinly sliced onions in the oil before adding the chicken in for its warmup. For the sauce, I used Sweet Baby Rays, and went with 2/3 honey BBQ and 1/2 regular (because too much regular is too spicy, sad but true). I used regular pre-shredded Mexican blend cheese, and followed the rest of the recipe. These were delicious and easy, and a great use for leftover rotisserie chicken.",
