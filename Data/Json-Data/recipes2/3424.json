Top secret means that he shared it with everyone the last 20 years, even my brother, who is no relation to Virgil, but he would never share with me until recently. I gave him so much grief about it that he finally shared it with me. I know what you're thinking, 'Virgil didn't share it with you because he didn't want it blabbed on the internet.' Nope. He only did that to pester me. This is a very good marinade that was developed by Virgil and his brother specifically for pork chops, but also works on beef and chicken.",

The marinade itself was delicious and imparted a deep, crusty brown color around the exterior of the chops, but I'm not sure that I like it quite as much as AR's \"Pretty Chicken Marinade\", which I also use on pork chops. But I'm glad that Virgil shared this b/c we still enjoyed it alot!",

Instead, it acts as a tenderizer.  The meat is perfectly infused with layers of delicious flavor; beyond juicy and melt-in-your-mouth tender.\nI made this as written and the only thing different from the original recipe was that I did not marinate the chops overnight (did not have enough time); they actually marinated about 5 hours.   Next time, I plan to give them more time to bask in this amazing marinade...\nThat said, they were STILL incredible!\nYou know how, when a meal is just really, really delicious and everyone is just basically SILENT through the entire meal; because to engage in conversation would be to interrupt \"The Savor\"? \nThat was us when we sat down to these amazing chops!  DEEEELISH!!!! The only sound was that of our silverware clinking! \nToday, I am trying the marinade with some steaks (also headed to the grill) and I will update my review after our meal.\nEnjoy with abandon, people!",
