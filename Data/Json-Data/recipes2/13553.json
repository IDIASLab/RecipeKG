I'm NOT a beginner cook and I've taken cake decorating classes before. The problem I had was w/ the frosting. It was the right consistency for a filling but not for piping work. I ended up using the frosting to fill my cupcakes but a different recipe to frost them. It's an amazing from scratch cake!",

I was so hesitant to make the beer infused frosting that I played it safe and didn't. (Besides I wanted a white frosting to show off the green and gold Packer colors for our big playoff game tonight!) But I will be the first to admit that this is so light chocolate that it would have been better with a rich chocolate frosting even if the one included in this recipe isn't used. Recipe notes: I did use Guiness ordinary table sugar rather than superfine which really isn't necessary and sour cream rather than the pricier creme fraiche.",
