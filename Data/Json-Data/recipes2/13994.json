I used 2 pkgs of frozen veggies instead of canned (thawed), one that had carrots, green beans, peas and corn and the other that had broccoli, celery and carrots. I used red onion, 1/2 cup miracle whip instead of 1 cup mayo (which added zip) and sharp cheddar cheese.  A hit with my family and this successful and easy dish will appear on my dinner table many meals to come. Thanks Linna!!",

I was disappointed in how bland it was-given all the rave reviews on this site.  So we changed it up for our dinner by these additions...started with 2 bags of frozen mixed veggies (different veggies in each-we did this the first around, too), a little minced garlic, a couple of shakes of Italian herbs, and a pkg. of Lipton Onion Soup mix (we had tried added the red onion in our first as suggested in another review-didn't quite do the trick for us). Rather than topping it with crumbled Ritz (as we'd done the first time) we covered it with Progresso Panko style bread crumbs (which also had an Italian flavor).  Everyone loved it. We will make our version again.",

I gave this four stars b/c I made a few changes - that were well worth it. For my veggies I used two cans of green beans, one can of creamed corn, a can of mushrooms, one cup of frozen peas and carrots (one cup total - not a cup of each), and the chopped onion.  I sauteed the chopped onion, peas, carrots and mushrooms in 3T of margarine.  In a large mixing bowl I mixed together the sauteed veggies and the other veggies.  To this I added 3/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup of mayo and one can of cream of mushroom soup.  Then I added 3/4 cup of seasoned bread crumbs to the veggie/soup mix.  And I followed the recipe for the topping.  All in all, I think I used this recipe more as a base.  However, the casserole is DELICIOUS now!  Sorry for the long review.",
