The only reason for four stars rather than five was that the recipe was not complete and I had to watch the video to do it correctly. It is clear in the video that either herbs or pepper are added to the chicken when it is browned and that herbs are also sprinkled over the cheese at the end. I also made the following changes to it: I only had chicken leg quarters so I braised them with the herbs and mushrooms first (figured it would take too long to bake!) and then removed the meat from the bones chopped the meat and mixed it in to the other ingredients. I only did this because it had to work for my 3 year old who isn't into chicken by itself. I cooked fresh tomatoes with the vegetables instead of using canned and used half a jar of spaghetti sauce since that was what I had. I only had to bake it for 5-6 minutes because all the ingredients were still warm and I just needed to melt the cheese. It was a great base recipe and I hope those that submitted it will correct the mistakes so more can enjoy it! As for me I'm looking forward to using this recipe many times over when our summer garden vegetables are here!",

I followed the recommendations of many of the cooks & added a good wallop of seasonings. I ground my favs in my mortar with 1 chicken bouillon cube. I cooked off the seasoned chicken breast tenderloins in the butter I sauteed my garlic & onions in- then tossed all the chopped veggies in the pan and remembered to pull the chicken off the bottom up to the top at the last minute. The chicken was nearly done at this point- I then put the dutch oven in the heated oven & cooked for 20 minutes stirred- added the cheese & returned it to the oven til the cheese was melted & looked right. I let this rest for 5 minutes before serving. I Do Suggest serving with a loaf of crusty bread to sop all the wonderful broth you will have. I tried to serve sour dough- but the flavors clashed.",
