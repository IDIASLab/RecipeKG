After reading previous reviews I decided to tweak it a bit: 1) I added some poultry seasoning for more depth. 2) I used two packages of powdered turkey gravy blended with water (jarred gravy is e-x-p-e-n-s-i-v-e. It thickened up just fine. 3) I made and cooked the base the night before reheated it on the stove while I made the stuffing. The base seemed a bit dry I added more water. 4) Since I used a cast iron Dutch oven I put the whole shebang in the oven. ONE IMPORTANT NOTE: There's no way this recipe serves four unless they're starving athletes. It served eight people just fine. I plan on trying this recipe again with real Thanksgiving leftovers; especially the gravy. The stuffing mix with soup and cheese was amazing! Thanks Jenni:o)",
