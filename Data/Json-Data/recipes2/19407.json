I used a homemade sourdough bread- no artisan breads here and also grape tomatoes cannellini beans feta orange and yellow peppers( left out the red & green peppers)and also added some summer sausage cut in quarters. I also sprinkled the feta cheese on top to give it a better visual presentation. The judges must have loved it- 25% judging for presentation and 75% for taste! I also added some rosemary and basil springs along side the platter I put it on. Thanks again for this great recipe!",

I liked the idea of using pesto and balsamic vinegar as the dressing but I had none prepared so I basically just made a vinaigrette with the same ingredients (basil garlic oil etc - no pine nuts though). I mixed the vegetable ingredients then rubbed the toasted bread with garlic before chopping and adding to the salad just before serving as I like it slightly warm but not hard like croutons. The goat cheese was and excellent addition and the chickpeas made this a very satisfying salad.",
