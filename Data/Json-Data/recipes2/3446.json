Also I halved the recipe since there are only two of us and still had some left over. Using 1/4 cup of each type of bean you have to keep an eye on it as I had to add more liquid to it twice. I'm sure I'll be making this during the fall and winter. A very good recipe. Thanks Swanson!",

The second time I made it I had about an hour before my wife got home from work (yes I work too lol) and I wanted dinner to be ready. To save time I used canned versions of all of the beans. You really don't lose any flavor at all doing this. Be aware though that you don't need nearly as much broth if you use canned beans. Next I substituted the tomatoes in the recipe for 2 cans of diced fire-roasted tomatoes. The first time I made this those things were hard to find kind of a hassle to use with the oil and trying to slice them etc. And I never used them again. The fire-roasted tomatoes added a nice flavor and really beefed up that \"stew-like\" consistency. Also the second time I left out the celery. But since pepper was the only seasoning the dish called for I found myself wanting more flavor. So I started shaking in all kinds of stuff; onion powder garlic flakes a dash of cumin. I even put a couple of shakes of some left-over BBQ rub in there. It was awesome. But make no mistake the original recipe is what gets my 5 star rating. So easy and so flexible. Great for \"keep it simple\" cooks like me.",
