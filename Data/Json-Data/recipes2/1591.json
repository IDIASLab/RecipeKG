I also made this grilled sprinkling a little cinnamon sugar on the outside of the sandwich after buttering it. My favorite was open-faced on toast again with cinnamon sugar sprinkled on top. Num!",

I liked this but didn't think it was quite what I was hoping for (maybe my bread wasn't fresh enough or my peach sweet enough). I thought I'd try adding a little butter or a little honey to the bread and then heating up the sandwich. I will try this again because I love the combination of these food items. Thanks Alyson!",
