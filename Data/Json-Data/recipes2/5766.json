        "description": "I started experimenting with making my own granola bars because the store-bought bars were too sugary. I wanted a mildly sweet, vegan, chewy granola bar that doesn't crumble and this is it! As you can see, the ingredients are flexible to adapt to your taste, and as long as you don't exceed the amounts and press the mixture well into the pan, you'll have a yummy snack that doesn't fall apart! The sweetness comes from the dried fruit and brown rice syrup, which makes this recipe unique among others that use additional brown or white sugar and butter.",

I also didn\u2019t have brown rice syrup, so I used honey instead. The only dried fruit I had were raisins, and those complimented the other ingredients nicely. The recipe came together easily and the kids have enjoyed snacking on them in the afternoons. The bars aren\u2019t crumbly and hold together well. I like the flexibility of the recipe in that different nut/seed /fruit combinations can be used and the bars should still turn out well. I\u2019ll definitely use this recipe again and will experiment with different ingredients.",
