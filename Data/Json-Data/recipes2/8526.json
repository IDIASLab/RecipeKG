                "reviewBody": "The flavor of these muffins is good but there were some problems. (1) Needs more sweet potato.  I used a 4.8 oz. sweet potato and my muffins were dry and dense.  It is better to write a recipe which states the quantity of mashed sweet potato measured in cups.  (2) I only got 11 muffins filling the pan half full.  Again more sweet potato may fix this problem.  (3) The streusel fell off my muffins when I took them out of the pan.  I will lightly press them into the batter next time, as well as add a little flour for a more classic streusel texture.  (4) As a personal preference, the nutmeg was a little stronger than I prefer.  Next time I will reduce nutmeg to 1/4 tsp.",
