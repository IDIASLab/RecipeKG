I now use the Magic Bullet. Unfortunately I went through 8 blenders/food processors b/c the motor burns out after running for a given amt of time. So cannot let it run long enough to turn peanuts into smooth PB. I still use this recipe on a weekly basis (im a huge PB fan) and stand by it. I now use 1 jar Planters Honey Rst and 1 jar of Planters 5 Alarm (spicy) and everyone still loves it. Does anyone have a recommendation for an affordable food processor (Vitamix is out of my price range and too big) whose motor will not burn out after 2 or 3 min of use? Also like compact appliances b/c live in apt w/ limited counter space.",
