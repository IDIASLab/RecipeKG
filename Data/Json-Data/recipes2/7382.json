I would absolutely suggest using the garlic powder. And next time I'll add bacon bits too.",

The flavor is reminiscent of a cheddar biscuit and this is far easier to make. I don\u2019t feel this recipe can allow for substitutions and be as enjoyable. It\u2019s light, flaky, buttery, cheesy, and the garlic and onion are a soft, smooth flavor addition to every bite. I made this recipe exactly as written. I used Sharp Cheddar cheese and fresh green onion. What might cause a dissatisfying outcome on this recipe would be substituting ingredients. An example of this would be skipping buttering or substituting mild cheese because it\u2019s just what you have on hand. If that\u2019s all you have and you still want to make this recipe, I would recommend adding a Parmesan or another cheese with stronger flavor along with your mild cheddar. I think butter substitutes might work fine in this recipe but I have not tried it so I cannot recommend. I look forward to serving this as a finger food to football games (Roll Tide!) and holiday gatherings. Quick and easy recipes that are cheap to make and this flavorful are hard to come by. Thank you so very much for this recipe, I will use it often!",
