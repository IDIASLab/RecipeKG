I equated this recipe to somebody telling me to make a tuna fish sandwich by opening the can of tuna mixing it w/ just mayo and slapping it b/t bread. Sure it's a starting point but the only way to take this recipe from yawn to yum is by tweaking it a bit. That being said I did the chicken FIRST then added the onions and peppers and began jabbing at the chicken w/ my spatula to break it into smaller and smaller pieces. I then added 3 TB of \"Taco Seasoning I\" recipe from here along w/ 3/4 c. H20 boiled then simmered until the liquid was absorbed. Served them w/ green onion cilantro tomatoes and salsa and then the recipe was scrumptious. I hate to leave a bad review but the recipe just needs to major spicin' up.",
