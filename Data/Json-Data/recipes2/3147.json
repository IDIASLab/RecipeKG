I used avocado oil in place of the milk, added dry cilantro, basil, garlic powder, smoked paprika and of course some salt. The only bread crumbs I had were panko which worked but didn't stick well because they were too chunky. I just bought some seasoned bread crumbs to make more since these were gone in minutes...took them to a picnic and everyone that tried one had to have more, really yummy.",

My three year old who hates veggies gobbled these up and asked for more \"cookies.\"  I found even using two zucchinis this recipe made enough breading for more like 4 or 5.  Maybe mine were really small?  I also found the breading didn't stick.  I piled some on top though and that stuck after baking.  I did use whole milk (all I had) and panko crumbs and grated rather than shredded cheese maybe that is why (what I had).  Also I think the pepper was a little too strong/much but that the only thing I would change.",
