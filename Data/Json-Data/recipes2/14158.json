I prepared this using 10 chicken legs, which I first seasoned with Fiesta brand Chicken Rub (available in Texas).  Because of cross-contamination concerns with the raw chicken, I changed the method of preparation.  In a shallow bowl, I mixed the 1 cup of dry bread crumbs, the \u00bd tsp of onion powder, and the 1 tsp of dried parsley.  In a separate bowl, I added \u00bd can of the mushroom soup only.  I rolled my seasoned chicken into the mushroom soup then rolled into the dry crumb mix. This allowed the crumb mixture to adhere to the chicken resulting in a delicious crust.  I drizzled with the 2 TBLs of melted butter, and baked as instructed.  I used the other \u00bd can of the mushroom soup and a \u00bd can of milk to make gravy, which we served over white rice.  My husband loved this meal!  Thank you Doris!",

I trimmed the fat off the chicken thighs (which I think are better than chicken breast b/c the bone holds in all the flavor).  In a separate bowl I mixed a packet of onion soup mix and a 3/4c breadcrumbs. Dipped the thighs in the soup mix then rolled it in the dry mix.  I placed them on a wire rack over a pan and sprayed it with spray butter.  Cooked it at 375 for 45 mins.  Was cooked perfectly.  I took the remaining soup, whisked in a cup of milk (added more garlic salt to taste), and about 2 tsp of cornstarch.  I did everything to taste/look.  I cooked rice and some steamed asparagus with it.  Great meal no leftovers!",

I recommend removing the skin from the thighs as the crumbs will stick better. I used reduced fat cream of mushroom soup and 8 oz of skim milk for a light version. I also recommend Italian seasoned bread crumbs for extra flavor. This is a nice dish served with flavored couscous and pinto beans. I highly recommend.",
