Allow plenty of time for prep, if you don't have the roast butterflied for you.  Also,  The stuffing is actually double the amount that can be stuffed inside.  Perhaps you could add it to the roasting pan about halfway through the suggested time.  If you don't cut the stuffing ingredients in half, it would be best to use a dutch oven to prepare the stuffing.  I had a hard time combining all the ingredients in my 12 inch skillet.  My roast had a  fat cap, and I roasted fat cap up, so it browned nicely.  I wondered about the lack of salt in the stuffing, since I used the Swanson salt-free chicken broth, but the bread crumbs had plenty of salt for the recipe.  Cooking and prep times are fairly accurate, but be sure to let the roast rest a bit before slicing.  This would be a lovely fall dinner with some baked sweet potatoes and a simple green salad.",

I used a sweet Onion instead of green onion and fresh fresh baby Bella mushrooms. I used Stove Top chicken flavored stuffing which was savory when you added the other ingredients and Herbs de Provence instead of parsley. I also did put Kosher Salt as well as the garlic powder and pepper on the outside of the loin once it was stuffed. I d never butterflied a loin but watched a YouTube video and made it happen. The results were delicious. Hubby approved.",
