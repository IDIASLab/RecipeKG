I did use fresh brussel sprouts instead of frozen, so that may have made a difference.  I found the cooking time indicated (10 minutes) to be WAY too short for my taste. Even at 20 minutes of roasting, they were still not cooked to my taste.  I will try it again - possibly using frozen sprouts, or soaking or microwaving fresh to improve cooking time and flavor.  My old stand-by method - \"steam-roasting\" in the oven (adding a couple tablespoons of water and covering) first for 15 minutes and then roasting on the top shelf of the oven is still the best, though, in my opinion.",
