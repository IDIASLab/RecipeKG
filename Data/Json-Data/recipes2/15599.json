Like another reviewer I substited a good zesty seafood cocktail sauce and substited garlic & chive-flavored cream cheese for more flavor. Other changes that made it AWESOME: sweet peppers (yellow red and orange) instead of the green. 2 cups of rip tomato instead of 1. I also added black pepper Vege-Sal crushed red pepper paprika garlic power and 2 cloves of garlic. By making those changes it was spicy with garlic and had a great smoked taste. It may be too spicy for some but we like heat.",
