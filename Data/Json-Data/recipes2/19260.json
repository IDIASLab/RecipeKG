Rice wrappers are thin clear and feel just like a dry noodle. In fact the asian store I went to stocked the wrappers in the noodle aisle. You just have to moisten the wrapper in hot water for a second or two NOT 20. It will feel hard but by the time you layer the ingredients it will have softened. Great recipe!",
