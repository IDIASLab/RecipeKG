I guess you can use any amount of pepper depending on how spicy you want them! I don't use a jar - I just dump the crackers in a large mixing bowl and pour the dressing over the top and stir gently every 15 minutes with a large nylon mixing spoon for about an hour until all the oil is absorbed. Store in Ziplock bags. We call them 'Hot Crackers' ('Firecrackers' at 4th of July) - they are awesome and people always ask for the recipe! You definitely can't eat just one! They also make great gifts in a pretty bag tied with raffia and dried red peppers and the recipe attached.",

I definitely had my doubts but because I was so intrigued by this recipe I just had to give it a try. Although the recipe states that the crackers would be crispy I really thought that they would be quite soggy due to the oil. Man was I ever wrong! Didn't have any dry ranch dressing mix on hand so I used an Italian blend. And it's true the longer they sit the better they get. So yummy Yvette and no I couldn't eat just one!!!!!!! Thanks so much!!!!",

If you do use the Chex cereal you need to cut the oil back to about 1/4 cup or it just lays in the bottom of the container and is a greasy mess. This is a tasty and easy recipe and I make about 3 versions of it a week! My kids like it better than any other chips I might buy! Yeah - it is that good! I get more fiber in them too by using the whole grain Chex cereals BONUS there! Loose the fat and calories up your fiber and try the Chex whole grains with 1/4 cup of EVOO or canola. Add half of that to your cereal and blend well. Add more if you need to but a little at a time. Once coated- add your dry ingredients. Love this stuff!!!",
