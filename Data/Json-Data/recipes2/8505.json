I wanted to make something fancier so to speak. This stuffing is amazing and it s not difficult to make! The fact that it cooks in the crockpot was very helpful on Thanksgiving Day too. I bought a baguette the day before cubed the bread and toasted it under the broiler leaving it in a ziplock bag overnight as a prep step the day before. This is a point at which I should have seasoned the croutons though. The apples: To peel or not to peel? I peeled 1/2 and left 1/2. Since the cooktime is long I didn t notice any difference between the two. I ll definitely fine-tune this next time I make it!",
