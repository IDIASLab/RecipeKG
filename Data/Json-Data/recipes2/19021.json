Only spread the jam/cream cheese to about a full inch before the edges. I cook mine in my quesadilla maker, and as long as I do this and only cook them for 5 minutes, I never have a mess. A great snack. Doesnt really need the extra sugar, IMO, better without. :) Probably best to let cool a minute or two before cutting up/eating, too. Hot jam will burn your tounge!",
