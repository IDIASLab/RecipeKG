I do keep tradition by substituting canned fried onions for fresh and for the bread crumbs as topping.  Sprinkle them on top with about 10 minutes cooking time left to crisp them up a bit.  Also, I add some soy sauce as the original recipe called for.  This recipe is basically just a starting guideline.  You can vary the amount of mushrooms, beans, soup or onions by eyeballing it.  You'd be hard pressed to ruin this.",
