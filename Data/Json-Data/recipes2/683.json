I didn't use a mortar and pestle for making the butter but I'm ordering one because I can only imagine that it'll make the filling taste even better.

I do have to admit I did change 1 thing I ground up my chicken in my food processor. When ever I pound out chicken breasts and try to fill them I always lose the filling no matter what I do. Ground chicken was much easy to work with. The only bad thing was that the meat was sticky so I was wetting my hands a lot. The taste was exquisite the absolute best I have ever had. The butter garlic and parsley combo is perfect and the pinch of cayenne just brings it over the top. I didn't think the prep was really that bad I think it was well worth it!!! Thanks Chef John:)",
