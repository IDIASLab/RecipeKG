I was sure it came from this site but I didn't save it in my recipe box and when I searched on pork tenderloin it didn't come up. Happily today I found a PAPER copy of this recipe and remembered that YES! I did make an incredible pork tenderloin recently and this is it!!!! Absolutely fantastic. I have now saved it to my recipe box needless to say. I substituted goat cheese for the gorgonzola because I prefer it and it turned out just fabulous. Thanks for the very memorable recipe.",

I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch and water because I thought it was quite thin. And I used feta rather than the gorgonzola. The major change I made was in the plating of this dish. I spooned a pool of sauce on the plate topped it with the pork chops (which Hubs had grilled) and then piled on the pepper/shallot mixture. Sprinkled the top with feta and it was GORGEOUS as well as DELICIOUS! The only change I would make next time is to cut back on the jelly it was just a little too sweet for us but that s just a personal preference. One word of caution the heat in this recipe will be determined by the pepper jelly you use. Some are a lot hotter than others.",
