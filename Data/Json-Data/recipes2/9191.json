You do need the full 18 hours for the gluten to develop since you are not kneading the dough, so plan accordingly.",

Plus grated asiago. \n\nAn added benefit is that other no-knead boules use pre-heated cast iron pots that make it  treacherous to handle without fingers being burned. \n\nOne note about the yeast. If you are concerned the yeast is no longer active, most will proof first. But these types of recipes with just a little yeast do not work that way. So, a way to test the yeast is to put the amount of yeast called for into a juice glass with a few ounces of warm water (110c) and a little sugar. Let it rest for 10 minutes and check. If good then just dump it into the bowl with the rest of the water and the other stuff",
