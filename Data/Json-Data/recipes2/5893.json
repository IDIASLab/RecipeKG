I did a couple things differently though. I didn't have fresh garlic so I used a tablespoon of powdered garlic. I used olive oil instead of canola. I used a medium/small tomatoe and 1/4 of a large white onion both diced very fine.  Also the cooking is where I differed a lot. I put my chicken in a glass casserole dish and baked chicken in preheated oven at 375 until done(about 20 mins). Then when I pulled out the chicken I braised it on a medium high skillet covered in butter on both sides of chicken until the where dark golden brown spots on both sides. This was my version of grilling. The chicken was so tender and juicy with a nice seared outside. I also tried this recipe 2x and used twould different shredded chesses. The first time I used and Italian blend and it was great. The second time I used shredded parmigian and my husband said he liked that more. They both were good in my opinion I guess it comes down to preference. Also the absolute thing that makes this recipe is the actual bruschetta!!! It balances everything out so well!  I'm getting hungry writing this review it was so good.  We served with a creamy pesto pasta which was perfect!",

Also, because I used frozen tomatoes from my garden instead of fresh (currently out of season), I decided to cook the bruschetta topping in the pan with the chicken. I used dried basil rather than fresh because I had it on hand. I also used fresh mozarella cheese instead of the bagged, shredded. It was delicious and flavorful.",
