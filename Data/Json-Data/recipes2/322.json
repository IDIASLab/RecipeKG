I served this with both a mustard flavored sauce and a strawberry sauce.  Enjoyed these as dipping finger foods.  :)",

I used a large frying pan with about 1/3 inch of oil for frying.  I just flipped the pieces over with tongs. I also used my fingers to drip additional batter on top of the pieces as they cooked, which gave lots of crispy edges.  In Japan I once had chunks of corn in batter and sine I had a left over piece of corn on the cob, I decided to try it too.   It came of the cob in chunks so I dipped them in the batter first.  I had lots of niblets that fell apart so I added them to the batter, then scooped them out with a slotted spoon, draining well. I fried them as small pancakes.",
