It was extremely greasy way too much butter and it was just flat out ugly once it was turned out onto a dish. I picked off a piece and it was hard on the outside but swimming in greasy butter if that makes any since. I ate like 2 pieces just to make sure I didn't like it and ended up with stomach cramps all night. Sorry I didn't care for this one at all and will never make it again.",
