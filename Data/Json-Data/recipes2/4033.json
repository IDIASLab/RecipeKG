Added nutmeg and clove spices each 1/2 tsp. to spice mixture which is what I use normally for gingerbread recipes. I will try doubling some of the spices next batch for I like baked gingerbread goods with a spicy bite. Otherwise perfect recipe as a base to make whatever you desire like the stuff mentioned in this recipe.",
