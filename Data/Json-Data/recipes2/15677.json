When the onion was softened, I added some minced garlic, which I briefly sauteed, before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also diced the carrot instaed of shredding it & used only 1/4 tsp. thyme, due to family preference.  I added all the broth at the same time & didn't bother blending the ingredients at the end.  A little texture from the lentils & veggies was fine with us.  I would suggest that if you go to the trouble of making this that you double the recipe so you can take some to lunch or freeze it for another time.",

I also sauteed the celery 'til it was soft to make sure I could puree it enough to sneak it past my kids.  Any crunchy bits, no matter how small, could give away my secret plan to get veggies into their bodies.\r\n\r\nI really like it.   I don't use thyme much in cooking and was not going to bother buying more when I ran out but I used the rest for this soup and thyme is already on my grocery list.
