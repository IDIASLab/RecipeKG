I made this and a fresh loaf of Italian bread and it was great for a small gathering of Moms that I had over my house. I added curry powder to the mayonaise/sour cream mixture and it was great. I also only added enough dressing to coat the pasta and eveyrthing else. I reserved the rest in case the salad dried out while it was in the refridgerator. It never did so I actually think next time I will cut the mayo mixture down. I used canneloni pasta because it is more elegant. Overall this was very tasty.",

I followed the recipe exactly with two minor exceptions - I did not have celery root so I used a sprinkle of celery seed instead. and I used cavatappi pasta in place of the mostaccioli because I thought the double elbows make a prettier salad. It goes together so easily. We had the romaine lettuce on the side as a separate salad. A very refreshing summer dish and a great way to use leftover turkey! Thank you for sharing.",
