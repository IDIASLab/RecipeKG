I made exactly as the recipe says and it tasted just as I thought it would too much curry. With this said I would like to add it is definatly worth trying but next time I make it I will cut back on the curry to 1/4 tsp. I put some on garlic flatbread with turkey lettuce tomato and sprouts which helped the curry taste. thank you so much for a light and refreshing summertime treat.",
