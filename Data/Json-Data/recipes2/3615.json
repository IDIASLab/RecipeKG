I also subbed mozzarella cheese so I didn't have to run to the store. Still always good and not as complicated as it looks",

The spice blend that you bake the chicken and potatoes with is very flavorful. I will use that for other dishes maybe on fish. The spices added to the hollandaise are also a must-do. The basil really makes it great. I will also use that hollandaise in other dishes. Thank you for a great recipe!",

But make the sauce while the chicken cooks. It took me 2 hours to make this. I did cut up the krab and got everything else ready while the chicken cooked but waited to make the sauce like the recipe says. Hadn't used this sauce before so didn't realize how long it would take to get done. But the results were worth it.",
