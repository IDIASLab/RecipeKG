I usually have to use canned oysters in this as we do not get fresh oysters in our area very often. I do not use 2 pkg. of sausage as that is too much for us but otherwise, I do follow the recipe. If using unseasoned bread crumbs, I add 1 teaspoon of sage OR poultry seasoning. If I have fresh sage I use a tablespoon of diced fresh sage instead of dry. When making dressing I make an oyster dressing and also a plain dressing without the oysters for those that do not like oysters. You can use the same recipe and leave out the oysters. Very good stuffing.",
