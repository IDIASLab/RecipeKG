Next time I make I'm going to use 24 oz. Frozen lemonade and only 12 oz frozen OJ. I like the lemon flavor better than the orange. We drank this with Diet 7-Up and it was great for a hot day!",

We've used blackberry brandy when we couldn't find cherry brandy. I've used all different kinds of frozen concentrate juices instead of lemonade though they're always red. I do use the orange juice called for in the recipe. So much easier than the old fashioned way of making slush! My family always looks forward to this at my house so I not only make it at Christmas (which is my family's tradition) but I now make it for other holiday gatherings as well. I make a triple batch so it takes several days for it to become slushy!",
