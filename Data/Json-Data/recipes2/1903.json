Add other seasonings stir occasionally about 5 mins. Preheat oven to 350. Add a little h20(this will cut the sodium) add soup and broth continue cooking another 5 mins. Flatten biscuits to fit pan( leaving enough to cut into strips to put on top. Grease pan with butter, line w/biscuits,add chicken mixture, top w/remaining biscuit strips. Bake 25mins. Let cool 5mins.
