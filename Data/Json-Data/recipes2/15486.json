Also melt it in the microwave first to avoid curdling. -Use about half as much pasta as is called for or however much you desire- but the recommended amount is waaaaay too much. -Season the canned tomatos to taste or even add your own garden-fresh ones. Better produce makes better food. Other than that it's a great idea and works out well. The brie loses its sometime too strong flavor while maintaining its signature sweetness. Well done! =D",

However paring it with a spinach salad and a glass of shiraz made it quite balanced overall. I disagree with other reviewers who say to increase the Brie or decrease the pasta. There is a distinct taste of Brie in the dish and I believe more would be too much. The amount of pasta is also just right. Cutting the pasta in half as one reviewer recommended would result in pasta floating in a sauce. I made this dish in February. However I think it would be best as a light dish during a cool summer evening. (A good option for those going for Meatless Mondays too.) Cheers!",
