Instead of garlic salt I used garlic powder. The family thought this was very good and I was impressed it turned out so well with a jarred sauce. This was great for me as it's a while until we see payday and this used ingredients I had on hand.",

I am really glad I made those two additions since it totally hid the jarred taste.  I did leave the chicken out of this recipe and served marinated grilled chicken cut on the diagonal over top.    The bacon is what made this so good, but bacon makes everything better!  I'll make this again and toss in some frozen peas.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
