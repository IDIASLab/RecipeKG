Came up with this creamy blend of cream cheese, sour cream, and avocado seasoned with ranch dressing mix, hot sauce, etc. Excellent with tortilla chips. Add more hot sauce, if you like (I don't add lemon juice because the sour cream already gives it tartness). We couldn't stop eating it!",

Great as a dip but add a little milk or heavy cream and it makes a good dressing too. Works well poured over salted cherry tomatoes with blue cheese crumbles or with a salad. Since my food processor is not very big I used a blender and flash blended to the consistency I was looking for. It's even better the next day. I'm sure most of you know but Neufchatel cheese is simply 1/3 less fat cream cheese.",

Be aware of how much you need b/c the dip does start to brown (b/c of the avocado) so it starts looking unattractive if you are wanting to keep it.  You could maybe put lemon juice in it to stop the browning, but not sure what that would do to the taste. But, this was very good.",

The first time I made it exactly as written and it was really really good. The second time I made it I made the following modifications: used 3 avocados celery and garlic powders as opposed to salt (I think the Ranch dressing mix has more than enough salt and I put salt on everything) 1 full TBS of hot sauce and instead of using the food processor left everything kind of chunky. I just used a spatula to mix up the (softened) cream cheese (cubed) and sour cream mixture and left the avocados rather chunky too. Next time I make it (and there will be many next times) I'm going to double the hot sauce to 2 TBS and leave everything chunky. Maybe add a little garlic but really this recipe doesn't need much tweaking. Outstanding! I'm spooning it over my pulled pork sandwich and may have found food nirvana:) Note: There was some slight separation on the third day but it did not affect the flavor and was easy to mix up again. I did not find any discoloration due to the avocado either like others have said.",
