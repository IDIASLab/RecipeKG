I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added the zest of one of the limes for more lime-y flavor. They are excellent! Served with Tangy Cucumber and Avocado Salad from this site.

Then add it to taste and not necessarily as much as the recipe calls for and you will have a dish tailored specifically to your liking. Similarly with the lime juice - while we used considerably less Cajun seasoning than called for and were happy with that we used the amount of lime juice called for (and it was a good sized lime!) found it wasn't \"limey\" enough for our liking and squeezed extra on afterward. Hubby just broiled these rather than grilling them a few minutes on each side. We used these to top \"Lemon Vinaigrette Salad \" also from this site.",
