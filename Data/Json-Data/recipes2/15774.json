Use 2 8oz packages of cream cheese (the whipped cream cheese was MUCH easier to work with) 3 eggs 4 cups of sugar With those changes the topping was much creamier and the pudding based cake mix kept the bottom layer very moist held together over all a lot better. Also found that if you let this cool and settle 12-24 hours before presentation it's just that much better. A very good recipe!! Always gets compliments and never a bite left.",
