I will get the dough as thin as possible and make the strips for the braid smaller and thinner. Also I will add a good bit more cheese.

Stomboli is my husband's favorite so I made this with my grandparents for a test run...want to make it for his birthday!(He's a Jersey Boy so it's gotta be GOOD!!) We made our own dough and left it in the bread maker too long so it was hard to stretch it! Nor could we braid it so our stromboli looked like a gigantic calzone! Also 20x8 IS HUGE!! We could only stretch our dough to 15x7 and had to call more family over to help us eat it! Like others we spread garlic butter over the top before baking and used the new Kraft Parmesan/Asiago/Romano grated cheese on top of that...SOOO GOOD!!! My aunt was picking the grated cheese crumbs off the plate-it's very yummy toasted! The only change I recommend besides making it smaller is adding a lot more pepperoni and more cheese:) Will definitely be making this for my husband's birthday!!",
