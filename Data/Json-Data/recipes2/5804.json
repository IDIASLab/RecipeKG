One suggestion though when measuring the cottage cheese I use a large slotted spoon and kind of squeeze the liquid from the cottage cheese and place in the measure cup and then use the back of that spoon to squeeze a bit more out. You can then add more cottage cheese to the measure cup and do the same thing. It leaves you with a firmer egg muffin. Add any vegetables and seasoning your family likes. I avoid adding cheese unless I am 100% certain that it is lactose free. This is a nice recipe to take to gatherings and be able to say it is both lactose and gluten free.",
