Based on other reviews I changed the following; sauteed my onions first, added a sprinkling of red pepper flakes and used a 5 cheese blend (parmesean, asiago, romano, mozzarella and provolone..kraft makes this already shredded). I halved the recipe as I only had a few people over. They raved about it and of course wanted the recipe. I served the dip with vegetables and crackers. I also thought it would be fun to put the dip in a bread bowl. Will probably do that next time. Thanks for a fast,easy recipe!",

I put my chopped onion in the food processor and basically pulverized it. I then sauteed it in 1T of melted butter, and lightly salted the onion as it sauteed. Then, since this was a last-minute idea, I ADDED COLD CREAM CHEESE to the onions in the warm pan, and stirred in all the remaining ingredients (the parm was last) over medium low heat until it was smooth. I then baked it, and garnished it with chives. It was served with Sea Salt Bagel Chips from Trader Joe's, and was a hit! This recipe was so, so easy, and so, so delicious. Five stars, any day. This is being added to my personal recipes tonight! Thanks for sharing this one.  :)",

I reduced the ingredients (only 4 of us eating it) and was very happy with it.  I think I would prefer to saute the onions before baking it next time.  I'll have to try and see.  But it was a hit, even with my son, who HATES onions! (I didn't tell him onions were in it, either.)  \n\nThis was fast, easy, and very good.  I will definitely make this again.",
