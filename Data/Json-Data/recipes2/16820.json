My husband and I followed all the directions except we did not have scallions, but scallions would not have saved this dish.  This dish is just *way* too sour!  It was unedible.  Even after we tried to \"fix\" it, it still tasted like Key Lime Fish.  So unless you really, really love lime, use maybe 1/4 the amount of lime juice that is specified in the recipe.  You can always add more if it's not enough for your taste.",

I cooked 8 oz. fresh white mushrooms in some butter and then added 1 1/2 lbs. tilapia. I added more butter to fish. I didn't have lemon zest or green onion and it was still tasty. I also used coarse sea salt instead of kosher. I will try to add the zest next time I bet it gives it a nice zing! We loved the lime flavor and I would increase that the next time to accomodate the larger amout of fish. This was so fast and easy especially after a long day at work! Thanks BGP!",

I substituted about 2 cups fresh portobella mushrooms for the dried porcini and shallots for the scallions (just because these were the ingredients I had on hand). I cooked this in a large frying pan with a cover so after the first side of the fish was done I flipped it over dumped the mushrooms in and then put the cover on. This kind of steamed it all. IMO this recipe only makes 2 servings though.",
