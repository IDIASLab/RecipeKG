I was surprised how easy it really was to do. I made one pot with cherry brandy, one with mint liqueur and one with Irish cream. Couldn\u2019t taste the cinnamon at all so I don\u2019t even know if it is necessary. All 3 fondues received rave reviews and the chocolate kept its consistency nicely within the pots over a low tea light. For dipping- mini cheesecakes, angel food cake squares, potato chips, pretzels, graham cracker sticks, strawberries, bananas, Granny Smith apples, pineapple & dried apricots.",
