One caveat, however: if you're making this for a family or party, the idea that the recipe would \"serve 10\" seems preposterous to me. Maybe 10 little kids. Or 10 people who have a lot of other food choices and will only take little helpings of ambrosia. But not 10 people who, like me and my family, see a bowl full of ambrosia, get excited, and take great, healthy helpings of the stuff in anticipation of it being gone by the time they go back for seconds. For that lot, better make more. I wouldn't necessarily double the whole recipe, however. It's got plenty of mandarin oranges; maybe just double the fruit salad, put in 1 1/2 times the recommended marshmallows and coconut, and use 12-14 oz of sour cream instead of 8. (I don't do the nuts.) Adding some red grapes or pineapple chunks can also work.",
