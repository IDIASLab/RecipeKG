They taste just like Almond Joy bars! I used the 4c. of coconut increased the Karo syrup to 1/3c. and added 1tsp. of coconut ext. to that mixture. I used Hershey's semi-sweet chips (may try dark chips next time) and only 1 tblspn. of shortening (which I thought was more than enough). I also did wizz the coconut through my food processor for a few seconds for a finer texture as another reviewer suggested. They were easy to roll and form into little mounds. I did freeze them for about 30 minutes and re-formed them so I didnt have any coconut pieces hanging. Delicious! Will definately make again!",

                "reviewBody": "Okay here's a brief breakdown of my tips on this recipe: 1) Use shredded coconut instead of flaked. I don't know if you can put flaked coconut in the blender or food processor to grind it up but if you can do it. 2) I used 8oz of corn syrup (half a 16 oz bottle) for this amount of coconut. I also didn't bother cooking the corn syrup I just drizzled it into the mixer bowl of coconut while the mixer was running. 3) Don't make them too big. 4) I toasted my almonds. 5) Chill the coconut balls before dipping in chocolate 6) To dip them in chocolate I used two forks. I dropped them into the chocolate upside-down then used the two forks to pick up the candy turn it over to make sure the sides were coated then I raised the candy up tilted slightly to the side to drain off the excess without compromising a smooth texture on the top. Then I placed them on a parchment-lined baking sheet to harden. 7) After the chocolate dip has hardened DO IT AGAIN. Once is really not enough to get a good thick chocolate shell. 8) Oh almost forgot-- I didn't bother with the shortening. Pure chocolate was all I needed-- these do NOT last long. They really do taste just like the candy bar. AWESOMENESS!!!",

I also added 1/3 cup corn syrup and a whole bag of coconut. I dipped the balls and lifted them out with a fork. Just lay the almond on top right after you dip and they stay nicely. I put them in goodie bags no problem with the almonds coming off.",
