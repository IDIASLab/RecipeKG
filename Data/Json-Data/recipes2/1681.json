For the topping I used equal amounts of real butter and margarine 1/4 tsp. parsley and about 1/8 tsp of garlic salt. Also my family really likes the garlic flavor so I added one clove of fresh minced garlic to the mix (I use a garlic press). Also instead of brushing the butter mixture on at the end I decided to do it while they were cooking to get better flavor... I brushed once after cooking for about 5 minutes and then again when they were almost done. It gave them a nice golden color and the flavor was amazing. If you are looking for something close to Red Lobster this is definitely the way to go.",

So scouring my cupboards I found a packet of chicken flavor ramen seasoning. I added that packet to the biscuit mixture baked as directed. When out of the oven I put slivers of butter on top to melt (omitting the garlic powder). Really quite good. I did not miss the cheese at all. I will experiment with this recipe.",
