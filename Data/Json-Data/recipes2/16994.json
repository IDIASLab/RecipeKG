I really enjoyed it and so did my husband who is a bit nervous about polenta (especially in the tube:) I did make some variations and changes. I added half a chopped red pepper and red onion for color. I used two zuchinni because I didn't have eggplant. I also used taco mix because I didn't have fajita. I didn't use the whole packet (to cut down on sodium). I also didn't put the salsa or olives on the casserole. I think the salsa could make it a bit watery so I decided not to. Also I sprinkled oregano pepper and garlic powder over the polento circles before adding the bean mixture. I also think that you could cut down on the amount of beans (personal preference) as it seemed to overwhelm the vegetable mixture at times. I used 1 can of kidney beans and half a can each of garbonzo and cannellini beans.I also used a fiesta blend of cheese isntead of the mozzarella. I served the casserole with salsa olives and sour cream. The flavor was great. Will make again! Thanks Karen.:)",

It would also be good with crumbled burger or seasoned tofu to add some extra protein. Easy quick and yummy!",

I omitted the kidney beans (did not have any); only used 3/4 pack of fajita seasoning and served the salsa on the side w/sour cream & guacamole. It could use something to hold the beans/corn together (serve with caution..LOL)...but NO ONE slowed down on eating it. Very tasty....try with Mexican Rice II Sweet Corn Tomalito Best Guacamole & of course some Margaritas!:) ENJOY!",
