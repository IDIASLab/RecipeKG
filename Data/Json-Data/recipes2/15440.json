The first time I went by her directions and wound up with the \"nut butter\" the previous commenter got. Between reading this recipe and talking to a friend who bakes seriously I got it right the second time. Two things I did wrong the first time were not combining the ingredients as indicated here (mom's handwritten recipe said \"mix all ingredients...big mistake!) I overmixed it to a batter consistency instead of more of a dough and didn't add flour when it was too loose. They are well worth the effort! My husband almost cried because he said this were \"Christmas at home\" for him. Thank you Kit!",

After creaming the butter and sugar I stirred about a cup of flour in the bowl. Then I added the rest of the flour by hand. The consistency of the batter was perfect. I baked them for 15 minutes only any more time and they would have burned. I would have given this recipe 4 stars had I used confectioner's sugar to roll them after baking. But since I dipped them in chocolate 5 stars are DEFINITELY in order. I melted 1 cup of bittersweet chocolate and 2 teaspoons of shortening for the dip.",
