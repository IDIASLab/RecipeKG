Many recipes include other spices and herbs that may or may not be right for all dishes. This is a base recipe that can be adjusted to your likes and preferences but suit most savory soups and stews. Make sure your products are gluten-free when purchasing because some yeasts are not certified as such.",

Excellent recipe for a quick GF bouillon substitute which worked extremely well for us in a variety of recipes tonight. I used it as a bouillon sub in Dry Onion Soup Mix (by Faye Watkins) which was needed in Rempel Family Meatloaf (also from this site). It also worked well for making a vegetarian gravy (sorry recipe is in my head). I had 2 cups of this author's Vegan Stock and needed more stock/liquid for the gravy (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/237980/gluten-free-vegan-stock-for-the-slow-cooker/). The ratio of 1 tbsp powder to 1 cup water was perfect. Also tested using it as a bouillon sub for the Slow Cooker Mashed Potatoes (by BWAYE) we usually make at Thanksgiving. It worked great and I'll never spend money on rarely used bouillon ever again! Thank you for this recipe Buckwheat Queen!",
