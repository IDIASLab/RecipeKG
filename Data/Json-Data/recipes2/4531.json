While it's not something you'd make everyday unless you're looking to clog your arteries it's nice to splurge once in a while. I added the bacon at the end and served this with a bunch of napkins...

I kept reading the recipe but I didn't see where you add the actual bacon to the sandwich so I just added it at the end w/ the lettuce tomato and egg.
