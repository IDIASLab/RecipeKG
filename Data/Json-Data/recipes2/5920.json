Probably up the oatmeal and chia and leave everything else the same - I definitely wanted it to be a bigger batch!",

Then I found that the same brand makes another flavor which is cinnamon raisin and used that omitting the honey and I added finely chopped walnuts to the mix. I also sprinkled these with a little cinnamon sugar. Yummy. My next attempt will be with their maple flavored peanut butter just for a change but I have to say both the recipes that I have made have come out great. One other thing I omitted the white chocolate and just added the mini dark choc morsels instead. They are a great little pick me up in the early morning. By the way Amazon carries the peanut butter if you can't find it on the shelf at your grocery.",

(For anyone else who needs to know 2 oz of chocolate is just over 1/3 of a cup.) My only complaint about this recipe is that I ended up with little bitter specks of coffee that didn't blend with the other flavors. This is definitely worth making again but next time I'll try a more finely ground instant coffee. I bet it would be delicious with a presweetened flavored kind as another reviewer suggested. All in all this was a quick easy recipe that makes a tasty snack for coffee lovers! Update: I made the recipe again with instant cappuccino powder which was good and didn't have that bitter taste. However I had to add an extra couple tablespoons of it to get a strong enough coffee flavor. I used about half the white chocolate it called for since the coffee had sugar of its own. Still plenty sweet! I rolled the finished balls in grated coconut which added a nice flavor as well as made them look pretty.",
