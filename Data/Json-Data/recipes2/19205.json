It's important to let that mixture cool to room temp before layering over the cheese. And the mushroom soup gives it a wonderful flavor. All in all, this is a KEEPER recipe and one I'll make over and over with different variations, such as fresh mushrooms, green peppers, garden tomatoes, etc. I love recipes that can be tweaked and this is a perfect example!",

The overnight 'resting' is critical to the recipe because it really enhances the flavor and helps create the fluffy texture which really makes the dish. I used fresh ground sausage fron our loal supermarket and added a teaspoon of sage. If you don't care for sage leave it out. The sage did kick it up a notch though.",
