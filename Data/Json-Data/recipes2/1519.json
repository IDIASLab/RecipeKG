Crispy crunchy flavorful yummy goodness. This is the BEST fried chicken I've ever made. (Makes me almost feel like a professional cook although far from it. Lol) And my kids absolutely LOVE this! (And I have a super picky eater on my hands) It's to die for with the Korean Fried Chicken Sauce but still equally as good without. I personally prefer it with the sauce as it's nice and spicy. And face it we could all use a little spice in our lives.:-) This will definitely be my go-to fried chicken recipe from now on. I know some people might think this is a bit time consuming to have to fry this in two steps but believe me when I say the effort is totally worth it!! I'd give this 10 stars if I could!!",

I didn't have a deep fryer so I used my good ole' heavy skillet.  At first I was put off because the chicken once battered stuck to the bottom of the skillet, but I figured out that I needed to turn it once intially after a few seconds and it came out great!  I am making it for Easter dinner at my family's request!  Watch the video, it is very helpful.  At first I thought it was just regular hard fried chicken, but I was wrong.  The flavors came together so well.  Try it, it will soon be a family fav.",

                "reviewBody": "Absolutely delicious!! I found that I only needed 2/3 of a cup of cold water I started out with 3/4 of a cup and my batter was too thin so I had to add some more flour and corn starch to it to thicken it up. We had 2 lbs of chicken and still had some batter left over. I'm thinking I'm going to use it tomorrow with some whole mushrooms since it has the onion and garlic flavor in it. I recommend you watch the video on Foodwishes.com before cooking because he gives some really neat tips that were very helpful. This chicken was moist and crunchy and fabulously tasty! The Korean Fried Chicken Sauce also listed on this site is VERY hot and we love spicy however 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes is a nice amount of heat. If you don't tolerate heat at all leave it out altogether do a taste test and add a tiny amount if you feel it needs a little heat. I made a double batch and only used 1/4 tsp. because my daughter doesn't tolerate spicy and it still had a little bite to it but she said it was tolerable. You can always add more red pepper flakes to individual servings for those who do want more heat so others can enjoy a less spicy sauce. I used half sweet chili sauce and half Sambal Oelek chili sauce (which is spicier than sweet chili sauce) in which both can be found in your local Asian Market. I also think it had too much lemon juice but he does say adjust to your taste. I had to add 2 tsp. of sugar to off set the tart. Next time I will start with 1/2 juiced lemon. Wonderful!",
