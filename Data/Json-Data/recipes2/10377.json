One thing I did do though as it was first served to me this way at some friends house in Santiago is top it with rasberries. They are just tart enought to balance out the sweetness of it.

I couldn't bring myself to add a full cup of powdered sugar to the meringue only added 1/2 and that may have been too much! I wasn't sure what I was looking for as far as \"thick\" goes so I did cook it for 30 minutes. This is rather like a caramel pudding when it's set and the texture is very smooth and nice...but it is REALLY rich and sweet! Thank you Fran =)",

It was late and due the next day. I ran to the store and bought canned whipped cream! That's right. I cheated. She took individual little bowls for each student and put the whipped cream on each along with sprinkling cinnamon on top. The kids LOVED it! They licked the little bowls clean!!!! This really was good. Can't wait to try it again so that I can hopefully get that meringue correct!",
