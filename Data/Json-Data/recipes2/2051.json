Used the method of cooking popcorn found on this site in a paper bag - one/half cup popcorn mixed with 3/4 tsp oil and placed in paper lunch bag folding the top over several times. In our microwave the popcorn cooked in 1 1/2 minutes but the directions say 2-3 minutes stopping when there are 2 seconds between pops. Any method you chose for your popcorn however don't make the same mistake I made and dump it directly nto the marshmallow mix -it took forever to dig out the unpopped kernels. The second batch I poured the popped corn onto paper towels and picked out the unpopped kernels before using. Also melted the marshmallows and butter together in a large pot on the stove and then turned it off before adding the popcorn. Quick and easy. This made 12 - 13 large treats.",
