Not the most attractive appearance (brown in color) but I couldn't stop eating it! You must like the flavor of smoke and oysters however. As for the 24 servings it doesn't make much. There is enough to probably top 24 small crackers but if each guest eats 4 crackers that will only serve 6 people. I managed to eat the whole thing all by myself as a snack so you might want to double it for gathering! Ingredients can easily be kept on hand for surprise guests. A keeper!!",

The recipe did not indicate though if the oil that the oysters are packed in should be used in the recipe or not. I dribbled in only a few drops of the oil at first and then only added enough until I got a taste I liked. Too much of the oil cancels out the smokey oyster taste. Also did not mash up the oysters too fine. I prefered getting substantial bites of the oysters.",
