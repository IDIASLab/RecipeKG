I would suggest raising the temp to 350 for 45 min. so you can cook it along with other dishes. I would definitely recommend lightly sprinkling some 'Accent' on each layer of oysters (it especially brings out the flavor of oysters). I've always made it with milk and be sure to let it set for an hour to absorb the liquid. It doesn't fluff up during baking if you skip this step.",

I let it sit for an hour b4 baking it but it was really runny. After baking it was just slop! Doesn't souffle need eggs & egg whites to help it set up? I would guess about 3 eggs seperated & beaten. Maybe I should have used just one cup of H&H? Maybe add a pinch of nutmeg for subtle flavor too. OK- revision to previous tirade - After this souffle sat for about half an hour to 45 minutes it did set up into a souffle like consistency but it was cold. I still think it was bland & tasted more like crackers than oysters.",

We also use saltines instead of Ritz type crackers. It is FABULOUS if you are an oyster lover like we are!",
