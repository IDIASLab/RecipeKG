This staple in our household is a favorite of all who try it! You can BBQ in summer or broil in the winter for a perfect, filling meal. I like corn on the cob and some sort of rice to complement this mouth watering steak.",

My flank steak was extrememly thin so I only grilled it for 3 minutes per side on medium. I served a Chimmichuri sauce on top of the steaks and that really cut the sweetness of the marinade - complimented it beautifully. To make the Chimmichurri Sauce, I put 1/2 c fresh parsley, 3 T olive oil, 2 T red wine vinegar, 3 cloves of crushed garlic and 1/2 t salt in a mini food processor. Pureed it until everything was blended and then poured a thick strip of sauce down the center of the slices of steak on everyone's plate. All I can say is that it was absolutely delicious and we are going to be making this steak all the time in the future!",

I followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the optional chilli, and tripled the garlic (we are garlic lovers).  I marinated for abuot 24 hours, and the meat was soooooooo flavorful. I over-grilled it accidentally, so it wasn't as tender as I like, but I think if you make it rare or medium it will be just right.  Two days' worth of dinner gone in one sitting.  I kept the marinade, and plan to use on some leftover cooked chicken.",
