Either its a misprint or someone really loves garlic powder...but 2 tablespoons is outrageous. I would say 1/2 teaspoon is good enough. I only halved the recipe because I was skeptical of the amount of garlic and soy sauce. I didn't use anywhere near the amount of soy sauce called for. I used less than a tablespoon to brush over the tops of the wontons. While I think its a good idea the amount of garlic and soy sauce needs to be adjusted. I also think the egg yolk is not needed. I would make this again but with major adjustments to the garlic.",
