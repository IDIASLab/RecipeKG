I made mine into ping-pong- ball size, and I got 27.  Second, maybe I need some help with my meatball technique, but they kind of sat down in the skillet, as if they wanted to be a patty.  Perhaps some kind of paleo-approved flour would help, or some time in the fridge to firm up.  Third, the olive oil was browning too fast, so I had to finish up in the oven, about 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  I'm not sure how covering the skillet would have helped them  brown.  Anyway, these had a great flavor, prepared with the listed ingredients, and I would be happy to make again, but with some thought about the method.   Thanks for the idea!",
