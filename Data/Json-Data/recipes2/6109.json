Also if you have a problem with the sauce not sticking or being too thin you can add a little COLD water to a little bit of corn or potato starch in a separate small ball until dissolved and add that right before you turn off the heat to thicken the sauce. You can also add arrowroot directly into the sauce to thicken the sauce before you finish cooking/turning off the heat.",
