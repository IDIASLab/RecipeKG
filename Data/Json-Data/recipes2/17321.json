Once the butter starts to simmer, watch very closely to make sure it doesn't burn. My husband loves vegetables cooked this way. I have used many different types of fresh vegetables and this seems to work with most any vegetable. (This recipe is for 1 1/2 pounds vegetables.)",

To cut some cals I think I'm going to sautee in UnChix broth. I'll finish w/1 T. of browned butter. Totally forgot to add the wine but it was great w/o. I added the onions garlic and almonds at the same time so they would sweeten and tenderize as well. Used red onion for added sweetness. This time I only used broccoli but I see this method arising time and time again w/different vegetable combos!!! Great for a vegetarian diet if u can cut some of the fat!",

Before making this dish I boiled a pot of water, added the broccoli and cauliflower and let it cook for a minute, drained, and set aside. I also toasted some almonds. I used only a 1/4 cup butter because I thought a 1/2 cup was a bit too much. In the skillet with butter, I added a piece of garlic, chopped, then the red bell peppers, wine, broccoli and cauliflower. I stirred to combined on medium low heat. I seasoned with salt and black pepper, to taste. Lastly, I added the toasted almonds over everything. The browned butter with almonds gave this a nutty flavor to these vegetables. I loved the tenderly crunch from the red bell peppers and its sweetness. The bright red color of the red bell peppers looked so pretty in this dish. I liked the aroma of the butter with wine and garlic. The almonds gave this a nice texture with a nutty crunch. I served alongside with incredible cheesey turkey meatloaf and bacon rosemary mashed potatoes, from this website.",

Per review by recipe submitter Wilemon I did steam the veggies for about five mins before adding to skillet. Thank you Wilemon!",
