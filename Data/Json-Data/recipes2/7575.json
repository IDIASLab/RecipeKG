I decided to refrigerate it overnight and give it another chance while researching other recipes for caponata. This morning I tasted it again and what difference! Wow! I added the olives which another reviewer also did. I probably will make this again but cut way back on the spice sugar and vinegar. In my opinion I would like it better without tasting pickled.",
