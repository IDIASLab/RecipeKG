The eggnog I started with was not very strongly spiced; once the ingredients were mixed the result tasted more like a lightly spiced french vanilla than an eggnog flavour so I added some freshly grated nutmeg some allspice and a bit of cinnamon to the mixture bring out the eggnog flavour. I left it to stand in the fridge overnight before putting it in the ice cream maker. Will definitely make again; perhaps I will add some rum soaked raisins to the next round for the grown ups.",

I tasted the mixture before I put it into the machine and felt that it needed nutmeg so I added a pretty healthy dose of freshly-ground nutmeg to the custard. The texture is creamy smooth just perfect for scooping. And the flavor is classic eggnog very rich and crazy good (also very decadent!). Thanks CHRISTYGOBAR for this fantastic and EASY recipe; it's going into my Favorites folder. It's in the freezer right now waiting to top Thanksgiving pumpkin pie this Thursday.",

If you are like me and don't like your desserts too sweet or too rich try using 2 1/2 cups eggnog and 2 cups whole milk instead of heavy cream and you can keep everything else the same. I didn't have vanilla extract handy so I scraped out the seeds of two vanilla beans. I also put in some cinnamon allspice nutmeg and clove... if you do this be sure to add the spices through a sifter while stirring so that they don't clump up. I don't think this could have came out any better! Will def make again!!!",

I don't care much for sweetened condensed milk because I think it leaves a major aftertaste so I was a little worried that this ice cream would have that issue. It was absolutely scrumptious and oh so easy. If you are looking for a consistency of a shake then it's good to go right out of the ice cream freezer but if you are looking for an ice cream to scoop into dishes I recommend following the tip to freeze in an airtight container for a few hours or overnight.",
