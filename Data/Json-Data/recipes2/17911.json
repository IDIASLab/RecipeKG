At first, I was reluctant to try it b/c it seemed like a weird combination and rather boring, but that is NOT TRUE. TRY IT. The hummus sort of melts a bit into the dough and makes it soft and moist and delicious, but still (sort of) pizza-like. I added onion and got rid of broccoli (personal preference), but I get the feeling you can add pretty much whatever you want on this - alfalfa sprouts, anything. Again, WOW - a keeper.",
