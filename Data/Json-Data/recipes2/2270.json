We have been making an old family egg nog recipe for generations completely from scratch but probably won't as often now that we've found this recipe. It is SOOOOooo much easier and less risky due to no raw eggs. Store-bought eggnog is nothing like the real stuff and maybe that's the confusion the first reviewer experienced. I made this for a holiday open house and it was a HUGE hit with everyone and my husband did a mock-decree that \"No other nog shall ever be served within this house hence forth!\" The unsweetened make sure to not sweeten! whipped cream and the coffee take the curse off the too-sweet store-bought egg nog. BTW I made mine with Canadian whiskey - yummy - and made a non-alcoholic version with decaf coffee for the kids and a pregnant friend and they all loved that as well. I wish I could give this more stars to make up for that other negative review! If you're a true egg nog devotee but are crunched for time you'll love this recipe!",

Only three people tried it (myself included) and no one went back for a second glass. The colour is kind of off-putting and with the pieces of floating ice cream it looks rather unappetizing. The flavour was not horrible but it wasn't very good either. I will not be making this recipe again.",

I'm sure she'll be making it on her own for years to come over the holidays (Christmas New Years hey maybe even July 4th for my birthda...YEA!). The version that I made for her was a little lighter on the whiskey side but the other half that I prepared for my sister and sister in law was more on point. They absolutely loved it as did I. I will try rum next time as suggested by the recipe poster. Thanks for the recipe!!",
