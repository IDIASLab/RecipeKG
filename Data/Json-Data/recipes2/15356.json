We used pine nutes instead of sunflower as we do not really care for the latter and it worked fine...the arugula (aka rocket) is just an outstanding salad flavour. Salad is not overly leafy and the colours are very appealing. We dressed with a simple balsamic vineagrette. We will defnitely make this in future.",
