I found the consistency to be better when I tried it with smooth peanut butter and tossed some crushed peanuts on top when serving. I also added a half cup more of chicken stock and the juice of half a lime for that authentic tangy Thai zing. When cooking for kids or those not fond of spicy dishes substitute the chile for 2 Tbs. sweet chile sauce. All in all a great sauce.",
