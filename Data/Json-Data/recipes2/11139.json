DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THIS ADVICE! We really enjoy hot and spicy foods but this was WAY TOO HOT! I did eat it and I did finish it but it was a bit painful to do. The spices got to my sinuses and my nose was running so much that I went through 7 tissues during dinner. And the ceiling fan that was keeping us nice & cool seemed as if it was no longer functioning. We had sweat dripping from us by the time we were through. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because it does have potential. I will try it again but I'll cut back on the cayenne by at least half.",
