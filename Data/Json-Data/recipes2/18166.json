I am giving this recipe 3 stars because I think that it is MUCH better with salted peanuts and I think that it should be noted that it's very important to work quickly! Like a previous reviewer mentioned the caramels set very quickly after melting! The juxtaposition of sweet caramel and salted peanuts is the key to good peanut brittle. You can whip this recipe up in a snap and it's delicous! In a nutshell: 1. Use SALTED ROASTED PEANUTS 2. Work fast! I hope everyone enjoys this as much as we did!",

Also you have to work quickly after the caramels are melted - they harden quickly.",
