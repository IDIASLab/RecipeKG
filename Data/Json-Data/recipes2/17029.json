I had to add water to get it soup consistency. Now that I think about it the recipe submitter probably meant the other famous brand that is not condensed. Either way this was good. I did think the veggie ratio was off for 2 pounds of ground beef. I ended up throwing in a handful of frozen green beans and peas. I would definitely make this again. It is super simple.",
