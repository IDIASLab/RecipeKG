The second time I made it for my personal taste - I used 10 Oz of  sweetened consensed milk, 3 heaping tablespoons of pumpkin and 1-1/2 tsp of spice, this way it really gave me the less sweet coffee house pumpkin spice kick I was looking. Give it a try either way it's a good recipe. Thanks for posting!",

I made it on the stove instead of the microwave, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I made it using one of the pumpkin pie spice recipes that is also on this site.  This is definitely sweet, but that's how I like it.  My husband tried it as well and is very happy with it.  This is a keeper and I will be making this again in the future.  Next time I may try it using 2% milk and fat free sweetened condensed milk.  \n\nThank you very much for sharing this recipe!",

The result of this recipe is a delicious creamer for your coffee!  AND... I also used this with vanilla ice cream to make a pumpkin milk shake - WOW!
