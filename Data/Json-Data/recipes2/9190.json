The best part of these egg muffins is you can use any of your favorite fillings. I love to use leftover sausage, zucchini, spinach, and tomatoes. These are great to freeze and just quickly microwave for your on-the-go breakfast. For those following the Paleo diet or are gluten free, these are the perfect recipe for you! Make a salad and enjoy for lunch or dinner!",

I crumbled the sausage instead of processing and subbed Mexican shredded cheese. I also sprinkled cayenne pepper instead instead of red peppers. Made about 18 muffins for me. Added saut\u00e9ed garlic and onions instead of scallions, saut\u00e9ed red and green peppers.  Loved the edges of the tomatoes that I added in combination with the sausage- no soggy middle. I am experimenting with adding cheese to the tops now. Can't go wrong with this recipe! Thanks to the cook!",

I do not have a food processor so chop the sausage up finely. I have also substituted ham or bacon. I add no salt since any of these processed meats is salty enough. I use the other herbs as stated in recipe. Perfect. For 24 I use 12 eggs and 1 pt egg whites. I never have Fontina cheese so use sharp cheddar. Sometime I will get Fontina to try it. I also add ribbons of fresh spinach to add to nutrients. I always put the meat, cheese, spinach and onions in the bottom of the greased cups before pouring the egg and herb mixture in. I give each cup a little stir before its 15 min bake. They are a nice breakfast with no carbs!",
