I'm not complaining because I love winter and snow; and we've had a lot of both! Anyway, my gang went crazy over this soup as they always order F.O. soup as an appetizer when we go out for dinner, however these were the changes I made: I only used four large onions, two small cans of low salt beef broth, two cans of beef consomme', a tablespoon of sugar added to the onion while sauteeing and a tablespoon of flour just before the onion was done browning. I used Guinness beer which gave it a great flavor. Thanks so much Carolyne for cluing us in on the dry mustard and beer additons!",
