I was a bit shocked at the amount of marinade this made but I think it was because my limes refused to give me a decent amount of juice despite coaxing! I made 6 chicken thighs. Husband undercooked it quite a bit on the grill but the chicken I had before it went in for more cooking was very good! Husband even commented on how good it tasted. Unfortunately we didn't get to have the chicken as planned due to the cooking issue but I tried some of the cooked part. Yum! Thanks! Will be making again (and cooking longer on grill).",
