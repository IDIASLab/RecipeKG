I used a green bell pepper instead of a red one since I didn't have it. I also had a little left over ricotta and put that in the layer inbetween the cream sauce and the pasta. Despite my changes it came out very good. When I make this again (yes it was that good) I will use the red bell pepper because I think it would add a little sweetness to the recipe and also add a little less onion. I used the amt as stated and it was just a little too overpowering. Also some of us are used to thickening our white sauce. Don't do it. Follow the recipe it thickens while it bakes. And I don't think the ricotta made a whole lotta difference but if I had extra I would still add it again. If I didn't it wouldn't be missed. Enjoy...",

                "reviewBody": "So I had to change a few things because I live in a place where things like vegetarian burger crumbles don't exist and because my oven cooks at a steady 600 degrees... 1) Since I don't have vegetarian burger crumbles I just left them out all together. Maybe it tastes better with them but it was still quite good without them. 2) I can't afford olive oil in this country but sunflower oil did just fine. 3) Ancho chili peppers don't exist here so I used a central-asian spicy pepper. I don't think I'll do this again because I didn't feel like the spice really added anything to the dish but I will add a second red pepper for a bit more of that flavor. 3) I didn't have mozzarella cheese but another melt-able white cheese was substituted and tasted great. Overall the recipe was good but it did come out bland as another reviewer mentioned. When I make it again this is what I will do differently: 1) I will cut the eggplant to be about 1/8 inch thick and probably use a second eggplant. 2) When baking the eggplant I will put pieces of garlic inside the eggplant slices and put butter with a sprinkle of salt on top. 3) I will salt and season the white sauce to taste and make a little extra to mix with the pasta. 4) I will mix some white sauce and cheese with the pasta before putting it in the dish to bake.",

I realized last minute that I didn't have enough penne pasta and had to sub out spaghetti but that worked. Topped it with a bit of fresh grated pecorino romano.
