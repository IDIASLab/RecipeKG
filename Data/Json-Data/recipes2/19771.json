Still with a little shredded cheese over the top this was great! Thanks again LaDonna for another great recipe!",

It was great because I could buy all the ingredients for less than five dollars and eat well for a week or longer if I made cornbread to go with. I wasn't much of a cook back then so I dumped everything in the crockpot (after I browned the meat) and left it to simmer all day. I did beef it up just a bit with a couple cans of diced tomatoes. This mixed with cream cheese makes a GREAT \"taco\" crockpot dip for large gatherings. You can also sub ground turkey or chicken for the beef. When I make this now I use my own taco seasoning only because the flavor is better.",
