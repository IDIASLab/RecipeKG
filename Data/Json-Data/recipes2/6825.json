I used a Granny Smith apple, slivered almonds, a shot of Martinelli's apple juice, and a dash of Grade B Maple Syrup all mixed up together. Didn't take but about 10 minutes and most of that was hunting ingredients and cutting up the apple..DELICIOUS!!!!! I thought I'd use pistachios or pecans but couldn't find either successfully at the time and I had no walnuts, so I went with the almonds I had in the fridge.  I will definitely make this again and hopefully by the given recipe just to do it.",
