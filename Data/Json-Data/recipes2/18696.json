This is an easy to prepare spicy herb soup with lots of broth, flavor, and a little kick. It doesn't need any fancy presentation. Simply ladle it into big bowls and serve. Don't bother using spoons, just serve it with some crusty bread and use the bread to soak up the broth.",

The title of this recipe is mislabeled in that this recipe is called a \"soup \" where in fact it is a recipe for a dipping \"broth.\" The restaurant serves shell-on shrimp in the broth along with french bread for dipping. The shrimp is eaten with your fingers like peel-and-eat shrimp. No spoons involved nor carrots celery onions or mushrooms. This is not a soup! That being said if you add red pepper flakes to this recipe and reduce the tomato paste this is a tasty and very close version of Killer's \"broth.\"",

This recipe as given has several points that will cause it to deviate from the real KS taste. (1) Too much butter. It should be 1 stick (1/2 cup) at the most and some people may find they would rather use less. (2) The shrimp MUST have the whole skin on. The flavor that the shrimp peels adds to the mix is essential, yet indefinable. (3) Double the amount of clam juice to 16 oz (4) reduce the rosemary by 1/3 and double the amount of fennel, add 1 tsp dried thyme (5) reduce the tomato paste to 3 TBSP (6) add salt, preferably sea salt (7) add 1 tsp of red pepper flakes (or to taste) (8) add hot sauce to taste. Finally, there is a secret ingredient involved, which I am not prepared to divulge. But the above will get you close.\n\nAnother reader stated she made this without fennel---without fennel it is not killer shrimp---it's just soup.",

The only changes I will make next time is to cut the tails off the shrimp. It's seems kind of silly to serve tail-on shrimp in a soup. Oh I also added some crushed red pepper. About a tsp...maybe two. The broth is awesome...really really flavorful. I served this w/ Mama D's Italian bread (from this site) which was the perfect bread for dipping in the broth Bagna cauda (from this site) w/ veggies & for dessert strawberries w/ zabaglione (also from this site).

I followed others suggestions and reduced the amount of butter and added some red pepper flakes; otherwise I followed the recipe. I did pinch the tails off of the shrimp before adding into the broth. This really impressed hubby. Thanks for a keeper recipe!!! Highly recommend!! I just also wanted to add that this had a rather salty taste despite using low sodium chicken broth. I will use unsalted butter next time. I will search for the lowest sodium broth in the future. Still delicious - just don't add any salt!:)",
