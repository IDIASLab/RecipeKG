I cut the recipe in half since I'm single but I still used 1/2 an onion as 1/4 of an onion just wasn't enough. All the other ingredients I just cut in half. I also used oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes so I drained and chopped them without pouring the boiling water since they were already quite soft. I used fat-free feta cheese to cut the calories a bit. Altogether this was a fantastic high-protein and very nutritious salad. Would be great for a light lunch or supper in the summertime and for potlucks especially if there are vegetarians. Thanks for an awesome recipe!",

I used white onion instead of red and I had no feta so I substituted an Italian cheese blend. I ate this for lunch today with some rye crackers-Yummy and Filling.

I only had about half the sundried tomatoes the recipe calls for I left out the bell pepper (a lot of relatives that HATE them) and I had to sub goat cheese for the feta because the store was out. I also used fresh beans that I soaked overnight then simmered to al dente and sprinkled with a liberal amount of kosher salt. Still the final result was out of this world!! I would love to try it again with the feta and bells but I can honestly say this recipe is deserving of its 5 stars and I will most defiitely be making it again...often.",
