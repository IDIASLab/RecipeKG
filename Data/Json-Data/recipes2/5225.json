The rice is universal enough that you could use any vegetables you like or ones you had leftover from another meal. I do have one suggestion and that is that you finely chop your fresh herbs before combining them with the oil so that they distribute better on the steak. This is a great recipe for when you are short on time or simply don't feel like slaving for hours in the kitchen.",
