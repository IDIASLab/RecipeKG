In less than an hour I came in the door emptied the dishwasher and started this recipe and had dinner on the table! I had everything in my pantry freezer or crisper. I used my own homemade frozen chicken stock that was previously thawed in the fridge overnight. I added a cup and a half of ditalini cooked al dent\u00e8 at the end. You can add it uncooked with the veggies. I added a small can of summer crisp corn and a can of chi chi beans to the recipe. The last half hour I added 6-7 large leafs of Swiss chard torn into large pieces. It s a cold rainy weekend here in NorCal this soup with a large hunk of toasty garlic bread is going to hit the spot!",
