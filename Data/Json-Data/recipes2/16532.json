I also added some pepper to the meat and half of an onion chopped very fine. I would consider at least the salt and pepper necessary. Additionally because I didn't have vegetable soup I used a can of cream of chicken and a can of milk with vegetable \"better than bouillon\". Because the milk wasn't as thick as the soup I had to thicken the sauce with flour before serving. In the end it was wonderful! I have to say though that there is plenty of room for this to be yucky if you don't substitute with the right things as some people have mentioned. Use discretion; if the soup you have doesn't seem like it would be good over noodles as a sauce don't use it in this recipe. Also I would suggest doing as I did and using milk and bouillon thickened with flour if you want to get away from the canned soup taste.",

First off I couldn't figure out which soup to use. Is condensed veg. soup the stuff that comes with the alphabet noodles in it? Well in any case that's what I used. I also used 2% evaporated milk. I baked the meatballs instead of frying them. What I ended up with was really bland meatballs in an orange goopy mess. This dish is in no way pleasing to the eye. Luckily my dad will eat just about anything.. with a dash of hot sauce he said it wasn't half bad (hence the 2 stars). I won't be making this again.",
