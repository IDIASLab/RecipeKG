She was considered the Julia Child of Italian food, and at a time when most Americans thought 'Bolognese' was spaghetti sauce with chunks of hamburger, Marcella taught us just how magnificent this meat sauce could be. I like to toss it with some mezzi rigatoni and serve it with a little grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of parsley.",

Cooking them in the oil I find generally brings out more of the flavor.  I would also add oregano or Italian seasoning blend - although a great sauce, wasn't super flavorful and that's my preference.  Otherwise, I think it's a definite keeper and just in time for the weather to turn chilly.  Thank you for sharing!",

Flavor, consistency was amazing!  Note: Follow stirring instructions, increasing times to obtain desired consistency. SAVE PASTA WATER - A cup of the pasta water will come in handy to loosen up the rich sauce if you find it too thick. I used it and it not only loosened the sauce, but it enhanced it as well.",

Although I usually stick to the recipe I did make several changes on this one. I added 4 slices of bacon, diced, with the other fats and added 2 cloves of garlic. He hates carrots so I shredded them to hide them in the sauce.  I used only Italian sausage for the meat and only used 2.5 links. Substituted Stewed Italian tomatoes for the whole tomatoes, and swapped out the milk with heavy cream. I only used 1/2 tsp. salt and substituted 1 can of low sodium chicken broth for the water.  I did skim off the fat before serving which eliminated some of the fat...hey! don't judge me :)",

I couldn't use the wine in the recipe so I added half chicken broth and half beef broth. The only issues that I found was that it did take longer to simmer each step than stated which wasn't really an issue for such a yummy recipe. It was worth the time.  I also felt that it was a little thin when it was done cooking so I had to add some tomato paste at the end to thicken it up. That didn't alter the recipe at all. It was fantastic and I'm glad that I doubled the recipe to freeze some leftovers for future use. Nice job Chef John.",
