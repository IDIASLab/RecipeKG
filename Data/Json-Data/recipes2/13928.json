I almost didn\u2019t. \nWhat I love about this site is you can type in a specific ingredient and recipes will come up for that ingredient. Today, I had canned potatoes and it brought me to this recipe. I always read reviews\u2026always. It helps to see what others who\u2019ve tried the recipe think of it. What I don\u2019t understand are reviews when the original \u2018main\u2019 ingredient is completely changed due to \u2018preference\u2019. This was a recipe for \u2018canned\u2019 potatoes. The reviews almost made me not try this because they were (almost) all about using \u2018real\u2019 potatoes. \nI mixed all the ingredients in a bowl and then put it into the pan (the before picture). I did use garlic powder instead of salt as some suggested. I added parsley towards the end of the cooking time. At 12 minutes they were fine - I like mine browner so I let it go another 2 minutes. Finished product was great! (the after picture) Thank you Jodi Smith for a wonderful way to perk up some canned potatoes. This recipe will be a go-to for me when I have canned potatoes on hand. SIDE NOTE: It's really important to drain the potatoes and rinse thoroughly.",

Next time, I will turn the heat up and cook them a little crispier. But all in all, I found something tasty and easy to do with those potatoes.

If you are going to make this recipe I STRONGLY recommend you use FRESH potatoes. Canned ones are gross! Also 2) The amount of salt in the recipe is way too much! I would recommend only 1/2 teaspoon. You can always add some more salt but it is quite hard to take it away once you have added it. If you are still ISO a garlic flavor add a few cloves of freshly minced garlic. Yum!

The spices made them look very brown and almost burnt. HOWEVER my patient roommate (who helped cook these) convinced me to give them a try. I was surprised that they tasted good!
