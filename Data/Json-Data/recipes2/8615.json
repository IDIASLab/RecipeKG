Mine did take a while longer to bake because the dish I used was a thick one that I'm sure took longer to cook through. I did have to use ancho chili powder rather than the adobo seasoning and I used a cob of fresh corn rather than the canned. Otherwise I followed the ingredient list. I will make it using adobo seasoning next time. Thank you so much Bibi!",

I followed the ingredients but just cooked the chicken in a pan and then broiled it for a couple of minutes once adding the topping and cheese. It still stayed pretty moist. I used thin cut chicken breasts too. I plan to write that part of the recipe down to save and definitely make it again soon. The rice is good I just made it on the stove top but it made a lot. It reminded me of Mexican restaurant style rice. I may make a second dish out of it this week adding meat etc. The chicken really would go well with a lot of different side dishes regardless.
