It really makes boxed mac and cheese more substantial...I only had saltines (unbuttered) for the top and it was really a casserole type dish...next time I may add broccoli mushrooms etc to make it a one-dish veggie meal. Great recipe and super fast and easy:o)",

I had to add some milk because it seemed SO thick when I mixed it all together. I guess I like my mac and cheese to be a little more creamy. This was a great way to turn a box of mac and cheese into something a little more substantial. I added chunks of cooked chicken and half of a 10 oz. bag of broccoli to make it a complete meal. I also threw in some onion powder and ground mustard to add a little bit of flavor to the boring \"processed\" taste. I also made my own crumb topping by putting two slices of bread in the oven as it pre-heated to dry them out a bit. Then I tore them up and put them into a food processor with about a tbl of cold butter some seasoning salt and pepper. Processed to a fine crumb it makes a nice crunchy topping that beats a ritz cracker. I'll probably make this again but might be worth spending a few extra cents on the campbell's healthy request just to eliminate some of the sodium.",
