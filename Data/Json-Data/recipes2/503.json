I only made a couple of changes. I made 1/2 recipe to cut the calories in half and that was plenty for 1 person. The other thing was I used a banana that was frozen which I recommended. Then at the end I added 2 ice cubes (for 1/2 recipe) that were definitely needed so this did not taste room temperature. The smoothie is almost a mint green color and I thought it tasted like oatmeal and fruit. The other person I let try it that didn't see me make it said oh this is a peanut butter flavored smoothie.:-)",
