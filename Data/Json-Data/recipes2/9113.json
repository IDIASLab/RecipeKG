She then asked if I could make it a cookie so it felt more like a treat. I made them with applesauce, added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a bit more vanilla, and used a small scoop to portion the cookies. I baked them at 350 about 12-13 minutes. They turned out great! Just enough cookie-like consistency, although a bit softer. I also let the batter stand about 5 minutes then stirred it before scooping. I plan on using pumpkin next time! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I brew a lot of tea I always end up needing more. I found I can substitute 2 - 4 ounce containers of baby food bananas for the fresh with no change of taste. I made one of each last time and they got mixed up in the freezer and he did not notice at all! I sometimes switch between almond butter and peanut butter or do a mix of both depending on what's in the house.

Needs SALT and a tad more sweetness that could be achieved with a touch of Monk Fruit or Stevia. I did the pumpkin version as not enough bananas were on hand. This pumpkin version should have measurements for recommended additional spices. Flavors of baked bars meld better after being refrigerated. So satisfying for a quick breakfast on the go.",
