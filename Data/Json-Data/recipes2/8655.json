I didn't have the dark chocolate required so I used what I had which was a mix of pure chocolate baking squares: bittersweet semi-sweet and unsweetened. I waited a few minutes for the mixture to cool slightly so that they would keep a nice shape on the waxed paper. The only change I'd make next time is to increase the ratio of almonds to chocolate as the last few flattened out more because they had less nuts in them. They made a nice hostess gift; I will surely make these again.",
