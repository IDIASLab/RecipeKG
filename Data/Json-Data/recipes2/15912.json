I tasted a few before leaving (for dinner) and thought that they were pretty good I didn't read the reviews before making them but I agree with DREGINEK to skip the oil & mix the garlic in with the cream cheese mixture. While they were baking they did get kinda \"runny\" but they were okay as they cooled. I got lucky & found 2.5 lbs. mushrooms with huge caps at Costco so I didn't have left over filling.
