The one problem I had with it was that even though I scored the dough all over, it still rose a bit and I don\u2019t know why. I just cut the puff pastry in half lengthwise to try to fix the thickness which worked okay, but I\u2019d still like to know why it rose and how I can prevent it next time. Still giving 5 stars bc mistakes were probably just made on my part.",

I added 1/4 cup of sugar instead of half to the vanilla custard filling. I also substituted the white glaze with sugar free frosting ( available at Walmar) and the chocolate liners I used decorative gel frosting pens which made it easy to adjust the brown lines. Overall great receipe and directions Thanks Chef!!!!!!",
