Instead of adding your dill pickle slices at the end of the recipe, chop them up along with the onion and tomatoes and add them here. After you let it sit and marinate in the fridge for an hour or so, you get this super delicious relish type of spread for your subs. Its the perfect match for the real Italian cold cuts! Don't skimp on the quality of the meat here either. Its well worth the extra money to buy the good stuff. I brought these to a party and they were quickly devoured. I'm originally from Boston where you can always get a great Italian sub at any one of the many \"Mom & Pop\" delis. However, I now live in the mid-west and you cannot find a decent Italian sub here! Some places actually use ham and bologna, and call it Italian!!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU and THANKS AGAIN for this recipe! For me its like a little taste of \"home\"!!!",

I like to buy a loaf of french bread cut it open, spread butter/margerine and garlic salt on both halves put the cheese on the bottom then throw it under the broiler until the cheese is melted.  I also used mozzarella cheese slices.  Then I constructed the sandwich with ham, turkey, genoa salami, and sandwich size pepperonis, then put the salad mix on top, Closed it up, sliced it to meet our family needs and served with baked chips and a cookie.  It rocked.  The salad mix does make the sandwich. Thank you.",

I made a few changes; when making the \"salad\" portion I decreased the garlic left the lettuce out until the final prep and I also did not feel it needed to be refrigerated. I also only let it sit for 15 min. while I prepped the remaining ingredients. I also added salt and pepper to the dressing. Instead of Proscuitto I chose Mortadella. Like other reviewers I like to heat the broiler and give the sandwich just a minute to melt the cheese. I also like the bread to have either mayo or butter on it. I left out the Dills and serve it with Pepperocinis. In any case this recipe has everything to recreate your favorite Italian Deli Sub.",
