Well I did what I could with that orange oil. I will drain next time or mostly drain. Thanks for the recipe! A couple days later I pressed boy 19 for a review & got at thumbs-up. Fair enough.;D",

I made them following the recipe exactly except I added a few dashes of Frank\u2019s Red Hot for a little zing. I cooked it in a crock pot for about 4 hours. I served them open-faced on grinder rolls and they were absolutely delicious! Tasted just like mom\u2019s torpedoes!",
