I've always used dill weed in my pickles, so the dill seed in this recipe was a nice change of pace and delicious! Super easy to make and tons of flavor. I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing was that this made way more brine than needed. I ended up with 14oz leftover. Next time I'll reduce the water and vinegar.  I tried the pickles after 24 hrs and they were already tasty. I'll make these again!",
