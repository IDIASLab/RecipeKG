Neither one qualifies as mayonnaise and are not as thick as the real thing, which will make your result much runnier.  You can get the chipotle chiles in adobo sauce at a supermarket with a good variety of more authentic Mexican items.  They are either canned or bottled.",

Served it on Homemade Black Bean Veggie Burgers from this site and had the most amazing southwestern-flavored meal! I wish I could give this more stars it's so good! I'll figure out a way to make this the next time I have company (maybe mixed with sour cream instead of mayo as one layer of a 7-layer dip??).",
