I followed the rest exactly and it was DELICIOUS. This was a pretty easy and healthy one pot meal. I'll definitely make this again.",

I didn't have arugula but I added more chicken a couple handfuls of frozen red bell pepper after the chicken had cooked a bit and added a dash of curry powder and some cayenne just before I added the couscous.
