I used this crappy basa fish (basa is flavorless! but cheap and all I had on hand) and didn't have cornmeal so instead used tempura flakes which stuck better after an eggwash. Mmmmm. Way good. Also I didn't have buttermilk so I found an alternative recipe using 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to 1 cup of milk. So I don't know how the recipe is really SUPPOSED tot taste like but my poorcollegestudent version had the most delicious crust ever! I would have never thought to use grill seasoning. So good!",
