So what I particularly enjoyed about this smoothie was its lower proportion of yogurt relative to the amount of fruit. What really surprised me however is that Hubs agreed and he does love his yogurt smoothies. I cut back on the vanilla just a tad and sweetened it lightly with honey. My fruit was only partially frozen so I still used the ice cubes and was happy I did this was nice and frosty cold. Beautiful color and good berry taste as this was not as heavy on the banana flavor as some smoothies including it can be.",
