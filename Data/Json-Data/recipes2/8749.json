I used a chocolate cake mix that already had some mini chocolate chips in it, so added just a mix of 1.5 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and Reese's Peanut Butter Chips to the batter.  Glad I added an extra egg as another reviewer suggested as it was on the dry side.  Not sure if that is because of the mix I used though.  Next time I'll try it with the yellow as that tends to be more moist IMHO.",
