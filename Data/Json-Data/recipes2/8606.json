One tip from years of making it for those of you who work outside the home full time: put the boneless skinless chicken breasts (frozen works great) in the crockpot with a cup of water on low all day... then you don't have to boil the chicken when you get home and it is so tender and easy to shred with two forks.  Also, I used just 2 Tablespoons butter; it works fine for a sleeve of buttery crackers.",
