For some reason it was easier working with the filling when it was chilled. Also I halved the recipe and still was able to fill 30 wontons. I will be making for a wedding reception I am catering next month. Thanks for the great recipe!!!! Addendum: (2 weeks later) I placed the filling into the wonton skins and then refrigerated for two hours. DO NOT do this. Some of the wontons turned to mushy dough. Always fry immediately after filling the wonton skins. They were still a huge hit!",

He's always asking me when I'm going to make it for him again. =0) Instead of using imitation crab I use canned crab meat. It can get pricey though. I also wrap mine differently. I like being able to taste a lot of the crab & cream cheese when I bit into it... so what I do is take a wonton wrapper put a spoonful of the mixture in the center dab beated eggs on the edges put another wonton wrapper on top & press all the edges together to seal. I make sure there isn't any air bubbles in there either because it'll explode while frying if there is. I fry them in a skillet & when I fry them I make sure to keep flipping it that way they don't explode. Anyways hope that was helpful & not confusing! =0P",

I make a whole batch of filling keep it in the fridge and fill & fry the wontons as needed. Easy easy. I just put the filling in the middle fold the wontons in half and seal with wet fingers. I also didnt use as much oil and just flipped them over while they cooked. Didnt like to start with 375 degree oil because it browned the skins so fast the filling didnt have time to warm up. I liked adding extra cream cheese and chopping the crab meat as well so its a smoother filling.... also to kick up the flavor I added more soy sauce minced garlic and Worcestershire sauce. I also added red pepper flakes & minced garlic to a small dish of soy sauce to dip in as the restaurant did. Delicious. These are a huge hit with everyone who tastes them! I ask my boyfriend what he wants for dinner and he says \"you know I want those wontons!\" Reccomended that my mom make them because they're such a snap. Great recipe thanks!",

One of the other girls brought Cream Cheese Wontons from a local Chinese resturant and most people prefered mine!! I sort of halved the recipe on my own and used about a 1/4 of the waterchestnuts (not a big fan) but the crunch they gave really added something. I cheated when it came to shaping them because I have a wonton press. Don't own a deep frier or a thermometer to test the oil but I fried them in 1/2 in of peanut oil in a high sided skillet over medium heat and it worked out fine. Very easy!! I also baked some in a mini muffin pan with the edges of the wonton wrappers sticking up in the air- they were OK (2 people actually prefered them this way)- I think I prefer my grease! I will definatly make these again! I may experiment with the recipe and try making a batch that has some kick to it. Thanks!!",
