Third rule of beer batter: You DO NOT need to sift the flour and don't over-whisk it. A few lumps actually makes for a better texture. Fourth and most important rule of beer batter: It is important to choose the correct beer according to what you are going to cook. As any ingredient ranges in texture and taste, so does beer.",

I came across this one and my first thought was \"no egg?! how?!\" I was so wrong. It doesn't need anything else. I seasoned the fish before I dropped them into the batter with small amounts each of salt pepper garlic powder and paprika. The batter is very thick and lumpy which concerned me at first but I followed the directions letter for letter and it was excellent. My fish was so light and crispy I wanted to cry. We had some leftover fish so the next day I placed the cold cooked fish on a baking rack and popped them in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes or so. They crisped up well. I'm so happy to have found the perfect beer batter!!",
