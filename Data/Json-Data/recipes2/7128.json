I prepared as the recipe stated, but, seasoned the pork chops with a light dusting of salt and plenty of fresh cracked pepper. I also sauteed some mushrooms in with the onions and garlic.   I opted to use the Swanson's beef stock instead of the broth and it gave great depth of flavor.   The pork chops were moist and very tender and the gravy thickened perfectly.  I would rate the recipe easily a 4-1/2 star recipe.   To make a full five star recipe for me though, I would probably add some additional seasoning to the gravy like fresh thyme or a touch of sage and I do think you should season your pork chops before searing.  Go light on the salt though until you taste your gravy.  I served with garlic mashed potatoes & roasted asparagus.  Overall, a great recipe!",

The chops cry out for some seasoning however; I chose Montreal Steak Seasoning but there are many that would be good. Also be careful not to overcook these it doesn t matter how delicious they MIGHT have been had you not cooked the heck out of them. If you have a thermometer use it the current rule of thumb for proper cooking temperature is 145 degrees and it is very easy to surpass that. We enjoyed this no nonsense simple American comfort food.",
