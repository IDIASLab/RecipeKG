Instead of using water to make the dressing thinner, I would suggest just adding olive oil or more buttermilk to prevent the dressing having a bland taste. I also think putting the dressing in the fridge for 8 hours is not obligatory, though it probably tastes better if you do so. Tarragon would also go great with this salad dressing.",
