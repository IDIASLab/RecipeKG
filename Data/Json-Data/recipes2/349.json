Sprayed with cooking spray before baking and turned them after 5-6 minutes.  Delicious.  I can imagine how great they are fried!!!  They did come out crisp in the oven, and had such a great flavor.  My base ravioli was a sausage and spinach filled one.  Great recipe Michele @ Flavor Mosiac!",

The kids were confused why I was giggling over the stove until they had to just ask LOL. totally watch these closely. And make sure to pay attention on timing. They expand in the frying process and looking like coated Stay-puff marshmallow man from the movie Ghostbusters. While I was entertained in the process of the making the recipe, my kids devoured these completely gone. The RITZ crackers give these such a light wonderful yet crisp texture and it was a rather pleasing recipe. Will make again.",
