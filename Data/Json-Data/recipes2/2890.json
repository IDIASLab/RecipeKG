I used Tex Mex cheese on top, which is a combination of chedder and jack.\n\nOmitting the milk makes it much less soupy.  It will also firm up more if you let it sit for at least 10 minutes before serving.\n\n",

I made the sauce exactly as written though I reserved about 1/3 of the cheese to sprinkle on top and I put the bread crumbs (actually croutons that I put through the food processor) on top of that. It was delicious- even better than I expected. Don't omit the mustard- it adds a nice flavour without being recognizable as mustard. Great recipe whether you use it as written or as a starting point like I did.",
