The meat should cook slowly for a minimum of 4 hours--cooking longer will just make it more tender. It sounds like a LOT of garlic, but no one has ever complained that it tasted too garlicky.  Serve with brown mustard on rye or kaiser rolls. Can also add cole slaw to the sandwich for a uniquely delicious sandwich.",

I then removed the meat (which fell apart) and added 3 pounds quartered new potatoes, 2 pounds baby carrots (cut in half) and an onion. I let that cook for 20 minutes and then added a head of cabbage. I cooked an additional 15 minutes. Then I removed the veggies and made a gravy out of the leftover stock using a slurry of stock and corn starch. This recipe was a huge hit last night for our St. Patrick's Day get together. Very authentic tasting and the peppercorns get soft as they cook, so when you bite into one, you get a nice kick without being overly powerful or chipping your teeth. This will be our annual tradition!",

We toasted the rolls, added swiss cheese and home made thousand island dressing from this site--Delicious! Will definitely be going to this one a lot through the colder months especially.  Glad we did 2 briskets, cause one certainly would not have been enough.  Thanks!",

Leaving out the beer and peppercorns is eliminating a great deal of flavor, so I'm not surprised that you said it was lacking in flavor.  If you're worried about the alcohol, it cooks off and leaves behind the hops, yeast, etc. that give beer its flavor and these are imparted into the meat.",
