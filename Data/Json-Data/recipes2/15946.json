Since there are varieties of goat cheese that range from mild to pungent and from fresh to aged the recipe as written leaves a lot a wiggle room. Like saying use a half a cup of cow cheese. And in this recipe that's okay because it's hard to mix potatoes cheese and smoked pork without coming up with something that tastes wonderful. I made it with asiago new potatoes and pancetta because that's what I had on hand. Using maple bacon and sharp cheddar would make it love letter to Vermont. Someone mentioned using feta I think which would make it more delicate and I'd probably pair that with Canadian bacon. Onions or scallions can be substituted for leeks. Oregon Golds for a softer texture Reds for a firmer one. And that's what I like about this recipe. It's all good.",

Used a bag of baby tri-color potatoes (purple red and yellow) from Trader Joe's. To the reviewer wondering what size of potatoes to use I used potatoes that were probably 4-5 inches long the last time I made this and it seemed to work well.",

The cheddar would take away numerous levels of depth from the amazing flavor combinations in this beautiful gratin. If your taste buds aren't refined enough for goat cheese or you dont have it on hand dont waste your time. This is one of the best recipes I have found on this site My ONLY complaint is that it doesnt make nearly enough. I am bringing this to Thanksgiving dinner this year it is sure to be a hit.",

First I didn't have any bacon so I left that out and sauteed 2 leeks and a shallot in a combo of butter and olive oil. Then I sliced a peeled apple very thinly and threw that in with the leeks and shallot. Next I used 6 purple potatoes sliced them really thin and coated them with flour. Then I threw them in with the leek/shallots/apples. I don't know if I used too much flour or what but the mixture was still very thick even after adding a half cup of milk I ended up using about a cup and a quarter of milk. Then I added cheddar cheese mixed it up really well put it in a casserole dish topped with breadcrumbs and baked at 400 for about 35 mins. MMMM Good! Thanks for the recipe Stacey!",
