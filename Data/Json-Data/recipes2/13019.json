I used fat free sweetened condensed milk, sugar free CHEESECAKE pudding and a mix of fat free evaporated milk and fat free half-n-half. The almonds are optional, I did not add them as my husband does not like almonds. I do NOT have a ice cream freezer, I combined the ingredients and poured it into a freezer friendly container. After it firmed up, I scooped it out and ran it through the blender until smooth, then poured it back into dixie cups to make freezer pops (once semi-solid, I inserted popsicle stick in the middle of each filled dixie cup). I was worried that the ice cream would be too sweet because of the sweetened condensed milk and the instant pudding but it really wasn't. We all enjoyed them, even my husband who isn't a fan of banana-flavored anything. My mind is already working on a spin-off recipe making this into a Banana Bread Ice Cream Pops.",

I only had a 2L ice cream maker so I used about 1 - 1.5 cups ripe mashed bananas to top off to the 2L. I used 4 cups of whipping cream 1 cup 2% milk and I made a mistake and instead of getting plain sweetened condensed milk I got dulce de leche version - and a yummy mistake!!! I mixed all very well using my kitchen aid. DELICIOUS!!!!",
