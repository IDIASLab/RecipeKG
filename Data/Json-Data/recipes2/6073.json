I used dried herbs because I was too impatient to wait until I went to the store. Thanks for the recipe!",

Instead, I get a nice loaf of italian or french bread and slice it up, put butter and parmesan cheese on it and toast it.  I use beef broth in place of the chicken broth and I also add two cans of fire roaasted tomatoes.  I cook some elbow pasta and add that to my soup.  I then top it all off in the bowl with the parmesan cheese and serve it with the toasted bread.  ",
