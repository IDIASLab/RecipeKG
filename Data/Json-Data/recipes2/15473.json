I didn't really like these.  Firstly, these absolutely do not need 1 HOUR to cook.  By 45 mins mine were done, and dry at that. Also, if you're going to simmer them for 4 HOURS, there's little need to cook them in the first place, much less fully-cooked!  I tried these after they were baked and didn't like them. I've had frozen meatballs that tasted better - and are cheaper than making your own.  Secondly, and I've already mentioned this, but who simmers sauce with meatballs for 4 HOURS?  This recipe means that you have to start this at noon, so that it's ready by dinnertime.  In today's society, this doesn't work for the modern family. I'm a bachelor myself and I'm not hanging out all day babysitting my stovetop hoping that these bland things would be better after simmering for 4 hours. There are better recipes out there, and if I don't find one on here I'm going to create my own. \"Italian Meatballs\" indeed!!",

I cut the recipe in half, reduced the spices and bread crumbs (about 2 tsp. each of the spices, 3/4 C crumbs, 1/2 package onion soup), and added 1 egg.  I then browned the meatballs on the stovetop and simmered them for about 20 minutes in two bottles of spaghetti sauce.  YUM!  I'm not sure why you would want to simmer meatballs for 4 or 5 hours - 20 minutes worked out well for me.  Whole thing took 45 minutes to make.",

I guess your family didn't cook like this when you were little!  Good Italian meatballs are cooked first (oven or stovetop, although 1 hour is a bit long) before they're plopped into the sauce to simmer all day on the stove.  The sauce permeates the meatballs and just adds to their flavor. They can certainly be cooked quickly and served with store-bought spaghetti sauce, but meatballs just get better and better if they're allowed to simmer in the sauce for several hours.  (They're fantastic cooked a day or two ahead, too!  My meatballs will be served to the Firefighters in two days.  They've just come out of the oven and are sitting in my sauce where they will cool to room temperature and go in the fridge till Monday.  Reheating them will be fabulous!)  ",

I find using dry bread crumbs in meatballs tends to make them hard as a rock so I moisten them with half cup of milk (stir well) before adding to the meat mixture and they turned out very moist. One hour in the oven was far too long even though I make BIG meatballs. They all burned on the bottom. Not a bad recipe just needs some tweaking.",

I halved the recipe and changed: Parsley to Italian Seasoning Garlic to Garlic Salt I also added salt and pepper pretty heavily. Halving the recipe gave me about 15 meatballs a pretty decent sized ones at that. I simmered them with sauce for 30 minutes and even before the simmering the meatballs were not overly dry or crumbly however I will suggest you add 1 egg to the mix. This is a good recipe simply because it is so easy to change ingredients as you go and can alter to taste. I'm keeping this one on file:)",

DO NOT PUT THEM IN THE OVEN FOR AN HOUR! I only had mine in the oven for about 30 minutes and they probably needed only 25 minutes. No need to simmer for 4 hours...30 minutes is all you need.
