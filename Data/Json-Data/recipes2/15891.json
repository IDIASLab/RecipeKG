I started with 2 T of olive oil in the bottom of a small skillet then added 1 lb of Jenni-O frozen turkey. I seasoned the meat with onion powder garlice powder and Lawrey's seasoning salt. I drained the meat once it was cooked through. I chose not to pre cook my veggies and used egg roll wrappers instead of doubling won ton wrappers. These turned out moist full of flavor and great crunch! Even after doubling the recipe I had no left overs! We will definitly be making these again.",

This time I made them, I used a bag of coleslaw mix, and I shredded an extra carrot to go into them.  I've also used regular ginger powder instead of buying ginger root since that's what I've had on hand. I put the ginger in to taste.  I also added in salt, a little bit of garlic, onion powder, and several dashes of soy sauce and worcestershire sauce.  Unfortunately I thought I had green onions, but didn't have any so I had to leave them out.  They still tasted fine without them.  In making these egg rolls twice I've learned that over seasoning them is better than under seasoning them.  Don't be afraid to really spruce up the filling with spices and seasonings.  Next time I'm going to go a little bolder with the flavor.\n**A forewarning:  DO NOT STUFF THE WONTONS UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO FRY THEM.  The wrappers will get wet and not fry properly if they sit for too long.**",
