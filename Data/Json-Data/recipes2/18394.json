For me milk chocolate would have ruined this recipe. I wouldn't change a thing. As an added benefit the darker the chocolate the better it is for you health-wise.",

That would be the cause of my failure both the curdling and the thinness. Half and half NOT a reccomended substitute. This didn't turn out at all for me. First of all adding the orange juice to my heavy cream managed to make it go sour and start to have little clumps in it. Then when I added the chocolate it melted but you could still see the white globs from the cream. The texture seemed grainy and yet it was quite thin. There also was not much orange flavor and overall it didn't seem sweet enough to me.",
