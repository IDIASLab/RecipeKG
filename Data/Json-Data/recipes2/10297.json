Most importantly the meal was delicious healthy and relatively low calorie. I made a couple of substitutions - I used the diced tomatoes with the oregano basil and garlic seasoning and I added three cloves of minced garlic and a dash of red pepper flakes. Rather than green beans I substituted canned artichoke hearts. Whole wheat ziti worked as well as rotini. Instead of boneless chicken breasts I used boneless skinless thighs and skipped the croutons. It was very satisfying with a tossed salad on the side - crusty bread would be delicious to mop up some of the sauce. Skillet Chicken Parmesan is an easy dish that will be in my weekday rotation.",
