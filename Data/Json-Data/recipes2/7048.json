As the recipe author states you ll need to adjust the amount of kefir to oatmeal to suit your own preference. In my case I ended up adding quite a bit more kefir. I did use vanilla kefir (what I had on hand) and I think it only enhanced the flavor. Thanks for the recipe John Tobin. This was very good and a treat for breakfast today.",

Through my experiments with soaking oats overnight I've found that when using a thicker \"liquid\" (in this case kefir) you need at LEAST a 1 to 1 ratio if not more. Using less it will be very thick and solid. I always end up adding a bit more water in the morning as well. Great combo though I often soak in almond milk or yogurt but the kefir was great! I used vanilla flavored so didn't need any honey. Maple syrup would be fantastic too in place of the honey!",
