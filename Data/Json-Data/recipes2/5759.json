Win-win. We are entertaining our great-nephews and they requested these again the next night and declared them their favorite dessert. One preferred chocolate graham crackers/choc mint ice cream and the other used regular graham crackers and cookies and cream ice cream. The 2nd time they didn't even want me to melt the chocolate. 5 stars from Aunt Mary for an easy dessert and 5 stars from the kids because it was fun and yummy.",
