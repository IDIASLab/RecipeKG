This recipe was perfect. The only changes I made were to skip the melted butter and just grease the baking dish with a tablespoon of butter and I reduced the remaining recipe by half for an 8\" square baking dish. The Jack cheese is essential to the flavor. I made it once with mozzarella and found that it was a bit too bland; but either Jack or Swiss gives it a nice more-than-just-eggs kick. It makes a pretty dish and slices very neatly. I will make it often.",
