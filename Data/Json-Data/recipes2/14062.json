A few changes to accomodate what I had on hand: I had no cream so instead I used 2% milk so after melting the butter I added a few pinches of flour to ensure I'd have a thicker sauce. I used regular black pepper and threw in some crushed red pepper for kick and left out the nutmeg. Whole family enjoyed this and I love how easy and quick it was to throw together. Thanks!",

We got about 4 and a half servings out of it. Also it made more sense to me to just cook the bacon in the same pasta pot right before making the sauce worked well and added some flavor. As another reviewer said used 2% milk and added a little flour but I don't think the flour was really necessary as it would have been plenty thick. Also put in some sauteed mushroom and onion. Tasted great. Good versatile recipe will certainly use again.",
