F oven until a meat thermometer reached 162 degrees knowing that the temp would rise to 165 while the meat was resting (that's about 45 minutes or until juices run clear.) It was good but lacked complexity. I will make it again but like other reviewers will use less mayo next time for a stronger chile flavor. I was glad I had made homemade guacamole to go with it because it was best when topped with the guac.",
