Much like bacon adding smoke or honey flavored almonds to a salad often makes it better and unquestionably did so in this case. We separately folded in some mayo with a small amount of pea mixture to do a taste test. It tasted okay but we wanted a healthier and lighter tasting dressing than all mayo. We combined 1 part mayo w/ 1 part Greek low-fat plain yogurt which was mixed w/ a little Pinot Grigio Italian wine vinegar (or white vinegar) Dijon mustard powdered stevia and salt/white pepper to taste. We very much enjoyed this lighter version pea salad. Thank you PHILHERB.",

Reality is this is a very basic pea salad that has a little twist with the smoked almonds but there is an enormous amount of ways you can create pea salad.
