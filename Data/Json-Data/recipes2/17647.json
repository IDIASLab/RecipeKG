Pros: includes veggies (with room for lots more), pretty healthy, unique way to cook ahi. Cons: overall taste is bland (if you use recipe as-is).\n\nI think a necessary ingredient to add here is dijon mustard, to enhance the flavor. A little Worcestershire sauce will help as well. \n\nOverall -- C+. Give it a try and determine the changes you'll want to make for yourself.",

I made sure to buy some nice pieces of tuna and did not sub packaged albacore (although you mince it anyway, not all parts of a tuna-or kinds of tuna- taste the same, just like any other animal). I think I may disagree with the reviews that call this bland. It is a burger after all and should be served with accompaniments like any other burger. Taking that into consideration it is very flavorful. I minced everything by hand and it held together perfectly. Not sure that it wouldn't seem mushy to me if done in a processor. Every time I make patties I either refrigerate or freeze them for a little while to help the flavors meld and help them stick together. I love another reviewers suggestion of mixing a mayo/chinese chili sauce spread:) Definately going to try that! One more thing....these are four very large servings, you could probably serve 6 easily.",

Instead I add chinese fishcake as a binder, grated carrot, minced mustard green cabbage, chopped green onions, garlic clove, fresh grated ginger, a little sesame oil, soy sauce, salt and black pepper. I cook the mustard cabbage down and cool it before adding it to the Ahi mixture. I put some of the Ahi into a food processor and grind the Ahi up.(Sometimes, I do add a 1/2 block of extra firm tofu to the Ahi mixture). I mix everything together. When I make them into patties I put them into the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes. I heat a large skillet with a little sesame oil and heat up the pan to medium high heat. I put the Ahi patties into a skillet, fry them about 3 minutes on each side, until golden brown. I serve them with rice and soup. Very tasty!",
