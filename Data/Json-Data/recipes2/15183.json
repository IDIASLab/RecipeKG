                "reviewBody": "Maple fudge is hard to make, that's for sure, but this recipe will work as it's close to one I've made.  I went through a lot of maple before getting it right. \n\nThe recipe I've used is 2 cups maple syrup (not pancake syrup), 1/2 cup light (table) cream, and a pinch of salt.  That's it.\n\nYou have to get the temperature high enough, near 240F.  Coating the side of the pan with butter will help prevent boilover.  Don't stir it while it cooks.\n\nRemove the pan from the heat and let it cool to 110F.  Don't stir.\n\nUsing a wooden spoon mix for about 3-4 minutes.  If you don't mix it enough it won't set up, and if you mix it too much it will seize in the pan, becoming a hard mass almost instantly.  I've erred both ways.  It will look less glossy when it's ready.\n\nTurn the fudge into the pan and let it sit.  And that's it.  I think maple fudge is harder to make than other fudges.  There is a lot less room for error with this recipe, so if you're not just fiddling around for fun (and you'd be upset if you lost a few dollars worth of syrup) then try something more likely to succeed.",

I made some for Christmas goodie bags and brought the leftovers for Christmas dinner and everyone went crazy over it. Interestingly I came upon a candymaking book from the 1950's or 60's which has this original recipe without the granulated sugar. That makes me want to try it withoug the sugar but based on the reviews I think I'd just be wasting 2 cups of nice Grade B syrup. When I find the book again I'll compare the directions and see if that's where the problem is.",

I make killer chocolate fudge and peanut butter fudge so it's not me I swear!:) It was this sticky taffy-like glop. I think it ruined my mixer the taffy spun up the beaters and into the holes where the beaters are inserted. Switched to a wooden spoon and got a sore shoulder!!
