The sauce is neither too weak nor overpowers the fish. Also it seems like the milk tenderizes the fish and mellows out the flavor slightly. Serve this with some rice pilaf and roasted veggies and it looks like a very fancy meal without lots of fuss. Thanks for this recipe!!! My family has eaten this a few times already and have made sure to save it.",
