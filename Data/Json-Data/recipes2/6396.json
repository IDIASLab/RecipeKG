The texture is so smooth and velvety but I couldn't eat the whole thing (even though I would have liked to) because it does have a lot of oil in it. It got quite hard from being in the fridge for a while so you might want to leave it out to soften. UPDATE: I like to make half the recipe and after mixing add 1/2 cup finely shredded coconut and 1/2 sliced almonds. Then I shape these into balls and refrigerate. These melt quickly but they are so good!",
