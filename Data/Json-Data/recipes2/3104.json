Tomato and basil are a classic combination and when paired with fresh mozzarella you have something so simple and so delicious you could make a meal out of this all by itself! The addition of the spinach is not only delicious, but is good for you too! I like to add a bit of sea salt along with fresh cracked black pepper. I NEVER refridgerate this and if you want to add a little pizzaz add some thin sliced red onion or spinkle with a bit of red pepper flakes- perfect served with Italian bread and a nice wine!",

I kicked it up a notch by adding thinly sliced red onion used cherry tomatoes some slivered almonds(the kind thats used for salad toppings)and slices of roasted chicken with the spinach. I didn't have mozzarella so used feta. I also added garlic basil oregano salt & pepper and about a ts of sugar to my dressing. It was fantastic. My daughter threw in some honey roasted macadamia nuts in her salad (instead of almonds)and it was even better.",

Also I made this into a tossed salad unlike instructions speciify. Well I decided to \"splurge\" and actually buy fresh mozzarella - maybe I'm too cheap.:D And after having it for the first time in a long time I actually decided that I like the \"cheap\" stuff better. The Polly-O brand of mozzarella is the best! It is soft but has a great flavor. To the salad I also added some dried basil along with the fresh. I love basil & also thought that it helped disperse flavor evenly. One funny thing is that due to the balsamic vinegar the mozzarella looked almost like mushrooms once everything was tossed.:) I added some extra EVOO after deciding that I used too much vinegar. I made this then refrigerated it overnight and the spinach wilted nicely.",
