Its a recipe with a lot of trial and error until you find the best balance between everything in the dish... Fire roast the peppers and place them in a clear plastic bag to let them steam so the skin will be easier to take off. Once the skin is off try not to rinse them because you will lose flavor. Chop them up the same size as tomatoes.Mince as much garlic as you want and cook in about 3 tblspns of cooking oil with 2-3 tomatoes if you are using 5 peppers. Salt pepper paprika and let all ingredients simmer for about 20 min.( You can add spice by roasting a hot pepper and chopping it up as well)",

Put 2 tbsp of oil peel and chop 1 whole garlic head finely Place garlic in pan and start cooking add salt pepper in the meantime take 2 large cans of diced tomatoes and drain them as much as possible in a colander squeeze to get the most water out of it. Add tomatoes to the garlic on low fire Add 3 or 4 grilled and peeled green bell peppers. Once the water is evaporated it may take 2 to 3 hours Add the secret ingredient that is powdered dried red bell pepper hard to find but can be found online put the powder in about 4 tablespoon of Virgin Olive oil and pour into the casserole. Put fire on high for about 3 minutes stirring constantly. Take it off the stove and let it cool. It turned out great and made a whole batch which can be frozen.",
