        "description": "This colorful recipe is a modified version of my mom's chili that I grew up on. It is called 4 way because of the four steps to making your plate: spaghetti first, then crushed crackers, next cheese, and finally the chili. I added the peppers, but the recipe is still great (and faster) without them. To heat things up, just add hot sausage and/or hot chili seasoning packs instead of mild. It is an off-beat recipe that I am sure you will love!",

I cut the recipe in half therefore it called for only 1 can of Stewed Tomatoes. This needed a lot more than 1 can. I am wondering if Josh meant for us to also follow the directions of the chili seasoning and use those liquids. In any event I ended up using a jar of salsa too. What we really liked was the combination of the beef and sausage.",

Like reviewer \"Aspiring Chef Rita\" I thought it needed more liquid. I added one more can of tomatoes (used Rotel with peppers mild) and still wanted more so dumped in the 1/2 container I had on hand of fresh salsa. I also did not drain the tomatoes or beans in order to have the liquid. Then it needed a little more spice so I just sprinkled in some additional chili pepper. One note...I just picked up pinto beans per the instructions. I ended up with light colored beans. I didn't think this was as pretty as a result. Go with the dark red beans for appearance. Yummy Josh thanks.",

Now that we can buy fresh tamales you'd think we'd use them but it's just not the same taste or nostalgia-wise. My only problem with your recipe was that I didn't know how many crackers to use. A regular box measures serving size by number of crackers and grams not ounces. But we all did enjoy your four-way version. Try mine some time. I'll bet your family loves your cooking.
