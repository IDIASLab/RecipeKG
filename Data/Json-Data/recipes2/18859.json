I only used half the amount of Italian dressing and it was still just too tangy/sour. Also it seemed the lack something (maybe beans?) and the green chilies were just too much. I was really hoping to like this recipes but just didn't. It was just odd. If you are looking for a good dip I would try something with an olive oil base with added vinegar for a kick. There is a great recipe on this website if you look up \"black bean salsa\" that has these ingredients in it and it just tastes better but is comparable to this recipe as far as some of the ingredients. I will not be making this particular recipe again.",
