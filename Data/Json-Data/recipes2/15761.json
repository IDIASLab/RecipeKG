I took the advice of others that said that this did not make very much frosting, and doubled the recipe, which made enough to generously frost a 9\" X 13\" pan of walnut brownies.  YUM!!  I will certainly make this again.",

I didn't see the necessity for the evaporated milk - I preferred to use half and half.  I used this to top \"Simply Fudgy Brownies\" (that recipe is pretty darn good too), frosting them while they were still warm.  This frosting will make its way back to my kitchen again, I'm sure!",
