I grate the fresh ginger - lots - and press the garlic so there aren't intimidating chunks of either just lots of flavor. I cook the onions first in the wok with hot oil pretty much to smithereens then set aside. Then brown the sirloin strips in the wok (I get my grocery to run the steak through the tenderizer - then you don't have to worry about them getting tough). Add the rest of the ingredients and toss until hot. My oldest son and I love these and could eat them all the time but my husband is snobbish about them so we only feast on them when he's not around.

The flavor was still there though so it's all good. I don't have chili oil and subbed sweet chili sauce--just a bit since it is quite a strong taste. I like all the flavors in this and served on Syrian bread that I rolled kind of like a burrito. Thanks for the recipe Sunny!",

Cooked all the veggies chili and sauce with the meat until about medium browned the hoggie rolls added the ing. and topped with provolone cheese till melted. We loved it. Thanks for the post.",

I split hoagie buns put provolone cheese on the bottom and heated them in the oven so the buns were warm and the cheese was melted. I then filled them with the meat mixture and added just a little more cheese and broiled. The gingerroot gave these sandwiches a nice twist. Will definitely make again.",

I liked this sandwich quite a bit but I love spicy and I love ginger and this started with my favorites onion and garlic so I was already sold. The family didn't like this so maybe it's too girly (or metro) for their manly man palates of steak and potatoes. I'd eat this again my men voted against this one.",

I chose to put the beef in my crock pot just covered with water added a little bit of diced onion shook out some garlic powder and ginger powder (nothing fresh in my house) skipped the celery (too much work) and chili oil (had none) and splashed in some soy sauce. Cooked it until the meat was done through tasted added more ginger and soy cooked until husband was home and ready to eat. I used sliced french bread (what was on hand) toasted at least enough to be hot placed thinly sliced cheddar on each piece to melt and prevent the bread from getting soggy and strained the beef mixture through a slotted spoon before piling it in between the bread. I added cornstarch to the resultant broth to make a gravy for dipping for my husband. My 2 1/2 year old son liked it and my (picky) husband said the sandwiches were really good and agreed to eat them again. I win! The flavors ended up being mild more of an aftertaste which I liked really well. I rated this 5 stars because it would be really good as written and was very easy to modify/hard to mess up when you don't measure and because the ingredients are every-day sorts of food.
