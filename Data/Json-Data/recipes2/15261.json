I think it might be better to make it in a round loaf of bread and cut it into triangle sections for easier handling. Next time I'll only use 2 tomatoes - 3 was too many. Great olive tapenade!!",

I would suggest no adding the olive oil in step 1 since the olives have plenty of juice (this will keep your bread a bit drier). All in all a tasty filling sandwich that you can make the night before and just grab it for lunch when you leave the house.",

The next morning everyone just had to grab their portion some fruit and a snack and their lunch was ready to go. My husband's co-workers could smell it while he was having lunch and wanted some. The kids' friends at school could smell it and wanted one as well one friend even had a taste of the tapenade and tried to jokingly steal the sandwich from my daughter. The kids and husband all came home raving about how good it was for lunch. I look forward to making this for our trips to the beach with extended family this summer. This recipe is definitely a keeper.",
