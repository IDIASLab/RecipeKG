This was good mind you and I gobbled it down over three days but I just think that it could be even better. Still worth making again and even tweaking a little.",

All you taste is the curry there is no smokiness from the cumin and no other flavors. Everything is over powered with the curry. There is too much onion. Most of the sauce was onion. For it to be similar to a tomato sauce there needs to be more tomatoes. The sauce turns out to be a slightly yellow brown mush that does not look appetizing. The cooking times are inordinately long if I had cooked that chicken for any longer it would have been rubber. There is no way that the mush needs to be simmered either because there is no liquid to cook off and it doesn't need time for the flavors to meld--the curry hides everything.",

The curry and cumin flavours were spot on! Served with Roasted Cauliflower Steaks from this site and some warm naan. will definitely make this again:)",
