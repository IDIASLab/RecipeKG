The basil gives it a nice bit of extra flavor and the garlic - I used five cloves since mine were rather small and we love garlic - that was way too much! 1/3 cup of basil ended up being about 1 oz of fresh after the stems had been trimmed. I also added a bit more olive oil and lemon juice to make it a little less thick and for taste preference. This was great with no-salt pita chips.",

It sure was quick and easy to make.  Raw garlic is quite pungent and I felt 4 cloves was a little too much if you're eating the hummus straight on a pita chip.  It's fine if you're using it as a sandwich spread.  If you pack the basil leaves like the recipe says, you will have plenty of basil flavor; I suspect some cooks didn't do that.  I thought it tasted better the second day.",

I also added one avocado to give it more taste and I drizzled about 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of water to thin and smooth it out in my food processor. Overall it is a good recipe with some tweaking. I would also add more basil for additional taste. We like garlic so I used 4 big cloves. I would make it again with these changes. I like Chef John's recipes they are usually very tasty.",
