First flour the breasts then dip in milk/egg mixture and then seasoned bread crumbs. This will also make a delicious chicken or turkey parmesan. Make sure you split the breasts pound them thin but not paper thin. Layer bottom of pan with tomato sauce place breasts on top top with more sauce and then grated pizza cheese and parmesan cheese. Cover with foil. Bake for about 20 min in 350' oven or until cheese melts and the sauce bubbles. Delicious",

I followed others' advice (dredge in flour dip in egg milk then coat) and fried at medium heat and the pieces turned out beautifully. I didn't bother cutting into strips and I actually liked the presentation better this way (served with couscous and spinach salad as sides). Several changes that I made (mostly due to the lack of ingredient): Instead of Italian seasoning I used dried thyme basil and parsley; instead of regular grated parmasean I only had the \"zesty pepper\" variety (worked great!); and I rubbed the turkey in some onion and garlic powder before coating. One note: this recipe makes way too much breading. Over half of the mixture I made went unused.",

To get the bread crumbs to stick better in this or any other breaded meat recipe mix a good teaspoon of real mayo (not the sweet stuff!!) into the egg and milk mixture. It really helps the \"stick factor.\" (The mayo will look a little lumpy in the egg/milk mixture...don't worry about it...it mixes in better with a stick blender but I've done it more often than not with a fork and it's fine.) Anyway this is a nice quick and delicious dinner with some green veggies and salad. Thanks.",
