They are a little time-consuming to put together but not inordinately and are otherwise simple and easy. I used shallots in the mayonaise mixture instead of regular onion. I am making them again for my sister's wedding shower next month and I think I will use fresh steamed asparagus. There's nothing better than fresh asparagus and canned can be just too mushy. Most kids wouldn't go anywhere near these.",
