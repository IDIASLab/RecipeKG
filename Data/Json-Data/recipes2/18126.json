I'm not big on the sauce in the recipe, however. I paired these rolls with the Indonesian Satay recipe from this site. That recipe included instructions for a peanut sauce which was WONDERFUL with the spring rolls. I have never worked with rice wrappers before. I was suprised at how pliable they were. I completely soaked the wrappers to make them soft but they never ripped. Once I got the hang of wrapping the filling it was easy. I did use small wrappers and could only fit 1/12  of the filling in each, therefore ended up making 12 little bites. I also added some bean sprouts for extra crunch. Fantastic! Really scrumptous and so healthful. Not to mention one of the most fun recipes I have ever made!",

Most fresh spring roll wrappers need only a quick rinse on both sides and set about 60 seconds. I find this worked well on this recipe as soaking resulted in wrappers that were too flimsy and weak to roll.",

I also maranated then steamed the shrimp.  The maranade is simple, I used lemon juice and garlic with a smidgin of olive oil.  I then took my steamer and steamed the raw shrimp till the shells were pink, around 5 min.   Instead of the dipping sauce which I wasn't fond of I used hoisen sause with crushed peanuts on top.  WAYYYY better.  Also for added spice I had a side of crushed chili sause.\n",
