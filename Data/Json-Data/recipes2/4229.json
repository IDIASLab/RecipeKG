I also used the lite version of soy sauce to cut back on the salt. I didnt have black pepper so I used white pepper.. I didnt use a whole tablespoon just about between 1/2 and 3/4 tbs. It smelled the rest of the soup so i added more garlic powder, minced and about 2 cups of the broth mixture. I accidently added a lil too much red pepper than i wanted so i scooped some out and cooked the chicken in the soup and used one small onion. Will definately make again and I will try to thicken it with arrowroot and water since most hot and sour soups at the restuarants are thick.",
