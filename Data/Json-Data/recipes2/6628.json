I used like 4 cloves of garlic and I think you could cut back on the butter by half. This is really good I think next time I will omit the flour and maybe use cornstarch? I think that would work better. or maybe not use it at all. It sort of tastes like alfredo sauce on fish but that is fine with me:)",

As there were no crawfish but plenty of fresh live lobster we substituted lobster for the crawfish and sea scallops for the canned crab and it was wonderful! The only suggestion I have is deboneing the fillet so that you don't need to mess with the bones while enjoying this meal. We served it with basati rice and fresh corn on the cob. YUM! Thanks Carolyn!",

The sauce was fantastic on it's own and I thought the finished product would be just as great but for some reason the finished product was not that good. It was kind of washed-out in flavor. I can't imagine that using the seabass would be any different as it is a thicker fish than talapia. Was hoping great flavor for this one but not sure if I'll try again. The sauce was good enough to eat with a spoon though. Come to think of it the sauce would make a great filling for crepes.",
