I saw no need to bake the fish I kept everything on the stovetop and it came out beautifully. I grated more ginger added more wine and cream and a touch more soy sauce. I used sole for my fish which cooks very quicky. Seared seasame was wonderful. After flipping the fish once I turned the heat to low covered the pan briefly while I blended the sauce. I turned the heat on hi again afterwards and poured some of the sauce on the fish and let it simmer for a few seconds. Then I turned the heat off completely and covered the pan so that the fish could sit in the warm sauce while we ate our udon beforehand.",

I used basil instead of shiso but next time will just omit it and add more wasabi as per another poster's suggestion (I only added a tiny bit next time will add at least a tsp). Don't skimp on the ginger in the sauce either. We liked it so much we're making it again with tuna tomorrow. Serve with steamed green beans sauteed with yellow bell pepper and toasted sesame seeds.

If you are having trouble finding shiso leaves, then go to any half way decent sushi restaurant, offer to buy 4 leaves, and they will more than likely give them to you.  Basil and/or mint do not make good substitutes, you would be better off simply omitting the shiso.  The sauce is basically a beurre blanc sauce with a Japanese influence. Muscadet is the traditional wine used for beurre blanc sauce, but any dry acidic white wine will do.  I usually use a Sauvignon Blanc with a very nice acidity to it, and I never use a wine for cooking that is not good enough to enjoy on its own.            I like my beurre blanc to have a very high acidity to it, like this one does, but for those who don't like a very acidic sauce, I might recommend cutting back a tiny bit on the lemon juice.          Next time I will try cooking the mahi mahi in olive oil, instead of canola, as I think that will improve on the flavor.",
