The garlic adds a really nice touch kind of a slight hint of extra taste in the back ground. I wouldn't normally use this much butter or cheese when I make this but I did this time and boy was I surprised how much better it was. The cheese and butter get gooey and make a sort of sauce. My daughter and I will have this as a full meal when it is just the two of us but will also make a great side dish to chicken. Thanks Paula you improved on a dish I already loved.",

Coming from two garlic lovers we found this dish to have way too much garlic in it 1 tablespoon of minced garlic is plenty. As well you could easily reduce the amount of cheese to say...2/3 cup. We will definitely make this again but reduce the amount of cheese and garlic. I made this again reduced the amount of cheese and garlic - and when I drained the pasta I left a small amount of pasta water clinging to the noodles made the sauce even creamier!",

If you like the taste of romano cheese this pasta will suit you well. Others may not take to the strong sharpness of this cheese. I slightly undercooked the pasta then set it aside. I reserved a little of the pasta water while I continued preparing this dish. I thought the cooking method of tossing 2T of RAW garlic into the hot pasta would not suit well with me so I chose to sautee it in almost a 1/4 cup of butter not 1/2 of a cup along with 2T of olive oil. I added just 1T of minced garlic to the skillet. Once the garlic started to cook in the butter and olive oil I threw in the pasta then tossed to coat. I then added 3/4 cup of grated romano cheese and mixed to make sure everythiing was evenly distributed with cheese. I turned off the burner and added a little of the reserved pasta water to wet it slightly and to give just a little creamy \"sauce\". I topped it off with a little more romano cheese and a sprinkle of fresh minced italian flat leaf parsely. I loved the sharpness from the romano cheese. It was nicely melted in the pasta. I am glad that I did not add the full amount of 2T raw garlic as I know it would have been overpowering for me. I would prepare this dish again only with my modifications. This was served along with \"Ciabatta\" bread from this site as well as a small tossed green salad.",
