The addition of orange juice really complemented the berries and banana and the yogurt made it creamy without having excess tang as yogurt often does to a smoothie. It was a little thin after blending so I did add more ice to reach the consistency I like and bumped up just a bit the amount of strawberries and banana. This is my first time using Truvia and what a pleasant surprise to find no aftertaste as you often have with reduced-calorie sweeteners. Florida's peak strawberry crop will be in season very soon and I feel certain many of these smoothies will be made during the next few months. This is a star nutritionally but it's going into my Favorites folder simply because it's awesome tasting!",
