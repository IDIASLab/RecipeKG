According to the submitter do use cabernet sauvignon it doesn't have to be expensive but a substitution may not taste the same. Also use regular limes not key limes since they may be bitter. Better if you use flavored sparkling water. All suggestions came directly from the submitter of the recipe. Thank you for a great recipe!",
