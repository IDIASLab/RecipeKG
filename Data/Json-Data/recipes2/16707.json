We doubled the reciped first, put it all in a rice cooker.  Checking it every 10 minutes, we had to add more Orange Juice everytime so I would say we put about 1 cup more than the recipe called for ( doubling anyway ) so put 1/2 cup more for a single serving.  Took roughly 30 minutes to cook and went great with the Gingered Chicken Breast recipe on this site. Enjoy!",
