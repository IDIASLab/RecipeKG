I will make this again but cut the honey way down or use a bit of maple syrup instead. Ripe bananas are pretty sweet to begin with so 3 tbs of honey takes it too far. Also use ground flax instead of flax seeds as the nutrition benefits of flax are only released when the seeds are ground. Steel cut oats can be adapted to this recipe. Keep a parcooked container of steel cuts in the refrigerator to use in place of the quick oats. Still cook as directed and they will turn out great. I love the combination of banana and walnuts in this recipe. Flavor and crunch! Thanks for sharing Sunshine7!",

I tried pecans instead of walnuts - think either would be good.  I did add a bit of brown sugar - maybe next time I'll add a dab of peanut butter to go with that banana!!!  This was easy and quick and I knew exactly what I put in it - as opposed to all those packet-mix oatmeals!!!  You could even do bettter than those packets - you could use this as a base (minus the banana) and add your own peaches and cream, maple and brown sugar, or apples and cinnamon!!!!  Thanks for the great recipe and recipe base!!!!!!!!!  Ten stars!!!",
