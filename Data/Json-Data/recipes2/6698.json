I used two 6oz bags of cooked salad shrimp and did add a 6oz can of white crab meat drained. I also added a 4oz can of diced green chilis and a tablespoon or so of Penzey's Bold taco Seasoning to spice it up a bit. The filling was a bit wet my fault I'm sure with the additions so I had to cook it down quite a bit. But the result was rich and tasty. Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!",

I couldn't find green enchilada sauce at the store I went to so I got regular enchilada sauce and salsa verde and used 1/2 can of the regular and a whole can of the salsa verde. I thought the enchiladas would be bland because of the cream cheese and shrimp but these were really great. Everyone in my family could not say enough good things about them.

I didn't have cilantro so used parsley and used lemon juice instead of lime but I think the original ingredients would be even better. I put about 1/2 cup of shredded Mexican cheese on top before baking as directed. Garnished with sour cream and next time will add olives chopped tomatoes and green onions on top. Yum!",
