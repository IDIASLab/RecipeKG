I used 2-28 oz. cans of italian style diced tomatoes instead of 2-16oz cans. When I previously made the recipe with 2- 16oz. cans and it wasn't saucy enough, plus I didn't drain the tomatoes so it was really watery. I also added Mrs. Dash Table Blend, Parsley, Oregano, Basil, Garlic Powder, Pepper, and Onion Flakes to season the chicken and I added a little bit more to the dish before serving. The additional seasoning made it have more flavor, which was way better then the original recipe.",

My changes; used whole olives sliced in half length wise sprinkled chicken generously with garlic powder and italian seasoning (didn't have garlic herb seasoning) used thin spagetti and used only one can of diced tomatoes (would have been better with two didn't have). I also seasoned to taste with salt and pepper. It's lighter than your normal pasta with sauce and surprisingly flavorful with the little amount of seasoning. Next time I will toss in some fresh garlic and maybe even substitute canned mushrooms and tomatoes with fresh. As is it is very tasty and quick when your in a crunch. I served with bruschetta and green salad. Thanks for sharing Tiffany.",
