This recipe not only offers a completely meat-free bacon, but one that is low in fat and calories. To mimic the intoxicating aroma that we have come to love in the real thing, we used a combination of liquid smoke and paprika to achieve similar results cleverly using rice paper.",

This is one I will have to play with to get the seasoning just right. My husband enjoyed it while I think the spices aren't just right. The one thing I will note is I baked it at 400 for 6 mins and it came out burnt. So I lowered the temp to 350 and baked for 10 mins and it came out perfectly baked. All ovens are different, just keep that in mind. Overall this is one I will play with and perfect to my taste. Thanks for sharing!!",

Lay the paper on the coated cutting board.\n4. Put a coating of seasoning mixture on the paper.\n5. Cut the paper in 1 1/2 inch strips.\n6. Lay on parchment covered cookie sheet.\n7. Crinkle the strip before baking to get a more authentic looking \u201cbacon\u201d. \n8. Bake at 400 for about 6-7 minutes. Keep checking after 6 minutes.",
