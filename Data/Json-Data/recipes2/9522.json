Whenever I have leftover spaghetti I love rewarming the spaghetti in a skillet and after it is warm I'll add the eggs. I prefer to keep the spaghetti in the center most part of the skillet so it is surrounded by the eggs. When it is cooked on the bottom rather than trying to flip it (the eggs are usually still a bit too runny on top to make this an easy flip) I finish it in a pre-heated oven. That way the frittata puffs up somewhat and is cooked all the way through. Make sure you use a skillet that has a bake-proof handle.",
