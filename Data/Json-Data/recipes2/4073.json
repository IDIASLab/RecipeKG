I have no idea if mine was like Smithfield's or not but it was good. I blended finely chopped fresh rosemary with about 1/3 cup olive oil. I let it sit. While the bacon was frying I coated the chops with the oil and rosemary mixture. I suppose for a stronger rosemary flavor letting them sit overnight would have been good but I didn't have time for that this time. I pretty much followed the rest of the recipe as written. My family thought it was very good.",
