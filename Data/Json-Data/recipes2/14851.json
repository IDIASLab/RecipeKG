The recipe is really good as is but I've still made a few changes to suit my family and to accommodate availability of ingredients. Condensed oyster stew is pert near impossible to find in my area so I add an extra can of cream of potato and a medium can of oysters undrained instead. I also add a can of corn drained (frozen works too) and 3-4 medium sized fish fillets; salmon works beautifully for this but I've gotten good results with cod and swai too. Lastly I add a couple tbsp of butter for a little extra richness.",
