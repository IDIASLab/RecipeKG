I would maybe have preferred to have the pasta a little more done and I did think it lacked a little moisture---maybe water from the pasta. Balsamic vinegar does tend to make pasta look a little weird but it does make it taste good. You could always use white balsamic vinegar as an alternative. Thanks thesmiths!",
