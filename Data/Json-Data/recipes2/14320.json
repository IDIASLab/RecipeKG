The last time I made it I removed the still frozen crust from the cheapie pan and put it in my oven safe glass (Pyrex) pie pan.  What a difference!  Crispy and flakey.  My Pyrex pan is a little bigger but during baking the crust molded to fit.  Another tip for ultimate presentation:  Just before baking place thinly sliced cheddar slivers in a starburst pattern in the center of the quiche.  Sprinkle with a dry green herb like dill or thyme.  Beautiful AND delicius!",

Hubby liked it better this way, said \"you can taste the crab better without it\". I didn't think this was bland at all; the flavor of the crab really came through. I added a little salt, pepper and garlic powder, and used 3 eggs and Alpine Lace reduced fat swiss cheese and light mayo. (Prepared this way, it's only 4 points per serving in Weight Watchers.) Good recipe! Thanks!",

No big deal though. I made the quiches the night before the baby shower I was hosting and then just warmed them in a 350 deg. oven for 15 minutes. Everyone raved aboout them.",

My husband ate half the pie and then asked for it again the next night:) It looks like this will be a staple in our house. ok so here is an update: I have made this many times since and do it a bit different now. I add half of an onion chopped finely as well as some cayenne pepper and I use three eggs. Also i chop the crab because i don't like biting into huge chunks. I have also made it many times omitting the crust",

We were pleasantly surprised and pleased by the turnout. I adjusted a little using a refrigerated pie crust that I pre-baked 10 minutes in a 9\" deep dish ceramic pie plate. I follwed other reviewers' suggestions and added an extra egg and a little more milk and cheese. The only addition I made was to add a half cup of chopped scallions. (I also forgot to add the cornstarch and given the outcome I'm not sure what purpose it was supposed to serve.) The flavors here were delicate yet nicely balanced. The addition of the scallions gave a dash of added 'oomph' that we think complemented the flavor of the crab and Swiss without overpowering it. We'll make this again!",
