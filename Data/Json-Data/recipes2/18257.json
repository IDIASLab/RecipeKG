Maybe I did something wrong but I did not like this. My husband who doesn't know it has velveeta in it didn't like it either. It has a weird consistency and wasn't as sweet as traditional fudge. Sorry I think I will stick with the traditional. I didn't even take a pic just threw it in the trash ): Very disappointed I don't see how so many people have raved about fudge with processed cheese in it.",
