I found it easier to make 1/2 batch at a time, and to first put the bread cubes in a large bowl and pour the oil (I substituted 1/4 cup olive oil & 1/4 cup melted margarine) over the cubes and then add the seasoning and mix well, before placing them on the baking pan.  Will definately add this to my list of favorites!",

I had a loaf of Italian bread that was going stale and this recipe was perfect for it.  I used EVOO instead of veg. oil and tossed them instead of just drizzling the mixture over top.  I baked them at 375 instead of 400 and watched them carefully so they didn't burn. I turned them during cooking. So good, I made a second batch and experimented with using a packet of Good Seasons Italian Salad dressing mix plus some minced garlic along with the olive oil.  I think you can mix up just about any combination of herbs, spices, and add in some grated cheese and it'll turn out great! A perfect add-in to salads, soups, casseroles - whatever you can think of...",
