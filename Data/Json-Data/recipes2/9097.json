Considering the price of tahini at the store, I thought it was fair to make it instead (Buying the seeds in bulk or in bags from the health food store is much more cost effective than buying the little jars from the spice section!) Not only that, it probably took me as long to make this as it does to stir the store-bought container when the oil has separated, lol! I feel it needed a pinch of salt to brighten the sesame flavor.  I made just enough tahini for making a garbanzo can's worth of hummus (quartered this recipe).  Look forward to making that tomorrow!",

I do recommend pulsing it at first, and with a rubber spatula, scooping up from the bottom to incorporate all the seeds, then just let the processor run for a couple more minutes.  I don't understand why people had so much trouble with it!  Start with the minimum amount of oil, but if it's too thick, just add a bit more until it gets to the consistency you want.
