The sauce was rich thick and had such depth to it; and it only had the onion and peppers added to it. The Italian sausage was perfect with this dish although I do think that chicken breasts would be delicious too. The polenta was so creamy and velvety and with the added parmesan it was truly delicious! I highly recommend this recipe:-) I will be making this one again and again.",
