Honestly I think my horse might like it more than I did - and I'm a kale fan! Some of the ingredients (e.g. tahini golden raisins smoked slivered almonds) are not cheap & are not things that I have frequent use for - so they will probably sit in the cupboard forever. I did end up adding dried cranberries towards the end of the meal and that was an improvement. I would suggest substituting dried cranberries instead of the golden raisins. I just found it too 'kale heavy' and would be tempted to cut the kale in half & use bok choy or napa cabbage for the balance.",
