First the review: I didn't want to dock the recipe for user error so I will merely take off one star. The reason for this is- due to variances in microwave oven power I think the user should definitely watch the roux toward the end there just to make sure it doesn't scorch. Now on to the painful part of the review... When you read the directions note that it CLEARLY says to use \"a microwave-safe glass bowl\". PLEASE for the sake of your beloved cookware do indeed use a microwave-safe GLASS bowl. I don't care how many other things you have cooked in your trusty plastic microwave-safe bowl... DO NOT be tempted to use it. It will very likely be doomed to the same fate as my cherished bowl. What happened to that bowl was so horrific that I dare not go into details. I assure you though it is on its way to peacefully serving eternity in a landfill while I hold its memory close to my heart. Will I try this recipe again? I don't know... it's just too soon right now.",

My proportions are a little different since I don't need that much roux -- 1/2 cup olive oil to a little less than 1/2 cup flour will make 2-4 cups gravy  - depending how thick you like your gravy.",

She deviates however by taking the roux when it begins to take on it's distinctive copper color and finishes it in the gumbo pot to turn it into the rich dark brown color that adds so much more flavor to the gumbo. There is no substitute for a truly rich dark brown roux. Be aware that you must stir it constantly as it begins to turn dark as it will easily burn at that stage.",
