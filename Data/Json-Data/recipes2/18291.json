A little trick I learned when you are filling a chicken breast is to butterfly the chicken breast first and then pound it to flatten you end up with a much bigger piece of meat to work with. On the edges pound it very thin because when you are rolling and folding the edges in the edges get very thick.",

I added mushrooms and spinach which I sauteed using olive oil. I also sauteed the italian sausage until barely brown; this speeds up the cooking process. To the stuffing mixture I added also about a 1/4 cup of mozzarella and about a teaspoon of minced garlic. Cooking the italian sausage ahead of time cut the cooking time. I only baked this in the oven 25-30 minutes. This recipe is a keeper.",
