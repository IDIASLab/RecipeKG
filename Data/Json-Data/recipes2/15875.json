I prefer to try most of my recipes first before serving them and I was most concerned about this one. Bread cream cheese and bacon? The combination sounded interesting but I was skeptical. Therefore I decided to try it with dinner tonight first. There's not a single one left! Even my boyfriend who shys away from cream cheese unless it is discretly hidden in the dish loved these (not that the cream cheese is very apparent though). Now I have to make another batch for tonight! Great recipe! Thanks for posting this Robyn!",

I used turkey bacon sprayed lightly with olive flavored Pam (since he doesn't eat regular bacon) and chive-flavored cream cheese with a fews drops of tobasco sauce for a little kick. Look forward to making this again with rye or wheat bread. Make sure you flatten the bread well with a rolling pin for the best results. 5 spoons up!!",

I added about 1/2 cup cooked and drained chopped spinach and 1 tablespoon Tastefully Simple Spinach and Herb Mix.  I cut both the bread and bacon into thirds rather than in half.  Also, rolling the bread, as suggested by one reviewer, made it easier.  Do not precook the bacon as some have said.  Adds a step that is not needed- you need the flavor of the bacon and your roll-ups are not at all greasy.  Just drain on paper towels.  Took to a party and were devoured!  Thanks for the recipe.",
