I used the whole tablespoon and it wasn't overpowering. If you don't like liquid smoke this isn't your burger. There's no need to rub with oil or seasoned salt. We used 85/15 burger meat. UPDATE: We've had so many requests for this recipe that we've even had to scale these up to 48 for our own July 4th party and bring these to other people's BBQ's instead of the regularly requested pasta or potato salad!!!",
