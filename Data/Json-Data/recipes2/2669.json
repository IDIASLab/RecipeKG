One concern I had with this recipe was the lack of lobster throughout the dish. The second time I made this dish I used a little more lobster and mixed it into the mac and cheese. In my totally unprofessional and extremely humble opinion the changes I made improved the dish. But I realize everyone's palate and style is different. It just didn't make sense in my mind to have all the lobster on top of,  and none throughout, the dish.",

I made a couple adjustments along the way; I used half n half instead of milk and I added an extra 1/4 cup to ensure the pasta didnt get too dry.  I didn't put it in small dishes to bake, just put it in a large Pirex dish.  I also doubled the panko/parmesan topping to cover the entire dish.

While I waited, he steamed up, cracked and picked some fresh lobster meat for me. I folded it into the mac & cheese, and baked it, according to the recipe. Now, it was good, but it was not wonderful, befitting the fresh lobster meat that went into it. Suffice it to say, I will not waste any more lobster meat, nor foul up any more mac &  cheese, by putting them together. Each is wonderful, in its own realm, but the two are not meant for each other, in my humble opinion.",
