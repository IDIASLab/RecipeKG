I had to make a couple changes to suit my family, so here's what I did --  The cucumber I bought at the store had a really bitter flavor (??? it looked fine!) so I substituted slices of avocado, instead.  Instead of tossing the dressing with the avocado, I just put it in a squirt bottle and drizzled it over the wrap once I had it assembled.  It was DELISH!  My picky family loved it, and I love that this dish can be customized any way you want.  I put out some of our favorite sushi condiments as well (pickled ginger, wasabi for the brave...) and everyone loved it.  I can totally see turning this into a fun party appetizer, by making pinwheels with the ingredients.  Sort of like sushi for those too chicken to try sushi!  I had no problem with canned salmon.  If you get a good quality salmon, it works just fine.  It would be fine with grilled salmon, as well.  Thanks for this recipe!  This is definitely going into frequent rotation at my house!",

A couple of things I'll do differently next time I discovered that I dislike canned salmon so I'd use either fresh or pieces of tuna steak or shrimp - I think the tuna and/or shrimp would work nicely here. Secondly I'd make more of the soy sauce mixture - Loved the taste and felt the wraps could have used more. Thanks for posting the recipe!",

I thought overall the flavor was good but the canned salmon turned me off. I used toasted seeds because that's what I have on hand. Since this is an asian inspired wrap I found it odd being on a flour tortilla. Next time I'll try wrapping it in lettuce. It will highlight the flavors of everything else and be lower in calories.",

I used fresh salmon which I baked with leftover homemade Pad Thai sauce; used brown rice and whole-wheat tortilla; grated the daikon and cuke; used chopped pickled ginger and more wasabi; toasted the sesame seeds; and mixed all ingredients (including the sauce) together. I added a sheet of nori on top of the tortilla spooned in the mix and rolled it all up--delish! I'd also serve this in a bibb/Boston lettuce leaf. Big bonus--not a lot of dishes to clean afterward!",

I went a little crazy with it when I made it because I wanted it to fit with what I had at the time but the results were fantastic--really light but very filling. I julienned cucumber daikon carrots and white onion. I sauted a little gai-lan in peanut oil. Heated the tortilla in the same oil and then proceeded to fry some 1/4 block of tofu (I didn't have any salmon). I layed the julienned veggies and tofu in the tortilla with some green onions (only the greens) split length-wise pickled ginger 1/2 sliced avocado and Sriracha sauce. For the dressing I mixed a teaspoon of the juice from the pickled ginger with the soy sauce rice vinegar wasabi paste sesame seeds the diced whites from the green onions and half a teaspoon of sugar. I spooned the dressing on to the insides before I wrapped it up. I had some left over veggies and dressing so I made a little side salad with it. It was a wonderful and easy lunch that I'll certainly make again. Next time I think I'll add some nori and try it with the salmon.",
