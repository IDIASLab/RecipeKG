It was thick and delicious and you really taste the melon. The only reason I give this 4 stars is because of the nutmeg. I never remember the one spice it is that I hate until I taste it and of course it's nutmeg. I don't think I'll forget again. Next time I will omit it but for those of you who have no problem with nutmeg this will be a five star refreshing soup for you. Thanks for the great recipe.",
