We traditionally have a cocktail hour which is usually a chocolate martini or apple. But this one will be added to the list. I may use less grenadine next time to let the vodka cut through some more. We also used Cranberry Black Cherry juice instead which was like we mixed two of the most popular cheesecakes toppings and mixing them together!!! Will keep this one in the pocket of tricks! Thanks!",
