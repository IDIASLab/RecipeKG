I use Owens sausage sometimes I use hot and sometimes I use maple flavor sausage. Sounds funny but it really adds a great flavor. I brown up the sausage like the ground beef. Takes a little effort but worth it. Also I suggest using salf free chips or reduced salt because I think regular chips and the dip make it way too salty.",

Though, because of the cheese, and the chips, this can sometimes it can be a little salty.  Overall, depending if you like mushroom soup, you could probable try just about any kind of soup for this recipe... very tasty,",
