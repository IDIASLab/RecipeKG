I still combined the cream cheese and sour cream spread it on bagel and put in a toaster oven. Once the bagels were toasted I layered the rest of the recipe on top of the mixture. It kinda came-out like a lox bagel with a twist. We serve it for brunch and everyone was blown away with it. They kept guessing what's in it that made the difference - they couldn't tell.
