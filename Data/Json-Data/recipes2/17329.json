That will help keep them juicy & add flavor. I was unsure as to whther the recipe meant to use the greenery of the lavender or teh lavender buds. Never used the greenery before but assumed that it would be \"lavender buds\" if that was what was intended, so I used the greenery. I was also unsure of using so much, since lavender can have such an overpowering flavor, but I braved it. I was soo glad....it had lots of flavor w/out the unpleasant \"perfumey\" taste that the buds can have. I decreased the oil by half & next time, I will only give them a rub of oil & then just rub on the herbs, to avoid flare-ups on the grill. I drizzled a bit of honey on the plate to dress it up some & it added the perfect flavor. We both got more \"drizzle\" when we ran out. ;o) Loved the recipe & I will definitely repeat but I'll make my suggested changes next time.",

I added a bit of oil to both sides and then rubbed in the herbs and let it sit for about 20 mins before cooking. They got a good taste to them but as others have stated they are lacking in some flavor. Family agreed that they were okay but thought other pork recipes were better. I may though try this one again and add some salt and pepper to spice it up. I suggest that others do so too if they are the type to need a bit more umph to their meat.",
