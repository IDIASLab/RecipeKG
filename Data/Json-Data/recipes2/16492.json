I used 1/2 2% milk and 1/2 cream, but almost a 1/3 cup of grated asiago, and it was perfect and creamy.  Also, skipped the butter and just threw the garlic and onion in at the beginning of rendering the bacon.  I left out the chicken, as that was my main dish, but cut the bacon into larger chunks and it was great!  Also doubled the garlic amount, and added salt, pepper, cayenne, and red pepper flakes to liven it up a bit.  At the end of sauteing the veggies i threw in about 8 oz sliced fresh mushrooms, and it was phenomonal!!  Tossed the cooked pasta with fresh chopped parsley, olive oil, pepper, and a little parmasan and served with Mushroom and Swiss Chicken (see review)...I thought my boy was gonna fall to his knees and start to sob from sheer appreciation!",

Definitely use the 1 cup of asiago cheese for the real flavor of the cheese. I also substituted 2% milk for one of the two first cups of cream. I could have done without the sundried tomatoes. I realized too late that they should have gone in first thing so they could soften up and provide the flavor they were supposed to. I also used about 1/4 cup of chives in place of the green onion for color and for a less pungent onion flavor, the red onion provides plenty of that. A fabulous recipe, well worth the effort!

Changes: Did not use bacon Used half milk half cream Used olive oil for veggies added a bit of butter for taste Doubled garlic Used 3/4 c asiago Added 1/4 cup chardonnay with initial cream and tomatoes Soaked sun-dried tomatoes ahead of time and simmered sauce after tomatoes went in on really low heat for about 15 minutes. Had to add a bit more milk. I think simmering the sauce with the soaked tomatoes really helped their flavor dispense.",

In reference to previous reviews that complained of the tomatoes being too dry I would recommend either buying the sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil or re-hydrating the dry kind by immersing them in a little olive oil and water and microwaving for 30-40 seconds. Drain them and add them at the same time as the asiago and bouillon. I only made a few slight modifications. The heavy cream is really not necessary I used 2% for the first part and 10% for the second and the sauce came out plenty rich! Also if you're a garlic fan double what the recipe recommends. I used about 1/3 of a cup of Asiago as someone had recommended but found it a bit too salty. I will use a little less next time or omit the bacon. Great dish!",

I'll be making this for company soon. I added basil freshly ground pepper & extra cheese to the sauce. I used much less than 1 cup of sun-dried tomatoes. I wasn't sure if I liked them or not so didn't want a bunch. I probably used 1/3 cup & it was perfect. I also omitted the red onion since I don't like cooked red onions and used 8 ozs of fresh mushrooms sliced instead. YUM! The last cup of heavy cream I switched to 1 cup 1% milk. I never need to eat out again. This is better than anything at Olive Garden--seriously! Everyone at my house loved this!",

I took the advice of increasing the cheese (I used about 3/4 cup) and I decreased the onion (boyfriend is not too fond of them I used 1/2 cup each of green and red and still was a bit much). I would half the recipe if not making it for a group of people next time. Since there is only two of us we had lots of leftovers which wouldn't usually be a problem since we try to take leftovers for lunch the next day. When reheating the sauce breaks and becomes very greasy! Otherwise it was great and will make again.",

Other than that, I didn't have a red onion on hand so I used shallots and sauted that in 2 tblsp of olive oil rather than butter. I also threw in about 1/2 c. of pine nuts w/ the garlic and shallots, omitted green onions and used 1/4 c. chopped fresh basil. I used Penne pasta and toppped w/ parsley and feta cheese.
