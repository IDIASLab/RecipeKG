I made the blintzes the night before (put them in a greased baking dish, covered with plastic wrap, in the fridge overnight) then finished them the next morning. I also had to modify the filling to use what I had on hand: I used 2 cups cottage cheese instead of ricotta and cottage cheese. I mixed the filling in the food processor. I served them topped with raspberry sauce and fresh blackberries. Next time, I\u2019m doubling the crepe recipe\u2014I had extra filling, and you can always find ways to eat extra crepes! Oh: I got 12 crepes from the single batch of batter, but tore the first one until I got my pan temp right. I ate that one plain. Delicious!",

I use apx 1 small ice cream scoop each and fold like a lumpia (or burrito )\n\n\nThese are absolutely FANTASTIC! My family is brutally honest when it comes to new recipes. Have made this 4 times in last 2 weeks. Each time Friends and Family fight over who gets the last one. \n\nI always try a recipe exactly as written the first time, this gives me a good idea of what I need to change to suit our families tastes. This recipe has yet to have any alterations. It is perfect as written and SO easy! I use my food processor for the batter and hand mix the filling (softened cream cheese makes for easy blending). You can make all components the night before for easy assembly in the AM..  I use Chef Johns Strawberry sauce recipe and top with fresh blackberries and rasberries. \n\nThis will be made on a regular basis. I highly recommend trying it, you will be thrilled you did.\n\nTips: use just under a quarter cup of batter. Spray pan with pam every 2 - 3  \"cakes\" to prevent sticking. \n- as soon as you poor in batter, swirl pan to evenly distribute batter. \nAs soon as top no longer looks wet ( just dry enough to flip, maybe 30 sec or so) flip over.  10 sec and they are done. Really that quick. \n\nTo fill I use 1 small ice cream scoop and spread in a line slightly (2 in long) roll like a borrito folding sides in.",

I used marscapone cheese in place of cream cheese, as Chef John uses in his Food Wishes video. But I think next time I'll use cream cheese. The filling was just a little bland, and I think the cream cheese would have added a nice tangyness. I topped these with Chef John's fresh strawberry sauce. A winner for the whole family!",
