I do make the patties ahead of time and put back in the refrigerator until time to cook. That seems to help them stay together a little better. Awesome!! Loved these burgers! I made the recipe as is only cooked them in a skillet on the stove. They were juicy and very flavorful. Will definitely make again.",

That's probably why so many people had trouble with these forming and falling apart on the grill. These are similar to Ranch burgers from this site.  I used 1 oz. of ranch mix for a little over a pound of ground turkey, 1 tsp. of dried minced onion, 1 clove of minced garlic, 1/2 tsp. of onion powder, and 1/4 c. of bread crumbs.  I mixed these and then let them set in the fridge for an hour.  This helps them to set and for the flavors to come through.  No problems on the grill and they had a very nice ranch flavor.  ",
