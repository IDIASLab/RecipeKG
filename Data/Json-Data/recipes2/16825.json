I usually won't eat fish but we found a pre-marninated salmon at a store and fell in love and then of course the store stopped carrying it! This recipe produces almost the exact same flavor! Instead of grilling it though I put it under the broiler to let it brown. Then if it still needs some time to reach ideal temp I crank the oven to 450 to let it finish off. Great recipe! Thanks!",
