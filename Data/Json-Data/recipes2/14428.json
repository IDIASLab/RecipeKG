I made it with non-wheat flour (rice and potato flour a commercial brand) which requires you use less liquid in recipes but still ended up putting in an extra cup or so of the non-wheat flour until I got a mixture that would roll into balls. Hey it turned out fine in the end. These are not sweet cookies and if you use non-sugar jam (jam sweetened on fruit concentrate) rather than ordinary sugar jam you will - with a bit of experimenting with the flour- end up with okay sugar-free biscuits. My diabetic uncle sure loves them! Me too.",
