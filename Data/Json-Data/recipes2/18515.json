The enoki mushrooms and leek may as well not have been there and there was only a hint of saltiness from the bacon. The chili paste was way too hot too (but that may well have just been the brand I used). If I were to make this again I would use a milder-tasting fish like tilapia use chestnut mushrooms and onion. This is worth playing around with imo.",

I didn't have the mushrooms or chili sauce on hand. I partially pre- fried the bacon because it was thick cut applewood bacon and I didn't want to overcook the fish trying to get the bacon done. Used two slices bacon for each roll because they were shorter than regular bacon. Plenty of saltiness and flavor maybe the difference is the bacon used. All the family liked it and I thought it was much better than the mayo/sour cream/parmesan cheese cod that my husband loves ( and I am tired of eating). Finally a cod recipe that's easy and yummy!",
