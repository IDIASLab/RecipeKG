I used Classico brand four cheese pasta sauce which I love when I can't make my own. However I could not find cottage cheese with chives ANYWHERE! I looked looked looked... So I had some ricotta in the refrigerator and just went ahead and used that. I also sprinkled some parmesan on top. I had some spinach occupying space in my refrigerator so I threw that in there too. Yes I changed it up a bit but like the author said this recipe \"can be a start for so many variations\". That's definitely true. Make it your own. It is a great base recipe and I loved the change of pace when it comes to texture on an italian dish. I pour some sauce in the middle of a serving plate and placed the polenta on top made it look pretty and served it with a side dish of steamed broccoli. Yum Yum!",

For the sauce I substituted Johnsonville mild Italian sausage for the ground beef giving it a couple of quick pulses in my food processor after browning to give it a finer more beef-like texture. Delicious! My whole family liked it. Thanks for the recipe Angie!",
