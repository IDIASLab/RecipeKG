After cheese mixture is spread on the bread I freeze them on a cookie sheet and when frozen transfer them to a plastic container or bag. To bake- just place on sheet and pop into the oven.

I also improvised with half of the appetizers by adding one slice of a grape tomato (like a tiny plum tomato) to the top of the bread before adding the mixture. It turned out very tasty as the tomato stayed firm under the filling. I'm also going to try using this as a filling for my homemade dough. Thanks!",
