Also I drained the potatoes to get all the water out. It gave it great texture. 2 - I didn't use canned corn. I used corn that I had frozen from last summer. 3 - Salt & Pepper. I added at least a Tablespoon of ground black pepper. 4 - Frank's RedHot! Perfectly blended with these ingredients & gave it a nice kick. Thank you for a good base recipe that is easy to maniuplate to still get a great chowder!",
