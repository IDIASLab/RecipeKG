If you're an entertainer, these cupcakes are great for special occasions, and can be adorned with candy and other treats to match a holiday. I used these cupcakes for Christmas and they were delicious!!! Try them with a warm cup of milk or some coffee. Anything you can make with gingerbread is better with gingerbread cupcakes.",

More egg dries.); increased cinnamon to 1 1/2t; added 1/8t cloves & 1/2t vanilla; as listed 1 1/2t ginger & 1/4t nutmeg. Oh used a yellow mix. Oh:D subbed plain yogurt for the buttermilk. Too many changes?! Sorry. I was going for the 24 regular sized but they would've been pretty low so made 18. The batter's pretty syrupy understandably with molasses & 4 eggs so I see the suggestion of plastic bagging it. 'Didn't do it. Just know it's going to be challenging. The directions! What?! Just till combined? What?! Nah. I added the spices to the dry mix. In a measuring cup measured the oil added the molasses to the 3/4 level mixed in the half cup yogurt. Added to bowl. Beat the eggs a little in that measuring cup & added with the vanilla. One minute to moisten a couple to blend. Anxious to try. Results: I overbaked since the middle was low. 'Just okay. 'Not much ginger bite. 'Feel like I wasted the molasses on this one.:( Surprisingly not too sweet with the sugar in the mix & the molasses.",
