I was going to add a little lemon juice, as suggested by other reviewers, but once I tasted the original sauce as written, I was already hooked.  This made a boatload of sauce and I spooned the extra over baked potatoes, then sprinkled with bacon bits.  We liked it on the potatoes even more than on the salmon.... seriously, this stuff would make treebark taste fantastic! Awesome recipe!",
