I have several Aunts and Uncles who are diabetic and was looking for a new recipe that they could enjoy at a family dinner.  This caught my eye because my oldest Aunt had been talking about the great biscuit puddings that my grand mother used to make when they were all growing up.  While they all said that this was not quite like what Mom used to make they all enjoyed it very much and three of them had to have copies to make later at home.  This was my first experience cooking with Splenda but it was simply fantastic and I will be using it again, probably many times.   I will make this pudding again too.",
