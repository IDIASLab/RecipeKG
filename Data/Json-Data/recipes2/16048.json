I served it the peppers on a bed of spaghetti squash. Changes I recommend...add italian sausage add some table white wine (dry is best) when cooking the onions and garlic add a tablespoon of oregano and once the peppers are done cover them with shaved parmesan (from a block of cheese not that pregrated stuff). Sprinkle chopped parsley as a garnish over the top of the peppers. Oh and one last thing...slice the peppers lengthwise and make pepper boats. You can fit a lot into the pepper and it's more stable when sitting on a plate. Bon Appetit!",

I came across this recipe because we all miss my MIL's stuffed peppers now that she's gone and this was the closest to it I could find. I added some pepperoni and soppresata (dry sausage) which my mother in law taught me to \"boil in a little water to get out some of the fat\" and then chop into a super small dice. That way there's some in every bite. I made it once without the \"boil\" and found that the pepperoni was like little hard nuggests - we prefer that it be boiled a little first - its softer in the finished pepper We get the \"salt\" flavor from this rather than the anchovies. Also she always added some freshly grated Parmesan or Romano cheese to the mixture and regular black olives chopped up and ALWAYS used the day old Italian bread rather than boxed bread crumbs.",
