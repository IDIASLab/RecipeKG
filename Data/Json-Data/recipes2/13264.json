Because I had to use what I had at home I didn't have Johnsonville chicken so I used regular boneless chicken breast I cut up (I seasoned the chicken very well in a pan with oil). No bell peppers so I used an half onion to replace that. Like the other poster I had to add a bit more chicken broth but I'll be making this again. My kids loved it and asked for seconds!!",

Next time I think I'll saut\u00e9 the peppers garlic and lemon zest by themselves before adding the peas a little later so the garlic and lemon are incorporated throughout the whole dish and the peas aren't quite so soft. I also used more than 1 tsp of lemon zest probably closer to 1.5 or 2 tsp; I'd go even heavier on the lemon zest. You need a lot of lemon to balance out that much garlic. I think I also ended up with more than 2 cups of pasta and that worked out really well. There was plenty of cream cheese and everything to coat it all. Overall an excellent dish and very easy to prepare!",
