I just dumped a 1/4 cup of rice mixture into the cutter and let him press the rice mixture with his little fingers. I used gluten free bread crumbs. I left out the soy due to not having access to the ready rice mentioned, I used Uncle Ben's Mediterranean Express Rice. They baked in 10 minutes perfectly. At first, while you are mixing them, they seem like they won't stick together - they do, be patient. Mix with your hands and press it into the cookie cutter. Both adults and kids will enjoy these. Thank you Mis7up for your fun recipe.",

They baked up just fine and held together beautifully. As prepared we thought on their own they were a little bland but when dipped in a bit more soy or ponzu they were fine. Maybe just a touch of salt or perhaps some chopped green onion to give them pizzazz. My husband also used them as a base (see picture) for holding other parts of his meal. All around- tasted like fried rice and something we'll make again!",
