First I added a tablespoon of crushed garlic to the butter and diced onions. I then added a pint of thickend cream and 1/4 cup of dry sherry to the pan along with the feta cheese. I simmered that until it was reduced then added a pound of shrimp and some minced chives. This made it substantially a different recipe but one I could serve to company. The basic recipe was a good start just needed some major tweaking. My changes served over the pasta made 4 very generous servings for my company. Thanks for the basics though....great springboard!",

I doubled the amount of shrimp and feta (since I like a significant amount of protein) and cut the pasta in half to make 4 servings. Since I will be the only one eating it I added about 2 tablespoons of butter to the pasta to keep it from becoming a nasty congealed lump before my next meal. The ease of preparation is an added bonus. I am grateful for this recipe and will definitely be making it often.",

It is a very easy recipe to make when in a rush ( I used 42g of feta as well as 113g of prawns). The liquid from the prawns helps to make the sauce which is great as an alternative to red sauce. Even my 3 year old loved it. This was just enough for 1 person as I wasn't feeding many. Next time I will add from chopped garlic and maybe a bit of fresh parsley.",
