Wanted to comment for the person who said when they melted their chips that they were dry and crumbly.... they were most likely cooked too long in the microwave/got too hot. Just melt for a few seconds maybe 15 to 30 seconds at a time then stir then put back into microwave and repeat steps again just until melted and then stop or they will come \"out of solution\" so to speak and begin to transform into a hard crumbly mess.:-)",
