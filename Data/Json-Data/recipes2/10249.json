I tried this recipe because I like breakfast recipes that may be made in advance and then leftovers work for breakfasts on busy mornings. Well I'm glad I tried it because I have eaten it 2 days in a row and I will eat it again tomorrow! This has lots of tasty veggies and I really think for the number of eggs I could easily double the veggies for even more flavor next time. This was lovely on a bed of fresh spinach with some cantaloupe on the side. No need for additional meat as there is plenty in the dish. Pantry finds are always fun and now I know what folks are talking about when they talk about hash! Thanks for the idea!",
