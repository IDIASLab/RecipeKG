I also layered the rice sausage/veggie/sauce mixture and cheese then left in in the pan with the lid on for a bit (10-15 minutes or so?) to heat through and fully melt the cheese. It's been a while since everyone obviously loved dinner around here but they all raved about this dish-- one of my sons said: \"It was great just needed a little more broccoli and a little more sausage and a little more rice... wait never mind. We just should have doubled the recipe for more everything.\"",
