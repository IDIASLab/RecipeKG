Since I was serving rice on the side I doubled the sauce (except the flour used only 1/3 cup) and added just a slight pinch of salt. The wonderful sauce and the sour cream on the salmon surface take away any fishy or strong flavor. Made this for the first time today and served it to friends. You received RAVE reviews. It's such simple elegance. Served with rice fresh asparagus and rolls and additional Chardonnay to drink it was a totally delicious dinner. Thank you very much for sharing this wonderful recipe!
