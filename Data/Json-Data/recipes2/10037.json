This is a great pick me up in the afternoon - much cheaper than Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts for that matter! I made this exactly as the recipe stated the first time. I liked it so much the next time I added a little ice and put it in a blender to thicken it then topped it with whipped cream and chocolate syrup (I know really bad). I think if I make it again I'll lighten it up a bit and sub in fat free half and half (forget the whipped cream and chocolate syrup lol). Great recipe!",

I used just one packet of sweetener and vanilla almond milk. I am hooked! Thanks so much for sharing!! I will have this drink again and again and again.....:)",
