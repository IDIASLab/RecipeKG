I did change it by using only one bell pepper and one onion, which was more than plenty, I can't imagine using four bell peppers  and two onions, it would have been way too much!  I also used only 8 oz of the 16 oz jar of salsa, which seemed perfect to us.  I think it would have been even better with fresh salsa.  My husband loved it, we will be making it again!",

I didn't have everything on hand (no yellow rice or red bell pepper) but it tasted great with white rice and the flavored sausage I had on hand. In fact my two picky kids even liked it. My husband loved it. So looks like we'll be making again. Since the sausage I used was already flavored I nixed the Italian seasoning; I thought it would have been overkill with the sausage and salsa spices. I'll try to find yellow rice for next time though I may end up just using white rice again but cooking it with chicken broth to give it flavor.",
