Both candy canes as well as other various candies could be incorporated (ie M&Ms, sprinkles).  It also works well using melted white chocolate chips.   Dont hesitate to use microwaved popped popcorn as long as it does not have a lot of butter or salt - we make this recipe in batches of 2 - 3 bags at a time.  Here's a tip to mix this MESS FREE: generously Pam spray the inside of a large paper grocery bag.  Then fill with popped popcorn and pour the warm melted coating right on top (along with any other candies of choice).  Close top of bag and shake vigorously.  Pour the coated popcorn out onto a cookie sheet.  Once cooled, break apart and portion out into cellophane or plastic baggies.  Play around with colors by tinting melted white chocolate coating with food coloring then drizzling onto popcorn during the 'cooling' step mentioned above.",

Which seemed to be an easier way to mix. I did use my hand to mix after shaking the bag. It was a big hit!!",

Crushing the candy canes real fine so that there aren't many chunks and giving it a nice subtle peppermint flavor it how I prefer it.  With the popcorn and m&m's, it would also be good adding in pretzels and peanuts to make a sweet n salty mix.  So good, thanks for this great recipe idea!",
