I had my honeydew chilled in the fridge before I cut it up so this cut some of the chilling time down. Also I tried without the oatmeal cookie and while it was very good the cookie added a little something extra. Plan to try it with an iced oatmeal cookie in a few minutes to see how that goes. Everyone loved this and I will be making many more times. Also I took one cookie and shredded it instead of crumbling and it absorbed the moisture too much. Make them big crumbles.",

I added about 1/2 cup of plain whole milk yogurt and approx 1/4 cup sugar to the honeydew in the blender. Then I strained the puree through a mesh colander to thin out the slightly grainy texture of the soup. Finally I used blackberries instead of blueberries (only because blueberries weren't in season) and left off the cookie (because I didn't have one and because I think the thinner soup wouldn't support a cookie crumble).
