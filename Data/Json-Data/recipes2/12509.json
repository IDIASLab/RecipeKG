Substitutions for spices and vegetables are fine -- add the tastes that your family likes most. You can make this on the stovetop in a skillet with a lid, as well. Bring all ingredients to a boil and stir well; cover and simmer for 25 minutes or until rice is soft. If you add some of the optional ingredients, this can be an excellent main dish. Try adding chopped green chile peppers. Tastes great with the Enchilada II recipe.",
