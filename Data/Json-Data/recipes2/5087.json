After reading the reviews I peeled the eggplant and salted and added olive oil and balsamic vinegar to both sides.

Put in oven for 15 minutes at 350. Topped with basil. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!",

Broiled for five minutes then added the cheese and tomatoes and baked all together till the eggplant was soft which took a little longer than 10 minutes for me. When I brought them out of the oven I drizzled with more vinegar and sprinkled the basil on. The skin of the eggplant was a little tough but I enjoyed the rest. They were pretty and very colorful on the plate. I think I would prefer this with goat cheese crumbles and may try that in the future. Thanks for a new idea!",
