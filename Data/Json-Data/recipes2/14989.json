I like to use either homemade dry ranch dip or homemade dry vegetable dip in place of the dill dip (making it homemade adds more flavor and cuts out the extra salt or even MSG which is in some pre-packaged dip mixes) and I use frozen spinach that I've thawed and squeezed out all the moisture out of. If you have it this is also good with some chopped marinated artichoke hearts folded in too. Never fails to disappear. NOTE: Using reduced fat sour cream cream cheese and mayonnaise really does NOT affect the taste at all. Feel free to substitute without worries.",
