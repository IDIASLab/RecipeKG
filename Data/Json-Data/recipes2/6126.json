It was a little garlicky but I think it may have also been the size of the cloves I used. I am not sure so if I make again I will cut back on the garlic a bit. I left out the sun-dried tomatoes because they were optional and I do not care for them anyway. I might try them that way for a party though for some added color. My dip melted all together in the oven but didn't get a light golden brown like the picture even keeping it in the oven a tad longer. But I don't think that affected the flavor. Next time If I decide to make again I might also try lite mayonnaise as the cheese is already rich enough. Either way the whole pan got eaten!",
