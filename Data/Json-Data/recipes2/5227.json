Using a Kitchen Aid (Classic) it took 6 minutes on high to get butter. I draped a dish towel around the head to catch any splatter. Squeezing out the excess buttermilk is not as difficult as I had expected. I put the butter ball in an ice bowl a couple of times but not for 20 minutes it didn't need it. Once transferred into a container with a rubber spatula I was able to squeeze out a few more drops of buttermilk. A 500ml bottle of heavy cream gave me about one cup of butter. I used the buttermilk (although not cultured it's still tasty) in my pancake batter then topped them with the fresh butter. A little stack of heaven on a plate! For the leftover butter I mixed in some fresh herbs/spices and froze it in silicone ice trays for later use. Thank you for this recipe.",

I made this and homemade bread with my 5 year old granddaughter and it was a fun delicious and interesting learning experience. She learned how cows give us milk and cream which can be made into whipped cream ice cream butter and cheese. We took half the butter and added honey and cinnamon which was also delicious. I will be making this again and again. Thanks!",
