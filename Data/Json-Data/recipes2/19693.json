I used a variety of vegetables to use what I had in the fridge - bell peppers yellow squash bok choy green beans broccoli mushrooms and onions. Skipped the optional serrano peppers ginger and cilantro. I used the oyster sauce but not the fish sauce only because I didn't have it to use. The toasted sesame seeds and sliced green onions were a nice finish. Wok not necessary - a skillet will do! This vegetable dish is delicious of course - but I do kind of question all the ingredients listed as optional.",
