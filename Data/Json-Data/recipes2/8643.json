I added a melted stick of butter because... well butter. I also took another reviewer's advice to toss the apples in cinnamon and sugar. I cut the ginger in half because ginger scares me. Mine took a total of 60 minutes to cook through and I had to cover it with foil half way through to keep it from over-browning. I made half with pecans and half without for the kids. It was not overly sweet and people could add syrup to their liking. Definitely a keeper! Easily feeds at least 6-8 people!",
