Anyhow they smelled amazing and looked absolutely gorgeous. I dipped in syrup. But the taste is very very...yeasty at the risk of sounding \"duh\". As in it's actually kind of sour. I had to use a lot of syrup for dipping. Very odd. I would love to find out/figure out a good fix for these like adding more sugar.",
