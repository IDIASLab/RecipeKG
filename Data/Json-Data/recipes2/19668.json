I liked the overall flavor and the tofu came out really good, but I did alter the recipe and would alter again if  I give this another try. First of all I omitted ingredients I did not want: carrots, peas, bamboo shoots and  bell peppers. If I make it again I will add more coconut milk because this recipe came out too dry. I'd also peel the eggplants and leave the kefir leaves whole. I ended up picking eggplant skins, lemon grass, kefir leaves and galangal out as I ate as they were tough/inedible. Overall, the flavor was good, but not at all spicy, so I might be tempted to add Thai chili pepper, fish sauce in stead of soy sauce and some Thai basil.",
