If I had to say that there's anything wrong with it, it's that it's so good, I literally want to put it on everything. In addition to traditional chicken satay, I thin it with a little oil for salad dressing, use it as a dip for chicken nuggets, vegetables, crackers, bread, fingers, the palm of my hand, etc.... Quick lunch? Pour this bad boy sauce into a bowl of cooked spaghetti noodles. Oh yeah, I've done it. And I'll do it again, too.",
