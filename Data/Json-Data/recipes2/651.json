So all I have to do is pull it out of the freezer, cook it in the microwave, cool it and then squeeze it out.  Saves so much time and this is a nice sturdy crust that can hold lots of toppings and doesn't even taste like cauliflower, can you believe that?  The key is to squeeze it dry, really squeeze it out good otherwise it is soft when baked.",

With about 10 minutes left in the oven, I flipped it and browned the other side. Topped it with sauce and cheese and threw it back in until the cheese was bubbling and brown. My sauce was very mild, so to add more \"pizza\" flavour, I will add some oregano and garlic to the mix next time, but all in all, this is a phenomenal way to cure a pizza craving while on a  low carb diet! Great recipe!",

This will be a go to crust forever!\nWarning:  if you are looking for a quick crust, this is not it. It takes time to do this so plan on starting 2 hours before you want to eat. You have to wait for it to cool and cooking time is an hour.",

Makes it firmer. Then let it cool for 10 minutes before you add your toppings, cook at 450 for 10 minutes and then on broil till the cheese is how you like it. Lovely recipe. Thank you chef. : )",

I don't own a food processor, so I cooked my cauliflower florets first, drained then mashed with a potato masher. Squeezed out the excess water, then mixed the spices and egg in.
