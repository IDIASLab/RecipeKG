However I made them the same way (Folded in half) and in a pan like making grilled cheese sandwiches. They were much better like that. I tried this way and found that the skin on the beef was more tough after being in the oven for 20 minutes. The cheese was over done this way and honestly the bread doesn't brown as well (at least in my oven) and just got a bit of color and more dry. I'd recommend making these in a pan instead of in the oven. Taste is better and it's done quicker.",

I ended up using 3 toothpicks to secure it because just using one tore the bread. The beef franks are a little too big for my kids so I used regular hot dogs. As much as I love cooking I don't do it until after my little ones are in bed so I'm really happy about this because I can throw it together and let it bake while I play with them. Thank you for posting this recipe it's given me so much more than just the Weiner Winks! One more thing instead of getting butter on my fingers while I roll it I just wrap the hot dog first and then spray the no calorie butter spray on the outside. Still bakes up nice and toasty!",
