The only change I made was to use a little extra 5-Spice Powder and these were so amazingly fantastic that my husband immediately asked when we would be having them again. I'm not normally a fan of turkey burgers and even I was wolfing mine down! I cooked these on my George Foreman grill for 6 minutes which was perfect and served them on home-made onion buns with goat's milk gouda. My only complaint was that I couldn't really taste the pineapple (probably due to using canned instead of fresh). Next time I will likely omit it and replace is with a dollop of a tangy barbeque sauce we like. Really fantastic recipe!!! Okay it's now \"next time!\" This time I added a little more 5-spice powder replaced the gouda with smoked mozzarella (it's what I had) and made sure to use fresh pineapple instead of canned and oh WOW what a difference! The hubby and I agreed immediately that the fresh pineapple takes this to a whole another level.",
