It was an excellent addition to my salad. The longer it sits, the better it gets. VERY good and insanely simple. I'll use this \"dressing\" recipe again. NOTE: I cannot stress enough how important it is to use a quality balsamic. Mine pours out almost like molasses and the flavor is incredible. Using a cheaper balsamic will give you inferior results.

Although the dip was flavorful, we felt there was too much garlic and oregano added which tasted very spicey.  Maybe we are just used to the olive oil dip at the restaurants that they pour from a bottle and the spices are marinating in the bottle, not ending up on the bread.  I will try again making adjustments to the oregano and garlic.",
