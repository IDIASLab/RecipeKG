I used chicken broth instead of the heavy cream...added chives....used \"real\" shredded cheese instead of the velveeta.    Ham or chorizo are welcome additions too.   I threw everything in the crockpot and let it cook on low for 5 hours....very comforting on a chilly day.   Very versatile.   Thank you!    If the soup is too thin for your liking,  try adding in some instant mashed potato flakes to thicken it up.",

When my best friend was going through chemo treatments, I would make and freeze multiple bags of this soup so she always had it on hand.  It was the one food that she could consistently keep down after her treatments.  Also, with all the calories and carbs, it helped keep weight on her as she fought her illness. I'm happy to say that she is now a BC Survivor and she swears this soup is one of the reasons. This is a very hearty and delicious soup and super easy to make. It a great soup on a cold winter night and it absolutely hits the spot. It's definitely not a low fat meal but when you are craving a high carb, hearty, stick to your ribs soup, this is it!!",
