I used a package of Uncle Bens Wild Rice.  Make sure you cook it with the seasoning packet.  I reduced the amount of sour cream to 1/2 cup, the cheese to 1 cup and didn't drain the green chiles.  I didn't bother layering, just mixed it all up in a bowl and poured into my pan.  Yummy.  I think you could really soup this up by adding sliced olives, mushrooms, sauteed onions, etc.  You could even add some diced chicken and make it a meal.  Very versatile.",

I reduced the amount of sour cream and cheddar cheese. Even though I doubled the recipe I only used 1 cup of light sour cream and 2 cups of cheddar cheese. I used 2 cans of green chilies and used the juice. I didn't drain them as the recipe suggested. This was a very easy recipe. I made the rice earlier in the day and then just before the dinner party I layered all of the ingredients and baked the dish. It turned out great.",

Monterey Jack and 8 oz. cheddar and I was short about 2 tablespoons sour cream so I threw in some ranch dip (that I had made with sour cream) to make up the difference. Will definitely make again. I may throw in some shredded cooked chicken or a layer of prepared taco meat. Love it! Additional note: I browned 8 oz. ground beef and used 1/2 a packet of taco seasoning mix to make taco meat and added 1/2 on top of the rice and then the other half on top of the 2nd layer of rice. Awesome - my family loved it!",
