I often find these cake mixes come out dry and grainy, but in the case of this recipe, I think the pudding moistened and smoothed out the  batter nicely. \r\n\r\nI used the idea of some of the people who commented here, filling each cup 1/3 full with batter, scooping in a spoonful of preserves, and covering the preserves with more batter, filling the cup to about 2/3 full.\r\n\r\nI didn't have paper or foil baking cups that day, so I sprayed the cups of the pan liberally with cooking spray and then brushed the insides with vegetable oil. When the cupcakes were done, I flipped the pan and the cupcakes fell right out. This caused the preserves to break through the top of a few cupcakes, so next time I'll hold a baking sheet over the cupcake pan before flipping it, so the cupcakes don't have as far to fall.",
