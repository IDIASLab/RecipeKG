I used green onions and a sweet white onion because that was what was on hand. I also used agave instead of honey. Next time I'll add mango & avocado - its a very versatile dish. I had some guests over for mexican dinner night. This dish made a great appetizer with tortilla chips in front of some fresh fish tacos. It would have been good with the tacos but didn't last long enough! The cumin and curry really add alot so don't forget them!!!",
