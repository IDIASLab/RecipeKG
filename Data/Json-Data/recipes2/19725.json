The sweet crabmeat in a piquant tomato broth makes an elegant dinner party starter, or can be served with a few simple quesadillas for an easy dinner at home. Each coastal chef has a distinct interpretation of this dish, but the secret ingredient they all agree on is pan-roasted vegetables. Some time in a hot skillet makes all the difference- adding a deeper vegetable flavor to your chilapachole.",

At first it seemed a bit too watery and thought I needed some heavy cream or some sort of thickener. it thickened up a bit as soon as I transferred it back to the pan. I goofed again and chopped up the chilies in the beginning so I had to just roll with it. The soup was spicy but my friends and I enjoyed the spice level. The lime really shined and definitely needed to top this soup off.",
