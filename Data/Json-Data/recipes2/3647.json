        "description": "Easy chicken dish that takes no time. My kids help me with it every time. It's cheesy chicken nachos. I add some red pepper flakes and jalapeno juice to the mixture just to bring it up a notch. Our family also likes to put it in a flour tortilla. I have also used it the next day (if there is any left), rolled it in a flour tortilla, and fried it. If you would like to make it healthier, you can. I have changed the sour cream to light and/or low-fat. I have also changed the soup to reduced-fat. The only thing I haven't been able to change is the cheese.",
