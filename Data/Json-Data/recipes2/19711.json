And not enough sauce.\" I didn't deviate from the ingredient list or instructions other than using a small can of organic Costco mushrooms rather than the fresh that I didn't (but wish I had) have on-hand. That little swap saved me a bit of time but wow the prep chopping and hands-on time for this recipe was much more than the 20 min. listed. My husband and I agreed that it was a very peculiar \"casserole\" that needed... not sure; time in the oven? Mixed w/ rice or quinoa? But no question about it it needed more sauce. (Very dry!) It was an unusual combination of veggies and the arugula that we love seemed like a garnish. Other than the kick from the two types of peppers there wasn't a whole lot of taste so coupled w/ the effort I'd have to change way too much in order to make this again.",
