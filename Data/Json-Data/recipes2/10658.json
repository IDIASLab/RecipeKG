If you think margarita mix or frozen limeade + tequila is yummy, or you like \"blended\" margaritas, this might be more than you bargained for. If you like margaritas the way God intended them (on the rocks, with salt, made from scratch) you can't do better than this. Using fresh limes means you might taste some differences from batch to batch. Too sour? Add a dash more triple sec. If you don't have any Rose's Lime Juice you can just skip the \"sweetened lime juice\" part. I often make them with just 5 parts tequila, 4 parts triple sec, and 3 parts FRESH lime juice and they are fine. Just keep in mind, this is a serious cocktail for people with grownup palates.",
