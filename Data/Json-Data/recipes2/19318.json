I loved it so much I had to come home and figure out how to make it.  This was by far the best recipe I found.  To make it more like The Corner Bakery version I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain and rather than add a cup of raisins I used a mixture of currants, raisins, and dried cranberries.  I also added half of a Granny Smith apple per bowl for a tart flavor like they do.  The only thing missing was one of their awesome raisin crisps covered with raw sugar!  Just a tip, I leave a big bowl of oats, honey, milk, and yogurt in the fridge then by the bowl add the rest.  This keeps the sliced and quartered bananas and apples fresh and yummy and the oats nice and soggy!",

My son loves it too, and that means a lot since he can be quite picky. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I add different things to mine, so it's not exactly this recipe that I use. My favorite fruit to add is dried blueberries or sometimes I add frozen mixed berries (which of course are completely thawed by morning), but I'll use any fruit that is handy.  The best thing is that this does not leave you feeling empty later in the morning, so you don't overeat at lunchtime.  Delicious, healthy and inexpensive! ",

Sometimes I add an apple or berries, whatever I have on hand. I also like to add a couple Tbsp of flax seeds and a little cinnamon.  ",
