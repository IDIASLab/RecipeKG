Made exactly as written and would not change a thing...my only criticism is that this did not make enough for 6 sandwiches I only got 4 but I guess if I would've used less filling per sandwich I could've streched it but I wanted nice full sandwiches. I would def double this next time for my family as we all really really LOVED this sandwich. The kids were calling them 'sloppy kielbasa sandwiches' and I think that was perfectly fitting lol! I served them with curly fries which made for a perfect fun and delicious dinner. This is a definite keeper YUM YUM YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing.:)",
