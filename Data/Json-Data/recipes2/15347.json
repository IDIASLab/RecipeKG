Their advice: simmer about 5 minutes in saucepan drain and chop. Also I needed much more than 1/2 cup drippings. I used chicken broth (about a cup or more). Most people liked this at our pitch-in. I guess you need to like the flavor of oysters. I would also advise greasing the baking dish. Enjoy!",

This dressing is really mild and as written needed more oysters. In all fairness to Lisa she notes that the oyster volume should be adjusted to taste which I will do next time. I will research spices to add next time I use this recipe. The large baking dish required in the instructions was too large. The dressing was spread too thin and could have easily been burned. I will use a smaller baking dish next time.",
