I never measure just start with drizzling olive oil on cookie sheet add as much fresh spinach as possible marinated artichoke hearts some garlic salt sprinkle with bacon bits drizzle artichoke marinade from the jar over salad (be generous) and add feta cheese over top of salad. If you have a red onion slice it thin and add it. Makes a complete meal for two. Thanks so much for the recipe....",

Then it occurred to me that probably 3 Tbsp would be plenty for this much spinach if I tossed the marinade with the spinach first before putting it on the baking sheet. Worked like a charm. I also coursely chopped the artichoke hearts and used a bit of parmesan in place of the feta. (We had feta several times this week in other dishes and wanted variety.) Cooked for 8 minutes which was plenty. Big hit with everyone. Thanks.",

I contemplated using canned artichokes bc they're cheaper but I think the flavor would've really been compromised. Also the salad looked beautiful on the baking sheet but it took up way too much space; I guess you could dump it all in a bowl but it just wouldn'tl ook as nice. Lastly next time I'll add some chicken for my husband who refused to eat vegetables unless there is an equitable representation of protein in the dish!:) Thanks for a great recipe.",
