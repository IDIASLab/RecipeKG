The rice is lovely...the flavor is subtle against your chicken and the sauce but is definitely the base of the dish from which all the other flavors build. The chicken is marinated perfectly and I love that you don't need to marinate it longer than this recipe takes to make up until you cook it. The cucumbers offer a great fresh addition to the dish as does the cilantro. I am so impressed with the homemade sauce as well...it's AWESOME. Had a viewing party of the show and served both this dish and Troys and had the guests choose which dish one and yours was the overwhelming winner just as the judges decided. NICE JOB CooksInHeels looking forward to more amazing and great things from you in the food industry!",
