The mix was easy to use tasted great was more affordable than I expected and the best part was not having to worry about adding additional seasonings and etc. The only thing I changed was using frozen corn instead of canned. I roasted the corn on the stove before putting it in the guacamole. We will definitely be adding this to our recipe rotation.",
