We loved that there was a lot of \"juice\" that we could soak up with some crusty bread. The flavors in this just worked! My Italian hubby made one suggestion which I will do when I make this again and that's to take the pasta out of the water a couple of minutes before it's \"al dente\" and finish the cooking of the pasta right in the pan with the clams and shrimp. Really nice recipe!",

I was concerned that either the pesto or the clam flavor would overpower the dish but neither of them did. It was a perfect balance. This recipe is easy and quick enough to whip up on a weeknight and also one that is worthy enough to serve guests. It is impressive both in taste and in presentation.",
