I could not find jicama so used radishes instead and I forgot the basil but feel it may have been a bit out of place anyway.  I also added diced pepper jack cheese which added a nice kick and topped with crushed tortilla chips.  I was worried that I would miss having dressing but didn't!  The lime juice was perfect and enhanced all the other fresh flavors!  Will definitely make again and again!",
