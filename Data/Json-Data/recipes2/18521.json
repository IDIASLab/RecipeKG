Don't use more sun-dried tomatoes than the recipe states b/c the taste will overwhelm the artichokes keep it in balance. And finally I prefer cooking dips like this in a small crockpot because it keeps it warm during the party rather than allowing to cool. I served with garlic crostini (good basic recipe is on this site).",
