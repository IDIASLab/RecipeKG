I would not make them with those herbs again (esp the sage) but I did like the technique used to cook them. I also don t like when the amount of salt and pepper is to taste. I need a specific amount listed and then I prefer to adjust up or down to my preference. I had no idea how much salt to add and didn t add enough so a suggested starting point would have been nice so as to not end up with bland potatoes. Also the larger fingerling potatoes were not ready in 20min and I had to put them in my oven for an additional 8 min.",
