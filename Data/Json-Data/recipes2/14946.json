As long as you have ice cream in the freezer you're set for a spontaneous dessert since I'm sure most home kitchens generally have these few simple ingredients on hand. I used half and half rather than evaporated milk and a teaspoon of vanilla. I did not add the nuts preferring just a smooth sauce. I served this over brownies and vanilla ice cream. Delicious. A very worthy use of a bag of chocolate chips!",

The sauce doesn't harden like a crackle topping--it firms up nicely and is delicious. This will be a repeat at our house. Thanks for sharing Susan.",

I did only 1/2 recipe and got about 4 servings so unless you eat a lot of topping on ice-cream it is actually double the servings suggested. I melted the chocolate chips in the microwave on high for about 1 minute stirring after 30 seconds and then stirred in the rest of the ingredients. The sauce without the nuts reminded me so much of \"Magic Shell.\" I did try it on some ice-cream and it firmed up some slightly after about 3 minutes. But I can't ever get magic shell to the crack stage because I am too impatient to! I wish this would have said pecans (optional). I may try to make again in the future without them and report back. Defintely a very rich ice-cream topping!",
