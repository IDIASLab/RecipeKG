I give small precious jars to neighbors during holiday season. It is delicious! They all love it. And, as a bonus, yuzus are very fragrant, so it not only tastes good but it smells lovely. It's fiddly to prepare because yuzus have many pips, but worth it. I recommend adding the pips in a muslin bag to the boil mix, and I find I don't need added pectin.",
