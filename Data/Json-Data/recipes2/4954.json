I've never used canned chili before but would use it again to make this dip in a pinch. If I were to make this again I'd sub sour cream for the milk in the base as the milk made it to watery for my preference. I'd also prefer chili WITH beans but it works without too. I served this with Fritos Scoops and tortilla chips and it was well received. THANKS for the recipe and the chili Hormel!",

I was able to cut the recipe in half and make this as an appetizer for my husband and I to share. I recommend cutting the milk in half because the cheese cream cheese and milk mixture was on the soft side and a little tricky to blend with so much milk. Make sure you add a drizzle of taco or hot sauce to the top before serving for an extra punch of flavor. I never thought to use chili in a layered taco dip but this is something to keep on hand in case I'm in a pinch and need to whip up an appetizer quickly. I would definitely make this recipe again.",

I think next time I will microwave both the cream cheese layer and the chili layer for a more gooey type dip.
