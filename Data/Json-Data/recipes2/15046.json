It is a fancy style of bacon that is made from the same cuts as standard bacon but is generally more expensive and curred over a longer period of time using salt. Regular bacon will suffice. This recipe was interesting and had good flavor but lacked the kick I usually look for. I DO recommend everyone trying this at least once. This will not be a part of my regular rotation.",

I'm pretty sure that the reviewers who said that the 2 tbp. olive oil was a typo & that balsamic vinegar should be used instaed are correct but I love browned butter & took the suggestion to add 2 tbp. of that (in addition to the balsamic vinegar.) I also added some minced garlic & some italian seasoning. This was far from bland...even my 3 year old grandson liked it. But he has a sophisticated palate for his age & he is very appreciative of anything we cook together. All in all it was a nice change of pace for lunch.",
