I did make some adjustments and improvs to it but followed the recipe in general. \n\nFirst of all, I used a rolled/tied pork roast instead of the pork tenderloin.  When I took the pork roast out of the string mesh, it was already split about in half so what I ended up with was basically two halves of a pork roast. What I did was place them in large baking pan with space in between for the stuffing. I put the stuffing in the center space, pushed everything together a little and covered it all with the bacon slices. \n\nFor the stuffing mix, I added the bacon crumbles, diced apples and some diced yams. (It was fantastic-my daughter is not a stuffing person and she gave it huge thumbs up!)\n\nBecause I used a larger pork roast, it did need to roast longer- I cooked it covered with foil for about  1 hour then added remaining apple chunks and yams with a small amount of spiced apple cider over them. Recovered, baked for another 1/2 hour then removed foil and baked for additional 20 minutes. Be sure to use meat thermometer so you don't over cook it! I turned out fantastic!",

It was actually very juicy because I cooked it for 40 minutes and let carryover cooking do the rest. Made a few changes based on preferences and what I had in the house: 1. Plain pork loin butterflied and pounded to 1/2\" thick then sprinkled with salt pepper and granulated garlic and onion. 2. Omitted pecans and used dried cherries. 3. Omitted butter and used all the bacon fat. 4. Once I removed the bacon I sauteed onions and garlic before adding apples cherries stuffing etc to pan. 5. Used apple juice instead of apple cider. Fiance's suggestions were to remove the cherries use more stuffing and sprinkle with brown sugar before putting it in the oven. Will try again with his ideas and see how it goes. I enjoyed the flavor immensely and will be doing this again using a dark meat like duck breast or chicken thighs.",
