Didn t add the vanilla as I don t like the taste. My smoothie maker emulsified the ice so it was more of a cold drink. Next time I will use frozen bananas and blend a little less so it has more of a frozen consistency! Thanks so much for a great recipe! Can t wait to make again. Love a good protein smoothie that is all natural and affordable!",
