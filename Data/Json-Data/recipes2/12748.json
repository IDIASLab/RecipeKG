Can be served with veggies, but I liked it best with Triscuits&reg;. I was surprised by this dip. I only tried it because of the crackers. For better flavor, make the day before so the flavors can meld. Can also be made by leaving out bacon and adding 1/2 cup slivered almonds or finely chopped pecans.",

I've been making this for years and only things different are using mayo instead of miricle whip ( and I eat my actual BLT's with miricle whip) and using real bacon. I also don't add cheese but thats cause I don't eat cheese on my BLT's. When I was introduced to this the girl that brought this dip used toasted bread triangles which was the best way to serve this dip but who wants to sit there and toast a whole loaf of bread crackers is what I always serve it with.",
