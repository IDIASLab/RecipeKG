The next time I blended the ingredients one at a time. I first added kale and some orange juice. Next I added the frozen banana pieces 2 at a time. This was followed by the flax seed coconut oil and finally the milk. I recommend 2-3x the amount of OJ and milk that the recipe requires otherwise it is just way too thick. I am going to melt the coconut oil next time as another reviewer mentioned. Adding avocado is also interesting.",

I melted the coconut oil so it would blend better with the other ingredients. I also used nonfat milk and Simply Orange 100% orange juice.
