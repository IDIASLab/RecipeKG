First, heat to 180 f  then cool to 110-120f.  add your yogurt culture mixing very well.  Keep around 110f for about 10 hours (I use my oven on the bread proofer cycle.  Towels & a heating pad work great too)\nI like my Greek yogurt very thick so I pour my yogurt into a kitchen strainer lined with 2 huge coffee filters (gallon size commercial BUNN -AMAZON has them) and strain on the counter  for 4 to 6 hours.  It wont go bad because of the high acidic content.  Keep the whey for yummy homemade soup or smoothies.  I whip my finished yogurt and store in glass mason jars (keeps best in glass).   Save some to start your next batch but if you're not making more within a week, freeze the reserved yogurt and take out of the freezer when needed.  I've even used mine frozen but it takes much longer to mix it thoroughly int o your 115f milk.\nThere are so many variables, each can change your yogurt results in some way.\none important note of caution, heating to 180f changes protein structure  and gives culture (a bacteria) a clean slate in which to grow.  Adding anything (the cream for example) after it has cooled introduces a competing bacteria back into the batch which could possibly contaminate it.  If using the cream, add it to the milk then heat it to 180f., cool and innoculate with the yogurt culture.",

Mom's culture died out before she passed years back and I've been too lazy to start a new starter. This motivated me. I currently buy Mountain Hye. Not bad but NOTHING like homemade. My Kids will thank you also! Anyone reading this this recipe makes \"The Kind\". If you prefer a more tart yogurt as does my family literally leave it out in a warm spot until desired tartness is achieved. Excellent for dressings sauces marinades. Add fruit a bit of vanilla and a sprinkling of sugar or Splenda (I'm diabetic) for a wonderful dessert or plain with crackers broken up in it as do we.",
