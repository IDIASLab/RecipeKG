I had used the cheese powder packet for another recipe/experiment. Same noodle but no elbow basically. I did not buy the fresh basil (even though it would have been better) but used the dried. With that being said, this was really tomato forward and chunky tomato forward at that . Next time I would flop the crushed and diced tomatoes around for a smoother texture. Overall good recipe and one I would make again.",
