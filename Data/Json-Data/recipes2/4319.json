Also I think a bit of garlic powder touch of salt and pepper would improve this recipe. Overall though a keeper.",

Instead of blending everything I just chopped the spinach and whisked it all together; I like the texture of seperate ingredients rather than all the same. I also substituted chicken breast for the ham. Lower calories and my kids prefer chicken to ham anyway. I also used a round pie plate rather than a 9x13 pan; it takes significantly longer to bake this way so modify your cooking times appropriately. Another great recipe!!",

I mixed the baking mix milk and eggs separately and then stirred everything together so as to get a more chunky texture. Added the ham and cheese on top of the 9 x 9 glass dish. I cooked it 35 mins @ 325 and an additional 15 mins @ 350 because it was totally jiggly!",
