I cubed it marinated it in the fajita seasoning and then stir-fryed it. I added the diced peppers towards the end (rather than adding raw to the lettuce). Let's see...I also skipped that anchovies.:) One last thing be careful when reading the \"1 canned chipotle pepper\". I almost read it as \"1 can of chipotle peppers\"!! Whoa!! That would'a been bad.
