                "reviewBody": "After experimenting with this recipe a few times, and reading the tips from other reviewers, I think I have it down.  Here is what I have come up with to make the recipe easier to work with.  For starters, I mix everything in my kitchen aid mixer.  I find that I need 1/2 cup less sugar then the recipe calls for to get the perfect consistancy.  When the \"dough\" is combined well I roll it out on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and put it in the freezer for about 1/2 hour.  (NOTE: If you are going to do patties it is actually easier to leave them at room temperature to harden up because the frozen dough reacts too quickly with the hot melted chocolate and breaks down very easily.  The room temperature dough does not react as quickly and therefore does not break down very fast.) Another problem I ran into was getting the chocolate mixture to be the correct consistancy.  I found it was easier to work with if it is more liquid like - done by adding a very small amount of milk or cream.  Once the chocolate is the correct consistancy I brushed it onto the rolled peppermint mixture and returned it to the freezer.  I then applied a second coat after the chocolate had set and again returned it to the freezer.  Flip it over and repeat.  Once the whole thing is set it is very easy to cut it into squares or even to use a round cookie cutter to make circular shapes.  The candy is to die for and worth all the work involved in its creation.",

This combination of condensed milk and powdered sugar is just the best!  It makes a fantastic dough which is really easy to manipulate.  Rather than form them into balls individually, I roll out the dough and cut out the patties with a cookie cutter.  You can stick to rounds or use something pretty like a heart.  I definitely recommend following the suggestion to freeze before dipping in chocolate.  I'll never buy peppermint patties from the store again - these are great and far cheaper!",

I've been making these for 5 years now and have given them away in gift baskets along with the recipe on a nicely decorated recipe card for Christmas. What a HIT!  They are so light and refreshing for an after dinner sweet. Served best directly from the freezer.  Also a couple of tips...when kneading the dough use powdered sugar on the silpat or countertop NOT corn starch and do not cut the sugar as it changes the consistency and makes it much harder to dip successfully.  When the chocolate starts to get lumpy from cooling reheat and add a little more shortening until smooth again.  I find it easier to dip \"frozen\" patties with tongs rather than forks, just don't submerge patties for too long and you can always cool and double dip for better coverage.  These goodies are worth their weight in gold so don't get discouraged or give up! :)",
