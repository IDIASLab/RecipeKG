I will say if I made this again I would not do it all in one pot. I had to add more water to cook the pasta and once it did cook I had an issue with it sticking to the bottom. I think I would have rather just boiled and drained it as normal. Also I added garlic and olive oil while cooking and stirred in mozzarella as the cheese (turned into a little more of a caprese pasta). I also marinated the chicken prior to cooking. This recipe is a good springboard to start with but I think it could use a little more flavor and rely a little less on the balsamic.",
