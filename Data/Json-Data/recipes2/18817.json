The mixture of vegetables, eggs, peppers and tomato sauce gives it color, besides some protein. You might like the taste better than the looks of it. Give it a shot, it won't kill yah!!",

First off, I sauteed garlic and onion in olive oil, when that browned I added one small zucchini and one small summer squash, chopped.  I didn't have a red pepper, but I did add a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce. This added a nice smoky flavor, along with a little heat.  I used egg whites and salsa instead of the tomato sauce, I didn't have any... Then when it was all done I topped with a little shredded cheddar cheese.  Ummm Ummm good!",

Unusual dish.\" Well I salvaged my leftovers by mixing them into omelets for the next day's breakfast b/c the 2 eggs in this just got lost amongst the veggies. The scrambled egg & tomato sauce became a kind of clumpy shade of \"brain\" pink making this not the most attractive meal but it was a great way to use the chubby zucchini that I'd just plucked from the garden. If I made this again I'd swap tomato sauce for diced tomato add minced garlic S&P (I had to eat mine w/ considerable splashes of Sriracha due to its ho-hum taste) and increase the eggs.",
