First time using a mandolin slicer so of course took a piece off my finger.  Duh!  Tasted awesome. The potatoes tasted awesome, not my finger!\n\nOnly issue I had is that it took longer to cook than what is included in recipe. The potatoes were done in an hour but there was still a lot of juice in the casserole dish. So nuked it for 10 minutes and that seemed to solve the problem.  Will make this again for sure.",
