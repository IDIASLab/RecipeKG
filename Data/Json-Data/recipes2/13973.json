I also spark up the spuds with some dry ranch flavoring or use a little green onion.  I have also added layers of extra-sharp cheddar or kraut.  If you use the kraut, rinse it first to remove some of the salt, then dry or skillet it to add a little crunch.  As for the noodles, I just used a little butter flavor Pam and it does the trick with at least a little less fat.  Use neufchatel for even less and a margarine sub.  works just fine.",

I however like it the way it is but might try it with keibasa or bacon some time. I think a good layer of onions makes this dish great.
