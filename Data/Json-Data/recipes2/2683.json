Add a mashed banana or a few tablespoons of applesauce to the mix for added sweetness and flavor. Add fresh berries or crushed nuts to the mix if you wish for even more variety. Of course, finish it off with a drizzle of maple syrup for an amazing dairy-free, egg-free, vegan breakfast.",

However, if you leave it out you will need to compensate with some more flour as it will be runnier. I used gluten free rice flour and gluten free bread. In each of my batches I used almond milk. I was able to use 8 pieces of sandwich bread with the original recipe. Quite delicious, thank you HeatherMonroe for the recipe.",
