Our son was home from college with a group so I had to multiply and as the number changed, I changed the principle method of cooking the chicken from pan to oven.  The only thing I would change is how to handle the cheese.  Camembert is very similar to Brie which could be used.  I wasn't sure how to handle the corn starch skin.  I reasoned the corn starch would become incorporated and add to the thickening.  It didn't.  The next time I thought I would heat the cheese separately and add it to the green onion butter mixture, don't. Next time I'll trim the cheese \"skin\" and have a snack while cooking.  This recipe is a keeper, quick easy and kinda fancy.",

The \"star\" of this recipe, is the avocado, so I wouldn't skip that. Nicole Jansen, this is excellent! If I wasn't doing low-carb, I wouldn't of changed a thing; esp. the Camembert.

In some of the reviews some said it was too mild -- if that's the case definitely use the camembert and NOT brie as camembert has a stronger flavor. And you could just add a bit more of the cheese. I had problems with the flour leaving lumps... probably my fault since I'm not good at flour mixtures. As with other reviewers I found the avocado to be the highlight of the dish. Also I just used frozen breaded chicken from Costco and cooked it in the oven served the sauce on top. Worked great!",
