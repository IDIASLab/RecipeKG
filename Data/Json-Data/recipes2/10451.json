I halved the recipe to only make one sandwich and used Tuscan bread yellow American cheese and a bit of dried basil b/c I had no fresh (will have to try it that way next time). The flavor combination in this sandwich is wonderful and I LOVED LOVED LOVED the addition of the pepper flakes! I sort of just eyeballed all of the seasonings b/c frankly I didn't feel like busting out the measuring spoons lol. This would be great w/ any cheese combo IMO. I love finding new sandwich/grilled cheese recipes to try and this one is a definite keeper YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

Switched up cheese a little (swiss instead of provalone added sharp cheddar) because of what I had on hand. It made a fabulous sandwich. On nom mom... Will be making variations on this for a while. I think the basil and avocado are what make this stand out as a different take on grilled cheese... I've been making them with my own changes for a long time. But hadn't considered that. Silly me.

I also used the wheat bread as suggested but think a white Italian or French bread would have been better. It was good and filling but quite a lot going on in the sandwich. The only other change I made was using low-fat dairy products. I added up the calories as I made it and it came to 360 so the 672 seems to be a bit off. I ate this for lunch today but I have had other flavored grilled cheese from the site that I liked much better.",
