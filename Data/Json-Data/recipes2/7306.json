I did make one change and that is that I used lil smokies in place of the link sausage but I only did that because we do not care for breakfast sausage. It is common here in Arkansas to cook lil smokies in bbq sauce and grape jelly so it only made sense. I'm sure breakfast sausage would be great in this if you like it. The one change I will make when I fix these again is that I will pre-cook the bacon a little bit before assembling the skewers. I like my bacon crisp and I cooked it as long as I could without burning everything else and it still wasn't quite as crisp as I like but that is just a personal preference. These were fun and something I will definitely make again!",
