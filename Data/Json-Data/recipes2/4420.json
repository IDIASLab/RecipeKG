I did season my egg w/ garlic powder and seasoned salt and used seasoned breadcrumbs which made these very flavorful. These cooked up in a flash and were gone just as quick. Oh BTW I got more than 12 out of this recipe...more like 25 or so (just a heads up)... Will be making these again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
