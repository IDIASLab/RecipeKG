I tried a little with the almond exract, but preferred it without. For some reason, when I was done with the layers I still had half of the graham crumbs left. My crumbs wouldn't come together, and think maybe they were expiring. I used 1/2, but honestly think I would have preferred much less. I liked the combination of the flavors of the sweetened ricotta, peaches, and chocolate. I would not have thought to put those flavors together and liked how it wasn't too sweet. The 3 together, only, with a little lite whipped topping would have been fine to me. Now, I just have to figure out what else to do with this ricotta cheese? I never have bought it before, it's actually not too bad.",

I doubled the mixture and mine turned out a bit runny but I used whole ricotta cheese because thats what I had and it was pretty runny (I blame the ingredient swap) so I threw in about 4oz of cream cheese to make it firm enough no problem after that. I also wasn't crazy about the idea of putting the chocolate on top of the peaches so I packed down all the crumbs into a pie dish and topped with the chocolate threw it in the oven enough to soften it and spread it around the crumbs it turned out kinda like a chocolate coated cannoli shell. It was loved by the entire family and really impressive looking for how easy it is to throw together I can't wait to try it with other fruit combinations.",

I made a few alterations....I used whole milk ricotta (I always do), doubled the ricotta and vanilla but only 1/3 C sugar and kept the almond extract at a shy 1/2 tsp.  I used the 1/2 C graham crumbs but added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and used grated dark chocolate on all the layers and topped with sliced fresh strawberries. This is an wonderfully adaptable recipe and can be used as a base for many fruits by changing the spice/ flavoring!  Thanks for sharing Lillian.",
