                "reviewBody": "The flavor of this recipe came out very well. The sweetness of the lychees really complemented the salty spicy flavors from the sauce/marinade ingredients. This recipe would be very easy to tweak to adjust for your own personal preferences on salt and spice. (For example I think you could eliminate the soy sauce altogether and not miss if it you're trying to cut down on salt.) I didn't have chile peppers but had some Asian chili garlic sauce so I cut back on the minced garlic (used 1/2 tbsp) to account for the garlic in the chili sauce. One thing I did not like about this recipe however was that there was a lot of liquid in the pan when everything was done cooking. So I dissolved some cornstarch in water and mixed that into the boiling liquid to thicken the liquid into a nice sauce. I then mixed the cooked meat/lychee mixture back into the thickened liquid and served it over rice. I will definitely make this again but next time I think I will just mix the second tablespoon of wine with a tablespoon of cornstarch and mix that in at the very end instead of adding the wine to the pan while the turkey is cooking.",
