It is never white like the picture.  Also, the recipe originally called for jalapeno peppers (fresh, not pickled).  I have since found that serrano peppers work much better.  I do not seed them, just toss them in the blender.  Depending on how much heat you want, I usually use about 3 small ones.\n\nWhen I could not locate my original recipe, I turned to all recipes since I knew I had posted it here.  After measuring out all ingredients as listed, I realized something was WRONG.  The quantity just did not look right.  Eventually, I found the original.  It called for 1 PINT, not 1 CUP of mayo.\nWe normally make it with 1 cup of mayo and 1 cup of salad dressing.  I am sorry for the mistake.  I am glad those who tried it were not disappointed, but try it again using the additional mayo.  It makes it to further and will have a smoother texture.  Otherwise, for those of you who prefer it the other way, go for it !    Thanks for trying it!",

The other is that the real original used a tiny pepper called a chile petin instead of jalepenos or serranos. The last comment is that the real product takes on a light beige color rather than being so white so I feel the amount of Ritz crackers may be off slightly. The consistency is very thick and 'spreadable' rather than easily dippable. Once you try it you will remember the taste and texture forever and will as I have try to reproduce it unsuccesfully.",
