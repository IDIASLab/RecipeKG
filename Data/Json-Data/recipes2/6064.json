It was good but I think I prefer oatmeal to quinoa (at least in this instance). Apricots were too expensive so I used raisins and blueberries instead. The only thing I would change would be to add more cinnamon and honey (or sugar) because those flavors were a little too understated for me. Again the lower rating comes more from the fact that I did not care for the texture of quinoa in a \"breakfast cereal.\"",
