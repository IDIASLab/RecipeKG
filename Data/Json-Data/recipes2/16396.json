I used half of the penne suggested, but the full amount of olive oil. I also kept the amounts of garlic, parsely and black pepper the same. I quadrupled the amount of sun dried tomato, and added two freshly sliced mushrooms. After I sauteed the mix and added the pasta, I then added about 2 Tbsp fresh basil. The end result was phenomenal. Thank you for the stepping stone!",

I also did not want to change up the vegies as I wanted a clean fresh simple pasta but I did double it. I used Roma tomatoes instead of Sundried. I also sauted the garlic in olive oil with parsley.. threw in the vegies then added minced onion and itialian seasoning. I put that mixture aside when I felt it was ready and took my cooked pasta and sauted it on the skillet with some olive oil and garlic powder to get it a little crisp and absorb some flavor so it was not so bland as it is wheat pasta. Mixed it all together added crushed red pepper and fresh parmesan shavings and it was delish!:)",
