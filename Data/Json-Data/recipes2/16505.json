I cut the recipe in half because I knew this was going to be a lot of cheese spread. I used light cream cheese, 5 oz. of light feta cheese, minced garlic from a jar, and 2 & 1/2 tsp. of dried dill. This is one of those recipes that you have to play with to suit your tastes so go crazy. This was especially good on bagel chips!",

I liked the idea of chunks to give it a bit of texture. Great recipe!",
