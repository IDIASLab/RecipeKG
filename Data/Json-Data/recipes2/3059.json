The store was out of the Uncle Ben's Ready Rice Long Grain so I used Uncle Ben's Ready Rice Jasmine. Couldn't find blood orange white balsamic vinegar so I used Trader Joe's Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar for the vinaigrette (worked for me!). Interesting combination with that little bit of mayonnaise coating the rice so nicely and then tossed with the orange vinaigrette at the end. You get a nice pop of sweetness from the cranberries and a little crunch from the celery and pecans. All layers of flavor are in harmony with not one dominating. Would't change a thing in this recipe it was delicious today served with grilled fresh Gulf shrimp. Marianne thanks for creating this recipe thumbs up!!",
