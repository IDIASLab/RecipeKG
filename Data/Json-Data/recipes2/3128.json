I made only very slight variations - we didn t have sherry vinegar so used rice vinegar (as suggested by thestonesoup.com) and we had only one bunch of radishes from the CSA so we used a bunch of CSA carrots in addition. Paired with boiled potatoes it was such a lovely date night dinner. Regarding the person who made this with PORK and then gave it 4 stars: I really wish people would only post reviews when they have actually made the recipe with at most only very slight variations. Exchanging one bunch of radishes for carrots for example is very different than using a completely different kind of meat. Allrecipes only works if you actually review the recipe as it s posted!",

Very delicious combination, and the cooking time doesn't cause the radishes to break down. Whole, they softened to perfection. I did add onions, and a few other spring vegetables that I wanted to use up. The spice combination is very good. I didn't use the oven, I braised this at different temperatures mimicking the temperatures and times listed here. I also used a different cut of lamb, and it came out fork tender and perfect. I love the fat content and wasn't unhappy about separation. It's lamb! If you are using high quality, grass fed lamb, the ratio of omega-3's make the fats beneficial.",
