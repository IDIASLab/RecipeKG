Use raw chicken, cut it from the bone, and boil the meat and bone for a while. I used about one bone for each cup of broth I needed to make. Since I didn't have enough bones, I combined my homemade stock with store-bought stock.  2. Add a star anise while the bones simmer. It makes the soup more savory.  3. Offer cilantro, chili paste, and lime as garnish options.  I would also recommend using a little more bean sprouts and bok choy than this calls for. Some might prefer a little less chicken. If you like your bean sprouts crispy at all, only use them as garnish; don't simmer them at all.",

I had most of the ingredients on hand for this (I live in California and my lemon grass grows in the front yard) and fixed it for dinner tonight.  Only thing I didn't have was the bean sprouts, and although they would have been a nice addition, the soup didn't need them.  This soup, although intensely flavorful, is not particularly spicy - if you are looking for hot, slice in some of those green Thai chilis or add some red pepper flakes.  I think this would be good over Udon noodles also.  Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE: I used homemade chicken stock (simmer the bones from rotisserie chicken in water or chicken broth to cover with vegetable trimmings  - carrots, onions, celery - garlic, wine or vinegar, covered overnight on low, strain). Easy and delicious (salt as desired).  Lemon grass should be left in 2\" chunks and bruised, as it is just for flavor and not to be eaten.",
