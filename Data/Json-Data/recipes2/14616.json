I followed the recipe exactly and got a really tasty and fresh bread with a nicely balanced cheese flavor throughout. The loaf lasted about 4 days just wrapped in cling film on the counter. We cut from it as needed. It went well with several meals I cooked that week. It really mixes well with soups. We had a buttered slice with both Corn Chowder and French Onion. If you are afraid of baking bread try this recipe. It's easy and it works!",

It is very different from other yeast bread recipes (more of a batter than a dough and the resulting loaf looked more like a quick bread than a regular yeast bread). I cut the recipe in half to make one loaf and used 1 and 3/4tsp of yeast. Also I heated the milk in the microwave for 30 seconds so that it was slightly warm used margarine instead of butter and baked for 40 minutes. If you like romano cheese then you will love this bread because it is so cheesy tasting. It also makes terrific toast.",
