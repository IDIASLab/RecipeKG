Make these for your taco Tuesday get-together. Even your most carnivore of carnivores will like them. They are a bit spicy so I suggest going easy on the chipotles and add them on the side for those who like it hot. I didn't mash the lentils and enjoyed having them to bite into. The sauce thickens enough to keep it all together. Thank you for the recipe.",

Unfortunately, as is it is missing key instructions and information, such as the ratio of dry to cooked lentils and how exactly one goes about cooking them, it took me an hour longer than it should have to make this, and once it was done it was unusable. I am somewhat new to lentils, and outside vegan circles, so are most people. Without instructions as to how to manage this massive chunk of the cooking, the recipe is useless.",

Like another reviewer mentioned, I am going to mix up some of the dry spice mix to have handy for other dishes. I added some turmeric because I sneak it into a lot of dishes anyway.
