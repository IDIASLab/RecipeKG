My kids really liked this for an after school snack.",

I know some people said they thought the tomato paste was too much. There's plenty on it but I liked it that way. I wasn't able to get the dough into a true circle but it didn't really matter to me. I put grated parm cheese on the last 15 minutes and didn't have any problems with it burning. Served it with marinated chicken and grilled sweet potatoes yukon gold potatoes and carrots. Perfect.
