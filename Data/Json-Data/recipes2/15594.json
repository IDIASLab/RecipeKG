HOWEVER, this chicken dish, is truly one of the best I've ever eaten! The different ingredients flavored this dish beautifully and it is certainly elegant enough for a dinner party.

I wasn't too sure at first as to how this combination of ingredients would fly, but as others have already said, all of the flavors complimented eachother and the results were delicious. I used a lot more cheese, and I had to use a red pepper instead of a green. Served with buttered egg noodles and lots of parm. Thank you.",

Marinating the chicken breasts in a Lemon Dijon Vinaigrette was a better fit for us.  I find baking boneless chicken breasts at a higher temperature keeps them tender and moist, so after baking them for 20 minutes at 400 degrees, I topped them with the vegetables and just a little shredded mozzarella (we didn\u2019t want a whole lot of cheese on the chicken) and returned them to the oven briefly, just long enough to melt the cheese. Nice recipe \u2013 we really enjoyed it!",

I will say that this is an extremely filling meal and probably should be prepared for a groups of very hungry people.  I mean, it has bacon, cheese, chicken - it is rich and hearty.
