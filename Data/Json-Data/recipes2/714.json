We liked her idea of using 2 oz of everything. We used fat free half and half to cut down on the calories and it still tasted great! We even added a tablespoon of cream of coconut that so many other recipes calls for. It's easy and tastes delicious!!",

It filled my martini glass up to the rim:) I didn't have any vanilla flavored vodka so I added a splash of vanilla extract to Sky vodka instead. It worked just fine. I didn't have any trouble with the cream separating but I also keep my martini glass and shaker in the freezer until I need it. I'm not sure if that makes a difference. My drink also turned out white in color as opposed to the clear martini pictured in the recipe. Anyhow I would recommend this drink to anyone who enjoys key lime pie. It tastes just like it!",

I couldn't find key lime juice so I bought the cheap green plastic lime juice for.80 and couldn't tell a difference. Thanks for sharing!",
