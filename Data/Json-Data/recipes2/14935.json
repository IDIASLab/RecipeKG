Salad tends to be a bit \"heavy\" containing a lot of meat and cheese. Too much cheese I feel. My local deli sells a similar salad and I've been searching for the recipe. But in comparing the two I prefer the deli's version. To make it like theirs next time I'll substitute salami for half of the pepperoni omit the swiss cheese and add one can of drained garbanzo beans and add some shredded carrots for extra color. I'll make this again with the alterations I've stated. Thanks for the recipe! Now I can duplicate my deli's salad!",
