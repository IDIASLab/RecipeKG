I've made this exactly as written except that I didn't think I had a skillet large enough for this dish so I used a large pot with a glass lid. I sauteed the veggies for the full 3 minutes even though I didn't think this step would do much for the recipe. Oh and I seeded the bell pepper but not the jalape\u00f1o. And I cooked the whole dish for 30 minutes. This dish kind of grew on me. It's pretty easy to make and the pork chops cook well and taste pretty good. The sauce isn't spicy enough for me - in fact I found it surprisingly mild given the spicy ingredients. But I'd still recommend this as a quick easy tasty and spicy pork chop recipe. Thanks!",

My husband and I love spicy foods but I'm glad I reduced the red pepper. Otherwise it was very good. I made a few substitutions to use what I had on hand but no drastic changes. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and tomato sauce instead of tomato puree and I used thin pork chops instead of thick pork chops. Overall the dish had a great flavor but would be very spicy as written. However it is an easy spicy healthy quick one-dish meal that is only 4 weight watchers points. Next time I will cut back on the crushed red pepper and it will be a 5-star recipe!",
