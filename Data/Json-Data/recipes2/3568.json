There are so many things I can't eat, I was about to despair of ever figuring out anything tasty I could cook. After much browsing, I came up with this fabulous recipe. All of my friends now make this recipe, so it's not just for heartburn sufferers! Of course, you can always add garlic or onion, but I guarantee you won't miss them! I usually use chicken thighs and the only sausage I can eat is bratwurst, but Italian would be yummy, of course.",

I never EVER cook sausages in oil. I pierce them with a fork (you must pierce or like a baked potato they will explode!) add a bit of water to the pan with the sausages then cover and cook for about 5 min. or so. (You do this so the insides get a head start on cooking and you don't have to over-fry them.) Then I drain the water and continue to cook (fry) uncovered until they are browned and well cooked. This should solve the problem of too 'greasy'. As we are spice lovers we did indeed add garlic onions that we caramelized and sweet peppers.",

The browning process is time consuming, but recipe times were spot on.  I placed the potatoes in the bottom of my baking dish, then topped with the chicken and the sausage.  I stirred the potatoes and turned the chicken and sausage twice during the baking process.  I drizzled with real red wine, instead of red wine vinegar.  I think you can probably leave off the drizzle of oil, as everything is pre-cooked in oil, and mine came out too greasy.  I had to sop up some of the grease with a paper towel before serving.
