This was a quick and perfect way to use this fruit up before I head for home tomorrow.  I didn't have any yogurt, and prefer to make drinks like this with vanilla ice ceam anyway. It really was delicious, and what an attractive color! I don't know, however,  that the kiwi necessarily contributed much in flavor.  Besides, kiwi is so pretty it was almost a shame to just blend it up in a smoothie.  Using the ice cream it was just sweet enough, so I wonder if this might not need some sugar if using yogurt.  I'm not sure I'd make a point to make these again, but in this instance, given the fruit I had on hand,  it was a choice I enjoyed.",

I do like the blueberry ones. I have to agree that the kiwi didn't add a lot to it but kiwi and banana both are ones I prefer to have as a more subtle flavor anyway. And purple drinks are always pretty. My only issue with this is that it's harder to mix smooth. I have to put ice in first or my blender doesn't handle it. But unless I just let the ice melt there's no liquid at all. I just keep scraping the sides to try throwing that fruit down in the center and eventually it does mix up and then I smoothed it out once the yogurt was added - but a bit of a hassle.",
