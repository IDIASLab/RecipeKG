Next time I will remove the chard stems all the way up into the leaves and not just chop off the bottom parts - this was my very first chard cooking experience so this may have been a novice mistake. The pieces were huge! Also if I am unable to find pre-pitted olives I'm just not going to make this. I greatly underestimated the work involved in pitting so many olives.",
