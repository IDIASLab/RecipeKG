When I first do a version of a classic dish like paella, I try to use a minimum number of ingredients and steps to focus on technique. After learning the method, you'll ideally use a wider variety of ingredients, like clams, mussels, squid, and chicken, which will make your rice that much more interesting. Garnish with extra virgin olive oil, freshly chopped flat-leaf parsley, and lemon wedges.",

Otherwise, I followed the recipe and technique exactly. This recipe was awesome! I was a little worried about shrimp being overdone at 20 minutes in the oven, it was fine but don't leave it in any longer. Don't skimp on simmering the shells with the broth, this added a lot of flavor! Saffron is pricey but please invest if you can. It does make a difference. The rice in the dish comes out slightly firm, it is not runny or creamy like risotto, it is nice and fluffy. I used a cast iron skillet. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!",

I am 60 years old.  before my wife had a stroke 8 years ago we took turns, I cooked the meals half the time. I have cooked all the meals since then.  The meals that count, that I can take some time with are usually Sunday night.  The store I shop at doesn't sell Saffron, I had to go to a second store to get the saffron. I couldn't fine the arborior rice so I used Jasmine rice.  I have never cooked with saffron or used the shrimp shells to make a stock. I make decent meals every day but this was off the charts .

I will be adding this recipe to my list of dinner meals and will likely add mussels clams and squid in the future.",

Followed the recipe almost exactly only used green bell pepper instead of red and kielbasa sausage for the Spanish chorizo. Also I had to add a little water after taking it out of the oven (but maybe that was because I ended up with a bit less than the 2 cups of prepared broth it calls for in the beginning). I then covered my pan with its lid and cooked it on low for about 5 minutes and got those bits of golden caramelized rice Chef John's mentions in the video. This was really easy for a very tasty meal and also the cleanup was a breeze:) Thank you Chef John! Update: the second & third times I made this (within a month;) ) I added 1 lb. shoulder pork in pieces (previously cooked in a separate pan and seasoned with salt & pepper). I also didn't have chicken broth so used water with 1/4 onion 3 cloves of garlic and 1/2 tsp salt. I also doubled the saffron (used 1 tsp). added a handful of green beans and used 1 whole cup of peas it was delicious!",

I thought 20 minutes in the oven with shrimp was a little too long. I should have added them in the last 10 minutes of cooking. The flavor was great with the saffron and shrimp tail broth that was made.",
