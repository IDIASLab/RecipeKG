I added extra bean sprouts and about 5 oz of choipped water chestnuts. I also added an extra teaspoon of soy sauce to each serving. The water chestnuts really helped to keep this from being too bland. I will definitly make this again but with my modifications. The portion sizes were pretty decent and I felt they were very filling.",

This was very, very tasty and filling with my adaptation to the sauce:  I used 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon mirin and 1 tablespoon chili and garlic sauce.  I dissolved about 1/2 tsp of cornstarch in the soy sauce, mixed the sauce ingredients and then added to the sauteed but still crisp veggies.  Then added cooked angel hair pasta and simmered for a few minutes.  The taste was a 5 but I'm rating this 4 because I added.",
