I made these for April Fools this year, using Pillsbury Orangesicle frosting for the \"cheese\" and the Buttermilk Pound Cake II recipe from this site for the bread.  That bread is a bit crumbly for this application, but with some careful handling, it still made for a very fun presentation--plus the orangesicle complements plain pound cake perfectly!  Highly recommended project for your little ones--mine both loved it!",
