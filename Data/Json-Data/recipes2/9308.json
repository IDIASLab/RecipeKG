I originally thought 15-20 min sounded long for shrimp as well but actually ended up cooking even a bit longer for the liquids to absorb and the sauce to thicken up. I used 21-26 count raw shrimp that I did shell just because I didn't want to shell after cooking. I imagine the flavor would have been even better had I left them on. Will have a loaf of French bread for next time to get every drop of sauce. I am definitely going to hunt down the Pimenta and try it with cod too!!! Thanks so much for a great recipe!!!",
