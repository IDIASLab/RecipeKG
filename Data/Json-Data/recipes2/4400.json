I also did as one of the other reviews had suggested.  After I cooked all the chicken I added about 1 tsp. of butter into the non-stick fry pan to which I added 1 tsp. flour.  Once incorporated I added about \u00bc cup milk, cappers, 1 tbsp. capper juice and 1 tsp. lemon juice.  Mixed and allowed to simmer for a couple of minutes.   Family loved it thanks Lisawas for this recipe.  Will be doing again.",
