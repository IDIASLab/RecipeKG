It is strongly flavored and has a very low smoking point. Most Asian recipes use it as a flavoring ingredient not a frying medium. I used peanut oil to brown the chicken tenders after seasoning them with salt pepper and Asian pepper spice. After browning I removed them from the pan to prevent over-cooking. The sauce was way too thick and I thought the flavor rather one dimentional so I added one tsp sesame oil ginger garlic soy sauce rice vinegar 5-spice powder and a little water to thin it. I heated the sauce in the skillet and when it was hot put the chicken tenders back in. They were okay but not very Thai IMO. There are better recipes on this site. Sorry.",

Otherwise 1) As others recommend use a sauce pan to mix the sauce. That makes certain the ingredients are mixed well and will keep it from clumping 2) I used peanut butter with nuts which tasted great and is not unusual for Asian cooking 3) I used a lot of water in the sauce (didn't measure but at least a cup) to thicken up the sauce. I thought it was way too thick as written. The water did not dilute the flavor at all 4) I only had 1 tablespoon of sesame oil left so I mixed it with peanut oil and it was a good choice. This recipe is so easy that I can imagine throwing it together for a snack or \"different than the same ol'\" quick lunch quite often. Strong but good flavor if you like the main ingredients.",

For the sauce, we added all ingredients to a bowl and mixed them, adding about a quarter cup of leftover coconut milk and some water(per the other reviews), and several shakes of curry powder. I poured the sauce over the chicken and veggies when they were done, cooking only another couple minutes. The juices from the vegetables and chicken thinned the sauce the rest of the way and it was the perfect consistency. Very tasty. We got four substantial meals from one large chicken breast and two cups cooked rice. Probably also reduced the calories a little that way. Thanks for the easy recipe!",
