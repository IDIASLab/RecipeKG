The texture and taste is just like the homemade corn tortillas I get from a small local Mexican restaurant where the mother makes these daily. The texture is soft almost near wanting to melt in your mouth good while holding your taco fillings without crumbling apart. I had a few leftover and they reheated nicely for a few seconds in the microwave the next day without drying out. A tortilla press makes these easier to make (just lightly press) but does take some practice...at least for me in removing the tortilla from the plastic without tearing them but my husband had no problem doing so. Definitely will continue to make these tortillas! Thanks for the recipe!",
