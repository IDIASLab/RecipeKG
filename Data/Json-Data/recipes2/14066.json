It got rave reviews when I took it to my BBQ and DH is asking for it again. He said it is better than my old pasta salad that was so much more work! I used a combination of creamy italian and a zesty italian vinegarette. More creamy italian than vinagerette. I used about 3/4 bottle combined. About 7 oz of creamy and 4 oz of the vinegarette. I added about a cup of artichoke hearts 1/2 a bottle of vlassic zesty pepper rings and a 6oz bag of sliced sun-dried tomatoes. I left out the broccoli and the pepperoni. I chilled it over-night and it was even better the next day. This one is a keeper!",

I made a mistake with the first packet and added 1/2 cup of water instead of oil. I left it at that and added the oil then another packet following the box directions exactly.  The added water made a milder flavoring so I'm going to keep it that way for the next time I make it.\nI used half a box of shells, cut up red pepper, 1/4 of a vidalia onion, broccoli, cherry tomatoes and Hormel pepperoni. For half a box of pasta the 2 packets of seasonings made the salad just right, not dry and not swimming in dressing.\nFor something different, I now use a box of spiral pasta and half a bag of cooked and cooled cheese ravioli.",

I used hard salami instead of pepperoni and about 1/2 a bottle of Olive Garden italian dressing. I used bowtie pasta and added diced cucumbers red onion green olives and cherry tomatoes. I substituted shredded parmesan for the shredded mozzarella. Very good right away and I'm sure it will improve with some time in the fridge. Thanks for a great recipe.",
