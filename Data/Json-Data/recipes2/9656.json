I did not try it myself but they ate over half for dessert last night and they said it was delicious.",

Makes it pretty stawberrylicious.  I've had several people tell me this was their favorite pie ever.  Thank you for this recipe!\n\nOriginal:  Pretty tasty and very easy to make!  We added about a cup of strawberry and I might add more next time.  We also did not find it necessary to use an entire 8oz cool whip to frost the top.  We just used some to decorate.  I'd be afraid using the whole second tub of cool whip would make it basically a cool whip pie, not a strawberry pie.  It did taste just like a strawberry shake!",
