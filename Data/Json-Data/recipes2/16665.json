I made my own for this; my recipe produced about a cup of pesto and I ended up using it all; 1/2c didn't seem like enough.  I'm not used to using crushed red pepper flakes so wasn't certain how much to add; did about 1/4 tsp and it was just right; might do slightly more next time.  Sprinkled parmesan and toasted pine nuts on top of each serving.  YUMMO!  Thanks so much, Kristin! (My pesto recipe: 1/2c evoo, 1c fresh basil leaves, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 garlic cloves, 1/2c toasted pine nuts, 1/2c parmesan; blend all together in blender or food processor.)",

I made a few modifications - I used 16 dry-packed sun-dried tomatoes instead of oil-packed (soaked them in boiling water for 3-5 minutes and then coarsely chopped) and added a handful of toasted pine nuts (omitted red pepper flakes though). Very easy and tasty.  I used half of a 270mL basil Classico pesto, if that helps anyone. :)",

As others I made a few changes - I used the oil from the sundried tomatoes and I know I used more than 1 teaspoon more like a couple of tablespoons - next time I think I will saute in some chicken broth to cut the fat. I also added some slice crimini mushrooms some sliced roasted red peppers more sundried tomatoes and a sprinkle of parmesan. After the chicken and mushrooms were cooked I tossed in the sundried tomatoes and red peppers then tossed in the cooked whole wheat rotini pasta and the pesto while keeping the pan on low. Tossing in a bowl would have been nicer presentation but it was just the two of us so I had one less bowl to wash. I have never been a pesto fan but I liked this. It was not the best as in 5 stars but real close It was relatively quick and easy to make and I will definitely make it again.",
