It tastes just like the appetizer I order at one of my favorite Italian restaurants in New York. It has a soupy consistency so best served in a bowl with a crusty bread for dipping. My husband asks me to make this every week. I promise you will love this recipe. The cooking technique removes the bitterness from the escarole while maintaining the firmness of the beans.",

But my husband likes escarole (he orders it every time we go to dinner at a local Italian restaurant) so the other day when escarole was on sale for 0.79 per pound and a bag of spinach was selling for 2.99 I thought I'd give him a thrill. I par-cooked 3 boneless pork chops (instead of the bacon) in a little bit of butter and a splash of olive oil added a handful of baby carrots and a T. of granulated sugar to my pot and cooked everything together for 45 minutes. My husband loved it and promised that if I would make this for him at least \"sometimes\" he'd never ever again spend 6.95 for a bowl of escarole soup (sounds like a plan). As for me? I still don't like escarole but prepared this way I had to begrudgingly admit that it was at least \"quite edible\".",
