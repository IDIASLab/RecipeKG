The first time I cubed the cheese, the second time I shredded - both came out equally delicious.  I also added some parm cheese to the panko topping - it browned nicely in the oven and gave it that little bit of extra flavor.  I used a mix of 1/2 & 1/2 and whole milk in place of soy milk the 1st time, all skim milk the second time, and again, both were delicious (obviously the first was more rich).  If you're trying to save a few calories, I forgot the melted butter the 2nd time and nobody noticed.  Thanks so much for a wonderful mac & cheese recipe!",
