I normally don't like honey-based sauces, but this wasn't overpoweringly sweet. It was a nice balance between sweet and smokey. I used a local Asian BBQ rub in place of the mesquite seasoning since they were pretty comparable and it turned out fine. Also, I used sea salt in place of seasoned salt. Careful with over-baking; 15 minutes might be too long depending on thickness. 11 minutes was more than enough for my fillets.",
