Fortunately I was able to find the recipe here at All Recipes. Thanks Marilyn! I made it without cream cheese and it turned out great. I used white marshmallows and poured a little of the cherry juice in to make it pink. My husband loves it with pecans. It is very quick and easy to put togther but it has to freeze for many hours--so plan ahead.",

My mother served it every Christmas when I was a child and the recipe was lost along with her until I found it here. I suggest only a few changes. I add about teaspoon of almond extract and I use sliced almonds instead of pecans. Also I use the WHITE rather than the pastel mix of mini-marshmallows. I freeze the mixture in muffin tins. It s so easy to pop out individual servings onto a salad plate with lettuce leaf or two garnish with a dollop of mayo topped with a cherry. Very pretty and delicious. Best of all you can/must make ahead relieves some of the last minute pressure.",
