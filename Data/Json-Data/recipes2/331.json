The sandwich isn't terrible, but like he said, there are more satisfying steak and mushroom recipes out there. This just wasn't worth the price of the ribeye steaks for me. \n\nIf you're still inclined to make this, I ended up cooking the steaks first, then deglazing the pan with brandy, and then adding the mushrooms to save myself the hassle of cooking down a pan sauce and washing an extra pan. I seasoned the mushroom/shallot mixture with a bit of rosemary and thyme in the last couple minutes of cooking. I also subbed goat cheese for the pate, which I thought was good.",
