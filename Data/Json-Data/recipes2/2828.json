I served this with wilted garlic spinach and a fresh salad on the side. Remember that tofu is a concentrated protein, so you don't need as much tofu as you would meat. This dish is great reheated! If you want to be really creative, try grilling your tofu for an even more delicious result!",

This marinade is wonderful, and flavorful but could really benefit from the addition of minced garlic and maybe some sesame oil; I sprinkled mine w/ toasted sesame seeds and green onion.
