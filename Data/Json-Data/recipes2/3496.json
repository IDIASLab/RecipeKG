I made 3 servings, because I didn't see the point of chopping and mixing all of the ingredients and heating up the oven, for 1 serving! I followed the recipe exactly even making a guacamole and chopping up the red peppers, except using Trader Joes homemade style white tortillas. The problem I had, was when I flipped them the beans wanted to fall out and when I went to eat one the toppings wanted to do the same thing. I used a homemade restaurant style salsa. I can only assume it was too thin for this. I think a thick jarred or chunky style salsa is meant for this recipe possibly. Although, it would increase the lower fat content, more cheese would definitely hold these together and make them less saucy too.",
