It still tastes great reheated the next day. One piece of advice- don't use fat free cream cheese, the texture didn't turn out right when I used it.  Also, I noticed that the people who were complaining about the dish being too runny were also the ones who omitted the french-fried onions.  These absorb a lot of liquid, so if you don't like onions, you will need to subsitute something in their place.",
