I very rarely make a recipe without tweaking it in some way so I hope no offense to Castoways who posted the original recipe. For starters I doubled the recipe. With that in mind I added in 2 tablespoons of dried onions a teaspoon of garlic powder fresh ground pepper and roughly 4 teaspoons Worchestershire sauce maybe more. The worchestershire sauce really completed this recipe. It added that little extra something that I thought it needed. I made 2 logs and then rolled them in toasted pecans. This made a delicious cheese spread and is exactly what I was looking for. My family will go nuts over it. I'll be using this recipe again. Thank you so much!",
