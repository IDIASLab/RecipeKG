I had some extra filling (3/4 cup) that I justed baked in a small casserole. It held fine. I really liked the flaky taste of the crust the day I baked the tart but the next day I really couldn't taste the crust. I would probably leave the crust out unless making it for company. Save some calories and some. Definitely not an inexpensive dish!",

It was well-received and made good leftovers too. In the interest of time I used a frozen deep-dish pie shell (Pet-Ritz) and I found that I had about 1/2 to 3/4c. too much filling after filling the shell to the brim. Although the recipe is vague the only leek soup mix packets I could find in the supermarket were by Knorr so that is what I used.",
