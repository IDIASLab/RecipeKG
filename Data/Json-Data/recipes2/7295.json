Using what I had, in the processor went the shrimp, 2 T fine dry bread crumbs, 1 egg white,  2 tsp garlic paste, 1 T cilantro paste, 1/2 t tumeric, 1 t sriracha, 1/2 t cayenne and pinch K salt. I wanted shrimp pieces , so processed just enough so the patties would hold together with visible chunks. Chilled 3 hours and using a tablespoon measure, made rounded measures, 12 in total. I flattened to 1/2\" thick, dredged well in the panko, and fried 2 min first side, 1 1/2 min second side. Panko crumbs make them so deliciously crunchy, and they were moist and juicy inside. The 2 T bread  crumbs blended in well and not noticeable, and kept the chunky mixture together. I'll make again, and will try with scallops, too.  Very delicious, thanks Chef John!",
