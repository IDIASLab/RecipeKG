So I invented this concoction to avoid the tragedy of having to throw out rotten, wasted berries! Perfect for large gatherings, picnics (bring wet-naps/wipes, trust me) or appetizer-type parties!  Very simple to make!  Everyone loved it the first time I made it. You can also substitute blackberries, banana slices, or an appropriate fruit of your choice. Careful with the blueberries though, they may stain!",
