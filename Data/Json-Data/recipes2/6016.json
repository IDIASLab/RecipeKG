If I make this again, I would use a smaller noodle, and let the tomatoes and chick peas simmer longer b/c our chick peas stayed more like pebbles than we'd have liked for the mere handful of minutes that it simmered in the instructions.",

I also added the red chilli flakes early on lots of black pepper a few shakes of dried onion Italian herbs and Chef's Shake. I mashed up some of the chickpeas to make it more of a sauce then I served it with toasted bread crumbs (be careful they burn easily!) and shredded parmesan on top. I made farfalle pasta instead of linguine or spaghetti. Everyone loved it! Fast and easy & tasty. The extra spices and wine elevated this from a 3 to a 4.",

One reviewer said it was hard to keep twirled pasta and the goodies on a fork, so after the pasta cooked and before I added to the goodies, I used scissors to cut it into 2-3 inch pieces and it worked perfectly! I did add a little pasta water a splash of wine, and about 1 extra Tbs of olive oil to moisten it a bit.  This is definitely added to my recipe rotation!",
