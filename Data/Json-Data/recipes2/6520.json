So I'm always trying to find some new vessel for the delicious sausage. This was far better than I had dared hope it would be. It seemed such a weird combination but it definitely works! I'm just not sure that adding the crushed tortillas had much effect. Maybe I made them too small to give the quesadilla any crunch....",
