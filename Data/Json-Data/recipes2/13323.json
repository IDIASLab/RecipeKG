Don't leave out the lime juice because it adds a great flavor to the broth.\n\nI'm not sure if it was a mistake in the recipe, but I only used 2 cans of chicken broth (4 cups) b/c it was all I had on hand. It seemed like the right amount of liquid to me. So I'm wondering if the 2 quarts of chicken broth may have been in error?  1 quart would have been plenty.\n\nThe sweetness of the squash and the texture were just so good!  My kids ate it up and requested that I make just plain squash the next day.\n\nThis recipe is a keeper for me!",

I used one chipotle pepper as I had a half can of extra hot rotel to use up.  Next time I will use all chipotle peppers for heat, as I missed out on the smokiness two peppers would have given it.  I added a can of pinto beans, as I like a more stew like soup.  I used cilantro instead of parsley, dried basil, and veg, broth and water instead of chicken broth to make it vegetarian.  My squash was already cooked, so I added it with the beans and liquids after sauteing the onion, carrot, and celery.  I added some leftover roasted red pepper leftover from pizza night, but I don't think it was enough to change the flavor any. I think it would be fun to add something green like kale to give it more color. I also think almost any leftover meat could be added (though what do I know, I haven't eaten the stuff in 15 years).",

I'm always looking for healthy and/or vegetarian soups.  This one fits the bill of healthy, so it was a great one to try.  I used the whole squash (probably about 3 cups or so) and a large Vidalia onion.  I also had to sub a few ingredients (used adobo seasoning instead of the separate spices, black and pinto beans--3 cans because I like it nice and thick like a stew--and fire-roasted crushed tomatoes instead of diced).  Served with the accompaniments called for as well as chopped avocadoes.  To the reviewer who used 2 CANS of chipotle (and to anyone making this in the future!), please note that the recipe calls for 2 CANNED chipotle peppers rather than 2 whole cans!  2 peppers add a nice note of heat but not too much.  Oh, and I didn't bother to seed the peppers.  ",
