I came up with two large ravioli stuffed with flaked cooked salmon, eggplant, spinach, and mixed cheeses. On the side: roasted cherry tomatoes, Parmesan- and garlic-breaded cauliflower, and shredded zucchini. Mmmmm! We both loved it!  (Flavored pasta dough is recommended. You can use frozen cauliflower florets; thaw at room temperature before proceeding with the recipe.)",
