I put 1/2 cup coconut in for 30 seconds at a time at half power stirring each time until I was happy with it. I had a 7 oz bag of sweetened coconut flakes so I used the rest in the batter and the frosting. Since I was adding additional coconut I halved the amount of extract in the frosting and added 1/2 tsp of vanilla.",

Highly recommended but I would make some slight changes.",
