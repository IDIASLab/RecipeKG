I read all of the reviews saying it was missing something, so I went on a quest to find it.\nFirst of all, I saute'd the chicken in hot sesame oil, but regular sesame oil would probably be nice also. This added a nice kick and flavor.\n\nI added lots of carrots, cubed potatoes (a must), onions. Then I threw in a can of bean sprouts and a generous handfull of unsalted peanuts (yum!), but you could easily use cashews.\n\nI used a regular can of coconut milk, cilantro, 1 T fish sauce, about 1/3 t of corriander, 1-2 t sugar, and some s and p to taste.\n\nHere is the secret ingredient: a couple of dollops of creamy peanut butter! It gives it a beautiful satay flavor, and somehow balances out the spicy with a more smooth, peanuty taste.\n\nI would love to hear feedback on some of you who try this added ingredient.\n\nMade this way, I will certainly make again, over and over. My husband adored this!\n\nI served over asian coconut rice from this site (something else that balances out the spicyness).\n\nDelicious.",

You might want to start less if you are sensitve to spicy foods.  I recommend that you stir curry paste and 2 Tablespoons corn starch with a little bit of the coconut milk in separate dish, add to cooking vegetables and chicken, then combine the rest of the can of coconut milk at the end to make it easier to stir in a wok.  I followed the suggestions in other reviews and added juice of 1 lime, fresh garlic, 1 tablespoon fish sauce, plus added minced/grated ginger, and plenty of black pepper and salt.  I cooked the minced garlic in the oil for 1 minute before adding the chicken.  Extra cilantro helps the flavor, too.  It was fabulous with rice! A++",

Here is a summary of what I've done:  (1) Use sesame oil instead of olive oil.  Saute grated ginger and fresh pressed garlic in it before adding the chicken.  (2) To make it easier to mix with the chicken/veggies, combine in a small bowl the cornstarch, some regular coconut milk, curry paste, 1/3 t coriander, 2 t peanut butter, 2 T fish sauce, fresh ground pepper, and 3 t sugar.  (3) You might need to add more sugar...initially we did 2 t and realized that it was missing SOMETHING.  Turns out an extra touch of sugar is exactly what was needed.  (4) Adding water chestnuts and chopped cashews give a nice crunch.  (5) Use basil instead of cilantro.",

What was good though even though it wasn't all that spicy someone who does not like it all spicy and burning will enjoy it. Wife says this one is a keeper and I agree with her.
