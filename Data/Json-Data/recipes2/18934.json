Flavorful and easy, this steak is tough to beat. I serve this with brown-and-serve sourdough bread or rolls. If you're really hungry, crumble some additional bacon and add a baked potato. Add candles and a bottle of full bodied red wine (like a cabernet from the Alexander Valley) for a romantic evening.",

It was too cold to grill so I ended up cooking the steaks in the same pan with the onions and just piled them up on top. The blue cheese gave this recipe a nice touch of flair. As we were eating dinner my husband said \"The website called this dish 'Men Love this Steak.' Well they were right.\" Mission accomplished.",

Instead of steak seasoning, I just rubbed in some salt, pepper, garlic, and basil into the steaks. I knew the sauce was going to have a strong flavor and I didn't want the steak seasoning to compete. Due to the freezing temps outside, I cooked the steaks inside in the bacon fat leftover from the frying. When the steaks were done, I removed them (kept them warm in the oven) and saut\u00e9ed some onions (don't like mushrooms) in the bacon fat/steak juices. I proceeded to make the sauce as specified. Though I forgot to add the butter, the sauce didn't seem to miss it.\nThis recipe is a definite keeper.\n",
