Then I realized my Waring Pro&reg; blender at home was already fully capable of the same smoothie greatness, so I got inspired to cram more nutrients into my life by blending them up. The resulting mixture is happy and bright green, but it tastes more like bananas and peanut butter. I can't taste the spinach (though I love it). If it's too thick, use more milk or/and less yogurt and peanut butter. Feel free to substitute nuts for your favorites.",

I used vanilla yogurt. The thing I would do differently next time is use a frozen banana. This was just not cold enough for me, and I think freezing the banana would help with the overall texture of the smoothie.
