To be honest I used a variety of herbs because that's what I had in the pantry(Italian mix-rosemary thyme oregano) plus garlic salt paprika pepper and a dousing of worcestishire like another reviwer sugested. It came out perfectly and the herb mixture couting the outside was heavenly. I used the same mixture on some new potatos and roasted them while the roast rested...a perfect and easy meal.
