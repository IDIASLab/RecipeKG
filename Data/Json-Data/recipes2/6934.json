The one thing I didn't care for was that the egg and breadcrumb made these more like meatloaf instead of hamburgers. I did grill them because that is how we like our burgers and I made them into sliders as mentioned in the cook's notes. If you like meatloaf then you will love these. For me I may try to attempt them without the egg and breadcrumb next time but that is just a personal preference.",
