GREAT RECIPE; GOOD STUFF FROM JOHNSONVILLE!  Johnsonville has \"cornered the marketplace\" when it comes to Brats, Italian Sausage and anything Wisconsin! Thank you!\n\n\"I'm from Wisconsin and have been tailgating for 40 years in Madison and Green Bay. I have to tell you that if you are going to have a Wisconsin Brat, you better grill them first and have your hot marinade ready to receive them off the grill. Once off the grill, allow them to set for at least an hour in the marinade before serving. I usually make brats for a \"crowd\" the day before and allow the brats to sit overnight in the marinade. An hour or so before the tail gate I simply take my \"huge\" Bucky Pot full of brats and marinade and place it right on the grill for the \"re heat\". The brats are flavorful and melt in you mouth... oh, don't forget, use a slotted spoon to take out the sliced onions and garlic from the marinade to put on the brats.. OUT OF THIS WORLD. This is a good recipe for rainy days but, I agree with another reviewer, the flavor of the brat is lost to some degree in this recipe. You must also use a \"strong\" full bodied dark beer. I would use Augsburger Bock beer if it were still made out of Monroe, Wisconsin... ahhhh those good old fall days with a blue sky, cool breeze, the scent of fall leaves and grills, a cold beer, the laughter of friends and a good old fash",

Didn't change any recipe ingredients or measurements but did marinate the sausages in half the beer before grilling them. Then popped them  in the beer, onion and butter bath that had been in the oven at 400 degrees. After 7 minutes cranked up the broil/grill element in the oven and grilled for 3 minutes... Quick, easy, yummy and disappeared in a jiffy! No time to take a photo of this dish. We all devoured it, raving about the delicious taste.   Will definitely make again!",

Some of the grease leaks out so a bit healthier and the beer/onion favor makes up for any loss of juiciness.",
