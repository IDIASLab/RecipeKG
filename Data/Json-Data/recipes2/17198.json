I used Paul Newman's italian dressing fresh sliced Baby Bella mushrooms instead of canned black olives instead of green (that's what I had on hand) and I used DC Girly Girl's salad seasoning (which is also on this site) in this recipe instead of a store-bought brand. We thought this was very good quite kicky. I think if I'd used a packaged salad seasoning it might have been too salty. As it was it was just right. Making my own salad seasoning made me able to control the salt. Next time I'd like to add more vegetables like chopped tomatoes red pepper and maybe zucchini. The longer it sits the better it gets.",
