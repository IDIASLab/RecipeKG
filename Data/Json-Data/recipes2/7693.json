I used 3 cloves fresh garlic instead of jarred. I doubled the Spanish olives and the peas. And I cooked the peas with the rice instead of adding them raw on top at the end! The chicken was so tender and juicy with lots of flavor from the adobo and flavored yellow rice! I will definitely be making this more often!",

                "reviewBody": "Very good easy and versatile. Didn't have adobe seasoning so I seasoned chicken with garlic and onion powder cumin paprika salt and black pepper. I also added a 14 oz can of stewed tomatoes that I diced up. Rather than only green peppers I used some frozen mixed peppers (red yellow and green) that I diced up. Instead of both pimentos and stuffed green olives I just used the stuffed olives since they already had pimentos in them. However I sliced them into thirds and cooked them in the pot with everything else instead of just placing them on top of the finished dish. Same goes for the frozen peas I cooked them along with everything else too. As for the chicken I used a couple boneless skinless breasts. After seasoning them I cut them into small cubes then quickly sauteed them prior to adding them into the pot with everything.. I diced half a yellow onion and sauteed it with the peppers before adding the chicken. For the rice I used another brand of yellow saffron rice since our local store does not carry the Goya brand and I used chicken broth rather than water. Once everything was almost completely finished cooking I added a couple table spoons of sherry and the bit of juice that was left over from the can of stewed tomatoes and I folded that into the entire mixture. basically just to give it some additional flavor. All in all it came out great and the entire family loved it had seconds and there wasn't a single grain of rice left!",

I used red pepper strips since I didn't have pimentos and I opened a can of green chili peppers to go on top and it was amazing! And my picky son ate a serving and a half! My mother who I do a lot of cooking for LOVED it!! She couldn't stop bragging! This will certainly be made again. Oh I also call the the Ricky Ricardo dish since I can't say Arroz Con Pollo. LOL.
