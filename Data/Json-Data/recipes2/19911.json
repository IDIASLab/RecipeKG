Then baked - I don't know how long - I wanted the top crisp so the last 5 minutes I turned the oven up to 375. They were SO DELICIOUS !!!  If you try these don't forget to add the green onions (or Chives) because it made a BIG difference.(Also 1 Pkg of cream cheese is plenty) These are Super Yummy !!!",

I also used a little more than a pinch of garlic.  Definately a keeper.  Thanks for the great recipe Janet",

The only change I would make is to mix the cheddar cheese in before putting it in the oven instead of layering it on top. The cheese sticks together when you layer it on top and you end up eating big globs of cheese instead of having the cheese mix in with the casserole.",

I also added a little milk to help with creaminess. I also used a different type of cheese blend on the top and this worked great as well!
