I used a tall glass filled with ice (a bit more raspberry vodka...) and \"Simply Lemonade\". Lightly stir garnish with a slice of lemon throw in a few raspberries then add a straw if you like. In no time at all your tastebuds will be in for a treat! This is definitely something you won't be able to keep to yourself but want to share with friends. Heck you may want to scale it up and make a pitcher of this for your next BBQ - it's that good and that simple to make. Thanks for a great recipe K-Dub!",

PERFECT!:) This was pretty good very light and refreshing. Since I am the only \"fruit lover\" (my fiance is a confirmed fruit hater!) I made this for myself. While grocery shopping today I saw that Smirnoff vodka was on sale so I picked some up for the sole purpose of making this (I've been eyeing this drink recipe for a while...). When I got home I realized that I had only a shot's worth of Minute Maid lemonade left (darn!) but I did have Crystal Light \"on the go\" lemonade packets in the pantry so I made an 8 oz. glass and decreased the booz accordingly. I could only taste the Crystal Light!!! My fiance \"tried\" a sip and all he could taste was the raspberry flavor (go figure!). I guess time will tell how potent my drink really was:) I WILL try this again (after all I bought an entire bottle of Smirnoff vodka... lol) but with REAL lemonade hoping for the best!
