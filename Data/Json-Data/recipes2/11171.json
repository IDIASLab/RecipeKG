As the first reviewer, I so wanted to give this a rousing good start, but there is just too much preparation here for such a mediocre result. I've never had chayote before - never heard of it either.  I noticed it in the grocery store, deliberately brought some home and sought out a recipe. This stuff is all water, first of all.  I'm not sure boiling it was the best method. The \"shell\" is so soft and tender it was difficult to keep intact to stuff.  The pulp, which is more water than actual substance, is a pain to sop up and by the time I was done there wasn't enough pulp left to stuff all the squash shells.  The quarter cup of cream called for wasn't worth opening up a carton for so I didn't use it and it wasn't missed - remember, this stuff is watery. Most important, this squash has zero flavor. None.  It's just tasteless and watery, so it needs strong seasoning and this recipe just doesn't support that. Labor intensive and fairly flavorless.",

There are a couple of things one can do to make it better with spices---and whipping. But for the effort-make twice baked potatoes instead. It won't be any more calories and better flavor. (Just an aside-I enjoy Chayote particularly fresh or lightly stirfried and it has a marvelous taste all its own.)",

I only had one, so I used less butter, but still used one egg.  I did not have heavy cream and forgot the parmesan.  I boiled, then simmered the squash halves for 20 minutes and they seemed tender enough.  I scooped out the pulp,  left it in 1/2 tsp sized chunks, did not squeeze out the liquid, and salted and peppered it \"to taste\" as I do everything whether the recipe calls for it or not.  I placed the halves in a mini loaf baking dish (they barely fit and were a little pushed together), filled them with the mixings, added more cheddar cheese and then the bread crumbs.  I baked them on 375 for 20 minutes and then kept checking until the egg had set.  I will definitely make this again.  SO tasty!  Thank you Dom's Kitchen!",
