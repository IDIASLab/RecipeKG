When searching for a recipe (including this site) I unfortunately could not find the perfect solution. There were so many different variations with either too many ingredients or missing things we love most. I'm a busy Mom and want EASY so I decided to wing it and came up with my own version.

I cooked mine beforehand as instructed and they came out with the yolks nearly fully cooked and I like mine runny. To each their own though! Also, I just bought some fancy-ish salsa from Walmart and spooned it one the tostadas after they were done baking. Still good! Another thing, I actually just bought corn tortillas instead of tostadas and put a little butter on the bottom of them then baked them. All of the tostadas at Walmart looked like they were already broken but with this method they still came out flavorful and crunchy!",
