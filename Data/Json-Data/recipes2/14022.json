                "reviewBody": "This is delicious and super-easy.  I have made 2 double batches in the past week for people at my school, it went like hotcakes.  Several people asked for the recipe.  I used french vanilla pudding mix, one extra-creamy CoolWhip and one Vanilla CoolWhip, 8 oz. regular sour cream and 8 oz. light sour cream.  I used about 1/2 cup less milk than the full quart needed so the pudding would not be soupy.  I also used Pepperidge Farm Mini-Chessmen cookies in place of the vanilla wafers.  I highly recommend using Chessmen cookies, either regular size or minis, anytime you make banana pudding.  They really class up the taste.  That said, if you are only making a single batch, I would use the regular sour cream instead of the light, since light sour cream has a much softer texture and probably would make a 'soupier' pudding.  All in all, a wonderful pudding recipe and really quick and easy!  Thanks for the posting!",

I used 2 small 3.4 oz. boxes of vanilla pudding instead of one larger one. Stayed with the same amounts of milk sour cream and cool whip. It was a little thicker but I actually liked the neat servings out of the bowl being less sloppy than your usual puddings. My mistake: I whisked the pudding sour cream cool whip and milk but discovered that some of the pudding mix was on the bottom and didn't get mixed in until I was pouring the last layer. I mixed it in as best I could but had a bit of a lumpy super thick last layer. No one noticed though as they were too busy gobbling it up. Even if you don't use this recipe I highly recommend using any recipe calling for the vanilla pudding in the banana pudding dish and NOT banana pudding mixes. Banana pudding mix has sort of an artificial banana flavor but the real bananas and the vanilla pudding make it perfect.",
