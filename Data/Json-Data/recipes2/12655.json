        "description": "Once again zucchini (courgette) to the rescue, providing a really good alternative to standard carb and gluten-heavy pasta. The prep work for these isn't as bad as it looks and they make surprisingly tasty parcels, which you can fill with basically whatever you like. Ricotta and spinach would make a quick and tasty vegetarian alternative. Adding these spices to the beef brings out a lot of Greek-style flavors which complements the feta perfectly, and if you have any left over, you can easily add a bit more tomato sauce and veg to it the next day for a quick chili. Serve immediately on its own or with a side salad. Bon appetit!",

I have used shredded pork, shredded chicken and ground beef. Varied my spices and cheeses. I have also used jarred spaghetti sauce.  Friends have loved it and requested the recipe. When I am at the grocery store and I see zucchini large enough to use I adjust my weekly menu to include these. Thank you for sharing the recipe!!!",
