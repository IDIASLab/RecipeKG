A little canola oil to fry is just fine as it is low in fat and is actually good for you. Scrapple is a great addition to breakfast when fried till crisp but you need a good scrapple to start with. A good recipe is here but do not use MILK USE WATER WITH A PINCH OF BEEF OR CHICKEN BULLION IN THE CORN MEAL.",
