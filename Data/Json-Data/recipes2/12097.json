They are easy and quick to make, and I like them with just a bit of butter for topping. This is a great creative healthy recipe. I will say that the serving size is ridiculously small--I eat one whole recipe, which makes 6 small dollar size pancakes--myself. I also use a whole small banana instead of half, so I won't have half a banana sitting around left over. You can cook these with just cooking spray in the pan, which should lower the fat content",

I used a gluten free flour and I forgot to add xanthum gum so mine were quick to fall apart. I found that keeping them small and cooking them on low heat was the secret to getting them to cook right. The batter was a bit thicker than I prefer. Taste wise they were pretty good but not fab. I tried these because I had some pumpkin that I needed to use up. But I like the Deliciously Healthy Paleo Pancakes With Banana and Walnuts recipe better than this one which is a similar-type recipe. (As an aside I thought paleo meant no grains? Even if you substitute some almond flour I don't think you can call it paleo since its still got regular flour? Maybe I'm wrong?)",
