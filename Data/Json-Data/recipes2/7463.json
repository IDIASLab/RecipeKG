My strawberries were very ripe I think too ripe for this recipe-they were extremely sweet after baking too sweet for the bacon. If I were to make it again I would use medium-ripe strawberries and cook the bacon to a flexible state then stuff each strawberry with a partially cooked piece of bacon to avoid overcooking the strawberries. Then I would proceed with grilling or baking the strawberries. This was a fun project on a rainy afternoon while I baked bacon for the freezer. I used a small paring knife to make a hole completely through the strawberries but a straw would work great if one was available.",

I used about 9 strips of bacon for 25 strawberries but next time I would use more. Also finished the strawberries with melted chocolate. Because of limited grill space I cooked these at a low temperature on a grate. Next time I would go with a higher heat to get some grill marks and take off before the strawberries get soft.",
