They were easy to make and you can prepare them in advance and store them in the fridge until you are ready to put them in the oven. Instead of processed cheese I used grated cheddar cheese. I also recommend using the precooked bacon as it is easier to crumble. I also sprinkled the final product with parsley to improve the presentation. Great recipe!!",
