I used Frangelico hazelnut liqueur and some agave as hazelnut syrup... I later read in my user manual that alcohol should be added towards the end of the ice cream cycle or it might not set up right... didn't seem to be an issue but since this is my first time how would I know? I didn't have chocolate chips so I manufactured my own melted chocolate: coconut oil cocoa powder and confectioner's sugar. The ice cream tasted like mocha hazelnut flavor not noticeable. The base is great and will be a lot of fun to work with. Thanks Tori I made a double batch!",
