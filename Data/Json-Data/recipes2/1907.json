After marinating I broiled it the 5 mins time and it was very moist! However I couldn't escape the albumin that formed on the side of the salmon. I basted the cooked salmon afterwards with some of the butter I melted down with the juice and then I also topped it off with a dollop of the remaining butter mixture that I had set side and didn't melt down. What can I say - I love butter! I would definitely make this again but will most likely play around with making the salmon skin extra crispy for more texture to this recipe.",

I don't quite get why the recipe calls for making 3T of herbed butter when you're only going to use 2t after the fish is cooked... Anyway I used half the amount of dried herbs in the butter then spread about a teaspoon on the fish before and after broiling. I believe this helped give more flavor.",
