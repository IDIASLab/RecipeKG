I was so glad to have found this recipe since all other frosting/icing recipes called for confectioners sugar which I didn't have at the time. I used it on the Banana Cake II recipe to which I added chocolate chips and it was wonderful! Tips: I used rum extract instead of straight rum. A large wisk makes \"folding in\" very easy. Quick and easy to make. Thanks Cyndi!",
