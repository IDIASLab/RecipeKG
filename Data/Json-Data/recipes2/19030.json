I tried making it again the next day with canned chicken instead of poached/shredded and did not like the results as much. Canned chicken makes the texture too goopy and paste-like and we much preferred the chewy bits of chicken in the original recipe. I did like one thing better though and that was mixing most of the cheese in with the rest of the ingredients and only adding a small sprinkle on top. Otherwise it hardens once it's cool into a waxy layer that makes dipping difficult.",
