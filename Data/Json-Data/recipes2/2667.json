There is, however, one crucial piece of info that would appear to have been inadvertently omitted in the written recipe. Fortunately, it was included in the video. The temperature that the oven must be preheated to is 425 degrees. Other than that omission, everything else is spot-on. If you're unsure how to spatchcock your bird, the video covers that. It's helpful to see a demonstration if you've never done it before. Note that although it's possible to do with a meat cleaver and/or a pair of kitchen shears, I'd strongly recommend that you invest in a pair of poultry shears, which have the heft and blade to cut through chicken bones easily. Save yourself some frustration and get the right tool for the job. This technique is excellent for roasting, as in this recipe, or cooking on the grill. The chicken cooks in a fraction of the time. Actually, you can even cook your Thanksgiving turkey this way. It's fast, easy, moist and tender. As you can see, once you get those  poultry shears, you'll make liberal use of them.",

I've always spatchcocked chicken with a boning knife but I must admit kitchen shears ARE easier. The brick trick worked perfectly though mine was a bit slippery since I placed a sheet of silicone paper between the aluminum foil-wrapped bricks and the chicken (I never cook with/on aluminum). I don't use cast iron anymore (glass cooktop) so I thought I'd use my heavy 14\" stainless saut\u00e9 pan... but it was NOT large enough so I used a shallow enamelled (rectangular) roasting pan lined with more silicone paper and that worked beautifully. If I can find a cast iron pan that is rectangular I would buy it just for this purpose. It was that good! Thanks Chef John!:)",

No one heard of spatchcock chicken before so it was a great conversation piece (plus I love saying spatchcock:) I have made spatchcock chicken before using a different method; both are fantastic. I love using my cast iron skillet however I did not have bricks so I used another cast iron pan as my weight. Definitely watch the video! I decided to add sliced onion & minced garlic to the skillet prior to roasting the chicken in the oven. While the chicken was resting I quickly made a gravy out of the drippings using 1/4 c chicken broth & 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch. Thank you again Chef John!",
