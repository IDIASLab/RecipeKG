I really hate to waste chocolate so I threw them into a batch of chocolate chip cookies along with \"normal\" chocolate chips and told everyone that they were chocolate chip surprise cookies. The kids and neighbors loved the fudgy pocket surprise. So as fudge...NOT but fudgy pocket surprise.......YES!",

For every 3c of chips you need to use 4Tbsp. I made three types last year and the most successful was the eggnog variation. you need to add more liquid after melting to keep it from resetting so hard. for egg nog I used 1 fl oz of rum extract nutmeg to taste. This still comes out more solid than traditional fudge but worked since i had about 20 coworkers i was gifting fudge. And use common sense when microwaving chocolate. if your frozen burrito comes out after two minutes ready to eat perhaps room temp chocolate won't take so long. i usually do burst of about 30 seconds and stir each time.",

I put the chocolate chips and butter (not margarine) in a small microwaveable bowl and cooked on high for only 1 minute stirring at the 30 second interval. No lumps no white spots and not even super stiff. I then put it in a very small foiled-lined square Corning Ware dish until it firmed up. It did have the consistency of fudge and even tasted kinda sorta like fudge. I would never eat this at one sitting though since it has 899 calories!",
