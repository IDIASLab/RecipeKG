The sauce didn't have much flavor, and mine didn't really cook down, so I ended up with an unappealing looking gunk on top of the chicken. I feel like the recipe needs a bit more. The Italian spices on the inside were a nice flavor boost, but not enough. I'm thinking that maybe next time I'll try some of my garden herbs and add some salt to the recipe.",
