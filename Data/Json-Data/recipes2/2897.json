The croutons (I pulsed them in the food processor to rough crumbs) add great flavor and the broccoli (I used fresh and blanched it for just a couple of minutes) stayed a vibrant green. Since my croutons already had sufficient butter in them I didn\u2019t add the second drizzle of butter the recipe called for.  Rich and flavorful, this dressed up broccoli is worth the extra preparation it requires.",

I also couldn't make myself use 1/2C butter (I halved the recipe) so I used a bit less than 1/4C and it was plenty. I may try to use even less next time just to save some calories. We only had seasoned croutons and they added some nice flavor. I used GOYA Adobo Seasoning for the seasoned salt. THANKS for the recipe!",

I couldn't see drowning this healthy vegetable in all that butter so I just dotted the spears with it. Since the recipe name is broccoli with buttery crumbs that is what I used. I seasoned my homemade crumbs with garlic powder and some grated provolone sprinkled that over and dotted that with butter. Then baked as directed. This was delicious the broccoli was tender crisp and we will be having this again. Thanks Jen",

I'm sure using buttery round crackers in place of the croutons would work just as well. Like a veggie comfort food!",
