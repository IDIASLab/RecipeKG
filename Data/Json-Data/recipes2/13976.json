She \"tweaked\" it by using 4 cans of albacore tuna (it was on sale/50% off) rather than 3 and adding 1 Knorr's vegetable boullion cube to the \"potato water\". She added 1/2 stick of butter and 1 T. fresh chives to the potatoes when she \"mashed\" them (with our hand mixer) and tossed the tuna with 1/2 tsp. fresh dill 1 tsp. ReaLemon 1 stalk of celery (chopped fine) 1/2 medium zucchini 2 carrots (she used our \"vegetable peeler\" to give them a \"julienned\" look) and some mushrooms (whatever I had in the refrigerator). Then she \"layered\" it: bottom layer - potatoes with parmesan cheese (all 3 T.); middle layer - the tuna mixture; top level - more of the potato mixture (no parmesan but 3 slices of Mozzarella \"folded\" in). She TOPPED her \"presentation\" with 3 slices of Provolone (a little bit more of a \"kick\" but not overpowering) and baked it for 25-30 minutes. HER recipe made 2 \"presentations\" so she used 4 eggs 3/4 cup of 2% milk and 1 cup of vegetable boullion (for moisture). My Daughter got an \"A\" for her assignment and I've been delegated to making no fewer than 6 of \"her creations\" for a Lenten \"pot luck\" at our Church. In brief: we felt this was a good basic recipe but only with her/our added \"tweaks\" would we give it 5 stars.",
