I have no idea how authentic this is, and have never been to Detroit, or even Flint. I have had Nathan's&reg; version, which I enjoyed, but the word on the street is that it's not nearly as good as the relatives it spawned.",

Good with cheese mustard and onions on top. I followed the directions as instructed but eye balled the seasoning and just added things to taste as I was cooking. The seasoning is flexible but the technique I think is what makes this great. It results in a really nice soft (for lack of a better word) and uniform meat sauce with no big pieces. It might look gross while cooking but it comes together well in the end. I let most of the liquid cook out for a more dry sauce. So good.",
