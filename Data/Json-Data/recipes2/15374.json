Next time we make them (oh yes there will be many more next times for this recipe!) we are going to scale back the recipe first of all because I ran out of wrappers with half the filling left and use less sesame oil and worchestire sauce and add pepper and see how they turn out. I also wonder how these would taste with a little wasabi worked in.... mmm lots of possibilities with this gem of a recipe! I agree with the other reviewers in that you can't put too much filling or they will leak but I found that when they start to leak they are ready to come out of the oil anyway. Thanks so much!:)",
