The only thing different I do is use elbow macaroni add about 1/4 cup minced onion 1 minced garlic or to taste and omit the eggs. For those who find it too soupy bake it covered for the first half hour and remove the cover for the last half hour of baking. Let it rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. This is probably my most shared recipe since I've taken it to lots of carry-ins. Depending on how many I have for dinner I often double the recipe and LOVE the leftovers. My husband hates it warmed up so good - more for me!",
