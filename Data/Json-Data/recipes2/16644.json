Without that though it was actually pretty flavorful but I did a couple of things a little differently from the recipe. Used olive oil instead of butter and only a teaspoon. I also used celery root instead of potatoes. That in itself really makes this an amazing dish. The other thing I did was add about an ounce of a combination of fresh herbs -- thyme oregano and rosemary. This was definitely a dish to make again but leave yourself some time. The other reviewers were right about this taking longer than 25 minutes to make. I baked mine at 400 degrees but it took 55 minutes before it was finished.",
