I just didn\u2019t like the idea of bland potatoes. I used 1 package of bacon for the top once again cause we EXTRA. Next time I think I\u2019ll add mashrooms or chicken maybe both before putting the cheese mixture over it.  Just to make it more filling considering it was my main dish. Over all it was a hit with the family and I have all the ingredients on hand on any given day. Will definitely make this again!",
