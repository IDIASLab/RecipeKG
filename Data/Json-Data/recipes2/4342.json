The only changes I made were upping the 1/3 hash brown potatoes to 2/3 cup (I found 1/3 cup wasn't enough for a good layer) and I used pork sausage as it was half the price of the chicken. I think I will lessen the cook time down to 40 minutes next time as 50 minutes in my oven overcooked it a bit. Thank you for a great recipe!:)",
