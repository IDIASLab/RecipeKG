I didn't have Creole Seasoning, so I threw in a combination of Cajun and Chipotle spices, Ancho Chili Powder, and I brushed some Creole Mustard onto the fish.

I left out the red pepper and half the cayenne to cut down on the spice and I left out the wine since I didn't have any and don't like it anyway. I used lemon instead of lime and dried cilantro rather than fresh because that's what I had. Definitely worthy of making again!
