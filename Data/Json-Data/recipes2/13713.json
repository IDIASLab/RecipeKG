Used Mexican style stewed tomatoes added a few shakes of chili powder s&p garlic & onion powder. I let it simmer and tasted. Needed something so used 1 beef bouillon cube to 1/2 cup water and let it simmer a little bit longer. PERFECT!!! Also I used the spiral noodles (Rotini) in the bottom of the casserole (cooked very aldente) then the chili mix and put plenty of cheese over the top. I baked 10 minutes covered and another 10 uncovered. My family devoured it thank you so much for such a great recipe!",
