The layers of pineapple cream cheese and the use of poppy seed dressing mixed into the chicken (instead of mayo) really added layers of flavor. The only thing that I would do differently the next time is to open the rolls and brown them under the broiler briefly before assembling. Would be very nice for brunch a buffet a reception or a shower. Terrific combination of flavors and they look rather elegant!",

It was hard to get enough meat into each bite to satisfy quickly enough and resulted in a lot of bread consumption which is not what I was looking for in this meal. The flavor was good largely dependent upon the poppyseed dressing so try to find one you know you like or make your own and adjust to taste. My DH took an entire row of rolls and slit it down the side and turned this into some sort of weird submarine sandwich made mostly of Hawaiian bread and I wish I'd gotten a photo of that because I think it would've tickled HotGrandma to see it!
