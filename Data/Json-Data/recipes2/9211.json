My only change to CJ's recipe was replacing one green pepper with some diced cellery.   I didn't taste the final product before packing it up for its trip to a friends house for college football viewing.  The very sad news is that nothing was left in the dish for me to finish at home.

Hubby is not a fan of sweet stuff so I knew I needed to cut back a bit on the brown sugar I also added a splash of cider vinegar and a teaspoon of chili powder and I always add about 1/2 cup of finely diced celery to my sloppy joes. I don't think I am misleading anyone by rating this 5 stars even though I did tweak it a bit to suit my family's taste preference. I'm sure the original recipe tastes great. Thanks again Chef John.",
