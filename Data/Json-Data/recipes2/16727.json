Based on other reviews that I read, I omitted the onion soup mix. First, I made a seasoning mix of black pepper, garlic powder, seasoning salt and cinnamon. I rubbed this into the bone-in pork chops and seared them in olive oil. While they were browning, I mixed one cup applesauce, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 3 tablespoons margarine and 1 chopped red apple (I didn't have green ones on hand). In a 9x13 pan, I poured 2 tablespoons butter mixed with 2 teaspoons minced garlic. I put the browned pork chops in the pan and poured the apple mix on top. I kept the cooking temp and time the same. These chops came out so juicy and tender, the best I have ever had. My guests were not that hungry but ate 'em up anyway!! Don't let the other mediocre reviews stop you from trying this recipe. It's a good base, just modify to your family's taste and you will have a real winner!!",

Melted a couple tbls of butter and one clove minced garlic to bottom of baking pan then placed the browned chops in the pan and topped w/ the apple mixture.
