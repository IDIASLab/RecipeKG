I did find that the chimichangas were huge, so I made a note to use 6 tortillas next time. Then I found Uncle Ben's Ready Rice - Spanish Style (90 seconds in the microwave) and that worked even better. Less clean up, quicker and just as tasty.  I have used different types of salsa - each giving a different taste to the chimis. You can experiment with these.  AND there is enough for left overs! (Makes dinner the next night much easier). Oh - to reheat, I flip them over and bake them in the oven at 350 deg for about 15 minutes until hot inside. Flipping them over (seam side up) keeps the top from getting too brown.",
