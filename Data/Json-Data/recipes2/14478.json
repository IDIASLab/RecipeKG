That sounds like complete overkill and I think the parmesan could be a little much too. After draining the artichokes - USE REGULAR ARTICHOKE HEARTS IN WATER two 14oz cans - I usually run a knife through each can several times to give the hearts a rough chop. I've also started using two cans of chilis (don't bother to drain - that's FLAVOR you're putting down the drain!) and the mayo (usually light - fat free is the work of the devil!:p) is eyeballed but definitely not even half a cup. Start with about a quarter to a third of a cup stir it up and adjust until it's a fairly loose creamy consistency - but not gloppy. I usually use about half a 6oz. tub of shredded parmesan with an extra handful across the top before baking. And don't forget the Wheat Thins - for some reason that is the accompaniment that tastes the best with this! Enjoy the dip - I guarantee you will crave this version time and again!",
