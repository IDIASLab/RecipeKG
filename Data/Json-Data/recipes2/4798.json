Browned my skirt steak to medium and removed. Then made the gravy in the cast iron pan. Made for less washing and likely improved the flavor of the gravy. I only wish My fries had turned out crispier but flavor wise this is pretty high up there with poutine I had around Niagara Falls. Will definitely make this again and it may even be my new skirt marinade!",
