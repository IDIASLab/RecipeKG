We thought it was all right but more than likely won't make it again BECAUSE it was bread with lots of gooey cheese and mayo on it. (I did use mayonnaise rather than \"creamy salad dressing \" i.e. Miracle Whip) Both the black olives and the touch of chili powder were interesting and quite nice additions as was the green onion I used rather than regular onion. Even tho' I used small baguettes rarher than a whole loaf of French bread 10 minutes wasn't quite long enough to get the cheese all melty - I unfortunately found I had to nuke it. Interesting to try but when it comes right down to it this was just a little too rich for our tastes.",
