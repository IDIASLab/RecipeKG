It seemed as if the custard wasn't quite enough for the amount of bread in the casserole, and, I wish I would have gone with my instinct because it was a little dry in the morning and top of the casserole was more like a dry crunchy toast.  It is possible that the size of my french loaves were larger than what the author of the recipe used, but, since it just said (2) french loaves that is what I used. I did top with a homemade blueberry sauce, so, that definitely helped with the dryness.  I would make this again, but, just use less bread or more custard next time.",

If too dry, just add more milk. Its important to make sure the bread is completely covered by the liquid before you place it in the refrigerator.",

I think I'll butter the pan next time the exterior turned out crispy in my nonstick pan.  Oh and I only used enough French bread to fill the bread pan so I had about half a loaf left over.

After reading some of the reviews I increased the number of eggs and I used half and half instead of milk more than what was called for. I used only 1 very large loaf of bread. I scattered extra blueberries over the top of the casserole and I put weights on top of the plastic wrap to ensure that the bread was covered by the liquid. Also I bought some blueberry syrup and poured that over it when serving it. Next time I make it I will remember to spray the dish with non-stick cooking spray. This was over the top delicious and I'm planning to make it again for our Sunday brunch at church on July 31st.",
