This gives the noodles a great flavor.  If anyone is concerned about the oil used, I recommend coconut oil.    I love eggs and bacon as well.  My cholesterol is perfect even for my age.  Cholesterol is not terribly affected by diet because cholestrol issues are inherited.  Check the Harvard study. The body needs fats to absorb certain vitamins and minerals.  Ramen is just like any other noodle, no worse and no better.",
