He was happy when I told him I doubled the recipe. \n\nI simplified the recipe by boiling the chicken in water with celery salt, garlic powder and pepper. Then I cut the chicken in bite size pieces and used the liquid for the broth.\n\nI cooked 16 oz of sausage with the celery, green pepper and onion. After the sausage was done I just added all the ingredients in the skillet and cooked till the rice was done. \n\nSimple, easy and delicious. Thanks Jan for a easy great recipe.",
