I made an altered version of this -- maintaining the grapes walnuts red onion and balsamic vinaigrette. The flavors went well together and I added chopped chicken and some fresh thyme. I left out the other ingredients because I either didn't have them (radishes) or didn't think they were needed (raisins). Ended up quite tasty.",

Omitted the green onion because it already tasted too \"oniony\" and no radishes. The dressing was from another recipe from this site since I didn't have bottled dressing. Anyway really did not like this recipe. We forced ourselves to finish it but my mouth still tastes like onions. I hate wasting grapes and nuts and the time. Maybe it would have been better as part of a spinach salad???",
