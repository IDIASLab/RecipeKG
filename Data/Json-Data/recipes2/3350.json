I had 2 cans of Grand's Jr.'s biscuits so I just went w/ those. I don't keep garlic salt on hand so I used garlic powder and added a quick shake or 2 of salt which worked perfectly and dried chives for the fresh which I mixed into the butter mixture to re-hydrate them. I seriously could've just eaten this as the meal lol that's how good it was...so buttery cheesy garlicky and just all around delicious oh and so simple to make too! I will def be using this recipe often as it has become a new favorite YUM! Thanks Arich01 for sharing this awesome recipe.:)",
