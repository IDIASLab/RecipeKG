I started using the 3cup round Ziploc containers instead of 1pint jars. Recipients of the gift don't feel obliged to give back the container after they've made their soup. You can also fit more than just 1 cup of egg noodles in the container. The adjustment I make when preparing the soup is to replace 12 - 16 ounces of water with turkey broth. Oh and if you don t have a fresh turkey meat try adding a can of chicken. It makes this recipe even simpler.",
