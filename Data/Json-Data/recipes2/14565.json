After reading some of the other reviews I came up with some alterations that turned out just as the recipe I was looking for. Instead of melting the marshmallows in with the chocolate I mixed them in with the cereal. I only used 4 cups marshmallows and 6 cups cereal. This way the chocolate mixture was coating the cereal and marshmallows together. Everyone loved them.",

Then I pour in the additional 2 cups golden Grahams, 1/4 cup chocolate chips and 1/2 cup mini marshmellows. This way the last part of the cereal tastes a bit crunchy as it is not drowned in the chocolate and the marshmellows and chocolate chips do not melt for an added flavor. YUMMY! Always a hit camping!

For those of you who had problems I would recommend melting the chocolate mixture in the microwave. It will turn out much softer and easier to stir into the golden graham cereal. The only reason I can think of why the mixture would harden so fast is that it's being cooked too long or too high. If making on stovetop try using a candy thermometer. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla to melted mixture and then stirred in one cup mini marshmallows after I stirred the chocolate/cereal mixture up a bit.",
