I made it for co-worker's party, and not only was the whole thing eaten, but every single person there asked for the recipe, and even talked about it days later.  A number of the other reviewers mentioned that the mousse/whipped cream concoction was too runny.  That was really my only complaint about this recipe; the mousse was difficult to work with, especially when it came to frosting the outside of the cake.  However, after some experimentation, I found that instant pudding mix, added (dry) to the whipped cream/white chocolate works exceptionally well.  Not only does it stabilize the mousse, but it also adds flavor.  I recommend trying either the vanilla pudding mix or the white chocolate.  Also, to add an extra boost of flavor to the raspberry, try adding a few drops of orange extract.  It enhances the berry flavor quite well.  I also recommend adding sugar to taste.  I agree that the raspberry puree can be rather tart.  However, don't sweeten too much; a hint of tartness offsets the sweetness of the cake and the mousse.  Hope that helps!",

First melt chocolate with some heat cream and whisk till smooth. let cool down. if you don't it will melt the whipped cream which some who rated this recipe obviously did. whip the cream till soft peaks form and add a stabilizer and sugar to sweeten. whipped cream stabilizers are sold in specialty stores or online. piping gel also stabilizes cream to a nice thick consistency. next mix 1/4 of whipped cream into chocolate that has been cooled. next fold in another 1/4 of cream. do slowly so as keep airy and thick. you'll love these tips if used correctly!!!!!!!!!!!",

I also thickened up the raspberries with a little more cornstarch, so it was like a thick jam. The mousse was a little sloppy though, I think maybe if you refrigerate before you ice the rest of the cake it would go on a little smoother, esp. on the sides.  Will definitely make this again.",

I followed the advise of the reviewer who used instant pudding to thicken the mousse. I just whipped my cream until it was thick and sprinkled in about 2 TBS of vanilla instant pudding and it thickened immediately so I didn't add anymore then mixed in the white chocolate it turned out very good easy to frost not runny at all. I didn't have raspberries so I used strawberries and it was very good.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this cake yesterday & put it in the freezer. We're having a big family BBQ in a few days & I wanted something I could make ahead of time. I read other reviews & took the advice to add instant vanilla pudding to the whip cream. I used a 4-serving pkg - make sure it's 'instant' pudding! It firmed up the whip cream SO nicely. I melted the white chocolate with 1/2 cup whip cream - not 1 c. as orginally written & I whipped the remaining 1-1/2 cups with the pudding). I cooled the white choc. completely (over a bowl of ice water & gradually folded the whip cream in. It was a perfect consistency for icing the layers & piping the remaining around the base of the cake & the top. Also when I made the raspberry filling - I didn't bother pureeing the rasberries first. When you heat the berries add sugar (2Tbsp) & the cornstarch/water - the berries break down & puree themselves. This saves time. All in all I found this to be an excellent recipe. You can't go wrong with a cake mix and the white choc. mousse tasted delicious. The raspberry filling was of a jam consistency - I put it between layer 2 and 3 (mousse between 1 & 2 and 3 & 4). The results looked very professional! Can't wait to taste the final product. P.S. I won't add the fresh rasberries that decorate the top of the cake until I take it out of the freezer and the cake has thawed. I encourage you to try this recipe. Make the few changes that have been suggested by others - you won't be disappointed!",
