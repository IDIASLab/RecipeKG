For those who can't have eggnog because of the cholesterol it is a nice subtitute. The coffee needs a little something else though. I seen on-line that eggnog syrup can be purchased. I am waiting for a recipe for it. Either way I did top it with a little lite whipped cream and then the nutmeg as suggested. TY",
