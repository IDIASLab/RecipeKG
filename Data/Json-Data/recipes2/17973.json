I'm new to cooking so I've been looking for quick and easy recipes using stuff I have in the pantry. This was it! The only thing I did not have was the cilantro so I left it out. I will definitely make this again. Next time I think I will substitute the garlic powder for minced garlic. My husband thought there were too many apples. There were a lot. It wouldn't hurt to cut this part by half. They made it a little sweet but not too much. I just ate the apples he didn't want because I thought they were great. Also I did not peel the apple and it was fine. Thanks for a great recipe. One I would serve to dinner guests.",

I tweaked it by adding low-sodium chicken broth when I realized that the onions and vinegar would not supply enough moisture. I also free-handed the spices adding at least twice to three times the amount of spices mentioned in the recipe. Sprinkled some cumin on as well as one of the other reviewers recommended and a sprinkling of sea salt. Used Mexican salsa verde sauce for the final touch; my husband used plain yogurt to tone down the spiciness but liked the combination of the sauce with the yogurt. Definitely a dish I would make again!!! Thank you for the recipe!",
