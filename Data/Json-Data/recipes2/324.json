Was I surprised! I wouldn't change a thing, and I'll definitely be making this again. The salsa is also very flavorful and refreshing. NOTE: There is lime juice listed in the ingredients, but not mentioned in the directions. The juice likely goes in the salsa, but I had omitted it at first since I was following the directions. It wasn't until halfway through my meal that I realized I hadn't used lime juice, then added it to the salsa. I have to say the salsa is good either way. I served the chicken over lime-cilantro rice. Yummy!",

It was delicious!  I wondered about using cucumbers, I'd never thought about mixing them with avocado.  Something about the crunch, added to the creamy avocado, with a bit of lime juice and salt--this was not just a salsa.  It was a side!  I could easily do this as a salad on lettuce for lunch, even without the chicken.  This will be even better a bit later in the season, when cucumbers are sweeter and tomatoes are at their peak!  Will definitely do again!",

I served it with cilantro-lime rice (Texmati rice butter fresh lime juice chopped cilantro) and the combination of flavors and textures was out of this world. The avocado salsa MAKES this dish. I seeded both the tomato and the cucumber and it turned out perfectly.

I grilled the chicken on the BBQ instead of frying it in the pan but used the olive oil lightly brushed on the chicken before rubbing it with the seasonings. I could not find the ground red pepper at my grocery store so I just used red pepper flakes and tried to crush them up as best I could. It was a bit spicy but we love spicy so all was good! I adore avocados so I doubled the avocado in the salsa and only used a couple of tablespoons of cilantro since I am very sensitive to its strong flavor. Love this dish - the spicy chicken contrasting with the cool and creamy avocados! Delish!",
