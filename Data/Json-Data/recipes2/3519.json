But this 1st time making it I just used some leftover grilled corn on the cab that came with the take outs we had for lunch. To enhance the Tex-Mex flair I used lime juice instead of balsamic vinegar and just 1/2 cup of it. I omitted the black olives my youngest doesn't like them. I served couple of slices of avocados next to the salad on each plate. Next time I might chop some avocados and mixed them in the salad.",

                "reviewBody": "This was excellent! I did make a couple of changes but only in method and not in ingredients. For the corn I left the ears whole and grilled them that way and then cut the kernels from the cob once they were cool enough to handle. So no oil was needed in that step. My other change was in step 3. I added the cilantro and jalapeno to the bowl with the other veggies instead of whisking them in with the dressing. Everything gets mixed and marinated together for 2 hours in the end so I didn't want to muddle up my cilantro more than I had to. Both me and hubby really enjoyed this and it is one I will make again. I will say that it is pretty tart which is how we like it but if you want to mellow it out some you might add a teaspoon of sugar to your dressing. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!",
