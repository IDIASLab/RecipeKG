Everyone has their own \"signature way\" of preparing tuna salad and like many others I did tweak this a bit for 1 can of tuna using a little more mayo less seasoning and onion. I toasted my English muffin and didn't bother buttering it then layered the tuna salad and cheese putting the oven at 400 and waiting until the cheese was nice and bubbly! I topped it with a tomato slice and a little cracked black pepper - delish!",
