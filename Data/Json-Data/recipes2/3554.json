I added a sprinkle of garlic powder and onion powder to the flour mixture along with ground pepper then cooked it in the olive oil. I allowed it to brown very lightly and it was awesome. When the sauce was simmering I added some sun-dried tomatoes that enhanced the taste and gave it some color. Served with rice and broccoli and makes a great dish. Thanks for the recipe..",
