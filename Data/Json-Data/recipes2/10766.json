With that being said, I give this recipe 5 stars as written.  I'm on a diet and so tired of eating plain veggies, so I was looking for something different to do with cabbage and found this recipe.  I ate it more like a salad than a topping, but it was so very tasty.  Finally, something I can eat guilt free.  Thank you for sharing mixingmedias.",

Well I looked and found this recipe.  It is so good and I will probably make it every time I make Mexican food. This would also be good on hot dogs, smoked sausage, hamburgers and sloppy joes.  I bought a package of pre-cut slaw and it had the carrots already included, but I added the rest of the ingredients.  This was a wonderful topping for \"Mexican Beef Supreme\" on AR.  The leftovers were a bit spicier the next day, due to the jalape\u00f1os, but it was still wonderful.  Thanks mixingmedia for sharing this recipe.  This is my 400th recipe made and posted in the year 2011.  Happy New Year's eveyone!",
