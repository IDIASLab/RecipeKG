I followed the recipe except for the grapes.  Since I didn't have the grapes I put in the entire PEELED apple in chunks.  I didn't have vanilla flavored yogurt (too much sugar in that product) so I used plain yogurt and after tasting the recipe added 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed and 1 teaspoon organic agave (low glycemic sweetener that looks like honey).  To make the smoothie colder I added some crushed ice (this does make it thinner).  The smoothie will definitely become a BIG hit on this site!!  I will make this weekly!! I will use another reviewers suggestion to get the kids to try it by having a \"green\" food coloring bottle on the counter!!",

Spinach is boss and a green smoothie will taste like spinach if you leave out a simple ingredient. a banana. Banana is boss over spinach so if you add a banana. any frozen fruit yogurt and a liquid you will not taste spinach and the banana calms the overly fruity taste and does not over-power. Kids would probably love this with this 1 additional ingredient. For an extra boost we also add a packet of emergen-c vitamin c drink. The kids won't touch that stuff otherwise.",

The only thing I didn't like about this recipe was that it was chewy. This was mostly due to leaving the skin on the apple. I would not do that again. Our blender couldn't seem to handle it and I was left with a chewy apple skin aftertase. Overall good recipe. Not something I would eat every day but for a once-in-a-while health food snack it was very good.",
