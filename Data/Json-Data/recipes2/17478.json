I followed the directions almost exactly except I added fresh ground pepper (I put it in practically everything) and I sprinkled paprika on top of the crescent roll dough to add a nice color to the crust. I used the reduced fat crescent rolls too just to lower the fat content some and reduced sodium chicken broth. Although I think this stew more accurately serves 4 than 8.",
