I followed the advice from the review by Saveur, and marinated my shrimp in the mayo mix ahead, for about two hours. I did add in some good shakes of Old Bay Seasoning to the mayo mix, fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt, and added in some shakes of Parsley also. We grilled over a wood fire just until pinked up, took about two to three minutes each side, so watch your grilling time  depending on shrimp size and fire temperature.",
