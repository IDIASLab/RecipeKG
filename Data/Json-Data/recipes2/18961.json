Go SLOWLY! That way you don't run out or waste any cookies because they weren't cut down the middle correctly! Make sure you don't get the generic brand cookies either b/c they don't have a hole in the middle making the shape you need! Also it helps to have the hersheys unwrapped and cookies cut for the 24 cupcakes (or however many - that's just the amount a normal cake batter makes). That way you can do them all at once which means less handling (messing up your wings) and you can stick in the fridge! I also like sticking the wings INTO the cupcake and straight up followed by the hershey kiss in front of it so the kiss doesn't rise up (tips tends to rise up if you angle it at all instead of putting them flat)! Everyone at my husband's office loved them and thought I was sooo creative. hehehehe Such a great idea that doesn't take too much work. Made these along with the spider cupcakes on this site!",
