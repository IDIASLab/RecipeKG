Think you have to batter them for that to work out? As far as the dip I did make a few changes and it was so amazing I ran out of sweet potatoes and started looking for other things to dip in it in the fridge (settled on sweet mini peppers.. also a great pairing)! Here is what I did differently: I heated the oil then added 1 clove of minced garlic and 1 shallot chopped about 30 seconds after the garlic. I had made breaded tenderloin in the pan just before so that have contributed to the flavor. After sauteeing for about 3 minutes I added a scoop (maybe 1/2 tablespoon) of red curry paste as I could not find my curry powder. I mixed it in well then spooned it all out into a bowl and added about 1/2 cup of ketchup. I then found the curry powder and added a dash or two. OMG is all I can say it was amazing!",

I wasn't looking for a candied type recipe...shooting more for a vegetable thing. I added a couple cloves or smashed diced garlic to the dip without looking at the limited number of reviews. Added more Curry as well...plus a bit of Turmeric (I have no idea about what I was trying to do). I used less salt than called for on the SPF (sweet potato fries) plus used some Smoked Paprika in the sauce vs regular Paprika (don't ask me why). I just flipped them after 15 minutes...stay tuned. They smell good. I also have continued to add MORE Curry to the sauce to the possible point of too much be sure to taste the sauce as you're going. The result is very good for my first time with Sweet Potato's. BTW the were the most red ones of 3 varieties at the grocery store (more Vit A).",

They tasted good nothing outstanding and if made as directed pulling them out at 20 min. would've been too squishy for us. The curry ketchup on the other hand was AWESOME.
