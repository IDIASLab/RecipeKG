Also, the cocoa powder and butter really need to mix for awhile, and get a spatula in there to make sure it's not at the bottom of the mixer...I found a little residue at the bottom after I added the powdered sugar.  I made this to frost chocolate pound cake from this site, and didn't end up using it (the cake stands alone and the frosting just wasn't good enough)...I'll let my kids decide if they want to put it on the cake or just on graham crackers later!",
