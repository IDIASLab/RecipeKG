Instead of brandy, I injected rum into the strawberries, let them sit for about an hour to marinate, then dipped them into chocolate.  Did not try to add liquor or cream to the chocolate mixture, just dipped them into chocolate that was melted over a simmering water. This recipe is very versatile as you can insert what ever liquor you prefer into the strawberries.  Excellent idea!  These are always requested at girls night.  But as another reviewer mentioned, there are occasions of escaping streams of liquor while trying to inject strawberries.",

I felt the strawberries were too strong and would probably change them by not adding the grand marnier to the chocolate. Also by not adding the grand marnier the chocolate would have had a more smoother look to it. Or it may just be that orange brandy isn't my type of liquor. My friend on the other hand loved them. And people we gave them to as gifts thought they were fabulous. I also made a batch of plain strawberries just in case people didn't like the bradied ones. So they were still enjoyable regardless. I would definitely make them again to give out as gifts. Something to keep in mind... while infusing the strawberries watch for shooting streams of alcohol:-)",

I didn't have a syringe in the house so I took another reviewer's advice and used a skewer. I poked 3 tunnels in the small end of each strawberry and they stayed upright on the leaf end. I used a pastry tip as a funnel to pour the liquor in. After a half hour in the fridge the liquor either soaked into the strawberries or solidified enough that it did not leak out when I turned the strawberries upside down to dip. I made some with rum some with rum cream and some with Bailey's. I thought the ones with Bailey's were best but they were all delicious.",

This time I used 1/2 the amt. of chocolate (because I purchased the last of the chocolate that the store had) and once again it thickened.
