When I asked him if he liked it he told me he did and told me I was going to say it needs more garlic. Little stinker...anyway I'd add fresh minced garlic next time but all in all it's worth repeating. I didn't realize it needed to sit in the fridge for a while and so I just made it then put it on the bread right away which was fine. Thanks for the recipe!",
