Every eggless cake I make is crumbly and doesn't hold together well. I was amazed how moist and solid this cake was after making it for the first time today. It was extremely easy to prepare. I baked it about 5 minutes too long because the outside of the cake developed a \"crust\" with a chewey texture. The crust is shiny. Other than that the cake was very good. It rose very well and did not sink. I would probably add a little sugar when I make it again because I felt it needs to be a touch more sweeter. It has a hint of orange flavor and scent from the juice. I didn't use a mixer just stired it until everything was thoroughly mixed. If you over mix an eggless batter it will deflate. I would say this is the best eggless cake I've made to date and I will definitely make it again.",

We recently decided to make cupcakes for my co-teacher's birthday, so I was in search of a simple, easy (after all, this was cooking with 3 year olds), and most importantly delicious recipe. I was a little bit worried as some reviewers claimed it was obvious that it was egg-free to regular egg eaters. But, as an egg eater & dessert lover, I can honestly say this cake was better than the boxed stuff and just as simple to make! (Changes I made were 1 tbsp. vanilla & 2 tbsp. sugar to make it a touch sweeter. Cooked in cupcake pan for around 25-30 minutes.) So yummy, esp. w/vanilla frosting! Will definitely be making again for my class & for myself!",

This cake is definitely plain (with a capital P!) but for those who cannot eat eggs I'm sure it is the best alternative. It definitely has a cake like texture and look but it tastes like cornbread to me. You cannot taste the orange juice at all and actually the cake is not very sweet which is probably where a glaze or frosting would help. After some additional thought Cream Cheese frosting might do wonders for this cake. Regardless if you are going to make this be prepared to be VERY creative and dress it up somehow.",
