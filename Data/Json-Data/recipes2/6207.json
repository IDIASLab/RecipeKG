I make the full amount of the recipe in a small bowl, let the flavors meld overnight, then strain it into an empty soy sauce bottle.  We pour it directly onto our gyoza (preventing waste), and the bottle goes into the freezer to keep until we need it again.  I strain out the solids so (1) it doesn't continue getting spicier and (2) the freezer doesn't affect anything oddly.",
