        "description": "A super-simple yet tasty recipe from a very novice chef. I am a divorced father who is slowly learning to cook for myself. I have 2 teenagers who hate fish, but will often request this! It's so simple that my 14-year-old daughter has been making it herself for almost 5 years! This recipe works best with salmon pieces that are 1/2 to 3/4 pound each. Serve with some wild rice and maybe a salad, and you have a quick and tasty meal. Any brown mustard will work, but I prefer the Grey Poupon&reg; due to the white wine flavor. Just retain the 2:1 mustard-to-honey ratio if making more sauce. The sauce also works well as a marinade if prepared in advance, and also serves well as a salad dressing.",
