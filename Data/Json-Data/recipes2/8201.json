Next, I used the broth that it made, added 1 and 1/3 cups of 2 % milk, 1 jar of mushroom alfredo sauce and frozen green beans, corn, pea and carrots.  I had to cook twice as long as the recipe suggests to get the bisquik done.  Total awesomeness!",

Only thing different is that I use raw boneless chicken cut into pieces. It's done just right in the time it takes for dumplings to cook. I do add what ever veges I have on hand, usually organic carrots and green beans. Remember, you need the beginning liquid to be thin, it thickens up when the dumpling are finished cooking. Yum.",

The dumplings will thicken the gravy so anyone who says it was too thin should know to let it sit a while or add just a bit more butter mixed with flour to the gravy.
