Also cut way down on ratio of pasta to veggies based on other reviewers comments. My noodles were a tiny bit warm when I mixed them with the veggies dressing and cheese and I liked that this helped the gorgonzola crumbles melt a bit and cover the pasta. I think adding crumbled bacon would take this salad to the next level as a main dish. Yum!",
