Not sure if that was my original doing or from Allrecipes posting. The amount of baking powder should be 2 teaspoons not 2 tablespoons. Also if you would like to omit the baking powder all together use self rising flour. Using self rising flour would omit the use of all-purpose flour and baking powder all together. This substitution makes for a super fluffy onion ring batter. I've used both variations and never had anyone not like them. An additional note: After removing the onion rings from the hot oil one can quickly shake some additional onion salt if you prefer. Also these can be dipped into original batter and then quickly dipped into bread crumbs for crunchier onion rings. It's all about preferences.",

I only had one onion but I was really craving onion rings so I halved the batter and it was perfect. I also used garlic powder in stead of the onion salt because 1. I love garlic powder in almost everything and 2. I didn't have any onion salt! lol I also only sprinkled some salt on the top at the end instead of in the batter (I'm not much of a \"salty\" person). Quick and easy... definitely a keeper!: )",
