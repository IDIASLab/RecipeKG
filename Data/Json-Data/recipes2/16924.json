I prepared it as the recipe directed, gave it a taste for seasoning (salt and pepper), was satisfied, so I thought, with the 3-star rating I planned on giving it and put it in the fridge.  And then I took it back out of the fridge, not completely happy with it. While it certainly was ok and acceptable, it lacked contrasts in color and textures and the flavor fell somewhat flat.  It lacked interest.  It was sort of boring. So I went to work on it to take care of all my criticisms - I added sliced celery, chopped green onion, and thawed, frozen peas.  Added a little more mayonnaise to compensate for the additions.  Gave it a taste and it was much improved. I put it back in the fridge and as I did so I noticed the bacon I had in there....  I pulled it back out, nuked some bacon till crisp and folded it into the shrimp salad.  These additions definitely elevated this to 5 stars and was SO good it never made it till lunchtime.",
