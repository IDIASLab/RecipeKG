Also when adding the cheese, GO SLOWLY do a handful at a time and stir until that handful is gone, then do the next. Recipes amounts are perfect, although I had to use half & half instead of whole milk and did 4 oz Monterrey Jack and 4 oz sharp cheddar. That's another thing: grate your cheese yourself. Pre-shredded cheese is coated in a mixture that inhibits clumping which can make it harder to incorporate. Hope this helps!",
