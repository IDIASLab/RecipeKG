I skipped on the powdered egg whites because 1) I hadn't heard of them, 2) I didn't have them, and 3) a reviewer said it was $11!! I wouldn't say it's necessary because it is delicious without it. It's a classic recipe anyone can tweak to his or her desire. I added an extra quarter cup milk for a smoother milkshake. On one serving, I also added about a tsp of the white chocolate caramel powder coffee mix for an interestingly different and delicious taste! Be creative and enjoy!! =]",
