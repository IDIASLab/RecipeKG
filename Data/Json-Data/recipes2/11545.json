However I ran into a problem with taste:/ My family and I felt this was very salty and the Ranch and salt made the tomatoes taste very acidic. I am not sure if it's the Ranch seasoning or the additional salt that did it but if you choose this recipe I think the additional sea salt is best left out. Otherwise it's easy they become a nice golden color and have very good texture. I am sorry that we didn't enjoy it.",
