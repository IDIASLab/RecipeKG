Our family likes the oriental flavor the best & I use plain shredded cabbage if its available. The biggest difference is that we use 1/3 c. vinegar, 1 c. oil & 1/2 c. (or less) of sugar (or even splenda). It really isn't necessary to refrigerate first & you definitely don't want to let it set too long. It is best fresh for the crunch factor. If you make these changes you most likely will like it better yet.",

Bought one of the pre-shredded packages of coleslaw (w/ carrots) and one Ramen chicken one beef. I think that was an accident rushing through the store but it seemed to be a \"happy accident\". After crushing the noodles and throwing them in with the slaw I used both the chicken and beef flavoring packets in the vinegar then tossed it into the slaw. Left overnight in the fridge and tasted next day. Both the husband and I were completely blown away by how good this tasted. Who would ever think to use those flavor packets in vinegar? GENIUS!! The packets flavor the vinegar perfectly and only dampen the tang just a bit. The slaw is so good you will never miss mayo or sugar. No need to add any other seasoning or anything at all. The whole thing is also pretty diet friendly so no guilt. Just be careful on the amount of noodles used because they puff up from the liquid (like in the soup) and may overcome the cabbage. SUPER YUMMY! Thank you SloppyJo!",
