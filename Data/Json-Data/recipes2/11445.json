It's a perfect dish to use up leftover broccoli stalks that don't fit into other meals. It freezes well and makes a great winter warm-up snack or lunch! Can be served immediately, seasoned with black pepper, curry powder, or even grated cheese (for people who don't mind dairy) or can be frozen in individual portions and microwaved later.",
