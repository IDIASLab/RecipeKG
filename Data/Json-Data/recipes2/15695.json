I was shocked how much XXX sugar it asked for so I used only 1/3 of a box when other reviews said it was so sweet. I also took their advice and used only half the chocolate chips. My only problem was I had no cake mix so I used a packaged muffin mix and it did fine. The cooking time and oven temp is not right and I bumped it up to 325 like the others did. The consistancy is good and I had no problems with runniness. But would have liked a denser cream cheese -- this is a bit spongy. I am giving this only two stars because I had to change the recipe for it to come out right on the advice of the other reviews. Taste is okay but nothing special-- won't make them again.",
