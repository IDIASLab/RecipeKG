(the 1st time was a trial run and the 2nd for thanksgiving dinner ) i kept in fridge overnight and until it was time to serve and it got quite runny after a short time sitting on counter. the 2nd time i froze it overnight and transferred to the frige in the morning until time to serve. this was much better! i really wanted something different and unique and this was excellent! the only other thing i recommend is that you look up the meaning of fold in a cook book -that helped me the 2nd time. i have been asked to bring this for x-mas as well --- thanks rodney!",

I let it cool completly in the refrig.  When it was time to beat/mix the cooled pudding it was to thick so I had to beat it with some of the whipped cream first.  When it was beat then I folded in the rest of the whipped cream.  It set nicely.  Next time I think I will try it with a graham cracker crust.",
