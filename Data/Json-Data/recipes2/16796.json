I had dried Michigan cherries in my fridge so I used them(finally a use those cherries) and am glad I did because they were a tad tart. Also I took about a cup of the juice and thickened it a little for a sauce which was also a hit with the Mister. This is a keeper. Thanks Jaynine!",

I like my chicken crispy so after 45 min cooking in Dutch oven I took pieces out of sauce and placed them in a Pyrex baking dish - another 15 min at 450 - 500 F. Also added fresh cranberries at this point - added a little tangy flavor. The chicken formed wonderful crust and all cranberries mixed together into sweet-and-sour clusters. Saved orange sauce was used to pour over the rice. If you follow these instructions keep the sauce in a separate container - this way chicken will stay crispy.",

For the sauce I cut the orange juice down to 1 cup and simmered the chicken in the marmalade/juice/cranberries for 10 minutes. Then I stirred in 1/2 tsp. salt along with 2 Tbsp. cornstarch mixed with 2 Tbsp. orange juice and simmered the dish for 5 minutes more. It was perfect--moist sweet and delicious. I served it with long grain and wild rice salad and bread for a very tasty meal. Thank you for a wonderful new family favorite!",
