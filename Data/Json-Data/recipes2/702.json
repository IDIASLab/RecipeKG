The sauce was rich and delicious.  The only adjustment I had to make was that my chuck roast was still tough after cooking on high for five hours, so I had to cook it another five hours.  Next time I'll start earlier and cook for 10-12 hours on low.  Highly recommend this recipe.  Surprised it doesn't have more reviews.",

If anything due to the sodium amount in the nutritional info I would probably not add the salt to the spices and look for a low salt version of the cream of mushroom soup.

I will give this one five stars because this was the easiest and most tender pot roast I have ever made.  5 hours on high and I added 4 cloves of garlic [crushed] and 12-14 cremini mushrooms [halved].  I coated the roast in flour, kosher salt, and Herbs de Provence and browned to a nice crust.  You need a 6 qt or better cooker.  All I can say is the guests were all saying yum, yum, yum.

I skipped the step of browning the roast, left the skins on my potatoes and whole carrots, used whole onions, and did not thicken the sauce at the end. I layered everything in the crockpot as the recipe stated. Cooked it until the meat came apart easily in small hunks which allowed the juices soak into it.

Removed the onions and put them over the other vegetables. Then I added the meat to the pan and browned it. I did add salt/pepper/garlic powder to the meat and deglaze the pan with a bit of white wine to get those brown bits and poured this over the meat. I also added a few sliced mushrooms too that I had to use up. At this point I put the crock point insert in the fridge overnight. I mixed up the sauce in a separate bowl and refrigerated. In the morning I put on the dish after pouring on the sauce. About 4 hours into cooking I did add one packet of beef bouillion dissolved in a cup of hot water as I was concerned that there wasn't enough liquid to fully cook all of the vegetables. I cooked it for 10 hours. The broth and dish was delicious and the house smelled great. I didn't thicken the sauce and liked it just fine as it was. So did my husband and son!! I will definitly make this agaain. Thank you for the recipe.",
