Next time, I'll take the author's advice, and cut back on the amount of green curry paste.  A previous reviewer's suggestion for adding a 1/2 cup of rice is also a good idea.\n\nI wish to comment on some of the other reviews posted here:  It's absurd to rate a recipe you haven't made.  When you radically change the recipe before making it, well...you haven't exactly made the recipe, have you?  Very minor modifications are one thing.  Cutting the broth in half, so it isn't a SOUP, or replacing a carrot for onions and bell peppers are not minor modifications.  Reviewers on this site constantly take liberty with recipes (which is great, I do too), but then rate the recipe they radically change. It's a disservice to the recipe author.",

I also looked at my jar of curry paste which recommended adding 2 tablespoons brown sugar. Next time I'll probably add the carrots and maybe green peppers. It was so good. We'll definitely be making this again.",

I thought this was good but I think it needs less chicken broth (like 3 cups for 4 servings) to make it thicker like similar soups I've had and it would probably benefit from some rice (especially basmati rice) and maybe some ground peanuts. Overall good (and smells REALLY good) but needs some tweaking.",

(I had doubled soup recipe because it sounded delish and got good reviews and I was really hungry!) Then I added another T. Then another! It didn't take long before I had emptied the jar into the soup and was barely aware of any spices. So either everyone in the world than me is a weenie or I got a particularly mild bottle. As for the soup spicy or not it was delicious. However I review it delicately because as someone pointed out if you change the recipe radically then you really can't comment on the original recipe. I forgot to pick up green onions so I ended up using a roughly chopped white onion. And then I had some red and green peppers leftover in the fridge and knowing how pretty that would look I roughly chopped the peppers and threw them in. (It did look pretty: the red and green of the peppers and the ornage of the carrots against the pale chartreuse of the soup.) Then because I was still looking for bite I started sprinkling in caynee but I stopped rpetty quickly because it was changing the oclor of the soup. I will state that the soup was good and then adding the fresh squeeze leime juice made it go: \"POW!\" Totally took it up 4 star. Bon apetit!",

The spiciness/pungency of the curry paste you use must vary significantly because 1 tbs did not make mine very flavorful or at all spicy. We were dumping red pepper and soy sauce in our bowls to give it more flavor. I used Thai Kitchen brand which i've enjoyed for other recipes...but if I make this again i'll have to add more than called for even though other reviewers said theirs turned out too spicy. You really have to season to taste with this one. I also added some celery yellow onion and red bell pepper which was nice. I'll also add less stock so its thicker if there is a next time.",
