Make sure to get pitted dates; it's a real pain to pit them yourself:) All in all it's a time-consuming recipe but well-worth it if you want to wow your guests.",

I also did a little extra honey- and I used what I had in the cupboard which was wildflower honey. For the bacon, I followed other people's comments and used thick cut hickory smoked bacon. Also, I put tin foil on the cookie sheet before baking them so I didn't have to clean the mess. I then baked them at 400\u00b0 for 15 minutes, flipping once half way through. Then broiling at the end to crisp them. While they were greasy (which was inevitable due to the use of bacon and cheese), and I had to push some of the cheese back in, they were to die for delicious. They were all eaten the minute I put them out. I will definitely make them again! I suggest putting them on a paper towel first before serving them to let the grease soak off.",
