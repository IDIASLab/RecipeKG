In fact he has requested that it be a \"tradition\" on Monday nights when he watches his football games. I used the Hormel Chili with no beans. I think next time I will garnish it with some other Nacho things like tomatoes sour cream guacomole and hubby says especially sliced jalapenos for him. Thanks for sharing. I love these kind of filling easy-on-the-budget homecooked meals",
