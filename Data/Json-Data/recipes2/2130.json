My only issue: it solidifies extremely quick after heating & removing from heat. So, if you have one of the mini slow cookers- keeping it in that is ideal to keep it at the warm, creamy consistency. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to keep warming it if it sits for more than 30 minutes, having to stir it before it begins to solidify. Served this with some Frito scoops & tortilla chips- perfect combo for taco night, as many opted to \u201csauce\u201d up their tacos, too!",
