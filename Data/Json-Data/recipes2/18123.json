I used a few other vegetables also, like carrots, celery and mushrooms...We like lots of veggies. My children loved this meal as well. Thanks Jean!***",

This week I got a bargain on fresh pineapple so was looking for a recipe to use it, and this was a good one.  In addition to the fresh pineapple instead of canned, I substituted jalapeno peppers for some of the green, since I had a surplus from my garden.  This added a kick to the sweet-sour flavor.  I didn't have mirin, either, so drizzled a little honey into the mix.  I am puzzled by the reviewer who said she substituted honey for corn syrup, as there is no corn syrup in the original recipe.  Perhaps she mis-read cornstarch, which is what thickens the sauce and doesn't add any flavor.  I am used to marinating my chicken for a little while, so I poured the sauce ingredients over the chicken while I chopped the vegetables, then strained it off again before cooking the chicken in a wok.  Remove the chicken and then wok the vegetables, starting with hard ones (I used carrots, too) and adding the tender ones, ending with the pineapple.  Delicious!!",
