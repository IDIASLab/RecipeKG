I often rate the recipes I try highly, with five stars, but it's difficult to differentiate when something I try is even better than that. This one is.  I was tempted to used roasted red peppers for this, thinking the fresh red bell peppers wouldn\u2019t provide enough flavor. Wrong.  I added some fresh minced garlic for complexity and depth but other than that I didn\u2019t deviate from the recipe and, other than adding salt and pepper, won\u2019t the next time I make this either.  Interestingly, it was equally as delicious without the sour cream as it was with it. I served this with \u201cSimply Parmesan Chicken,\u201d recipe also from this site, and linguine, but the possibilities for using this are endless.",
