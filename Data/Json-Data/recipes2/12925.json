It's not burn your mouth spicy, but there's definitely a kick. I can't wait to make it again.\n\nSafety tip: Don't put the squash peelings in the disposal. I thought I was fine, but ended up with a majorly clogged sink. Rookie mistake on my part.",

I'm sure it would only be better with the real thing. I served it with finely chopped bacon on top. The combo of the sweet bisque with the salty bacon was outstanding.
