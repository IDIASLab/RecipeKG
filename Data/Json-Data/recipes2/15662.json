I added a can of corn a can of green beans & 2 handfuls of fresh green beans trimmed & snapped. I put an even layer of garlic powder onion powder parsley salt Tony's & Lawry's across the top & I added 1 can of Campbell's tomato soup 2 tbs of minced garlic & an extra carrot along w/about 1/4 of an onion chopped very fine. I only put 2 potatoes because 4 was too much. I also cooked it on the stove instead of in the oven bringing it to a boil & then letting it simmer until all the veggies were tender & the meat was fully cooked. It was FANTASTIC. If I could figure out how to add a recipe I'd add this one for sure!",
