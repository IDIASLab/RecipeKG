They come in a Yellow rectangular box and are usually found on the top shelf in the cookie aisle or with the ice cream toppings.  Sometimes they are only available around the holidays.  The frosted cookies are laid on their side in a long row and then the whole thing is frosted with more whipped cream.  This does not work with Cool Whip!  It won't soak into the cookies to make the cake-like filling.  This recipe is usually a dessert that the kids help with.  They make the stacks of frosted cookies and put them on a plate and I put the cookies on a platter in a row. I save any broken cookies and crush them to sprinkle on the top.  We always called this Holiday Log.  YUM!",

I made the original version but sprinkled Starbucks instant coffee over the top instead of grated chocolate.  REALLY yummy.   For variety the 2nd time around, I used Trader Joe's Cookie Thins which are also a wafer cookie just like the chocolate Nabiscos, but they come in different flavors like lemon and coconut.   The coconut crisp wafers are buttery and light and make a superb version of this cake.   Something so good is usually not this simple.   I'm lovin' it.",
