Other than that, I use a can of jalapenos and some of the jalapeno juice and omit that butter.

I am a garlic lover & all my life I have said \"you can never have too much garlic for me\".  Well I can't say that anymore.  2 tsp of garlic powder is equivalent to 16 cloves of garlic! in 1LB of cheese?!?  >> On to the fix...\n1st let me address the best cheese to use...  \"Land o Lakes Extra Melt American Cheese\".  This comes from the Land o Lakes Foodservice (a.k.a. restaurant) line which is sold in large quantity & not readily available at the grocery store.  I found it at a local Mexican Supermarket but I had to buy a 5LB package for $18.  That's a lot of cheese!  Also key is to heat the milk & butter in your pan (no dbl broiler req'd) on low heat until hot.  Then grate the cheese & add a little bit at a time to the hot milk stirring & letting it melt slowly.  Do not be temped to turn the eye above the low setting even for a sec :o)  >>  Ok now on to the ingredient amounts that I used:  16oz Land o Lakes Extra Melt American Cheese; 1-1&1/2 cup milk depending on your thickness preference (if you want to use half & half you will need to use more); 1 TBSP butter; 1/4-1/2 cup diced jalapeno peppers with juice from a jar (adjust for your heat preference); 2 tsp cumin; 1/2 tsp garlic powder; 1/2 tsp onion powder; 1/2 tsp dried cilantro.  Use those ingredients in those quantities & you will have a 5 star rated taste-tested crowd pleaser!",

I will say that during the stirring and adding more milk I probably used double of what the recipe called for and added some more spices to account for that. I'm making it again this weekend and plan to be a little heavier handed with the spices to begin with since I know I'll be adding more milk than it originally called for. Either way, this is a SUPER easy and SUPER tasty white cheese dip recipe. Thanks for sharing!!",

The restaurant cheese dip isn't spicy to me just flavorful and kid friendly as is this dip. It is pretty thick so I added quite a bit more milk to bring it to the consistency I prefer. You can easily make this more spicy by adding more cayenne pepper red pepper flakes or even subbing jalapenos for 1 or both of the green chiles however I don't think it's necessary.",

Velveeta actually makes a whie American cheese in the big blocks now (in the unref part of the grocery store) to use for this.  I halved the amount of spices, and I can't imagine adding all of it.  I would suggest doing half, and then adding more to your tastes if you are interested in making this.  I also think the Mexican place I get this at uses jalepenos, and not green chiles.
