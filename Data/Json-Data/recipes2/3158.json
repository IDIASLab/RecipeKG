Overall I ended up adding some diced red bell pepper to the top at the end and I did not cook the green onion - without this it wasn't the most appetizing looking dip but was quite lovely with some color. Also in the future I would add a few more shrimp. This will serve 3-4 people as a generous appetizer so even though it says 12 servings I would count on that making enough for just a few people. Overall with some presentation help and making sure you don't want to serve 12 people with it - this was a nice recipe. Thanks!",

I would make it again but probably reduce the blue cheese a little I also added 2 tbls. of lemon when it's cooking to give it a little zip.",
