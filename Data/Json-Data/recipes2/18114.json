For some reason one small cup for me just doesn't cut it.  I used low sodium soy sauce and subbed sesame oil for the chili oil - I also added some finely chopped green onions.  If you want to make it a bit sweeter add just the tiniest bit of brown sugar. You can change it up with ginger as well.  Just play with it to suit your tastes.",
