I decided to try this recipe to pull my husband onto a healthier track and WOW! this is fantastic.  The prep took a very long time and I couldn't find miso paste.  I added garlic salt to the mashed potato mixture and it was great.  I can't say enough about this recipe.  The BBQ sauce adds just the right flavor.  I will have to remember how long this recipe takes to prepare, but beyond that, I will definitely be making it again.",

I also used Better than Boullion no chicken base for where it called for gravy or boullion and left out bbq sauce (my preference). You could use all kinds of different veggies.

That being said not sure if I'd tackle it again. It took me 1 hr. to prep and I don't agree with one of the reviews that states it's easy to follow. I consider myself an intermediate cook but this one made me feel like a beginner! I like to prep ahead of time for longer recipes and this one you cannot really prep ahead for. I left the skins on the potatoes. They're so good for you and it really made no difference in the end other than you're getting the nutrients (which is ALWAYS a benefit)! I was confused as to what to do with the ingredients used with boiling the potatoes. I did not include them in the mashing. Next time (if there is one) I will put the garlic parsley peppercorns and bay leaf in a tied cheese cloth and will finely chop (rely on your food processor for this recipe and it will go much faster) the celery onions and garlic and will include them in the potato topping for added flavor and reduced wasting. I did not use BBQ sauce but took another reviewer's suggestion and mixed about 2 tbsp. Miso and Tamari each for a substitute. Very flavorful. Also I too did use \"chicken gravy flavored mix\" but made my own \"gravy\" from the suggested whole wheat pastry flour nutritional yeast and vegetable stock added to thin it to a gravy consistency; I don't think it was missing anything.",
