I followed some other reviews and sauteed onion and garlic before adding the other ingredients. I didn't really measure the parm. I just added it until it was the consistancy that I wanted. This came together very nicely and had a great taste. I also added some parsley and black pepper at the end to the sauce for something extra. I will definately be using this recipe again!
