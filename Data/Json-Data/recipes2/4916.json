The only changes I made to this recipe were I cut the peas carrots and tomatoes in half. If I'd have put in the full can we wouldn't have been able to taste the meat or potatoes at all (personal preference.) It needed a little more seasoning for our tastes but even my picky seven year old (who hates most vegetables) cleaned his bowl.",
