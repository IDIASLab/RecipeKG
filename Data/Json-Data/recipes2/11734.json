I had never used dried chiles before it was a surprise to see how good & authentic it tasted. That being said if I wanted to take a shortcut I would try to buy a ready made sauce and skip the whole soaking the chiles and using the blender. One thing this recipe didn't mention but I added a cup of water to the pot before cooking then I cooked it for 20 minutes and the gravy and meat turned out perfect. My cooker defaulted to 1 hour when I hit the stew setting but I'm glad I made the adjustment for only 20 minutes or I think it would have overcooked. I used the flour to dredge the meat it took awhile but I think it added a good consistence to the gravy and more texture to the meat. Overall a great first experience my husband loved it too.",
