Add the crab when you add the other shell fish. I make a few variations to the recipe - I add 3-4 minced anchovy fillets when I add in the garlic. I also add the tomato paste and cook for a couple of minutes until nice and caramelized. I then add in the crab juices and \"butter\" along with a bottle of clam juice to deglaze the pan. On separate occasions I've used dry red & white wine as well as beer. They've all been great so I recommend using whatever your drinking to pair with the recipe. Also you only need one large pot for the recipe. You can saut\u00e9 everything right in the pot no need for a separate saut\u00e9 pan.",
