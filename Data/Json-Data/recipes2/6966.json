I made it with sweet and hot stone ground mustard instead of yellow mustard, because that is what I had. I think the yellow mustard would also have been delicious, but the stone ground mustard looks really pretty. I did like some other reviewers and browned the chops, then cooked them at 400 degrees for thirty minutes in the oven. I also cut up some small red potatoes and cooked them around the chops. My, oh my!!! That was soooo good! I served them with some green beans, which were good, but I think something a little more \"green\" to bring a little brightness to the dish would have really elevated it. Try this recipe. You will be glad you did!",

We like a lot of sauce, so I used 1/2 C. of honey, 3 Tbsp of spicy brown mustard, 1Tbsp stone ground mustard, & 1/2 Tbsp Mrs Dash garlic-herb blend. For the spice rub, I used 1Tbsp of the same garlic-herb blend, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, and 1/4 tsp salt. I used 5 thick pork chops & the spice mix covered both sides of the chops well. I also added 1 Tbsp olive oil with the butter to sear the meat. After searing both sides, I reduced the heat to low & brushed a small amount of the sauce mix on them & browned both sides again-watching to keep them from burning. I finished them in the oven at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes, covered. I got rave reviews from my husband and son, so this will definitely be added to our meal rotation.",
