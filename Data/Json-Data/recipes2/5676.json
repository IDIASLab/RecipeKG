The first time, I followed the recipe to a T, but the meatballs had to cook longer because they were extremely mushy. This time, I skipped the lemon rind, bread crumbs, and egg. They came out crispy on the outside and nicely firm on the inside. I would definitely make it again, eliminating the same 3 ingredients.",

I also must have made them smaller because they were a little over done at 25 min so I'd suggest checking them after 15-20 mins depending on how large your meatballs are rolled. I also didn't have seasoned meat so I added tastefully simple Italian garlic bread seasoning and the taste of the meatballs came out just amazing. The first time I also had a fresh lemon and second time used the lemon peel from a bottle and the fresh seemed to make it better but not by much. As always fresh ingredients always end up better but if you don't have it you're not missing out on too much. I will be making these again and perfecting some of the changes. Enjoy!",
