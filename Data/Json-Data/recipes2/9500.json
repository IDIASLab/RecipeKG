(Could be because I made it with our own Wisconsin frozen vanilla custard not yogurt and reduced the amount of honey) I asked him if he could tell me what was in it. He said that was difficult to answer as no single flavor was predominant. That s a good thing if you have a smoothie with multiple fruits right? He said he assumed there were strawberries in it but only because of its color. He called it pleasantly sweet and fruity. I call that good.",
