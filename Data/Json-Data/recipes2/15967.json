It is a recipe that I would now use for company - it would be a great easy meal for a shower or girl's get together since it could be cooked 3/4 way and finished before serving. Like others said use the amt. of ingredients you like best. I did 50-50 canned diced tomato and artichokes did add a little garlic used less peppers (diced very small) and the spices (dried). Also used shredded mozzarella since that's what I had (I wouldn't change that). Also I changed from marinara (I didn't want a heavy sauce) and used Emeril's \"Kicked Up Tomato\" which was light but spicy which was a hit here! I made angel hair pasta and just spooned the light sauce juices over it and ended up slicing the chicken rolls about 1 1/2\" thick which made such a beautiful presentation seeing the stuffing in the middle. I was so disappointed that I wasn't having company to see and experience this dish. A salad and some garlic bread would touch it off nicely. Maggie thanks so much for inventing this!! THIS IS A KEEPER - AND AN INEXPENSIVE DISH!",

I sauted three cloves of garlic (minced) with the vegetable mixture. I also mixed feta and mozarella cheeses. I have to say the wonderful aroma while it was baking roused even the teenagers out of their rooms! What I love about this recipe is that you can play around with it and it will still be delicious. A definite \"taste as you go\" cooking experience. Thanks for sharing it. We will make it again!",

I omited the pasta sauce because it just wasn't necessary and used canned diced tomatoes. I also used marinated artichoke hearts for extra flavor and chopped them very tiny so the kids wouldn't know what they were eating! I made sure to use fresh mozarella since that is one thing I really enjoy. Sometimes it's the little things that make a dish special. I spooned all the leftover filling on top of the stuffed chicken breasts as there was quite a bit left over. This was a very flavorful dish. I served it on a bed of angelhair pasta and my husband commented that it looked like a pricey dish at a restaurant.",
