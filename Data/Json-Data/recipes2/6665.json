I don't know if that was not included in my original posting or if something was lost in translation when the recipe was kitchen approved. Sorry!! You should add the crumbled bacon when you add the clams. As for the salt if should be a DASH OR TWO TO TASTE (you can taste the mixture before baking it and adjust) - NOT 2 TSP FOR THIS AMOUNT!

Also there was no mention of what size casserole dish to use (I would use an 8x8 dish or maybe a pie plate). When I read the reviews there was mention of the dish being too salty. With clam juice bacon and parmesan as ingredients of course it was going to be on the salty side...I omitted the 2 teaspoons of salt and glad I did...it was plenty salty enough without it! (not too salty). Also after you add the clams and crumbled bacon don't forget to remove the bay leaves. I will make this again but as a dip with Ritz crackers or in clam shells or over linguini with some olvie oil.",
