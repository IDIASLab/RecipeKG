To thicken the sauce, boil it down a little before adding the mussels, and afterwards, add a little heavy cream and boil it down more, while keeping the mussels warm, under a damp cloth in a low oven.  Works like a charm and you don't loose any flavour.",

I also tossed in a pinch of kosher salt to help sweat the shallots and garlic. I didn't really measure my ingredients and I think the key was to not overdo the wine. It can make the broth too sweet. And DO NOT use a grocery isle \"cooking wine.\" Use a real dry wine like sauvignon blanc or chardonnay. Also I kept an eye on my mussels and they all opened after about THREE minutes. I HIGHLY recommend taking the mussels off the heat as soon as they open. Once they open they're DONE. They were SO tender and melted in my mouth. Five minutes would have made them chewy. My friends tonight said they were the best mussels they've ever had! I was inclined to agree:)",
