After reading some of the other reviews I decided to broil for a few minutes to crisp up the tortilla pieces. The cheese was bubbling and golden. There was a bit of an unfortunate accident with my green onions-they landed on the floor. I imagine they would have tasted great in the dish! I used fresh cilantro and avocado as toppers. Pretty yummy meal. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/46653/taco-seasoning-i/",

We added taco toppings like shredded lettuce chopped tomatoes and fat free sour cream. Next time I will try it with black beans instead of the kidney beans.
