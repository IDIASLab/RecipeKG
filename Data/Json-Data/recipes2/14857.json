Modifications I made were the following: Used black beans instead of kidney beans (wife does not care for kidney beans) Added a can of diced tomatoes and chilis Seasoned with garlic white pepper and black pepper. Topped with Mexican shredded cheese and fried tortilla strips. SIMPLY AWESOME!!! Leftovers I used basic tortilla chips with the shreeded cheese and it was just as good (if not better after letting the flavors meld overnight).",

I added extra cumin, some garlic salt, a can of Rotel Mexican tomatoes with cilantro, peppers, lime and diced tomatoes and also added a small package of Velveeta cheese. Instead of plain cubed chicken breast meat, I bought a rotisserie chicken at Sam's and shredded that up. I LOVE Mexican and TexMex food, and with a little bit of shredded Monterey Jack on top and some crumbled tortilla chips, this made the perfect-tasting Mexican soup. I will definitely make this slightly varied version again!",
