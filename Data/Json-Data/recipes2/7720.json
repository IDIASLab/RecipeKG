She washed the rice 2 times in a bowl with the same amount of water each time (1 cup for 1 cup of rice), stirring the rice with a clean hand, fingers spread out  like you are clawing something. Stir it until the water get's really cloudy (about 1-2 minutes), pour out, repeat.  The 3rd time, we fill the bowl with same amount of water, and knead the rice with one hand for about 3-4 minutes. You know when to stop when the majority of your rice grains looks clear. Pour out the water. (Save the water if you would like rice tea). Fill the bowl with same amount of water and let it sit in your fridge for at least 20 minutes.  When time is up, look at how white your rice turned.  Pour your rice and water into a pan. Bring to a boil, and then immediately pop on a lid, and turn heat down to allow to simmer. Start your timer for 13 minutes. DO NOT LIFT THE LID (or use a glass lid if you need to see what's going on in there). When the timer dings, remove from heat with lid ON for 10 minutes. When the timer dings a second time, lift the lid and check out your awesome rice. You can shape into sushi, rice balls, whatever you wish. My kids now eat rice regularly with their bento lunches.  The rice does well for about 2 days in a sealed container in the fridge. We season lightly with salted and toasted sesame seeds.  Hope this helps!",

At least that's what I think, and it seems to be what I've eaten in every sushi restaurant I've visited - ever. To be super simple:  equal amounts rice wine vinegar and sugar, and half that amount of salt.  Microwave or heat over the stove until solids dissolve.  Epicurious adds a piece of kombu for flavor, which I usually do.",

I followed the direction but I didn't like the texture of the rice on this recipe. it was too hectic to wash out and then dry out but then ended up with too sticky like the glue.

Asian Medium grain rice is typically stay sticky side than fancy long grain rice anyways so all of wash and dry 1 hour and then cooking step wasn't necessary. I am all up for simple and easy as possible but taste great when I cook. I used seasoned rice vinegar instead of plain rice vinegar which taste a lot better than what this recipe use plain rice vinegar to mix with cooked rice.",
