I found it easier to dice the raw potatoes and then boil them for a shorter period of time and I sliced the okra because the recipe didn't say what to do with it. I didn't use MSG. Update: I added vege broth to the leftovers and it made a really good soup that enabled the brightness of the tamarind paste to shine. As soup the amount of spice was just right.",
