Anyway...to mold...I lined a small plastic bowl with saran wrap and put the mixture in that...stuck it back in the fridge for a couple of hours....then carefully pressed it into the sesame seeds. It came out more like a \"round\" rather than a \"ball\". Good though!...OK...I made this again for a dinner party and they loved it....I used low fat cream cheese (just one 8 oz package)...3/4 can of shrimp...3/4 can of chopped water chestnuts...and 1 -teaspoon of this ready to use (and very potent) wasabi paste...let that stay in fridge overnight....then roll it in the toasted sesame seeds when you're reasy to serve....stays in a ball shape just fine.",
