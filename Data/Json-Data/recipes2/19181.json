I used a little over a pound sliced very thin for the mashed potatoes I added some sour creamand a few minced cloves of garlic sauteed in a couple tablespoons of butter. I had to leave casserole warming in the oven for about a half hour after baking it and the cheese formed a very nice crust (I used a little over a cup so it covered the mashed potatoes completely). Overall a bit starchy but fine for a cold weather meal and very tasty with a bit of A1 Sauce on it.",
