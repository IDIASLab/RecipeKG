So I used every thing it said then added my cream corn which included heavy cream and parmesan cheese. I think this made them ten times better. I also used strawberry preserve and cream cheese instead of the raspberry cuz its what I had and the boyfriend likes strawberry better. Having said that my whole family ate them up. Its a quick and very tasty treat. I really like the dip on the side never used a sweet dip with corn fritters before but I wont eat them any other way now.",

Also I thought that amount of mayo would make too much sauce for us so I used 3 tbsps. raspberry preserves and about 2/3 cup mayo (I just eyeballed it and mixed it together w/o heating it up)) and that was the perfect amount for us. These sort of reminded me of funnel cakes (but with corn of course lol) I could see maybe adding some sugar to the batter or just sprinkling them w/ some powdered sugar. I will def be making these again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
