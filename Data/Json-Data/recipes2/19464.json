I did not have dry red wine but did have some Mogen David Concord Grape wine cooked them to reduce the wine and make a glaze.Also omited the olives as I don't care for them. They turned out fantastic. Served them with a baked potato peas and 3 bean salad.Thanks Va for a wonderful recipe. They will be on my regular rotation.",
