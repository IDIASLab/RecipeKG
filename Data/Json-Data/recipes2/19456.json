You really have to experiment with how much of each item you like. The first time I didn't put enough meat and the second time maybe too much. We sealed the burrito up withs some cream cheese and that gave it such a nice flavor with the strawberry salsa I think I'd just use that next time instead of the blue cheese. We also ended up a lot of extra salsa which we are going to try to save for salads tomorrow for lunch but I'm thinking it will be soggy and slimey by they...we'll see. All and all I think this is a very well thought out lunch/dinner that just falls a little short but I do think it's a great way to start experimenting with these flavors maybe adding them to other favorites.",
