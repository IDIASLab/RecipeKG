                "reviewBody": "The key to keeping this recipe from being \"too greesy\" is to not over cook it. Anytime a cheese/mayo/sour cream/whatever dip has greese floating on the top it's because it was over cooked and has \"seperated\". Every oven is different so cook just until the cheese has melted and then take it out and let the cheese continue to melt from the heat that the baking dish and the contents are providing. Once it is over cooked and has seperated you can't mix the greese back in. You have to eat it like that or throw it out like one reviewer did twice. I also would take the advice of another reviewer and use a lighter mayonaise or artichokes packed in water but if you keep a close eye on the dip it shouldn't come out greesy like some of the complaints have said. Thanks for a great recipe. P.S. use fresh garlic for more of a kick.",

I noticed that it didn't get oily on top like I've seen other dips get and the consistency was very creamy. It was even great reheated the next day. I'm sure you could even substitute reduced-fat soup and have the same effect. It was great.",
