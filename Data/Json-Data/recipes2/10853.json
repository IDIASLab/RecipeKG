The other change is that I chose not to blister my tomatoes on the grill but kept them raw out of personal preference. This turned out really good. I didn't expect to like the peaches in this but they worked nicely. I do however recommend to use firm ones and not ones that are overly ripe. The one thing I would have preferred was less noodles more dressing and more hot sauce (use Sriracha) but that is an easy fix for next time. I might even add some bean sprouts to the mix and add chopped peanuts as a garnish. This right here is what I consider a PERFECT summer time meal! Thanks for sharing!",
