Wish I could have found more authentic sausages but found Aidell's garlic and gruyere which seemed fine. Great company dinner as it is hands off towards the end. I added a bit of garlic to the duck fat/cracklings to add to the bread crumb mixture. After simmering the bacon in the stock I removed it and did not add to the dish as all flavor had been cooked out. Had extra duck stock and pork stock from the freezer to add to the bean cooking liquid. Can't go wrong with extra flavor. Not too salty at all.",

Substituted browned boneless chicken thigh chunks for duck confit (sadly) but used the bones from chicken and pork chop in the cooking broth. The crumb topping is amazing but baking the cassoulet uncovered left mine a bit on the dry side despite ladling in more liquid at the halfway point. (I did halve the recipe so mine wasn't as deep). Next time I might cover for the first half of baking then uncover to finish because the carmelization of the crust is just sensational. Thank you again Chef John!",

I doubled the recipe and served it to 12 friends (who don t mind being my test subjects for new recipes) and it was a huge hit. I made the recipe pretty much as it was written. I did borrow a few ideas from a recipe provided by Dartagnan I made the confit of duck legs per a recipe from Dartagnan. They were fantastic plus the process provided me with an abundance of duck fat to be saved and used for other purposes. I used Tarbais beans (which were so creamy and delicious). When I cooked the beans in addition to the seasonings pork butt and pancetta I added the duck leg bones. Grab every little bit of flavor where you can right. That recipe had me put the pork butt and pancetta in with the beans. The meat was distributed well throughout the dish. The dinner was on a Friday evening so I started the recipe early (Sunday for the duck legs Tuesday for the beans and ragu Wednesday to construct the cassoulet). I do think the additional time to let the flavors meld was a positive with the flavor of the dish. In addition it gave me a good opportunity to skim off any fat that collected on the top of the dish. The crumb topping was great. I did use the duck skin to make duck bacon bits created by crisping it. OMG what a pop of flavor. I think the recipe is absolutely great as is. I will make it",

                "reviewBody": "We went to the south of France this summer and when we tried the cassoulet I knew I had to make it at home. I'm so glad I tried chef John's version because it was AMAZING. The only substitution I had to use was turkey legs in place of the duck confit as I could not find duck legs anywhere. I made the turkey confit using duck fat and it turned out really well so if you can't find duck try the turkey. Be sure to follow the steps closely and monitor the salt levels as you go. This took me a long time to make the first time but I anticipate a shorter prep time next time since I won't have to read the recipe and steps so many times! Make this if you're up for a challenge! Bon app\u00e9tit!",
