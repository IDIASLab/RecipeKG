As I was making them I became concerned about the protein to goodie ratio, so i decided to double the protein powder and add 1/4 c water to soften it. Then after pressing in a square pan I let them set in the freezer 5 hours, which gave them a nice shape when cut. Soft, chewy, delicious candy bars. Yielded 6 bars, 15g protein each, probably a ton of calories, but very yummy. I'll definitely make them again, but I'll cut back on the honey and chocolate chips.",
