        "description": "I just got back to my house in the countryside of Italy and, as always when I am here, I went to stock up on organic produce at the amazing organic farm right next to my town. I wish you could visit one day and witness how cool that it: acres and acres of organic veggies and fruits that are sold at a lower price than you can find in any grocery store for non-organic produce. We got 3 cardboard boxes full of amazing food for 30 euros. Stoked! Thanks to the cheap and easy availability of fresh and organic food, my days here are filled with yummy raw salads, fruit and delicious baked veggies.",
