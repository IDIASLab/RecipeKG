I giggled when I read the \"you can add some sausage back in\" instructions because I always make this with at LEAST half a pound of sausage in the gravy. Chunky is better! I know some recipes call for sage sausage and even though I have a love affair with maple sausage I wouldn't use anything but plain for gravy. Just too darn good to mess around with it! If you're looking for a biscuit recipe to go with try Mom's Baking Powder Biscuits here. Not fancy just delicious and easy. Enjoy!",
