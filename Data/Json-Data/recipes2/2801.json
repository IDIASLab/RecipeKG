But a good macaroni and cheese can't just depend on the Velveeta.  So...this was off to a good start but I made a couple of observations.  First, the flour isn't necessary.  At all.  In fact, I found I needed more milk just to overcome the thickness the flour was responsible for.  Second, this needed some cheesiness, and in the sauce, not just sprinkled on top.  A good spoonful of King Arthur Flour's Vermont Cheddar Cheese Powder fixed that right up.  (Love that stuff) Finally, and subjective perhaps, but I'm just not a fan of crushed Ritz crackers on my mac and cheese.  I crushed up some good bakery croutons and used them for the topping instead. Once I monkeyed around with this it was to die for - creamy, smooth, full of cheesy flavor and a topping with a slight buttery crunch.  Five stars with the above-mentioned modifications, but rather mediocre as is.",

I used 6 spoonfuls of butter, increased the milk by 1/4 of a cup, and finally increased the Velveeta by 4oz (or a 1/4). I then added hot sauce, ground mustard, pepper, and salt. (first time I made this) I added bacon and sharp cheddar cheese. Topped it off with crushed french onions (because I NEVER have Ritz). (Second time I made this) I included Jalapenos, mushrooms, onions, bacon, and diced ham. They both were amazing, but my husband prefers all the stuff in it. VERY VERY creamy and cheesy!!! I give it 4 stars because I tweaked it and felt it was better because I did :)",
