I double the cinnamon and nutmeg and use 1/3 cup minced fresh ginger. I prefer it with 1 cup pecans but will use walnuts in a pinch. This comes out super gingery which is what I prefer to sprinkle on my greek yoghurt and chopped pears. Might be overwhelming to eat as cereal, though. If you are a ginger-holic like me you will love it!",

I baked this for 20 minutes and found the texture exactly the way I like it. I ve tried a number of granolas on this site and this ranks right up there with the best of them maybe even is the best recipe. Although very tasty the cranberries baked up hard and dried out and I was expecting more ginger flavor (could be just a matter of personal taste preference here). Next time I may just eliminate the cranberries or try mixing them into the granola after the first ten minutes of baking since I do like that little bit of sweetness. Enjoyed today on a morning yogurt parfait with fresh fruit. Thanks for a great new granola recipe.",
