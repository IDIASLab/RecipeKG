The flavors mesh very well and you will not have to add salt as the olives already adds a \"saltiness\" to it. I did decide to add 2 tsp of the Red Wine Vinegar instead of one and just a \"smidgen\" more of the olive oil. It was absolutely scrumptious. This will definitely be my next dish at the Church Pot Luck.",
