If you have a small army to feed, you may add a few potatoes and stalks of celery.  I have never done that even when serving for several teenage boys!!  This soup freezes well.",

I had dried navy beans and fresh turnip greens on hand so I used them rather than the canned and frozen varieties. I soaked and cooked the beans first and then followed the recipe. For the greens I first chopped them before adding them to the soup--I used a gallon zip bag full and could have used more. I served the soup with homemade cucumber squash and beet pickles and a pan of cornbread--a great fall lunch or supper!",

I needed liquid so I added a pint of homemade chicken stock. I couldn't find turnip greens either fresh or frozen so I used some beautiful fresh beet greens. I realize these are significant changes but I feel one of the things that makes a good recipe is flexibility. It may not be the traditional Cuban dish but it sure tasted good. I look forward to making it again when I locate turnip greens. Thanks for sharing.",

To make this soup thin and look like the picture I added two cups chicken stock and one cup water. Also a \"Navy Bean\" is a small white bean smaller than a Great Northern. So you are looking for cans of small white beans (they may not be labeled \"Navy\"). Lastly frozen turnip greens are hard to come by in some western states. However fresh turnip greens and turnips are probably available. I used two bunches of fresh turnip greens stems removed and one small turnip cubed with very good results. \"Pepper vinegar\" is hot sauce. I served this soup to my guests with several different bottled hot sauces so everyone could select their favorite brand of heat.",
