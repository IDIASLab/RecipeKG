I will probably make this again and I will take the suggestion to serve it over steamed rice and perhaps with tortilla chips. The dish was somewhat soupy as a previous reviewer complained but I'm sure that rice will nicely soak it up making it very tasty too. Also I used cubed chicken; next time I will try to take the time to shred it instead; I think that will give the chicken more surface area to absorb the other flavors. I also appreciated that this was a quick dish to make.",
