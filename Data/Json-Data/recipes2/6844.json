I omitted the carrots (didn't have any on hand) and added in sliced mushrooms, red pepper and a little fresh spinach that I had to use up along w/ the spinach and tomatoes. I used more than 1 clove of garlic, and just eyeballed the cheese until the sauce was the thickness that I wanted. The whole family gobbled this up! This is a great recipe to make when you have a lot of odd and end veggies in the fridge that need used up. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",
