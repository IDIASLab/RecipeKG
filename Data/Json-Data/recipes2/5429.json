The recipe has some great ingredients but I made some modifications that I think improved the final product.  I sauteed the chicken in some olive oil and then simmered with the veggies and chicken broth for about 15 min.  I combined the chicken, veggies and broth with the rice  and soup mixture and only cooked it for 45 min (covered).  Added cheese and cooked uncovered for 10 more minutes.  Based on one other reviewers comments, I decreased the amount of chicken broth to 1 and 3/4 cup and added an extra half cup of brown rice.  I did not want a soupy mixture and these changes made the perfect casserole combination.",

I made a few changes (because I can't seem to just follow a recipe as is): I added 2 cans of low sodium chicken broth and an extra cup of brown rice. I also threw in a Tbsp of minced garlic as I cooked the chicken. I was impatient and didn't want to wait the hour and a half for this to bake so I added some of the broth and the veggies to the skillet with my chicken to heat everything up and start cooking. I also let the rice soak with the soup and broth while I was cooking the chicken. I added a Tbsp of cream cheese as well to make it a little bit more creamy. Baked it in a 10x14 and plan to eat the leftovers for lunch this week.",
