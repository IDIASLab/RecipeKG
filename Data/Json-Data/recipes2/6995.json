                "reviewBody": "These are very easy to assemble with few ingredients, making for an impressive looking side dish.  At first I thought there's no way there will be enough \"stuffing\". And there really wasn't much, but I later realized that the amount was perfect. Any more and the mushrooms would have been totally overwhelmed by pesto flavor. I did have a couple issues with the directions though. First, I don't see the need to lightly oil the grate of your grill, since you'll be using a grill pan anyway. In step 4 it says to brush the olive oil mixture over the top of each mushroom, yet there is no mention of any olive oil mixture in the ingredients. What to do? I ended up lightly brushing the mushrooms with some flavored olive oil I had.  Next, the directions say to place the mushrooms TOP side UP in the grill pan and then to fill each one with the stuffing. I'm assuming this should say top side DOWN.  Aside from a few unclear steps, these turned out very tasty and I will definitely make them again. The only addition I felt these needed were a sprinkle of salt. I would salt the inside of each cap lightly before stuffing them next time. I served these with pork tenderloin and a fresh garden salad. Thanks for the delicious recipe darklordlarry!",
