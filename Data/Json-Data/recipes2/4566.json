I have always had trouble \"double dipping\" and I struggled getting the 2nd coat to stick to the beans here too but enough did and the seasoned crumbs made all the difference in the world in terms of flavor. The green beans were fresh from my garden which is always a bonus. One tip I learned is to ditch the two bowls for the flour and breadcrumb and use gallon size ziplock bags instead. Not only is it less messy but the beans coat so much better and clean up is a breeze. Drop them in, zip, shake, and you are done.",

I substituted Panko bread crumbs for the regular crumbs called for in the recipe but wouldn't advise it. The Panko crumbs are too coarse for the delicate texture of the green beans. Also be cognizent that these beans fry up super quickly so don't walk away from them. Thank you for a great recipe!",
