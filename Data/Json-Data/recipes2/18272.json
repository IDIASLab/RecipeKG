Had some canned diced tomatoes. I didn't have Italian dressing but I did have great extra-virgin olive oil balsamic vinegar basil oregano Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Magic Emeril's Essence and sea salt flakes with rosemary. Plus black peppercorns which I toasted in a skillet and then ground with a mortar and pestle. And some garlic. Defrosted the chicken using the defrost setting on the microwave. I then marinated the chicken in the mixture above (minus the pepper and garlic). Maybe 20 minutes? Sauteed the garlic for a minute then threw in the chicken but without cutting it up. Was making the rigatoni on the side (don't ever forget....LOTS of salt for the boiling pasta water!). Close to when I thought the chicken was done I took it out and THEN rough-chopped it. Then back in the skillet. Drained the pasta and tossed it with the freshly ground toasted black pepper. Then tossed it all with the chicken and some parmesan cheese (I'd rather do something like pecorino romano but for a quickie the parm did the trick). It came out tender as heck and SUPER-flavorful. Spouse loved it and was raving. So was I.",
