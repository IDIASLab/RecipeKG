It is usually not a bright green color. It is more of a dark color. Take my advice!!",

The bitterness is gone and it is delicious. So nice to have a new healthy veg; I now cook it at least once a week. I also used this method with Broccolini and it too helps eliminate the bitterness. I am looking forward to trying this method with Chinese Broccoli from the Asian Market as that too is so bitter and very very similar to rabe. THANK YOU!",

The recipe submitted is basic but can be enhanced this way. Trim the ends of the stems. Bring a large pot or saucepan filled with salted water to a boil. Immerse the BR and cook for no more than 8 minutes. Drain immediately, flash chill and then spread on cookie sheet to continue cool down. The BR will be bright green yet tender. Cut the BR into bite size pieces. Saute some garlic to taste and a few hot pepper flakes in olive oil - about 3 tbsp. should do it. Then add BR, toss to coat and remove from heat when warmed through; you don't want to lose that beautiful bright green color. Place on a serving plate, top with a squirt of lemon juice and maybe some homemade toasted breadcrumbs. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and enjoy.",

The boiling seems to remove much of the bitterness from the broccoli rabe, although there's enough bite left that it still tastes like broccoli rabe should taste!  However, although the flavor was great, the texture got just a little mushier than I'd like.  Also, mine came out a little oily and I would cut down on the oil next time.  That said, I really liked this recipe and I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sending it in!",
