I never actually have mayo - I only have Miracle Whip Light in the fridge so that's what I used.  And taking the advice from some others, I used 1 cup of Miracle Whip Light and 1 cup of light sour cream.  I also used Lite Velveeta Cheese & the potatoes still tasted very rich and yummy even using all light ingredients.  I stirred the bacon bits in with everything else instead of putting them on top & added some dried chives instead of the chopped onion.  I combined some crushed cornflakes and melted butter and sprinkled it on top before baking.  For some reason, my kids will eat anything with a crunchy topping!  I did bake the dish covered for the first half hour so the cornflakes didn't get too brown.  Everyone loved this dish.  In fact the kids like to call it Potato Skin Casserole because they said it tastes just like potato skins - but so much easier for me to make!!",

I would recommend a few changes:\r\ninstead of the bottled bacon bits, cook up about 12 pieces of bacon and cut them up in small pieces.  Also, I used 1 cup each of mayonnaise / sour cream and 3/4 brick of Velveeta rather than 1lb.  One other suggestions, use the southern style hash browns rather than the shredded.  It makes mixing a lot easier.  Try this recipe with these few changes and you won't be sorry!!!!",

I cut this in half for our family of four--it worked beautifully. I baked it in a 1.5 quart round casserole and baked for approx. 35 mins. I'd highly recommend giving this a try!",

My mother-in-law took the recipe home with her. Out of 10 people we almost ate the whole casserole. One thing I did do was what another reviewer suggested. I substituted 1 cup lite sour cream and used 1 cup lite mayo. I also used lite velveeta and didn't used all of the bacon bits it called for. It's a keeper!!! Thank you.",
