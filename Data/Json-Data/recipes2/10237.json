                "reviewBody": "Closest to authentic I've found, even has the actual  darker  more genuine color than the usual bright red restaurant versions.  I do add (4) 1/4\" thick fresh ginger coins, smashed and chopped, to the sauce before cooking.  I've even had to make it without the Hoisin sauce (none on hand, and no black bean sauce to make any) , and it still came out great.\n\nYou can also use \"country style pork ribs\" for this - they're nothing more than pork butt (shoulder) cut in ~2 square strips.\n\nFor leaner diets, use a pork tenderloin or thick cut boneless pork chops, taking an extra step to brine them before marinading, to keep them moist and juicy.  Also, I find that the soy sauce adds enough salt, you don't need the kosher salt at the end (especially if you've brined the pork first).\n\nFor those who don't want (or can't) use a grill for this [I only have a pellet smoker/grill at home, and don't want the smoke flavor], you can still do this quite well in the oven.  To do so, simply use a sheet pan lined with foil or parchment, and lay them out on a lightly greased rack - cooking oil spray is great for this.  Bake at 275\u00ba for 2 hours, basting them every 20 minutes with the sauce (6 times), and turning them every other baste (3 times).  Be sure to get the sides when basting.\n\nThey will cook better, without the bottoms getting soggy (even with turning), if you raise the rack off of the sheet pan by about 2\", either using small drinking glasses or similar, or racks with fold-out legs.

I made my marinade with oyster sauce (which is slightly sweeter)  instead of hoisin because I never have hoisin on hand. I did not use dye, and I put about half a cup of sauce to side. With the rest I marinated 3 lbs of country ribs for 24 hours. I baked this at 325 for 2 hours then used the remaining sauce to glaze it every 20 minutes or so until it reached 170. Next time I would put aside more sauce because it was pretty delicious. My kids and I snacked on this plain and kept going back for more. With what we had left I made fried rice and they raved about it. I would definitely do this again. As a Chinese person who grew up on bbq pork, I was very pleased with this. The only changes I might make is to very slightly dial back the 5 spice and  for my personal tastes make it slightly sweeter. Thank you, Chef John! You did great!",
