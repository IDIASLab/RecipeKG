I was not disappointed:-) One thing about turmeric is that the amount used in prepared mustards barely affects the mustard flavor but rather is used for its yellow color; it's the color of the seed used that affects the flavor so just use your favorite prepared mustard. My favorite is Grey Poupon Dijon so that is what I used. If you want more 'heat' then my all means use English mustard called for in this recipe or mix Colman's powder with equal amounts of water but add it to taste because Colman's is 'very' hot;-)",
