I replaced the coconut milk with an equal amount of additional creme; and the result was actually a much better sauce. Additionally I increased the amount of Garam Masala used for dusting the Salmon Filets; next time I'll add a little bit of flour to make a crust on them.

I didn't change anything, it was delicious as is.  When I served this to my boyfriend he said it looked truly gourmet and after he ate it he said it is one of the best dishes he's ever eaten (I've cooked hundreds of meals for him and he's never said that before).  I served it with boiled new potatoes and sauteed green beans and poured the sauce over everything.  Also the sauce seems versatile, I believe it could be used with other fishes and even chicken, pork or lamb.  Thank you Ryan!",

I was only able to save the sauce by using a couple teaspoons of white sugar. After that we enjoyed it on the salmon but I'm not sure we'll make this again.
