I had leftover meatloaf from \"Cottage Meatloaf\" from this site and since I was down to my last slice I thought I'd give this recipe a try and I'm glad I did. I typically have my meatloaf sandwich cold so this was a nice change of pace. I used thick cut white bread and opted for a mayo vs. mustard. I left the cheese off the outside of the bread as I thought that as a bit of cheese \"overkill\". It went great with a side of kettle cooked chips and a dill pickle. If you love meatloaf and you love grilled cheese this recipes is a definite must try!",
