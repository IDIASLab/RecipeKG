I prefer my sauces without flour and just cooked the sauce down to the proper consistency. I also added a splash of dry sherry as we really like that flavor in our mushroom sauces. We did the steak on the grill (along with another steak we had done asian style) and it turned out fantastic.",

The recipe lists ingredients of heavy whipping cream and chives, but nowhere in the instructions did it state how and where to use these items as of 25 March.   I'm not the savviest in the kitchen, so I added the heavy whipping cream to the sauce shortly after adding the butter/flour mixture and simmered and stirred for about 5 minutes.   This seemed to work well.  The sauce thickened and the flavor increased.   We all had seconds!",
