I'd set out an assortment of toppings including ricotta cheese broccoli fresh spinach leaves pepperoni crumbled bacon you get the idea - whatever I had in the fridge or freezer. The friends would take courage from the selections my kids would make since they were old pros at this and since they were the creators usually picky eaters would actually eat these fun lunches. The parents loved the ideas and many called to thank me! Try it on your own fussy eaters. The trick is to make the oven hot - 400 or 450; they take only a few minutes to cook and the pita won't dry out.",

I made the Easy Pizza Sauce III recipe from this site & we had dinner on the table in just minutes. Thanks for the fun, fast, & tasty recipe! :)",

Finally my daughter lamented about the taste of the cheese while my nagging wife went off about the pineapple.:( i told them to cook for themselves next time!
