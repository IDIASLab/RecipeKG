Also next time I'll either drop the oven temp down or keep it in for less time since the steak was a bit too done. I served it with grilled corn and a summer arugula salad with strawberries feta and honey balsamic dressing for a perfect dinner. I'm definitely going to use this recipe again!",

Hubs said the truffle butter did. What we both agreed on was the steak. If at all possible grill it. We prefer that and that is what we did with this. We still got it a little over done but it was still tender as all get out. That is the beauty of ribeye. Regardless of how you prepare your steak the combo of all 3 components is money. 5 stars all the way!",
