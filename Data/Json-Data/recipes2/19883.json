I've been looking for a lower-fat pesto and this recipe definitely fits the bill. I found that I didn't need quite as much broth as was called for and I did end up adding about 1/2 T. olive oil to make it a bit creamier. Also use a low-sodium broth. For those who love the taste of pesto but want to avoid some of the fat--this recipe is the way to go!",
