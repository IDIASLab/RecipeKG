Once your sugar mixture has turned a nice caramel color you have to immediately turn off the heat, add baking soda (be careful), add the seeds (be careful), and mix until combined. As the concoction cools it hardens quickly, so transfer into your pan and press as soon as you can (be careful).",

It stuck to the top so I will try spraying the candy on top with oil next time. The baking soda does cause it to bubble up quite a bit so a big pot is better! I found my candy thermometer to be very helpful especially because I had the burner up too high so it the sugar mixture was done in five minutes.",
