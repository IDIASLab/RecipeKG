I poured the batter on then sprinkled the chips over the pancake and they were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS best pancakes I've ever had. Not traditional at all but very good. The brown sugar seemed to crystalize around the oats making them have a nice little crunch inside of the gooey chocolatey pancake. Kind of like a melted Nestle crunch bar.",

I had to change quite a bit because of what I had on hand and the fact that I was cooking for a wheat egg and soy allergy. I used the whole oats as specified in the recipe. I didn't have any flax so I ground more oats and used that in place of the flax. I also couldn't use wheat flour so I used brown rice flour in place of the pastry flour. I then used a scant cup of 2% milk mixed with a scant 1/2 cup of fresh whipping cream in place of the soy milk. I made them small because of some of the comments about not cooking well - I had no problem - they cooked up beautiful! I served them with my homemade banana topping and fresh whipped cream - yummmm! Next time I will try half the amount of salt because I thought they were quite salty.",
