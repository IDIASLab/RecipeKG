Even if a faux-bordelaise isn't your cup of tea, you can always save the scraps for a Sunday sauce or meatballs. The overnight 'dry-aging' step is optional, but does add a little something extra to the final product.",

As Chef John mentions use sodium free or homemade broth if possible I used reduced sodium and thought it seemed a bit salty. I used half the pan sauce added more red wine reduced it in the saut\u00e9 pan added the butter and it was delicious. I would definitely make this again! Thank you!",

He enjoyed the sauce as we all did. Only changes made were that we like our meet well done so I cooked it on both sides double time. Had no chicken broth so I used a chicken knorr cube (bouillon) & water Moscato instead of red wine as well as white onions instead of shallots. EVERYTHING still came out FABULOUS & DELICOUS!!! Wonderful recipe & very versatile. Even with substitutions it was perfect! Will definitely do again! Thanks:)",

The steaks were just cooked perfectly; I finished by putting them in the oven for 10 minutes to receive a medium to medium-well done steaks. I used cooking red wine and I didn't have anymore Chicken stock or broth so I 1 used chicken bouillon cube to 1 cup of water (which makes chicken stock) and just used 1/2 cup of cooking wine with 1/2 cup of chicken stock for the sauce.",
