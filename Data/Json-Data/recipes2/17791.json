First, I simply fried the potatoes just like fries and then after taking them out of the oil, I sprinkled them w/the garlic salt and ranch mixture.  Then, I did my second batch exactly as the recipe stated. Both ways came out good. The 2nd way did dirty my oil up pretty fast...as another reviewer mentioned. (ok ok i recycle my oil :-))  I liked the flavor of the fries better when I added it at the very end. Both ways are good though!!! Didn't last on the table. ",
