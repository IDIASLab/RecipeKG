I did use pesto (Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto from this site) & it added such freshness & flavor....next tiem I will double the pesto. I minced my onions up real small because while I wanted the flavor I didn't want chunks. After it was done & plated I squeezed some lemon juice on it & sprinkled it w/ some black pepper & I liked that so well that I hit it w/ some lemon pepper. What a healthy flavorful & easy way to stretch leftover salmon!",
