This is usually done with heavy cream, but I like to use coconut milk instead; the subtle sweetness it provides works beautifully with the spices in the dish. Serve with steamed rice.",

So I reduced the tomato paste to one tablespoon and the crushed tomatoes to 3/4 cup.\n\nI blended the spices and checked the aroma.  I felt something was missing so I added between 1/4 and 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves a bit at a time.  That improved the aroma and ultimately the taste.  \n\nEveryone loved the chicken tikka masala.  We often visit a local Indian restaurant and they almost always include chicken tikka masala in the buffet.  My husband says the chicken masala I prepared is as good, if not better than, the restaurant version.\n\nI have always thought that mushrooms should be included and the next time I make chicken tikka masala, I'll use mushrooms in addition to the chicken.\n\nThank you Chef John.",

I didn't have any ginger or cardamom, so I didn't use it, and I used regular butter, but besides that, I followed everything else correctly. The tomatoes and coconut milk have a great flavor together. The boneless skinless chicken thighs work so well with this. It was quick and not complicated. Also, I somehow made way more sauce than Chef John does in the video, but I'm not complaining about that! One of best meals I've made in a long time. Thanks Chef John.",

Maybe the sweetness of the parsnips complemented/counteracted the salty of the spice... and the coconut no longer seems too coconut-y. Everything married nicely with nothing overpowering anything else. Very yummy. I've only had Tikka Masala at an Indian restaurant once in my life so I'm no connoisseur. That said my reaction to Chef John's interpretation as prepared in my kitchen is \"I don't love it. I don't hate it.\" What's keeping me from loving it I think is the salt. Whoo! Much too much salt for my palate. Other than that the flavor is pretty good... though it doesn't have that I-don't-know-what I experienced at the Indian restaurant that sense of \"this isn't knocking my socks off but I really REALLY would enjoy another bite.\" Perhaps someone with more experience with Indian (or British?) cooking could identify what might be 'off' with this recipe or maybe there's nothing 'off' and it's just me... I don't know. I probably will give this recipe another try either eliminating or significantly reducing the salt. For me that'll be a step in the right direction.",

I was mainly interested in this recipe because it's essentially paleo and whole30 compliant, if you don't serve it over rice. It really is good, but it's a really high-maintenance dish that essentially ties you to the stove for an hour. I'm wondering if I can get this to work in a slow-cooker... Possible I'll revisit this and bump it up to a full five stars if it really is significantly better the next day (I'm kinda thinking it will be). Lot of work to put this together, though...",
