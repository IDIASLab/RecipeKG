The burger consists of: Grilled chicken fillet, grilled bacon, lettuce and tomato on a toasted foccacia bun, with herbed mayo on the base and guacamole on the crown. The burger got its name due to the strange range of ingredients. They taste fantastic, however you may need a few napkins to clean up afterwards, depending on the amount of guacamole.",

My advice is to serve the sandwhich sliced in to two servings and be prepared with the napkins. It is juicy and a challenge to keep together but oh so well worth the effort. I substituted a spicy guacamole dip in lieu of making my fresh spicy version one time with success. Give this recipe a try you won't be disappointed!
