I go a step further and make a vanilla wafer crust in a 9x13 pan. I then double the ingredients and add a little lemon juice and lemon zest to the filling. I top it all with Cool Whip and line the outer rim with vanilla wafers. I also add a little lemon zest over the top for color and extra flavor. Everyone that has tasted this has never complained that it\u2019s too sour or tart and I make it often for potlucks and holiday gatherings. It\u2019s also a beautiful pie. It doesn\u2019t last long either. I don\u2019t know which lemonade mix the other user used that gave this pie \u201c1\u201d star, but I use Country Time lemonade mix. My sister can\u2019t even believe this pie is that good, remembering how good our mom\u2019s was.",
