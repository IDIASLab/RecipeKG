Next time I will get slightly bigger rolls and/or smaller eggs; it was a bit of a challenge to get the whole egg to sit nicely in the roll on top of bacon and cheese.  Perhaps putting the egg in the roll first and then adding the bacon and cheese halfway through cooking might help.  Crusty rolls need a sharp, serrated type steak knife.   I'll be making it again!",

I baked for 25 mins and then 5 mins more for the bun tops but the bottoms burned a little and the egg yolk started to set. 15-20 minutes and then 5 more mins with the bun tops would be better.",
