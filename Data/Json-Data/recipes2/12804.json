But the taste surprised!\" I tend to only use processed Velveeta in \"The Stuff\", y'know, the elusive cheese dip that everybody makes that goes by many a name that sometimes has browned meat, sausage, Rotel, or peppers in it? So making this recipe was out of the norm for me, but ultimately a major dinner win! I halved the recipe, and the only changes that I made were fresh mushrooms (sweated w/ the onions and bell peppers), used a large can of Kirkland chicken, and didn't bother to stir the Velveeta to melt b4 putting in the oven, as I put this together in the morning, and popped it in the oven at dinnertime. 45 min. at 350 deg. was fine for mine, as it was coming out of the fridge, but I think the cheese and pasta would scorch a bit (unless covered) if baked as directed for that long. My only complaint was the difficult of twirling a spaghetti noodle, but also being able to stabby-stab all the good veggies and flavors also in it, so I'd make it again w/ elbows or rotini.",
