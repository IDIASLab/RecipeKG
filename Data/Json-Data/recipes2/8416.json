Agree with other reviewers to use a basting brush \notherwise the cod fillets were to cold and made the butter herb mixture freeze up and made it hard to coat fish.  Also noticed that it was a little bland.  Seems like it needed salt.\nOtherwise flavor was mild but good.  I would just up the herbs more and add a dash of salt.  (I didn't have any seasoned salt) so didn't use any salt.  Probably why my fish was a little bland.   Also helps to ensure the fish fillets are all uniform size so they all cook at the same rate!",
