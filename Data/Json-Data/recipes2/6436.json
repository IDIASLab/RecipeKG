Boy, once I mixed all the ingredients and poured it over the ice, it was ready to go.  I enjoyed it so much that I took it to the work potluck.  My co=workers could not believe this was chia pudding.  It was a hit!",

I pureed the milk and strawberries first then added in the rest of the ingredients and gave the blender a quick pulse. After refrigerating for about an hour I gave the pudding a quick stir to prevent clumping. It set up nicely. I made it in the evening for the following day's breakfast. The only slight deviation from the recipe was to use coconut/almond milk blend. Very tasty and healthy.",

Perfect for grabbing quickly in the morning on my way out the door.  May have to stir a bit when you open and eat.",

I didn't add the honey or vanilla because I used the sweetened vanilla almond milk I had on hand. Love to have a bit for breakfast! It's important to stir this a couple times in the first 30-45 minutes or the seeds will settle and you will have a thick base with liquid still sitting on the top. I like to make a big batch in the evening and let it sit over night, it will last a couple days.",
