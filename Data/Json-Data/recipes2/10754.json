He buzzed through the kitchen just as I was finishing up grabbed one little shrimp on his way and I said \"Wait is it any good?\" He replied \"Hell yeah! I mean yes!\" After he finally got a whole huge bowl he asked if there was still some left because he was going to want more the next day. A new favorite at our house. I made it exactly as described in the recipe except I didnt measure the lime juice or cilantro. I just juiced 2 limes (they were'nt super juicy so it was probably about right) and chopped what looked like enough cilantro. Served over a frozen bag of southwestern rice popped in the microwave. So happy to have a super easy meal that tastes like so much more.",
