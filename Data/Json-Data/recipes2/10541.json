I made two of these and mine was fabulous all by itself, but to my husband's I added a couple of strips of bacon to take it over the top (plus it was a good way to get my husband to give it a try)!

Andrea, these 5 stars are especially to counteract your strange review of anything you haven't tried, and S & P are a \"given\" for me. Any recipe on here is free to be tweaked as you wish, that's the beauty of the art of cooking, but it offends my sense of fairness to give anything the lowest rating if you didn't even try it. Reviews help me decide if I want to tweak it and how.",
