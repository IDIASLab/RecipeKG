I wonder if it was b/c I had just also finished cooking the quinoa and yam (I like yams better) and they were both still pretty warm. Maybe if I let them cool I'd have better luck. Will try again b/c I like the overall recipe. I would also use more sea salt and thyme next time as this batch was a little bland.",
