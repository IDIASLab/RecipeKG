These birds would have been totally burned up and overcooked at 50 minutes @ 450\u00baF, and that\u2019s not even allowing for the additional time for the sauce to be brushed on.  Secondly, although the sauce is tasty, this is waaaaaay too much sauce for two cornish hens.  I saved half the sauce, thickened it with a cornstarch slurry, served the sauce at the table with the hens, and I still had more sauce than I needed.  IMO this recipe has a few issues and needs some tweaking.  On the positive side, it\u2019s worth the effort because these little birds were tasty!  My review is based on the modifications I made to the recipe and how the hens turned out with the changes.",
