Cheese curds room temperature and preferably fresh from the day not refrigerated (squeaky factor is a must!). The BBQ sauce has to be thick we have poutine sauce back home (a mix between gravy and bbq sauce) Rule of thumb preparation: mix cheese curbs with the hot fries and poor the warm sauce on top of everything. Don't drown the fries. Some top it off with a handful of curds. Also consider serving in a bowl. This may sound crazy but hey! We invented Poutine in Qu\u00e9bec. Fun fact: McDonalds actually tried to add poutine on their Canadian menus in Eastern Canada / Quebec. No need to say they have failed miserably. Enjoy!",
