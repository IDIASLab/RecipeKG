I wouldn't change a thing, though because I forgot that the directions of recipes don't change when scaling, I mistakenly only used two cups of Parmesan cheese, instead of four cups (I doubled the recipe).  Honestly, I couldn't tell anything was wrong and didn't discover my error until after all was said and done.  Though in restrospect, the sauce was thinner than one might expect.  My discriminate wife rated this one a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10.  I would certainly agree.  It's a fabulous recipe.  I bought a more expensive brand of Parmesan cheese and grated it immediately before use, and I highly recommend doing that.  Spending a couple more bucks to get good cheese is definitely worth the investment.  I've tried and reviewed over 200 recipes at allrecipes, many of them very good, and this one is certainly in the top 10%.",

HOWEVER, I am surprised that no one has really commented that 5 cloves of garlic is a bit too much.  Don't get me wrong, we LOVE garlic, but 5 cloves???  We only used 3 cloves and it was still very strong.  I can't even imagine what 5 cloves would taste like!  Unless you want your sauce to be overpowered by the garlic, cut down to 2 or 3 cloves.  We also used regular whipping cream instead of heavy whipping cream and it turned out perfectly.  NOTE: For those of you who got a lumpy sauce, don't use the Kraft parmesan that is in the green can!  That stuff has been processed and will not melt correctly.  You must use the stuff that is in the refrigerated cheese section of your grocery store.  You can find them in wedges or preshredded bags, but it must be fresh.",
