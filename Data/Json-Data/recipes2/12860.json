We liked the batch without better, so we mixed the two batches up. I would make this again, but the next time I'm going to use popcorn puffs rather than real popcorn. It was fun and festive and we liked the crunch from the corn flakes.",

I used about 2 cups of Brach's Mellowcreme Autumn Mix in place of the malt balls. I still used the pretzel sticks. I saw that Hershey's had a White Chocolate Candy Corn M&M. Sadly despite the store telling me exactly which aisle they were in they were out of stock. Instead of those I picked out all of the yellow orange and brown pieces of Shareable Packs of Dark Peanut and Caramel M&M's. That came to right about 2 cups. I decided that the candy seemed to be too high of a proportion to the popcorn and pretzels so I added so more popcorn. I then added about 6 oz. more white chocolate. I omitted the malted milk because I wasn't using the malt balls. I tasted a couple of pieces that fell on the counter. Who wouldn't; right? I thought it tasted great. Bro takes it into work tomorrow. I'm sure they are going to love this version as much as they did the Easter version.",
