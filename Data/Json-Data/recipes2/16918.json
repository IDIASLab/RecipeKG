It was way too much liquid that wouldn't cook down. Finally I drained all the liquid out of the pan and kind of started over with the (canned) mushrooms. I sauted in half stick butter and added in more burgundy wine. The onion was still in the pan with the mushrooms and they did add a nice flavor. They turned out very good after my re-do. Sorry.. I dont know what went wrong here. Thanks though.",
