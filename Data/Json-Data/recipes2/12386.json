        "description": "As a child, I remember my grandparents having a smokehouse. In the dead of winter, when it was well below freezing, a hog would be slaughtered and no part of it wasted. The fresh hams were then covered in a dry salt mixture, wrapped, and hung up for several months to cure. To cook, they were sliced and pan fried, sometimes with a tiny bit of lard, in a hot, black iron skillet. Hot, usually breakfast, coffee was poured into the skillet to deglaze it, making red eye gravy. Redeye Gravy gets its name from the appearance of the gravy after the coffee sinks to the bottom. Serve over biscuits or grits.",

It did have a reddish tint to it when you dumped in the coffee but I think it was mostly from the bits that came off of the ham. That part sinks to the bottom of the pan when you are trying to dish it out and the butter takes over. It is thin and as I said hard to spoon out over the biscuits. The recipe didn't call for flour. Maybe it's not supposed to be in there but me and the hubs both agreed that thickening it up would have been better. The way it was you were just basically watering down and sogging up the biscuits. The flavor was good so I plan on trying this one again but I'm adding flour to the drippings next time.",

It doesn't taste like salty coffee; nothing like white or traditional gravy; a different kind of good. Thanks!",
