We thought the smoked turkey sausage tasted more like a frankfurter than what we consider smoked sausage and that was the biggest disappointment. We eat Hillshire Farm Chicken Hardwood Smoked Sausage which I think comes closer to what I consider traditional smoked sausage (that I just don't eat anymore). Don't really mean to bash Butterball but I just compared the nutritional info for these two brands and they're very very close. This all could be taste preference but I just didn't care for this sausage and it's unlikely I'll make this again.",

So I just cooked it the whole time in the pan flipping it once using a plate. I made a few changes for preference. When I was chopping the meat and green onion both seemed like a lot. So I cut them in half. I am not a fan of fresh basil so I just subbed two good sized pinches of dry basil. It was going to be cooked anyhow. After I got all of my ingredients out and started the recipe I realized I forgot the mozzarella cheese! No problem it still worked out just fine. It did have the parmesan cheese in it. I guess the only downside is it seemed kind of salty. Not sure if it was from the parmesan cheese sausage or both combined together. It would make a fine recipe though to recommend to someone looking for brunch recipes. I found it to be very filling.",

I also couldn't find the sun dried tomatoes in my grocery store so I just seeded and chopped up some fresh and squeezed them dry between paper towels. I've been told that the sun dried tomatoes really make this dish. Now here comes the tricky party. I mixed everything together and tossed it in the oven. Then I realized I was supposed to cook a little before doing that. Sigh Oh well. Turned out good if you don't mind waiting 1/2 hour - 45 minutes to eat breakfast. Even though this tasted good I really wasn't a fan of the texture and sodium content (as well as a few other ingredients) of the sausage. If I make this again I would leave out the sausage.",
