VERY TASTY! However, even with the increased meat, i feel it still could've used a little less mayo. I actually placed the seafood mix in a dish and into the oven to warm it up prior to stuffing the shells... Also, as suggested by another review, I lightly topped the shells with a warm parmesan sauce (bar of cream cheese, 1/2c parm cheese, 3/4c milk, dash of pepper & nutmeg- microwaved in a bowl for 7-8 min until creamy). This dish was a nice accent to our steamed zucchini... THANKS!",

I also put it in the oven for a few mins and my boyfriend make alfredo sauce from scratch which I poured over top of the shells and put back in the oven for about 10-15mins",

Because of the audience I was serving I flavored with old bay and added a little bit of hot sauce for a kick. The feedback I got was that everyone enjoyed it but next time would I please use jalapeno cheese - they all like spice.  I also think this would be a good summer lunch entre on a bed of greens.
