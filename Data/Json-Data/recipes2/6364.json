Just an FYI to anyone else -- this recipe divider program does not divide in half correctly. When you switch the serving size to 24 it gives you equal amounts of jalapenos and pickles instead of 2:1 as it should be. I'm sure they'll fix it at some point but for right now just be careful if you re-size this recipe or you could wind up wasting ingredients! Thanks for the recipe Christopholofigus! EDIT: Adding that my husband did eat this on watermelon slices! He doesn't like watermelon (but we eat it anyway for health benefits) so he had nothing to lose by trying -- but he DID like the watermelon better with this on it:) Just adding that for anyone who's curious about trying it that way!",

I made pretty close to as written w/the exception of using 1/2C less jalaps (my jar was only 12 oz I belatedly realized) and omitting the black pepper (I'm a freak who hates black pepper). I even measured everything since I'd have no reference point for a jalapeno relish (and since it has so few reviews). Awesome. Just awesome. I took it to a casual dinner party and we inhaled it both as is w/Scoops and atop grilled pork chops. I can't wait to try it on grilled burgers and dogs and to mix it w/some sour cream to cut the heat for sissies for a nice spread/dip. The possibilities are endless but you NEED to try this! Don't be intimidated at first bite; the heat hits you up front yet is gone before you have time to swallow. It's good stuff! THANKS for sharing Chrisopholofigus!",
