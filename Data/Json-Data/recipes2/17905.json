I always use good season's italian salad dressing mix and use balsamic for the vinegar part and olive oil for the oil part and drizzle over the inside of the bread instead of dipping. The added seasoning and the olive oil/balsamic give it such a great flavor. I have added a slice of provolone which adds wonderful flavor. I have added roasted red peppers instead of tomatoes and grilled chicken. I have also used all kinds of diff breads but we like the italian or harder crusted breads best. The original recipe and all the diff ways I make this are all 5 stars! You can't go wrong.",

Prepared tomato cheese and basil on a platter and drizzled with vinegar and left it marinate until I was ready to used it in about an hour. Great for summer lunch for guests!",

Some notes: - Cut the basil leaves not chop but whole leaves tend to pull right out with each bite. - I drizzled the oil and vinegar on the bread layered on the tomato basil and mozzarella then drizzled some more and then toasted lightly. - Next time I will lightly toast the bread first too! It's a perfect lunch for work I have everything pre-sliced in baggies in the fridge ready to be made in the toaster oven at work tomorrow!",
