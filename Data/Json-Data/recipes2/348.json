They were in the vegetable aisle in a package. The \"schmear\" is a great flavor and can be used on anything. And I used smoked salmon. Take it from an appetizer queen, these are really good and different. However, you will need a boatload of breath mints afterwards. :)  Totally worth it. One more note, the recipe calls for 40 pieces. Not sure 5oz. of salmon/lox covers that. It might get a bit expensive. But do try it.",

I made this twice and ended up eating this as a late night TV snacks when the kids went to bed and I was watching my recordings. It was so flavorful, the salmon was wonderful, the cucumber added that little crunch and it was just the perfect little morsel. My children loved it....my son, was to be expected, said it was alright because he's not much of a fish person. But at least I give kudos for trying it. Will totally be on my rotation for #gameday and any time I am in the mode ;-)",

As far as the tomatoes - I bought tomato halves in a dry-pack and used 12 halves and it was plenty.  The recipe is not real clear about that - cut very small as they can be a bit chewy.",
