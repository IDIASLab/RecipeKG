I used smoked paprika. The description is right on. The coating does create a shell and all the juices do stay in, leaving you a moist and tender chicken with a crust, even though there's no skin on the chicken. There is nothing in the flavour or texture that says this is made with nuts. It tastes like my grandmother's baked chicken made with wheat flour and spices. I messed up the method though.The amount left me a lot of flour so I used another thigh. In the end I used 5 bone-in thighs and after 25 minutes at 175\u00b0C, I cranked it up to 190\u00b0C and cooked another 37 minutes and they were perfect. Thank you Irismac for sharing your recipe.",
