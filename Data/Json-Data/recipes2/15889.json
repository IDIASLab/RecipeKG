The one thing that REALLY makes special these though is to add diced bell pepper to the top before baking. Dice the bell pepper VERY fine and just sprinkle a few (maybe 4 or 5) pieces on the top of the little toasts (I use a skinny baguette loaf sliced up) before baking. For a holiday party it is pretty to dice up red and green bell peppers! I bake these in a 400 degree oven for about 10 or 15 minutes. The spread can be made ahead a couple of days and kept in the fridge. I have also gone ahead and spread it on the bread slices topped it with the peppers and placed them all on a cookie sheet covered with plastic wrap in the fridge for a few hours. Great make-ahead party snack!",

I will be making this again. Oh I brought it to work assembled it and threw it in the toaster oven at 350 for about 7 minutes and then toasted it so that it got nice and brown on top.
