My boyfriend (who eats anything) didn't like them at all so I know that it wasn't just me. I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted honey for the sugar. Maybe that was the problem? They were kinda bitter at the same time being sickly sweet. I also thought the 1/2 cup of butter overrides any potential health benefit. I rarely rate anything bad but I did not care for these.

I tried using sucanat with this recipe instead of turbinado and poured in a little honey for good measure. I thought it was interesting all the comments about using honey. If you're vegan stick with the sucanat or turbinado. And 1Tb ground flax with 3Tb water will replace 1 egg. I think if you're not used to the unsweetened carob and over compensate with the honey it really won't be good. I couldn't rate this less then 4 stars!",
