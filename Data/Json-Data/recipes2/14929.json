I wish it was called something else so some people wouldn't be disappointed when making it!!!\n**************************************\n\nImportant Note: Instead of adding another jar of sauce like some of the other readers suggested, I just added 1/2 jar of water to the sauce and then simmered it for 20 minutes.\n\nThe reason that this recipe probably didn't have enough sauce when it finished baking was more than likely due to the fact that raviolis soak up water while they're cooking.  The addition of the extra water gives the raviolis the water to plump up, instead of using the water from the sauce.  This keeps the consistancy of the sauce like it should be, instead of drying out.  Another bonus is that you don't have to use an extra jar of sauce, which only  increases the expense of this dish unnecessarily.\n\nThis dish came out GREAT.. hope this tip helps :)",

Boil them in water if they are frozen or put them in the recipe still frozen.  Unfortunately, I 'thawed' them in the refridgerator and they stuck together in a clump.  I boiled the clump and it all worked out okay in the end but I think the results would have been somewhat better if I had just boiled them while still frozen before adding them to the recipe.  I should have known better (hanging head in shame).",

I chopped up several (more than 5) cloves of garlic and added to the sauce also adding a small amount of water to the sauce. Maybe a cup total. I used a 42 ounce jar of simple sauce and added fresh basil mushrooms and italian seasoning to it and simmered it on the stove for a bit. I am not sure why people give this recipe a poor review when the already written reviews are stating to add more water. This is a great recipe idea... no layering of sauce noodles ricotta sauce noodles ricotta - because the raviolis already contain enough ricotta. However if you have the time you can sprinkle a handful of mozz or what have you between layers. I recommend par-boiling the raviolis before preparing the dish. 30mins later: Fantastic! This was a really yummy meal - easy to make and a bit hit with everyone. A 13x9 will feed at least 8-10 people especially if you include garlic bread and salad! We (2 of us) barely put a dent in it. It will be great for leftovers and lunches for my man. Thanks for sharing!",
