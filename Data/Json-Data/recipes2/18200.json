I had to substitute crispy rice cereal for the nuts since I was making it for a friend who needs everything gluten-free (who knew my nuts would have wheat in them?). I used freshly picked wild plums (from this same friend) instead of the prunes. I accidentally left out the spices but these were still wonderful after I rolled them in chocolate almond bark with some real chocolate melted in there. My husband really doesn't want to share these!",
