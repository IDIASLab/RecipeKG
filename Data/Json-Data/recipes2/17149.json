There are just not enough occasions to use the combination of rosemary garlic white wine and olive oil. But it was the addition of the fresh tomatoes and black olives with the chicken that was a little different and I loved it too! The color contrast in particular was striking and they contributed a great deal of flavor. Please watch cooking time - if you want moist fork tender chicken the time directed is a tad long - about 5 minutes too long! I dusted the chicken in flour before sauteing then once the chicken was cooked through and the wine had reduced I removed it from the heat and swirled in a couple pats of butter for a rich velvety sauce. Served with a little pasta this was just excellent. Note: By all means use the garlic to taste - 6 cloves for two chicken breast halves is a tad much. Depending on their size of course two cloves should do it.",
