I cooked the chicken as according to the recipe, although I seasoned with pepper before breading.  For the sauce: first, I deglazed the pan (there were burnt parts of the breading, and NOTHING to drain), and got that clean.  Then, I added about 1/3 cup chicken broth and 3 tablespoons of butter, got that boiling and reduced it a bit.  Then added 2 tablespoons of lime juice (not from a lime), then chives, and the dill.  Prior to making the sauce, I mixed some flour with some water, made about a tablespoon's worth of the flour paste to thicken the sauce.  I added that last, and let it all boil for like a minute.  Then, I put the chicken back in and served.  Nice thick TASTY sauce.  Not too limey.  The dill flavor came out nicely.  It all blended SO well.  YUM!  Will definitely make again.",

The recipe says (after removing cooked chicken to a platter) to drain grease from the skillet---there is none left! Two tablespoons of olive oil get soaked up pretty quickly by the breaded chicken! The lime juice sizzles and almost immediately evaporates (in the form of steam) before you can add the butter. So you end up with dill flavored butter--not a bad thing but not quite what I was hoping for.",
