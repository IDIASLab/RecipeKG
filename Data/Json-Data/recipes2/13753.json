I added about 1 tsp Herb de Provence about 1/4 tsp garlic & onion powders & used double the amount of (frozen) mushrooms required. With those additions this recipe was delicious. I served it with fresh green beans which I steamed for 5 minutes then sauteed in a pan w/thinly sliced red onion pancetta cubes & a splash of balsamic vinegar) & white buttered rice - a spectacular meal in no time at all!

I do brown the chicken in a little olive oil salt and pepper. Remove the chicken add fresh mushrooms to the same pan and as other reviewers have said saute fresh mushrooms with butter (only real butter will do) salt and a small shake of pepper and white wine. I also often add scallions along with mushrooms for more flavor and color. Remove mushrooms and scallions from pan when golden brown. Set aside with the chicken. Lately I've replaced the cream of mushroom soup with a reduction sauce that I make with the pan drippings from the chicken and mushrooms adding a little more white wine (1/4 -1/2 cup). You can optionally add a little corn starch or flour to thicken. I do not add the flour or corn starch. The reduction sauce thickens on its own. While reduction sauce is simmering I place the chicken and most of the mushrooms in a baking dish. Add the sour cream to the pan with the sauce and mix. Pour sauce over chicken/ mushrooms adding remaining mushrooms on top. Bake as directed. Note: I now like \"real\" ingredients. That's why I don't add soup. Too many ingredients I can't pronounce and would not have in my pantry - going \"all natural\" when I can.",

I am really surprised by the reviewers who are so down on this recipe because it uses canned mushroom soup & canned mushrooms. It is so easy to make your own cream of anything soup & use fresh mushrooms instead of tinned ones. I am sure if they don't have a cream soup recipe already there are many very good ones on this site. It is a great recipe for both the novice (who will use the canned soup) & the more experienced cooks who will make the soup from scratch. Thanks for posting this.",
