Then I added the chopped, cooked bacon and the jalape\u00f1os, before stirring in the spices and cream cheese.

Yow! Next time I will use 1/2-1 can of jalape\u00f1os!

                "reviewBody": "We were really excited about trying this recipe. I followed the recipe with one adjustment. The recipe says to saute the onion in the bacon drippings without mentioning draining. I drained the majority of the drippings away, leaving just enough to skim coat the skillet. Even with that I wish I had drained more and I do think if I were a beginning cook that I might not have known to do that. There was something about the mixture of seasonings that didn't work for us, but we couldn't figure out if it was too much of one or not enough of another. The main criticism we had was too much cheese. It seemed to overwhelm the other ingredients so you had heat and you had cheese while other flavors faded into the backdrop. We like the idea of this enough to keep playing with it but as written, for us, it was OK.",

The onions sauteed in the bacon drippings gave it such a nice smokey flavor. I was rushed and didn't take the time to take the seeds out of the peppers as I normally would have but the cheese and sour cream tamed it down enough that I didn't really need to. This was delish! The boys at the party devoured this before I was even able to take a picture which means I will just have to make it again soon:) Thank you for sharing Jan.
