So I rolled out the dough as the recipe suggested but put the parm mix IN the middle of the dough rolled it up and made the knot placed it on the sheet and put another dollop of parm mix on top before baking instead of after. This way the parmesan would melt the seasonings would meld in the dough more and the outter parmesan would get crispy. Next time I'll use less oil since store bought biscuits are usually oily/buttery enough on their own.",
