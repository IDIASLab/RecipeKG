Return meat and season with basil, oregano, crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper. 5). Mix in bread crumbs, cheese, etc. 6)   Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil in the bottom of each cal then brush the exterior with same oil. 7). Fill caps then brush tops with oil. 8). Add remaining cheese to the top of the caps and bake. 9). For a slightly crunchy texture broil them for 2 minuets at the end.",
