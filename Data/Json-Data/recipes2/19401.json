I made homemade pizza dough and topped the unbaked crust with the sauce toppings (I added artichoke hearts - this was a welcome addition) and baked for 10 minutes... added the spinach and feta and baked another 10 minutes until cheese was beginning to brown/bubble. Although the mayo sauce wasn't bad - I feel that a garlic/olive oil sauce may have really given the pizza the flavor it needed to stand out. Also - a little mozzarella would have been nice too - it was a bit too much feta in my opinion. This is a good recipe for someone looking for something new.",

Since the mayo/feta mixture is heavy and moist it will saturate your dough and the heavy pizza will stick to your peel even with copious flour. So it's best to pre-bake raw dough for 10 minutes on this pizza. I used only 1/2 cup of feta and used 1.5 cups mozzaella cheese on the very top. It's best to cover the spinch with the cheese so the spinch won't shrink up too much or burn. I increased the garlic amount too. The onion didn't cook too well on this pizza; next time I may put then on the very top over the mozz. cheese or omit them entirely. Good white pizza.",
