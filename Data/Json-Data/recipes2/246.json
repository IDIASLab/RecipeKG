The only things I changed was to use half & half instead of milk cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom and most importantly I cut the biscuits in half and then rolled them into 4\" circles (only used 1 tube). There was plenty of dough. Too much for a whole biscuit plus the green beans mixture in one cupcake hole. It was perfect with half. Great recipe; will definitely make again!",
