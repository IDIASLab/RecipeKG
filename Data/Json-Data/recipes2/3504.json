I loved the seasoning that I used in the chicken so I went ahead and added that same seasoning to the pasta dish until it tasted right probably about 2 teaspoons. I garnished with avocado tomatoes chives red onions and strips of baked corn tortillas.",

I didn't have any cooked chicken so I used chicken tenderloins and pan fried them with taco seasoning. I then added the Progresso Starter and the 2 T of chopped green chilies (didn't want to use a whole can!) and boiled it a bit to thicken the sauce. I was really afraid of it being more like soup so I only added about 2/3 of the can of Starter. Then added the cooked mini penne. Stirred that up and grated some colby cheese on top topped with chopped tomatoes. I am pleased with this recipe and may be making it again.",
