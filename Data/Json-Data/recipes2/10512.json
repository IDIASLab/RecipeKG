Used a pound of steak for stir fry (from Wal-Mart) and seared it in the bottom of the pan without draining added a few dashes of chili powder while it was all simmering and a little sea salt. For garnish and to add a little more substance used some cut up flour tortillas that I had lightly cooked on the gas burner and added them to the top with the cheese and avocado. My wife and daughter loved it! I am quite happy with it too. I was afraid the onion would be overpowering but the flavors were well blended. I would suggest maybe cooking part of the peppers and garlic with the steak and letting those flavors come out a bit more but the recipe is quite good and one we are adding to the notebook for future use! Thanks for the addition to our food library! And made more than four servings.",
