Also you can pop the mix in the microwave if the chocolate starts drying too much as you make the spiders. I used butterscotch chips (point side down) for the eyes. My daughter said that they looked like spiders or mummy-babies and I think if you used white chocolate coating it would really look like a mummy head (I'd use chocolate chips for eyes with that one).
