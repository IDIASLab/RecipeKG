I was skeptical because I'm known for making great lemon bars, but I liked seeing methods different from my own and thought it would be fun to give these a try.  First,  I would like to note that I have hens and used very fresh eggs.  Also, I had organic lemons that I used.  I don't know if that would make a difference for others in taste.  Also, Land O Lakes butter is an excellent butter to use while baking.   I used a coconut oil non stick spray.  Despite the recipe totally being different from my own,  they were almost as good as my recipe (I HAVE to say that, right?).  I personally like to have a 50/50 ratio with lemon bars regarding the cookie versus the lemon filling because the cookie part is just as important in my life.  I give these five stars for taste and because it was great using every day ingredients I had in my house (yes, I had a bag of lemons).  I really enjoyed them.",
