Then instead of making it in an ice cream maker i put it into a ziplock bag and stuk it in the freezer layed out flat. It froze very quickly and was delicious. We ate it all with no left overs! The almonds are a great touch. This would also be delicious with peaches or rasberries instead of the almonds. I will definatly make this one again.",

I just take it out of the freezer about 15 minutes before serving to let it thaw a little. I have tried it with and without vanilla extract its food both ways and i also used coconut extract once and tossed in some coconut then sprinkled toasted coconut on top with a drizzle of chocolate sauce for a sundae sooo good!!!",
