It was just adults so I used a spicy BBQ sauce and didn't bother with the fancy cutouts. Because the meatballs themselves are so good in my opinion they should have less sauce.

To make them ahead of time I didn't bake the bbq sauce onto the meatballs. I made the meatballs the night before then added the sauce as a dip on the side. I had teens to feed so I used a spicy bbq sauce. To curb the heat I served ice cold milk in wine glasses for them. They loved it! Thank you for the recipe!",
