The only thing I did different was to use oregano rather than thyme and to go short on the cayenne.  Also I didn't process the spices together once I had them mixed up because I really prefer them without grinding.  I used a whole cut-up kosher chicken from Trader Joe's, and this was wonderful.  I made a mistake by not putting some of the seasoning under the skin, too, but I will do that next time also because we don't eat the skin--it just adds a little more flavoring to the chicken.  My hubby thanks you, too!  Thanks, Semigourmet!  EDIT:  I have used this rub in several ways.  I've coated boneless skinless chicken breasts with mayo, coated it with the rub, and stovetopped it with olive oil and butter for a quick dinner when time is of the essence!  Tonight I made my first whole chicken.  I used a half a stick of melted butter with a bunch of the rub.  I spooned some under the skin and in the cavity of the chicken and put the rest on top.  I roasted it for about 1:15 minutes at 350 when I used my Thermapen to test it.  It only needed a few more minutes to get to 160 degrees so it could rest and get the temperature to 165!  It is yummy!  Next time I will just use two tablespoons of butter to add to the rub.  Thanks, Semigourmet!  You have no idea how many times we've used this!",

I am so happy I found this this rub recipe. I wanted to roast a couple chickens that we had raised and butchered, and you really don't want to mess up a chicken you didn't just go to the store to buy...this did not disappoint.

I rubbed it on a whole chicken and let it sit for 8 hours in a ziplock, then cooked in the slow-cooker on high for 3 hours and finished it off to crisp up in the oven. I had to use ground celery seed instead of celery flakes. The second time (using the original portion size), I made it with the dehydrated celery flakes, allowing 4 chicken thighs to sit in the rub only 3 hours in an oven-proof bag, then baked in the oven (in the bag) and the taste was so much better even with less marinating time. The celery flakes give a crisper, fresher flavour. Both times we left out the salt. Thank you semigourmet for sharing your recipe.",

Since I am restricted on salt did not add the salt also did not have celery flakes so I used 1/2 tbsp. of celery seed which ground up perfectly in the small blender.  I used this mixture on a boneless pork shoulder roast which I roistered on the BBQ.   DS#2 had been outside and came to me said that dinner smelled wonderful and he could not wait for it to be ready.  The pork was full of great flavour and very moist.  Will be making again.

I made the recipe as stated with one exception:  I didn't have dried rosemary, so I placed fresh rosemary sprigs under the breast skin and inside the cavity.  I rubbed two chickens with olive oil, sprinkled on the rub, and threw a fresh lemon half into each cavity, along with the rosemary.  Roasted the chickens for 2 hours at 375.  The skin is  crispy and richly colored, and the meat has a great flavor.  There is easily enough left for two more chickens.  Thanks for posting your idea, Semigourmet!",
