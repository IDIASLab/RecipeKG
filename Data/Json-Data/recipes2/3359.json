This definitely requires way more liquid though. I made it exactly as written and ended up having to add another 3/4 cup of milk. I made it the night before around 11pm and when I went to eat it in the morning around 7am, it was one big solid mass that could barely be stirred. With the additional milk though, it was still thick, but a very good consistency. Normally for overnight oats, the standard guideline is a 2:1 ratio of liquid/yogurt to oats, so this recipe would work best with 2 cups of milk.  Cardamom is quite pricey, but it definitely makes this recipe so don't leave it out!",

I add a touch of agave to sweeten it skip the cardamom (sub an extra 1/4 tsp of cinnamon) and add a touch of cloves since I love them. It smells and tastes more like an oatmeal cookie to me so next time I'll add raisins too! I portion this out for breakfasts at work and add a few slivered almonds or walnuts on top. So good and filling! This will absolutely remain on my breakfast rotation.",
