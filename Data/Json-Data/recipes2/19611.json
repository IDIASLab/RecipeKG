They kept falling apart and weren't pretty tight balls. I tried using a small cookie scoop I tried using my hands I let them harden in the freezer some and then tried squishing them with my hands. I finally gave up and just drizzled the chocolate on them and got the best picture I could. I wonder if the type coconut I used was the problem. It was the unsweetened tiny flakes (like hairs) not the wider kind. Perhaps the broader coconut would have held together better?",
