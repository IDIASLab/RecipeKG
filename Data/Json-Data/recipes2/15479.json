No leftovers. I used small boiling onions and steamed them to tender. I sauteed them the night before and added all the remaining ingredients. I put it all into a container to marinade overnight (for convenience). The next day I put them in a pan over high heat and it thickened beautifully. I was very pleased with the result. I will definitely make this again and again. Thanks!",
