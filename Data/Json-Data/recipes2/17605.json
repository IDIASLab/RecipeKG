To be honest I didn't have mushrooms and I didn't have white wine. I went ahead and just doubled the onions and used red wine instead(I know). When everything was mixed together before baking I was a little worried that my \"batter\" mixture was like dipping the chicken in oatmeal. However I shrugged off the texture and gave it a go. I was actually pleasantly surprised. It bakes up like a casserole and is excellent over rice. The chicken came out moist and the sauce was more like a tangy stuffing with all the crushed cracker. One addition made a big difference. Before I put the \"casserole\" in the oven I crushed half another packet of crackers over the top. At first I thought I made a mistake because these seemed to burn but in the end it actually added a good crunch.",
