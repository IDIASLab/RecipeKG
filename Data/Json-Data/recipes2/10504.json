I do usually make tuna with mayo and relish along with some chopped egg but I did make this as listed. The initial flavor isn't horrible but it leaves an unpleasant after-taste. From now on I will make my tuna with mayo and maybe avocado for an extra creaminess but my usual recipe will stay the same.",

However I thought this had too much sour cream; probably half the amount would have been fine. But maybe that's what made it a \"mousse\" to the submitter. I used a couple tablespoons of fresh minced yellow onion instead of dried. I also ended up adding some garlic salt black pepper and dried cilantro.",
