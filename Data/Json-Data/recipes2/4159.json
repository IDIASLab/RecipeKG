Its crunchiness is nice but it's also a bit slimy (for lack of a better word) and really doesn't have much flavor if any. I don't think it adds anything to the salad and I would omit in the future particularly considering it was expensive. IMHO what really makes this salad unusual is the grapefruit. I served this with the recommended Habanero Heat Salad Dressing which was a good complement.",

An easy alternative to jicama can be a green mango (NOT ripe and sweet). It will offer the same crunchiness but with a bit of tartness at the same time. Second alternative can be to use pineapple. NOT from a can but freshly cut. Thanks for the recipe.",

I would add more cilantro too or offer more on the side for the cilantro fans. I made the suggested Habanero Heat Salad Dressing (see my review there) and it is wonderful! However I opted to mix it with the salad just before serving and it was completely lost in the salad. (I doubled the salad recipe to 12 and made the 12 servings of dressing (was not even close to 12). Next time I'll offer the dressing to drizzle on top of the salad and make lots more dressing. That should be an awesome taste hit. This salad is so moist that mixing dressing in it isn't likely to work well under any circumstances.",
