Fine with me I'd eat another every hour or so ha. These were the classic popcorn balls and as the evening progressed they got a little better - more solid and with a little chewiness that I really liked. The only trouble that I had was forming the balls with oiled hands - they were still falling apart. I thought \"oh no... I am a popcorn ball failure!\" Then I remembered to put the oiled bags on and that did the trick! Yummy.",
