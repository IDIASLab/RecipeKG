My 3 kids ate this with no problem. Very nice weeknight recipe comes together very quickly. I also used pasta water to thicken sauce instead of cornstarch. Thanks for an easy and good recipe.",

Mine was a little salty but that was my fault.I used chicken bouillon instead of broth and then added more soy sauce.I cooked up the whole box of pasta but did not use it all I think 3/4 of a box was plenty. I also marinated the chicken in soy sauce and a little rice wine vinagar but I am sure it would have been fine without it.Will make again.",

I sliced my carrot as opposed to shredding them cooked them a bit longer than the other veggies. I used linguine as I was out of Angel hair pasta. Also did not have Chinese black bean and garlic sauce so just tossed in approximately 3 tsp of chopped garlic. I marinated the chicken in Teriyaki sauce prior to cooking. I only used half the amount of pasta called for but the same amount of broth. This ratio of broth to pasta was perfect. I will make this recipe again with the following changes double the amount of sauce add a larger variety of veggies use Teriyaki chicken & chopped garlic. Overall a lovely basic recipe.",
