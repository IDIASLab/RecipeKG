If you make the sauce ahead of time and refridgerate over night the flavors become 5 times more rich and delish! then just heat up and add the mussels! all the mussels were gone in less than 5 minutes and everyone was raving. I used 4 1/2 lb of mussels and they just barely fit in the amount of sauce. will use 4lb next time.",
