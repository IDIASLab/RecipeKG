I had a hard time with adding a raw egg yolk in to the cream cheese mixture so after the marshmallow and milk were smooth I added two spoons of the hot marshmallow/milk mix to a small bowl with the egg yolk. After mixing well I poured into back into the pot and cooked for another minute while stirring. Then I added it to the cream cheese mix then added a splash of vanilla extract. I really had doubts that this pie would set up but after 3 hours it was set. I would recommend chilling for longer though for better flavor. I topped this pie with Supreme Strawberry Topping from this site but might try added green tea powder to the batter next time for a more Japanese flair. This is a great no-bake cheesecake that is light and not too sweet can't wait to make again!",
