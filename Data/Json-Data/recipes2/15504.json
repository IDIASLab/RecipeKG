To avoid the green beans being over cooked I have found if you simmer the dressing for a while before adding the green beans it will thicken up and coat the green beans nicely and you will avoid over cooking them. (By the way I use the Zesty Italian Dressing) Update: I have now started using a Fat Free Italian Dressing. So there is no oil to worry about! (When using the Zesty Dressing I would just turn the bottle updside down and let the oil float to the top so when I removed the cap there was less oil).",

The recipe has you using way to much butter to begin with has you cooking the beans a lot longer than necessary and the taste isn't that great. Tastes like green beans with salad dressing.
