I substituted 1/4 cup oat bran for some of the white flour, used egg whites only, no yolks, and thinned with water no milk, and no oil-just applesauce.  Tasted great, very filling.  Will make again for sure.  I have mixed up the dry ingredients into plastic bags so I only need to add wet stuff to make, much faster that way on the weekend for a quick breakfast.",

Yes I agree that they are tasteless BUT that is the fun part about these pancakes. My 29 month old liked them with blueberry fruit spread my 13 month old liked them plain and my husband and I liked them with honey....everyone wins! To thin them out more I just used more milk and the batter was fine. I plan on making these pancakes agin and freezing them for a really quick delicious and nutrious breakfast!",

I used all WW Pastry Flour halved the recipe but worked with 2 eggs. I ground up dark brown flax seeds in my coffee grinder and added those in. I totally missed the canola but we didn't notice. I had added a bit extra applesauce so maybe that took the place. I used more milk because WW seems to soak it up more. I was afraid that I had overbeat my whites because they didn't want to incoorporate for a while. But the finished product was fantastic! Added walnuts for even more fiber. Great start to the day thanks for sharing this recipe!",

This recipe was perfect. I used whole wheat white flour instead of unbleached homemade organic applesauce vegetable oil and lowfat buttermilk. These turned out fluffy and delicious. I made a low-sugar strawberry topping to put on the top of these and topped off with a small dollop of whipped cream--like the fruit pancakes that we used to get for the boys on their birthday at Sheri's. Quite a bit healthier but the kids never noticed. This made quite a few additional for me to freeze in groups of two to stick in the toaster for busy mornings when the kids still want a hot breakfast too.",
