I added extra veggies [asparagus tips, green onion, baby spinach, matchstick size carrots] and doubled the cilantro and coconut milk (but did not double the jalapenos) to compensate for extra veggies. Also used minced ginger in tube + regular chicken broth, and jar minced garlic. We like our food HOT in New Mexico, so I added some red pepper flakes.  For serving I topped with fresh chopped cilantro and green onions.  A++ recipe. We loved it and will definitely make again.",

                "reviewBody": "I loved this dish. It was packed full of flavor and was not very difficult to make. I did not add eggplant to the dish but other than that did not make an changes. I used a long grain Jasmine rice and it was very simple to make. Next time I make this I will replace the water I cooked the rice in with some coconut milk and Swanson Thai Ginger Flavor Infused Broth for added flavor. By adding the turmeric to the rice it gave it a nice yellow color without changing the flavor of it. This in turn gave it a nice color contrast to the protein. The chicken and vegetables were very easy to cook and the instructions were straight forward. I would add some of the seeds from the jalapenos next time for a little bit of heat (just a personal preference). It was a great dish and one that I will be adding to my recipe box.",
