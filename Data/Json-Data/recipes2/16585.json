When I made this right out of the gate I added basmati rice which has a longer cook time (no mush) cumin and about 4 1/2 cups of extra water. Next time I may try to make a vegetarian version so I can serve small bowls of it before the Pork & Sauerkraut bonzana.",

I used 2 cans of black-eyed peas drained & rinsed rather than the dried beans. I used ground hickory smoked sausage because of an issue with chewing & swallowing meat. I added garlic powder when the flavor needed a little something at the end. Next time I'll use several cloves of minced garlic I'll add a chopped onion & I'll use a while head of cabbage as there wasn't enough for us. You also need to check on this every 10-15 minutes ready to add water or it will burn. I use a gas stove & after bringing to a boil I reduced the heat to the lowest setting. I almost burned it & it only needed to cook for 1 hour as the rice started to get that weird sticky mushy thickening thing that happens when starch breaks down too much. But we truly loved it! This is going to be added to our regular winter-time meal rotation not just to ring in the New Year! We loved it! The neighbor's did also! I would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the changes I made",
