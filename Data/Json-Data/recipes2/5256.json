        "description": "When we lived in Geneva, there was a famous restaurant that only served one thing: entrecote. Also known as steak-frites, it's thin-sliced hanger steak cooked to order, covered in the most addictive herb butter sauce I've ever had. People literally line up out the door every night to get in--and this is why. After playing with several bloggers' guesses about the sauce ingredients, including some that involved chicken livers, this combination came pretty darn close to our memory of the experience. Serve with shoestring fries.",

The one change I knew I had to make to suit our taste was in the preparation of the steaks. We are a grilled steak kind of people and so I grilled them rather than pan fry. With that being said regardless of how you prepare the steaks themselves I do think they needed some seasoning. The sauce has good flavor but it wasn't quite enough. I tested this by preparing one plain as the recipe stated to do and on the other one I sprinkled some Cavenders. The one with the Cavenders was hands down better than the other. The sauce had really good flavor but keep in mind that it is a very thin sauce. Overall this is a good recipe and one that would impress guests.",
