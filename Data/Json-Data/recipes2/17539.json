So I was looking through egg recipes for already boiled eggs and I wasn't finding much more than egg salad or deviled eggs. So when I came on this one I was intrigued. It seems a bit weird but I'm okay with the ingredients (sans butter--my tummy doesn't do well with it so I always sub margarine). So I decided to try it just subbing margarine and scaling it to one serving. I didn't use my mixer bc I was making one serving and we use the spreadable margarine. It was the perfect amount for one slice of bread and it really isn't bad. It tastes like margarine (would be butter if you use that obviously) with a little bit of egg yolk and spice in it. I wouldn't make it every day but it's a fun little snack. Thanks for the recipe!",
