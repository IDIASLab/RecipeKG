I also added a minced jalapeno pepper along with a full jar of hot chunky salsa.  i omitted the rice and added chopped chicken. I had some red peppers, so i chopped them up and threw them in.  yum!  even my daughter, who is not a big veggie lover, really enjoys this recipe!  thank you!!  ",

He followed the recipe exactly except for the rice which it turned out I was short on and he used Vegan \"No Chicken Broth\". When I first tasted this soup it was not what I expected. Somehow I was expecting the super salty taste that we expect from Progresso and the like this soup is more mild. After I took a couple of bites I was hooked. This is a delictabley flavorful soup. It is not all salt and broth it lets the individual flavors of the ingriedents shine through. We used Medium Salsa so the flavor was not really spicy I think that is what threw me. It was truly wonderful though. I will make it again and again.",
