Now put it in the microwave to soften the butter (this only takes a few seconds) and then take a fork and whip it. If the curdling is not gone after whipping put it back in the microwave and whip again. Now add your spices. Beat and then put in the frig to harden. You can always take it out to reach room temp if you prefer...and add ground pecans to it too.More spices if you prefer.I used brown sugar instead of XXX sugar and only enough to lighly sweeten.",
