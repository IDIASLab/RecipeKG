Flavor was excellent only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's way too oily. I will be making this more but with half the oil or less next time.

Instead of garlic salt I used 2 tsps of chopped garlic and added that in with the onion and ginger. Instead of red bell pepper all I had was a 12 oz jar of roasted red pepper so I added that 5 minutes before serving and let it simmer. Since I have 2 toddlers I substituted the can of peas with 1 cup frozen peas and carrots. My husband and my picky toddler loved it! Thanks for sharing this recipe!",
