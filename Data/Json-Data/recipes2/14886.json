I think it is very much like the recipe on the Chex cereal boxes but I could not find the one I cut off the box and I was making it with Crispix cereal and it is not on that box. I always put in 2 cups of Honey Combs. Everyone loves the little bit of sweet mixed in. I usually double the spices and use a whole stick of margarine. I've also added Honey Nut Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. My son told me to leave the Cinnamon cereal out from now on and he is the one who eats most of it. We all prefer it to the store brought brand.",

I checked my boxes and although the \"recipe\" for Chex Mix wasn't listed on the boxes I had purchased I'm pretty sure it tastes the same as their recipe...therefore I didn't find it all that \"unique.\" Still I personally like this over the store-bought/pre-mixed Chex Mix but I think the two recipes are one and the same.",
