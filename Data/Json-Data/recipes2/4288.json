The batter was good, but too salty, and I like salt more than the average Joe. I would cut back to 4 tablespoons of garlic salt. Also, pepper is to taste, and I found it a little too much, as well. Remember, when frying chicken, dip first in the flour mix, then the egg dip, then back into the flour, and the coating will hold tight to the chicken, better than egg first and then flour. My kids, 6 and 7, loved it, but it was too salty. ",

Also I used 1 1/2 cups flour and 1 1/2 cups of italian bread crumbs. For a simple recipe this was VERY GOOD. Once everyone added salt to their chicken they gobbled it up. I used 7 large chicken breasts cut up into strips and there was plently even extra for 9 people and that was with almost everyone going back for 3rds even 4ths. I also did the egg flour egg flour dip like others suggested and I had plently of flour mixture but I needed 4 more eggs for that. The kids LOVED the coating! Also I wish that the recipe said about how long you should fry the chicken but I guess it all depends on the size of chicken you use after a few trial and errors it took about 6 to 7 mins to completely cook the strips and the chicken was surprisingly juicy. Next time I will probably try adding some chicken seasoning for alittle more flavoring but even as is it's pretty good. I am definatly making this a regular recipe in our house. THANKS!!!",
