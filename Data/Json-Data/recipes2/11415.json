By consensus we agreed that the presentation was attractive but there was still a bit of 'aftertaste' similar to chemical artificial sweeteners. The pancake consistency was not as 'cakey' as a pancake made with cane sugar rather dense and heavy. This was my first experience with using a Stevia product. Thank you for the opportunity.",
