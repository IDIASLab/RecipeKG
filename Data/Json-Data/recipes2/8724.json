Any flavor you desire is possible by changing the extract and food coloring. This recipe allows you to have as many flavored morsels as there are extracts for a fraction of the cost. Enjoy!",

I almost gave up then found your recipe!\nI used Ghirardelli white chocolate melting wafers and my chocolate stayed nice and smooth to pipe out the entire time.  Added the lemon extract but kept the chocolate white.  A nice addition to the lemon cookie recipe I found on this site as well.\nThank you, again!!!  Couldn't have been easier but I definitely need to get better at making my chips the same size :)",
