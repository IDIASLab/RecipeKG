I used all reduced fat dairy products leaner beef and turkey pepperoni. I also saut\u00e9ed green pepper onion and mushrooms (per suggestion that additional pizza toppings can be added) before cooking the ground beef. The flavor was okay but it was just a bit to salty to me. I don't know if it was the pepperoni cheese and other canned or jarred items in combination. Not something I would make again but it was interesting to try a different baked spaghetti recipe. I might just not prefer spaghetti this way as I have always felt it made it a little on this dry side. This one had just enough sauce but the top got rather dry in the oven. I will see if others like this combination.",
