It definitely was simple but I found the end result was dry with weird pasty areas where the curry mixture had cooked on top of cauliflower. It just seemed like the mixture should have been very evenly and thinly spread over the cauliflower to prevent the clumpy texture. I ended up scraping some of the mixture off after it was cooked. The tops had tons of curry flavor while the rest of the florets were still white with no flavor. A sprinkle of salt definitely improved things. I almost would have preferred heating the sauce separately and using it as a dip for the cooked cauliflower. Thanks for sharing your recipe Griz!",
