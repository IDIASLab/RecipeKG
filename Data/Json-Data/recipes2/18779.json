I used ground cayenne as a substitute and rolled in panko bread crumbs after dredging in the batter. Fabulous I will make again and again!!!! I only gave the 4 stars because I added salt which I feel is a must with a recipe like this. Love the batter idea instead of flour egg bread crumb.....",

Therefore just add the crushed red pepper flakes to your taste more for spicier. I used Bud Light for the beer. The batter should not be real thick but you should have a light thin coating so you taste the tomatoe more than the flour. Thank you again for your reviews:)",
