This is a beautiful and delicious dish - big payoff for little effort - I had this served in minutes from start to finish.  I exercised self-discipline tonight and rather than serving it over rice I used \"Miracle Rice.\"  (Described as \"Shirataki rice, guilt free rice, zero calories, soy free, gluten free.\"  I can handle that)",

I decided to add some thinking that i would pick them out.  We ate the tomatoes too, as it had all the flavors of this dish.  I served this over pasta.   think it's the combination of the flavors that makes it perfect.  Definitely recommended, and will be making again.",

I used much more spinach, and next time will definitely try others suggestions and add lemon and/or white wine (meant to do it this time but forgot!)  But even as it stands is really good...sop up the sauce with fresh rolls..yum, I wish there was some leftover I'd have it for breakfast! Update: have made this several times and often add about 1/2 cup of veggie broth to the butter and oil, and reduce it a bit, gives a bit more sauce and some extra flavour..oh yes and the wine!  Maybe this is varying too much from the original recipe but the end result is 5 stars!",
