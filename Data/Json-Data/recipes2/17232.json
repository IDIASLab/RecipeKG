It's great without the extras (such as the juice or in some recipes sweet & sour mix). I don't mind the addition of the coconut rum which I never saw before this recipe - not too shabby. To help with sinking the raspberry to the bottom turn a spoon over face down and touch the inside edge of your cocktail glass. Slowly drizzle the raspberry onto the spoon and down the inside of the glass.;-)",
