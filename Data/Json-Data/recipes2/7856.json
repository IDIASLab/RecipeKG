I also mixed my own herbs de Provence by using a recipe on this site. My chicken stock was also homemade. Delicious!",

The second time that's happened that it didn't make it home from the store with me!). I'm not sure that the added expensive dried mushrooms were totally worth the taste because the others would have been just fine. I did use the herbs as described in a recipe here on this site. Be careful not to burn the potatoes---cook them on a low heat and consider covering them to speed up that process so the butter doesn't overheat. These are delicious and I'd really recommend that you use creme fraiche (use Chef John's recipe here on this site if you have time). Definitely company worthy! Thanks so very much! Yum!",

This is not a fast or quick dish but for anyone who loves mushrooms/potatoes this is it! This is definitely a dish to use to impress someone! It'll work trust me!",
