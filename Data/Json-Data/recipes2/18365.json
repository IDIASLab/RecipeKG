I wasn't content with the breaking up of the pollock- When you toss it all up with the pasta in the end it breaks up so much that you barely taste it and makes the dish paste-y. I used less butter more garlic caramelized the onions and added some homemade pickled cauliflower/carrot. This may have detracted from the original taste but we felt it needed veggies and that was our only solution. Looking back I would rinse them next time before chopping and adding the mix. I potentially foresee a remake of this dish without the fish changes to the sauce and adding veggies. Thanks for the inspiration!",
