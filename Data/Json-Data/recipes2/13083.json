A few things I added to enhance the flavors which were a little garlic and onion powder and a pinch of parsley. I added a good amount of sea salt and black pepper and then a 1/4 cup of crushed butter crackers on top for a bit of crunch. I recommend using red or golden potatoes as they add to the buttery-ness of the whole dish. We all loved this - comfort food indeed.",

I make a potatoes au gratin dish that is almost identical to this so I thought I could take a short cut, as that recipe does not require precooking. However, after being in the oven on 375 for 2 hrs, the potatoes still weren't cooked! But the main objection I have to this recipe is that after waiting all that time to eat the dish, it wasn't even good! I don't know if it was the mayo sauce poured over, something is clearly wrong with this recipe.",
