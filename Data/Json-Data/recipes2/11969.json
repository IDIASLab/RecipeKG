I would have preferred more flavors like taco seasoning w/ the meat/jalapeno mixture green onions and sour cream but that's my personal preference in fact hubby loved them just as is which was a huge surprise lol. I did put it together a bit differently too...I put some chips on the bottom the meat mixture/salsa/cheese more chips and cheese. Note that most of the chips do get soggy so if you're not a fan take that into consideration. All in all these came together quickly and the family was happy. I would make these again but add in my changes. Thanks for sharing.:)",
