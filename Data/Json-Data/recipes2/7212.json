I also finely chopped the basil (the boyfriend is not a fan of green things) and grated fresh mozzarella. I've been dating my bf for about two months and cook every other day usually from scratch. He said this was his favorite dish so far (sort of disappointing since it's partly packaged) but his only complaint was my tomato chunks were big. He asked me to make this a staple recipe. 4 stars because I just can't get over the packaged flavored rice",

Next time I will use cheese but will add chicken broth to boost the flavor. This recipe is not terrible.
