Once they are golden brown on each side, I find it is best to drain on a rack placed on top of the paper towel, the rack will keep the fish crispy along with frying at the proper temperature.",

Normally I read the reviews but this time I thought with these ingredients you can't go wrong....boy I was wrong. I ended up making 3 batches of the breading (I used 3 lbs of fish so I had changed the number of servings). Doing the batches on the fly was a pain. Then I had used partially frozen fish so my breading was basically mush before frying and letting it sit in the fridge. My recommendations are to double or triple this recipe use fresh or completely thawed fish and when putting it in the fridge make sure it is in a single layer in your pan. By the way the taste of the seasoning wasn't bad but wasn't my favorite by far.",

The only problem we had with it was it was too salty from the cajun seasoning (Tony Cachere's). I doubled the dry ingredients per other reviewer's suggestions, and still had to make more when I had about 1/3 of my fish left and not enough breading. For the second batch of breading I skipped the seasoning and added the spices myself - garlic powder, ground cayenne & chili peppers, and a dash each of paprika & cumin. Much better because it wasn't salty. All in all a good recipe but watch out for the salt in your seasoning!",
