It tasted very good, my son who usually only likes meat with BBQ sauce took a second helping.  I made red smashed potatoes as a side, and my husband used the extra sauce as gravy for the potatoes.

I also added about a half tablespoon flour to the cooked sauce to thicken it a bit - it just seemed too liquidy. I'm not a fan of dredging many things in flour and while it had a good taste and crispness I think next time I'll make it without that part. But all in all it was delicious served with a chicken flavored rice pilaf corn and sugar snap peas. Will make again!",
