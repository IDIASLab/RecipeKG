My mom would make this during Lent for the family, but you'll want to make it all year round. My husband (who hates tuna), raves about this dish. It's different and very delicious. Tastes even better heated the next day. Serve with some garlic bread and a salad and you have a complete dinner.",

Use 8 0z. chopped black olives; 4.) use 3 cloves pressed garlic cloves 1 tsp dried basil and 1/2 tsp dried oregano 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes; 5.) Add 3 TBS capers (these really make a difference!); and 6.) Top with grated Romano cheese for extra flavor. Allow flavors to blend in refrigerator before serving.",

And I always adjust recipes to suit my own taste anyway. I added rosemary capers and sea salt. I had no tomato puree so I used crushed and whole tomatoes broken up (with a pinch of sugar). It's important to use the solid white not chunk light tuna. I used 12 oz of solid white and didn't add it until cooking was almost done so that it would not disintegrate. I was very liberal with the olive oil and garnished with lots of fresh basil.",

It was good nothing sensational but something different. It's a really mild (bland) flavor. I did sub the whole peeled tomatoes for diced tomatoes so maybe that would have made the difference between good and great. 5/4/06 UPDATE: I have changed my rating of this recipe based on the fact that I had so much extra sauce I had to freeze it. It's still in my freezer I know we'll never eat it and I hate looking at it!",
