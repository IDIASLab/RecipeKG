I am vegetarian so I replaced the chicken broth by adding the juice drained from the garbanzos to enough water to make 1 1/2 cups liquid and adding some vegetarian chicken style seasoning. I also added 1 tsp. curry powder 1/8 tsp. garlic and increase the allspice to 1/2 tsp. since I did not have the cardamom or coriander on hand. Instead of orange juice I use water with 1-2 tablespoons of fresh lemon or lime juice and leave out the orange zest. I did not think I would like the raisins in this but they added a nice bit of sweetness and blend nicely with the flavors of the recipe.",

I loved the contrasting textures of the creamy garbanzos and the crisp veggies plus the occasional sweet bite of raisin. I used fresh ginger (which I added with the beans) and vegetable broth and I caramelized the onions (after toasting the spices I removed them and then added them back in with the peppers and zucchini). This is definitely a keeper for me as is but I'll try it with 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice a bit of honey and some lemon zest and I'll adjust the broth accordingly and see if my boyfriend likes it that way (although I don't think the lemon will go as well with the flavors of the spices).",
