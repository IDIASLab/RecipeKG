It turns out best when I add a little bit less oil and honey, and replace about \u00bc cup vinegar with \u00bc cup white wine.  I use whole a couple of whole basil stocks, stems and leaves and run everything but the garlic through the food processor and let stand overnight.  I then strain out the basil and add minced garlic.  It is a beautiful emerald green color and the flavor is amazing!!!",
