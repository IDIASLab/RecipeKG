The nuts and nutritional yeast you can buy in the bulk bins so it isn't too expensive to give this recipe a try. I did like the sauce better heated.. different taste and it thinned out some too. If you dont like kale spinach would work in this too. I added a few more red pepper flakes and really enjoyed this different meal",

They blended up just fine. I also was sure to use full fat coconut milk. Don't want to skimp on the fat when you're trying to mimic cheese. I used way more of the spices than the recipe called for but that may have been because my chili powder is pretty old. Also I heated up the sauce which I'm assuming you're supposed to do anyways but that changes the flavor a fair amount. Just keep that in mind as you're testing it out of the blender. It tastes pretty yeasty at room temperature. I'm not vegan just dairy free so I added chicken which was delicious.",
