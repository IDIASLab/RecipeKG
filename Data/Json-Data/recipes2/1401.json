The second time around I added a bit more sausage, just because I had already thawed it out, and I used red peppers because the green didn't look all that great at the store.  Still very good with more sausage but didn't really love the sweetness of the red peppers.  Back to the green for next time.  There are only two of us in my house so I freeze two more meals for the future.  They do freeze well too.  I would reccommend trying this recipe if you have been searching for a GOOD stuffed pepper recipe like I was until I found this one.  Thank you for sharing!",

The recipe tells you to put the peppers in the oven at 350 degrees however it does not tell you for how long. I did make a change by spraying Pam on the bottom of the Pyrex and also adding some of the pasta sauce on the bottom. We also added a bit more mozzarella you can never have too much cheese! I will definitely make them again.",
