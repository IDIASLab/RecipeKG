We had extended family over, and we all thought it was very good and that the tomato mixture along with the guacamole made it!  I did use a package seasoning to marinate the steak before grilling it but thought it actually needed a bit more flavor than what that mix imparted.  I'd be tempted next time to visit the nearest Mexican restaurant to pick up some meat!  I had to forego the red pepper flakes because of family members' needs.  This was perfect!  Thanks, b.d.weld!",
