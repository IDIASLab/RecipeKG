We added some things that we think kicked the recipie up a few notches: 1/2 of a medium vidalia onion Use Sweet White Corn instead of Yellow Small Bundle of Cilantro chopped Few Dashes of Salt (to taste) Fresh Ground Pepper (to taste) Two Small Jalipeno Peppers Chopped and Seeded. Thanks for the great recipie. It's a little more expensive to make due to all the fresh ingredients but it is soooo worth it. ----Nuri",
