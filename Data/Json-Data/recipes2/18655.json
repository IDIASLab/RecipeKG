I used brown rice cooked in chicken stock and I used low fat half and half instead of milk. I had some that I needed to use up. I used Monterey Jack cheese and added about a 2 tablespoons of feta cheese with tomato and basil. I also used Durkees Steak Seasoning. By using the steak seasoning and the feta cheese this turned out to be a very flavorful casserole. Several people asked be for the recipe. I will be making this again.",

I also used a full 8 oz. monterey jack cheese. I had half of a can of evaporated milk from when I made BBQ Glazed Homemade Meatballs(also from this site) so I used that so there was no waste. I added a tsp. of Frank's hot sauce and a tbsp. of Jack Daniel's dijon mustard. Just trying to pep it up a bit. I'll update how everyone liked it after dinner. EDITED: Meh.
