I didn't have cream cheese with chives so I used lite cream cheese and added my own fresh chives. I decreased the dijon a bit (2 tsp.) and used flour tortillas. I also used a smoked deli turkey and sliced swiss cheese vs. shredded. The addition of the bacon and avocado took this over the top! The flavor combinations in this wrap are simply perfect! You could easily substitute another kind of cheese but I love swiss. My husband loves bacon so he definitely gave it the thumbs up!",

They have since joined this website for more recipes and tips.  I made them again for my kids lunchbox.  They are picky eaters and my 16 yr. old LOVED them!!!  I made them with low fat chive and onion cream cheese and low fat swiss cheese.  I also added some finely chopped sweet onion as well for extra flavour.  I loved the combination of the dijon mustard and cream cheese.  Next time I may use turkey bacon instead of regular bacon to cut even more fat.  I really liked the avacado and I am wondering if cucumber might be a nice addition as well....This has been added to my recipe box!!!",

The only tweaking I did was that I used bacon bits (sparingly since they can become quite overpowering taste bud wise) & I used plain cream cheese and bought fresh chives which I cut up and mixed together with the cream cheese.

Super simple to make rolled them up and off to the picnic and music in the park we went! Tasted great. Will definately make again.",
