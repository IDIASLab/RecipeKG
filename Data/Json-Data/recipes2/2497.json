It's also shaped like a football, which of course has been proven to taste better to people drinking beer than dips in a bowl. Speaking of beer, I think this will pair nicely with something cheap, domestic, and in a can.",

We were also having a potato bar so it was great to use as a topping for the potatoes. After reading the reviews I decided to add a little more spice to the dip part: worcestershire sauce, Cayanne pepper, and smoky spice. I should have watched Chef John\u2019s video as I believe chilling it for a couple of hours would have made it more moldable. It was pretty soupy so I put it in an oval casserole -which ended up fine, just not as pretty without the green onion grass. Flavor was still just a 3, but it was eaten and made the table look fun!",
