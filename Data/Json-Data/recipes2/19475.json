We added 1/2 can evaporated milk 1 tsp basil 2 cloves garlic to the blender and a few dashes (to taste) of hot sauce to each individual bowl. My kids said gross we don't eat green food and then they finished their bowls. Great fun detox before all the candy this week. Doubled made way too much for 6 people so we froze the second half. Next time I would also cut back on the olive oil by about 1/2.",
