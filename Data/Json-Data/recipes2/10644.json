Top that with all of your favorite fixings and it doesn't get much better than that. Most taco bowls I've had are filled dominantly with lettuce and lettuce is boring to me when it comes to tacos. In and out of the kitchen in less than 30 minutes? Yes please! I had a little rice/pinto accident in between filling my 1st and 2nd bowl and it ended up on the floor so the picture I've attached was actually done with what I had on hand which was the Uncle Ben's Ready Jasmine Rice. The Pinto Beans and Rice was definitely the better bowl. Thanks for the great recipe b.d.weld!",
