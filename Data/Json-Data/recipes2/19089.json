This was delicious and one of the few pasta dishes I've made that I felt the pasta/sauce ratio was right on for us. The sauce was thick enough in my opinion before simmering but I did it anyway. With leftover chicken I could easily make this dish in the time it takes to make the pasta. I added a fresh basil garnish and would probably adjust the cayenne depending on my mood at the time. I scaled it for two in case it wasn't well received but wish I had made enough for leftovers.",
