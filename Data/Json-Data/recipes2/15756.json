                "reviewBody": "UPDATE DEC 2010 If you can't find true blackberry wine (Manichewitz) and French Vanilla cake mix don't waste your money or time in my opinion. Grocer was out of the wine and I used another so-called blackberry wine that was anything but. Same thing w/cake mix. Didn't begin to take like the original cake. If you've never tried the cake with the originally suggested ingredients you won't know the difference. BUT if you have made this cake with the originally suggested ingredients and then switch to something lesser you will be disappointed in my opinion. LOVE this cake! If you can't find Blacberry gelatin I have used raspberry with great success. I also recommend the French Vanilla cake mix. I pour 1/2 of the glaze over the cake while it is cooling in the pan for 10 minutes. Then I invert it onto my cake plate and spoon over the top the remaining glaze. This gives you a moist cake on the top and bottom. Definitely a crowd pleaser and one my family has enjoyed for years. It tastes even better if you can plan ahead and let cake sit for about 3 days before cutting. The flavor intensifies.",

                "reviewBody": "I have been making this recipe for years and used to think my grandmother invented it until I found a very old newspaper clipping with the recipe at her house. I have given blackberry wine cakes as gifts served them at dinner parties and potlucks and it is always remembered long afterward. A few notes to help those of you having trouble with the glaze. My version has a half cup of butter melted on the stove with the sugar and wine stirred in and boiled together for a few minutes. Then while the cake is still in the pan poke a thousand (or so) holes in the bottom with a fork or skewer and pour about two-thirds of the glaze over it. Allow the cake to soak up the glaze for 30 minutes before turning it out onto a cake plate. Then reheat the remaining glaze and pour it over the top for color. Allowing the glaze to soak in makes this cake so moist you could literally leave it uncovered for days and it would not dry out. I have tried adding fresh blackberries to the glaze and to be honest it makes the cake look like a mess. If you really want the berries I would suggest adding them around the base of the cake after you are completely finished as a garnish. This is an especially good cake for folks who don't like icing. Don't be surprised when people cut 3\" wedges for themselves or when you catch yourself having some for breakfast!",

Good news for those who have a hard time finding blackberry gelatin Jello brand has started selling a \"Blackberry Fusion\" flavor (Summer '07) which is a mix of blackberry and raspberry. I used that and it turned out great! None of the stores in our area sell the Royal brand of gelatin so I was very happy to see Jello's new flavor. After reading many negative reviews for the glaze I opted to brush the warm cake with warmed blackberry preserves which added a nice flavor. Thanks for the delicious recipe!",
