The best thing to do is steam the vegetables in a steamer basket.  Put the carrots in first until they are about 3/4 of the way done, then add the pea pods to the steamer basket.  As soon as the pea pods are in, take a small sauce pan and make the glaze.  Usually the vegetables are ready right when I get the glaze finished.  Then just dump the vegetables into the sauce pan, stir lightly so you don't break apart the pea pods, and Voila!  I can't thank you enough for this wonderful recipe.  :-)",

I made it for the first time as a healthy lunch for myself.  2 carrots and 4 large handfuls of sugar snap peas were perfect.  I feel so healthy!!  I used enough butter to coat the bottom of the saucepan.  I didn't find the honey overpowering (I used 2 tablespoons as per recipe) but added some kick with 1 and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder in with the cornflour.  I sprinkled celery salt over the dish just before serving as well.  This is a great meal on its own!!",
