This technique will get rid of much of the starch that can make glue out of your potatoes. ALSO putting them through a hand held food mill OR a potato ricer makes quite a difference. I use SALTED butter and add extra salt and instead of pepper I use Mrs. Dash which will really add some pep to the dish. I usually Taste the potatoes up to 4 times adding seasoning until they are just right.",

My suggestion for the glue factor is to NOT put cold butter/whipping cream into your steaming hot potatoes. That along with over mixing will certainly cause them to \"seize\" up. I melt my butter in my cream and after it comes to a simmer I add it in. Thanks for the recipe! YUM!! (oh, and I added some salt as I used the reduced sodium chicken broth)",

Mash with a hand masher - add some reserved broth and finish stirring and mashing. If you don't have cream milk works just as well and saves you a few calories.",
