I wouldn't serve this as a Thanksgiving main dish or anything, but it was easy and filling.  Here are my critiques/additions:\n1. As another reviewer stated, CUT UP THE CHICKEN or use pre-cooked.  This took about 50 minutes to bake and I DID cut up chicken tenderloins.  \n2. Thaw the broccoli all the way (I did not, which may have contributed to #1....)\n3.  We added some bacon crumbles on top afterwards and it was AMAZING!  May try adding diced ham in with the chicken next time. \nOverall, good meal",
