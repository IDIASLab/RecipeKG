Letting the steaks sit on the counter for 2 hours can be dicey, depending on weather and kitchen conditions; I think 30-40 minutes is probably safe. Not everyone on this site is a professional chef and gets food safety. Frying for 3-4 minutes per side on a medium-hot cast iron and not touching it, moving it,  poking it, lifting it, or otherwise molesting it so it cooks and gets golden is key to medium rare and a beautiful steak. Honor your loved ones; serve them the best looking and tasting food! At the last minute of cooking time, adding a mixture of 1/4 tsp thyme, 1 minced clove fresh garlic and upping the butter to 1-1/2 tbsp, letting it melt into the pan, then spooning the butter over the cooked steaks, lifting the pan and swirling it around them as they stand in the pan for 3 minutes after cooking is complete (removed from the burner, but still in the cast iron pan) is the way to go. Let them stand covered in the pan for another 2 or 3 minutes while you plate up the sides and then serve right away.",

While the steaks were resting I saut\u00e9ed some sliced carrots in the drippings left in the skillet. perfection! Also, I wasn't able to get the steaks 2 days ahead, so I salted them this morning, about 10 hours ahead of cooking and let them sit on the counter 2 hours before cooking. I have 2 preschoolers, so I let their steak go an extra 2 minutes in the skillet. ours were medium well following the recipe and the kids' was between that and well done. My husband is a steak guy all around and said it was the best steak he had ever had. Thanks for making me a success tonight! :)",

Good job to the original poster of this recipe for getting it out there that less is more and a steak sometimes has WAY more flavor with good ol\u2019 salt and pepper and always butter! Just to be clear here because I read the reviews on this recipe, the instructions never said to leave the meat out for 2 hours or frankly any longer  than \u201c30 minutes prior to cooking\u201d - you\u2019ll always get good flavor with brine/seasoning/marinating THEN refrigerating! If too salty, just use less salt next time! I prefer to finish my ribeyes in the oven after a good browning on both sides (usually 3-4 mins MAX) and occasionally like to add rosemary sprigs on top when butter is melting :)",
