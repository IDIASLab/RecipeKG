The only recomendation that I would have would be to try adding some cayenne to the coating - it definately adds a zip to them. Also one reviewer mentioned that the coating was \"thin\" - that is a good thing!! That is how they are suppose to be so that you can taste the tomato! Try dipping these in buttermilk ranch dressing - sooo good - but not diet friendly:(",

Everyone that I have ever made these for raved over them and during the months when tomatoes are in over abundance I make these often.
