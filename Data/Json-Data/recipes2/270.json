I roasted the pack on the grill over medium heat turning every 5 minutes, for 15 minutes. I also thinly sliced the garlic knowing they would toast nicely in the olive oil. I transferred the contents into a medium bowl then added the lemon juice, additional oil, and cheese; pre-grated Romano in the green plastic shaker, but that did the trick. Fantastic!",

I like cooking it a few extra minutes because I love the crunchy dark parts that form on the broccoli- delish! I usually just do a quick once over sprinkling of lemon juice once done, not a lot,  and use the fancy shredded Parmesan cheese. You won't be disappointed!",
