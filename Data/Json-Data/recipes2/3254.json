It tastes great cold marinated or baked as a side dish.We baked at 400 F for 20 min to soften the carrots. we dont always use feta cheese but it still tastes great either way. If you can squeeze the juice a fresh lemon it tastes best.  We used coin cut carrots and golden raisins which works well.",

I have made it twice now & added 1 tablespoon each of cider vinegar &  sugar & a bit of minced onion. Let it marinate overnight for sure & stir it up as often as you remember so that all the veggies get a good soaking in the delicious juices at the bottom. I like it just as well without the feta & don't feel like it's missing anything. This one is a keeper. Thanks BFR610!",
