The fish already had enough moisture for the coating to stick to. I recommend seasoning the fish in some manner (eg salt and pepper or Adobo) before adding the coating. Doing so enhances the overall flavor. Also this recipe creates a lot of cornmeal seasoning. Store some for later before using the rest to coat the fish or else you'll be throwing away alot of excess cornmeal seasoning mix. Regarding concerns on cooking thick pieces of fish I used a cast iron skillet which holds and distributes heat well. You can turn down the heat to slow down the cooking if needed. Thanks for the delicious recipe!",

The garlic tends to burn easily and the fish really doesn't need it; but if you want that flavor use some garlic powder in the seasoning. The seasonings listed aren't bad at all but cajun seasoning is even better. Whatever seasoning you use use it directly on the fish. It gives it awesome flavor. Lightly coat the fish in flour before dipping in milk too. It helps attach the crust to the fish a little better. And as a matter of personal taste split the cornmeal with half flour. I think it makes for a more cohesive crust. The salt is not listed on the ingredients list but it is essential. Make sure not to miss it!",
