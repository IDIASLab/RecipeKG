Also to make your sauce thicker reduce the 35% cream by SIMMERING it for about 8 minutes and add 2 minutes for each stage thicker. also be aware that you can add other seasonings for extra flavours ie. lemon sage thyme and add fresh mushrooms to the sauce but 1rst saute them slightly.",

I made the chicken ala cream recipe (see reviews) and decided to go ahead and make this one since they were very similar. Very very good and I have decided to serve this at my Italian wine tasting party next week. It went very well with some Italian wines I opened tonight -- think it must have been the rosemary flavor which is dominant. It was great to finally have a recipe where I could use my pink and green peppercorns.",

I cooked the chicken in a skillet that I sprayed with a little butter flavored cooking spray no butter. When I removed the chicken I melted 1 tablespoon reduced fat butter in the skillet and added a little bit of flour to make a roux (sp???). To this I added 1 cup skim milk the garlic and fresh rosemary. After it had cooked down I added some chicken broth (I let the liquid get too low) and cooked it down a little more. Served the chicken and sauce over white rice with steamed broccoli - yum!",

This is very easy and quick and would probably impress your guests. I'll make this again. Thank you GS!",
