I don't think so. I used the 1/2 can condensed milk that I had and the close to 2 cups coconut I had and it needed more coconut to hold together, but I don't care how it looks so am eating it by the fingerful! But someone needs to fix the ingredients for less than 12 servings! It would have been soup!",
