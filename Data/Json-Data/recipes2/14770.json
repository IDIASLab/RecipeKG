Definitely double the amt of sauce - it's delicious! Only use 1/2 the amt of onion soup mix.  I will definitely make this again - i'm thinking about using a larger package of assorted chicken pieces next time. Marinate for at least a few hours.  Cook for 2x the amt of time called for in recipe to get meat very tender and get the sauce to a nice reduced consistency.  Add the apricots in for at least the last 1/2 hour so they get a bit mushy with the sauce.\r\n",

If you are an onion fan I would recommend you add a bit more onion soup mix than apricot nectar. The apricot flavor is very tangy and will not be drained out by the addition of more onion. Instead of drained apricot halves I used an apricot puree. I also allowed the chicken to marinate for 3 hours although overnight would probably provide even greater results. Clever recipe.. clever taste!",

Marinated 3 hours in one pkg of onion soup mix and two cans of apricot nector (because we use generous amts of sauce when having sticky white rice). The dish was bland in overall flavour; which was limited to 'the first bite:' The chicken (meat) itself wasn't very flavourful either. Next time I try this recipe I'll also add brown sugar/or apricot jam fresh sliced ginger root and maybe a bit of chopped garlic to the marinade. Will use a vacuum food bag sealer to marinate (so marinade is pulled into the meat) instead of marinating in a bowl for a few hours.",
