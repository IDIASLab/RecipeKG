I added more cheese a little salt and thickened with additional flour (all may just be personal preference). This has a nice cheesy flavor but then that layer of apple flavor follows and finally a little zing from the dash of the hot sauce is in the background. This would be a nice to serve as an appetizer soup for Thanksgiving. chrisdwilliams we enjoyed your recipe it's a keeper!",

I think probably the apples should be cooked separately so that you can mix the cheese into the roux rather than melting it into the hot liquidy soup. I didn't do that this time and regret it because the texture wasn't what I think it could be. Tasted fine though if a bit thinner than I'd like. I think I'd cut back on some of the liquid in the future to thicken it up a bit. Served it with crusty rolls and sides of roasted broccoli (which tasted great as a soup topper too!)

I had no dry mustard so I substituted 2 tsp. of prepared Dijon mustard. I thought it needed a little something so I garnished the soup with crisp bacon. That gave it some saltiness an texture. It was well received by my family.",
