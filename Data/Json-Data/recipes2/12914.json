They'll be in our Christmas candy lineup  from now on and probably many other occasions as well.  :)  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I accidentally ground a larger amount of pecans than called for, but the excess amount exactly matched the amount of required almonds so it seemed like a no brainer to use all pecans instead. I used a 70% cocoa Smooth Dark Lindt bar for my dipping chocolate.  It took a a bit longer to set up than almond bark, but the results were worth it. Thanks for sharing this great recipe Michele!",

I accidentally doubled the Greek yogurt that I used for the sour cream and had to add more of the cookies, nuts, baileys, etc. I kept them for a few days in the fridge before making the balls and freezing them. The dipping (my first attempt ever) went better than expected. I only had trouble when I tried to streamline it and toss a few balls at a time in the chocolate. Of course, they started to melt, so I went back to one at a time. They hardened pretty fast and I was able to \"patch\" any holes by dabbing my spoon of chocolate on them. I used homemade vanilla wafers and this worked out fine. I could only find semi-sweet chocolate for dipping but it was still good. We love dark chocolate so I was disappointed that I wasn't able to use it, but will find it for next time. I made half a batch (until the mistake) and used about a pound of almond bark for dipping. There was some left over but I had nothing else to dip so used it up by stirring in some cashews and dropping by spoonfuls to make nut clusters. :)",
