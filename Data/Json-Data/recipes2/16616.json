I also enthusiatically patted the sandwiches with paper towel before we ate them. They really were delicious but I would not feel good about eating them more than once every 2 months.... If you're going to make them use the strongest cheese you can find. If you're going to load up on calories you might as well be able to taste them....",

I still have a difficult time eating much because of no appetite. So my doctors' goal now is to get me to take in protein to build my muscle mass back up. I saw this recipe and added a slice of ham to it. I then soaked my single sandwich in an egg with milk until it was fully absorbed. Then I coated it with the breadcrumbs. Deep frying adds unnecessary calories. All that's needed is a thin coating of oil in a skillet and I fried it until golden on both sides then blotted on a paper towel. For many the relatively high caloric content might pose a problem but for me it was just perfect. Although I could only manage half of this filling sandwich it was excellent! The soft egg-soaked bread contrasts with the crispy exterior. I used a slice of Jarlsberg and a slice of American with a slice of ham in between. The meal had a nice high protein content with 2 slices of cheese ham milk and an egg. I'm going to try to reheat the rest later. I'm sure adding a couple of salted tomato slices would make this even more delicious. Thank you for posting this yummy vehicle for regaining my strength. Edited to add: Although it's impossible to retain the crispy exterior when reheated in the microwave it was still tasty a few hours later on.",
