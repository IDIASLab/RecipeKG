I made a lite version: I used 1/2 fat French vanilla ice cream Silk nog (non dairy eggnog) along with a caffeine free coffee and lite whipped cream spray. I forgot to add the nutmeg. I tried it the next time with nutmeg and it was much better without it. I used room temperature instead of hot coffee. I mixed the coffee and cold eggnog and then put the ice cream on top and whipped cream. Coffee punch should be cold in my opinion! Thank you I will make this every winter and plan another drink this week.",
