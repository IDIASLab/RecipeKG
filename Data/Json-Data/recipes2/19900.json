I will definitely make it again.",

I left out all those vegetables - so much fuss! - but I did opt to throw in some bacon, which I love in anything.  Also, the seasonings seemed a bit much, so I omitted those as well.  Instead of the noodles I went with a pre-baked pie crust, which of course made more sense in a pie plate rather than the 9x13 baking pan that was called for.  45 minutes to 1 hour seems like too much baking time; mine looked perfect after only 35 minutes.  My family raved about it!  Although, for some reason they thought the garlic bread I made didn't go with it.",
