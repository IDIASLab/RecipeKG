By that I mean they are just generally inspirational and I take it from there but this recipe looked awesome healthy and it sounded really easy to make so I followed it verbatim. the only thing I couldn't accomplish was that i could't find the particular Genoa salami suggested. I bought a quality Genoa Salami but didn't have the exact item. My result looked almost exactly like the recipe as pictured. My family said that this was \"bland\" and in fact I agree. I think it needs some texture - other than the Salami which really turned out to be dry (maybe it was because I had the wrong kind?). The other problem was that the tomatoes really withered away too much...I thought it seemed soon but in retrospect I am certain that I should have waited until just before adding the Spinach - maybe 60 seconds before tossing in the Spinach? I love these ingredients (except the Salami...). If I do it again I will probably toss in some crumbled bacon for taste and texture. I think this is a pretty healthy dish - fresh mushrooms tomatoes scallops and Spinach... hard to beat. It all came together really easily but I need to toss in something for texture and spice. Maybe other folks who are better cooks that I am will add some ideas. I will check back in a few months and see if some folks have ideas. thanks for posting tho!",
