                "reviewBody": "5-28-2016 There is no perfect way for me to rate this recipe. As its first reviewer I m glad I can warn that the preparation of it requires a drastic change and if that change is made this potato salad really is quite nice. If the change is not made however the recipe would be a disaster. The ingredients for the dressing as well as the herb add-ins are all great additions and work well together; but they only work when used in reasonable amounts. The amounts called for in this recipe are enough for at least twice if not three times as many potatoes as called for. First the potatoes never absorbed all of the broth/wine mixture so I ultimately drained the remainder off. I prepared the dressing chopped the herbs and (I should have known better to begin with!) found I had WAY too much of both. A fix would have been to boil more potatoes but that would only have been further waste since this was just for the two of us. It is a mystery to me frankly that whoever wrote and/or tested this recipe thought everything was proportional for the amount of potatoes directed. I can only wonder if the amount of potatoes is a typo and should have been written calling for twice (or even three times) as much. Thankfully I only used enough of the dressing and the herbs as I felt was appropriate and the resulting potato salad actually was pretty good. Now what to do with a bunch of excess chopped herbs and quite a bit of vinaigrette prepared with pricey olive oil",
