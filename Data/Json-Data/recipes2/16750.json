I ended up cooking the tofu for almost a half an hour before I was satisfied with how done it was; it doesn't take long to actually cook the tofu but I like it crispy. Also I added a couple of teaspoons of rice-vinegar to the sauce because I thought it was a bit too sweet and that gave it a slightly tangy taste. Overall it was a big hit with vegetarians and carnivores alike at a dinner party.",

The soft-but-cooked tofu gave it just enough liquid to make it a little creamy. My kids kept marveling at how soft the \"chicken\" was! We found it a bit spicy; next time I'll reduce the amount of old bay. But otherwise it was great.",
