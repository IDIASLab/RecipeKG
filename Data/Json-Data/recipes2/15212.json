I melted 1/2 cup of butter with garlic powder and extra Worchestershire sauce and added it to cereal. I also added more curry powder. I mixed everything like crazy and baked it in oven. It came out great! It had really needed that butter. I just used double the amounts on the Worchestershire curry and garlic powder. Next time I will use double of everything and add half cup butter with it until it all boils.",
