Usually a side dish for this Cuban dish is Yuca fried plaintains black beans or a Cuban tamale which is different than a Mexican tamale. If you don't think it has enough flavor you can alway add more spices to it. I usually put some Tony Chachere's seasoning or chopped up jalopenos or cilantro in my Picadillo to give it a little flavor.",

Sadly the leftovers went into the trash. Supper ended up being Mexican Rice II and chips. I do recommend Mexican Rice II. Restaurant quality! N R",

It is really really good and a different way to use ground beef (which is always a challange for me) I think this could be salty for some folks and I omited the garlic salt and doubled the garlic powder. I had to make my own adobo seasoning and I think next time I would omit the salt out of that. The olive brine gives this plenty of salty flavor. After putting the tomatoe sauce in and looking at the meat mixture I decided to give up on putting it in a tortilla and making rice instead. My daughter thought it was tasty and she is the picky one. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Oh one more thing I halved the recipe for 1lb of ground beef but noticed that the recipe did not make an exception for the amount of tomatoe sauce. Using a 28oz can of tomatoe sauce with 1lb of ground beef would have made soup. N R",
