I started experimenting with ground chicken in my burgers and was mildly surprised with the outcome. The family likes these better than beef burgers! I usually make this when I bring the chicken home from the market.  It makes for a quick meal on a weeknight. It just doesn't get any easier! These are served on Belle's&reg; Hamburger Rolls which are totally off the hook!",

Ground chicken is a much wetter consistency than beef or turkey. We have had these with toppings of cheddar cheese and bacon extra pineapple slices avocado and just tonight we tried the new Siracha Ketchup on the market. That was a winner! It doesn't hurt if you want to make a batch and freeze them....that's probably one of the easiest ways to handle them however I've made them so much that I find it's just easier to keep my hands wet. Hope these hints help....enjoy!",
