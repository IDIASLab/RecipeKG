Try adding a couple of tablespoons of whole kernel corn.  Super easy to make, kids can do it too! Tender noodles coupled with subtle chicken broth, all with succulent pieces of chicken, exotic shitake mushrooms and a slow-simmered egg ... my favorite rainy-day meal!",

The only complaint I have with this soup is that it only said to slice the mushrooms when indded the stems should really have been removed. I had never had shiitake mushrooms and have since learned that the stems are tough and rubbery and I will definitely remove them the next time I make this.",
