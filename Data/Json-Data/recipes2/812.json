In the same pan, I saut\u00e9 the bell peppers (generally red and green) and 1/2 cup of sliced green onions, adding the halved cherry tomatoes for the last minute or so. To this mixture I add the shrimp, pasta, salt, pepper , parsley, lemon zest, and maybe another tablespoon of lemon juice. Cook until thoroughly heated and serve.
