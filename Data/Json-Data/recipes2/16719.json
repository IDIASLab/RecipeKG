I will make this again but I think next time I will leave out the oats to see if that makes a more firm burger-like texture.",

For those of you who had trouble keeping the burgers together try whirring the oatmeal in the food processor/mini-chopper for a few seconds to make them more like flour. The benefit of oatmeal is that it assumes the taste of the meat rather than adding its own flavor.",
