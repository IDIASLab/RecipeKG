I left the rest of the ingredients as written. I used what I already had but I wish I had had a not-so-sweet bbq sauce. The sweet factor was a little too much with the sweet sauce and the sweet Hawaiian Roll. Next time I make these they would be nice with a hickory smoked bbq sauce. I also think I would prefer the onions cooked in rings rather than diced but that is just personal preference. The one thing missing from the recipe is salt. That is a needed ingredient.",
