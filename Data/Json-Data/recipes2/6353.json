The mustard and ginger are great compliments to the flavor of the salmon without being too over-powering. I used whipped cream cheese so it was easier to stir and stuff the salmon.

Last few times my salmon was fairly thin so I just took the stuffing and spread it on top instead. This way you can spread it out and every bite has some of the mixture. If you feel it's too much you can easily scrape it off. I was hesitant about using the sesame seeds but they really compliment the dish. Will definitely make again!",
