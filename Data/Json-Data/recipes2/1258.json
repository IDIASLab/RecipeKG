I used a can of Trader Joe's light coconut milk in place of the soy milk used Fage plain Greek yogurt in place of the tofu juiced 2 cups each of pineapple and cantaloupe juiced 1/2 a lime and substituted organic agave syrup for the coconut flavoring because I used coconut milk. I blended all ingredients in a pitcher and poured into a dozen large Popsicle molds for \"juice bars\". Oh my goodness- this has become my favorite way to get cantaloupe into my diet! Such a delicious tropical frozen treat for hot summer days! My 14-year-old (who hates coconut ANYTHING) said these were her favorite Popsicles I've made and requested more!",
