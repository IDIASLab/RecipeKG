It was easy, especially with a hand blender which I used to blend all the cauliflower.

I will definitely make it again!  I may try adding potatoes for a heartier soup and perhaps experiment with other seasonings to add body. I think that the kind of ham used and how it was cooked will also change the flavor a bit.",

I cooked the cauliflower in the broth then pureed it in batches with some of the broth that it cooked in. I did add two very large organic chopped red peppers and one very large organic chopped zucchini and four cloves of garlic. I really wanted a little extra veggies in my soup to make it a little heartier and not just cauliflower-flavored. What I did was while I was pureeing the cauliflower and the broth I sauteed the onion pepper zucchini and garlic in the EVOO (I did need a little more) in my soup pot and once they were ready I just added the cauliflower puree and a little of the excess broth. I then added in the ham and the cheese. (I only used about 3/4 cup or so. Not much.) After tasting it I did add about a teaspoon of red pepper flake. This really almost seems like a potato soup. That's what I love about cauliflower soup. You puree it and it fools you into thinking that it's potato soup and you don't need the added milk or cream to get that creamy flavor/texture. This soup had a few steps but the end result was awesome.",

I was looking for a recipe to use up the leftover ham from Christmas however I don't care for the traditional ham and bean soup. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out absolutely delicious. p.s. a great time saver was using my submersible blender stick/wand to puree the cauliflower. I served the soup with Hawaiian bread (also from allrecipes.com)which was a perfect combination--the spicy kick of the soup with the sweetness of the pineapple in the bread. Thanks again for a great recipe",

I also needed to use up a few veggies that were in the fridge.  I sauteed the onion with celery, carrot, onion & garlic & 2 bay leaves.  Added 3 cans ckn broth & 1 can of veg broth.  Learned this from another recipe on this site.  Veg broth does make a difference.  Scored a smoked pork hock.  Put it in & simmered for 1 hour. Took the hock out.  Put the cauliflower & a lonely little diced zucchini in & simmered for a few minutes.  Put the immersion blender in for a few seconds. Not long.  I like to see the veggies in my soup. Added diced ham & meat from the hock.  Mixed 1/2 cup flour & milk & let it thicken.  Finally the potato  flakes. I will make this again. OH YUM!!!!! Also when you are adding the cheese do it a little at a time and keep stirring has it melts.  This way you won\"t have a cheese ball in your soup.  Enjoy",
