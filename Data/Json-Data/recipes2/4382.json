I figured I should give the recipe another chance and make some modifications and I think I'm going to make these yet again and modify them further.  \nThis time I used only 1 egg in the potatoes and did not dredge the potato pancakes in the flour and egg.  Simply rolling them in panko made them slightly easier to work with.  \nNext time I make these I'm going to skip the egg all together!  Unless you're making dry mashed potatoes (no milk and butter) there really is no need for the additional moisture from the egg.  Just add the flavourings, form and roll in the panko.  It doesn't need anything else.",
