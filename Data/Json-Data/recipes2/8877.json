I like something with strawberries or Asian pears and a glass of white wine. Make it a full meal by topping with a dry-spiced chicken breast (I like a hint of fish oil and garlic spice blends to make a nice rub.)",

Too spicy for me and didn't allow the flavors of the olives and capers to pop as much as I like. Maybe it's the brand I used though; I don't think we have the brand in our area that the recipe submitter mentioned. At any rate it was fun to try this dish--it's a take on puttanesca I haven't tried before. I don't think I'll make it again since I adore traditional puttanesca but it's a very nice recipe--thanks for sharing!",
