Just dribble it into the potatoes until you get the thickness that appeals to you. And while it's always a good idea to heat the milk before adding it to the potatoes I'm not sure I understand the necessity of boiling it. The reason I tried these potatoes had nothing to do with that however. It was all about the nutmeg. I've enjoyed the slightest hint of it in other savory dishes but never in potatoes and I was curious. While I won't make a habit of including nutmeg in my mashed potatoes I did enjoy the subtle hint of it here as well and was pleased I tried it (but Hubs not so much).",

Hubby loves them even more than my normal \"best ever\" so this is a true hit. Since making them the first time he has requested them over and over. Calls them \"Moe's Mashed\" says he has never tasted anything so delicious. Morgan thanks for posting.",
