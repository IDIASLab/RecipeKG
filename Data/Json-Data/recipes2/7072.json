Don't forget the crusty Italian bread for dipping! A traditional bruschetta goes well with this also. Although not included in recipe, you can add some cut green pepper with vegetables and throw in some sliced mushrooms for last 1/2 hour if you like. This is my recipe so feel free to make it yours.",
