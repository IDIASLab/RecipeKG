I made it twice this Christams the first time I used regular cream cheese and sour cream the second time with light cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream. It was just as good. bought french bread loaf and sliced and broiled it myself instead of using crackers. Made a difference. Also for christmas touch I layered the top with the cream cheese filling and then used the pesto to make a star on top. festive!",
