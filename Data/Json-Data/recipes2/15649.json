Unfortunately... well you know that cereal that Calvin (& Hobbes) likes to eat -- Chocolate-Frosted Sugar Bombs?? This recipe makes me think of that. It was \u00fcber-sweet. The cake alone is probably even too sweet but when you put this frosting on the top... wowzers! (in a bad way) I'd try a different frosting recipe and see how that goes. Or maybe just go with \"Strawberry Cake I\" or \"II\" here at Allrecipes.com instead. I'll try it again tonight with a cup of coffee and see if my opinion improves. I've also got guests here that might try it. Until then... no more sugar for the day............ OK I've been eating it with the frosting scraped off -- it's tolerable maybe even \"good\". But that hot-pinkness.... it looks a bit fakey. My guests said that most strawberry cakes are quite sweet but one did comment on the \"surprisingly powerful and welcome\" taste of strawberry.",
