I made a few modifications to the original recipe; more as a matter of what was available to me as opposed to taste preferences; those being the use of almond butter and a home made pepper sauce. It was a little disorienting in that it tasted a bit too much like warmed hummus as opposed to an actual burger. That being said; I really enjoy hummus so I also enjoyed the burger. It ended up being a bit too dry and I needed to add a little bit of water to keep the patty whole. The oat flavor was a little too strong for me Not sure if it would be better to add less of it or mask the oat flavor with another spice. I think the almond butter was a good choice over peanut butter as I think that the peanut butter may have been a bit too strong and the addition of hot sauce was a great idea. For me it's somewhere between 3 and 4 stars; with a bit more tweaking I'm pretty sure I can make it even better.",
