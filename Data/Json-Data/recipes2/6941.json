This one is particularly good and Hubs agrees - strawberries and mango are clearly a match made in heaven. Other than using strawberry yogurt rather than plain I did not add or omit any ingredients. I did however change the amounts of them using more fruit less yogurt. It was a happy accident that in an effort to use up this perishable fruit I came up with a smoothie that as Hubs put it was pleasantly less sour than most. The only problem was that it could have been colder. I wonder if my forgetting to include the ice cubes had anything to do with that.",

It's definitely not a sweet smoothie which is perfect for me because I don't like overly sweet things but others might want to add more honey or use a vanilla yogurt. I used Greek non-fat yogurt and the smoothie came out really smooth. This makes more like 2 servings instead of 4 unless you only like a really small glass.",
