I refuse to waste the onion-flavored lime juice - use it in another guac, in a Bloody Mary, in a salad dressing, or in an Indian mint/cilantro chutney!",

The mango flavor and texture blends very well with the rest of the ingredients. The ONLY thing I did differently was that I wanted to use my own peppers so I added some of my own dried to the onion and lime and let it rehydrate them. I didn't have any fresh peppers other than jalapeno and I didn't want to use those.:) Other than that I followed the recipe and won't change anything when I make it again! Thank you.",
