Due to grandma's inability to eat anything remotely spicy, I did not add the peppercorns or pepper.  I fried the squid in a layer of vegetable oil in a pan, rather than deep frying it.  My kids gobbled it up.  I cut the juvenile squid into 1/2 inch rings, left the tentacles as is, and tossed the whole thing into the mix of cornstarch, flour, and salt, which was in a ziplock bag.  After thoroughly shaking to coat everything, I poured the whole thing into a sieve and shook it until all the excess coating came off, sort of like panning for gold.  Then I dumped the whole thing into the pan.  I practically stir fried the squid, but the coating still stuck.  Then I placed the oily rings between paper towels.  The oil soaked up four layers of Bounty paper towels, even though it didn't look very greasy.  I will definitely be making this again.  Maybe it turned out so tender because the squid was so young--the bodies were no more than 5 inches long.  I can't wait to cook this without Grandma around so I can add some spices.",
