I had home-made linguine I had to use(I could manage the pasta but not the sauce go figure) and ended up putting the fresh basil over the warm pasta with olive oil and parm. That was brilliant. Except for the tomatoes I followed the recipe to a T. I am not sure what went wrong but it was inedible. Since I am in the minority I must assume it was my error however I really think the vermouth and tomato are a bad match. Perhaps a sweeter vermouth vs. extra dry (which I used)?",
