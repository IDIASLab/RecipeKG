(Frankly I don't think I would have cared for that either) Generally I don't add sweetener of any kind to most smoothies as he prefers them more tart than sweet. However I did today in keeping with the recipe but not nearly as much as called for - probably just a couple of teaspoons. This is so luxuriously creamy and smooth with such a pretty delicate peachy color. Hubs liked the tang of the yogurt and that the full flavor of the mango came through. He also called it pleasantly sweet. (I guess a little bit of added sweetener must be good!)",

I ended up giving it something (anythig) to give it some kind of bulk to it to make it last a few hours. I added a frozen banana some oatmeal more ice some flax and wheat germ and that seemed to do it for me. If it was not for the cardamom flavor this would not even have rated for me at all.",
