Also I didn't have cheddar crackers so I used \"Town House\" butter crackers. I did have to bake it a tad longer but very good! We really like this recipe alot. Thanks Mary Ann!!",

I have substituted both Cream of Celery and Cream of Chicken (when I didn't have mushroom in the pantry). Still tastes great. Also I used a white cheddar cracker (Cheese-it brand mostly) and prefer that over the cheddar cracker myself. I usually use the recommended 1-1/3 cups of milk but you might want to increase that if you prefer a creamier texture to your dish when finished baking. THANKS Mary Ann!!",
