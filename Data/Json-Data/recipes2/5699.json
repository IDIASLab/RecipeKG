Use lowest flame possible and continually move and adjust the height of the pan over the flame, wisking constantly.  DO NOT place pan directly down on the stove. Watch very carefully because it thickens quickly once up to temp. See Chef John's video on this open flame method on this site.  I personally like to use just one teaspoon of lemon juice.\n    For a quick b\u00e9arnaise sauce try adding a few drops of balsamic or red wine vinegar along with some tarragon, parsley, onion powder and fresh ground pepper.",

When you start to whisk you'll get a million lumps of butter but as soon as they melt, just keep going and you're good.\n\nThe main criticism I'd give is that \"low heat\" could mean anything.  Depending on your temperature, this might take 15 minutes.  IF IT \"DOESN'T THICKEN,\" it will.  Just keep going.  If it's still as juicy as at the start at the five minute mark, increase the heat just a tick, but not much.  And once it's thick, it won't separate.\n\n\"Real\" Hollandaise has bay, mince shallot, maybe parsley and thyme, and 50/50 mix of vinegar and water.  I actually like a \"fast\" way to make it as well.  But why not tear up a bay leaf and add it to the mix, along with some onion powder and white pepper if you have it.",
