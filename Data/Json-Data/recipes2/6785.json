I did add in a bit more seasoning than just cumin after tasting it just spice it up with your favorite seasonings. I used May Ploy chili sauce and a couple teaspoons of Sambel Oelek for added heat. Was a great marinade to pair with fruits and veggies. My eldest son wanted the marinade recipe....we all really liked it.",

I thought it definitely needed something acetic I added two tablespoons of rice vinegar and only one teaspoon oil. I used ths on chicken cutlets that hubs grilled to crispy perfection!

I was worried that the honey would make this too sweet but it wasn't. The chicken marinated for 2 days so it had plenty of flavor. I also made veggie kabobs with zucchini and onion and had fresh asparagus that DH grilled. I did as Lindsay the submitter suggested and saved part of the marinade to baste as we grilled and also used the marinade on the veggies. Remember to not use the marinade the meat soaked in but to save some \"clean\" marinade to baste with and to use on veggies. A nice selection last week.",
