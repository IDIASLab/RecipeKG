Like another reviewer I used some orange and yellow bell pepper. IMO it was probably a better choice. I recommend increasing the red curry paste to 1 T. It is the star of the dish and is the basis of the flavors. DO NOT SKIP THE FISH SAUCE. It adds depth and balance. If you cannot find it substitute some anchovy paste. I did not have any cilantro but hubs does not care for it anyway. The lime zest at the end paired with a squeeze of lime juice at serving time adds a beautiful finish. My side was Jasmine rice cooked in the remainder of the chicken broth I used for the curry. Next time I may serve this over cellophane noodles or udon noodles. Thanks Deb!!",
