In my humble opinion one cup of quinoa can easily handle 5 eggs maybe six. The amount of cheese in this one keeps everything together and works well to make up for only having 4 eggs. Perhaps that's just personal preference but we like our eggs around here and it is breakfast. Thank you for submitting this recipe.",

They are delicious! I altered the recipe to be more low fat by omitting the butter and cream. Instead I sprayed the pan with olive oil Pam and used skim milk. I also added an extra egg as the other reviewer suggested. The broccoli cooked perfectly. Next time I plan to try using 3 egg whites and 2 whole eggs to cut down on fat even further. My 9 year old is begging for me to make them again!",
