You need to add something to help flavor the chicken to the water...salt, pepper,celery,onion etc. A good recipe to try/look at for guidance is AR's for Boiled Chicken...just add salt.\nThe amount of pepper in the recipe should not be a pinch but it should be, fresh ground pepper, to taste. Some people like a lot (my dad) and others (my husband) not so much,lol\nI am also picky about the brand of Ranch Dressing I use as well, personally not all dressing's taste the same..we like Hidden Valley.\nIt's also good with a bit of shredded cheese mixed in too;)\nEnjoy!",
