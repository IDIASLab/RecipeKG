Also, A spoon nor my fingers were working for me so I put the filling in a ziplock baggie, then cut about a half inch off of the corner.  I then, basically, used it as a pastry bag to stuff the noodles.  worked wonderfully:)",

I bought regular cream cheese and spiced it heavily with basil, oragano, pesto, and 2 cloves of garlic. For those heay spice lovers, I judged whether it was enough by the smell. If it still smelled heavily of cream cheese, I added extra herbs. I also used a few pinches of thyme and one dash of cumin. \n\nI also added a blend of italian cheeses instead of just mozzerella, and used more than the reciepe called for in the mixture. I saved just enough to sprinkle on the top of the dish.  \n\nI also had enough to make 14 shells moderatly stuffed. \n\nThis made awesome left overs too! Next time I might try lean beef (the sausage ratio to cheese mixture was a bit high), and reduced fat cream cheese as I don't want the flavor or the fat of it, but I do want the richness. \n\nThanks for sharing!",
