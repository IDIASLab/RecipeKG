I think if I decide to make this again I will use broth to cook the stuffing instead of water per the box directions and then I will also add much more seasonings to my bread crumbs (even more than the seasoned bread crumbs come with) such as Tony Cachere's cajun seasoning to give it more kick. I did add a bit of garlic salt which helped but not enough. I sprinkled the top with dried parsley when I put on the final cheese slices which made a pretty presentation. I also butterflied my chicken breasts and pounded it out a bit to make it easier to roll (and prettier when cut open). Definitely need to add more umph though!",

My daughters (ages 6 and 3) had a blast helping me pound the chicken breasts. The only change I made was to use monteray jack cheese because that's what I had on hand. I also topped the chicken with the slices before putting it in the oven (because I forgot to wait). It still turned out great! All the kids loved it. It actually turned out quite well and looked very pretty. My children were impressed they said it was like eating at a nice restaurant.",
