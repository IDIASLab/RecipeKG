I used Pillsbury Crescent Roll dough (regular size not Grands). When you unroll the dough the dough will be perforated... you will see 4 large rectangles with each rectangle divided into 2 triangles. Ignore the triangles... break the dough into the 4 large rectangles. Then with the knife cut each rectangle in half leaving you with 2 squares for each rectangle (for a total of 8 squares. Put the mushroom filling in the middle of the square (which will still have perforations - squeeze this together to keep the turnover from breaking apart). Just fold the square so it's corner to corner into triangles and press with the prongs of a fork to keep closed. Best when dough is very cold = much easier to work with. I hope this makes sense!!",

I prefer using phyllo dough which is much flakier and lighter and MUCH easier to use than the crescent rolls. You can buy pre-made frozen phyllo dough cups-- they are about the size of a miniature Reeses peanut butter cup (a perfect size for an appetizer.) Also try adding 1/2 a package of Boursin Garlic and Fine Herb cheese after the mushrooms have cooked. Sometimes I make half of this recipe as directed and half with Boursin and the appetizers with the Boursin always go first.",

I used an 8oz package of mushrooms instead of minced onion I chopped up a green onion and added that to the pan with the butter and mushrooms along with 1 teasp minced garlic.. When filling the crescents do them one at a time because once the hot mushroom filling gets on them they get soggy.. So spoon some filling on one square and fold it right away then move to the next one.. On top of the mushroom mixture before folding I topped it off with a mixture of Parmesan and Mozarella cheese... Dont worry if they wont fold into a perfect triangle I found that any shape is delicious..LOL.. I didnt have any sesame seeds so I couldnt add those but they were GREAT without them.. I will be adding these to my Superbowl Appetizer trays.. Kiki (Brampton On Canada)",

It makes the filling easier to fit into the triangle. Also I used a fork to crimp the edges together all the way around the triangles to provide a uniform and decorative look plus keep the filling from coming out. Finally I used black sesame seeds or poppy seeds on the top for a contrasting color which made these seem fancier. An eggwash can help these to stick and make your dough brown better and shine. You can use puff pastery instead of crescent roll dough if you like. Personally I found phyllo dough to be too dry...",
