Halfway through my first arepa, one stuffed with black beans, beef, plantains, and salty cheese, I vowed to learn how to make these at home. It's a truly magnificent delivery system for any number of your favorite fillings. I went with some spicy pork and avocado, but I made a version a few days later stuffed with caramelized plantains and salty goat feta.",

You grab a handful of dough and roll it around in your hand until it is a smooth ball (the heat of the hands helps to get rid of rough edges). Then you slowly pat the ball  until it is evenly flat, not too thick or thin. Adding Parmesan cheese to the dough adds a nice touch, but I find simple is better. You can also make thick oven Arepas by heating  the Arepas in a pan lightly greased until it has a bit of a shell, then pop in oven until it  is cooked through and looks a little flaky, cooking time varies depending on size and how long they were in the pan, you can also skip the pan step. =)",
