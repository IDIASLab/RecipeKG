I used pink lemonade. I lessened the amount of lemonade and added a bit more OJ. In addition to the orange slices we added some fresh orange peel strings with a zester. Rather than the ginger ale we replaced it with 50/50 (sour soda) so it wouldn't be too sweet. The fun part was adding some small ice molds using mini bundt pans and froze white cranberry juice fresh cranberries orange zest and an orange slice in each one. It was very festive and overall a great recipe to use!!",
