Lil Snoo this is some good soup!:) Changes were slight because ran out: only 1/4c onion okay maybe a third cup; 2 1/2c chicken broth; 2/3c heavy cream. Since I can't go through a can of chipotle peppers quickly I puree the contents & freeze by Ts. I used 3T which would be more than two peppers. I'll try 2Ts or actual peppers & sauce. next time. Too hot for some but with it being smokey & creamy too; not me.:) It's some good soup. 'Not super rich but still creamy. Nice-warm-up soup! A big one for me is that it isn't too tomatoey. I don't care for cream of tomato soup. This is spicy soup with tomatoes & cream. Bueno!:D 'Only way to improve might be adding fresh cilantro or tortilla strips as she suggested. Oh oh oh! I didn't have the fire-roasted so added 1/8t liquid smoke & 1/4t granulated garlic to regular diced toms.",

I thought the spice was perfect I added some sour cream to my son's to cool it down. If you are not a huge fan of chipotle and spicy things you may wan to cut the amount of peppers down to one or maybe even just the adobo. Otherwise I made this exactly as written and it turned out perfectly. I crumbled tortilla chips into it but a grilled cheese would have been better!",
