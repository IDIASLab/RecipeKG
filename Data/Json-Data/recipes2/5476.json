I didn't measure the celery--just chopped up one rib. Also didn't measure the onion just chopped two green onions. I had to use some dried dill since I didn't have fresh. I squeezed some fresh lemon juice right into the tuna salad and didn't add any kosher salt. Thanks for a wonderful lunch! I will try this again.",
