I boil the little potatoes, use fresh cherry tomatoes, canned green beans, marinated artichoke hearts, and whatever I have in the refrigerator. The one constant is the dressing which I really love. I do doctor it up a little bit as well by adding some minced garlic. I make the dressing at least two hours before making the rest of the salad so the garlic is infused into the dressing.",

For authenticity and the right melding-without-mixing, plate all items on a platter and serve family style as the recipe states. I suggest plating and serving when the potatoes and green beans are still plenty warm, but not piping hot. The mixture of warm and cold ingredients is part of the deliciousness of this dish. (Personal preference, I do give the eggs some time to cool completely because I find warm hard boiled eggs unappetizing.) The only change I made was to use fresh grape tomatoes instead of sun-dried since I prefer them. Larger tomatoes might taste even better since they\u2019d lend their acidity to the other ingredients more readily, but wouldn\u2019t plate well so I haven\u2019t tried them yet. I use Simply Potatoes 12oz bag of chopped potatoes, prepared on the stovetop per the bag instructions, except cooked to golden so a bit longer than instructed. This makes this an extremely fast weeknight dish to prepare. My two-year-old loves to help with this because he can easily prepare the dressing and plate the ingredients in fun different ways each time. My husband has started requesting this bi-weekly. Total win.",
