I used Panko breadcrumbs, and could see using the Italian Panko, as well.  I enjoyed this for lunch today and absolutely would enjoy this as a healthy side dish but, also, wouldn't hesitate to cut the zucchini into chunks, stick a toothpick in it, and serve as an appetizer.  Honestly, this recipe exceeded my expectations!!",

Also accidentally used a teaspoon instead of a tablespoon to measure everything out, but it turned out to be the perfect amount to top off one whole zucchini. Cooked in my air fryer at the recommended 180 degrees for 15 min. Tasted great with ranch sauce and served alongside breaded chicken tenders (also cooked in the air fryer)! Yumm!",
