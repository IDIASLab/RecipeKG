I baked it in a pie plate and served it with corn chips. People were also using crackers to eat it too. I wonder if this would work in a fondue pot. That way it would stay warm thoughtout the whole party. The hostess microwaved the dish when it became room temp because everyone liked it hot. Enjoy!",
