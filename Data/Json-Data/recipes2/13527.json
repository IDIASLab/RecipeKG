I didn't blend the celery well enough and the soup was entirely too watery which may have been because I refused to add the rind and in getting rid of the rind I lost a bit of cheese. Despite all this it ended up being -really- good which is where all the stars come in. My mom tried it and commented that it seemed unflavorful while my uncle said he liked it. I myself find myself wanting more right now. Imagine how good it would taste if it made it RIGHT! So I intend to make this again properly and then to write a better informed review",

I tried it with less cream the first time because I was afraid it would be heavy due to the amount of fat in the brie but it turned out to be lighter than expected. The second and third time I used the whole amount as instructed and in fact it was lighter than a usual \"cream of vegetable\" soup. The first time I used a popular industrial brand of brie and it was somewhat bland and somewhat bitter. In my next attempts I used a local organic brand and found it much tastier and less bitter. The third time I added a large bunch of fresh spinach when saut\u00e9ing the onions and celery and it is to die for! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe. I would never have thought of this on my own.",
