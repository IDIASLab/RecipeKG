I baked mine for about 20 mins. or so, and that was plenty, so keep an eye out. The combo of the peaches and toasted marshmallows work really, really well together. The kids tore this up! This was great for an easy dessert or even just when you want something sweet that's quick and more on the healthy side. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)",
