I don't have an ice cream scoop so I measured it out with a food portion scoop I got at Sam's Club. I used 1/2 the amount of liqueur of both suggested and it was still plenty strong. It looked like a thick milk so I added 6 ice cubes to make it truly frothy. It would have also looked plain so I added lite whipped cream on top and a ground almond to each cup. I will make this again with the tweaks. With the tweaks it was a 5 star drink. Ty for the idea I love toasted almond frozen drinks.",

One tip though you may have to play around a little bit with the amounts of each ingredient. I like the alcohol taste to be a little more subtle and the shake to be a bit thicker so I lessen the amount of milk and alcohol but you may be different. Try it you are sure to like it.",
