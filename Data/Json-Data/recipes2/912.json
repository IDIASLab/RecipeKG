I have tried many other spinach dip recipes from this website, but felt like something was missing or they were too \"Alfredo-ey.\" So I modified the recipes I found to eliminate the Alfredo sauce and substituted in the cheeses I had on hand. Voila! A delicious recipe that I felt proud to share with my fellow cooks. Serve with chips or veggies. I hope you enjoy!",
