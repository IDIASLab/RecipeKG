The flavor is rich without being too overwhelming. I enjoyed the richness of the tamari sauce. I thought I had peanut oil when I started but did not so I used sesame oil to brown the chicken. I also lightly drizzled some sesame oil on the pasta too which my wife also enjoyed. All in all a nice stir-fry recipe when you don't want the same bland stir-fry.",

What I did: sauteed 1 clove of chopped garlic in olive oil & butter, added 2 chicken breasts (sliced in thin strips) and cooked until no pink showed. Pushed chicken to outer edges of pan and added onion, carrot, celery, mushrooms, and red pepper to center of pan (what was on hand). Topped with 1 1/2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of OJ concentrate, 1/4 tsp. ground ginger, salt & fresh ground pepper. Covered & cooked until vegis done, stirring occasionally. Juiced 1/4 lemon and sprinkled over all. Stirred and served over wheat noodles. Will try rice next time. Thanks for a great recipe!",
