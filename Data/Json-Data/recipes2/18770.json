I had to make a few changes for example my Christmas budget didn't allow for paying 6 for the fresh herbs so I used fresh basil only which I'd bought for another recipe. Also I mxed the cheeses in with the tomatoes and let it all marinate for a few hours. Lastly I pre-toasted the bread so it didn't get soggy and then broiled the assembled bruschettas for about 3 or 4 minutes until the cheese just barely started to melt and the edges of the bread got nice and brown. These are delicous and best of all even at room temp they are great.",
