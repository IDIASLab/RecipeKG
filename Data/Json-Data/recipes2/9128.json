That sounded like a more robust flavoring vs boiling out all the lovely texture, and we love Brussels Sprouts! I added extra hot sauce and maybe only 4 oz dressing before letting it rest in the fridge. I double checked the bag of sprouts to make sure it was a pound....because the ammount of dressing called for would be over-kill for us. Cherry tomatoes, fresh Parmesan,  green onion, seasoned croutons, balsamic reduction, blue cheese,  toasted almonds....so many toppings to choose from to make this special for any main dish!",
