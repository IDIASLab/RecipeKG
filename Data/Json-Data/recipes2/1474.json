We really enjoyed the flavor and texture of this dish. I omitted the basil altogether (no one here really cares for it) and gave the kids the option of Monterey Jack or Cheddar cheese. I also laid the tomato and bacon out in bowls so that everyone could pick and choose their toppings. I think it all went great together but the rest of the household liked it minus the tomatoes. Great dish and perfect for cooking with the slow cooker liners:)",

We don't eat a lot of meat so I left out the bacon. To give it a bit more \"oomph\" however I added in some squash to give it some more substance. My tomatoes were done for the season so I didn't' get to top it with those but my husband loved it and ate it with a grilled cheese sandwich for a twist of soup and sandwich. It made the house smell lovely and of course anything in the slow cooker makes me happy. Great fall (or anytime really) recipe! Also since it's just the two of use I halved the recipe and had plenty for leftover lunches. Yum!",
