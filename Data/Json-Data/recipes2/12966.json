It is a typical example of Greek cuisine where a few simple ingredients are turned into an utterly delicious dish with little effort. It can be served as a main course. With olive oil as the only source of fat it is a quintessential example of the Mediterranean diet, and it is vegan to boot. If preferred, serve with a hearty chunk of feta on the side.",

However, I actually made a mistake and cut EGGPLANT instead of zucchini.  (Don't ask....giggle!!!!)  Anyway, as I didn't have anything else immediately planned for the eggplant, I decided to include it in my ingredients.  I used less zucchini as a result and crossed my fingers that the eggplant would not adversely affect the end result.  OH MY GOSH....it was sooooooooooo good!  I plan to always include the eggplant along with the zucchini.  \n\nThis is truly a very satisfying dish and my husband LOVED it!  Main dish or as a side....this is a recipe to keep handy!!!",
