Follow the recipe's suggestion of making the punch in small batches because people really preferred the punch while it was very fizzy. The fizz lasts maybe 5 minutes and after that the taste does not change but the presentation does. To make the small batches I mixed the thawed juice concentrates together and then divided them into small Ziplock bags. I also used a melon ball scoop to make small balls of raspberry sorbet which I also put into small Ziplock bags. Lastly I divided up the ice cubes into small bags. Doing so made the punch-making process quick easy and clean as I only had to open up one bag of concentrate sorbet and ice cubes per punch bowl and then pour soda on top. Even if you don't follow all of my suggestions I highly recommend that you at least divide up the juice concentrate as it will stain and you don't want that problem!! By the way these servings are small and are made to fit small punch glasses. Expect to use three or four of these servings per adult.",
