(the recipe says to add the chocolate to the cream) And I added a teaspoon of sugar to the cream before whipping. Whipped till soft peaks formed and then melted the chocolate in the microwave at 45 second intervals. Put a big dallop of whipped cream into the chocolate and fold in (this should temper the chocolate instead of shocking it and making it chunky) add more spoonfuls of cream gently folding until it's all incorporated. Hopefully that will provide a better consistency for everyone that's having trouble getting it smooth.",

I altered only slightly using semisweet chocolate chips (melted in microwave), I added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar to the cream. After adding the chocolate (still warm)to the cream, I re-whipped for approx. 2-3 min. I topped off with a thin layer of whipped cream, and threw on a marachino cherry cut in half (rinsed in cold water to prevent bleeding). I had a to hide these in the fridge while they set!

In the meantime I chilled the bowl and whisk I was going to use to whip the cream. DON'T DO THAT. When I went to fold in the chocolate it hardened too quickly because of the chilled bowl etc. It made little chocolate bits through instead of a consistent chocolate flavored mousse. I'm sure the recipe would have turned out great had I not done that. I suspect my family will love this special Valentine's Day dessert anyway!",

For those who live in Western Canada I used Purdy's milk chocolate in this. I'm just trying to keep my spoon out of before my guests arrive for Easter dinner tonight! I put it in Martini glasses and topped it with a little whip cream i reserved. I also thought it would be nice next time to fold in chocolate shavings.",
