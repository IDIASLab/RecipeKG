I made this as directed but my \"baking sheet\" was rimless - which translates to hot honey all over the bottom of my oven! Next I did not have (or know what it was) pomegranate molasses but I did have regular molasses...can you see where this is going? Well the molasses taste was over powering but I was determined to eat these potent pears anyway. Everything else about this recipe rocked! Just be sure to use a rimmed baking sheet and please do get pomegranate molasses - it is not the same as sorghum molasses. I will make these again (correctly) because even with the problems and substitutions I knew it was a good recipe.",
