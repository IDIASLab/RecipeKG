I add more ranch as it sits until it is the consistency I like.  Also, I started using Bacon Ranch to up the ranch flavor.  Also, I use green onions instead of regular onions, and add about 2 cups of peas.",

I don't usually keep shell pasta on hand--elbow macaroni is usually the pasta I'll use. I like to use either red or green onions in this salad recipe. If you can make this earlier in the day so it has time to set and really let the flavors work together. EDITED: I make this \"lighter\" now making the dressing from a mixture of nonfat greek yogurt lowfat mayonnaise and reduced fat sour cream for the dressing turkey bacon and whole wheat pasta. My family actually prefers the lower fat version!",
