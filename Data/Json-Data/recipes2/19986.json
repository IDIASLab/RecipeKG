My recommendation would be to make sure you drain all the canned fruit really well as it does have a tendency to get a little watery after it sits. I had to drain the excess liquid a couple of times after the salad was made. Leftovers the next day were still very good and the walnuts and apples were still crunchy. I did not bother to halve the cherries. Thanks for the easy tasty recipe Espinoza!",
