This drink is absolutely incredible and extremely well-known and loved in this region of France. It is a very strong drink and locals enjoy warning you about not drinking too much. Also be careful about putting too much Creme de Cassis in it or it will be too strong. In the beginning when I could not handle alcohol very well a friend substituted the wine for water. It tasted great though not quite as good as white wine. But was significantly less strong.",

Wines vary in sweetness or lack of depending on brand and type and the nice thing about adding Cr\u00e8me de cassis is you can do so to taste. Start with a little and adjust accordingly. Cr\u00e8me de cassis is a sweet dark red syrupy liqueur made from blackcurrants. It's delicious and really does add a touch of \"special sweetness\" to white wine. As with most things look for a quality brand Dijon France is known for its cassis production... think of it like using imitation vanilla extract or 100% pure Madagascar vanilla extract.",
