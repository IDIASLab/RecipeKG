Ofcourse whenever you are in hurry you can never find the one thing you are in need of in this case pineapple juice so I bought the jug of orange pineapple and apple juice mix. It turned out great! Everybody said it reminded them of the pina colada drink mom use to make. They all thought it looked like a high calorie drink and were happy to find out that it was made using coconut extract instead of coconut milk which is much higher in calories. I will be making this again. Thanks for posting it!",
