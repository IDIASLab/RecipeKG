I really liked the addition of the crushed chips in this one. It added texture. I did use jalapeno instead of the green bell and then I had some sliced olives that needed used and I added them too. The one thing I did like better about the other salad was the dressing. It too had a ranch dressing base but it also called for taco seasoning and that was a nice touch. Regardless this was a great salad and one I will make again. Thanks for sharing!",
