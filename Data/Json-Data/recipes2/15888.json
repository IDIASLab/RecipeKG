I read all the reviews and decided to try 2 versions. 1 with just goat cheese the other with a combo goat/ricotta. Stick with just goat! The best. Also I REALLY struggled with cooking the bacon all the way through without demolishing the figs in the cooking process. So I tried pre-cooking the bacon in the micro first but when wrapped around the figs and broiled the bacon ended up burning. The best solution was to just make a little pile of proscuitto on top of the figs!! No wrapping no toothpicks lower fat and not greasy but very similar taste! I can't wait until next year's fig crop is ripe... and neither can my neighbor! He loved 'em as much as we did!!",
