Instead of adding the ham and peas and milk to the pasta I heated the milk in a seperate pan then melted the cheese in. Then I stirred in my peas ham and pasta. The sauce was a bit bland for my tastes so I'll try jazzing it up a bit. Also the pasta was somewhat dry even with using a 12 oz package instead of a 16. Needs a bit more sauce.",
