I added a little more sour cream and cheese to the recipe.  What also worked well for me is the following:  In a large bowl, add the sour cream, cheese, some worcestershire sauce, some ground mustard, pepper, and powdered onion.  Mix it together and then add the cooked cauliflower...fold gently until it's well coated and place in the greased pan.  Then place some sliced tomatoes over the top.  Sprinkle buttered breadcrumbs over that and dust lightly with paprika...then bake.  It's like a good mac and cheese, but healthier!  I really liked the taste and texture!",

But I must say I much prefer cauliflower this way now!!! Thanks so much for this delicious recipe. Very easy to make too. I used light sour cream and I didn't think the taste was compromised. This tasted even BETTER the next day as the sauce thickened up. I think this would be nice also if you wanted to add a couple of more veggies to it. All in all this is definitely a keeper!
