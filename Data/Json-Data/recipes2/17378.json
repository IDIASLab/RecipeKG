I took out all of the fat from the sauce. The next day I cooked up some angel hair pasta poured the sauce over it and let it sit in the frige. I also deboned the chicken. For supper I put a little olive oil in a pan and tossed the pasta and chicken until it was heated through. It was wonderful especially with a little garlic pepper and a little extra soy sauce. (I used low sodium soy sauce.) This is a keeper!!",
