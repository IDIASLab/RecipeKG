One of the other things about Santa Maria-style tri-tip is that it is cooked over red oak wood.  The oak and the simple seasonings are what brings out the excellent flavor of the meat.",

Next, coat meat with olive oil and rub with dry ingredients, minus black pepper. Also, I like chipotle way better than cayenne. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight (yes, that makes two days).  Preheat smoker to 165-180 degrees and place cold meat straight from the fridge over active smoke (for this I like roughly 50% oak, 40% cherry and 10% mesquite). Smoke until internal temp reaches 100-105 degrees, then place the meat on the grill over a bed of hot coals. Baste with vinegar sauce. Sear but try not to burn the meat too much. Grill to 130 degrees internal then remove from the grill and hit all sides with a little freshly ground black pepper, tent with foil and let stand for about 5 minutes or so. Slice 1/4 inch thick cross grain. Magnificent!",

The meat was a little hotter on the inside than stated but it may have been because it sat out longer than 4 hours. I will take that into consideration next time. The left overs are tender and can be used a variety of ways. The next day I sliced thin against the grain and made steak salads topped with homemade shoestring french fries...yum.

My only change in Chef John's recipe was crushed fresh garlic, rather than powdered, and chopped fresh rosemary, rather than dried.  Being concerned about blacked beef being carcinogenic, however, I followed Chef John's grilling directions only until the tri-tip was totally browned and sealed.  Then the heat was lowered, allowing the meat to cook more slowly until it reached Chef John's recommended inside temp of 130 degrees.  With an electric knife, I sliced the roast on the diagonal & arranged with wedges of B Follick's marinated Grilled Portobello Mushrooms.  Yum!",

I BBQ'd 2 tri-tips this weekend, 1 traditional and 1 using this recipe. Both were delicious, but heavily critiqued, as is the Santa Maria way when it comes to such serious business as tri-tip! Many people said this 1 tasted as if i had used seasoned salt instead of garlic salt, others disliked the mustard/ vinegar flavor. I personally think this recipe tastes more like San Luis Obispo (SLO) style which is usually served w/ bbq sauce than Santa Maria style which is usually served with homemade salsa.",
