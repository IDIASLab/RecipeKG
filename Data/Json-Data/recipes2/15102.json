We eat a loaf produced by Warburtons which contains lots of poppy sunflower & sesame seeds & also millet which made my personal version of this stuffing very tasty indeed. I also substituted a quarter of the butter with virgin olive oil which gave a Meditteranean twist. This was the first time I've ever made my own stuffing & was a simple easy recipe to start with. It went very well with the roast chicken we ate but my other half says he prefers the shop-bought stuff:( No pleasing some people!",

Several people were raving about it and several people thought it was just \"okay\"...I thought it was aweful not because of the taste but because the amount of fat used in it was unnecessary. I would use MAYBE 1/2 c. butter or margarine next time. Also I spread the stuffing into a baking dish and baked at 350 until it was firmed up and lightly browned. I will probably not make this again.",
