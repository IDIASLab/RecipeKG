I did add a tablespoon of water becuase I was wary of it being dry. I didn't add any ginger either! And I used Pam instead of oil to cook the patties in a skillet.  I served it with brown rice and a vege. IT turned out great!  My fiance loved it, and he ain't a fan of ground turkey (becuase the texture is so much different from that of ground beef, but he said the flavor trumped the texture!). My coworkers liked it too, and asked for the recipe.  This will be used often in my household!",

Despite the fact that I doubled the garlic added a small amount of salt pepper and sesame oil they were still a bit bland. The next time I make this I am going to add more of all the flavor ingredients I used this time (garlic ginger soy sauce sesame oil pepper and salt). By the way for those of you that find the meat dry you might want to try a trick suggested by Cook's Illustrated: add 1/2 cup of ricotta cheese for each 1.25 lbs of 93% lean ground turkey. They say it makes the burgers moist and chewy.",

The 20 month old wouldn't touch it but she's in a picky phase lately. I didn't have any fresh ginger on hand so I just used a little dry ground ginger instead. Tasted fine. Will make this again!
