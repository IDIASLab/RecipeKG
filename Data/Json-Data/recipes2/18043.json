Make sure the onions you use aren't too large, otherwise the onion can overpower everything else.  Don't skimp on the cilantro, it really adds flavor.  I think less onion, and more cucumbers and radishes is a good idea.  Also -- don't wimp out and use squeeze lemon juice.  The real thing is so much better.  Also, if you are going to make this a lot, invest $20 in one of those Vidalia Onion Chopper thingies.  It cuts your prep time in half -- at least.  Plus, the thing is just fun to use.  Point it away from you when chopping tomatoes though, otherwise you will look like an axe murderer.",

For 8 servings I used 2 lbs. of cleaned and peeled medium size shrimp which I cut into 4 pieces. Due to more shrimp, I didn't have enough lemon juice to cover them so I added a half squirt bottle of lime juice. I used tomato/shrimp cocktail juice (instead of the tomato and clam juice) I omitted the radishes and used one large white onion and one large jalapeno. Since my hubby needs his spicy;but not super hot, I added a bit of sea salt and 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper and a tsp. of garlic granules. My neighbor always makes ceviche but hers is very basic and her shrimp are always kind of raw so I would pick them out and microwave them for a minute. The lemon/lime juice does a great job of cooking the shrimp pieces but I left them soaking in it for 3 hours before adding other ingredients. YUMMY!!!! Thanks!!!",

I thickened it up a bit by giving it a squeeze of tomato paste & I added a tbp. or so of tequila. You couldn't really taste the tequila... it just tasted a bit richer & more complex. I served this in martini glasses rimmed w/ kosher salt (mostly for visual appeal) & lined w/ tortilla chips. Loved it...thanks!",

But the next times, I ommited the radishes & added 2 limes & 1 avacado. We love avacado! lol.  I also didn't use jumbo shrimp to make it more tortilla friendly.  The way we eat ceviche is, I toast whole tortillas in some oil & then, after they've cooled, spread some mayo in the tortilla, top it with ceviche & munch away. It's great!  :)",
