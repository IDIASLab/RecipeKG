Also I added water chestnuts and omitted bean sprouts- which was a good call for our family. Lastly I would add more garlic to the sauce lessen the amount of celery and green onions- since those two veggies somewhat overpour the dish. But other than that it's a very tasty rice dish. Will definitely try again with a few changes.",

I then cooked another cup of rice..let cool and then added it. This gave it a neat effect b/c the soy sauce mix had already \"darkened\" the rice I had mixed in and the addition of the new white rice gave it a neat look. Now with the 2c cooked rice it was much less salty and I was able to enjoy it better. However not my favorite salad recipe but still a nice idea and change from the norm. Thanks Teri.",
