We do things a little differently:  cut chicken into bite-size pieces, soak in beaten eggs for 2 hours, then dip out and put into large plastic bag already filled with Italian seasoned bread crumbs, minced garlic, and parsley. Shake until coated then put into hot pan with oil and brown all over. Place browned chicken pieces into casserole, top with 8 oz-1 lb. fresh, sliced mushrooms, 12 oz. shredded muenster cheese, then pour 1 cup chicken broth over.  Bake at 350 for 30 minutes or until golden and bubbly. Serve over rice. YUM-YUM-YUM!!!",
