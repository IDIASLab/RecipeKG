Also I added a little achiote to the blended ingredients just for fun. I substituted 8 chicken thighs with skin instead of chicken breast because I prefer chicken on the bone. Just tastes better in my opinion. Once it cooked in salsa for an hour I pulled the chicken thighs out of the salsa and put them on a baking sheet to broil for a few minutes to give it a little more of a grilled flavor. Then I threw them back in the salsa to serve with Mexican rice. Excellent recipe and I will make it again!",
