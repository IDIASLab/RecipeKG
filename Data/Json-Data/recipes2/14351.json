I used a wheat crust put minced garlic on the cream cheese before adding the cheese used a bag and a quarter of cheese (about 2 1/2 cups) and then putting green onions and chopped turkey bacon on the top. I used an 8 oz package of cream cheese to make it easy to spread and that was WAY too much. The pizza was really good but it was too rich with all of the cream cheese I put. Next time will make it with about half closer to the recipe amount. Did really like the overall taste though and will make again.",
