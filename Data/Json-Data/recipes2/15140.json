I was pleasantly surprised this turned out fantastic! Based on the other reviews I did use the equivalent of 4 eggs (actually 1 cup of Better N Eggs to lower the fat content) and 3/4 cup reduced fat Swiss cheese. I also cooked 5 strips of Morningstar 'fakin' bacon' and crumbled that up and sprinkled it on top of the onions which I layered in a whole wheat frozen pie crust (pre-baked for 10 minutes at 450 since I like a crisp crust). Then I poured the egg and cheese mixture over the onions and 'bacon' and baked the whole thing until the top was slightly browned. It turned out delicious such a versatile recipe. You could add almost any kind of meat or even use fake meat as I did. I do think it wouldn't be nearly as good with just the onions and cheese but would be more like an omelette in a crust. The savoriness of the 'bacon' really made this special. And it's so easy I always thought quiche was difficult but I whipped this up in just a few minutes! Definitely a keeper.",

This recipe lends itself to that.   Instead of heavy cream, I used some canned evaporated milk, and added a fourth egg as others have suggested. To season, I mixed in a tablespoon of onion soup mix and some black pepper in with the eggs. I used a blend of cheddar and monterey jack cheese since I didn't have any swiss.
