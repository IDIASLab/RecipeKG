I used frozen white shoepeg corn, only because I personally hate canned corn (if you use canned I'd drain that too), and I used one can black beans and one can kidneys - just to add to the color.  Also, instead of bottled Italian dressing I made my own with capers, caper juice, white wine, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, and garlic - you can probably use any kind of oil/vinegar dressing you like.  The jalepeno added just enough spice, I'd personally use a little more but this was fine.  Oh - and I used whole grape tomatoes, sliced ones may make it too runny also.",

I did make a few changes.  I added some cumin, cayenne pepper and chili powder.  After I had it all mixed up I thought it was screaming for pasta so I added about a cup of cooked rotini.  I used red and green peppers and also added a bit of chopped celery.  I left the pimentos out because it was red enough and didn't have the avocado so I skipped that as well. My end result was a very tasty and pretty side dish.",

Don't skimp on the cilantro and for some additional punch add a little more jalapeno pepper. Delicioso!",
