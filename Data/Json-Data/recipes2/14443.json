I've never had mou shu pork before so I can't really say if this particular recipe makes a good mou shu pork. Personally none of us liked it. I don't know if it was the soy that's already in the Hoison sauce and then more soy added to the recipe that did it but it left a bitter aftertaste. Perhaps if the 2 T. of soy called for was left out it might be passable. I used low salt soy too.",

I would definitely cut back on the ginger next time and I used cabbage instead of bok choy. I would also suggest using rice pancakes from an Asian grocery instead of flour tortillas. We tried wrapping ours in lettuce leaves that was good. I can't quite put my finger on what was wrong with the taste but I know that in Chinese restaurants they put either hoisin or plum sauce right on the rice pancake before serving the pork. This way made the dish a little too saucy.",

Next time I will cut the ginger in half as he said that the ginger was too overwhelming. I would also cut the pork into thin strips to have it cook faster and I would do the meat in two batches as it cooked but didn't brown. Not a bad dish but I think it might need some tweaking. I am just not sure how to accomplish that. Hopefully someone else here will have great ideas to offer.:)",

It worked out great and saved tons of time I would have spent chopping. Omitted the sake as I was feeding this to the kids and used dried ginger powder instead of fresh. I definitely recommend using egg-roll wrappers instead of tortillas - they have the right \"asian\" texture and taste. Steam them for a few minutes before serving or microwave a few at a time wrapped in a moist paper towel for 30-seconds.",
