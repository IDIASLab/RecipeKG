We microwaved the butter and marshmallows however with 2 batches so we could use food coloring to give the eggs color. We used 1 1/2 tbsp of butter and half a bag ( about 20 lg marshmallow) for 2 1/2 minutes and stirred til creamy adding the food coloring in as we stirred then added 3 cups of Rice Krispies. We sprayed plastic eggs with cooking spray so that the mix wouldn't stick when molding and filled each half of the egg then closed it to press it together. For the chocolate we bought Baker's Dipping Chocolate that could be easily melted in the microwave and then dipped in sprinkles. They came out great and will be a new family tradition! Thanks so much for the idea!",
