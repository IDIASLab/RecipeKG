I found this most interesting recipe - and it is delicious!! I did not have pine nuts, so for my serving, I tossed in some dry roasted edamame (that was a snack in my pantry that I did not like eating by itself - and it added some crunch, and did not kill the dish LOL). Next time tho, I will get the pine nuts.  Nice tantalizing combo of flavors, am definitely adding it to my 'pass down' recipe list!!",
