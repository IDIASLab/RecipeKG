I like to simplify the process by chopping the chocolate in my food processor until, then pour the hot cream down the feed tube and give it a whirl... in seconds you have wonderful ganache. Use this ganache warm as a pourable glaze, let it cool to room temp (over night) and use like a standard frosting, or chill until firm and whip with a heavy stand mixer until it's light in color and spreadable. You can even use this ganache to make authentic chocolate truffles - just roll the chilled ganache (unwhipped) into balls and coat with cocoa powder, chopped nuts, or whatever.",

I then melted a little green chocolate (available at Michael's stores) and drizzled it over the top. Absolutely Heavenly. Store in the refrigerator incredibly rich and creamy with a nice mint flavor.
