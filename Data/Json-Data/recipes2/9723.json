For the next pie, I reduced the sweetened condensed milk by nearly half and substituted about 3 oz. of fat-free unsweetened condensed milk and about 4 oz. of additional whipped topping.  The result was a much better pie.  I recommend using the extra creamy topping and freezing the pie as well.  For both the strawberry and lemon versions, top with sliced strawberries which freeze well and draw sweetness from the filling.  This pie is a real surprise. The fruit flavors seem far more authentic thus than in the Kool-aid itself (which I don't much like).",
