I altered the recipe slightly; I added a whipped cream and a couple of swipes of nutmeg across my grater. The effect was multidimensional. The mug was warm in my hands the heady aroma of nutmeg assailed my nose the cloud of whipped cream was silky on my lips and then the velvety taste of the coffee and Baileys slid across my pallet. An immediate AHHHH reponse came over me and all was right with the world once again. Love this!",
