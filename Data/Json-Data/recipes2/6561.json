I made it all in one pot made the noodles first and put in a strainer and then made the rest in the same pot added the noodles back in. Topped with cheese sour cream and creamy avocados. Filled our bellies and it is actually pretty healthy to boot.",

We just moved and I lost my printed copy so I came here only to be flabbergasted\u00a0that there's only three reviews. Here's mine: This recipe is awesome, the flavors meld together really well. I've made this as is with rave reviews, and sometimes I add ground turkey when my husband wants something meatier. The seasonings are strong enough that you can't tell it's turkey and not beef. I love how quick this is to prep, and provides enough leftovers to last quite a few meals. You know how sometimes you get tired of a meal and can't finish off the leftovers? Not the case here. In fact this might be my favorite leftover meal. This is a staple to our fall/winter meal rotation.",
