This was my first time making egg rolls (even after 30-plus years of cooking, the concept always seemed too intimidating to try), and they turned out to be the most fantastic egg rolls my husband and I have ever had.  I did eliminate the bean sprouts...only because I did not have any in the house...and I steamed and chopped fresh shrimp instead of using canned. I also subbed dried red-pepper flakes for the black pepper, and these came out tasting better than my now \"OLD-favorite\" egg rolls at my favorite Thai restaurant.  These proved so much easier to make than I ever could have imagined.  I found that I did not need the cornstarch mixture to seal the wrappers; I used the moisture from the bottom of the bowl that the filling had been sitting in.  I had absolutely no issues with the wraps coming apart, and didn't need to use any toothpicks.  This is a fantastic recipe!!  I would urge anyone who loves egg rolls to try this recipe; you will be shocked at how easy they are to make.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe Rouver, I will be using it often!",
