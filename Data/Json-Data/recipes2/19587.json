Definitely purchase some sole when it's in season (as I did). I had to adjust the amount of ingredients used because sole can be an extremely thin fish, so I purchased more than the 2 fillets which the recipe calls for.   I used a white wine that I knew was delicious and actually left out the thyme because I didn't want to spend money on two herbs.  GREAT recipe.",

I served it with butternut squash torellini.  It was fabulous.  My 2 year old even liked it!",
