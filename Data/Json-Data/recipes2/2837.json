Honestly, without it, it would be pretty bland--and I used serranos instead of jalopenos (lately, the ones I buy have NO HEAT!)  Also, I did not have any pepperjack cheese, so I used mix of swiss & parm.  AND, I added in some frozen corn.  I made one big mistake:  I did not have any jarred Alfredo, so made some fresh and used that--it separated upon reheating.  Still tasted pretty good, but . . . .   I  think it is still pretty bland, but sometimes that is perfect.  It is mostly pasta and cheese--lots of cheese.  If I make it again, I will increase the chiles, and add in more sausage and burger!  But it was still pretty darned good.",

Next time I will use cubed chicken pieces instead of shredding it.  Also, cooking the jalape\u00f1os and onions with the bacon prevented the bacon from getting crisp...I will cook the bacon separately and drain on paper towels; then use the same pan with the drippings to saut\u00e9 the onions and peppers.   And I will just mix everything together and then sprinkle with mozzarella and the cracker crumb topping because the center \u201ccheese layer\u201d was unnoticeable!   Otherwise I loved it and so did my guests!",
