To make it easier I just popped my whole wheat bread in the toaster first then used Sabra Classic Hummus and thinly sliced Honeycrisp apples (all I had on hand) with sliced sharp Cheddar and stuck it in my toaster oven. It was definitely different and in a good way! I will totally make this again. Thanks for the recipe!",

Once I threw a small handful of spinach between the apples and cheese to add some vegetable that was great too. Slice the apples as thin as you can they way they get \"cooked\" a bit more during broiling which really brings out the tangy sweetness.",
