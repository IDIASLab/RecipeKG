It's so yummy and is so nutritious because the nutrition isn't cooked out of the beets. Everyone that has tried it, likes it. It's better if let set for a few hours but doesn't have to be. Serve for a cold lunch with boiled eggs on a bed of lettuce.",

Yes you do end up very red from grating beets but it is worth the extra washing up. Skin counters dishes and sink all cleaned very easily. I didn't get any on my clothes so no promises there! I used a homemade Dijon Mustard with Szechuan peppercorns which seems to have worked well in this recipe. There is a tiny bit of heat from both the mustard and the garlic but not overwhelming. I didn't realize how wonderful raw beets tasted. I will be making this one over and over again.",

Get some every 2 weeks from a farm share program and wanted to make something in addition to pickled and roasted beets. This was great! Made it exactly as written. Don't forget the black pepper as it seems to set off the other flavors. Just made it and without letting it sit in the fridge it is already very very good. Think I'll top a lettuce leaf salad with them this evening. Great recipe thanks!!",
