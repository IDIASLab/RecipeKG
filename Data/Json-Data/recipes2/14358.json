What I found was a very tasty and easy to make success. I was a bit leery about the \"too salty\" comments but I believe that I resolved that when I added an outer layer of whipped cream cheese to cover up the flecking from the ranch dressing. The extra cream cheese seemed to take away some of the saltiness. This cheeseball was a big hit with my family and much easier to make than my usual one. Thank you so very much for posting this wonderful addition to AR.",
