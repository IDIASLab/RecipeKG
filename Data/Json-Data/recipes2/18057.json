I was struggling to choose a recipe, so I decided to try three different pesto recipes from this site.  In A-typical allrecipes fashion I actually stuck exactly to each recipe so that we could truly judge them fairly.  The recipes were Easy Pesto by Rebecca Jane Thompson, Pesto Sauce by Sara, and Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto by FuzzyGreenMonkey.  My favorite was Easy Pesto.  It had a nice nutty flavor because of the toasted almonds.  It's also nice if you don't have much basil on hand because it uses half as much as the other recipes.  My husband liked Simple Garlic and Basil Pesto the best, it was my close second.  The parmesan cheese and pine nuts really make that recipe.  We both agreed that by far our least favorite was Pesto Sauce.  It was very bland compared to the other two.  I would attribute that to the 1 1/2 cups of walnuts.  I would not recommend that recipe at all.  It was a fun experiment and the other two recipes will go into my permanant file.",

Especially, after his mom gave us about a dozen heads of Italian Red garlic (home grown).  About 12 cups of this pesto by the end. We love it so much!  We didn't have the brasil nuts when we made it during summer (added more pine nuts), but we will this summer.  We added just a pinch of crushed red with the chili powder, and maybe a tiny bit less oil.  SO YUMMY!  I look forward to the sale this coming summer, as our frozen stock of pesto is running out!!  Yes, this does freeze well, but be sure to freeze in small containers or plastic bags, not a giant 2 qt thing I did the first time, then had to thaw and refreeze.  Also, we might a bit of lemon juice next time to help preserve the color, but that's because we are big \"make and freeze\" fans around thse parts.  =)",
