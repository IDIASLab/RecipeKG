I topped it off with a little more sauce and cheese before baking. Plus, I made an easy marinara in my crockpot during the day. Used that instead of the jar kind.  This dish had so much more flavor than your typical stuffed shells, plus it\u2019s healthier. My daughters, who are vegetarians, went back for seconds. I will definitely be making it again.",
