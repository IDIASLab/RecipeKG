Also I used a little more chicken broth than indicated in the recipe because if you use it in a can you have 2 oz left over after you put in the 1 1/2 cups in the recipe. I couldn't bring myself to throw it out but what are you gonna do with 2 ounces of leftover chicken broth?? Oh the broth I had in the house was low-sodium so that's what I used and it was fine. This recipe seemed to have a perfect balance of the different flavors. I definitely wouldn't mess with the amounts of apples raisins and especially the garlic or the balance might be lost. We'll be making this one often!",

The next time I used only enough butter necessary to cover the bottom of the pan and it was a lot better. I would reduce the amount of raisins to somewhere around 1/3 cups. They overpower the dish in terms of aesthetics and in terms of taste when 1/2 cup is used. Next time I might grate the apple. Overall a good recipe.",

Covered with plastic wrap and vented. Nuked on high for 5 mins then medium for 15 mins and let rest for 5 more minutes and fluffed with a fork. It was perfect.
