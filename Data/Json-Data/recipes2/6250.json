It is not the same as the mozzarella balls only because I used a block instead of a log of the fresh stuff. I think it would be better using the fresh mozzarella. I was trying to save money as the marinated fresh mozzarella in the deli section is expensive. But it is a great recipe using mostly pantry items and I will make again.",
