In the same pan I sauteed cubed potatoes carrots celery onions and 2 minced cloves of garlic when vegetables are almost tender I added in 1 can butter beans and the 2 cans of soups plus 2 cups of water or you can use low sodium chicken broth. Simmered it all together until everything is tender and topped with refrigerated biscuits and simmered for another 7-8 minutes. I put the whole thing in the oven to broil until gloden brown and a little crispy on top of the biscuits. It was sensational!",
