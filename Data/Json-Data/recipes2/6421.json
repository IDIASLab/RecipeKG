To ease preparation you can season and then freeze.  Defrost as you would normally and they are ready to cook. This seasoning also works well by seasoning meat prior to freezing.  The longer it sits on the chops the better.",

About half way through the cooking time I added 1/2 a lemon's worth of juice and some worcestershire sauce. I also added small amounts of water as the pan got dry.
