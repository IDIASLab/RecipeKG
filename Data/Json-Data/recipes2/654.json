They will probably be the cheapest lamb at the store, have more flavor and richness than leg meat, and are cheaper than shanks and loins. It takes a while for the meat to braise and fall off the bone, but it's a wait rewarded with tender, succulent chucks of lamb.",

I do, however, buy leg, breast, racks (OMG yummm) and ground.  It is probably my favorite meat ever.  I also love Irish stew. This recipe is perfection!   \nAs you will probably notice, I had to substitute frozen vegetables for soup in this dish today as I didn't have any carrots.  I actually found the variety of vegetables delicious.  I do, however, feel like the way Chef John wrote it is the way to go.  I just didn't feel like going to the grocery store just for carrots!  So I improvised with what I did have on hand :-)  I also made the colcannon from AR and OMG, you couldn't ask for a better meal!\nGive this recipe a try.  I know you are going to enjoy it as much as I am (I'm eating it as I'm writing this! )Thanks Chef John :-)",

But I love it wend someone do the recipe with alterations, I too can't leave anything alone! I have to play with my food. You did adjusted it to your personal taste that what I like, to see what others have did to any improvements and/or variations you make to this simple recipe. I use 3 pounds lamb shoulder chops a little extra garlic but otherwise made as-is. I did read one review that gave this recipe a lower rating because it contained alcohol, You can substitute 1-1/2 cups chicken stock. YES I DO SEE this is on the radar too. Going to be tough to top this one though. I did adjusted to my personal taste. Your way is very delicious. The next time I did it and I add it to my recipe box and to My Note: My family loved bouth ways, and I'll be making this a lot more. Both are delicious, it's a matter of what your taste is....I now have two ways to this. YOU HAVE SUCCESS!! with me. Now I can do my happy food dance!!  Thank you!!! Happy Cooking to you and y'all!

I'm making it for a date tonight it's THAT GOOD and impossible to mess up. Another great thing about this recipe is that you can make it early leave simmering for awhile if you're not sure what time you're going to eat. Perfect the way it is but here's another version: follow recipe exactly only without the potatoes at first. Then follow Chef John's mashed potatoes recipe once both are finished ladle the stew over the mashed potatoes and sprinkle with a few extra green onions for garnish. Freezer Tips: I make it all the way put the stew and the mashed potatoes in separate ziplok bags freeze then take to a cabin in the mountains to enjoy with a glass of red wine in front of the fire. Perfect because all you have to do is reheat and enjoy! Highly suggest visiting his website as well-entertaining and informative; inspired my love for cooking.",

Unfortunately I added too much water, so it was a bit like a chunky soup, but still incredibly flavourful and the lamb was amazing! My husband said \"this is good,\" three times!\nThanks, Chef John!
