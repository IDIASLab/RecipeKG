I added about 1 cup more chicken broth and I pre-salted the chicken pieces. The chicken was properly seasoned but the rest of the rice was too salty. Also the rice remained crunchy even though I cooked the dish for about 2 hours. It took that long for the chicken to cook all the way through. I'll keep the recipe but next time I might partially cook the rice before adding it to the rest of the mixture.",
