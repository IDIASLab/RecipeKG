My suggestions: add the egg just after you flip the bread to toast the second side - also lower the heat and increase the cooking time so your egg cooks more thoroughly and your toast doesn't burn. You can use fun cookie cutter shapes ... hearts for Valentine's Day, stars for the Fourth of July ... and don't discard the cutouts. Instead toast them in the pan and top with your favorite preserves. Photo available on my profile page.",

I just finished eating this and man this was a good breakfast. I used whole wheat bread and I cut out a heart instead of a circle.Next time I makes this I need a bigger boat since the hole I cut was a little to small for my egg. I recomend turning down the heat right before you put you egg in so you don't burn your toast while the egg cooks. Next time I try this I am going to scramble my eggs in a bowl first since I don't like runny yolks as much as scrambled eggs.",

Then I add pepper, salt, basil and the smallest pinch of rosemary to the egg before I flip it. Yum!",
