I too substitute thick cut bacon lardons for the salt pork. It just gives it a nice smokier flavor. Additionally I will usually include thin sliced onion. Depending on my mood I'll also use split peas. Put them right in dry. It just give a little different texture to it and slightly different taste. It's all good though.",
