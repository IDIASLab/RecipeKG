I also stay away from red pepper unless I chop them well in advance and they have been drained. Otherwise the water from the peppers makes the dip runny... People at parties and picnics can't get enough of this dip and I have handed out the recipe 100 times. I prefer sharp cheddar cheese to mild as it gives the dip an extra kick. That is a matter of personal preference though...",
