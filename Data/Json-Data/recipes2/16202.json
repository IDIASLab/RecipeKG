Adding salt to taste was a wonderful suggestion. Minced garlic to your liking. And for preserving the whiteness of the end result you'll want to use good quality butter for the beurre manie. Because the flavor of the lobster is in the butter to which you are adding the broth cream and pepper you don't want to pour that out! You'll want to keep the butter... just make sure to clean your mushrooms and to not overcook them which causes the butter to become discolored.",
