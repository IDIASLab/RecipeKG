It's usually made in large quantities so there will be leftovers to toss with either pasta or rice the next day. It can be made either in the oven or on the stovetop. This is the stovetop version. This is even better the next day!",

I did add more garlic because I just love it, but other than that was true to the original recipe.  We had it with a pesto salmon last night and today warmed it up and topped an egg for a healthy, light  lunch.  Will do again and thank you for sharing!",
