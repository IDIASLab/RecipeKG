I browned this in oil in an oven safe pan.  I removed the chicken and set it aside.  I added the chicken broth and tomatoes and brought this to a boil.  then I added in the chicken and 2 cloves of garlic, chopped.  after 2 or three minutes in the stove I added 1 cup of lima beans and put this into the oven.  I followed the rest of the recipe as usual.  my husband said it was good, but needed some depth of flavor so he added a little bottled raspberry chipole sauce.  it must have been good as he went back for seconds.",
