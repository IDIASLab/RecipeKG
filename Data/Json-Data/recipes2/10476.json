As it chills it really does develop a flavor all its own you can definitely taste the banana but really it develops its own chocolaty flavor.. I did have to add a little milk to get it to blend in my tiny blender but the consistency was still perfect.. and the best part is it is there is no added sugar or anything.. all natural ingredients... thanks for the idea",

But I was overly curious about the other recipes using avocado and bananas. After reading plenty of reviews I considered combining peoples' different suggestions on improving it. So I kept everything the same but left out one banana and added 2 tablespoons of peanut butter 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk about 1 tbs of honey and a few drops of vanilla Stevia. I also chopped up dairy free chocolate chips to garnish the top of the pudding instead of cocoa powder. Absolutely delicious with or without whipped cream. I highly recommend and the taste only gets better the longer it's in the fridge.",

One avocado here gave me almost 4 cups once blended, and our bananas our smaller, so I lost count of how many I put in after discarding bruises and dividing pieces amongst the kids.   I poured in cocoa powder to taste, and sweetened condensed milk for extra sweetness.  We aren't vegans.   Turned out great for our family with these changes",
