I cooked the potatoes in the broth with the soy sauce & ginger. I also added a little white pepper about 1/4 tsp. Once the potatoes were done I used an immersion blender to blend the potatoes into the broth which thickened it. Then added the green onion. I couldn't bring myself to add the tomato that just didn't sound good to me. Overall this was good but a little 'gritty'. I would consider adding a little corn frozen peas or even very finely diced carrot.",
