This recipe is perfect as is, but I love to play with stuff so I used half regular paprika and half smoked paprika, upped the cayenne a bit and added some ancho chili powder. Wow! This is a definite keeper and I found it to be even better than \"Taco Seasoning I\" from this site. This is perfect to store in a mini tupperware container along with my other spice mixes to have on hand. Great for tacos, seasoning chicken, throwing into chili or nachos, or anything else you can think of adding it into that might need a bit of spice!",
