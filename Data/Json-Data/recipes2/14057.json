As with most recipes I like to give this one my own flare. I use a 7.5 oz. package of macaroni and cheese (Kraft or generic it doesn't matter)instead of just macaroni. That gives the recipe an even more cheesy taste. Instead of the Cream of Chicken soup and the mushrooms I use Cream of Mushroom soup. I chop up the onions but also some celery and I saute them in a fry pan with about 3 T. butter. Then when they are tender I add the cooked and cut-up chicken and I fry it all together for a bit until the chicken has some nice brown to it. Due to the fact that I use the store-bought mac and cheese mix that has the powdered cheese packet I do add more milk than the recipe calls for (about 1-1/2 cups). At the end of baking I sprinkle a mixture of butter and saltine cracker crumbs onto the top and bake about another five to ten minutes until crisp. Whoever \"Walter\" is thanks for this yummy recipe! We need to submit a better photo of it for this site--the current one is not a very appetizing presentation.:-)",

I boiled my chicken breasts in water with a large chopped vidalia onion lots of chopped celery a couple of bay leaves seasoning salt and some cracked pepper until the chicken fell off the bone. Then I cooked the macaroni in the broth until al dente drained but did not rinse the macaroni and stirred it up with what was left of the onion and celery that fell into the strainer with the macaroni. Adding this mixture to the chicken and other ingredients added just the right amount of moisture and made the whole dish extra savory. Next time I think that I'll try a little extra cheese and a cracker topping. My husband and son loved this as did I. This recipe will be made again and again in this house. Thank you so much for sharing it!",

I sweated mushrooms celery and onion added the soup a beer chicken and cheese to make the sauce and tossed it with some whole durum wheat gobetti pasta before baking.
