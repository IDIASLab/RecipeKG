The veggies took closer to 35-40 minutes to roast for me, perhaps because of the double recipe and the reduction in oil, but it was worth it to me to cut back on the fat a bit. We loved it and I will definitely be making this again! I think it may have to go on our Christmas menu this year. Yummy!",
