Next time, I would use more linguine or cut the sauce ingredients.  It was a bit too saucy.  I would also add more green vegetables like fresh green beans and broccoli.",

Before combining the cream and broth, I'm going to make a roux of butter and flour (2 tablespoons of each) by melting the butter, then adding the flour and stirring.  Then I will add the broth and cream and proceed as directed.  I will probably also add a couple more pieces of bacon.  Other than that, this recipe is YUMMY.",
