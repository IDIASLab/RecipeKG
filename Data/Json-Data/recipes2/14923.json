I left out the American cheese entirely... it's already such a cheesy dish that you won't even miss it. I sprinkled some bottled parm on the top which fine as a substitute for the fresh. I didn't use meat-flavored sauce but I threw in some soy crumbled beef substitute to make it a vegetarian dish without seeming like a vegetarian dish! Also the composition turned out better in the metal baking pan I used than in the ceramic casserole dish. Not sure why but it was less watery in the metal pan.",
