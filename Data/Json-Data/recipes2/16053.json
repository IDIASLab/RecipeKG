I subtituted cottage cheese for the ricotta and egg beaters for the egg whites. Because I did not have fresh herbs on hand, I used one tbsp. of dried parsley and one tsp. of sweet basil.  I used bottled spagetti sauce.  I will definitely make it again.",

I used considerably more garlic and basil from the garden.  I used only 2 cups of sauce and only 1 cup of ricotta as the recipe seems to call for far too much in my opinion.

This last time I used cottage cheese because its a little bit healthier and less expensive than ricotta.  We actually liked the cottage cheese better, you just need to drain out a little of the cottage cheese juice before mixing it up.  Also I used dried parsley and basil and it still tasted great.  Try this dish!!",

I regretted not baking them...it would have been quicker and healthier. I also used an italian cheese blend instead of just mozzarella and felt the need to add more spices to the cheese and breadcrumb mixtures. And 2 Chernobyl sized zucchinis were more than enough. I also used 3 full eggs instead of 2 egg whites to coat the zucchini slices for breading and 3 full eggs instead of 6 whites for the cheese mixture. It was a lot of work; it tasted good; but I am struggling to say it was worth the work. I will try this again but I will bake the zucchinis and maybe that will streamline the process enough for me.",

Like lasagna this serves up better if you give it 15 minutes to 'set' after coming out of the oven. In deference to husband I replaced some zucchini slices with a couple pork cutlets - crumbed & baked alongside the zucchini they turned out perfect. And adding meat meant it counted as a main dish:) Next time I'll reduce the parmesan in the crumbs and use dried basil & garlic powder. To the cheese mixture I'm adding minced garlic fresh basil s&p and the 1/2 cup of parmesan reserved from the crumbs. Yum!",

Really blotted the juice out of a cup of cottage cheese and boiled an 8 oz. can of no-salt added tomato sauce to reduce it. Used 2/3 of a cup of a combo of mozzarella and provolone cheeses (ran out of mozzarella). Layered it in a glass loaf pan and baked it 35 minutes at 400 degrees.
