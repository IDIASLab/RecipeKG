I swear you could put anything inside a warm tortilla and it's gonna taste good... You can add pretty much anything you want or have on hand because once you combine scrambled eggs veggies breakfast meat and cheese in a warm tortilla you're in breakfast heaven! All you need is a side of salsa sour cream a little tabaso or cholula and you're all set. Next time I think I'll opt for a lower fat version and use a combination of eggs and egg beaters boca breakfast sausage links and reduced fat cheddar. Definitely hearty so make sure you're hungry!",
