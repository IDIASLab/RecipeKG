I'm still trying to use up some packaged ranch dressing I made (stupid me - it's got milk in it and can't be kept around) but normally I don't have ranch around. So I may play with this and see what I can do with it without the ranch.",

Well the horseradish and garlic woke up and it's better. I added a tablespoon of dry ranch dressing and a tiny pinch of red pepper flakes. By dinner it wasn't bad. On the chicken tenders it was pretty good. I may try it again with just ranch dressing and no mayo. The mustard and pepper flakes really helped it. I'll also use fresh grated horseradish.",
