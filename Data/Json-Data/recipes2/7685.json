I marinated them all day and the flavors were perfect. I baked them because the heavens opened as I was getting ready to grill. 25 minutes at 400 F was perfect. I poured the excess marinades in small saucepans and boiled it and cooked until reduced then poured it over the cooked chops. Thanks Goya for great condiments.",
