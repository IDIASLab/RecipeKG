Used my 11 silicon cupcake cups & baked 49 mins when a knife inserted in center came out clean. Made it all in the same food processor I used to grind walnuts sugar & melted butter that I just wiped clean before mixing up the creamcheese batter. Quick easy clean up & sooo good. I had two for dessert hubby had three calling them amazing. Gluten free too! Will make these again and again especially for the holidays!",
