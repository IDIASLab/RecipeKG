I love strong coffee, so no problem. I found that none of the flavors competed for attention, but the peanut butter and chocolate and coffee could all be tasted quite well. I have discovered that these frappuccino type drinks are best when the coffee is made into ice cubes first. Takes a little planning, but it is SO worth it not to have the drink watered down by regular ice.",
