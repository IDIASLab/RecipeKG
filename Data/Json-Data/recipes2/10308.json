Second, I mixed the slices with olive oil in a bowl to coat them thoroughly with less oil. Third, used a silicone sheet instead of foil. Fourth, I added salt, cinnamon, and chipotle-garlic grillmates seasoning before cooking. Allowed the chips to get brown on the edges and they\u2019ll have crispiness, but not like a processed chip. (Buy those if that\u2019s what you want.) Lastly, I let the chips cool on a cooling rack like one uses for cookies. Very tasty!! Thanks for posting this recipe! It was a very nice launching point for a super snack that I will make again and again!!!",
