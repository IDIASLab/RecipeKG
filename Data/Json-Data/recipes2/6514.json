I only had 2 boneless skinless breasts (.88 lb) so I cut the recipe in half. I just barely had enough of the flour/spice mix to cover the meat I think if I had had a full pound of chicken I would have needed more. The sauce didn't look like enough but turned out to be the exact right amount. It was the perfect combination of spicy and sweet for us not too much of either. Even my two year old loved it! Thanks for the great recipe.",

Also after tossing the chicken in the sauce I threw it under the broiler for a bit and I think that made it way better. I will make this again but I will use my own fried chicken tender recipe. I wasn't big on the flavors used in this one. It wasn't bad I just like mine better. Also I will cut way down on the soy sauce next time and continue to broil the chicken for a few minutes after covered in sauce. All in all this tasted a lot more like teriyaki to me than buffalo flavor. Still good and worth making though.",
