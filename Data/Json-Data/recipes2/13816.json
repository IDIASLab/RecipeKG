My husband and I ate a bowlful of this wonderful dish every other day until it was gone so I had none to freeze but I will next time. 5 STARS? More like 10 or 20! I made only one change: I used ALL beef stock; didn't have any chicken stock on hand",

The finished product is not bad but I think chili should have more of a meaty flavor and a little more spice while at the same time less cumin. Again this is not bad it s just not a real chili flavor in my opinion.",
