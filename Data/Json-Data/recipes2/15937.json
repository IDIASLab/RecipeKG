I think the name implies a typical pizza-tasting recipe which this is not. I also think the recipe lacks directions regarding the presentation. I followed the recipe exactly (except for the vegetable ingredients). After the \"crust\" cooled I transfered it to a rectangular serving platter (you have to cut it a little to conform to the size of your platter). I topped it with the cream cheese mixture and then added 1/2 cup chopped fresh broccoli 1/2 cup shredded carrots and then two handfuls of fresh baby spinach. I then topped with the cheddar cheese. Before serving I sliced into squares. It was so colorful and gourmet-looking. Everybody loved it! If someone could post a photo I think it would help with the popularity of this overlooked recipe. Thanks Cindy!!!",

                "reviewBody": "I halved this recipe just for my two kids and I. I cut everything in half BUT the spices. I used reduced fat crescent roll dough/cream cheese/mayonnaise but I kept all the spices the same. After I added half of the halved vegetables called for I didn't feel as if it was enough veggies. I added some halved small cherry tomatoes and quartered zucchini. I've made something like this before--especially during the summer months. I have to say it's one of my most favorite meals. A half recipe makes enough for dinner for the three of us and a small lunch for me the next day. I think the longer this sits the better it gets. NOTE: Two cans laid on a cookie sheet will almost fill one sheet if you lay it out horizontally and the sheet is laying long ways up if that makes sense. Make sure you spritz your baking sheet a little with non stick cooking spray if your sheets have a tendancy to cling to the dough sometimes.",
