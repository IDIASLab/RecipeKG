I did use half Italian dressing and half light mayo because that's how I like my pasta salads that have Italian dressing in them. I also used whole wheat shell pasta because that is what I had. I do love how the whole wheat pasta tastes in this salad and I suggest using the shell-shaped pasta because it grabs onto the ingredients. I really love this salad and have a hard time controlling myself around it!!!!",

I used shell pasta cause I think it grabs the dressing better. EVERYONE loved it and went for seconds. a different take on macaroni pasta. DELICIOUS!",

So unique but not weird. I also used Italian dressing and mayo I left out the onion only used 1 egg 1 tomato and 1 celery stalk and it turned out fantastic.
