Rather than serving it OVER the pasta I just tossed everything altogether. Simply a beautiful as well as delicious side dish pasta.

If people change ingredients then create your own recipe and post. And for Naples comment there is nothing wrong with adding olive oil to your boiling noodles when the dish is oil based with olive oil or butter. Your misconception comes from pasta dishes where you don't want oil in the noodle water as it causes the sauce to repel from the noodle on the plate. Enjoy!",

I made this gluten free with brown rice spaghetti noodles and it is so good my gluten eating husband declared his 37 year favorite pot roast meal has been replaced. It is very similar to a garlic spaghetti we used to get at a small family Italian restaurant years ago. I made a few changes to accommodate my pantry and being gluten free. First I halved the recipe which makes enough for 2 people to eat to just short of gluttony. I've found it isn't necessary or even desirable to cook gluten free noodles in oily water so I used the olive oil in the garlic/red pepper mix along with the butter. I used 1 teaspoon of dried thyme along with 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil with the garlic for my seasoning. I served this as a side dish with grilled pork loin chops and Italian flatbread and fresh cherry tomatoes. I should also admit to making it twice in four days! It's that good!",
