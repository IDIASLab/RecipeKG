Cutting cabbage is one of my least favorite things to do so I bought the already shredded in a bag. Problem with that is that it was super fine and burnt a little before I could get the beer in. My own fault and I did want a little brown on it so it was all good. I really liked the beer flavor with this. It was really good! I did think it could have used some heat so next time I will add some crushed chili flakes.",
