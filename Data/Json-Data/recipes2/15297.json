I added onion powder and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I used one teaspoon of season salt to cut back on the salt and it was still pretty noticeable. I added a heaping 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper that really was great with it but it still could have used some water-chestnuts. I used about a cup of left-over steamed spinach and could have used more. Over all very good stuff though. It's good to know that yogurt can be used in place of its less nutritious counterparts.",

Last went light on garlic powder in place of the garlic salt. Also added little ground pepper & a little grated Parmesan. With everyones helpful reviews - I think this creation is worth 5 stars!
