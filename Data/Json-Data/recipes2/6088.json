It has a good robust flavor my only complaint is the bitterness that comes through a bit but I guess you would like that if you love Guinness and actually the bitterness reminds me of some very sharp cheeses I've had before. I think this would be a five star for many so I might make it again depending on the crowd. It definately has to sit in the fridge for a while to get really good and it goes a very long way because you only need a little bit on each bite of pretzel. Thanks for the new and interesting recipe!",
