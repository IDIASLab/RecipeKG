        "description": "What is better than a great New England chowder on a cold rainy day or at a family summer BBQ? There are many chowders out there that are either too time-consuming or too expensive for the average family to make. This version is one I have developed for my family and friends that is easy to make, does not break the bank, and also has the best interests of your waistline at heart. In New England you can buy chopped chowder clams at many of our local markets. If you do not have them readily available where you live, you can use canned clams. Serve with oyster crackers or some great garlic bread.",

I also wanted to use up some frozen seafood in the freezer. This fit the bill! ALL our patients loved it! I made just a couple of changes/additions to accommodate what I already had on hand. A large can of clam juice for the seafood stock, imitation bacon bits instead of bacon (I know, I know, but I have a husband who can't stand bacon-go figure!), and frozen tilapia instead of cod. EVEN with all the frozen/canned substitutions, everyone LOVED it! I did add some sherry at the end because... it just goes great with creamy seafood soups! Also... very important.. it was true to time... I love and respect that. Great job, javaqueen!",
