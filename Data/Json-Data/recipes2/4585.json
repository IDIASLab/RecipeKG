They baked at 350 for 15 minutes.  A good adaptable recipe for on the go families.",

For vegetables especially peppers and onions saut\u00e9 them in olive oil or butter with salt and pepper to help add flavor so it is not bland. I add milk to my eggs always and season the eggs with salt and pepper before adding them to the muffin pan. Just be careful that you don't over salt your eggs or saut\u00e9ed vegetables. I also put my vegetables and cheese in the bottom of the muffin cup and then put the egg & milk mixture into a large liquid measuring cup so you can pour it into the muffin cups. I fill the muffin cups almost full about 3/4 full and they will puff up nicely and then can be kept warm in the oven until you are ready to eat. You can also add fresh or dried herbs to your egg mixture to add more flavor to this.",
