Seondly I add a swirl of balsamic vinegar.  I also sometimes add capers in for a nice touch.  I also use a shallot instead of onion but either is fine.  \nI do think it's important to toast the bread before putting the tomato mixture on there, otherwise it's too soggy.  Just drizzle some olive oil on there and salt an pepper and then toast for just a few minutes.  Gives it a nice crunch.",

I have always made the same alterations as most people here- add some minced garlic! The other change I make is to toast the bread alone after i have brushed it with the olive oil. Once it is toasted (heres a trick I learned from a gourmet chef)- you cut 1 or 2 garlic cloves in half width-wise and rub it on the tops of the toasted bread before spooning the tomato mixture onto it. For a kid-friendly recipe, I sprinkle a bit of grated cheddar on top and throw them back under the broiler for 30-60 seconds... Try this recipe! Its wonderful!",
