Not only were the butterscotch chips far more flavorful than the white chocolate used in other recipes but the appearance was outstanding also with the chocolate chips swirled into it. Great recipe extremely easy and highly recommended!! Helpful hint: Line the 8x8 pan with waxed paper first. After candy is hardened lift waxed paper out. This makes both slicing the candy and clean-up easier.",
