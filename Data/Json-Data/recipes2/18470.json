For this one I used silken tofu instead of yogurt added a little lime and used dry beans (soaked and cooked). I left out the chopped tomatoes. I also thought that there was a little something missing so I added a bit of cayenne and salt and here was the trick: brown sugar. I am not sure how much I added (around 2 tbsp) so I would just play with it until it tasted good. Another thought instead of the brown sugar might be golden raisins. Once I added the brown sugar it was DELICIOUS.",

I used frozen spinach brown lentils chickpeas and cherry tomatoes cut in half which added a nice flavor. Despite the lack of meat my husband did not complain and complimented me on the dish. Next time I think I will put in more of the spices and roast them in the pan with the onion and oil. That seems to bring out the flavor in Indian food.",
