If feeling adventurous, you can make \"taco\" flavored chips by placing the hot chips in a paper bag & adding taco seasoning, a pinch of salt & feel free to add things such as hot pepper, chili powder, powdered garlic &/or or onion or my favorite; McCormick's Southwest Seasoning! (it clears your sinuses- WOOOOOOOO!!!)  If the chips are too cool for the seasoning to stick, put them on a cookie sheet in a 350\u00ba oven for 5 minutes & then try this as hot oil is what helps the seasoning stick to the chips.  You can also brush them with vanilla paste or extract after frying & coat them in sugar & cinnamon.  :)  I'm thankful for this \"recipe\" as it means no more rushing out to WholeFoods when we get to craving nachos (they are the only ones who offer flour tortilla chips which are best for my meat, refried beans & cheese laden nachos.)  Thanks!",
