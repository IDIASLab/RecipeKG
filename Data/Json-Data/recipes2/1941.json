They were wonderful! I catch hubby snacking on one every now and again. I was afraid the mustard would be over powering but it was perfect for me. To eat plain they could use a little garlic or something but they would definitely make a nice base for pate or spread just the way they are. Thanks for the recipe Chef John!",
