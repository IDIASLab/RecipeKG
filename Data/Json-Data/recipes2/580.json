I substituted ricotta for 2% small curd cottage cheese (try to drain the liquid a bit before you add it to your mixture) and I added ground beef, a sprinkle of Italian seasoning, oregano, onion and garlic powder to the sauce. I baked it for 55 minutes covered, 5 minutes uncovered to melt the cheese a bit more on top. It was amazing! I'm not a cottage cheese fan but it tasted delicious in the lasagna. It was creamy and full of flavor. My super picky 2 year old (who often skips meals because she doesn't want to eat) licked her plate clean and asked for seconds! THIS NEVER HAPPENS! Thanks for a wonderful recipe and new addition to my dinner list!",

What I plan to do next time is cook the noodles for about five (5) minutes so they aren't really done and still hard enough to where they won't tear easily. I can do it in the same pan I brown my meat in to cut the dish usage. All in all, it's a great idea, it just didn't work as well for me as I thought it might.",
