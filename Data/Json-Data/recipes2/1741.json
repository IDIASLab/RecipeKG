My autistic son even ate them doing his usual thing of cutting off anything charred. I ate mine with fresh diced onions and BBQ sauce. Gave the bacon a smokey flavor. I also used soft French rolls to handle a larger dog and to hold any condiments applied. served with baked beans and fries. Definitely will make again.",
