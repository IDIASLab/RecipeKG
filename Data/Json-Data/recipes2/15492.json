It was way too thick--I ended up using 50% more stock than what it called for. \n\nI also carmelized some shallots instead of green onions, and I cooked both the shallots and the mushrooms in butter before, as the previous folks have said.\n\nTo give it more flavor, I added a 1/2 cup of red wine, 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar, and a couple of tablespoons of Dijon mustard. Oh, and salt and pepper. (It didn't even call for salt and pepper!) I also used some shitake mushrooms instead of all whitecaps; thank goodness I did--I can't imagine how it would have tasted without them.\n\nNext time I'll cook the four and a bit of the butter together to make a roux, so there won't be so many lumps in the sauce, too.\n\nI really think it was inedible, the way the directions have it here (and I'll eat just about anything), but with my modifications it ended up being tasty--like a stroganoff. Without the modifications it would have been a tasteless, white, lumpy paste.",

I used veggie broth as another reviewer suggested since I was serving it with a chicken dish. I also had some leftover white wine that I used in place of some of the broth. The sauce came out much thicker than I thought it would but it was still a very nice sauce. I used the entire 1 pound container of mushrooms chopped in a relatively large dice. I also used 4 or 5 green onions (didn't measure those). I made the sauce in advance and then reheated it adding more veggie broth as it heated to try to thin it out a bit more. It never got very thin but it was a nice consistency. My husband suggested that it would be a great mushroom soup. There are some leftovers that I'm going to play with tonight maybe adding some sour cream or heavy cream or milk to try to make it more like soup. I would definitely make this again. It's extremely easy and dummy-proof for those of us slightly intimidated by making a sauce. I can see a lot of variation possibilities with this recipe and I plan on trying some of them.",
