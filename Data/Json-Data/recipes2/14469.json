I had some fresh thyme and oregano which I cooked with the sauce and then put the rest of the spices (dried) to cook with the chicken so it would have more flavor. There was so much sauce which is good because it is delicious. I served this with fresh garlic & parsley linguine noodles. I also left out the butter & cheese to reduce calories and I swear it wasn't missing a thing. Oh and I cooked the chicken at the same time as the sauce (in a separate pan) to save time. I have some cleaning to do but it was worth it.",

You don't have to stress about the ingredients. Most of them are stuff that you already have in your kitchen cabinet. I didn't have yellow peppers and it still came out great. I might add that if you need some more sauce consider adding another can of tomatoes. Also consider seasoning the chicken breast well enough to make it more flavorful.Otherwise I love this recipe and it's a keeper.",

I substituted a can of Italian Stewed Tomatoes for the diced tomatoes w/green chile peppers. To streamline the process while giving the chicken more flavor AND cut some of the fat I sauteed the chicken chunks with the peppers and fresh garlic in 2 T olive & 2 T butter. I still used the garlic powder as well during this process to ensure there was enough seasoning. Once the chicken was cooked through and the peppers tender I added the two cans of tomatoes and the herbs (heaping 1/2 tsp of each of the three herbs) and let the mixture simmer while I boiled the water and cooked the pasta. This process seemed to have eliminated the comments of bland-tasting chicken and gave a more flavorful sauce. Very tasty not too heavy and delicious leftover!",

I did add a couple TBLS of minced onion when sauting the peppers and added the dry herbs when I added the tomatoes so that they could simmer/add flavor to the \"sauce\" instead of adding them at the end. My daughter thought it was a tad too spicy but she still ate every bite from her bowl. My boyfriend thought this was amazing. Although it takes up a couple pans what are dishwashers for?
