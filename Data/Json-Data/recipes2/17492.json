I bought dried apricots, thinking that would add a little more apricot flavor, but it turned out that the organic apricots are almost black in color and I did not want to do that! (They are not processed with sulfur, which is why they are dark and not that beautiful apricot color).It was delicious just the same. A perfect, light, airy spring/ summer dish. Pretty color.
