There are no seasonings mentioned so if you don't add your own than bland city. I think the reciepe called for too much cream also and the cream tastes very 'raw' or uncooked. It seems it should be added sooner to give it time to blend with the veggies and oysters. I'm a huge oyster fan and this just didn't do it for me.",
