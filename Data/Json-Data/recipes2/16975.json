I have a good amount of Roma tomatoes left over after the Christmas holiday and this was the perfect use for some of them. I went a little lighter on the Parmesan and oregano and added some fresh parsley. Very pretty and very tasty and I think I actually prefer this method of broiling the tomatoes rather than oven baking them. The topping gets all nice and golden without the tomatoes overcooking. I didn't use the MSG not necessarily because I have anything against it but because I don't buy it. We really enjoyed this fresh easy and healthy side dish which also serves as a colorful garnish!",
