I finally picked the raisins and nuts out and used the rest in mashed potatoes. That was quite good.",

It is far more usual to make a yoghurt sauce with yogurt and wild garlic (mast-o-moosir) or yogurt cucumbers and mint (mast-o-khiar) or most commonly to serve plain yoghurt as an accompaniment to rice. Each person gets their own 3-ounce cup of yoghurt and some people eat it directly out of the cup. Also it is very usual for Iranians to cook with very large quantities of herbs so you may need to adjust this recipe to your own taste (there is nothing wrong with the quantities of herbs stated in the recipe). You could make this recipe with Greek yoghurt which is closer to the 13% fat yoghurt sold in Iran (instead of using sour cream as used in this recipe as they don't actually have sour cream in Iran). Thank you for sharing your recipe.",
