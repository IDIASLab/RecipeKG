I left out the cheese, I added a pinch of kosher salt, 1 tablespoon of sugar and added extra butter about 1/4 cup, I really didn't measure, I baked it in a buttered 9x13 cake pan for 40 to 45 minutes, I needed the oven for the rest of the dinner so I took it out about 2 hours, maybe even longer,  before we ate and just set it on the counter the warm temperature was perfect so I love the fact that I was able to use the oven for other dishes and it also free up my time since I was busy preparing a large meal.  It was a winner and since I try so many new recipes the family asked me to keep this one as a regular, it pleased every palate.",

I don't use canned niblet corn, I just fill the empty creamed corn can with frozen corn and use that instead.  I'd consider the addition of some scallions to the mix to add color.  And I swear by Jiffy corn bread mix for this recipe.  I don't use the egg called for in this recipe.  A suggestion to make life easier: I've found this casserole to be a great make ahead option to be microwaved before serving.",

Unfortunately today, I forgot to add the cheese I just reminded myself.  I was wondering if 350 is the right temperature because both times I have made this and it doesn't seem to be done in 30min, maybe it is because I'm not using a square dish?  Also, do I need to drain the niblet corn?  I did just in case.  Well thanks for the awesome recipe.",
