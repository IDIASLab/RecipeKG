Loved the subtleness of the leeks and the beautiful green of the parsley against the creaminess of the potatoes. A very nice attractive dish in a supporting role that won't steal the thunder of a main course. Thank you Bibi for this recipe.",

I don't have a steamer so I just microwaved my potatoes until they were done. The flavor of the leeks, butter and fresh parsley just enhanced the flavor of the potatoes.  The first night I made them, we had 'Pineapple Sticky Ribs', homemade rolls, 'Cran-Broccoli Salad' and 'Rhubarb Raspberry Crunch' for dinner.  All the recipes were found on AR.  I've made the potatoes twice since the first time and I'm taking the items to Kentucky to make them for our kids.  They are delicious, Bibi.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
