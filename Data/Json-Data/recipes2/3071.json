Perhaps it would work better in a food processor? Next time I would add the bananas partially frozen (so they are not hard as a rock!) and blend that way then re-freeze. I added a spoonful of unsweetened cocoa powder and the kids said it tasted like a Frosty from Wendy's! :)",

Just as the cook's notes indicate mix-ins possibilities are endless. With the simplicity of its single ingredient it's wonderful but I've made it again w/ a little vanilla extract chocolate chips and Nutella. /swoon.",
