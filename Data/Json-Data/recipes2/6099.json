I will use 1/2-1 tsp of cayenne-  2 full tsp is FAR over powering, even for my preference being for on the hot side.  I would also add ~1/4-1/2 cup of water during the cooking process.... I think it will help steam the veggies a bit (I like them a bit softer), and once it evaporates off will leave a nice consistency to the sauce.  As it was, I was afraid that the sauce was burning.  I would also sprinkle dish with chopped peanuts and more onion for some crunch.  Awesome recipe... will be using again.  Carrots were awesome in this by the way... :)",
