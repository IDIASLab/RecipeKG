I originally bought a standard sized tub of whipped topping which is only 8oz.  After mixing it, it appeared very thick and pumpkiny.  That's when I realized I needed another tub for the required 16oz. (note also that the pudding package is 5oz, not the standard 3oz). After reading some of the other reviews, I suspect that I am not the only person to do this.  When the proper amounts were used, it turned out great.  Everyone asked for the recipe.",

When I made the changes, the recipe was definately a 5!!!  Everyone requests it and my family loves to dip ginger snaps in it!",
