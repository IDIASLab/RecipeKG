I used part of a red onion, sliced into very thin rings, and added about half \nthe jalapeno, already diced in the can.\nI put all the extras between the 2 slices \nof cheese... seems the melted cheese helps hang on to the tomato, onion and pepper much better than putting it on top... and it's alot easier to flip that way, not to mention a bit less messy to eat. Butter is much better tasting on GC's, and I really wouldn't even TRY them with Margarine. Totally different taste, and the butter browns up so much nicer. I think I may have\n   found my new fave GC right here in this recipe! Next time I'll add a bit more jalapeno! \nThank you, PATELGURL... these GC's rock!",

I used a couple slices of hothouse tomatoes that had been left to \"drain\" on paper towels to remove some of the excess moisture. I used extra sharp white cheddar sliced cheese jarred jalapeno slices and ringed bermuda onion. Very good sandwich. I paired it with organic tomato soup.
