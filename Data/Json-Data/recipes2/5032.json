But then I started to play ...  and now it is the most requested dish from my family.  Changes?\n1. double the carrots and celery and potatoes\n2. heavy cream instead of milk\n3. Ham is always home baked with a lot of cloves\n3. Most important (in addition to the creamed  corn) - I add 3-4 ears of fresh corn right off the cob.  When cooking the vegatables/potatoes - I include the corn cobs for even more corn flavor.\n\nSometimes I will need to add additional stock - I play it by ear",

I didn't have any chicken bouillon celery marjoram or even creamed corn (I just tossed in about a 1/3 cup of half and half to make it a little creamy). I doubled the recipe and realized I only had about a cup of cheddar cheese... so monterey jack was a good stand-in. I don't have a dutch oven so I just whipped it up in my stock pot. I really appreciate a \"base\" recipe and this one proves versatile enough to switch up the players. I'm looking forward to trying it again with whatever else I have leftover in my fridge!:)",
