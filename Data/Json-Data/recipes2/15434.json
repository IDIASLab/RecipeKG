Also the uncooked mixture was very very thick and sticky and it was a chore to spread it into the 9 X 13 baking pan. I finally had to grease a stirring spoon and smooth the mixture into the pan. I can only warn others to not waste their time & energy (and costly ingredients) making something that no one in their right mind would eat!",
