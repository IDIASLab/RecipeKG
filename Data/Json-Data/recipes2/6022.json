With that being said even after reading the reviews and tweaking the ingredients it was just a 3.5 star recipe with a half a star for creativity. I omitted the sumac because we don't care for lemon/lime flavoring in food with the exception of fish. I doubled all the ingredients except for the liver and added a can of sliced water chestnuts with a small bag of snow peas. I dredged the liver (cut in to cubes) through seasoned flour pan fried in shallow oil and placed on paper towel to drain. I knew from experience that if I added the raw liver to the veggies that it looks like a horrible pink mess. After tasting the veggie mix I added 1 tbsp of Badia Complete Seasoning and an inch of anchovy paste. I served it in a bowl with 1/2 cup of chicken flavored rice topped with a generous helping of veggie mix. I added the liver on top so it didn't get soggy too fast.",
