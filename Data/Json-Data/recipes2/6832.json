The salmon needs seasoning - salt & pepper at the minimum, but I chose to use some blackened seasoning that I had left (recipe also from this site).  Grilling the salmon would have been great too, but I chose to broil it in the oven, because it was freezing out today, and I wasn't about to fire up the grill.  I used my own roasted peppers (the ones in the jar just don't cut it for me), and I subbed fresh parsley for the cilantro, in keeping with more Italian flavors.  The sauce is so good!  I love the addition of the parmesan, which gives it a creamy texture.  We all enjoyed this recipe, and I will make it again.  Thanks!",
