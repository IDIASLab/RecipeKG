I was a bit skeptical at first, but it smelled terrific and the taste was amazing!  Very simple recipe, but great flavor!! Took it to a potluck dinner and the pan was scraped clean! My family begged me to make it again the next day because some of them didn't get it at the potluck. \nThe only change I made was to use crushed Cool Ranch Doritos instead of the crackers, so that the recipe would be gluten-free.",

I doubled the recipe and I can't even describe what a hit this was with mine AND my hubby's family! The butter (use a real stick of butter not margarine!!) sour cream and parmesan cheese turns into the yummiest sauce you could imagine for vidalia onions! All I added was minced garlic freshly ground sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Also make sure to use a few extra crackers in the topping and mix the cracker crumbs with a little butter Yum!",

It was a good dish but it's VERY rich a little goes a long way!",
