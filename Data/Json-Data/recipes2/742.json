Made it twice yesterday, with a few changes; \ntook the advise of another reviewer and made it in my oven's broiler setting. 7 inches from the heat source. Only brushed garlic infused olive oil, garlic power, garlic salt & black course pepper.  Took 5 min. once out sprinkled with crumbled blue cheese & OMG turned out great. Next time will drizzle it with a bit of lemon juice or balsamic before sprinkling it blue cheese. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe with us all.",
