I have a juicer, but don't use it anymore due to it removing too much of the fiber. To make juice in my Vitamix blender, I have to just add water. I made 1/3 of a recipe and used a frozen chopped peach because I didn't have fresh. I added the peach, 1/3 of a peeled sweet apple, 1/2 cup of water to turn them to juice, some mint leaves, and a tsp of lemon juice due to not having lime juice. It worked fine. I blended for about 1 1/2 minutes, or so, until it resembled a juice and everything was completely emulsed. I oddly felt the jump of energy notated by the recipe submitter.",
