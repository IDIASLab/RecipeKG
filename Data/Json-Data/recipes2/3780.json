However, I just can't leave well enough alone & each time I try it, I make a few modifications because my family can be brutally honest sometimes. So far the favorite is to add half baby spinach & half arugula, add some feta, and some dried cranberries. Cut down on the salt because the feta adds salt, and add a little more pepper. My family likes lots of pepper. Make sure you roast the beets. If you boil them it changes the flavor for sure. Hey, that's the great thing about these recipes, we all have different tastes but you should at least try the recipe as is & then modify slightly to suit your palette.",
