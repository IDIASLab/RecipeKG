Turns out I think they would have just got lost in all of it but that is only my opinion. I say use a piece of sliced mozzarella in their place. Again, just my opinion. I did use fresh oregano because I always use fresh herbs instead of dried if I have them on hand but dried would have worked just fine too. This is a fun recipe and one the kiddo's will love!",
