I used Franks wing sauce for the hot sauce on one potato and Sriracha on the second, cooking in two separate batches. Both were amazingly good. I served them with McCormick's Utah Fry Sauce. Yum!

Most of mine were floppy so next time I'll bake them on a cookie rack in the sheet pan so they can maybe do less steaming. I did a regular potato with these and its texture was crisp so I think sweet potatoes must be wetter inside. These were a hit my 4yo ate 3 fries and that's amazing considering how much she hates potatoes! Thanks!",
