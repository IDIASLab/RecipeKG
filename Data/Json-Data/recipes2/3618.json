I never refrigerate the tomatoes and left off the dressing just using a little olive oil vinegar salt and pepper. Once the chicken came off the grill I topped it with the tomato mixture fresh basil and some shredded Parmesan and Romano cheese. Great served wtih \"Warm Herb Garlic Bread\" from this site.",

I made the topping with our garden tomatoes the red onion and fresh basil. For some reason I didn t think the topping was all that flavorful.
