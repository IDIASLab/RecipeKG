I followed the recipe as closely as I could, though I'm sure I used more cauliflower than called for.  I don't actually own a grater at the moment, so I minced the ginger. I used hot madras curry powder, a little more than called for by the recipe (I kind of spilled it) and it was not too spicy.  This needs something, but I really don't know what.  \n\nI will probably make this again because it was okay...just not great...and experiment to see what could be done.",

Before I added the salt the flavors weren't coming together well but salt made all the difference!! I found this recipe an hour before dinner so I made it in a pot on the stove. Worked beautifully. I boiled the chicken to almost done before then added everything else- minus the coconut milk and frozen peas- which were added at the end like the original recipe. Will definitely be making this again!",
