Your home oven will not be wide enough for the typical 3.5-4 foot long loaves from the bakery. Not a bad thing you don\u2019t have to fish leaf pieces out of your bread. The lard is a MUST. Made it with butter and it\u2019s just not the same. My starter has been going for over 6 months now. Just feed it with equal portions flour and water after each use.",

I followed the recipe as written although I used half bread flour and half all purpose.  I subbed in  Crisco shortening for the lard because it has the same texture.  The loaves rose nicely and turned out beautifully golden. I did place a pan of water in the oven during baking.  The bread has a crispy thin crust and a tender inside.  The flavor was great with a slightly sweet profile. For my taste, the bread was a tad salty so when I make it again, I will add 1.75 teaspoons of salt.",
