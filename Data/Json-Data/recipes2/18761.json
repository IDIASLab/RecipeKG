I also add 1 - 2 finely chopped jalapenos (depending on the amount of heat wanted).  This recipe is easy to make and sooooo delicious!",

I also used about 4 cloves of garlic that I roasted the other day instead of one raw minced clove.  I let it marinade...the flavor was good...I liked the taste of the red wine vinegar.  But something was lacking, there wasn't enough \"bite\" for me in it.  And I don't really see what the feta added besides calories; it added no extra flavor or texture that was necessary.  So I added about 1/2 can corn and 3/4 can black beans.  Now I have something to munch on!  I will make it again, but with corn and beans in place of feta.",

I would probably never have come up with this combination of ingredients on my own, but it works!  Definitely go with the cilantro over the oregano/parsley.  The beauty of this recipe is that you really don't have to follow the ingredient quantities too closely.  I just kept adding (and tasting, naturally!) until I had the desired amount, adjusting the seasoning accordingly.  This one's a keeper!",
