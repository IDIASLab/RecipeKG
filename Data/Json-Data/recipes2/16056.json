Salty but not as bad as other reviewers make it seem.  Rich but not too rich. \r\n\r\n After I made it the recipe way the first time, I added fresh sliced tomatoes the second.

I also skipped the mayo like I did the first time.  \r\nI've been making this with plain white bread and it works fine although I'm sure french bread or some other bread like foccacia would be awesome.\r\nA tip I have when making grilled cheese sandwiches of any kind is to use partially or completely frozen bread.  The bread will hold together better and you won't break it when you slather on the margarine or butter.  It doesn't add to the cooking time and you end up with a nicer looking sandwich!\r\n",

I forgot to buy the colby-jack so I used shredded cheddar and they were great. Also because my husband is convince a meal without meat is only a snack I added some sliced deli ham. The ham makes it a little more difficult to eat the sandwiches as they tend to slide apart. I also added a little fresh cracked pepper and dried dill weed to mine. I will make these again for sure. They are very filling fast and easy to make. Thanks Sarah for a great weekend lunch recipe that is not boring.",
