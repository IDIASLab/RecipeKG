But I bet it would be so good poured over chips to make some nachos or as a base for taco salad. Next time I may add in a block of cream cheese just to see how much richer and creamier I can get it. Thanks for this yummy recipe! UPDATE: I have made this a few times now and it is so good! I do always add in a bit of cream cheese (maybe half a block to a full 8 oz. block to the full recipe depending on how cheesy I want it). I really think it turns it up a notch. Most times if I want just a good cheese dip I make this without the chicken in it and it makes an excellent queso cheese dip. I do add a bit more onion. Also this was great to heat up and stay warm in a crockpot. This is my favorite all time queso dip! Thanks again for the recipe!",
