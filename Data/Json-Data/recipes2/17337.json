I didn't have any key lime juice so I ended up using regular lime juice...and then it turned out that I didn't have enough of that so I ended up subbing lemon juice for the remainder.:P Even so the chicken came out moist tender and juicy with a great lime/honey flavor. I marinated the chicken overnight and then grilled it for lunch today. It was wonderful and my family really enjoyed it. Plus it was super easy and quick to put together. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!!",
