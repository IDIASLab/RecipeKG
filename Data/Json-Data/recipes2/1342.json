However - didn't have time, had ribs, so I took the ingredients and threw the lot in the slow cooker on low for 7 hours.  I cut the pineapple juice a bit, used sriracha instead of chili paste, but left everything else pretty much as is.  I did flip the ribs a few times.  It was delicious regardless!  Next time I will try doing it according to the recipe.",

I doubled the basting sauce because I like them extra flavourful, but if I was making 5his again as a main dish meat, I would cut it back to the regular amount of sauce. As an appetizer I would double the sauce and probably cute the ribs into singles after the first 1 1/2 or so, but that does not take anything away from the recipe.
