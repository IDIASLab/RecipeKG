My only change was that I used lactaid milk and sour cream but no one could tell that. The 2 round cake pans cooked much quicker...my cakes were done in 35 minutes. As ovens vary I would just caution you to check your cake after 30 minutes. My family loved the raspberry cake! I also added lemon pudding as a filling between the 2 cakes...simply delicious!",
