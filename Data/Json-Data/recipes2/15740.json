I used fresh veggies and sauteed them in olive oil. I had to add quite a bit of salt to acheive the flavor I like and I served this in a warmed tortilla with shredded cheese like the previous reviewer suggested. I used store bought enchilada sauce which I really like but I'm wondering if I should have gone with homemade. I doubt it would have made that much of a difference. As far as being quick and inexpensive it's deserving of all 5 stars but the taste lacked something to be desired. I served this with picante sauce on the side. Maybe adding some more spices to the vegetables while their cooking would help. Glad I gave it a shot.",
