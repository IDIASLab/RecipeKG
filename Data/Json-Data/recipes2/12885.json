Save the inner sack/liner of your next box of cereal or crackers.  The flexible bag that is so hard to open most of the time.  It is perfect for pounding almost anything and doesn't break, tear or leak.  Then you just throw it away once you're finished.  I've used them for years and especially like how it holds up when I'm pounding boneless chicken breasts to flatten them.  So try this easy tip and happy holiday cooking to all!",

I loved the white almond bark the best. I quadrupled the recipe 24 ounces of Almond Bark to 12 regular sized peppermint sticks. I prefer to crush the peppermint sticks very well otherwise they stick in your teeth. I put in a jelly roll pan and chilled for 1 hour. YUMMO! This makes a more chunkier bark which I loved. I have even done the Chocolate Bark White Almond bark and even did a layer of chocolate bark chilled for an hour a layer of White Almond bark on top chilled for another hour. It was good but the White Almond bark is my families favorite. I even told a friend about this recipe and she made it for her family this Christmas. They loved it too. It's easy and cheap and tastes like store bought. Merry Christmas!",
