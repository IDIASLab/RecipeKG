First time I made just like recipe stated except I did not use fresh mint. We loved it. I did mix all together and added the dressing right before serving. The second time I made it for a girls night out and tripled the recipe! IT was a big hit and is diffently a keeper. Everyone is amazed at the mint/apple jelly. It gives it a very nice and different taste.Try it and you'll enjoy.",

First of all it is beautiful with the colors and the layered look so it makes an impression before anyone even tastes it. Then the apple/mint jelly takes 'em by surprise and the raving continues. I couldn't find apple mint jelly so I bought both apple and mint and used 2TBSP of apple and 1TBSP of mint. I mixed the chopped mint in with the dressing too and applied the dressing just before serving. I also struggled with the avocado at first not able to get pretty slices. Finally I sliced it in half long ways and removed the pit. Then I turned each half open side down and sliced it like you would a pepperoni. Then the skin peeled off each slice surprisingly easily.",

Can't wait to make it the right way!! I followed the reviews and chopped the melon and avocado but i did have to heat the vinegar and jelly and mint sauce (I found this amazing sauce while shopping for apple mint jelly - it has malt vinegar white vinegar sugar and egyptian mint leaves so i used that and added an extra bit of white wine vinegar); i simmered the full dressing recipe on the stovetop for about 20 minutes on low heat to break down the jelly and bring out the garlic...It was so aromatic and the flavors were amazing. What a fantastic easy and elegant salad!!",
