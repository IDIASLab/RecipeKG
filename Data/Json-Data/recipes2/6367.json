Melted the brie in the pasta and topped it with the 'salsa.' Cooked the shrimp in the water as it was heating. Took them out put the pasta in and prepared the rest while it was cooking. 2- Cut out mango open and it was brown so we used half frozen mango and half frozen pineapple that we had. Works just as well with pineapple in my opinion.",
