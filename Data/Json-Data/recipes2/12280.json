The Dijon and paprika give it a rustic look. Experiment with flavored oil, olives, and vinegars.  I used Persian lime olive oil. This recipe can be modified easily, including adding crispy bacon to it. Enjoy!",

I've never been a huge fan of mayo dressed salads so this hit the spot for me. I did leave out the cilantro since that seemed odd with the other ingredients. It doesn't have a very appetizing appearance due to the dull green of the pickles combined with the pinkish dressing (from the paprika). I think if I brought it to a party people would look at it suspiciously and it would sit untouched! No problem if you're not taking it on the road though.",
