I also poked holes in the cooled cake before I poured on the pineapple. I toasted the coconut which I think made a big difference and I left out the nuts and the cherries. The nuts just cause so many people don't like nuts and it was for a party and the cherries cause I think it just didn't need it. The toasted coconut on top was perfect. It was GREAT the next day form the refrigerator too. Such an awesome cake and so easy to make.",

Making it in the larger pan really helps since the cake is a little shallower, so the pineapple is able to make it moister.  It is even better the next day after it is made.  I made it using the lite cream cheese and lite cool whip, also used honey roasted macadamia nuts and coconut on top, omitting the cherries since they \"bleed\" onto the topping and I made it the night before the Hawaiian Party we had.

Better ingredients/directions in my opinion: Only SLIGHTLY drain pineapple. Use ONLY 1 cup cold milk in pudding (or topping will lack flavor if use the 2 cups per pudding directions). Toasted pecans are much better. Cherries are optional. REVISED DIRECTIONS: Prepare cake mix according to directions EXCEPT USE THAT DRAINED JUICE for part of water. Be sure to bake in right size pan 10 x 15 (jellyroll) for around 20 minutes but toothpick test in center at 15. Don't ovecook. Allow to cool. Poke holes in cake & spread pineapple & its remaining juice over cake. In bowl beat the SOFTENED cream cheese. Then add pudding mix & only 1 cup cold milk & beat till thickened a little. Top cake with this mixture. (No need to fold in Cool Whip.) Now top with Cool Whip. Sprinkle with coconut chopped toasted nuts & if desired drained cherries. I used some canned cherry pie filling instead. Refrigerate. Best next day.",
