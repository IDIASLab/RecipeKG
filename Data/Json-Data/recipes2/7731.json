One batch was rolled into lasagna sheets, another into longer, thinner sheets for raviolis, and the last was rolled to the 6th setting on my kitchenaid roller attachment and then processed into linguine. This stuff was delicious.  It broke really easily, so maybe I'll stick to the fifth setting for cutting noodles. I rolled them to 6th this time because  earlier in the week, I made a batch of regular pasta and only rolled it to the 4th before cutting it into pappardelle. Those noodles came out a touch too chewy for my taste. I was going for al dente.  I've yet to make the lasagna or the ravs and If I can edit this post I'll update it with the outcome of those, too.",
