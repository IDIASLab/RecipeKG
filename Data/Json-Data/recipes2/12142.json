One morning I decided to double the sausage gravy batch and try out a new recipe - biscuits and gravy pizza! Absolutely amazing. Now my family asks for this just as much as the standard biscuits and gravy. The recipe calls for about half of the amount of gravy that is made; we either make two pizzas with it, or freeze the rest for a later date!",

As soon as the sausage was done I dumped in the flour and started making the gravy. Instead of one large pre-baked pizza crust I decided to do individual pizza's and this worked really good. This is a great recipe! Thanks for sharing!",
