Quick easy and actually pretty filling since I used a nice hearty multi-grain bread! I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a few shakes of Worcestershire and THAT really made it savory and yummy! Next time I might add it to the egg mixture before dipping the bread - oh and since it was just me I used egg substitute so I could just use a splash and not \"waste\" any leftover egg.
