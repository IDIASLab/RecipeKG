I don't have a large (6 muffin) muffin tin so I used ramekins instead. It took about 11 minutes for the egg whites to set up and then I turned the oven to broil and let them in an extra minute on broil before removing them to add the cheese as runny egg whites freak me out! I used a fancy shredded Italian cheese blend that has provolone mozzarella asiago romano and parmesan in it as that's what I had on hand. I also just cooked the proscuitto in a pan on the stove top. Thanks for sharing your recipe!",
