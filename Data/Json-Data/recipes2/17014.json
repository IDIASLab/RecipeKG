The taste of garlicy brie cheese was heavenly!!  I also substituted a ripe pear for one mango (as I only had one) and it turned out great!  I added a pinch of salt and about 1/2 tsp of sugar to the mango/pear mixture as it cooked to enhance the flavours of the fruit.  Next time, I would make DOUBLE the amount of mango sauce as it is a terrific topper for basmati rice - maybe it would be even better with a splash of coconut milk?  I may also add some finely minced fresh cilantro to the mango mixture the next time I try this.  For those of you who are concerned about the amount of fat in the brie cheese, use some light mozzarella cheese instead.  This was so refreshing!!",

The flavors didn't work as well together as I would have thought. The brie gets a little lost. I'd make it again, but I'll have to play around with the ingredients, maybe a less flavorful fish or a stronger-tasting cheese. One warning - make sure your mangos are very ripe, or you won't have a sauce, you'll have caramelized mango chunks. Mine were way to underripe to turn into a sauce. We still enjoyed them as a \"warm mango salsa\" sort of thing, but if you're looking for an actual sauce, start with mushy mangos.",

The only problem that I ran into is that the brie melted almost completely off the salmon but I just layered more brie on before ladling the mago sauce on. For the mango topping the mangos I started with were a bit unripe so I took another reviewers advice and blended them in the blender first. I think this greatly facillitated with making it smooth for the unblended chunks never got smooth on their own. I also added some lemon juice some brown sugar and a pinch of cayenne pepper. It was great over the rice I served on the side. Be prepared to make extras but don't expect any leftovers everything was scraped clean! This is one of my favourite recipes and the only reason it isn't getting 5 stars is because of how much I changed it. Have fun with it!",

At the very end laid the brie on top to melt-- which only took a couple of minutes-- the cedar board added a great smokey flavor to it all. As for the sauce on other reviewers suggestion I added a pinch of cayanne pepper. I used jarred mangoes and added a tiny bit of the juice from the jar as well so that they could cook up better. They didnt get completely smooth which could be remedied by putting in blender however we liked the sauce just fine with the small chunks of mango.",
