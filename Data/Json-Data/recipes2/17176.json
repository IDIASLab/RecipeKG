I would like to offer a couple of tips - either add more cranberries or do a course chop of the cranberries so that each bite has some - a bite of this without a piece of the cranberries isn't nearly as good. In addition to the pecans in the spread I sprinkle the outside with the finely chopped glazed pecans. This is hard to spread so make sure you plate it with a small knife- next time I might add a bit of sour cream to make it a bit more spreadable. Thanks for a nice recipe.",
