I had asked my mom about them and she and she had no recollection but looked this up and it is the same as we used to make. I didn't care for the celery seed though so next time just skip it altogether and it was bland as far as seasoning so also next time I think I'll use season all in the meat. I stuffed these with colby jack cheese and onions. Except for being a bit bland they were good so that is all I need to adjust. I cooked these on the stovetop 4 min per side.",
