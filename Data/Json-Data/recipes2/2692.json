The second time, I added 2 homegrown jalape\u00f1os, which added a nice, but not overpowering, kick.\n Instead of doing this on a cookie sheet and wire rack, which is awful to clean, you can hang the pieces with toothpicks or bamboo skewers from the top oven rack. Be sure to line the bottom oven rack with aluminum foil to catch drips. Make sure none of the meat is touching other pieces or folded on itself, it wont dry with the rest. And wedging the oven door open with a wooden spoon helps with drying time.",

My family really enjoyed this jerky!  I will NEVER buy commercial jerky again!  The taste of homemade jerky is so much better (and without all the unhealthy additives that often goes into commercial jerky)!  I will be making this many times, as we enjoy jerky a lot! ~ OH, I cut up some into tiny pieces for doggie treats .. my two dogs love 'em, too!
