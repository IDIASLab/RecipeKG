I used minced garlic vs. garlic powder and since I didn't have fines herbs I used a blend of parsley tarragon and marjoram. I used this on a sirloin steak and let it marinate for 10 hours. It had a nice flavor and the wine didn't overpower it. It also had a nice sweetness that came through. Overall very good.",
