                "reviewBody": "I doubled this for my family of 5 (2 adults 3 kids)and had no left overs. I did substitute due to the fact my grocery store was limited so I grabbed the closest thing. I used a can of pinto bean and the pinto beans with the chili sauce (loads of extra flavor!). Instead of 14 total ounces of the green Chile s I used half which was 2 of the smaller cans. For the tomatoes I used a 10 oz can of fire roasted rotel and regular fire roasted tomatoes in the 14 oz can. I totally forgot to thaw the chicken the day before so I defrosted a little over 2 lbs of frozen chicken in the microwave right before cooking and it came out to a little over 4.5 cups when I chopped it up. I seasoned the raw chicken with the homemade seasoning salt recipe from AR. I also did not cook the chicken until I got to the step in the recipe...OOPS! I cooked it through and then proceed with the rest. Overall very filling easy and cheap. It was delicious and my picky eaters loved it. They said I needed to put it on my make again list lol. This would be a good filling for tortillas also. I added cheese to the final product and a tablespoon or 2 of sour cream. We also really enjoyed the corn! I ll probably add 3 cups next time this is made.",
