'grill seasoning' also isn't something common here, so i made mine using 1 tbs fresh coarse ground black pepper, 1 tsp kosher salt, onion power, garlic power and ground coriander each, and 1/3 tsp crushed red pepper flakes. but!  it was absolutely delicious.  i served it with roasted potatoes, carrots, parsnips & shallots, and it went down a treat. the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because i suspect that the reason the meat wasn't more tender is because i used meat from the freezer.  also, we're not big eaters, but there's no way 1 pound of venison would divide between 4 people.  3 at a push maybe. nice one, i'll be making it again. :)",
