I didn't add the chili powder because I wasn't sure how it would taste and I didn't want to ruin a perfectly good cup of hot chocolate so I wimped out on that part. I had to add 3/4 of a cup of cold milk because my chocolate was really sweet and I didn't strain mine. I had to reheat it a bit but it tasted really good and I like the idea of using chips rather than cocoa powder. Thanks Drew.",

It's one of those days anyway where I'm craving chocolate in any way shape or form. I didn't have any chocolate chips in the house so I subbed with Hershey's syrup. I was literally eating spoonfuls of the syrup as I was making this. Well Mr. Drew I must say that this is absolutely fantastic!!!! I'm sipping as I'm writing and LOVING every taste. I'll definitely make this for the kids when they get home. Thanks so much!",
