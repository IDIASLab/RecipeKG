Remember that the carrot and pineapple are already sweet so I reduced the white sugar from 2 cups to 1 cup (so much better). The oil I used was 1/2 cup of coconut oil (melted). I didn't use butter only coconut oil and it's perfect. This would be a healthier version if you need to watch your sugar intake.",

Checked at 40 mins and it was done (will check sooner next time).  First time using coconut oil, so I assumed 'unrefined' for this recipe (to lend some flavor).  Seems to have been the right choice, everyone who tried the cake said it was fantastic. My family prefers things not super sweet, so I only used 2 cups conf sugar in the frosting, which was perfect for us.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe... my 92 year old grandmother loves carrot cake and it makes me happy to bake one from scratch for her.",
