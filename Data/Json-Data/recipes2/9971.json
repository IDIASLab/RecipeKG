It definitely takes some muscle power but they turn out so cute in the end you'll be glad you did it. I had a handful of sliced olive that needed used so I threw them in there too. You could pretty much put anything in them you like. Super fun recipe and one I will not only make again but will I be trying other toppings and varieties. Thanks for sharing!",

Used my own marinara sauce for same reason. \n\nI took a small custard cup with about 2 Tbsp of Olive in it, and used a brush to wipe both sides of the tortillas lightly. \n\nAdded a smear of my sauce, some onions, green peppers, a couple slices of pepperoni and about 1-2 OZ of shredded mozzarella between them.  \n\nBaked at 400 F for 12 min on a wire rack over sheet pan. The oil on the tortillas browned them up crunchy and flaky, and while they were delicious, still no substitute for actually making your own yeast dough if you have the time.",
