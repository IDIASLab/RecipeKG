Froze bags on side so blocks were long wide and thinner as opposed to a thick block. Took mix out 2 hours before shower and it turned into a perfect slush/sludge. Added 3 liters (not 2) of Gigerale and Rasberry Soda and mixed to right consistency. Couldn't find Rasberry Gingerale but Walmarts had Gingerale and Rasberry soda (mixed about 1/4-1/3 Rasberry to Gingerale). I made a Cranberry-Rasberry ice ring. Colors were beautiful mix was delicous! Thanks for this recipe.",

I removed it from the freezer one hour prior to the event and then added the ginger ale at event time. All I had was a frozen block floating in the ginger ale - certainly couldn't serve my guests that!!! As guests arrived I was hurredly scraping the frozen block trying to speed it along and needless to say this didn't make for a very pleasant situation when I had guests to attend to. Also add 3 liters of ginger ale instead of 2. It was rather thick. Guests seemed to enjoy it and it disappeared fast.",
