I also used 1 cup of diced raw carrots instead of cooked carrots diced 1 red bell pepper used traditional rice noodles doubled the soy and sweet chili sauces and left out the baby corn. The result was a wonderfully flavored fresh and healthy dish that my entire family (including 3 young boys) loved. To keep noodles from getting mushy make sure you run cold water over the noodles stirring them at the same time. If They're left hot they'll keep cooking a bit resulting in over cooked noodles. Bite into one before removing from water to make sure it's the consistency you want then follow with the cold water. Definitely a keeper.",

I found the mint created an odd taste Ive never eaten a cold noodle dish so that was a little different for me also the noodles did not mix well with the rest of the ingredients. I even rinsed them in cold water and added a few tablespoons of olive oil to prevent clumping and it still didn't mix very well. Maybe it was because I used rice noodles instead of egg. I will give it 4/5 stars because I do think it has potential just not for me.",
