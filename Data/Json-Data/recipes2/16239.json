I left off the guac but put on extra avocado slices after it came out of the oven. Used light mayo. Baked at 400 for 8-9 minutes.",

My husband didn't want me to 'waste' time broiling it (because he was starving - aren't they always?) but couldn't stop saying 'Oh my God this is so good!' while he was eating it. That's a good sign I think;-) I have also done this on a croissant - awsome! I'm making this again tonight for dinner and I will continue to broil before eating. Thanks for the great post!",
