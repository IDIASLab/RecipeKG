I dried the eggs off before encasing in the corned beef and had a slight problem with it adhering to the egg after deep frying. I think that a tablespoon or 2 might help as a binder to the hash. Looking forward to making them for our hungry grandsons. I also made my own Bearnaise sauce rather than the mustard sauce. Thank you Nicole!",
