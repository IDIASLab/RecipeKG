Too salty could be caused by the salmon (if the person who smoked it left it sitting in the brine too long it gets too salty) the capers (if concerned rinse them before use to totally get rid of salt brine) or the chips/crackers you're eating the stuff on. But for what it's worth I didn't rinse the capers and I used salted crackers so if you find it too salty I'd probably point the finger at your smoked salmon.",
