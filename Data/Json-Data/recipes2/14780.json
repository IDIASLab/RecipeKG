I have to double the recipe just to make them last. One very helpful tip: I mix the marshmallows and chow mein noodles in a large bowl and set aside. After melting together the peanut butter and butterscotch morsels remove the mixture from the heat and let it cool a few (3-5) minutes (otherwise the marshmallows will melt). After cooled for a few minutes pour over marshmallow/noodle mixture and toss with a spatula until completely coated. Then quickly drop them by spoonfuls onto waxed paper to set. So quick and easy to make. Delicious!",

It's must easier than the microwave because the butterscotch is a pain to melt. (2) Regardless of melting method melt the butterscotch about halfway before adding the peanut butter. I never could get the butterscotch melted all the way when I melted them at the same time. (3) Don't try to reheat the butterscotch mixture! I didn't have all the ingredients my first run and tried this and mutilated it. Hope this is helpful! Nice little treat!",
