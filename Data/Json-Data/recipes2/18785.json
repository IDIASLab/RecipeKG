Before breading the croquettes chill them for an hour and also instead of flour use japanese panko breadcrumbs. It's a much nicer texture and contrast than flour. All in all it was great recipe we ate it with a Japanese plum dipping sauce made with umeboshi plums.",

The only thing I would suggest is to not use flour just drege in egg batter then panko.  (plain bread crumbs aren't the same.  Panko is a must.) Soy sauce is really not necessary.  Green onions and a little pepper to your taste are great.  I like to eat these with a little yellow mustard, but the rest of my family uses tonkatsu or the kids use ketchup.  Yummy!!!  ",
