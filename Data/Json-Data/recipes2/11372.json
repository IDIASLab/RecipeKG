I added more chocolate syrup and more hot sauce (I like that little zing that surprises you). You can taste layers of flavor in this iced coffee without one dominating. And it just doesn t get much easier than this. Very refreshing and nutritionally friendly as well. This reviewer is an Allrecipes Allstar.
