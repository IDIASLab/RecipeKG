On the rare occasions Hubs goes out of town on a business trip without me I look for a dinner to prepare for myself that is easily scaled to one serving so main dish salads seem to work perfectly for me. I sure do find some good ones including this particular salad. I made the salad itself just as written no changes no substitutions the ingredients were all good choices that blended well together and I especially liked the addition of the avocado which was SO delicious with the pistachio coated chicken. But I did make some changes to how I prepared the chicken. I couldn t see the pistachios sticking very well to the chicken breast as the recipe was written so I first soaked the chicken in buttermilk then coated it in a mixture of the finely chopped pistachios and panko bread crumbs. Just as I suspected the mixture coated the chicken thoroughly. As for the dressing I used some vinaigrette I had leftover from another recipe I tried recently and it couldn t have been a better choice for this salad. I m not typically a fan of cold and crunchy dinners but this one was a real winner with me that I d happily make again in a heartbeat.",

The only reason I gave this three instead of five stars is the expense of the ingredients and the fact that my grocery store doesn't carry shelled pistachios. With the expense and amount of work I am not sure this recipe is a repeater for us. I also don't see much flavor/texture gained by coating the chicken (a more labor intensive approach) vs. just toasting and sprinkling with nuts afterwards. Also if you don't flatten the chicken and/or fillet it you'll burn the pistachios before the chicken is even close to done.",
