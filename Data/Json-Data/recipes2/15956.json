I did replace the bell pepper with diced canned chilies as I didn t have a pepper on hand and thought the mild chilies were in keeping with the Fiesta theme. I also used hominy in place of the corn just personal preference. When the soup was done I did a taste test and although good it simply didn t shout FIESTA I personally prefer a more spicy and robust flavor. I proceeded to add cumin oregano fresh minced garlic original Rotel tomatoes and a wedge of jalapeno pepper. I removed the jalapeno and discarded after the soup had simmered a bit. I also increased the amount of broth. I made my own chicken stock and added the rice directly to the pot. I had made lobster stew for my husband and made this soup for myself as he doesn t care for hominy. For lunch we were having leftovers hubby took a taste of this soup and fell in love with it had to heat him a bowl! Said he liked the hominy in this dish! What a shock! Give the hominy a whirl its bland flavor compliments the spicy flavors and the chewy texture makes for a nice comfort food. A definite keeper with the changes.",
