The spice choices are excellent especially the red pepper flakes which provide just the right level of bite. I only had enough cheddar cheese to cover half of the hash so I used a couple of pepper jack slices to cover the rest. Honestly the pepper jack side was better (of course I ate some from BOTH sides whaddayathink!)because it compliments and continues the red pepper flake theme. I don't see any reason for the rice to be \"cold.\" The rice I used was still warm and it worked great. Thanks for a great down-home recipe!",
