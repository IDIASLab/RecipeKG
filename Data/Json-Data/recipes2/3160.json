I had a craving for something sweet but didn't feel like making muffins so I looked up this recipe and made a half batch (because I only had one package of chocolate chip muffin mix to begin with). Tips: I added a handfull of white chocolate chips to add color and make them more decadent. Definately have to use ROLOS for your carmel candy. Follow the directions in #2 above you want to add that carmel immediately after pulling cookies from the oven and before you take them off the cookie sheet. Doing so helps melt the carmel correctly. Push it in just enough so that you don't blow apart your cookie. I then let them sit a minute and go back and delicatlely pushed down on the carmel to help it spread out more let them sit a few more minutes then I took a toothpick and swirled the carmel lightly.",
