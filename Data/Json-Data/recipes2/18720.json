As modified i likeed both the ease and taste. --2 avocado peeled and cut into bite-size chunks (make sure avocados not too ripe. Stores better and longer if avocado a little green) --2 medium cans of diced tomatoes and 1 medium can of diced tomatoes with chilis (all very well drained). Omitted chilis green onions hot sauce and roma tomatoes. --Zest and juice of one lime --Large bunch of cilantro (finely chopped) (fresh cilantro is key to taste) --1 tablespoon of store bought minced garlic (the fresh garlic was a little raw tasting) --1 can whole kernel corn (drained; we like the taste of vacuum packed corn best) --2 cans black beans rinsed and drained --1/4 cup Red Wine Vinegar --1/4 olive oil --salt and pepper to taste. Mix all together and store in refrigerator. Makes a great side that goes with so many things--chips crackers or just by itself. I've shared this recipe with many people. We LOVE poor man caviar",

I used 3 avocados and after I chop them up I squeeze some lemon or lime juice on the avocado red onion instead of green onion and about a 1/3 cup of chopped cilantro. I have tried it with the dressing listed in the recipe and also tried it with Italian dressing and liked the Italian dressing better. Make sure your avocados are firm yet ripe. Don't mix everything until all of the ingredients are in the bowl. The more you stir it the uglier it looks.I have also used canned tomatoes instead of fresh and it worked out fine - just drain the tomatoes well. A can of rotell tomatoes adds that extra heat if desired. This one is a keeper. Great with the Frito lay scoops! ADD SOME CILANTRO - IT MAKES IT EVEN BETTER!!",
