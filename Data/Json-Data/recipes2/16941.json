I went ahead and measured out a cup of barbecue sauce but only added a little bit at a time until I had the perfect consistency. I ended up using right at 3/4 cup and it was perfect. We really enjoyed these burgers. Instead of plain Monterey Jack I kicked it up a notch with Pepper Jack. Even though I think plain ole tomatoes would have been perfect hubby doesn't like them so I just added a couple tablespoons of salsa to each burger instead. I think the key to this recipe is to use your absolute favorite bbq sauce and not just any that are on special that week. My sauce of choice is Kansas City's own Gates. These were delish!",

I also used turkey meat instead of beef so I had to put some bread crumbs in it to keep the pattys from falling apart. Also I only used 1/4 cup of bbq sauce. Last change I made was I minced the cilantro and mixed with the meat instead of just garnishing the top of the cheese. Turned out great!!!",
