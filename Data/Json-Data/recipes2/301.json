They are either mushy or burnt. I will say that I did bake these in a 13x9 glass baking dish instead of a cookie sheet and got a better result than in the past. I followed the instructions to a T and had to bake them for about 45 minutes. Near the end of baking time, I increased the temp to 475 for a few minutes to crisp them up. I will use this recipe again until I get it right!",
