This recipe is my own take and I call it my favorite over every Reuben I have had. For me, a Reuben must be made from a cooked-at-home corned beef brisket or real New York-style pastrami. If either of these staples is not available, I will not consider making a Reuben. When it's time to slice the corned beef I don't let myself be sissified. I cut nice slices about 1/4-inch thick. I leave the fat on.",

I have to tell you that this is a wonderful condiment for any sandwich! I didn't even let it sit for the recommended three hours! This will be good with just about anything that you'd use mayonnaise for! You can play around with the amounts of the ingredients--I'm thinking in particular of the horseradish (love that stuff)! I will be buying the dill pickle relish so I'll be ready for when I cook up a corned beef that sits in my freezer right now. My hubby thinks I'm a star for serving this for our lunch today!

The actual sauce recipe is delicious but.....when you read the Cook's Note at the bottom and follow those instructions on how to use the sauce to make a Reuben the sandwich is OUT OF THIS WORLD - AWESOME!! The hard boiled eggs really add a nice richness to the dressing. Our sandwiches were so filling that I only served fresh sliced tomatoes and fresh peaches/blueberries with them. I don't think I will ever make another Reuben without this recipe. Thanks for taking the time to submit this recipe Mike. A winner in this house!!:o)",
