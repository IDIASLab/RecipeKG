They boys particulary liked it with barbeque sauce and honey mustard. Hubby and I ate it as it. Go easy on the cumin however as it can be overpowering very quickly. My only complaint is that the recipe didn't even come close to feeding 4. This was more like a serving for two. I doubled it and the four of us ate every bite along with brown rice risotto and oven roasted vegetables. Great veggiew entree!!",

I was running low on soy sauce so I used Bragg's instead and I only had about 1T of nutritional yeast so I just used all-purpose flour to make up the remainder of the 1/3C. I sliced the seitan into strips about 3/4\" thick. The breading stayed on without any problems -- you have to get the oil hot enough is what I've found. My seitan was a little spongy so I was worried they would stay spongy but nope they fried up nice and crispy! I will definitely be making these again.",

Instead of the tamari I dipped the seitans in a mixture of Bragg's liquid aminos (practically the same thing flavor-wise) and beaten egg to make the mixture stick better. The finished product tasted like school cafeteria chicken fried steak (in a good way) so next time I'm going to make a gravy and mashed potatoes to go with it. This is definitely the best breaded seitans recipe I've tried. I have since tried serving these with gravy and mashed potatoes and they are really good. To make a good chicken-fried-steak-style gravy for them reserve the oil after cooking the seitans and just whisk in and cook 1/4 c. flour add vegetable broth until the flour is wet enough to completely dissolve and then add 4 cups milk. Bring the gravy to a simmer and cook for about 7 minutes until thickened. Season with kosher salt and pepper.",
