I really was surprised how well it turned out. Very simple to make and it was pretty tasty. I melted the marshmallows and chocolate together to prevent lumps. Then based a another review I used the mousse to fill cream puffs for Valentine's Day. Boy was my husband happy he loves chocolate and mint. While it was not the best mousse I have ever had but it was the easiest and was good tasting.",
