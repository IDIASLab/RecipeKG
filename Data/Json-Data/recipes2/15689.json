I didn't have chicken broth so I added 2 boneless skinless chicken breast halves to the recipe chopped into very small pieces (pinto-bean size). I sauteed the onion & bell peppers along with 3 minced garlic cloves over medium-high heat in 2 tablespoons oil and added the raw chicken when the veggies were tender. When the chicken was done I added 2 1/2 cups water 2 tablespoons lemon juice and ONE 15-oz. can of each of the following: diced tomatoes refried beans (as one reader suggested) navy beans (drained) pinto beans (drained) and light red kidney beans (drained). I brought the whole mixture to a boil then turned the heat down to low covered and simmered for 30 minutes. We wouldn't have liked it without the chicken but now it's one of our favorite soups!",

You can do it hot or mild adding cummin garlic chili powder jalapeno or other green yellow or red pepper along with the bell peppers and a handfull of frozen corn. It really looks nice and colorful and tastes like a fajita in a bowl. If you want to make it richer add a can of cream of chicken soup to the stock. You can also cut down on the sodium if you cook the dry beans instead of adding canned. You can top it with sour cream and/or shredded cheese and scoop it using corn chips as a spoon.",
