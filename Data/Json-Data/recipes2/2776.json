My husband gets bored easily though, so I gave this a try. I wasn't expecting it to be great, but it was. I reduced the servings to two, because I didn't want to use up all my leftovers. I used my homemade stuffing, green beans we had instead of mixed veggies, and we don't care for mayo so I swapped it for leftover gravy so the dish would have moisture and it worked like a charm. This was so simple to throw together and it tasted wonderful. I will keep this recipe handy to use throughout the year for quick meals when I have leftover chicken to use up.",

I started with Stovetop Cornbread stuffing, prepared as directed then added saut\u00e9ed celery, onions and grated carrot and pressed it into the baking pan as a crust.  I added a layer of chopped Portabella mushrooms which I saut\u00e9ed with onions and mixed with Italian cheese blend.  The top was mashed potatoes, piped into rosettes.  This was the first time I felt we presented a vegetarian meal equal to the regular meal.  The second time I made it as per the recipe, but using leftover stuffing and a frozen vegetable mix with leftover turkey.  The mayo made it moist and enhanced the flavors.  The topping was a bit scant because there was only a small amount of left over mashed potatoes.  I served it with homemade cranberry relish and no one whined about leftovers.",

Sure, I like all of the Thanksgiving food ingredients.  But the mixed vegetables, added with the mayo...I was skeptical.  But I have to say this casserole is absolutely fabulous!  The end result is very pot pie-ish, and that's always a winner with my family.  It's the ultimate comfort food, and this puts a wonderful Thanksgiving spin on it!",

If making this with leftovers it took considerably more turkey and potatoes than I had expected. I used about 8 good sized medium potatoes and the turkey was about 2/3 of the white meat on a turkey. I liked the potato and stuffing layer. I boiled the potatoes in water flavored with no-sodium chicken broth powder for extra flavor. The stuffing I tweaked to a homemade stuffing with sauteed onions dried sage and some extra bread and a little liquid added to Stove Top's cornbread stuffing. I didn't love the middle layer. I added some seasonings but it kind of reminded me of turkey salad. I used regular mayo as I find miracle whip more of a sweet salad dressing. However all together it worked fine. As this doesn't have any sauce to it definitely serve with your favorite Thanksgiving additions. Think I will be making some homemade cranberry sauce to go on the side. It's a must for me with a Thanksgiving meal.",
