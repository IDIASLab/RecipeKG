I had a yellow cake mix and I added 1 tsp. orange extract and 1/4 c. orange juice and zested half of a large orange in to the cake mix.  Worked perfectly.  In my picture, the cookies on the left we baked after just dropping them on the cookie sheet.  The cookies on the right (my preferred way) were how they baked up if I smashed them just a little prior to baking.  Nice cookie that you could taste both the orange and the cranberries.  I would make these again.",
