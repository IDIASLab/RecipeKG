First,  he used beautiful, large, meaty shrimp - 13-15 count.  These big guys required more than just a third of a slice of bacon, so Hubs didn't cut the bacon until after he partially cooked it in the microwave and saw how long he needed the pieces to be.  As for the spices, he cut waaaaaaay back on the pepper and that was definitely to our liking.  Finally, he didn't want the muss and fuss of frying them, so he opted to broil them instead.  When we make these again, however, we'll make it easy on ourselves and just use a good Cajun seasoning rather than mix all the herbs and spices individually. This would be a fine and proud addition to your holiday appetizer table.",
