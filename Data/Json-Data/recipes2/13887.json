If desired, serve with mixed greens tossed with pecans, a fruit vinaigrette and crumbled blue cheese. Add herbed egg noodles and a crusty bread, and you've got a meal made in heaven!",

In the sauce I cut it down to a lil under 1 cup of wine and there was no strong wine taste I used white zinfendel (sp?) that is actually pink. I added quite a bit extra garlic powder enough until I could smell it in the sauce. Instead of mustard seed I added about a tablespoon of dijon mustard. I let the chicken sit overnight with the cheese and sauce on it. Right before baking I added the croutons and melted butter. I did not measure it just added what I thought I'd want. I baked pepperidge farm puff pastry shells halfed them and placed the chicken and sauce over it. Really good!",
