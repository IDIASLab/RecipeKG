I don't use a double boiler -- just melt the cheese in a sauce pan VERY slowly on low and stir occasionally. I add a small amount of cream cheese along with the pepperjack and since we love the taste of cumin I add that at the end. Also I use 2 percent milk instead of half and half (less amount). I have never had trouble mixing the cheese and milk (as others have stated). The only problem I ever had was when I made it a day ahead refrigerated it then micro-waved it -- the milk separated from the cheese and was a big lump.",
