I'd make this again but I would cut back on the buttermilk and lime juice and increase the mayonnaise. That aside the flavor was dynamite.",

I used 3/4 cup buttermilk MILD chopped green chiles 3/4 cup mayo 1/2 of a large jalape\u00f1o (plenty spicy for our palate) and 1/2 of juiced lime. All other ingredients per recipe. The texture was fine for me as a dip however if one would like it a little more thick using full fat mayo may help that. Excellent flavor and will definitely make again. Surprised more have not tried this dip. Definitely missing out on a very different delicious dip.",
