I put the bacon in the oven (must be cold!), brush my teeth, start cooking other breakfast items, and then take the bacon out after 14 minutes - that's it! My bacon theory is that by placing the bacon in a cold oven to start, as the oven gradually heats to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C), the bacon undergoes a magical transformation from cold flabby piece of meat, to simmering deliciousness, to crispy bacon heaven as the oven hits the 425 degree mark. Enjoy!",

They also use the cold oven method but set the oven to 400\u00ba, rotating foil-lined pan halfway through cooking, cook time 10 to 15 minutes, depending on size of bacon slices and size of baking sheet.  I have found using the convection setting my bacon is crispy in about 10 minutes.  Another tip, if putting a little water on the slices before baking, they lay perfectly flat, no curling.",

I used center cut regular bacon, and it took about 16-17 minutes.  What was interesting to me is that the bacon didn't shrink up much, and turned out perfectly cooked with no mess in the oven.  I left the bacon grease solidify a bit, rolled up the foil, and just pitched it in the trash.  Once you get your timing down, this is a great way to cook bacon.",

                "reviewBody": "First I would like to clarify a misconception about Canadians and bacon: people think we eat \"Canadian Bacon\", which is actually either \"back bacon\" or glorified ham. Sure we eat that...occasionally, like anybody else, BUT we DO know what bacon is, and that is what we eat when we refer to bacon - the long glorious strips of salty, greasy fried bacon just like you Americans. And we LOVE it! I don't know why back bacon has become known as \"Canadian Bacon\", because it's just not the bacon we cook most and love!\r\nNow I would like to make 3 comments on my experience with this recipe:\r\n1. Super easy, but depending on thickness of bacon, adjust time. My oven also has \"hot spots\" so i need to rotate the cookie sheets.\r\n2. CAREFUL when taking out/moving cookie sheets, there may be a lot of grease. Once the grease spilled out and burst into flames in the bottom of the oven...made a huge mess that was hard to clean!\r\n3. My oven takes WAY longer than the 14ish minutes it's supposed to take to heat up...just watch bacon, depending on thickness. Take out when a little under-done or 'just' done, don't over do it unless you like very crispy bacon.\r\nCheers from your neighbors to the North!",
