I liked it, but my kids wouldn't touch it (not sure why, they had no idea it was cauliflower!) and my husband said it was just ok.  The flavor and texture are light, although not quite mac & cheese-like.  I don't think it was the recipe writer's intention to \"hide\" the vegetables, and if that is what you are looking for, I don't think this recipe will help you do that.  The flavor and texture of the sauce is not close enough.  However, if you like cauliflower and are looking for a lighter and healthier version of the classic recipe, this is a good one to try!",
