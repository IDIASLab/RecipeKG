I then beat the cream cheese added in the pineapple with a little juice then added in the pudding mixture-once mixed I folded in the cool whip and this helped to keep it light and fluffy. I refrigerated it overnight and frosted my pineapple mud cake from this site in the morning before I left for work. Everyone loved it. This topping made the whole thing so creamy but not overpowering in sweetness. Loved It!",
