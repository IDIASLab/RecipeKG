I did take a short cut in that I always keep homemade basil in the freezer (I put it in zip-loc bags sort of flatten it out then break off chunks as I need it). Since there was only Hubs and me eating it I opted to use fresh Italian rolls from a wonderful old Italian bakery in Milwaukee. I agree with the submitter to slice the tomato thinly although this is just a matter of personal preference. Not only is this delicious with the slightly crunchy toasted Italian bread with its classic \"Caprese-style\" flavors of basil tomato and mozzarella but it also makes your mouth water just from its eye appeal. For me this is some darn good comfort food.",
