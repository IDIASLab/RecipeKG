If you don't add the french fried onions and add onion soup mix instead and if you dump a bunch of other marinades in the mix then you are not rating THIS recipe you are rating YOUR OWN! Why not try it as stated THEN rate it or just don't rate it at all. That being said I made this recipe AS STATED and found that it did indeed need garlic salt pepper. Grilled pineapple sounds nice too. But that is a total different recipe!!! I rated it a 3 because it's a good base recipe.",

Also my local market has a teriyaki/wasabi mainade it is made by ESSENSIA and carried by Albertsons. It adds a nice kick above the standard teriyaki. Durring BBq'ing I glazed the patties with the extra teriyaki/wasabi and opted for sharp cheaddar cheese these modifications with the bolder flavors took this burger over the top. while the burgers were finishing up cooking I grilled up some pineapple rings I had basted in hot vietnameese fry sauce but you can just as easily baste them in a vegtable oil/grill spice blend it really adds a beautiful sweet/spicy topper for the finnished burgers!",

Also I used dried onion soup mix I had on hand instead of the french fried onions-but only about a third of the packet for fear it would be too salty. Also I fried them in a skillet instead of griling. Talk about juicy!! Tasty easy and delicious!!!",

I mixed that and the crumbled french fried onions into the ground chuck and let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours. My husband cooked them on a charcoal grill and I have to say they were absolutely deliciou! Very juicy with an incredible flavor! Instead of cheddar we used Provolone. I thought a little horseradish sauce would taste good but was out of that too so mixed some horseradish with mayonnaise and these were by far the BEST burgers I have ever had! Hubby ate it with no condiments and and raved! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!",

I doubled the recipe and i used 6 oz. can of the onions and maybe I shouldnt have used all of that can - I think that is what made the meat mushy. The consistancy was like a mushy meatloaf. The flavor was ok it still needed something though - something with a punch. On the other hand my husband liked them and said they were the most flavorful hamburger that we have ever made. So we had 2 totally different opinions. I am thinking grilled pineapple with this burger would be good.",
