I used fresh garlic (3 small cloves) crushed. I cooked the onion and garlic in the grease for about 3 minutes before adding the potatoes. I added Tony's creole seasoning. I cooked for about 15 minutes more then drained off all the excess grease. Then I cooked for 10 more minutes until about half of the potatoes were browned. Excellent. I would recommend using a very good sized deep frying pan. If I had used a bigger (diameter) pan more of the potatoes would have browned.",

I found I had far too much grease after cooking the bacon and poured some off before adding the potatoes and my onions burnt after 20 minutes in the pan. I'm giving this a three because I'll definitely try it again - adding the onions 10 minutes into the cooking time adding some salt and fresh pepper and more potatoes/less bacon grease. A good place to start.",

Also there was no way the onion could fry for 20 mins without getting totally burned so I threw it in about 6 mins til the end of the cooking time. Finally have plenty of kitchen paper ready to absorb all the bacon grease. I'll probably try this again but with cubed potato. Thanks.",
