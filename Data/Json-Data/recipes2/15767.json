Then I beat 4 oz of cream cheese with 1/2 cup powdered sugar. Then I folded the cream cheese mixture and whipped cream together. To that I added some well drained finely chopped peaches. I assembled the cake and then frosted the top and sides with the whipped cream cream cheese frosting recipe from this site and added some yellow and red food coloring to give it a peach tint. I added some peaches to the top of the cake after I had chilled the cake for quite some time right before serving so they wouldn't slide off! Thanks for the recipe though you gave me some great ideas!",
