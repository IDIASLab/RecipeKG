I love that look:) I also am in love with the sweet saltiness from the peanut butter Ritz Crumble Topping and I am infatuated with the mixture of the peanut butter and caramel sauce. I could eat that stuff by the spoonful. Just a tip - make sure the hot fudge sauce is cold when it is spread on the cracker. Even though you may think the heat will melt it and make it sink into the cracker it does not. It remains as a nice neat little layer in the cheesecake. I hope you will enjoy!",
