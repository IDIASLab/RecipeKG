Chicken with gravy, but with a twist:  spicy heat for a Southwestern kick; Grana cheese for an Italian twist; almonds and avocados for contrasting textures and flavors.  \n\nIt really worked.  One person called it \"housewifey.\"  Overall, a unique, creative blend of flavors you might not think would go well together, but they did.  \n\nWhen I make this again, I will probably go the \"healthy\" route.  i.e. replace the cream with starchy \"thickeners\" that may be handy, and sautee with olive or soy oil rather than butter.  To save time, you don't need to sautee chicken until done - you can brown quickly and then let the chicken finish cooking in the assembled dish when it is in the oven.  Also, nothing beats home made chicken broth for extra flavor (defatted, low-sodium).",

It didn't seem like a \"casserole\" to me really - we served it with pasta to utilize the sauce. The sauce was decent, but kind of ho-hum.  The nuts in the dish didn't really add much other than calories.  The avocados - I like them, but they seemed to get lost in the other flavors.  I found this to be just very average and I won't make it again.",

Butter substitute...again we are heathly eaters here. Sliced the chicken so its smaller fillets. I used 3 mushroom mix pre cut in the produce section gives great flavor rather than just using plan button mushrooms. Served with a little Motz. cheese on the side (boyfriend loves cheese. I cut the avacado into chunks and put it on top of the chicken with the mushrooms and put the sauce on top. Also served with fresh roasted red pepper brown rice. I would totally serve this again!

My husband isn't hard to please, but is very hard to get a 5 star rating from.  He said that this was 5 stars EASILY.  I used less chicken & made more gravy.  Also, lightly salt, peppered & garliced prior to browning - then used less salt in gravy.  Tossed in a couple of dashes of red pepper, as well.\nThis one is definitely going into our rotation, but I think that when the family is over, I'm going to make it more \"casserole-y\".  I think I'll cube the chicken, then brown & follow the rest of the recipe like normal. The chunks of chicken in the delicious sauce can be served over a bed of brown rice.",
