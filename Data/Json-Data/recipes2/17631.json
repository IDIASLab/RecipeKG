I grew up in RI (1957) and have had red chowder just like this all of my life. I had done some research and the red tomato-based chowder is traced to RI's Portuguese immigrants who came with tomato-based soups. New Englanders called it \"Manhattan\" chowder as a derisive term because it was not clear or white. But RI red chowder was always a fixture at George's in Galilee and at Iggy's and I wouldn't eat a clam cake without some!",

Forgive me for not knowing that RI's chowder is clear, as I have never had it.  I just assumed that the red was yours because every eatery, from the City to all along the coast, offers either red or white.  This recipe is a quick and easy fix for the red.  The tomato soup and sauce in the recipe is not the major player. It's the 46-oz can of clam juice, which is not always easy to find.  Add just enough tomato sauce for color.  Thanks JimD for your review.  I have the same memories of the Shore Dinner Hall.",
