I inspired a few changes since I didn't have everything on hand and made it on a smaller scale. I used a small can of white crab meat mixed it with 1 tablespoon mayo 2 tablespoons butter 1 cup of shredded 'cheddar jack' cheese a little parmesan cheese and mashed it together into a spread. I put a nice thick layer over a bagel half and sprinkled with the paprika. I broiled them in a toaster oven for about ten minutes until they started bubbling. They were delicious!!! Looking at my quantity you could make 4-6 bagel halves which is quite a lot of snack for a decent sized family. I'll definately make this again the crab flavor was NOT lost in the ingredients. Yummy!!! I've also submitted a picture.",

( I add a little garlic and use the canned crab as well)",
