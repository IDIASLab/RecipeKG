When i used the cheap brands of regular long grain rice the rice takes more than an hour to cook. An additional half hour even. The converted rice is cooked through after 60 minutes. Definitely better to spend the extra money than to run around the kitchen like a chicken with her head cut off because the guests are hungry and the rice isn't done. This is on the table every year for Christmas.",

Sometimes I cook chicken in with the rice - I just throw it in with the rest of the ingredients before popping it into the oven and it's always cooked through and juicy when the rice is done.",

I also added some shredded carrots & some fresh chopped parsley (about 1/8 c.).  I will make this again, but I will probably only use the can of french onion and a 14 oz can of low sodium beef broth to cut a little on the salt.  Good recipe Karen, thank you ;)",

Used Uncle Ben's converted rice and was done in exactly an hour as promised. This recipe will go into my regular rotation, thanks!

I left out the butter and baked it uncovered for 90 minutes stirring about half way through. Couldn't ask for an easier recipe than this and pretty tasty too. It had a funny aftertaste though; I think I'll try it with 2 cans of low sodium beef broth and a couple teaspoons beef bouillon next time with a dash of either Soy Sauce or Worchestershire. I think it would taste better if you used fresh mushrooms saut\u00e9ed in a little olive oil as well and toppled with some thinly sliced green onions or fresh parsley. I am on a quest to find a tasty simple to prepare rice side dish to replace the processed boxed varieties that are full of chemicals and preservatives!",
