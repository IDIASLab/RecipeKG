I had frozen strawberries cherries and pineapple all organic non GMO fruits so I thought it would be nice and sweet but I had to add honey to sweeten it up. If I make it again I will definitely leave out the pineapple which overpowered the flavor of all of the other fruits. I did love the consistency-not too thick and not too thin. All in all nutritious but not delicious.",

                "reviewBody": "Made this exactly as the recipe stated with the exception of having to use Maraschino cherries (1/4 c minus the juice) because I did not have any pitted cherries. I don't think it altered the taste significantly. The recipe did not say whether or not to add the pineapple juice so I did not. Don't know how this altered the taste or consistency. Loved the texture and color but the taste was bland. While the original version was still in the blender I added one whole banana and two Tablespoons of artificial sweetener. The whole banana was a bit much and over powered the other fruits. Next time I will only use 1/2 of a banana. There was still something missing. I liked it better with my additions. I think I will keep this recipe and make it again altering ingredients as I go for a while to see if I can get a bit more flavor in it. With my additions I would rate it pretty good but since I am rating the recipe as original listed I will have to say it was ok. But this recipe definitely has potential. Thanks for sharing it.",

This one does not AND it tastes good! We like our smoothie texture a bit on the thick side and since this does not call for any frozen fruit I did cut back on the milk (used skim) and added crushed ice. I had fresh pineapple on hand so I used that and next time I'll add a banana (WTH it is a fruit salad smoothie!). Thanks Adri7077 for a new breakfast smoothie!",
