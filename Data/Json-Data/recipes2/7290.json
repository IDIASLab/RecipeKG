Still a family favorite!\n\nThis is delicious and so versatile!\nI used a whole bag of thawed, skinless chicken breasts, instead of whole chicken, since I don't like messing with the skin and bones.  Cooked for about 3-1/2 hrs on high in the slow-cooker.  I used mild picante but easy to spice up with a hotter variety.\n\nWonderful served with rice, plain, Spanish or Mexican.  This makes lots of juice to spoon over the rice.\n\nWith just two of us at home, there was enough for lunches, and still have plenty left to shred for Easy Chicken Fajita Soup, adding the excess juice as a base for the soup broth!  \n\nMy head is spinning from all of the possibilities for this!  It will become a staple to use in my freezer make-ahead meals.",
