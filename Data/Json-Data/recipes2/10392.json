The sweet strawberry mixed in with the buttery creamy avocado, the crunchy onions, zing from bits of fresh jalape\u00f1o, and the lime juice mends it all together...I just have to say, WOW...Who'd have ever thought. What a wonderful way to get your vitamins...and to all the 92 that saved this but haven't tried it...give it a try...you might like it. :P",
