I do have to confess I didn't use cilantro because I'm not a fan (I know I'm Hispanic and don't like cilantro - go figure) but I KNOW this dressing would be superb with it for those who are fans. Aside from the missing cilantro I kept to the rest of the vinaigrette by using a fresh squeezed orange and two cloves of garlic. Note: don't be crabby to find dressing at the bottom of your salad; even with little oil the flavor manages to cling to every bite! A lot of flavor. This is a refreshing change from the usual dressings. Thanks!",
