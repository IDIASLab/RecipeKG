My other son and I would probably give it 3 stars mainly because we felt the cilantro really overpowered the entire salad. I really liked the tofu cooked this way and would probably double that the next time around. Also I'd add the peanuts at the last minute so that they would still be crunchy. If you love the flavor of cilantro you would definitely love this salad!",

I found a tip somewhere (I think from the Year of Crockpotting website actually) that recommends coating tofu in cornstarch then frying and it makes it crispier. I'll try that next time. I really love sweet and spicy chile sauce and it shines in this dish. I made one serving bc I only had one brick of tofu left (and bf won't eat it anyway) and made the tofu last night. I mixed everything together today for my lunch and I love it. I halved the dressing amounts and ended up adding a bit more chile sauce and lime juice in but not the full amounts. I used dried cilantro (I don't do well with fresh herbs in the fridge and don't have an herb garden) so I used about 1/3 less than what the fresh would be. Thanks for the recipe!",
