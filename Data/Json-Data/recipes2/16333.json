I used a whole 10 oz bag of white chocolate chips, and melted about 6 oz to mix into the cream cheese & whipped topping mixture.  I also used a whole 8 oz package of cream cheese instead of the 3oz called for and sprinkled in a little more confectioners sugar.  I sliced the berries, & drizzled the remaining 4oz of melted white chocolate on top.  The more strawberries you can fit in your pie, the better it turns out!  A word to the wise though!  Make sure you use the freshest berries you can, and try to eat the pie in as timely as a fashion as you are able to.  Otherwise, you will have a runny strawberry juicy mess!",

Wash and dry strawberries then dip stawberries into melted milk chocolate or dark chocolate and stick into bottom of pie instead of drizzling chocolate over berries. My method was chocolate covered strawberries sticking out from the pie surface.",
