Added my own special seasonings as if I were going to eat them that way.  I cannot imagine boiling the fish with absolutely no seasonings-- it would have tasted bland for my taste. I used only half of a medium sized onion.  I flaked most of the fish instead of mashing.  I used 2 tbsp. of Hellmann's mayo which is my preference and lastly I used 1 1/2 cups of Keeblers crackers. This recipe is a keeper-- Absolutely delicious!!! The taste truly isn't that different from crab cakes.",

I used seasoned bread crumbs (as I didn't have cracker crumbs on hand)and used only 1/4 cup of oil (you don't need to drown these - just a little oil will make these browned & crispy). Next time I wouldn't mash the fish so much - I'd leave it kind of chunky, and maybe use slightly more fish (or less bread/cracker crumbs). I was surprised that my husband really liked these - and he even suggested that I should make some \"mini\" catfish cakes as an appetizer for our next party. You could certainly use tilapia, or any other white flaky fish for these (my mother has even made a similar version with canned tuna!)",

I serve them with a big salad and it is a delicious dinner.
