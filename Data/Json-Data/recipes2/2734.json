The chicken broth and lemon give it a lighter and brighter taste that is a welcome change to heavy white sauce.

As it is, it is a little on the bland side- perhaps some sun dried tomatoes or marinated peas mixed in to give it a punch of flavor. I would also think sausage would do well with instead of chicken. A fun dish to play around with!",
