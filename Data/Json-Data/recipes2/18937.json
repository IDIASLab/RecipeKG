Just over a cup of Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce Wishbone's Chunky Blue Cheese dressing and Neufchatel Cream Cheese - didn't use any other cheese. I do believe this will be alternated with my Chili Cheese dip (My staple)... Wow! TRY THIS!!! (Kept it in the crock to keep it warm and served with Scoops and Celery stix)",

I use Bleu Cheese (personal preference) and reduced fat cream cheese and fresh cooked chicken (makes a world of difference on the taste.

I have one suggestion though after baking transfer it to a crock pot to keep warm; I learned this lesson after I made the first time and it cooled off so quick. I had to keep reheating in microwave and it doesnt taste good cold! Great with celery fritos scoops chicken in a biscuit crackers or tortilla chips.",

I made no changes but I did use a rotisserie chicken and my KitchenAid mixer and that made this dip super easy. I used all the white meat on the chicken and that was enough for the dip right at two cups chopped. I don't think it would hurt to put a little more cheese in the dip. Next time I might use a little less Frank's. Even though my hubby loves wings he likes them mild. I served the dip with Frito's and Tostitos Scoops. I personally like the Frito's best. I will make this again and again.",
