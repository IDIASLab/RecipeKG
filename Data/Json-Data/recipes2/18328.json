I also am not sure what creamy garlic salad dressing is so I used garlic ranch to coat the chicken.  I also used chicken tenders and baked at 350 for about 20 minutes.  Substituted original Craisins for the cranberries.  Served with a balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  My husband is not a fan of blue cheese and complained when I added, but he rated the recipe a 5 and even admitted to me the mandarin oranges, craisins & blue cheese compliment each other along with the balsamic vinaigrette.  (Served with TGIFs salad.)  Next time I will chill the chicken in the fridge for about a half hour after I have the dressing and nuts on the chicken and then bake.  It will hold the nuts better.  Thanks",

My husband loved it and he can't stand bleu cheese. -Next time I'm going to put the chopped lettuce in a colander and drain the juice from the oranges over it. I just think it will give the lettuce an extra kick. Thanks for the recipe!",
