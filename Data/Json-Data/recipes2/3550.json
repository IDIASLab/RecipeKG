This took less than 10 minutes to get into the oven, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  I used Pepperidge Farm herbed seasoned stuffing mix, and when I opened the oven door, it smelled like Thanksgiving.  I can see adding a little bit of sage to the soup-wine mixture in the future.  Please don't skip the wine, as it really does add flavor to the sauce.  I may try reconstituting the dried cranberries a little in hot water because they did dry out pretty well during the baking process.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's going into my favorites folder.",

Leftovers the next day were great too! We're big eaters so we did need another side in addition to salad but we just made extra stuffing. Light eaters shouldn't need anything else but salad.

I didn't have white wine so I bravely added 1/4 cup of organic red wine. After that thickened I poured it over the chicken cutlets that were covered in the mozzarella cheese. I then followed the directions as written and baked at 325 on the convection roast setting. I am so hoping it turns out despite my brave alterations!",
