I added about a 1/2 cup of sugar to the dough and I used strawberry jam. I also brushed the tops of the pockets with an egg washed and sprinkled them with sugar before baking. It tastes really good!!! But I couldn't get the jam to stay inside the dough pockets. It would leak out no matter how well they were sealed. I ended up making little quarter-sized cookies topped with jam. I think this would be a great recipe for tartlets though and I will try that in the future.",

I follow the directions as is and w/no addition of sugar to the dough...and they are the BEST I have tasted to date. This cookie makes it to my Christmas Cookie Bake- Off every year without fail. I mail my homemade cookies to my sisters who are out of state; and this is one cookie they always request. The only suggestion I would add is that you really need to make sure the dough is totally chilled before you start to roll the dough in your hands otherwise the butter in the the dough just melts away in your hands. And that should do the trick! Once again I couldn't tell you what a delicious and tasty cookie this recipe makes. Wish I could give it 10 stars...Thank you J. Wagner!!!",

After reading the reviews the changes I made were butter instead of margarine and I added 1/2 cup of sugar - it would have been too bland otherwise. Also the turnover method although messy and not as pretty looking is better tasting but having a circular cookie and indent it to fill various jam flavors is a great and easier method apricot is still the best choice. This is a time consuming recipe though - at least while watching young kids at the same time.",
