I also used organic black beans I made ahead of time and keep in the freezer for quick meals and I used organic long grain rice instead of boxed. I picked from the last of my garden 3 Roma tomatoes garlic onion small yellow bell pepper and blended. I added cumin vegetable bouillon and a pinch of cayenne with 4 cups water and 2 cups rice then a bag of frozen corn. Boiled for 15 minutes. Very easy my family loved it. It was not too spicy if you use only a little cayenne.",

I just made a few changes based on what I had on hand. 1) I seasoned fish with adobo cumen and a light dusting of salt and then baked it in the oven at 425 for about 15 minutes. 2) I added fresh onion and yellow pepper which I just sauted in a skillet to add to the rice mix. I would make this again in a heart beat!",
