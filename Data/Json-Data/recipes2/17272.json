The secret to making them taste great is all in the brand of cocktail sauce and crab meat you use.  I have made them with generic cocktail sauce and crab meat and was not to trilled with the taste.  Use KRAFT cocktail sauce, it's the best.  Like I say some imitation crab meat tastes better than others, you just have to find a good brand that doesn't taste too fishy and I have found plenty of them.  I have also substituted other kinds of cheese and they still taste great.  Enjoy!",
