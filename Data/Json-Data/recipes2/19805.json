This recipe is perfect over noodles (macaroni was our first choice) with a little cheese and sour cream. YUMMY. The only thing that we didn't like about this chili is the level of spiciness. Chili should be spicy but this chili had a bit too much cinnamin flavor and not enough ummph. We will definitely make this chili again but next time we'll be adding a bit more spice to it.",

To try to add a little more actual tomatoes I added a can of diced tomatoes. Also the cinnamon was way too powerful for my family- they didn't even notice the \"hot\" spice just the cinnamon! I liked it but the family did not so it won't be on our menu again.",
