We used imatation crab since that is tastier to us and I buy on sale and freeze. (I just recommend squeezing the water out after thawing for this pizza) I made 1/2 the receipe and that would be great for 4 people with a side. I think the cream cheese is the right amount since there is not other cheese on it. (and i would not recommned adding other cheese since that would change the pizza too much and with the ingrediants not blend right) I would use the amount listed for the cream cheese and be sure to cut into little pieces so each bite is sure to have some cheese.",
