I assembled everything else only to discover I didn't have any stuffing! So instead of the stuffing I tore up some leftover rolls & put them on top. I melted some butter added turkey rub seasoning to the butter then brushed it on top of the bread. During the last few minutes of baking I added some french fried onions (to add some extra flavor since I didn't have the stuffing). I was hoping I'd get a little more solid of a \"crust\" with the potatoes but it was still soft (even though the top edges were getting brown). Nice way to use up the Thanksgiving leftovers & it had lots of flavor.",

I put the stuffing in the bottom for the crust and then did the potatoes on top (sort of like a Shepherd's Pie). Also all of our green beans always get eaten (I use the Green Beans and Cherry Tomatoes recipe here) so I usually throw in a bag of frozen mixed veggies. It's all a great combo!",

I used our leftover cornbread dressing for the crust and baked at 375 for 10 mins while I reheated the other sides. I added cubed turkey & ham some leftover wild rice/sausage/pecan dressing (personal recipe) & a few tbsp of gravy. Then I put my 'oranged' cranberry sauce on one half since I wasn't sure if hubby wanted it or not (he did!) then the mashed potatoes and melted butter. To save time I put the completed casserole in a pie plate in the microwave for 4 mins until it was hot then only baked for 15 mins until it was golden and bubbly. (the same principle of baking a potato; goes faster if you microwave it first.) This is a keeper! The kids 10 and 12 plus me & hubby only left about 2 big slices for leftovers and they're asking for more!",

We also added our cranberry sauce (as per another reviewer's suggestion) and mashed sweet potatoes. It was fantastic!!! We will definitely be making this again.
