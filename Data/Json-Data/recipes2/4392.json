I soak the cranberries in Brandy for a day or if you are in a hurry pop them in the microwave for 2 cycles of 30 secs and let them sit for 20 minutes. We love this recipe.",

The cake described as incredibly moist was so dry that it was inedible. I followed the recipe to the letter and since I could tell it was getting brown on the top very quickly I did not bake it the full one hour and 15 minutes but more like an hour. It was still inedible. My oven has just been calibrated so I know the oven was not the problem. Has anyone else had the same result with this recipe? I was really looking forward to tasting this very easy fruitcake and was extremely disappointed.",
