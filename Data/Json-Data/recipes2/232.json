I mixed 1 Tablespoon of olive oil along with the Cajun seasoning, garlic, thyme,  and parsley. To save time ,  I sprayed the inside of the air fryer with Pam and then  preheated the Air Fryer for 5 minutes at 350 degrees. I added the potatoes and baked for 9 minutes. I then tossed the potatoes and baked for another 7 minutes. Depending on the size of the potatoes you might have to cook a little longer. Meanwhile, melt 2 Tablespoons of butter. Place the potatoes in a bowl and toss with butter.",

I didn\u2019t bake the potatoes, simply cooked them whole in the microwave saving a lot of breakfast prep time. I\u2019d chopped some parsley but just forgot to garnish the potatoes.  We really enjoyed this recipe, that little bit of Cajun seasoning brings great flavor to home fries.  I did sprinkle on some paprika to give them a bit more color.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it\u2019s a good one.",
