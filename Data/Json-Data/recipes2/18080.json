I used the package of cream cheese as called for but only added the other ingredients to taste using somewhat less than called for and a small clove of minced garlic. I pulsed it in the food processor just long enough so that it was still \"whitish\" but with flecks of the tomatoes and basil. Beautiful. Delicious too. I served it with homemade crostini (cut small baguettes into 1/4\" slices brush each side lightly with olive oil. Season lightly with salt and pepper or garlic salt if desired and a dusting of freshly grated Parmesan. Bake at 375 until golden brown.)",
