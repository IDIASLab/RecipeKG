On Man vs food they grilled the sandwich so I did the same... glazed side inside the sandwich to save the glaze and make it a little neater. It was an interesting sandwich.. I liked the play between sweet and savory",

Velveeta is the most widely used processed stuff and sometimes mac 'n cheese just isn't the creamy delish stuff our taste buds crave crave without it as part of the recipe.
