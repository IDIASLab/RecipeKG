For my next try I would only add half the balsalmic vinegar as this was too bold of a flavor in the dish for me and I would also add another medium apple instead of just one as the apple went very well with the dish! Overall I would definitely make this again!",

Campbell's has reduced the salt in their soups to the point where they no longer cook up as well as they used to (say 10 years or so).  So, I found this a rather bland dish.  I might have considered adding some sour cream, and using rosemary instead of thyme.",
