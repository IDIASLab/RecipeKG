It was still salty and the ketchup did nothing for it. I had enough ingredients to make a modification based on suggestions of other reviewers. I washed 10 medium sized olives. I placed them in a blender with 8oz cream cheese and 6 TBSP of mild taco sauce. For the final touch I sprinkled the top with shredded cheddar cheese. This turned into a olive tasting southwestern dip. I'm glad I did a trial run before serving the original to my co-workers. I'm sure they would thank me!:)",

If you are unsure about your fondness for green olives this probably isn't a recipe for you. But I tell you what I got several requests for the recipe and my bowl was pretty much licked clean. Don't omit the ketchup...I know I was skeptical but it adds the right amount of secret flavor so it doesn't seem like you just bit into a brick of cream cheese with a mouth full of olives.
