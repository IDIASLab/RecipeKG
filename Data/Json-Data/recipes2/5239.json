I used a splash of olive oil and instead of seasoning salt I used a 1/4 teaspoon of paprika garlic powder onion powder and sea salt. I baked them at 425 for 30 minutes.",

I give it 4 stars because for me it was a little confusing the width of the potatoes and the timing. I sliced the potatoes really slime because if they had been 2 inches thick they wouldn't have cooked enough with the timing suggested by the recipe. Next time I think I'll cube the potatoes. I'm making this again because the flavor is really good.",

Definitely unique for white potatoes for me but good. In my neck of the woods hash browns are made with shredded potatoes. I chose not to shred because the recipe did not call for that but I did chop my potatoes into 1\" pieces instead of 2\". I substituted equal amounts of ghee grape seed oil and olive oil for the canola. I never buy canola oil. They turned out great and the cooking time was spot on for the size I cut the potatoes. I am tempted to try these with a sweet potato - I think it would be delicious!",
