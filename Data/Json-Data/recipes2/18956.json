Also added fresh mushrooms which had been sauteed with minced shallots then reduced with dark rum. Used chicken stock to make the couscous instead of water which added a lot of flavor. Added a handful of chopped fresh basil leaves and a sprinkle of Asiago along with the feta. Brought it to a potluck at my quilting bee today and it drew raves. Many stuffed pita bread with it and appreciated that it was a filling yet healthy sandwich. The recipe is a good starting point for a few tweaks that make this over-the-moon delicious. Even though I made quite a few additions A for a versatile out-of-the-ordinary recipe that can be altered easily to suit your taste.",

Mixed the oil and vinegar in a small bowl then dressed the couscous and vegetables with it. I then tossed it with some really good quality goat feta although only 4 oz.

I cut up two stalk celery with leaves. i made carrot slivers with my potato peeler. i opened a can of whole tomatoes put the juice in a ziploc in the freezer for another time and sliced up the tomatoes into cubes. I also cubed a whole cucumber. When the couscous was room temp I cut the asparagus into small pieces and added it and all the other vegies 1/4 cup fresh mozzarella 1 T mayo 2 t. italian dressing 3 sprigs fresh thyme and about 1/4 cup cucumber dill dip (sour cream based made for chips and vegies)mixed it all together and everyone in this household RAVED about it! even the asparagus haters ate it all.
