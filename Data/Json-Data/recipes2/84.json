It is neither Chinese, nor pie, so we don't know why it was called that - it's more like a shepherd's pie, but that's what it was called in our family. Believe it or not, this is great when you smush it all together and put ketchup on it! The kids love it!",

The Quebecois season their meat with Worcestershire sauce ketchup or similar flavors not with white sauce; and they make it with just corn like this recipe not with mixed veggies as I would do for shepherd's pie. The history behind the dish as we were told is that it was created to feed the thousands of Chinese workers brought in to build the Canadian National Railroad -- cheap available ingredients nutritious and filling.",

I added diced onions celery and carrots to the ground beef as well as black pepper onion powder garlic powder Worchestire Sauce and a pouch of salt free beef boullion Herbox. I used 1.5 lbs ground beef and added 4 cups of frozen corn. I did not do the cheese layer and only added the 1/2 cup to the mashed potatoes which my son really liked. My family likes it served with beef gravy or ketchup I like mine plain so the cheesy potatoes were a nice addition. I made this for the Allrecipes Allstars Canada April Challenge #ARFaceless",
