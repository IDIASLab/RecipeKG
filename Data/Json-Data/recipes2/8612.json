Then you are not rating the original recipe. In a way, you are rating your own recipe. What is the point of that?? There are many fabulous recipes on Allrecipes.com. This is one of them.\nThat being said, I made it as is. Candy of any kind, scares me. Candy thermometer, huh? Soft ball stage, What? I do NOT own a thermometer except for the human and pet kind. \nThis recipe is so easy. I like it very much because it doesn't require a candy thermometer. It's also very good. This would be a great kids first time cooking recipe. I just made it and it came out perfect. It is full of minty, sweet white chocolate goodness. I did not nor will not change a thing except to double it next time. Thank you for sharing and the great recipe.",

The ratio of peppermint extract was good. Didn't use the food coloring just a lot of peppermint candy. Great quick recipe!",
