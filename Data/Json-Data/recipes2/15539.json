First I used 10 med size potatoes and although I followed the recipe regarding the cheese/milk/soup mix I only poured about 3/4 over all...I could tell that there would be excess of sauce. Sure enough when I served I let it sit 10 minutes before serving hoping that the cheese would thicken but it was still very runny. Now I am a cheese lover...I mean cheese tops almost everything in our house esspecially potatoes but after this cheesy meal I have had my fill of cheese to last a week. IF I make again I will use more potatoes (or larger ones) use 1 can of soup half the milk half the processed cheese and less sour cream.",

The disadvantage is that since that means you also skip the step where the potatoes are cooked they end up not being quite as tender as they could be. Maybe there is a solution for that. But for busy working moms it still turned out very tasty and pretty quick!",
