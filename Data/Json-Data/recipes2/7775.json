I didn't notice this until I was putting it together and realized I needed more food requiring me to make so many changes. Also I wasn't sure what a 1Qt baking dish was so I improvised and not sure if that affected the outcome. Overall the taste is good; lasagne-ish. I will try to make this again with the right proportions by adjusting the servings before getting started.",
