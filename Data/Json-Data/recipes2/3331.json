It can be made fat-free or sugar free in any flavor available in a pudding mix. This recipe is ideal for busy cooks, children, elderly people, diabetics, or dieters who cannot find sugar-free ice cream they like, or anyone who wants to impress guests with little effort. This recipe has been tested in a Cuisinart&reg;&reg; 2-quart electric ice cream maker, the kind where you freeze the bowl overnight and do not need ice or salt. This ice cream tastes like very good commercial ice cream.",

It definitely has a pudding flavor (surprise!) and the texture at 5 degrees F is like granite, but let it sit out until it's about 12 degrees F and it's just right - creamy and silky. As it warms further, it becomes very pudding like. I'd have given it 4 stars, but I wanted to offset the unrealistic 1 star review. You're just making pudding with twice the half and half instead of milk, so if it had a bad flavor, I'd blame one of the ingredients, not the recipe.",

I only had 30 oz of half and half so I subbed 2 oz of heavy cream. Mixed it well before putting into my Cuisinart self chilling I've cream maker. 35 minutes later I have silky delicious keto icecream. Very very sweet can't tell it's sugar free and a small serving was very satisfying. Think about your ingredients use full fat liquid and you'll love it.",
