I had beans already cooked from something else so I added them to the potatoes with some of my roasted red peppers made some balsamic vinaigrette and put it all together for a sampling and forgot the cheese. I was going to sub cream cheese but totally left it out. Good flavor I don't like a lot of balsamic dressing too vinegary for me but the longer this sat (and cooled) the better it tasted. I think it might even be good as a cold salad. The potatoes need some salt in there somewhere unless it is picking it up from the goat cheese. Anyway sorry about the cheese and thanks Linda!",
