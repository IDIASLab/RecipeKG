I also did as other reviewer and halved the chicken breast but still pounded on them lightly to ensure tenderness. I tripled the amount of freshly diced garlic and added dry basil instead of fresh. Also added some garlic and a slight drizzle of salt. i also doubled the recipe and didn t strain the diced tomatoes because I only had 1 can of tomato sauce. Also added finely shredded Asiago cheese along with the Italian blend of cheeses. And topped off the recipe with the shredded Asiago for the final touch. I poured this on top of shell pasta and added a few Croutons. My family devoured it and even hubby complimented.",
