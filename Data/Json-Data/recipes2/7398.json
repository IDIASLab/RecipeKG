If you're making it the night before (highly recommended) then 4 to 5 gelatin sheets should do the trick. I placed the finished mixture into small coffee mugs to refrigerate. When it was time to serve them I warmed them up VERY briefly (otherwise if you warm them up for too long they'll turn back into their liquid state) flipped them onto a plate and sprinkled mint leaves berries and maple syrup on top. It was great! P.S if you're wondering what to do with the leftover buttermilk you could always substitute sour cream for buttermilk when baking. I did that with a banana bread recipe and it was the best I've ever had!",

As a huge Chef John fan I had to make this one instead. I usually have a 5 star experience with his recipes but sadly that did not happen with this one. I watched the video and he did say it was ok to swap out the dairy product so in an effort to cut calories I used half and half instead of heavy cream. Other than that I followed the directions. When I got to the straining part my concoction just sat in the strainer. About a tablespoon of clearish liquid dripped out so I just fished out the lemon peel and whisked the liquid back in then poured into Pyrex dishes. It started to separate immediately and got worse as it cooled. I still covered and put in the fridge overnight. My husband took one bite of the top creamy layer and spit it out. It was horrible. The consistency was gritty. I took a taste of both the top and the clear bottom layer and both were un-eatable. A couple of nights later I tried Clinton Kelly s recipe where the gelatin was sprinkled directly onto the cream and it also did not require straining. It was awesome. I did some research and seems using anything other than heavy cream can be tricky and more prone to separation. I don t know if I d try this again because if the half and half wouldn t strain I don t see how even heavier cream would strain?",
