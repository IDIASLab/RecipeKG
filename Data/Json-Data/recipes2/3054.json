Used regular low sodium Vigo brand rice (yellow saffron flavor) but any rice will really do. I gave a healthy shake of ancho chile and chipotle pepper powder to it. Again you can do this or not or add whatever you want or not - could be cayenne chili powder dash of turmeric (oops did that) cumin garlic onion powder. Point is it's a perfect builder or leave as is spice as needed or desired. Light cream cheese 2nd to last layer light cheddar and finally the spicy panko bread crumbs. These can also be tweaked. You know how it goes fattier is always gonna taste better but it can still be amazing tweaked down. But the panko bread crumbs shouldn't be left out. Regular crumbs will be a downgrade.",
