I used Fireball cinnamon whiskey in place of the schnapps, as that was all I had. Everything else I kept the same. This was so flavor intense and burned on the way down. But, it was oh, so good. I would only make this every once and a while because of the kick. I recommend everyone try this at least once. And make sure your ingredients are CHILLED!",

Everything is in equal parts so I measure it out into a quart container and keep it in the fridge.  Served over ice on a cold, snowy night, there is nothing much better.  A good drink for winter time.  I don't think that I would want it when it's hot out.  I'll have to try it with the cinnamon schnapps!  That would add a little fire to it.  Try it with the coffee liqueur--Excellent.",
