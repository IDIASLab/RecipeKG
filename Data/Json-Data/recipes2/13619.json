I used 2 bags of frozen green beans becuase I like the taste better than canned. Also I added 1 samll minced onion to the sour cream paste. I also added bacon to the green beans... and salt! I used fried onions to top it. Make sure that you get a good swiss cheese so that you can taste the flavor. It was a little soggy the next day but the flavor was even better!",

The \"paste\" mixture was very thick and the melted cheese made it even thicker. I tasted this mixture before adding the green beans and thought it was a little bland so I fried some bacon very crisp and crumbled this in with the green beans. This seemed to spice it up a little. Like I said the final dish was good although VERY different from your traditional green bean casserole.",

I don't melt the Swiss cheese into the green bean mixture but layer it on top. Spread this in a 9x13 pan. For the topping I only use 1 cup of cornflake crumbs with 1/2 cup butter.
