For starters I will say I made this recipe exactly as is with the exception of using 1 cup of regular cheddar 1 cup of reduced fat cheddar & topped with a sprinkling of cheddar instead of parmesan. I made the rest of the recipe as is. I believe the phrase \"You eat with your eyes first\" is accurate because if it doesn't look good - you won't want to eat it. That is the first problem I had with this recipe. You can't tell from the photo I posted but the pasta is brown and there were clumps of white cottage cheese that did not melt so it almost had a grey tint to the sauce. I like whole wheat pasta in pasta salad but I was not crazy about the taste or texture in this sauce. The sauce did not have a lot of flavor to us and needed some additional seasoning or additional cheese but that would have negated the \"healthier\" aspect. I wanted to like this recipe but I don't plan on making it again. I think I will save my macaroni and cheese as a periodic indulgence and stick with the real thing.",
