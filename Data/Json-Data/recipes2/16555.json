I only used 2 teaspoons of oregano, and I added 2 teaspoons of basil and 1/2 teaspoon of white sugar.  And with those tweaks, I made a Chicago-style stuffed pizza that was absolutely amazing!  You can go to my page to read my reviews of those other two recipes and what I did to make them.  I used the \"Jay's Signature Pizza Crust\" and \"Chicago-style stuffed pizza\" recipes (with minor tweaks to the latter) to make an amazing pizza!  Highly recommended!  Also, this sauce makes an amazing spaghetti sauce!!  And with the 2nd batch, for spaghetti only, I added about 1/2 teaspoon of fennel, which added another very yummy taste to the mix!  Next time, I'm going to mix in some ground beef for what I'm sure will be a stellar meat sauce!",

                "reviewBody": "About reducing the acid in this recipe, a digestive concern from an earlier reviewer:  Sugar was recommended by another reviewer, but it is actually acidic.  It cuts the acidic taste, but not the effect in your belly.  (The cheese on the pizza, and the white flour in the crust also push the digestive acid levels up.)  Instead (or in addition), add baking soda.  Really.  Remember those baking soda and vinegar \"volcanoes\" in Middle School?  That should remind you of what you need in order to neutralize the acid.  With all the strong flavors in this sauce, my guess is 1 tsp will go without notice.  Add more, if you want.  You could probably sneak some into a homemade crust, too.  If heartburn is a frequent problem for you, do a search on \"alkaline diet\" for more tips.",
