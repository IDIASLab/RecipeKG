After frying it in some Land O Lakes light buter, I removed the chicken from the pan while making the sauce. I doubled the amount of mushrooms and sauteed them with a bit of minced garlic. I used all Marsala wine for the sauce along with the chicken broth and added a little browning sauce along with a bit of cornstarch to thicken it. It turned out great! Perfect served with roasted potatoes and asparagus!",

I didn't use the oregano because I forgot to add it (oops) and I did use 1/2 grapeseed oil and 1/2 butter only because my butter seems to burn too quickly if I don't add a little oil with it. I also used all Marsala wine because I didn't have red on hand. I used about 1/2 - 3/4 cup Marsala because it needed a bit more flavor than the 1/4 cup (combined wines) gave it. Could be because I didn't use the red? Sherry is mentioned in the directions but not in the ingredient list so I didn't use it. Very tasty dish that I will be sure to make again.",
