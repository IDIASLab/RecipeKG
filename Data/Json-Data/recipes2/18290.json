It isn't the most inexpensive recipe around with the addition of crab meat and after having spent the extra money on the crab and then the souffle being inedible it was a major disappointment. I followed the recipe exactly as it is written. DH and DD love seafood but even they didn't care for this. The crab paired with the tuna was just way to fishy tasting. I used solid white albacore for the tuna so the fishy taste didn't come from the tuna. I also used a premium brand of crab meat so I think it was just having the two together made it just too overpowering. It tasted more like eggs with fish sauce all over them. I really wanted to like this recipe but we'll never make this again. Sorry.",
