The only thing I would do differently is after browning the ground beef (you could use ground turkey) would be to add a tablespoon of taco seasoning with about 1/4 cup of the water called for and cook that a bit while the Mexican Rice is cooking. Corn would be a great addition to this. If you don't want tacos this would be great rolled up in a flour tortilla.",
