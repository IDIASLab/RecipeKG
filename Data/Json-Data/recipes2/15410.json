There was something off putting about it though he said and my guess is that he found that the boxed cake mix taste shined through. He said that while it was good it was not stellar just average. His favorite part was the butterscotch chips/toasted chopped pecan topping and the caramel glaze I topped it with. (For the caramel glaze I melted some caramel ice cream topping with butter then added powdered sugar until desired consistency. A perfectly acceptable but only average cake. Following day update: First I forgot to mention that I substituted apple juice for the water called for in the recipe. Second hubs brought the cake to work this morning and it was gone just a few hours later. And a co-worker personally took the time to email me that the cake was....\"heaven.\" I guess I need to change my rating from 3 stars to 4!",
