Only had one red bell no mint and no Fresnos so instead of traipsing to the store for them I used a 12oz jar of roasted red peppers (less the juice) plus the red bell I roasted. Substituted 4 jalapenos and about a Tblsp Sriracha to get the heat up and used Basil rather than Mint. Not quite what you may have intended with my substitutions but WOW--Chef John my hat's off to you. A great balance between taste and heat. Thanks for your efforts as your recipes are always winners.
