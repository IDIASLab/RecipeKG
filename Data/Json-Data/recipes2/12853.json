Hindsight I could have spread the mixture out thinner to get more of a bark thickness instead of a rice crispie treat thickness but it was hard to judge based on how thick it was. Live and learn. Hubs said it tasted very similar to a Reese's. I don't eat sweets so he took this to work with him to share and it was all gone in less than 5 minutes. With only 3 ingredients you really can't go wrong with this.",
