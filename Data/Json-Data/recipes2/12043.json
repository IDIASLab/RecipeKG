The result was \"pumpkin sweetened honey with some butter pieces in it.\" Then I thought maybe it was supposed to be similar to apple butter or flavored honey? Either way I didn't know how to use the concoction so I attempted to fix it! In order to get a spreadable fluffy margarine or whipped butter like consistency the recipe would stay the same except the honey would have to be (1/4 cup or half) plus about 2 tsp extra approximately to get the desired sweetness. It will also have to be refridgerated in addition to harden. I am not sure how others did not have to adjust this and got a butter appearance & texture?",
