I didn't have the heart to flip the breast over halfway through because it would have soaked off all the wonderful herbs on the top of the turkey---I just added a little more to the sauce at that point.  I think the cooking time was off because I would not cook turkey to 180 degrees, but rather the new time of around 165.  This would  be a good way to fix a little more turkey at Thanksgiving time without doing a whole bird.  If you were going to serve this with mashed potatoes, you would perhaps want to have a little more of the gravy!  Thanks for a nice meal!",
