Didn't taste low-fat at all and even better than regular mac and cheese in a box made with tons of butter. It was indeed very creamy and VERY simple and cheap to make. Not only that but the servings were pretty big. I ended up using cream of mushroom because that was what I had on hand and it was pretty good. Next time I will try the cream of chicken or maybe even cream of brocolli. I do suggest adding the 1/4 cup of milk as it may be a bit gooey without it. This is the way I will be making boxed mac and cheese from now on.",
