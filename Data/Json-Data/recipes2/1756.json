Also the dough will look sticky and feel tacky it is supposed to be like that. Don't be tempted to add too much flour or you will end up with dry hockey pucks. I rolled the ball of dough into a circle brushed with butter and cut into wedges like a pizza. Roll each wedge from the outside edge to the center like a crescent roll. Knowing that 25 mins was too long to bake rolls I set the timer for 12 minutes and they were spot on.",
