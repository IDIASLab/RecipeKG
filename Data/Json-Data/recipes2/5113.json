I used white balsamic vinegar as I didn't want the brown to turn the yolks a funny color. I did omit the olives due to personal tastes. The filling is so wonderful in these that I think it would make a great egg salad spread to use with crackers bread or a wrap. I just used my small cookie scoop to fill the eggs. I had a little of the filling left over so I ate it on a couple of crackers. Shyla this is a great recipe that I will be using again! Thanks for sharing!",
