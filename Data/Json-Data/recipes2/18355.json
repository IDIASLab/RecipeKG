I like to put a sprig of herbs in mine (both rosemary & thyme are really good) I poke them w/ a sharp object (maybe they objected to my wording for \"poke w/ a sharp object\" LOL) a corncob skewer works good & that allows the tomatoes to absorb more of the vodka. I do drain mine though & save the vodka to use in bloody mary drinks. Don't soak these for longer than overnight or they get too strong & soggy. I pour a bed of kosher salt on a platter & use it as a bed for the tomatoes. This looks great & keeps them from rolling about. Be sure & label them if you take them to a mix w/ children. I once took them to a family function & my daughter told me how much my grandson liked them. Ooops!",

I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry and everyone wants the recipe. I lined a chip and dip tray with slices of lime and poured in the tomatoes. The stuck celery stalks in a various spots. After pouring the dipping sauce into the center holder it was ready. Definitely a hit even with people that don't normally like tomatoes.",
