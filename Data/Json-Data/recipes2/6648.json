Normally I love garlic and spicy but with just 8 basil leaves (I actually used 10 of the biggest I could find on my plants) this is really, really garlicky and the whole teaspoon of red pepper flakes makes it mighty spicy. To me this is more of a flavored oil than a spread. I made mine in the blender and it is thin. I toasted some sourdough bread, poured a bit of this on and topped with Parmesan. It's ok, but I won't be making it again.",

I tried again using milk as a base to make the spread creamier and it was but it was still pretty much what you would get just crumbling up garlic onto bread. The strong flavor of the garlic very much overpowers the basil and my tongue was burning (I probably spread it on too thick). I want to like this recipe but I think it needs something else to make it work.",
