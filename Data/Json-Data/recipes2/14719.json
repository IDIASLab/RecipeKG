The good - yes indeed the suggested amount of whiskey makes it very strong!!  I use 7oz of whiskey and it is almost perfect.  Another good - reduce the almond flavouring by half - perfect!  Not so good - my next batch will be made with 1 cup of heavy cream as I will never again substitute half and half or even half heavy cream with half milk.  This recipe truly needs the total amount of heavy cream (whipping cream for us Canadians).  The cream is a splurge but go for it!  Lastly, I have also made a batch substituting the almond for coconut extract and this is also yum!  A bit more like Baileys.  My next batch I will boost the coffee by just a bit - not much, just a bit!  You can always add, but never take away :).  Although I have been doctoring this recipe, it is excellent and far superior to a lot of other Baileys recipes!  It is all about personal preference.  Regardless, this is a winner!  Don't hesitate to try it!",

So...I loved it!  And instead of 1 cup of cream, I used 1/2 cup of cream and 1/2 cup of milk; I found it a little too thick with straight cream.  I left out the almond extract (simply because I'm not a big fan) and increased the vanilla a little bit.  I also reduced the whiskey by a third, so you should spike to taste.  There's no need to use a blender; I just stirred it with a long-handled whisk and it stayed mixed just fine.  I have never had to take home any of this drink after a party. \r\n",

EVERYONE really got excited about this and demanded the recipe.  i heated 1/4 cup skim milk over medium heat and dissolved the coffee, then added about 25 milk chocolate chips (in place of the syrup) and melted them until the mixture was smooth.  i then removed it from the heat and combined the other ingredients in a large bowl (i cut the cream and whiskey down to 3/4 cup and the almond down to 1/2 tsp.)  then i gradually whisked in the chocolate mixture.  i tried this recipe with several kinds of whiskey, and i discovered that canadian whiskeys produce a more desirable flavor.  this is a very quick and easy recipe; a must try!",

It has gotten tremendous raves from all.  While I am not a big tweaker of recipes, I have a few tiny changes that seem to have been a hit.  First of all, I use only Jameson Irish Whiskey.. the most important ingredient.  I use a cup and a half.  As for the extracts, I only us the real stuff, not imitation. A full teaspoon of vanilla and no more than 3/4th of the almond.   For the sweetened condensed milk, only carnation will give the best results.  The mix is very thick, and I usually also add an ounce of two or half and half, but the full cup of heavy cream is absolutely necessary.  Lastly, I am generous with the chocolate syrup. 2 generous tablespoons.  For the coffee, folgers decaf. (I know, theres plenty of caffeine already in this drink, but the folgers decaff gives a nicer overall flavor)  These ingredients make this an expensive drink, but you will find that most of the people who taste it will tell you its the absolute best irish cream they ever had!!  (Note, other recipes call for eggs in the mix.. which is totally not necessary)   Good luck, I promise you will find this the best recipe you can find for genuine irish cream.",

The second time I cut the whiskey to 1 cup, and the almond flavoring to just under 1/4 tsp. That was much better. The third time, I didn't have any heavy cream, so I just added 1 cup of skim milk, and I think it was the best batch yet. The heavy cream makes it really thick, almost like a milkshake. Skim milk of course thins it, but you get the same amount of creaminess (I think) and less calories. This stuff is best after it's been in the refrigerator overnight--the flavors are fully blended. Great stuff!",
