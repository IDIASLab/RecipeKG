My hubby loves sauce so I put BBQ sauce on his.  I ate mine with just the rub.  I gave mine a 5 star rating.  He gave his a 4 said that the herbs interfered with the BBQ sauce.  That bein said I think that this recipe is Da Bomb.  Love it and will continue to use it.  Thank you so much for posting.",
