Also instead of making the logs (and therefore a mess) I baked the meatloaf using a 12-cup muffin tin spraying it with olive oil first. Then you have neat little servings already portioned out.",

I found that if i served the vegetables on the side as stated in the recipe, that my dog either picked them out, or ate them and did not digest them fully (ask me how I know...). So I just put all the vegetables called for in the food processor and chopped them very finely, then mixed with the rest of the ingredients and proceeded as directed in the recipe. Nothing picked out this time! My dog ate up the whole thing. My dog is old...15 years old...so maybe some of those vegetables were too hard to chew, maybe her digestion isn't as efficient as it used to be, but whatever the reason, changing the preparation as I did worked for us. If you have an older or picky dog I recommend you try this. Also, I always add some flaxseed oil and some ground flaxseed to this before I serve it. It's great for the coat, and helps dogs with arthritis.",

Personally I haven't eaten white bread since I was a child. I prefer whole wheat myself. If you consider the recipe ingredients you will see that it contains 1 cup of rolled oats and 1 cup of wheat germ. Also in the original recipe the vegetables that surrounded the loaves were mashed prior to placing in the storage containers to allow for easier digestion. My dogs always picked at these and often left them uneaten. The recipe was changed by the editors when they reviewed it.",

The only changes I made after reading other reviews was I boiled and mashed the potato and added it in the mix and I added cooked brown rice instead of the oats and wheat germ. I didn't cook the pieces of potato carrots and celery around the sides. Also I did mine in two regular-sized muffin tins sprayed with cooking spray for about 50 min. I'll be freezing all the extras.

I did not do the last step and add the big pieces of celery and carrot. I thought that was a little too much. All in all it's not too much work and the results are well worth it.
