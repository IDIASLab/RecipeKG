I of couse loved that it was so quick and easy plus it's ingredients that I always have on hand. I served it with an assortment of pretzels (sourdough honey wheat regular etc.) and those new crackers that are half pretzel and half cracker. The sweetness of the raspberry preserves and honey really balance out the mustard nicely - I will definitely make this again. Thanks SHORECOOK for such a great recipe!",

We really LOVED the flavor that the raspberrry preserves added to this, and I agree w/ tat2, this would make a wonderful glaze for chicken or even pork chops.

My daughter is a pretzel addict so I try to make extra for her and she takes a little container to school some days in her lunch with crispy pretzels. Yeah - it is that good. So simple to put together takes no time to do. It is well balanced in flavors. Sometimes I make a half a batch without the raspberry and add jalapeno powder - about 1/2 teaspoon - for a very spicy dip. Good recipe - you should try it!",
