As I don't have a large family I changed the servings to 4 to try out the recipe. It yielded about 2 cups of granola. I lined a large baking sheet with foil and sprayed it with PAM spray. I actually had the cinnamon suggested I had bought from a spice store. It has a much stronger taste than traditional cinnamon. The cinnamon and vanilla really came through. Only issue I had was that the oatmeal mixture was not coming together. I ended up doubling the maple syrup and corn oil. I also added a sprinkle of sea salt. Both were good ideas. As I was only making 1/4 of the recipe I watched it closely in the oven. I took it out after about 25 minutes stirring every 7-8 minutes. It still got a light brown color and a crisp to it. I tried a little with cranberries first and found them too sweet for this. I opted for using golden raisins instead. Going to try tomorrow with a parfait.",

I did add some additional maple syrup thinking that might resolve the issue but that didn't do the job. I always have a good supply of dried fruits on hand so I added pineapple cranberries apricots and blueberries. Also watch your timing in the oven this browned up pretty quickly for me. I eat a lot of yogurt for breakfast and love the crunch that a granola topping adds so I'm always looking for new granola recipes. Although this did taste good there are other recipes on this site that I prefer and it's doubtful I'll make this again.",

I used ground flax seed instead of wheat germ to make the granola gluten free. I also used real maple syrup from New York and not the \"maple syrup\" you typically buy at the store (Aunt Jemima Log Cabin etc.) I increased the maple syrup and used 1/2 cup for the half recipe. I baked on a foil lined cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray and gently stirred only once midway through baking. The granola resulted in tons of clumps... the result I was hoping for. I used dried cranberries as the recipe stated but other dried fruit and nuts would be great in this granola recipe. As others have stated an added bonus to this recipe is how great this recipe makes your house smell.",
