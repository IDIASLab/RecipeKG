This is a tasty combination of cheesy-creamy with just the right amount of tang from the Italian dressing. This mixture can be mixed up early in the day and then spread on the baguette slices just prior to baking later. We enjoyed them best right out of the oven but they were still good even when they cooled down. And as a bonus they're EXTREMELY quick and easy! Melanie Wiens Craddock thanks for the new appetizer it's a keeper.",
