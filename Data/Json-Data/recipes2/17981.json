I pressed the tartar into a bowl to create a mold flipped in onto a small dish and served on a platter with sesame wontons which they devoured. I also substituted 1tbls. of tamari for oil and added a tsp. of chopped onions. Sesame wontons are easy: cut wontons diagonally to make triangles.(Make at least 48pcs. people love them!) Arrange on a cookie sheet with parchment(or lightly oiled). Spray or brush lightly with olive oil and sprinkle sesame seeds. Bake at 350degrees for 5-6 minutes.",
