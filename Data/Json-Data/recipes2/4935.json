                "reviewBody": "Cook time and flavor are spot on. This was extremely tender and juicy. There is a problem with the execution though. The spice mixture clumps into a big ball  making it impossible to rub it all over the chicken. I went ahead and just packed it on the chicken as good as I could hoping once the skin started rendering it would be enough to loosen the spice mixture up but that was a no go. I ended up having to spoon it off as best as I could into the roasting pan. I then added a cup of chicken broth and mixed it up as best as I could, and then I basted it frequently until it was done. Again, flavor was good but I can't help but wonder if an ingredient was left out or there is a step missing? Everything was going smooth until the mustard went in. I do love the flavor of it with chicken but I think it was the problem. I'd like to try this again but will use mustard powder instead to see if that fixes the texture issue.",
