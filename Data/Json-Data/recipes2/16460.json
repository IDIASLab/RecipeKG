I used 1 \u00bd teaspoons of raspberry extract instead of vanilla. For the other batch I made it just as the recipe said. I scooped the truffles with a melon ball scoop to make them uniform but still rolled by hand. After I rolled the truffles I put them on a cookie sheet on wax paper and put them in the freezer. While they were in the freezer I melted milk chocolate. I took out about a dozen truffles at a time and I dipped them. I put them on wax paper laid on my counter to set and continued to dip the remainder. I let them all set and my taste tester, my husband, told me that I needed to dip them again to get the nice thick coat of chocolate like Harry and Davids. I dipped them again after they had set the first time. For the raspberry ones I melted red dipping chocolate and drizzled over the top to distinguish them from the others. I was bringing them to a party so on some of the other chocolate ones for the kids I put on sprinkles and crushed candy canes while the chocolate was still a little tacky. The only problem I found was the candy cane toped ones didn\u2019t store longer than a couple of days. The rest of the chocolate ones I drizzled some with white chocolate and some with dark chocolate. Next year I am going to take half of the chocolate batch and when I roll the truffle put a hazelnut in the middle. Thanks Jenny for the recipe it will be a new Christmas tradition!",

                "reviewBody": "With a few changes, some recommended by others, these live up to their name of being easy and decadent.  I reduced the confectioner's sugar and chocolate chips to 2 cups each, added 2 oz. of Baker's Reserve 225th Aniv. 70& Cocoa Dark Bittersweet chocolate and 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream.  I got 62 truffles. I used the large size of a melon baller as I was putting the finished truffle into paper bon-bon cups.  My biggest recommendation is shaping.  Even the melon baller would not work if the mixture was out of the refrigerator more than 10 minutes.  So I drop dollops of mixture on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet, refrigerated for another 30 minutes and then rolled into balls.  This produced a nicely shaped truffle.  I refrigerated again for another 10 mintues before rolling in selected coatings. I processed the nuts into a  meal using a food processor, doing the same for the coconut.  Both looked awesome as did the cocoa powder coating.  I also dipped some into melted Baker's White Chocolate and Baker's German Sweet chocolate.  I used Ghiradelli chcolate chips.  All these top of the line ingredients produced a creamy, yummy truffle that were gobbled down by the recipients. Once shaped and coated, they do not need to be refriegerated to hold shape.  A keeper recipe",

                "reviewBody": "Absolutely divine! I read some other reviews and found that some had trouble rolling. I by accident found a combination of chocolate that makes it easier to roll and less time to sit in the fridge: Keep the powdered sugar and cream cheese and vanilla the same but for the chocolate melt 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips and 6 oz brick form dipping chocolate. The dipping chocolate is much more firm than chocolate chips and it hardens quicker. Just adding those 6 oz allows for the mixture to be ready to roll after only 20 minutes in the fridge. The chocolate is sticky enough to hold crushed nuts or whatever you like to roll it in. Thank you for a very easy and delicious recipe!",

However I found them too sweet and a little too hard as opposed to melt-in-your-mouth tender. The 2nd batch I only used 2c of icing sugar and 2c of choco chips. I added 2 oz of bittersweet chocolate and 2 TBS of 15% cream (heavier cream is good too). This kept it sweet enough but more chocolatey. It was still easy to handle and form ie. was not runny into a perfect little truffle ball but once you pop it into your mouth it just melts and you wonder what you did to deserve this. I also divided the recipe in 2 and used 2-3TBS of brandy to one half and 2-3TBS of rum to the other. You only feel/taste the alcohol if you have stored it at least overnight.",

Granted I've never rolled truffles before so this could be totally normal. They were just a little difficult to work with. BUT DEFINITELY WORTH IT! They are yummy! I added mint oil to the truffle mix and then dipped in green melting chocolate (with more mint oil added) and sprinkled with crushed candy canes. They are gorgeous and delicious! The flavor rivals Andes after dinner mints and my husband who was sick of eating all the chocolate I made at Christmas this year actually felt refreshed after putting this final piece of candy in his mouth. I'll be adding these truffles to my holiday gift bags for years to come. I also made a 2nd batch with peanut butter. They rolled a lot easier for some reason. After rolling I dipped them in dark chocolate. Creamy inside with the shell outside. Delicious!",

Than I rolled them in cocoa powder, confectioner's sugar, chopped hazelnuts or pistachio. And (yes, there's more), I also melted some semisweet chocolate chips and dipped some uncoated truffles before letting the chocolate coating solidify in the fridge. Simply, this recipe is very versatile and you can adjust it according to your whims ;) P.S.

That s coming from someone with a huge sweet tooth! Even on the kid test only half of them liked these truffles. They melt in the hand never mind making it to your mouth. If you do decide you have to try these dip them in some other type of chocolate for a candy coating. Plus it s a huge recipe I ended up throwing away half of them. Oh yeah by the time you ve made them and dipped them AND decorated all the truffles half your day is gone. Definitely not worth it.",
