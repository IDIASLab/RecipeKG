My husband and I enjoyed them and felt that the juicy nature of the raw peppers was a nice counterpart to the kind of soggy mushy feel of the cheesy brat filling. Our kids were just so-so on it - they are anti-peppers so we served theirs on crackers. For my husband and I I also sauteed some greens in a skillet with a clove of minced garlic and mixed that into the cheesy brat mix. That added a more virtuous feel to the meal.",

Wearing laytex gloves while working with jalapenos was a great tip. Other people in my family who are spicy challenged want me to make them with sweet peppers and sweet sausage. This was a great appetizer for a bbq Using laytex gloves was a good tip. I also suggest refrigerating the sausage mixture to firm it up. The firmer mixture makes it easier to stuff the peppers. Every family function these are expected to be made. Last time I made them; instead of adding bacon bits- I wrapped the stuffed peppers with a slice of bacon. Hold it together with a toothpick. This added 20 more minutes to the bake time. If you want the bacon crispy put your toaster oven on toast or a George Foreman grill is great.",
