Pretty much, I do not tweak it, with exception of making gluten free bread crumbs and subbing them for panko.  I, also, use this recipe for leftover poultry.  When used with poultry, I add some Parmesan to the breadcrumbs and generally, season with Penzey\u2019s buttermilk ranch salad dressing mix.  I bake these, on parchment, in my Cuisinart super convection toaster oven, they come out crisp, golden and oil free.  This is a fall back keeper recipe and is always a welcome dinner in my house.",

Added capers and left out the lemon juice - they're a bit fussy to make with the raw fish, but delicious! Added a couple minutes baking time due to the uncooked fish.  Will do this one again for sure.",
