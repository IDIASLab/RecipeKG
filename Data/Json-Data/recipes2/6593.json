It reminds me of the cranberry salsa I used to be able to get on grilled fish tacos in fall at my favorite taco shop. I can't say the cranberry flavor is strong. It is just all around delicious similar to other sweet fruit salsas you may have had with the sweet element contrasted with cilantro and red onion. My mom commented that it was 'sweet' and my cranberry hating sister said she loved it. I served it with Fritos Scoops as an appetizer before thanksgiving dinner this year. It was a hit and very festive!",
