(usually large organic...baby carrots ok too just more casual.); Alfalfa or buckwheat honey (you'll never go back to clover or wildflower honey); Michigan cherries craisins and cranberries are all good. Prefer no sugar or other chemicals added. (Carrots are sweet enough; just want the cherry taste.) This recipe is for about a pound of carrots. I cut the large carrots into 2\" slices then sliced them into quarters. If the carrot is really big into six slices. They end up like mouth-size carrot sticks. Two pounds can be prepared in 10 minutes. The less butter the better. (we hardly ever use it) The recipe \"as is\" feels like I'm eating butter. So at least half it. The stronger-tasting honey is more for flavor than sweetener. We LOVE this!",

Not sickening sweet at all nice compliment to the carrots. Definitely will make again!",

The carrots and flavor were delicious but the dried cherries I bought turned out to be stale with a strange flavor. Ruined the dish. What a disappointment. No reflection on the recipe. Unfortunately good dried cherries are hard to find in small southern towns. The prepackaged ones have too much artificial junk in them and are too sweet. I bought enough to make this dish for Christmas and sadly had to throw them away. I hope to find some great cherries and try again. Anyone have any suggestions on how to be sure dried cherries are not too old? Thanks. Linda",
