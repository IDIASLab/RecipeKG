I thought it might taste just like eating tomato sauce.  Anyway, I reversed the amounts with 32 oz. of 99% fat free broth and 15 oz. of tomato sauce.  I may experiment with the proportions in the future.  I also added one chopped onion instead of using only one slice & reduced the basil quite a bit, due to family preference.  Finally I added whole wheat pasta separately to the soup at the table so the pasta wouldn't get too mushy when the leftovers were reheated.",
