I had no limes or lemons:( But I did have lime juice and added that plus some sugar-free orange jello mix. Pretty tasty! Just make sure to put it in the freezer overnight so you can have it nice and firm for breakfast:P The kiwis and citrus were really yummy together and I'd recommend the cucumber for a refreshing undertone.",

I added a lot more honey and ice but still didn t reach that sweetness level that typically comes with perfectly-fresh fruit. I think this is more like a slushy rather than a smoothie and I really missed the traditional yogurt (either fresh or frozen) that typically makes it creamy. The other thing that I wasn t crazy about was peeling the citrus fruit which is a lot more time consuming than grabbing a handful of fruit to throw into the blender. We all have different taste preferences so I don t want to discourage anybody from trying this as it may be perfect for others. I love smoothies but there are many others on this site that I like better.",
