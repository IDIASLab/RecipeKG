I made it again and added another 6 ozs of frozen lemonade and kept the pineapple juice out (I had no cans of pineapple or pineapple juice): I used fresh cut pineapple that I crushed a little an apple a lime (peeled) and two Clementine (peeled) again I used Moscato and no soda. This time it was amazing. I think that my first try with this would have been good if I had not left the peels on the fruit.",
