Because we love olives a little heat and some crunch I also added some chopped green olives that happened to be stuffed with jalapeno (the heat) and about a 1/4 cup of finely diced seet red peppers (for crunch and a bit of color). A pound of cream cheese makes 2 large cheese balls I would probably cut the recipe in half unless you entertain alot or are having a crowd over.",
