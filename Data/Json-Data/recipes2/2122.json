In a large pot I added the beans, tomatoes, beef broth and the turkey sausage and spices. When the sweet potatoes were ready, I drained them add gently folded them into the pot.

I omitted the diced tomatoes and just used the 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes.  It is not necessary to precook the sweet potatoes.  They will cook in the chili.
