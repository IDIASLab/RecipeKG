The soup is blended in a blender, so it comes out so creamy and thick! If you like Vidalias, you'll love this soup. You can make a lighter version by using milk and no heavy cream.",

After this is was pretty good, just not what I was expecting. I put the soup in the blender on the liquify setting, and the consistency I got was that of cream of wheat. Not bad, but not great either. I would give this four stars with the added spices, but I can't say I will make this again. It was fun to try it, though!",
