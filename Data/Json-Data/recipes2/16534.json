Instead of the apple I use a whole pitted plum. Instead of OJ I use 1/2 cup of apple juice. Instead of soy milk and tofu I use 7oz of Coconut milk!! I prefer using a full 6oz of flavored yogurt. For the grand finale I mix in 2 tablespoons of dried bee pollen in lieu of the barley grass. Blend it all up and I am off to a great start in the morning.",
