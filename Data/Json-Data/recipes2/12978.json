We didn't have jar cheese sauce so we made \"Glen's Cheese Sauce.\" I think I would always use that as the cheese base instead of something processed. We decided to leave out the bouillon and just added more chicken broth at the end to thin the consistency out a little. We were confused by what \"ground red chili pepper\" is exactly. We replaced with cayenne pepper. Wow! That was spicy which we both like. But I can't serve it to my son so I think we would reduce that by half or use paprika instead.",
