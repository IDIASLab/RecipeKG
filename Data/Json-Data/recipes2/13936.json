I melted the white chocolate over low heat with a T. of vegetable oil and then added the 1 T. peppermint extract. I was afraid the mint would be too strong (because it smelled strong) but it wasn't. I also took people's advice and made two separate batches of the chocolate layer so it wouldn't harden. I layered it choc. mint choc. The white chocolate actually turned out although it was a little bit harder than the chocolate layers. But it was a hit with my family. Thanks!",

We doubled the amount of mint used and it realli brought out the minty taste. A tip: smoothing out the melted choco chips with a wooden spoon will actually make the surface rougher its better if the chocolate chips are melted more into a liquidy substance and let it fill the pan by itself. Family members and friends alike all enjoyed it! The absolute best recipe that I ever used! X)",
