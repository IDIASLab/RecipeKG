One suggestion - serve this salad right away: if it sits too long the avocado begins to soften and break down and kind of \"melts\" all over the tomatoes - it still TASTES delicious but it LOOKS better/the colors are more vibrant of you serve it right away. I will definitely make this again and again!",
