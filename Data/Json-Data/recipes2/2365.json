Didnt have any grapes on hand. Chunked up a couple of slices of pineapple and tried to puree them in my blender - no go so added a couple of cherry tomatoes and about 1/8c apple Juice. The result was AMAZING! Even hubby who is not a big fan of salads LOVED this one - last week we ate in 3 days in a row! Thank you both very much for the inspiration!",
