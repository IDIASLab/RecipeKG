I think the combination of my bananas not being too ripe and not enough peanut butter had me a little dissatisfied.  I'm going to let the rest of my bananas ripen a little more, add a little more PB and maybe a little vanilla extract the next time.  \n\nAlso, I don't recommend leaving the bananas in the freezer so long.  I had mine in for 4 hours and I had to wait for them to defrost a bit before I could use them in the food processor.  So if you do leave them in a long time, give them some time out to get a little softer to better blend in the food processor.",
