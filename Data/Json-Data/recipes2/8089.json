I stir-fried the the other veggies for a few minutes added the partially cooked potatoes and then the beef. Because my leftover roast beef had been in the freezer for a while and was a little dry I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and a package of gravy mix and let it heat thoroughly for 5 to 10 minutes. So it came out more like a beef stew than a hash but I would make it again. The family liked it. Thanks for the idea.",
