I do a double batch, cook them between two pans on the stove to speed things up and freeze them. Letting the batter sit makes for a fluffy pancake. Beautiful and tasty,too.",

For a healthier version use all organic ingredients if you can. Use whole grain flour. Replace the white flour with more buckwheat. Replace the safflower oil with virgin cold pressed coconut oil use whole grain oatmeal (e.g. McCann's Quick and Easy \"Steel Cut\" instant oatmeal has not been pulverized thus a lower hypoglycemic index) and use raw honey. For improved flavor add tsp. of Vanilla. Then of course use real butter and organic pure maple syrup as the coupe de grace!",

It's best when using oatmeal or wheat flour that you make the batter beforehand and let it sit and soak up some of the liquid. I was cautious and ran the wisk through the dry ingredients before adding the wet then stirred the batter until just incorporated. These pancakes were light and fluffy with a slight nutty texture. Very good. You couldn't tell they were healthy. My kids and I loved them. I'm so making these again.",

For added protein I added about 2 Tbsp of ground almonds to the batter. I made a double batch and froze the extras; a double batch makes about 20 pancakes. Putting some fresh grated apple in the batter would also be a nice addition that I'll try next time. This is a keeper!",
