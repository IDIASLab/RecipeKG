                "reviewBody": "4 pans?  Eh.  I agree with the comments about the mess, and personally think that each pot being so \"sterile\" leaves a whole lotta flavor out of this equation.  So I did it with two pots -- one for the boiling of pasta, and the second for everything else.  Cook the chicken and peppers FIRST, in a large skillet.  Drain a little fat, if you want, and then directly add the cream/herb mixture.  Cook that down.  When the pasta is almost ready (about 1 minute short of finish), drain it and add it to the skillet.  Mix all that love up together.  Hot and luscious -- you'll be eating all your flavors from one pan, instead of rinsing much of the taste down the drain.  Other than the prep style, I thought the ingredients worked really well -- thank you!",

                "reviewBody": "WHOOO-HOOOO!!! This one's a winner! I read the reviews before I made mine, and here's what I did: I preheated my large skillet nice n hot (just before the olive oil in it started to smoke). Then, I added the diced chicken. As the chicken started to cook, I added salt & pepper (a fair amount). \n\n\nWhile the chicken was going, I heated 2 cups of heavy cream and 2 T butter. I didn't have a drop of milk in the house, and I didn't want to use a whole stick of butter, so... there ya go. :)\n\n\nNow, back to the chicken: About halfway through the cooking, I tossed in 3 healthy cloves of minced garlic, 2 diced scallions, 1/2 green pepper, and 1/2 yellow pepper (no red in the store that day).\n\n\nI also used 1 cup of Parm instead of 2/3 (all you cheese lovers out there know what I'm talkin' about, wink, wink). And I doubled the dried spices, while omitting the chives (didn't have any, and I had already used fresh scallions anyway).\n\n\nThis dish is absolutely wonderful. For those who noted a bland taste, I would recommend seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper, and also tossing in garlic AND scallions along with the peppers while chicken is still cooking. Doing this allows the flavor of all these wonderful veggies to enhance the chicken and the entire dish. \n\nI reheated this one stove top the next day: I poured about 1/5 cup of chicken broth into a sauce pan. Then, I added the Chicken Rotini and stirred occasionally while cooking it over medium low to medium heat. Tastes fresh!\n\n\nDeliciou",

The only downfall is the 4 pots/pans you have sitting on your stovetop just to make this! Oh well the taste was good. If you think you can handle it-try cooking the chicken/peppers at the same time your letting your sauce thicken. That way your noodles chicken and sauce are done at almost the same time resulting in a hot meal! The only change I made was to add a dash of garlic/onion powder to the sauce when whisking in the other spices and while sauting the chicken/bell peppers-added some minced onion/garlic and some fresh sliced mushrooms. Tasty stuff Terry!",
