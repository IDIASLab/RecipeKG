For the cake I used Duncan Hines devil\u2019s food cake box mix (15.25 oz), 3/4 cup whole milk plain Greek yogurt, 3/4 c water, 1/2 c canola oil, 3 eggs, and no added chocolate. Baked at 325 for 30 min in two dark-metal 9\u201d round pans, with a round of parchment at the bottom of each pan and sprayed with Baker\u2019s Joy. It was moist and good flavor, and held together well- it was easy to handle and frost! Filled and frosted with Creamy Chocolate Frosting (from allrecipes), using 1 1/2 recipe for 18 servings. Hope that helps someone. Next time I plan to add 1 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter.",
