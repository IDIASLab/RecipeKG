It's no different than the basic egg salad my mom made for us kids and spread on saltines for a quick and cheap lunch only it's a little lazier. My kids love it just as much as I did at their age which totally tickles me. I don't add as much onion as the recipe states just a few real big stalks of green onion and the amount of mayo is really purely up to the makers taste. I like to eat this with a little hot sauce a little garlic powder and fresh ground pepper. Like the recipe says it's best eaten right away while the crackers are still crunchy and it's best with a cold Coke.",
