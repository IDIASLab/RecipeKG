I just about got lynched! Needless to say, I've made them every year since (about 20 years). These are best if you use Meyers Original Dark Rum\u00ae chilled, and Nabisco\u00ae 'Nilla wafer cookies. They are at their peak if you make them 2 days in advance. Remove from fridge 30 minutes before serving.",

These are nice and rich exactly what I was looking for. They've now been in my fridge for 2 days and I'll be bringing them to a party tomorrow night. I didn't put them on wax paper or in a bag with icing sugar I just rolled them up and then dipped half in coconut and half in cocoa (next time I'll coat a third in icing sugar to give people even more variety.) No fuss no mess no baking and you only use the stove for 5 minutes. Thanks a lot for this recipe!",

I liked the ease of this recipe better than that one. So I decorated some with powdered sugar and some with unsweetened cocoa powder (both best sifted) And then I melted some chocolate chips in the microwave and (after the rum balls had been in the fridge for a while) rolled some in that. Of the chocolate ones I (immediately!) sprinkled crushed nuts on some of them. And the others after putting back in the fridge to set I melted white chocolate and did a small design on the top. The presentation is amazing even with my lack of decorating talent.",

I didn't shake them in the bag w/ powdered sugar I just rolled them in the powdered sugar on a plate and that worked well. I will def be making these again...they were very easy and yummy!

While in Tech school in the Air Force (years ago) a buddy's grandmother had sent them to him and I was lucky enough to be able to try them all remember was Wow there's some rum in those! After trying a few other recipes without coming close to what I remembered I saw this recipe and thought Hmmm this one has 3 times the rum of the other recipes. I didn't have Meyers dark rum but I had Captain Morgan and tried it. These are what I remember having years earlier very good. I received compliments from everyone that had them. I do think next year I use just a little more rum and make it Sailor Jerry since it's 92 proof to boost them up a little bit. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "There are so many different rum ball recipes out there, I wasn't sure which to try!  I opted for this recipe because it didn't include nuts, and uses chocolate instead of just cocoa powder. I think these rum balls are more fudge-like and less gritty than others I've tried.\n\nA couple of things that might be helpful to others who try the recipe:\n\nMy box of Nilla wafers was only 11oz, so I ended up adding two graham crackers (the equivalent of 1oz) to give me the full 12oz of cookie crumbs.  I don't know if that was necessary, but if you get a couple extra rum balls out of it, it doesn't hurt, right?  \n\nChocolate can be easy to scorch, so I would recommend melting your chocolate in a double-boiler.  An easy way to fake a double boiler is to put a couple of inches of water into a sauce pan and then set a similarly sized Pyrex bowl on top of it, so that your bowl is resting on the top rim of your pan. The boiling water in the pot gently heats your bowl, allowing your chocolate to melt without risk of burning it.  \n\nFor booze, I used a combination of Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum and Tuaca.\n\nAs a personal preference, I used honey instead of corn syrup and added a couple of dashes of cinnamon. I think they added complexity to the flavor.\n\nI rolled the rum balls in granulated sugar because I like the look of it better, and it's less messy to eat.\n\nP.S.  I highly recommend wearing food-safe gloves when rolling out your rum balls.  No one wants to eat your skin cells in their dessert.",
