I may skip them altogether or try this recipe with fresh mushrooms. I thought it was fantastic and I served it over Trader Joe's Garlic and Chive Linguine. I'm also tempted to try this with canned clams to decrease the cost. In terms of fresh clams you want to make sure to buy clams that are tightly closed. Take them home and immediately take them out of their bag (or they'll suffocate). To clean them scrub them with a brush and place them in a large bowl of cold fresh water. Let them sit there for at least 30 mins to filter out the sand. Gently take them out and rinse them and they are ready to use. It's crazy to see how much sand ends up in the bottom of the cleaning bowl! Update: I made it again but used fresh portabella mushrooms and they were excellent. It did turn the broth base a little brown but was MUCH better than dehydrated mushrooms!",

The result is actually like a rich (but not heavy) garlicky clam soup so I dished out the pasta in big deep pasta bowls (plates are impossible) and poured the clam concoction over the pasta in each bowl.
