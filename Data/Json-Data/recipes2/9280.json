Um where are the vegetables that are in its name?\" Green onion and cilantro are a flavoring garnish not a vegetable so I guess it was the bottles of juice that gave this recipe its \"Vegetables?\" The taste wasn't bad at all but it was so liquidy due to how much chicken broth and vegetable juice went into it. Even with the cheese and tortilla chips we just didn't like texture or lack thereof - my 9 year old said it reminded her of a bowl of the \"sauce served over burritos in a Mexican restaurant.\" I salvaged the leftovers the next day by adding a can of drained black beans a 1/2 c. of frozen corn and a heavy handful of sauteed zucchini and bell pepper.",
