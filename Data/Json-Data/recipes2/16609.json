Will play with this to get a standard juice amt and probably add another cup of milk. Was good alone but fantastic served with raspberries and blueberries on top. Tweak Edit: I had half a can of sweetened milk to use and though of this recipe. I only had 2 lemons juiced 2 and zested 1. Half can of sc milk 1 cup of ff half and half 1/2 cup whole milk. DD liked it MUCH better this way for eating alone less chalky. I think 4 juiced and 2 zested would suit our sour tastes better and next time I'll double my tweaks because it makes a tasty and cool treat in the heat.",
