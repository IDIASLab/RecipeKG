I have made with both A-1 and Heinz 57.  I prefer A-1.  Also, I recommend using a zesty italian dressing.  It gives your meat a little more kick.  \r\nThis makes a lot of marinade and I used half right away and frooze the other half in a zip lock back with steaks for future use.\r\nFinal word of warning, be careful this burns easy with the honey in the marinade.",

After grilling, they were very tender with a mild sweet flavor.  My husband loved them!  Thanks Kristen!",

I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate all day. Perfect with a baked potato!",

We learned that you have to watch these steaks cook on the grill very carefully as the honey (we think) causes the steaks to burn if unattended. LOTS of flavor!!!
