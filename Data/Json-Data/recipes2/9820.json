The bacon flavor and maple syrup paired perfectly together and gave the beans a nice smokey sweet flavor. The mustard flavor was more dominant than I expected both in flavor and color of the dish. We love mustard but you might want to scale back if you don't love mustard. After checking the beans at 2 hours I decided to skip step 5. They were pretty done and starting to split and we prefer them with some firmness to them. This recipe takes some time so plan ahead.",
