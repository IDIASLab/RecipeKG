The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of the butterscotch ice cream topping, which I didn't have on hand), and it was good.  The second time, I made two small altertions that I felt really livened it up.  First, I added a heaping spoonful of peanut butter (didn't measure--just do it to your tastes) to the pudding mix.  And second, I added a layer of hot fudge topping (about 2/3 of an 11.75 ounce jar) on top of the pudding (between that and the whipped cream).  The combination of the buttescotch, PB and chocolate was awesome!  Very easy to make, and everyone loved it.  ",
