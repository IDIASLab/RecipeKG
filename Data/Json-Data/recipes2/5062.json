Peas are readily available all year round; when it's in season, I have also used asparagus, zucchini, green or wax beans.  It's also nice to put some fresh cracked pepper over it when it is done. I have tried this recipe with canned beets. It does not come out nearly as well, the beets are way to soft.",

The directions were incredibly easy to follow which I was very thankful for. We made a few changes to the recipe: instead of the Swiss chard we used kale (because it's what we had) and we topped the salad with an over medium egg. It was so good! Seriously.So.Good. I was so excited about it that I totally forgot to add the feta but I think it would just add more flavor. Thanks for posting this recipe! We already have plans to make it again next week!",
