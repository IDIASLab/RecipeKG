If so, this is the cake for you. Put on a cute outfit, crank up some tunes, and have a rockin' glass of wine...you're about to land the man of your dreams! No sweat pants allowed during the creation of this ice cream cake...Don't drink more than one glass of wine during its preparation...the coconut is the only thing that should be toasted when this ice cream cake is served. Drizzle some carmel and chocolate sauce on top.",
