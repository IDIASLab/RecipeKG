I combined butter and homemade bread crumbs from a regular loaf of bread and spread them on top of the dish before baking.  This was so delicious!  Thank you for this one.  ",

All my family and friends are mac & cheese lovers and this recipe seems to come out on top out of all the ones I have tried.  I change up the cheeses and use whatever cheese appeals to me on that day/whatever is in the fridge, usually starting with a six-cheese Italian blend and a sharp cheddar.  I sometimes will grate in some extra-sharp cheddar as well.  Some asiago gives it some nice kick.  I have used Monterey Jack as well.  All in all, I try to get about 6 cups of shredded cheese in there (2 more cups than the recipe specifies) to make it super gooey and cheesy.  To the ricotta mixture (the genius part of this recipe that makes it so creamy and wonderful), I throw in a little cayenne pepper, as well as extra amounts of the other seasonings to my taste.  I omit the parsley and grind in a little salt and pepper.  I have also substituted plain greek yogurt for the sour cream.  On top, I throw some plain or Italian panko and an additional layer of cheese.  Delicious!!!  Oh, and I also use cavatappi or cellentani instead of the elbows, but that's pure preference :)",

It is a bit dry, so we increased the ricotta to 3/4 cup and doubled the sour cream.  We used fat free half and half - also doubled - and it turns out very yummy, cheesy and it doesn't last long when served.  Since we increased the liquid parts, we increased the parsley to 1 1/2 T and doubled the Italian seasoning and garlic salt.  AGAIN, the best thing about this recipe is its versitility.  Play with the ingredients until you find your perfect flavor.  You will make it again and again.",
