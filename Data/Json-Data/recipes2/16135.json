                "reviewBody": "My husband and I enjoyed this recipe all summer. Thank you! Here's a similar version for two that honors the original recipe, uses fresh ingredients, and uses a cocktail shaker instead of a blender: Combine into saucepan and bring to boil while stirring or swirling: 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup sugar. Set aside to cool. Juice and strain 3 to 5 lemons and 3 to 5 limes until you have 1 1/2 cups juice. Pour 1 1/2 cups strained juice and 3/4 cup sugar syrup into 18 oz or larger container; stir. This sweet and sour mix will keep in refrigerator for at least a week; stir before each use. Pre-chill 8 oz tumbler glasses in freezer. Rim glasses - (outside rim only) - with fresh lime and coarse kosher salt, if desired. Add 3 pieces of ice to each glass. Fill cocktail shaker with 4 oz sweet and sour (and, this is important, 2 oz of water if using the lesser amount of alcohol); 2 - 3 oz 1800 Reposado or Anejo Tequila; 1/2 - 3/4 oz Grand Marnier; and 1 1/2 - 2 oz Bols Triple Sec Liqueur. Add 4 ice cubes; cover and shake briskly for 10 slow seconds. Strain into pre-chilled glasses with ice; add squeeze of lime to each drink. We love the stronger version, particularly after a hard day, but prefer the lighter version most days. I listed my brand preferences, but any quality products will do. Enjoy!",
