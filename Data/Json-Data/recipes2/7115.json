The 4 cloves of garlic differentiated it from the typical potato soup and it was perfectly in balance with the other ingredients. It did thicken up a bit too much so I thinned it out with more chicken stock. I will start with 3/4 cup mashed potato flakes the next time. What a nice job those mashed potato flakes did on thickening; I'll remember that for other food preparation.",
