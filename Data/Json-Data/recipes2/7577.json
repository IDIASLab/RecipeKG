I just happened to stumble across this recipe, as I was looking for a way to use up some pancetta that I had in the fridge to use up. Glad I found this! Thanks for the recipe!",

I cooked it until the bacon was crisp (way longer than just a few minutes). Also 3 cups of stock waaaay too much. I used 2 packages of ramen and about 2 1/2 cups of stock & it was perfect. Made a little sauce but wasn't overly runny. I hate peas & I barely tasted them so for me that's a good thing. This is a quick \"throw it together\" recipe.",

I used bacon and doubled the amount as we are big fans. I forgot to add the noodles to the bacon onion mixture and let cook for a bit I just added the noodles and broth at the same time. Then I was a bit weirded out by the soggy bacon and thought I was going to be turned off- but I finished out the recipe I did double the noodles and did not double the broth. After adding the parmesan I was left with a thick creamy sauce. My son loved it my picky child only like it. I loved it and I feel like this has given ramen some new uses. My husband is still working in the yard but I will update after he puts his 2 cents in.",

Fresh ground pepper is very important to this dish it wouldn't do to substitute or leave it out.",
