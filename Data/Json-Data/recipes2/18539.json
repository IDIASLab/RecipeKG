It can be made in no time - while the chops are broiling you can easily put together the topping. I used a good quality sauerkraut which I believe gave it an extra kick. I would serve this to company - it has an elegant look.  Appelsauce on the side and the potato and vegetable of your choice!   Thanks submitter!",
