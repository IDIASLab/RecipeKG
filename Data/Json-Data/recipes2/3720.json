Putting the rosemary in the broth/OJ mixture created a lovely flavor that is not overpowering. I did opt to zest an orange and stir it in at the end to enhance the orange flavor. I didn't have pecans so I toasted walnuts it worked just fine. Otherwise everything was exactly as directed and delicious. I served this with the \"Beer Butt Rosemary Chicken\" also found on this site omitting the potatoes from that recipe - great meal with a veggie and green salad.",
