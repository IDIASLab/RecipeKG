I added more balsamic and let it reduce which helped intensify the flavor but I was expecting more from the sauce (and my plums were perfectly ripe and tasty). I'm wondering if mashing one of the plum wedges into the sauce or perhaps adding more thyme to it would add more flavor? You may want to start checking the pork temperature well before 20 minutes because mine reached 145 degrees F at about 12 minutes (oven temps do vary). We enjoyed it it was very moist and tender and I definitely will make this again but I will concentrate on improving the sauce (personal taste preference I suppose).",
