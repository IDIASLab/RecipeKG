I think the problem some of you are having is that I think she means that you should use 1 and a half cups of the dry cornbread mix and make it up according to the box? Personally I used 1c cornmeal (not instant) 1c buttermilk 1/2c flour 2tsp baking powder 1/2tsp baking sodea 2 eggs and 1/4c vegetable oil. This made enough to fill a 8x8 pan and serve about 6 people. Cornbread could have used more vegetables. Probably a large can of corn and maybe 2 bell pepers and a chili pepper would kick it up. But that's just my preference - good like it is!",

I used Bisquick instead of Corn Bread mix I added hot pepper sauce to the batter. I used a shredded Taco cheese mixture of Cheddar pepperjack and Asadero Cheeses in the store bought package. And served it with warm pizza sauce for dipping. It was fantastic. Glad I tried it that way and hope you all do the same!!",
