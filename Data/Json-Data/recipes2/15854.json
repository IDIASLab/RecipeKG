I just added a couple of tablespoons of Merlot wine to the steak pan scraped up the crusty fon and let it reduce a little. Outstanding.

I cooked the filet exactly as instructed (5 minutes on each side gave a med-med/rare) and can say this is fool proof! My fiancee absolutely loved the recipe and ate every morsel with delight.
