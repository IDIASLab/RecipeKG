It went over VERY well! I put the room temp cream cheese, olives with juice, and the pecans in the blender and just pulsed it a couple of times to chop it all up. I didn't add the seasoned salt, (thought it might be to salty with the olive juice) but I did add a small amount of garlic powder!!! WOW what a good dip!!  I have made this three times since Thanksgiving and it all got ate up in no time. (warning...YOU MUST LOVE SALT) as this is very salty. I do love salt so it was great for me. I love to use chip with ripples in them. The cheese MUST come to room temp to do this, OR add a spoon or knife to place on crackers or chips. LOVE the recipe. Thanks so much.",

I did leave out the salt as I felt they would be salty enough. I rolled them in walnuts as they are my favorite. I refrigerated them 30 minutes before slicing with a serated knife that was wiped clean after each slice for a clean cut. Thank you HSHELTON25 for such an EXCELLENT recipe! These will be served for sure when the family gets together for the holidays.",
