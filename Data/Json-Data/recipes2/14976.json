We tried it with and without the syrup and we much preferred it without the syrup because it was too sweet. I have made quite a few stuffed french toast recipes and they usually stuff before cooking. I think that would have made this easier and way more appealing. Neither of us were thrilled with the cold mascarpone and preserves in the center of the hot bread. Because I love all these ingredients I will try this again. Next time I will cut the pockets in the bread. Pan fry as directed. Stuff the mascarpone and preserves. Bake as directed. Will check back in here if that is a better method. Thanks for sharing.",
