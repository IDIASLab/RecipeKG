The butter and vermouth worked together to make a rich, brown pan sauce, the perfect finish to the meaty, sweet (use dry pack!) scallops.",

At least not enough to get excited about making them twice the same way.  Well, that's all changed!  I\u2019ve fallen in love with this recipe, have made it several times, and have no desire to search for another scallop recipe.  The rich butter sauce compliments the scallop\u2019s flavor and doesn\u2019t try to  cover it up like many bread crumb coated recipes.   The best part is, it\u2019s easy to make.  I'm not one to stock fancy flavored cooking oils, so I start with plain olive oil and saute it with a clove of minced garlic before adding the scallops. For a beautiful golden brown color, you really need to get the scallops good and dry by patting them with a paper towel. I leave out the red pepper flakes, but will sprinkle a few over the top of hubby\u2019s since he enjoys a little spice. When you\u2019re done, you will feel like a gourmet chef.",

I used only 1 tablespoon with a bit of the brine. The cooking times are  spot on. The scallops were still nice and tender.
