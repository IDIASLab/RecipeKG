                "reviewBody": "I have a pear tree that is loaded with fruit, so I decided to make some pear bread.  I picked this recipe because I had all the ingredients except the raisins (or so I thought!).\nThe first 2 batches I made I misread the ingredients and used apple cider vinegar instead of apple cider.  For the third batch I used apple cider.  In batch number four I used the vinegar again.  The version with apple cider is dense like pumpkin and zucchini breads tend to be.  Using vinegar, the bread is fluffier and we like it better that way!\nOne other change:  I measure out the allspice and cloves as whole berries and grind them together in a spice grinder before adding.  It should be pretty close, but this gives a more intense flavor than using pre-ground spices.\nGreat recipe!",
