I had to use Italian sausage because that's all I had, I crumbled and browned before using in the stuffing. I was skeptical about using the cheddar with that, but I was so wrong. The flavor combo is great. I did grease the bottom of my dish with a bit of olive oil before placing the tomatoes. I will definitely make these again. A light sprinkle of basil on top the cheese also adds good flavor. My boyfriend who isn't fond of tomatoes had two. Thanks for sharing the recipe :)",

Instead of canned tomatos, I stuffed my red tomatos with diced yellow tomatos.  I used skinless turkey sausage.  I used less breadcrumbs, but added a few flavored (cheddar/garlic) croutons which created wonderful bites of flavor.  I also used colby/jack cheese.  This recipe is so easy to adapt, so don't be afraid to use the ingredients you have on hand.  Last thought, the less juice included (from tomatos) the better.  Enjoy!",
