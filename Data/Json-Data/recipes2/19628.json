I used my own proportions based upon what I thought looked like the right amt.. I halved the recipe to get 6 muffins. Tasty with the addition of hash browns and sausage. This is a 'kitchen sink' recipe if need be clean out fridge and use up that little extra pepper or a few cut up olives etc.. I added some diced sundried tomatoes the sky's the limit. They came out of the pan beautifully no sticking at all. I don't know if it's the recipe or my pan but I'll be making a dozen next time. It's good portion control for new year's dieting. I leave a few in fridge then in the morning I nuke it about 20 seconds to warm it up.",
