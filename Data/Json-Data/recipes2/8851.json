This chai pudding taste really good. I used: AROY-D coconut milk in the box (not the can, which is a less-sweet and less-flavorful coconut milk ); SO FRESH unsweetened cashew milk instead of rice milk; and 1 tablespoon honey instead of 2 tablespoons of maple syrup. Yum! Thank you Utzy Naturals for sharing your recipe. I think the ratios are pretty good.",
