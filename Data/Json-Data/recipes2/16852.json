I did change the recipe to what I had: instead of cream I used milk and I used chocolate chips only instead of a baking square with it (I added 1T chocolate chips for each square.) THANKS SO MUCH! My little brothers loved it.",

Hubby said to please keep this recipe. He loved it! Knowing his favorite flavor is mint chocolate chip I added some peppermint extract to some of the left-over sauce and asked him what he thought. \"Absolutely a winner!\" Either way this sauce is EXCELLENT. It is truly a 5 star recipe in our book!! Thank you Kathy for sharing this EXCELLENT recipe!",
