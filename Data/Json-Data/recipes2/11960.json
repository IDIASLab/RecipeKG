Yes, you can make your own dough but I like Goya discos, they are good, convenient and cheap. I added some adobo Goya (not the chipotle sauce but the powdered adobo which is a blend of spices like garlic powder, salt, cumin, etc) because I found the picadillo a tad bland. To make these appetizer size I cut each round of dough in two semicircles, filled, folded and sealed edges with a fork. You can freeze these before frying, then fry when needed without having to thaw it. My son loves them filled with pizza sauce, mozarella cheese and pepperoni. We call them \"empanadillas de pizza\", or \"pastelillos de pizza\". You can fill them with just cheddar cheese, or with guava paste, cooked shredded chicken... well, whatever you are into. Just make sure you don't burn yourself, the filling is very hot and if you don't seal them right they might leak on you and OUCH!",

Next, I only had ground turkey meat (20 oz) so I used that instead of the ground beef.  Next I couldn't find the Goya Discos to save my life so I finally settled for pie crust sheets.  So because of that I baked these at 425 degrees F for about 20-30 minutes.  The whole batch made 20 medium turnorvers.  I served these with the Mango Salsa (also on this site) and my family went nuts over these and dovoured almost the whole batch.  I kept eating the filling ... so savory and flavorful.  I did season the meat with garlic salt and pepper and also added a bit more sofrito, but other than that I followed the measurements (doubling of course) and this recipe is a keeper.  Thanks so much for this.  My mom was Puerto Rican from Hawaii and she used to make these all the time but she died with the recipe.  It brought back great memories.",

My mother always added a couple of small dashes of cinnamon, yes, cinnamon, to the picadillo (which I, of course, had to do), and it makes such a lovely addition. Either way, though I do recommend trying a dash or two of cinnamon, these are a winner!!",
