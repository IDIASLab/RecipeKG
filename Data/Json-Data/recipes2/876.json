In fact he ate 6 of them with his Pork Pear and Walnut Salad another recipe from AR. They baked up nice light and fluffy. The butter and cheese added nice flavor to the rolls. As with most rolls these were best warm from the oven. But it didn t stop my husband from finishing the cold ones the next day. Easy recipe that will be repeated.",
