I used a combo of fresh and dried shitakes but other than that made as directed. The balance of sour and heat was pleasant when I first made it. However I prepared through step 2 about 2 hrs before serving. It lost some of its original zip. I had to tweak it with soy vinegar and more pepper. I also used a white pepper/black pepper combination for heat. Egg added some cloudiness but did not affect taste. My advice: Have everything prepped but do not go past step 1 until just before serving.",
