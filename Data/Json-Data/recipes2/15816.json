I've used asiago cheese instead of the feta, also different vinegars like white balsamic, white wine and rice wine. Also, not a fan of pine nuts, but almonds go great. If you want your spinach wilted, you can put it in the colandar and then drain the orzo ( you can also substitute a variety of pastas) over the spinach to wilt it without extra cooking. Enjoy.",
