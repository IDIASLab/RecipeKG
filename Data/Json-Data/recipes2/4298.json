I didn't have the bacon ranch dressing so I added crumbled bacon that I had leftover from breakfast. My mother-in-law wants me to make another pan of this so she can take it home with her today. If you don't have cream of chicken soup cream of mushroom would work or cream of broccoli. I am anxious to make this with one of those so my son who is vegetarian can enjoy this as well!",

Might try it next time by reducing mayo/sour cream or cut down from 8 oz to 3 oz cream cheese. But a very creative change of pace!",
