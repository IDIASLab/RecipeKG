I had to punch holes in my pie and dump more coffee over it because even after 12 hours the wafers were still hard. I would say double the amount. Also double the cream cheese- we couldn't even taste it. People at work also said it needed more coffee flavor- even though I added some extra coffee liquor. Is there such a thing as coffee flavored pudding because that might help. This is a great idea in theory but needs to be kicked up a few notches.",

BUT we use more coffee, I drizzle it on the cookies til theyre all wet and softening, every time we make this we do it a little different, and its always tasted amazing, just make sure to keep it cold for atleast 4-5 hours or it'll be runny, but its AMAZING, Im not a fan of coffee, but I can definately taste it in there and this dessert is our favorite, In a family of 4  plus a toddler who wont eat anything, it only lasts a day. Lol. Definately cant want to take it to a family get together for them to try it!",
