Then I tossed it into the food processor and chopped it small and added it to the veal mix. I thought it gave depth that might have been missing. Served on whole wheat rolls with melted brie.

I served them with a Garden Salad with Mustard Greens (regular salad I just replaced half the lettuce with the greens ) stuffed clams & a Pinot Noir I had laying around. Maybe it was the burgers maybe it was the company maybe it was because they were grilled on a cold November day in New England but these burgers were great. I will make these again and highly suggest this recipe to others.",

Let me tell you those burgers were amazing! I'm sure that they are amazing even if you follow the original recipe...but I'm the person that always has to tweak it one way or the other LOL:) enjoy!!!",

I rolled into 8 slider size meatballs and grilled them. No condiments beyond a nice piece of lettuce some homemade aoli (or a little of your favorite mayo). Absolutely a keeper!
