Add in about a cup of Franks Hot Sauce, then about a cup of Ranch dressing ( I do use the cheaper brand for this- doesn't seem to matter) 1/2 a package of finely shredded sharp cheddar and 1 package of cream cheese.  Mix well and put in an 8x8 pan to bake for about 30 min at 350.  Top with cheese and bake again until melted.  Best with tortilla chips.  Tastes GREAT!",

If your going to make it the night before to save oven space don't put the cheese on yet. Make the main part of the dip, put it away and then add the cheese on top the day your going to serve it.(Microwave it if you can't use the oven.) I wasn't thinking and I cooked it all the night before. The cheese was VERY hard, but the dip underneath was good. I think it would have been the best dip ever if the cheese was melted right before. Oh and DON'T add the full amount of hot sauce. I used half of what the recipe called for and it was spicy enough.",
