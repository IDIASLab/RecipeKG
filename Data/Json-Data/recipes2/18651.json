For example I will add a tropical fruit mix (Dole) to the mixture and substitute a mixed fruit jello for the strawberry. I also use two boxes of jello mix instead of one. This is great for showers and parties in that you can basically coordinate the dish with your themes by using different flavors of jello. I always try to use the actual fruit of the jello mix I've selected. Again... great recipe!",

I used one 3oz box of Strawberry gelitan because our store doesn't sell the 1oz boxes. Used an entire can (15 1/4oz) of Dole pineapple chunks (I chopped them up smaller) and that added awesome sweetness to it. Will make it again for sure and will experiment next time with other flavors. My friend puts marshmallows in hers. Had to pass this recipe out was a true hit!!",
