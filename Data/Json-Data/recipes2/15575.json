One word of caution, however: living on Puget Sound, we eat a lot of fresh fish... and good quality tuna should never be cooked \"well done\" or opaque in the middle as you will end up with VERY DRY fish.  It should still be pink in the middle!  Thanks for the GREAT recipe, Doreen!",

Blended all together in food processor leaving the garlic fairly minced. In a glass pie plate poured it over 2- 1/2lb pieces of 1/2\" thick fresh tuna make sure some gets on the bottom of the fish covered with plastic wrap and put in frige 30 min. Removed plastic put in preheated oven at 350 degrees cooking in the marinade. After 10 min flip cook another 10 min then flip again for 10 min if you want it well done as hubby wanted it. Personally I would have taken it out after 20 min with a little pink in the middle as 30 made the tuna dry. Cant wait until it warms up outside to try this on the grill will try xlg shrimp and scallops on the grill with this recipe!",
