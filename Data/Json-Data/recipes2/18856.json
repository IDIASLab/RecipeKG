As soon as I put the sauce in it was clear that the author meant to use significantly smaller potatoes. I put probably 5 times the amount of soy and cayenne in and it was still bland and tasteless from too much potato versus other ingredients. Even if I had used smaller potatoes they still would have come out tasting like ordinary breakfast potatoes and not anything special. I actually wound up turning these into breakfast burritos adding eggs salsa and sour cream wrapped in a flour tortilla. They were really good like that.",

I also was out of sesame seeds but I made do without. Here's a hint- for that \"fiery\" flavor don't premix the cayenne and soy sauce. Start at step two and then add the cayenne and soy sauce directly to the potatoes and veggies. Up the cayenne to a full teaspoon like I did. A pinch of pepper will light the match but a tablespoon will give you fire.;)",
