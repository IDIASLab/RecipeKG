It makes the sauce turn kind of pasty and it's just not a good texture for this recipe. If you omit the flour and just brown the pork in a spray of oil I think this would be much much better. You can still get the spicy flavor by adding some chili paste (such as Sambal Oelek). I agree with other's comments that it could use a bit more salt than is in the recipe. I also think that you can play around with what vegetables you use. We selected red peppers onions and bean sprouts and squeezed lime juice over it all. I'd say if you're at all curious about this recipe give it a try with the change mentioned above.",

We used light coconut milk to save on the fat and did not seem to think it needed any additional salt.  We cooked brown rice with chicken stock and spooned the mixture over top.  This is one of our family's new favorite dishes.  I plan to freeze the leftovers for later since we made 24 servings for that purpose!!!!!  Enjoy.",

I didn't even read the reviews until after I made the recipe. I certainly didn't bread the pork..tenderloin is naturally juicy. I cooked the pork first in a skillet with the lid on. Then I let the meat rest with the lid on. Second I didn't add the wine. Mostly because we are a dry house and I am not big on wine flavor. Mushrooms? nah..too earthy for this exotic dish...they get lost in all the flavors going on. Since it was the day before grocery day I didn't have coconut milk in stock so I used a can of evaporated milk and put some pur coconut extract in it (1 tsp) I also added more curry powder paprika red pepper and more peanut butter. My husband said to feel free to make this any time. There will be a lot of sauce the point is to put it over the rice. Also dont overcook pork because it is high in fat it will dry out. Like I said before put the lid on and let it rest so the juices dont come out.",

My modifications are as follows; first I use cubed chicken instead of pork tenderloin. Secondly I do not bread the chicken but I brown it in a bit of oil (and add the red pepper flakes later when making the sauce). I substitute water for the white wine since I never seem to have any in the house. I cut down the beef boullion to just 1 cube and use only a 1/2 tsp of the pepper flakes so that my kids will eat it. I up the curry powder to 4 tsp and use whatever vegetables I have on hand (if I don't have mushrooms). I skip the oven and just let it simmer covered in a large skillet for 30 minutes and it is FANTASTIC! Thank you for such a delicious recipe!",
