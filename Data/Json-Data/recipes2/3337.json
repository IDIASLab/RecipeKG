After trying recipe after recipe that turned out either rock hard or thick gummy hard shells - I thought to read the ingredient list on a bottle of the store stuff and came up with this! You can use any oil that has NO flavor or has a flavor compatible with chocolate and your ice cream - canola or soybean work ok here, but the coconut oil sends the flavor over the top and makes it a tad crunchier! Drizzle on top of your favorite ice cream!",

I made 1/4 of the recipe or about 4 servings. So, the full recipe is about half the servings suggested. That amount was equivalent to 1/2 cup choc chips and 2 Tblsp + 1 1/2 tsp of coconut oil. I used Ghiradelli mini choc chips, from the freezer, and it took 1 minute to melt stirring half way through. I tried it on top of Edys 1/2 the fat vanilla bean ice cream. It set up very quickly. It doesnt crack, but it does solidify. I cant imagine why anyone would buy the stuff in a bottle with the ease and taste of this. Edit Note: I didn't store it at room temperature as suggested. I put it in the fridge. To re-melt it, I put it back in the microwave for 1 minute stirring half way through. As it wasn't as warm as when just made it did actually crack into a few pieces, after it set for a minute or so, if that is desired.",
