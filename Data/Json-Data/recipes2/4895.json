I doubled the recipe for a party tomorrow and had about 65 cookies, so the proportions work well.  I added a few drops of almond rather than vanilla out of personal preference.  The dough seemed too dry and I added the white of one egg, and that was MY mistake.  It made the cookies easier to form, but they were too soft in the oven and spread a little.  One suggestion:  I used grape, apricot and strawberry jellies for color and taste difference, but the strawberry was almost too chunky.  A smoother jelly works better.  I will make these again many many times.",
