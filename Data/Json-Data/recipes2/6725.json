        "description": "This is a super-easy way to cook these vegetables if you've never tried them before and by far my favorite. Jerusalem artichokes, or sunchokes, are starchy tubers like potatoes and turnips. When roasted, the skin becomes flaky and the flesh becomes tender, but the taste of a sunchoke is slightly nutty and sweet. Cooked sunchokes are best when eaten within 2 days. When raw, they store well in your fridge's vegetable bin, wrapped loosely in a paper towel. Enjoy!",

Well this recipe is simple and delicious!  You do not need 3/4c of oil. I probably used the equivalent of 2 -3 tbsp and I can't imagine using any more. Great flavor and perfectly cooked after 35 mins. I'll be making it a point to buy these more often!",

However, too much olive oil called for here. They really only get coated and a couple of tablespoons will do that. They also took more like an hour and a bit. We used fresh thyme because we had it.  I will do this again but not that much EVOO.  3 stars for the idea but sorry, the measurements and time were very off in my opinion.",

This recipe was very simple and the results were yummy! My only modification was to spray the sunchoke slices with olive oil (using my misto) and toss with the herbs since we're trying to eat healthier. Can't say I missed the extra oil so I will continue to make the sunchokes this way and will definitely experiment with different herbs in the future (garlic and rosemary are next)!
