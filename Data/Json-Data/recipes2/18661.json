I was confused by the ingredient \"steak seasoning\" I used a dry steak seasoning similar to Montreal steak seasoning. I think whatever you use, dry or wet it will work just fine. I have now made this marinade about 5 times on different types of steaks, it is ALWAYS VERY GOOD. We like the fact that it enhances the steaks without overpowering the natural yummy flavor. This is an awesome exact as is recipe! DO TRY!",

I can't believe I'm saying this, because I'm a real purist when it comes to my steaks, but I'd actually make this again.",

I just rubbed them with Montreal Steak  Seasoning and let them sit for about an hour, that is until they reached room temperature. On they go to the charcoal fired BBQ at HIGH heat. On for three minutes, and rotate 90 degrees, for another three minutes (rotating is done to get the perfect criss-cross grill marking,) then flip for four minutes, rotate 90 degrees again and finish cooking a final four minutes. The total elapsed time on the grill is fourteen minutes! Once you have done it this way, ordering steak in a restaurant or even a steak house will be a disappointment. Serve with baked potato, asparagus red wine and a green salad.",
