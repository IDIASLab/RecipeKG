It worked great! They are best after they have had a chance to chill. We have tried pretty much all of the jello flavors with this recipe. We love grape cherry and orange. I am going to make these for our July 4th party and use cherry berry blue and grape jello. The grape jello appears white on the grapes...so I wlll have something red white and blue! The kids can do this all by themselves too...from start to finish! YUMMY...and healthy snack!",
