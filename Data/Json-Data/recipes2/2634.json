The ingredients are few and inexpensive, and might be made year-round, but I reserve this one special appetizer for the holidays only to maintain its specialness. I love to serve Ritz crackers with the cheese ball to bring out its savory flavor.",

It tasted great on its own but I have also tried adding extra sharp cheddar cheese for some extra flavour and this was just as delicious. It gave it some extra flavour making the taste of the cream cheese a little fainter (although don't get me wrong I love cream cheese). All in all I loved this recipe (as is)!!! Will be making MANY times again. It's now a favourite for parties.",
