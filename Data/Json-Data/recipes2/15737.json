All I have to say is... How in the world did y'all keep your cheese from forming a huge clump? As soon as I added it it locked onto the ginger basil & garlic & it all formed one big gooey clump in a pool of melted butter.:o( I whisked & whisked but never got it anywhere near \"well-blended\". I used fresh parmesan grated fine in my food processor so it was very similiar in texture to the stuff in the can...maybe that was the problem. I liked the flavor combo so I'll try it another time but I'll just grate the cheese on top of the sauce after plating.",
