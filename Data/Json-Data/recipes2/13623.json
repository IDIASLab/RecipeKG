I used apricot preserves instead of chutney (what I had on hand) omitted the pepper since I didn't have any and substituted cucumber for celery (don't like celery). I also used regular salt added more curry powder for flavor and some cayenne pepper for spice. I also added chopped cashews because the flavors blend well (and I didn't have any pine nuts). Definitely marinate overnight- it makes a difference and marries the flavors well. Thanks!",
