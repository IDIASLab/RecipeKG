Couldn't really taste the banana either so I would say either use a very ripe banana or throw in an extra. Think it'd taste better served with something else like fruit. Will try playing around with the proportions next time but all in all great way to use up extra tofu!",

I used frozen banana and milk with some vanilla but otherwise I stayed with the recipe. It thickened up really well. I served it to my 2 & 4 year old's at lunch with some blueberries and a dollop of whipped cream. They loved it. It does have just a little bit of a powdery aftertaste. I think this comes from having so much confectioner's sugar and cocoa powder. I will definitely keep this one and play with the proportions. I think I might try some simple syrup instead of the powdered sugar. I might also try some melted dark chocolate to replace some of the cocoa powder. But this is an awesome base recipe to jump all over from.",
