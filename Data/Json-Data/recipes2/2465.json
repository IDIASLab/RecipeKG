The real star of the show is the strange, but effective, technique of coating the wings with a baking powder-laced spice rub before baking. Through the magic of chemical reactions, the surface of the chicken becomes bone-dry, and eventually crisps up to something very similar to what would come out of a deep fryer.",

I saw Chef John's video on 1/30/15 and was a little leery, but Chef John's never let me down before.  I tried it on Super Bowl Sunday 2015 and it was amazing! So help me, you will not believe the wings have NOT been deep fried no matter what sauce you use.  The outside is crispy and the inside is perfectly tender.  You must try these, you will not be sorry.  One thing though, be sure your baking powder has no aluminum in it or you'll get an aluminum taste.  I used Frank's Wing Sauce and butter not the glaze in Chef John's recipe.  Delicious, delicious and quite easy!  Thank again, Chef John.",

Who knew baking powder would help that?  I was worried I would find a bitter aftertaste but nope, just crispy tasting wings.  The sauce is delicious but I would add a bit more vinegar next time as there was plenty of heat from the Sriracha but the honey needed more bite to cut the sweetness a little.  Perhaps even some lemon juice or lime, would do the trick?  Will definitely be making these again.",

I used a full tablespoon of kosher salt and it was not too salty.  Wonder if the folks complaining that it was too salty used regular table salt instead of kosher.  Table salt grains are smaller and denser than kosher salt grains; therefore you should use half the amount of table salt in a recipe that calls for kosher salt.  Oh and be sure to use non-aluminum baking powder (Ex: Rumford or Bob's Red Mill brand) so they won't have a bitter bite.  If you love sriracha sauce, you're gonna love this! Thanks Chef!",

I took them out of the oven because I didn\u2019t want dried out/overcooked chicken.   Would recommend that you watch your time, as they would have been totally overcooked at the 55 minutes total cooking time at 425\u00baF (that\u2019s pretty hot) indicated in the recipe  They turned out absolutely crispy good, loved them.  If you are  a bit on the shy side as far as heat goes, would suggest you add half the Sriracha to the glaze, taste, and then add more if you like, as these were a bit on the spicy side.  This baking powder rub works so very well to get a crispy baked chicken wing, regardless of how you decide to dress them, Sriracha glaze or traditional buffalo sauce.",
