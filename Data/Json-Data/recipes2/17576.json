What I like to do is instead of cooking on the stove I layer the potatoes in my crockpot then saute the celery with the onion and some fresh minced garlic in a little butter before adding it to the crockpot with the chives and some fresh ground pepper. Instead of using chicken bouillion (which for some reason I rarely have on hand) I cover the ingredients with organic chicken broth. I cook that on HIGH most of the day then mash with an old fashioned potato masher then adding the corn. This recipe is very versatile as you can add in your favorites if you like like shredded cheese crumbled bacon or more sauteed vegetables or eat it as is. Great \"until payday\" lunch or dinner food as it costs so little to make.",
