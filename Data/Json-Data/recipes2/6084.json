When used overnight, the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic make flank, skirt and sirloin steaks flavorful and, most importantly, tender for the grill! For more flavor, add Kosher salt and cracked black pepper to your steak while it cooks. Red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar may be substituted for the red wine.",

Grrrrrrr  So I searched for a simple marinade recipe and decided to try yours.  My husband reported a marked difference in the steak and announced how good it was.  I had never marinaded steak before (too lazy) but will use your recipe again in the future. Oh  Thanks to your Dad, also.  Margene",
