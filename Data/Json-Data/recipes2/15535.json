I also cubed the tofu into smaller bite size bites and squezzed lemon juice on top when they were done cooking along with some kosher salt and the green onions. My kids (3 & 5) loved it they thought it was cheese though and i didn't correct them! It was good I think i would add some seasoning directly to the tofu next time before i dredge it in the cornstarch just for a little more flavor! I am not afraid of tofu any more.",
