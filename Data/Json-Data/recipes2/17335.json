Couldn't help but put my own spin on this by dredging the chops in flour before browning them, adding fresh sage and minced garlic as well as the rosemary, and using white wine rather than red. Also, not wanting to make a trip to the grocery store for one portobello mushroom, I substituted dried porcini mushrooms. I served this with \"Risotto alla Milanese,\" also from this site. Simply memorable!",

I feel that this recipe works perfectly for veal and maybe pork chops but NOT on any form of steak. The rosemary gives the veal/sauce a nice woody/earthy flavor that could only be pulled off on veal or pork. The flavor would be lost to a steak or red meat of any kind. We served it with garlic herb potato wedges and my husband was in heaven!!!!",

I dip the chops in flour that I zipped up with salt, pepper,  & garlic powder.  As I browned the chops ( in a out 3tbl butter & oil) I added scallions, onions, mushrooms, fresh Rosemary, black pepper & dried sage.  Added white cooking wine & chicken broth.  I also added 3 to 4 cloves of smashed garlic for flavor.  Put in the oven at 350 for about 35 minutes in my Dutch oven pan and served with couscous.  Amazing dish with gourmet flavors.",
