The amount of soy sauce is outrageous and there is no need to \"marinate\" in it for 2 hours. It tasted like soy sauce and nothing more. The flavor of the fish, fruit and veggies were completely over powered. I wish I had thought about this a bit before diving in. Hopefully this review will save the rest of you the sadness of ruining a beautiful piece of fish.",
