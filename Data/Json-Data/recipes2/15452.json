I've also used ground turkey instead of the ground beef or thrown in some crumbled browned italian sausage with the ground beef. Use a 14 ounce jar of pizza sauce instead of the spaghetti sauce (Ragu quick sauce is great). Mix the brown ground meat with the sauce and one beaten egg (save 1 Tbs of the egg). I place the meat mixture in the dish and layer the cheeses over it. Roll the crescent rolls out to completely cover the ingredients and brush the Tbs. of egg over the dough to get a golden crust.",
