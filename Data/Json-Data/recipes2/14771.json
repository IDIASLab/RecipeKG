No children in our household but the adults liked it too! I found that the batter wasn't enough for 6 pieces of the bread I used. I added another egg and some milk towards the end because I ran out. However it could have been the excessively large pieces of bread I was using. Also I didn't use white bread. I used a 7 grain bread. We don't eat white bread in our family, but it was fabulous. Served it up with a side of bacon. w00",

This recipe is the closest to what I had there with one exception - I use the thick cut bread like they do in Jamaica.  The bread gets less soggy and is easier to handle. This recipe is perfect in that there is no sugar added and only uses a few ingredients.  I through everything in the blender and use a shallow dish for the bread.  I've even mastered flipping the toast so I don't need any utensils.",
