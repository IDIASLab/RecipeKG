I had some great Puerto Rican rum that was a gift to use in these Caneles.  The only thing I would do differently is bake for 5 minutes or so at the 450 degrees.  I had two pans of these (one was the fluted muffin type pan) and one regular muffin pan that made it into the oven about 5 minutes after the first pan and they turned out perfect.  The others were a little too browned after 40 minutes.  It may have been the differences in the pans since the fluted pan is a bit darker. In both pans the Caneles have a nice custard in the center.  ( I had to eat one from each pan to be sure;)  Thanks for a new treat to make, Chef John!",

I was overly generous with greasing the tin with the beeswax/butter mixture, which resulted in a soft bottom which was okay, but not as crispy as it should have been. The sides were nice and crispy. Made it again (same day) using a muffin tin instead of the popover tin. \nMade them with a friend to demonstrate how easy they are to make. We were very happy with the result using the muffin tin. Version 3: bought a fluted muffin tin, still making half the recipe, and am very happy with the presentation. Note: it seems that beeswax has a higher melting point than butter, hence the need to melt them together on top of the stove. (Microwave does not work as the butter starts to spit while the little beads of wax are still solid).",

Be careful not to use too much butter-wax grease on the tin, or you will get a weird wax texture in the end.  If your tin is cold when you brush on the grease, it is easy to put on too much.  Try leaving the pan in the pre-heating oven for a minute to warm up, and then inspect the brushed on wax after the pan cools before adding the batter.  Reapply if necessary.  \n\nEven if you put on a lot, or they get a little charred, they're still delicious.",
