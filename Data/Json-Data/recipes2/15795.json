We have a nut allergy in the family so I tried to think of a substitute and decided on cherries. I drained and finely chopped a 6 oz jar of marischino cherries. I then discovered I only had 1/4 cup of rum so I added 1/4 cup of the maraschino juice to bring the liquid up to 1/2 cup. My rum balls came out quite nice someone even asked me for the recipe. 1/2 cup of rum would make them very strong because they are pretty potent with only 1/4 cup!",

To switch it up a little, I roll these in coconut, icing sugar, cocoa, or those holiday sprinkles.  I put 4-8 inside a plastic baggie, tie it with some ribbon and voil\u00e0!\n",

However I wasn't completely prepared to make them because of which I had no vanilla wafers at home!So I used about 12 oreos crushed instead. And since I didn't have any corn syrup at home I used honey instead but there was no significant flavour difference. I used 1/2 cup of white rum (since I didn't have any dark rum at home).But for those who like their rum balls strong but not really really strong I'd suggest using ONLY 1/4 cup of rum. Once the entire mixture was ready I poured it into a bowl and left it in the freezer for about 3 hours to set and harden well. I rolled them in confectioners sugar and some in crushed mixed nuts. I liked the crushed mixed nuts topping better since I hadn't added any nuts into the cookie balls while making them! I guess I made a lot of changes but I couldn't help it I had to make them and didn't have the right supplies! Thanks for the recipe!",

What I did not have the wit to realize is that for these you really must replace the missing liquid somehow -- perhaps simply with water or maybe more melted chocolate would work. (Although I had added 2 t. of vanilla since I was using the unflavored cookies that are the closest vanilla-wafer substitute in my country of residence.) Without the extra 1/4 c. of rum the flavor of these was good but the texture was crumbly and difficult to form into balls. Not that my coworkers really minded.",
