We are huge curry fans so a few things I did differently -- doubled the broth and the coconut milk and also sauteed the spices in oil about 5 min into cooking the onion. The hot oil not only brings out the flavor in the spices more strongly but also becomes infused with them. While I love vegetarian curries my family needed some meat so I added chicken. I added the chicken in with the onions about 10 min into the saute. They finished cooking during simmering time. Everything was fantastic and the family has this packed for lunch tomorrow.
