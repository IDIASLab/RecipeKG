I just did it the way my Mom and Grandma taught me and never would have thought to lightly fry and place it in the oven. Since I love french toast I had to give this a try and I was pleasantly surprised. This came out crisp, light, fluffy and just plain delicious. I topped it with a dusting of powdered sugar and  REAL maple syrup. It was perfect served with fresh fruit and OJ! Thanks for a great recipe Chef John and an update on a truly classic breakfast favorite!",

The cinnamon and all spice give a nice flavor. I added a very small amount of powered sugar to the mixture. It was nice to put the slices in the oven as they were fried and also kept them nice and hot until all were complete so we could sit down and enjoy together.
