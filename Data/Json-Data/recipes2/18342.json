I made this for my hubby's birthday instead of a cake since he isn't a cake eater but loves cheesecake, pudding and parfaits. I used 2% milk and chocolate pudding mix since he doesn't like coconut either. This was really simple to prepare and just took a bit of time is all. Could be done with any flavor of pudding. This makes a huge pan and could serve 12 easily. Thanks for sharing this delightful dessert recipe.",
