Agree with other reviewers that these took some time to prep -- almost 1.5 hours for me. Next time I would definitely just bite the bullet and buy the pistachios that are already out of the shell that would have saved considerable time (but more ). If you are a fairly experienced baker these are fairly easy to put together. I'm pretty sure that the key to avoiding crumbly dough is not over-mixing the dough when adding the flour. I mixed until just combined chilled for 4 hours and then sliced with a large serrated bread knife. A few cookies needed to be stuck back together but for the most part they sliced nicely and looked pretty nice when all was said and done! My cookies took about 18-20 minutes to cook (recipe calls for 13-15 minutes).",

They do have a good taste but the pistachio and cranberry taste is missing. They take a good deal of prep time so I'm pretty sure I won't be making these again. I put two on a plate for my husband to eat after dinner and I just saw that he left one. He never leaves sweets so he must not have cared for them either.",
