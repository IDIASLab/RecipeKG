It is a different type of pasta, having a great deal of flavour from the roasted pepper and sun-dried tomato, as well as being slightly dry from the cheese. I'm a picky eater and I love this dish!",

I didn't have goat cheese so I used mozzarella and it's way to cold and windy to grill so i used egg italian bread crumbs and fried the chicken in olive oil. I also used pre-marinated sun dried tomato's. This did make it a lot simpler. Next time I will make sure to grill the chicken and have goat cheese.",

I roasted my own red and orange peppers on the grill (you basically blacken them put them in a bowl covered in plastic wrap for about 20 mins then slide off the blackened parts. Voila! Roasted peppers) and used about 2 total. I used the sundried tomatoes in oil and processed in the food processor--so much easier that way! I don't have fresh basil so I used dried and marinated overnight then tossed the pasta and cooked with some frozen chicken tenderloins for about 20 minutes-was delicious and great with some bread. I left out the cheese and we didn't notice. Thanks for the recipe!",
