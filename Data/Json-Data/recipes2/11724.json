I didn\u2019t have coconut flour so used white flour instead, and I was out of cocoa so I omitted it and compensated with a dash more Nutella. Also, I used milk instead of almond milk, and took the advice of another reviewer by adding a bit more milk to avoid dryness (1/2 Tbs). Even with all the substitutions this turned out fudgey, moist and delicious. My only suggestion is to make sure you mix everything very well, as I failed to do so and there was a bit at the bottom that didn\u2019t cook properly.",
