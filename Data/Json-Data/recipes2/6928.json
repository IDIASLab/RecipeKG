The ground turkey I used was a little on the wet / finely ground side and because of that my burger patties wanted to fall apart; but they tasted very good; I loved the caramelized onion and melted cheese on top and the garlic flavor of the turkey burger. I caramelized my onions for about 15 - 20 minutes to get them good and browned and tender but other than that followed the recipe exactly. Thanks!!",

The only other change I made was to add a little himalayan salt and fresh ground black pepper. I didn't need to add any breadcrumbs. I just \"dumped\" the ground turkey and black bean mixture into a cast iron skillet with some olive oil and used a spoon to form a patty shape. I served it on a bed of lettuce and topped it with the sauteed onions. It was really good! I'll make these again but might spice them up a little more! Edit - 6/28/17 - this time I was using a full pound of organic ground turkey. I used a full can of organic black beans rinsed and drained and mashed slightly with a potato masher. I didn't have any salsa so I substituted some organic jalapeno sauce cumin dried cilantro and chili powder (a few shakes of each). I again added some himalayan salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste. This time I decided to add a little diced onion to the mixture so the onion taste will be in the burger as well as on the top. I formed the patties on top of some waxed paper and popped them in the freezer on a tray. Am looking forward to just popping one out of the freezer on nights where I need a quick tasty and healthy meal!",
