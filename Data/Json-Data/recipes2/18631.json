They love taking turns toasting their own garlic bread in the toaster oven....and adding their own special\ningredients....we fix garlic seasoning in butter with onion flakes, parsley flakes, garlic flakes, and organio. Spreading with different cheeses each one has their own little bowl. And to cut down on clean up we use clean bathroom drinking cups or styrofoam coffee cups. They LOVE it. Its a SPECIAL treat at MAW MAW's HOUSE. Grandmothers take time to make memories with your grandchildren...It may not be top notch but who care with grandchildren around....they come first.",

I use garlic bread sprinkle instead of garlic powder and also sprinkle a little italian seasoning or oregano on top and parmesan cheese. The parmesan takes on a wonderful flavor when it gets toasted.
