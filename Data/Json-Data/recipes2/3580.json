I've started adding a little graded cheddar cheese to it when it has 5 minutes left to go in the oven- try it! I think it's important to add, it always takes me more than 10 min to prepare!! (But I do cut mine into strips too.) Give yourself at least 15-20 min before it goes in the oven. For a side dish, I like steamed broccoli, rice, and I make a cheese sauce. Take the rest of the soup, add milk and cheddar cheese, heat it up and drizzle it over the rice and broccoli!  ~Jessica~",
