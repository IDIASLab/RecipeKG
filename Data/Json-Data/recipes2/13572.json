I was amazed at how the kids gobbled it up on crackers too. It makes a large batch so we had plenty of leftovers which were great for sandwiches the next day on sourdough bread. When I make it again I'll cut the recipe in half. Great recipe!",

This one was a huge hit among the liverwurst lovers in the crowd and even a few brave souls who tried it for the first time. The thing I liked best about this recipe was that while I had to add things to the outsides of the other cheese balls at the last minute this one was already done and ready to plate. I only made two minor changes: 1) I used Mother Goose liverwurst (found in the deli section of the supermarket) instead of the Braunschweiger and 2) I studded the outside of the balls (this recipe made two larger-sized balls by the way) with a mixture of green and black sliced olives instead of just the green ones the recipe called for. Made for a \"funky\" presentation that people commented on positively. Thank you for this creative recipe!",
