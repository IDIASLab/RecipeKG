I found uncooked Johnsonville sausage patties in my store so I just cooked them up prior to assembling. They were the perfect size for the muffin tins. The biscuit recipe I used was the Basic Biscuit recipe on this site. I rolled the dough a little thinner and cut with a 4 oz. juice glass which fit the muffin tin perfectly. If you choose to cook your own sausage from bulk the 4 oz. juice glass will work good for cutting them to size as well. I loved being able to just layer these in the muffin tins and bake. Tasty little gems!",

A couple of things to note... the Johnsonville original recipe breakfast sausage that I found in the shape of patties in my store were NOT fully cooked (and it was a 12oz. package) so I cooked these as directed on the package prior to assembling with the biscuits. The Pillsbury Grands biscuits I used were a 16.3oz container not 12oz as the recipe states (I couldn't find any variety of Grands in my grocery store that was 12oz). Both of these alternate sizes worked fine with the recipe. I am going to freeze some of these to have on-hand for kids' breakfasts on school days.",
