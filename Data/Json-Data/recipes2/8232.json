The secret really is in grinding the ingredients together until they release those juices that put this guac over the top, so make sure you take the extra effort to follow the technique as closely as possible. I suggest watching the video. I have made plenty of these recipes over the years (as I'm sure many of you have as well) but never have I achieved results like this.",
