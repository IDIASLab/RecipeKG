The sweetness of the strawberry melds incredibly well with the bite of the blue cheese (try LaVergne very smooth blue). Once you try this salad you'll wonder why you didn't have this before. Also try different fruits like apples pears grapes pineapple etc. I'm glad you decided to share this recipe with others. Thanks.",

The left overs were snatched up before I could get some!! Thank you!!!!",
