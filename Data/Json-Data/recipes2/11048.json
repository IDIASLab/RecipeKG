I'd recommend that you use a really good brand of coconut water to mimic that pina colada flavor. I used Iberia Coconut Water with coconut pulp blended with ice and added some toasted coconut and chopped pineapple for the garnish.",

I also did not wait the 30 minutes for the chia seeds to thicken (can't they do that in my tummy?) and apparently turn browner. And finally even though the coconut water and pineapple had been in the frig the drink was not cold enough for me so I drank it over ice. Since I didn't let the chia seeds expand this is like drinking a flavored not very sweet water.",

I would prefer to slightly blend them to get little pieces here and there. I added some ice to give more body to the drink but it didn't help much. The color is not the most appealing but the chia seeds are to blame for that and the texture. Would I make it again? Yes making the changes I suggested.",
