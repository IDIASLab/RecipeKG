Yes they are hard to cut once completely chilled, so my foil pan ended up with little holes in the bottom but this had no effect on the awesome taste and richness of these bars. Great dessert if it\u2019s too hot to bake. I will be making these for future gatherings for sure.",

I used green paste colouring for the liquid reduced the butter in the topping to 2 tbsps from 1/4 cup and topped up the cup of chips for the topping with semi sweet as I did not have enough. I do not refrigerate the bars after I add the topping as I find them too hard to cut I put them in a Tupperware container overnight then cut for nicer edges. #Allrecipesallstarscanada #Christmasbaking #FacelessNoMore",
