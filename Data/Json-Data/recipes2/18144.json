I improvised a little by rubbing the chicken breasts with extra virgin olive oil salt and pepper and tossing some garlic cloves into the pan as well. I served this on top of mini penne and it was very very filling. I think the flavor of the dish will depend mostly on the spaghetti sauce you choose. (I used a spicy pepper-flavored sauce and hubby asked that I tone it down next time.) I will probably make this again because it's so easy and the ingredients are minimal and convenient.
