You can use your imagination with additions such as fresh fruit, preserves, or even chopped nuts. I have made this with flavored yogurt, but I prefer plain. You can even use the yogurt fluid (whey) instead of water in baking recipes.",

The cone shape helps strain the whey easier,and the fact they are reusable is more economical in the long run. I buy whole milk yogurt...and love the results. When I give it to my grandkids,I add a spoonful of strawberry or blueberry preserves in it.. along with chopped fresh fruit.",
