Also after the water is boiling add the crawfish and boil for only 7 minutes. When done remove from water and put into a large sealable container so they can steam out. A good idea is to sprinkle with tony's seasoning or powered crab boil before closing up. Allow to sit for about 15 minutes then eat. One other thing if you only have 10 pounds of crawfish you better be eating alone.",
