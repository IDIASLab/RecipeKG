With that being said, I'd still reduce it to 1/4 cup if I were to make this again. This was in desperate need of more then just salt and pepper and needed herbs. I ended up adding Cavenders and parsley but it still lacked. Cook time was way off too. 3 hours was plenty and anything over 4 would have been mush. It needed more water than called for and broth would have been a better alternative to add more flavor. Loved the tomato base but this one needs tweaked and I can only give a 3. If you were to add 3 cups of oil, this would be inedible.",
