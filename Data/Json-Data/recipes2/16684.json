My guests devoured this. Next time I'm adding a total of 4 eggs and a bit more flour to see if it gets fluffier. I'd like to try this with homemade roasted chiles even though the canned whole chiles tasted fine but I wouldn't use the diced chiles - discovered they are bitter, have too much juice, seeds, pieces of stem and ??? Yucky. Took longer to cook in the 8x8 pan (10-15 min. longer) and be sure to let it rest at least 10 minutes before serving. This is such a delicious recipe (despite all the changes) it still deserves 5 stars.  *&$^@*&!  I just reread the recipe and discovered it calls for a 5 oz. can (?) of evap milk. Hmmmmm. Maybe that is why so many reviewers eliminated the regular milk and just used a can (12 oz) of evap milk. That's what I did and it turned out fine. Pays to read the fine print!",

Smaller pan (8x8 or 9x9), 2-3 lg. fresh roasted pasillo or ahaheim chiles (peeled & diced), 4 eggs, half the cheeses, only the evap. milk. For the egg mixture: Separate the eggs and whip the whites until slightly stiff. Blend together the egg yolks, flour and milk and fold into the beaten egg whites. This creates a much fluffier casserole. The best sauce for this dish is a can of mexican style stewed tomatoes, blended till just smooth. More authentic and flavorful than using enchilada sauce. Never would use just canned tomato sauce - yuck.\n\nAs an update, since I make this so often, I should add that I often skip the sauce, and top the casserole with thinly sliced tomatoes instead-before baking. For the reviewer that posted that 4 eggs was too many (tasted the eggs), I should note that I typically make this as a breakfast/brunch dish, so maybe that's the difference.",

I use chopped chilis, one more egg, and only the evaporated milk (Not the additonal 1/2 cup milk which isn't even listed in the directions.  #2 says mix milk not milks.  Is the extra milk a typo?).  I also bake it in a smaller pan - not the 8x8 - I use that odd pan in between an 8x8 and 10x13.  We serve it with taco pie (fried burger with tomato sauce, served over a baked crescent roll crust, topped with cheese, and add your own lettuce, onion, etc.)  This is definitely a keeper.

Also, I thought there was too much cheese.  Wow!  That is really saying something for me because I am a cheese lover and usually add more than is called for.  Maybe there wasn't too much, just needed something in there with it.  I think I will try a little shredded chicken in the middle of the chilies next time.  I have never had chile rellenos with meat in them, but hey, sounds like it would be tasty!",
