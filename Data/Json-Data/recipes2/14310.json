It's a pretty standard milkshake recipe so I don't think you can legitimately say that the texture is bad. Before you recommend playing with the amount of milk do keep in mind that \"scoops\" of ice cream is a very arbitrary measurement. Try starting with a 2:1 ratio of ice cream to milk.",

It turned out way too sweet, since there is only 1/2 a cup milk and the rest is sweet. I tested it out in the middle of the blending process and realised it was too rich with sweetness, so I added another 1/2 cup of milk. After that, it was alright. It made more like 3 servings, instead of 2. Overall- I was not impressed. It wasn't the best milkshake I've had but it was average. I also added whipped cream to the top and it was actually pretty tasty with chocolate chip cookies (yum). I don't think I will make this one again, but I will keep looking for the perfect milkshake recipe.",
