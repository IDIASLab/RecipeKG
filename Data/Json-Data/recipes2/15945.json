As per other reviewers I used cream of broccoli soup and cheddar french fried onions. I don't think it matters what kind of cheese you use - I had mont. jack so I used that instead of cheddar. I seasoned the mixture with garlic salt and pepper. Next time I think I'll saute some finely chopped onion in butter and add that for extra flavor. Will definitely be making this again!",

I used steamed fresh veggies (about 4 cups) since I am not a fan of frozen veggies. For additional taste I added about 2 teaspoons dry Hidden Valley Fiesta Dip mix which gave it a bit more flavor. My husband really loved it (and he can sometimes be a bit picky on his vegetables). You could also use any type of veggie dip or sour cream chip dip instead of the sour cream for variation. Thanks for a great recipe!",

All in all it was still very very good and we will certainly make it again either this way or as stated.",

I am always on the look for new recipes with ingredients that I am sure to have around the house. Like some of the other suggestions I used fresh broccoli and cauliflower and steamed them until slightly tender and left out the carrots due to the fact that I'm not very fond of cooked carrots:) I also added some famous essence to give it a bit more kick but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It was delicious and will make again with the possibility of adding something more like rice pasta or makeing it a meat dish..",
