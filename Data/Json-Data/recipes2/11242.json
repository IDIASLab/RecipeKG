We will absolutely have this drink again! Thanks so much!",

Doing so would bruise the vermouth and cause an unpleasant taste. Also one jigger of vermouth would be quite strong. Perhaps just swirl a small bit of vermouth into the glass and pour out the excess then add in the shaken whiskey and honey.",

There is an almost smokey undertaste that I can't explain.This tastes more complex than the ingredients would lead you to believe. Who would think that adding 2 simple ingredients to a classic recipe would make such an impression? Very pretty name too.",
