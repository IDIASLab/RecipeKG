When I pick my daughter up from school we usually have to go through the drive through and get her some.\nI did use a different noodle (soba) and I used 1/2 soy sauce and the other 1/2 teriyaki sauce (as she likes teriyaki sauce better) used probably 1/2 the sriracha sauce  and also added some mushrooms, celery and some onion along with the broccoli, carrots and pepper.\nAfter making these I got two thumbs up from my daughter and I had a hard time stopping eating it (I did put a heavy dose of sriracha sauce on my  serving) and will be definitely making again!\nAlso this is the first time I have made something without lots of reviews and after making I looked to see how many reviews there was and was shocked! I will try other things with not many reviews again for sure.",

I made the following adaptations:\n\n- added an extra tbsp of mirin \n- reduced the ginger to 1/2 tsp \n-  added shitake mushrooms\n- used ready to serve udon noodles (Kame brand)\n- doubled the sauce\n\n\nIt tasted EXACTLY like Noodles & Company!  I do wish I would have added the sauce right after I cooked the meat as it would have thickened more, but all in all it was delicious!",

A really easy protein to add is precooked shrimp that you can toss in with the noodles at the very end just to warm them and coat them in the sauce. Like many other people I doubled the sauce and had to add a little vegetable oil to cook with just because the sesame oil was not enough. I also used 2 servings of the vacuum sealed Myojo udon noodles which made cooking much faster. I will say that the portion size was maybe a little too small for four people so I'll be adding a third serving of noodles next time.",
