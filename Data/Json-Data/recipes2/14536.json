The differences are to omit the bacon-but you can use bacon grease, add diced tomatoes and some garlic while cooking the zucchini, or Mexican squash.  You can also add chopped green chili.  Cover and cook diced zuch and tomatoes with spices, onion and garlic until tender (10-15 mins. Don't over cook). Add corn (I use canned), heat through and top with cheese--cover till melted.  I use cheddar cheese but I'm sure the MJ is very good. Mexican squash looks like zucchini except that it is a light green color.",
