I think the hollandaise and sherry are just the right amounts and give it a great flavor. This would have been 5 stars without changes, but I did add a bit of extra sherry and crabmeat. Those two changes are just personal preference. On top of being a terrific recipe, it was also quite easy to make. Not too many ingredients or steps to follow. I'd make this for dinner party.",

I also added sauteed onions and celery, a little more sherry, and chopped parsley. There are a lot of great additions you could do with this soup - the base is awesome. The  half & half can easily be replaced with milk for a few less fat cals - it's still rich and creamy. The ONLY reason I'm not giving this recipe 5 stars is because of the out-of-control Old Bay called for. I used half and had more than enough. Great recipe anyway, thanks Karyn!",

I make a similar crab soup, but it always seemed to be lacking in flavor.  So the addition of the envelope of hollandaise sauce was brilliant.  I only made some minor adjustments - at the suggestion of other reviewers, I used a tad bit less Old Bay Seasoning.  I also doubled the amount of cooking sherry only because I really enjoy the flavor of sherry in seafood cream-based soups.  Since I was only cooking this for myself, I had some left over, and it was just as wonderful warmed in the microwave the following day, however, I added a small amount of milk to cut down on the thickness from being refrigerated.  Thank you for sharing such a delicious soup!",
