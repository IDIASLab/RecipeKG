My problem is this mixture was NOT shaping into balls. So I laid down parchment paper on a cookie sheet and spread the mixture out flat on that and then placed it in the freezer. I then cut this into 24 squares which must be kept in the freezer. I tried keeping it in the fridge overnight and it became unfirm so I put it back in the freezer. I may make this again but only if my family requests it. I will not make it for myself (I didn't like it enough).",
