First I rolled the bread slices flat with a heavy rolling pin and buttered them and placed them (buttered side down) inside silicon cupcake cases which made them very easy to remove. I got two circles per slice of bread. I cut out the circle shapes with an empty mushroom can but you could use a cookie cutter or even egg rings. I added bacon and parsley though this is a great base recipe to play with...try adding asparagus, mushrooms, bell pepper, chicken, corn, etc etc. Great snacks or to pass around as party finger food.",

I used a biscuit cutter to trim the bread into circles. I sprayed the bottom of the muffin tins with a little Pam and them placed the bread inside. I added an extra egg to the mixture, some chopped Canadian bacon, 1/4 tsp. each of salt, garlic powder, & onion powder, 1/2 cup of chopped green onion instead of regular and substituted American cheese for the Swiss. I would definitely make these again.",
