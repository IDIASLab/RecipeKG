Never would have imagined lamb risotto and artichokes in the same dish would work so well. I thought the vinegar from the 'chokes would clash but they melted in your mouth. It's like porridge except not at all slimy. You can mix the rice and all the liquid in either a rice cooker or pressure cooker and do this without stirring and fussing. Just warm the other ingredients a bit by stirring into the rice the last few minutes and covering pot. I have also tried adding green peas asparagus or olives to the the mix. I have used this recipe as a base with different wines as with other leftover meat or raw defrosted seafood as well and it works. Whatever you alter do not skimp on the best olive oil butter wine shallots and cheese.",

I used 1/3 cup Merlot and it definitely wasnt purple as described. My big chain grocery store did not carry Arborio rice or any short grain for that matter. So ended up using medium grain. There is only 2 of us so used 1 cup rice and 3 cups broth. I used hot marinated artichokes for extra flavor and it came out great. I was worried about under cooking the rice but turned out slightly overcooked by the end. For the med grain next time I would use maybe 2 3/4 cups broth instead.",

SECOND REVIEW: Okay so I made it again 1c of red instead of 1/2 cup needed to add more liquid than called for and FINALLY got to add cheese:O) STILL spectcaular we have fantastic left over lamb (pasture raised organic leg of lamb OMG amazing). Honestly the cheese was great but we could have left it out. Also used both times leeks instead of shallots. Used red wine not white and don't care about the color as soon as it hits your tongue:O) Pairs wonderfully with a Blanc de Noir sparkling wine. TRY THIS RECIPE!!!",
