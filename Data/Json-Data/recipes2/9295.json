I replaced it with King Arthur's\u00ae AP flour.  The taste is delicious and I loved the burst of tartness from the cranberries.  I'm sure mine netted a heavier pancake because of my flour choice, but the overall taste was delicious.  Thanks Megan, for sharing your recipe.",

My only change was to have dried cranberries instead of frozen and i soaked them overnight. I think when using sorghum or other non gluten flours you have to whip the egg whites and add xanthan gum and apple cider vinegar to make it palitable! Also should vary the sorghum with another gluten free flour such as rice or corn or millet.",
