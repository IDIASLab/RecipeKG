I am not a fan of anything licorice flavor but boy did this taste really good! I wish I made more broth to soak up with my french bread! This was a big hit with my friends. It did turn out a bit salty but we have a very high tolerance for salt so this was just right! Would absolutely make this again and again!",

This was super easy and tasted as good as steamed clams at any restaurant (although I didn't use the fennel because I forgot it). There was plenty of broth for dipping the garlic bread that we made to go with it. Going back to Costco for more clams today!",
