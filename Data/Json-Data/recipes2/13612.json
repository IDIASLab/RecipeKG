We had this in pita pockets with Romaine lettuce and really enjoyed it--but I know we wouldn't have if I had used all the lemon and lime juice this recipe calls for!",

I didn't measure how much I added of each just tried to keep it at lemon:lime 2:1 ratio in the original recipe and didn't add enough for it to get soupy. I also added some crumbled feta cheese and some halved grape tomatoes. I scaled it to feed 4 and then served it as a side dish for 5 people we ate it all. I served it with Hawaiian sweet rolls and pita bread. I liked it best on the hawaiian rolls but it was good on the pita too.",
