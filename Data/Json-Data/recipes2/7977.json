I split the mixture between 4 bowls. This gets REALLY thick. I ended up having to add an extra 2-3tbsp milk to each bowl. Next time I will use about half the amount of chia seed. You really don't need that much chia for it to thicken the pudding. I also ended up adding a bit more honey than stated (personal preference).  I topped it with a few raspberries. I was able to eat this after 20mins or so. It didn't need an hour to set. Makes a great breakfast or nighttime snack. Thank you completenovice!",

I portioned out into 4 bowls and topped with slivered almonds, chocolate chips, and sweetened coconut.  This was my first time working with chia seeds, really interesting and delicious.",

It was seriously thick and had to add about a quarter cup of extra liquid to get it to a pudding consistency which I added after the one-hour rest period. It keeps in the fridge well making it an excellent candidate for a party dessert that won t bust your buckle or budget. Thank you for the recipe.",
