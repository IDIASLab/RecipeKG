I mixed half of the pepper mixture with the mayo mixture. Then reserved the other half of the pepper mix in the fridge. Later in the week I used it blended with some melted butter to have as topping for crab cakes. This was incredibly yummy both ways, with the mayo mix AND with the melted butter! It's also simple enough to make it to your liking... add more or less jalapeno, depending on how spicy you want it. Also, some of the reviewers thought the mayo was too heavy. If you feel that way, just add a few more splashes of vinegar. Overall, a great recipe that is versatile and extremely tasty. Well worthy of 5 stars!",
