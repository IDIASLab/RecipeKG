We used peeled cubed sweet potatoes instead of red because it's what we had on hand and we prefer them to white flesh potatoes. Total simmer time went up to an hour but it was totally worth it. The sweet and the spice flavors together were SO good. I would highly recommend starting off by cooking all the spices in the oil first then adding the onions tomatoes ect. Then it's a proper gravy. Oh so good and tastes even better the next night!",
