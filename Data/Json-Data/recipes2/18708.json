By finishing them in the beer sauce they just get better and better. Though it's expensive, on special occasions I use a dark beer which is not German at all: Guinness Irish Stout. Around our house, we eat them with ketchup and mustard, and the cooked onions from the brat sauce.",

Although I now live in Lancaster, PA, I still only GRILL my brats, often serve them soaked in beer and ALWAYS insist that they are served on hard rolls. Everyone who has tried them loves them.\n\nA couple of additional comments: If they are available in your area, choose only JOHNSONVILLE Brats... a product of Johnsonville in Sheboygan County, Wisconsin. Every serious brat connoisseur knows that no other brand compares. :)  \n\nAlso, a slow cooker or crock pot works great for keeping the brats warm until serving time. When the brats come of the grill, throw them into the slow cooker beer and onion bath until the rest of the food is ready. Enjoy!",

Our family has always done a low and slow simmer in beer and onions first - usually whatever is on hand mixed with at least one bottle of a Leinenkugel dark then grill and then toss them back in the beer bath if we are cooking a lot of them. The bun is crucial - a Sheboygan Hard Roll is the ONLY way to eat these - and generously buttered! A good stone ground mustard - NEVER ketchup and Johnsonville Meisfelds or Sheboygan Bratwurst Company (they will ship brats AND hardrolls across the US) are the top three. Cold beer and potato salad Milwaukee Dill's and a Packer game will make it even more authentic:)",

A brat always has a companion in a semmel roll; hard roll made in Sheboygan and still made locally. I no longer eat brats (too high in cholesterol and family history of colon cancer) but my family enjoys them all year long-grilled outdoors even in a snowstorm. We have many wonderful brat makers in Sheboygan county but one of the finer ones is Miesfeld's-has recieved many awards. Johnsonville is for out-of-towners-really don't know what a GOOD brat is. Always add beer and sliced onions to the cooked brats. ENJOY!",

Put the brats in with this mixture and then put the pan on the grill indirect heat covered with foil. Kept the grill at no more than 300' and the brats stayed great for hours! Just increase the amount of onions beer and stock based on how many brats you need. Call this our \"brat tub\" and it is asked for at every family outing! Serve it with good cole slaw and great rolls and it's a meal fit for a royal family!!",
