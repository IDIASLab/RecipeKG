I'm a little concerned by some comments  calling the preparation intimidating or a lot of work. It's not, but unfortunately this might dissuade others from trying it. I used butter rather than oil, all shrimp, clam juice for the fish stock, and no cayenne (hubby has sensitive innards). Even without the cayenne, it was still too hot for hubby, so he was unable to eat it. So just a warning--this is hot and spicy. If you're not sure about the level of heat, add less hot sauce to start--you can always add more, but can't take it away once it's in there! Oh--throw in a little chopped fresh parsley or green onion just before serving...the little punch of color really is pretty and brightens it up.",

Almost everything in LA starts with a roux, and the end result is well worth it!  Don't be afraid to try - all you have to do is stir constantly (I use a whisk) for 15 minutes, and the scary part is over.  If you don't have crawfish, use all shrimp.  Throw in some cooked chicken if you want...it is soooo good.  FYI - I didn't use cayenne or hot sauce, but put in 2T of Old Bay.  Perfect every time!!",

I used boxed fish stock and it was amazing, I added some frozen crawfish meat and shrimp and the frozen crawfish meat ruined it.  I was sooo disappointed.  The second time I made this, I used clam juice with some fish sauce (used in oriental cooking) and omitted the crawfish meat (since it is hard to get fresh stuff where I live) and added diced chicken and it was again amazing.  I usually like to play with the recipe a little but there is no need to with this one.  It has become a new family favorite and I actually enjoy making the roux.",

The vegetables and seasonings in this recipe fit the bill perfectly-- I used a vegetarian \"chicken-style\" broth instead of fish stock and added 8 oz. diced tempeh (instead of the crawfish and shrimp) when it was time to add the tomatoes and the stock.  I followed everything else exactly as written.  We love hot and spicy recipes and my husband has greedily devoured this the two times I've made it so far.  Even with the time it takes to make the roux, the ingredients are quickly prepared and this recipe is really quite simple to make.

So if you don't like your food too hot you may want to cut back and use a little less cayenne pepper black pepper and hot sauce. Some recipes call for \"corn starch.\" But I found the roux is much better - more flavorful. Roux can be tricky - take your time don't set the heat/fire too high (you definitely don't want it to burn). Roux is worth the work. Also I had never heard of \"fish stock (soup).\" But I found it at an Asian store named Seafood City. I found it in boullion cubes brand named \"Knorr.\" Surprisingly they had fish flavor and shrimp flavor. I think the fish stock along with the roux really added to the flavor. I did not use the shrimp - I used all crawfish. Shrimp and crawfish each have there own flavor. I'll make the next batch with the shrimp. Try it. It's delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!!!",

                "reviewBody": "Okay but the recipe needs some changes.  The roux calls for too much oil.  I'd use 1/4 cup next time.  As is, you can really taste the oil and it covers your lips while eating.  The roux should have been browner, not quite the right taste at peanut butter color.  I'd go for about 30 minutes and shoot for a milk chocolate color.  Also, the vegetables need to saute for at least twice as long.  I followed the cooking times in the recipe and they came out crunchy.  I'm glad I cooked it for the family first before making it for guests or I would have been a tad embarrassed.  This recipe made four servings, not near enough to stretch it to six unless you served a side dish.",
