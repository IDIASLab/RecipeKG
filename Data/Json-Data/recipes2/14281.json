I also add finely sliced and chopped celery, cucumber(blotted to absorb lots of its moisture),chives and sliced green onions. Toss the broccoli and cauliflower into a Cuisinart, and give them a couple of whirls so that they are itsy, bitsy pieces. sprinkle the veggies and cheese over the cream cheese mixture. We like Ranch Dressing Mix substituted for the salad mix. Oh, yes, a sprinkling of finely grated cheddar cheese(look in the refrigerator section where all the packaged cheese are displayed),is a nice addition. Enjoy!",
