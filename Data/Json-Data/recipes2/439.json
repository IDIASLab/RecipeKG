I am glad I did because it was so good. Thanks for the awesome recipe!! I am gonna try this in the summer when it is nicer out and the fruit is sweeter and I can carry it out without freezing because N.Y. is sooo cold now!:(",

Too bad papaya is not something I have on hand as readily as these other fruits because I'm sure this smoothie would have been even better more unique with it. I didn't have yogurt so I was FORCED to use homemade vanilla ice cream. (I don't think the smoothie suffered because of it and I know we didn't!) I used red grapes and in hindsight wouldn't have as they left annoying and unattractive little bits of red skin in the smoothie even after blending the heck out of it. I used fresh squeezed orange juice and cantaloupe as well as the honeydew. This smoothie served doubly duty - not only was it good and good for you but it was also an efficient way to use up a bunch of fruit before heading out of town!",
