We pound our 1/2 inch to 1/4 inch slices with the flat side of the mallet first to even it out then with the tenderizing side. Don't pound it into paste but pound it enough to knock all the toughness out of it. When it looks it's just about ready to fall apart it is perfect. I can't stand it when it is tough and I think this is why people don't like it.",
