I frosted the top of a lemon pound cake and it was awesome. I like the consistency of this frosting it doesn't run yet it is firm enough for spreading. I will definitely use this again with and without the pineapple juice. In my opinion it's the right amount of each ingredient for what I was looking for of course. Thanks Candy Lady after searching hours for a frosting I finally found something right for me.",

Even better? Coconut all over the cake....TRULY tropical.
