If you can't find the lime leaves, you can add extra lime juice to taste, but do try to find the lime leaves because they make a big difference.  It tastes just like my local Thai restaurant!",

I substituted a 4 ounce can of (mild) diced chiles for the hot chile paste. Finally I cut the fish sauce down to 3 tablespoons. This was a delicious soup for a cold winter dinner.",

I found it slightly too salty and sour, though.  Next time will cut back on the lime juice and fish sauce.  And I wanted some protein, so I added in deveined, shelled, raw prawn.  After we had eaten, I went back and tinkered with the broth some more to see if I could improve it.  I added sugar, and voila, all better!  The sweet element was the missing flavor that I was looking for.  I have to admit I also missed the bit of fat from coconut milk here, but I guess that's a whole different soup, isn't it?  Tom Ka Gai, anyone?  : )",
