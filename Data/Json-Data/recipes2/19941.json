Did I get rave reviews and some went home clutching the recipe.Since my friend isn't a big Italian anything fan I added the cumin to Caesar dressing along with a half packet of fajita seasoning. It made great dressing. I gave everyone a choice of dressings. Most chose the Caesar but the Italian was outstanding too. Thanks for a fantastic salad Nicki. This is a keeper.",
