So I tried making it again and slicing the potatoes super thin and still had the problem of crunchy potatoes and sad looking green onions. In the future I will bake the dish in the oven instead of using the microwave. Crunchy potatoes aside the flavor of the dish was good and the leftovers were good cold. I recommend the recipe but just not the microwaving part.",

Delicious and refreshing! AND I got to use my microwave to make it! Thanks Lutzcat for the recipe!",
