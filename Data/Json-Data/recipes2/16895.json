I use a full cup of heavy cream the butter and chives (dried are fine) instead of dill and I add a little minced garlic. Oh and I just add the vegetables to the pasta for the last 5 minutes or so of cooking instead of sauteeing separately. I make the sauce in a separate small pan then toss all together. Delicious!
