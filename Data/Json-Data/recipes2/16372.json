Also, since potatoes, onions, and milk are all cheap, and the radish greens were \"free\", this made for an inexpensive side dish. And tasty as well. I will definitely be making this with our radish tops from now on!  UPDATE: I have to change this to five stars because my wife has started buying radishes just so we can make this soup. She doesn't like radishes though, so now we're eating the tops and throwing away the radishes. Not what I had in mind when I searched for this recipe!",

You could probably cut the cream out if you wanted to cut some calories, but the milk did make it a bit creamier.  I'll never throw my radish tops out again!

The radishes in our garden had rather gotten away from us -- more leaves than roots, so I went looking for \"tops\" recipes (I knew they had to be edible somehow!) and I found this!  I subbed bacon fat for the butter but skipped the heavy cream, and subbed homemade turkey broth for the chicken broth. I also cooked the onions past \"tender\" because carmelized onions make everything better, IMHO.  I used a couple of larger potatoes and I didn't bother to measure the greens; I just threw in everything I had.  I also skipped the radish garnish -- the leaves were older and huge, and the roots were inedible. I pureed half for me and left the other half chunky for DH and we both liked it.  He added salt; I did not.  Might add cheese next time; might add pepper.  Or not!  Either way, this recipe is now in our \"garden rotation.\" Thanks so much for sharing this!",
