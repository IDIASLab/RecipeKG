I whisked the milk, sugar, eggs, and vanilla together, then stuck the bowl in the fridge for a bit while eating dinner. I cut two slices about 3/4 to 1-inch thick, dipped, fried, ate. Yum! I put a little Country Crock on the end product, the icing sugar was unnecessary (already very sweet). Thanks for a great snack idea!",
