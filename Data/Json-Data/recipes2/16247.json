I think this is the best whole wheat pasta out there because it doesnt have a gritty texture and actually tastes like pasta. I used fat free half and half instead of cream and thickened it with 1tsp cornstarch dissolved in a little water before pouring it in. I also suggest topping this with some fresh chopped parsley. This was fast and delicious. Thanks Traci!",

Made a couple of additions... Saute a couple of large cloves of garlic in the reserved oil until soft and fragrant dicard garlic. Add shrimp and/or scallops sprinkle with 1/8 - 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes. Stir and cook a minute then add the artichokes tomatoes and 1 tbsp fresh or 1 tsp dried basil. After adding the cream and parmesan stir in the chopped olives and 1 - 2 tbsp drained capers salt and white pepper to taste. Toss with the pasta and heat through. I served it with a caesar salad and garlic bread. My boyfriend went crazy he loved it. Says it in his top ten fav's. Kudos to Traci for this recipe.",

I strained out the juice and reduced it added 1/2 of the small carton of cream cooked it and then added it back to the scallop/shrimp mixture. Then I added 1/2 the pasta. This way there is more seafood and less pasta to enjoy. It turned our perfect. My husband loved it and asked that I make it again. I had cooked up the whole package of pasta and used the other half the following night to make a cold pasta salad.",

I used fat free half and half to make it a little healtheir and mixed in a couple tablespoons of flour to the half and half before adding it in as I like my sauces pretty thick and creamy. Finally I added about 4 or 5 leaves of fresh basil at the last minute because I had it on hand in the garden.
