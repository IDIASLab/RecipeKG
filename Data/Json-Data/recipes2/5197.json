I put that mixture on top of the roasted potato wedges and topped with chopped sweet onion and tomatoes and then topped all with Mexican shredded cheese. I served with taco sauce and sour cream. DH loved it and went back for seconds. Very pleased with this and look forward to making it again. Thanks for the recipe!",

It's a very flexible yummy dish you could easily make an appetizer or as a side. I also added one red pepper diced Half a cup of corn I feel those additions really made the dish pop and gave it the extra boost in taste. Served with side sour cream but not necessary it's great without. Oh and don't make the same mistake I made by putting wax paper on baking sheet a few potatoes got stuck to it lol! Enjoy! Thank you",
