Flavor is that of the cabernet but the schnapps and juice cut the heaviness and make it pop. Reminds me of a Kir (white wine and cr\u00e8me de cassis) but made with ingredients that compliment red wines and a splash is a matter of interpretation so a little or a lot is your preference. Perfect in a tall glass over ice. Careful because it goes down real easy. Buy a cabernet you like. You can get great cabernets for under 10 (IMO). (recipe made for RECIPE GROUP ). I know I'll make this often as it is already a favorite. Thanks MARIGOLDDESIGNS for this \"Spootacular\" drink recipe!!",

I'm not a wine drinker but I tried it. Let's just say I loved the cranberry and raspberry schnapps mixture....the wine part not so much. My dear SIL (the wine lover) on the other hand LOVED it and this review is based on her tasting. She thought the 3 ingredients went well together. Thought a splash of the schnapps and juice was the perfect amount for a wine changer. When she left I sent the rest of the wine bottle home with her....I will be making my own concoction with the remainder of the cranberry juice and raspberry schnapps.
