The filling reminds me of samosas but next time I would add more such as green chiles and peas. I also microwaved the potatoes instead of boiling because it is easier. My husband suggested adding sour cream or milk or something more to it to make it a bit saucier because with the tortillas it ends up dry. It was quick to make and tasty so I have no complaints but it was not great yet.",
