That works out to about four times more flour than the recipe called for. I only fried one nugget to try. I thought it was okay but I like soft gummy doughy things. Others might not enjoy the texture and I certainly don't think this supplies any real sort of vegetable benefit. I'm going to try adding corn meal salt and sugar to the mix to try and make this into something approximating hush puppies.",

I had to add more flour than it called for (probably about 1/4 to 1/3 cup total when I was finished) because it just didn't clump enough to make balls. That could have been because I made the creamed corn from scratch though. I had a hard time dipping them in the cornmeal but they fried up well enough.
