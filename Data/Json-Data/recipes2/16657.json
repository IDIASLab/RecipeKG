PLEASE at least a few of us need to rate it AS IS.  It's not like chicken recipes where you get to say \"3 more minutes in the oven and a squeeze of lemon saved this recipe.\"  \n\nA curry is something you accept or don't accept.  \n\nThat is my story and I'm sticking to it.\n\nI think this rendition of a mild curry is excellent.  As another reviewer stated, it didn't have any of the sweet spices.  I am a home chef for a food publication and just recently, a recipe was given to me that required \"curry powder.\"  I bought a bottle, but it's at work, since I also fix lunch for the office.  I was desperate because it was the last night to review the test recipe.\n\nThis mild curry powder was a fantastic base for the \"curry gravy.\"  It lends itself to hundreds of variations.  \n\nBut just let this one be.",
