I served this on wheat bread with a leafy lettuce as a sandwich. I served the sandwich with a recipe from this website called Tangy Dill Potatoe salad also excellent. I cheated on the potatoe salad and used dried dill vs fresh and it was good. I hate spending alot on ingredients if I have something I'll use it.It was a nice cool meal for a hot Texas day. Tonight we are going to have some Bahama Mama's also on this website. Great combination for a hot day. I made the salads in the am went shopping and about my day came home and dinner was ready to go. Make the salads in the am and by dinner time the flavors are all absorbed. Good stuff!!",
