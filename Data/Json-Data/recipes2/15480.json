My only complaint was that it did become a bit grainy as it set although it didn't hinder the flavor. It stays very soft; it would have been nice to have been able to mold it into a round in order to freeze it. It does make an awful lot so it can be cut in half with plenty to go around.",

For me I think that will mean less cherry preserves and less powdered sugar. Also maybe regular cream cheese instead of the reduced fat version. I would like less sweetness and more of a butter consistency. When I made this hubby compared the texture to yogurt and I agreed.",

What you do taste is the cherry preserves, so buy a good one.  A little on the soft/runny side for a spread, so be sure to refrigerate to allow it to firm up.  If I make again, I might just add a bit more cream cheese to improve the consistency.  This is very different and very good, and I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to serve to company.
