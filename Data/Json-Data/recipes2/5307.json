I don't know exactly why, maybe it was the soy sauce or that it is watered down so much with milk. I make mine with a heavier soup and no soy sauce and real thinly sliced onions in it while it bakes.",

Just used regular frozen  green beans and the taste was also fabulous.\n\nMade thin-sliced homemade onion rings as well.\n\nIn the end, a lot more time consuming than this easy original.
