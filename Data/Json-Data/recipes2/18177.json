Everyone ate it liked it and said we'll have to have this again. The only thing I did differently was I didn't marinate the chops for more than about 15 minutes TOTAL and this still turned out moist and fabulous! Thanks!",

These are soooo good under the broiler, its the next best thing to grilling them outside. I added fresh chopped garlic, which I personally prefer over minced jarred garlic. If you are using thin chops, you may not want to marinate them quite as long as suggested in the recipe or they will be a little salty. Great recipe and so simple!",
