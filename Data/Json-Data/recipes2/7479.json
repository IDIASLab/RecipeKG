This recipe was originally a little cake recipe, but he always preferred these to real blueberry muffins. These are so good you can't even tell the difference between the real recipe and the gluten-free recipe! I prefer these with finely chopped canned peaches instead of the blueberries, so I usually make 6 peach and 6 blueberry. Hope you enjoy!",

The amount of sugar was too much for my tastes. Thanks for a good recipe.",

It's fantastic because you don't need muffin liners or greasing of any kind. I used only 1/2 cup of granulated sugar (which I might reduce to 1/3 cup next time as they are plenty sweet) I reduced the butter to 2/3 cup but could probably reduce it a smidge further. And lastly I used Namaste Perfect Blend GF flour. This blend is so close to regular flour and I'm very happy with it in most of my baked goods. I baked it all at 375 for 13 minutes and they came out perfectly. ( I live at sea level so you may need to adjust if you're at higher altitudes) They're a little sweet and really moist and tender. This is going into my regular muffin rotation.",
