We don't keep pina colada mix on hand so I opted to use a combination of coconut milk and pineapple juice for the mix...and I kept forgetting to pick up pineapple juice so in the end I opened a can of crushed pineapple and use some of that juice. A few of the pineapple bits poured out and I liked the result of teeny bits of fruit on the finished product. My only other change was to use a Portuguese Saloio Bread kind of dense chewy tiny hint of sweetness and that paired beautifully with the pina colada flavors as well as being a great \"French toast\" bread! I did experiment by sprinkling a couple of the dipped slices of bread with some shredded coconut before pan-frying but some pieces burned a bit so next time I'll just have toasted coconut to offer as an additional topping. Wonderful summery breakfast idea! Thanks laughingmagpie!",

The bananas seemed a little out of place to me and I think I would prefer garnishing it with pineapple and most definitely coconut but hubby thought they were just fine with the bananas. I only used 6 eggs in the egg dip because 8 just seemed like a lot but I measured everything else the same.",
