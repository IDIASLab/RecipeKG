If I were to make it again I'd make a few changes. If use sesame oil rather than olive oil I'd use rice noodles rather than angel hair and I'd be sure to use Napa cabbage rather than red. I'd also probably throw in some other veggies like bean sprouts or baby corn. I don't think I'll be making it again as is. However the Smithfield marinated pork loin was delicious! I also loved how quick this recipe is! It only took me about 20 minutes from start to finish and I love that aspect!",
