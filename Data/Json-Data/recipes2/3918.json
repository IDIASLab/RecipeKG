It seems like the Bailey's curdles up almost instantly. Once it does the drink is no good.",

I cannot acquire a taste for beer as much as I would like to as my husband enjoys it occasionally. The important thing in this drink is as soon as the shot glass is dropped in you have to chug it or it curdles. It really does taste like chocolate milk. As for the name in response to another review there are a lot of crude names but I think it is in reference to the whiskey and Irish cream and how much liquor is in this drink. I don't think it was meant to offend anyone.",
