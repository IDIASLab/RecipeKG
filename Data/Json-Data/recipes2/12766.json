Needed to add in a little olive oil for sauteing the onions after the sausage was browned as the chorizo didn't render much fat. Also added Garlic to ours. Sauteed several cloves of garlic (thinly sliced) in the sausage fat and olive oil before the onion cooked through. Be careful you don't add the garlic too soon though as the onion will take longer to cook than the garlic. We also subbed in red potatoes rather than the russets that Chef John used.",

Very disappointing for us as devout Chef John followers. I basically refuse to waste food so to salvage it I've been putting about 3c at a time into a medium Pyrex pan covering with 1/2c enriched white rice and 1c water or 1 small packet of Saffron Rice Mix and 1c water. I bake it for like an hour( ) at 350 stirring occasionally to turn the already thick nature into a casserole.",
