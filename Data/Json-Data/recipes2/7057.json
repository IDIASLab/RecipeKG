I would definitely add chopped green onions and maybe some chopped artichoke hearts or maybe even green olives! I served this with Uncle Ben's Brown Rice & Quinoa which we thought was a perfect complement to the chicken and I opted to use chicken breast as suggested by the submitter of the recipe. I have a little left over chicken that I added to the rice and I'm thinking I'll LOVE it cold tomorrow as a salad-type dish for my lunch. I'll add in the green onions and I just know it will be perfect. Thank you so much Michael because it gives me something to look forward to tomorrow!",
