My only changes were that I used fresh button mushrooms finely chopped and sauteed in pan coated with butter-flavored cooking spray; sauteed them with the chopped garlic and a little kosher salt. And just because I thought they would be easier to eat that way I diced the pepperoni instead of cutting them into strips. I almost always keep string cheese in the snack drawer and now I'll have to add egg roll wrappers to the list of staples because these were delicious fun and easy; plus they're a great jumping-off point for more embellished variations. Already thinking about stuffing an egg roll wrapper w/ a quarter of a banana a few caramel chews a handful of salted roasted nuts and few semi-sweet chocolate chips - Doesn't that sound incredible?:)",

The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because the instructions did not state that in order to keep the cheese from oozing out is to cut the cheese in HALF then roll up and pinch the ends. This is not going to be very pleasant on the eyes if your cheese is falling out both sides of the won ton wrappers. I also did this with ham and cheese. That was also delicious.
