This recipe caught my attention for a simple ham and bean soup - and is what I call a \"label recipe\" - i.e., a manufacturers recipe to promote and sell a product. There's several of these I've made and enjoyed over the years; Swanson's chicken stock has a wonderful and simple chicken noodle soup recipe, Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup makes a tasty chicken and rice, etc. I'd never heard of Idahoan Roasted Garlic flavored mashed potatoes, but was easy enough to find at the grocery store for under a buck.\n\nThe recipe was followed save for 2 substitutions; chicken stock was used instead of vegetable stock, mostly because I hate vegetable stock and it's not easy to find - which I take to mean everyone else hates it too. The other substitution was fresh parsley - we grow our own and dry it for winter use. So to reconstitute the dried parsley, I added it to the stock before adding the potato mixture.\n\nWe really enjoyed the soup, together with some City Sour Sourdough bread (made in Portland, OR). There was no need for extra salt with the potato mixture. All it needed was a little pepper.\n\nIn the end, my wife who is a former foods teacher said what she always says when I come up with a winner \"I'd let you make that for me again\". \n\nTo which I replied \"I'd let you wash the dishes\" - which always provokes her to laugh that laugh that says \"d",
