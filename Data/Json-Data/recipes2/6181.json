I then baked them on a roasting rack in a shallow pan in a 325 oven for 25 minutes.They turned out perfectly!!It was delicious and I didn't have to spend all that time over a grill. I thought that the blue cheese butter while good could have used a little something. Next time I think I'll add a little garlic salt to the butter. Thanks for the recipe!",
