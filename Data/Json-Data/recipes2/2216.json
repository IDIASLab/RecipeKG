I started out making just half a batch as I was not sure how they would turn out... loved them SO much that I am making another batch! I rolled into smaller balls maybe 1/2 inch balls so that I could make more.... I also adjusted the cooking time since I made them smaller I think 15 minutes and I started checking them.... a light light brown on the bottom tasted best..... Also I refrigerated the dough overnight and it was rock-hard so you have to allow at least 30 minutes to thaw before rolling into balls.",
