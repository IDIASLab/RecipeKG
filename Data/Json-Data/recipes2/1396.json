But I'm not letting my love for her get in my way. I had some leftover chicken from a very mild chicken dinner last night and just to add a little more I bought a grilled chicken breast from Vons (Safeway---or now maybe Albertsons). I used Classico's Alfredo Sauce and added to it Herdez's Guajillo Chile Cooking Sauce. Because this was just for the two of us I didn't measure anything---just mixed until it looked right to us. I didn't use Pico de gallo because the Herdez sauce with the Classico Fresh Alfredo Sauce was just perfect! On the top I used a guacamole recipe by Paula from this site (Guacamole My Way) and I topped it with just a touch of sour cream. I can't tell you how wonderful this was for us! Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Thank you so much Patty Cakes! P.S. The bacon addition was genius!",
