A tip for those who want to eliminate the \"wild game\" taste as much as possible is to soak the duck breasts in salted ice water for about an hour before using.  I suggest about a Tablespoon of salt per quart.  Make sure to use ice water as it will draw out blood.  Then rinse the breasts thoroughly and quickly pat dry with paper towel before adding to the marinade.  This recipe is a keeper!",

Allow meat to rest 10 mins before cutting.   If you overcook- it will give a more wild taste. We eat a variety of game meat all the time. This is the best tip someone should use.",

The grilled duck breast should be cooked to 130 degrees F and then removed from the grill to keep it from tasting gamey.  It will look very red when cut and should run pinkish juice.  You do not have to soak it in brine.  I do half my ducks with this recipe and the other half using Soy instead of Worcestichire sauce.  The rule with wild duck is to not overcook it.",

The flavor of the marinade was fine, but our meat still had a little \"wild\" flavor.  Next time, we will soak it a little in brine before we marinate.  We also grilled this for about 10-12 minutes on each side and as you can see in the picture, it still came out medium rare.  I guess duck is an extremely bloody meat.  Thanks for the recipe, RKC.  I will try this marinade again.",

We shot one Goldeneye (crappy bird) and one hen wood duck (very tasty bird). I wrapped the Goldeneye with jalepeno slices along with bacon. I wrapped the Wood Duck with bacon only. Fried both bird breats. My father who has been hunting for 45 plus years thought the jalepeno was the Wood Duck. I can't imagine how good it would have been if I would have marinated it for 24 hours. Will do this over and over again. Great appetizer!!!",
