Putting this together was a breeze and I liked that it only used one pot. I didn't have any crushed tomatoes so I subbed diced tomato with chilies which I ran through the blender to puree. I was impressed with the amount of flavor for such a small amount of ingredients. The kids gobbled it right up and already want to know when I'll be making it again. We topped with sour cream diced tomatoes green onion and tortilla chips. This is will definitely be one of our \"in a rush\" go-to dinners.",
