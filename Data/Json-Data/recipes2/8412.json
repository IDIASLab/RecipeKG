I attempted to follow the directions exactly as outlined. Having never roasted peppers before, mine came out a little too crispy in the end. I believe this was my error and should have only halved my peppers rather than quartering. I sliced he onions as suggested and they burned to a crisp. I guess this is where my inexperience comes in. The chicken was perfect. Crispy skin but still moist and tender. I used Hot Italian sausage and that also came out beautifully and some of the heat made it's way into the chicken. All in all, loved this dish and will make it again. I will either add the onions later or maybe skip them altogether and have more of the sweet peppers. Thanks Chef John for making me look good :)",

I asked my wife before cooking it if she wanted any, and she declined, telling me to cut the recipe in half so I wouldn't have excessive leftovers. As it was roasting she was drawn to the kitchen and remarked that it smelled good. She returned later asking when it would be ready and did I make enough for her after all. When she saw it, she said it looked beautiful, and after eating it raved about how much she loved it. Oh, and I loved it too. I might add whole heirloom carrots next time and experiment around with red potatoes or something just for fun, but still great just as it is.",

I don't know if Chef John intended using precooked or smoked types. The flavor from the sausage took this dish to decedent. And additional or various other veggies that work well roasted would make it even better. They're supposed to get a bit black (esp. sweet peppers) or brown, and crisp. That's the goal. Then they're sweet and lovely.  This dish is very easy, short on time needed to preprep, and really elegant. Great with crusty bread or a good green salad. Thanks, John.",

You HAVE to use spicy sausage though, sweet sausage doesn't give it that  kick like the spicy does, just cut them to 1-inch slices instead of two because wow, it's spicy. Be generous with the salt, but two teaspoons is a bit much.  I kinda eyeballed it. I wish my supermarket sold organic chicken thighs skin on and bone in, but I made an exception because I didn't want to sacrifice the flavor.  Bon appetit!!",
