I know it's olive oil but it's hard to say this recipe is \"healthy\" with so many fat calories. The texture is a bit odd too. Not crispy like you might expect bars to be and the oatmeal stays firm inside an otherwise soft/eggy dough. Also it was a lot of chocolate. I'd suggest using half the amount of chocolate and putting in some dried fruit to up the nutrition and cut the fat/calories/sweetness.",
