                "reviewBody": "Very tasty! I only used 0.5 cups of wine to 1 cup of Clamato, as I was running low on wine. Besides, I wanted the main flavour to be the Clamato... I also added some salt & few hearty dashes of Tabasco sauce to the liquid before cooking the mussels. (My idea was to make the broth like a spicy Bloody Ceasar cocktail.) The clamato really gives the mussels a kick that is a nice change from the classic garlic/wine French method. I did use the butter in the recipe, but I find it doesn't thicken the sauce that much anyway, and it almost tasted better before I added the butter, so this step will be optional for me in the future. I had lots of leftovers, so will add some diced tomatoes & tomato paste to the mussel meat and broth and turn it into a pasta sauce another night. What a great way to enjoy mussels, thanks for the recipe -- I will be sure to make this again and again!",
