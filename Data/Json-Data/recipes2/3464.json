Refreshing filling and pretty to look at I followed the recipe as written except I omitted the mint...I've made it 2 times in the last two days make sure your fruit is ripe and you won't need any sweetener and if you can use freshly squeezed orange juice and slightly frozen fruit even better! Thanks for sharing your recipe Francine!",

All my fruit was frozen so I had to use the Vitamix to get this blended up really good. I added a little flax seed which I do to all of my smoothies for added health benefits. We really enjoyed the combination and will enjoy again soon with the flaked coconut on top. I will be picking that up at the store as I didn't have any for this round.",
