I added the meat from a grocery store roast chicken (I like to buy the cold ones left over from the day before for recipies-very economical and easy). We don't like things too spicy, so I skipped the cajun seasoning and red pepper flakes. It was delicious! The Rotel tomatoes and sofrito added just the right amount of heat for us. It was quite hearty and I served it with a nice crusty French bread. My husband said it was his new favorite chicken stew! It's just perfect for a chilly fall evening. I'm making another batch today and delivering it to my son, who is working from home and eating entirely too much takeout!",
