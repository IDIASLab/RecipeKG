I also sprinkled the top layer with parsley for color and pepper. I really liked the seasoning salt flavor! The method for cooking the potatoes seems strangely complicated. I just poked the potatoes with a fork microwaved them for 15-20 minutes and then sliced them. Leavin the skin on is not only easier but retains the vitamins in the skins. I used low fat sour cream and margarine and next time might try to sub chicken broth for half the margarine and use fat free sour cream. Thanks for the delicious recipe! Update I've made this many times since I make the sauce with pureed cottage cheese instead of sour cream (add 2 t lemon juice) 3/4 cup chicken broth and 1/4 cup light margarine. A bit healthier and still delicious!",

Usually do two layers of eggs and three of potatoes. After layering is complete add condensed milk to sour cream until it is pourable pour over casserole and bake at 350 until it is bubbling.
