I followed the recipe exactly but the sauce was very runny and never firmed up. Perhaps the type of apples I used (red delicious) were too juicy. That being said the taste was still very yummy and we can't stop eating them. It's just very messy and not all that pleasant to look at. Next time I will try a different type of apple and I will cut back on the corn syrup to see if the caramel firms up.",
