I added county herb dry salad mix with a half teaspoon of dill and left it over night. At other suggestions I also added an extra 1/2 cup of sour which helped stretch it a bit more.I also used english cucumbers because they are a perfect size. Topped them off with more dill and this is a must - Dill dill dill - I am glad they were all eaten because they are so addictive that if any came home I would of ate them! If you need to make an impression on a large group make these you can't go wrong. I also think it is a reasonably priced recipe to make for 100 plus people.",
