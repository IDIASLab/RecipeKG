Added a little cilantro with parsley and basil. arugula awesome used goat cheese instead of Gorgonzola and drizzled balsamic with the olive oil and topped with avocado. I was nervous as I served it for dinner without trying it first. HUGE hit!! Loved it!! Always like to adlib recipes to my liking... Perfect spring/summer salad. Will definitely do it again and may add caramelized walnuts next time. Thank you",
