Personally I like a lot of flavor so the first time I made this as written (using chipotle powder in the filling since it wasn't very clear on the ingredients list) and thought it was good but could be better. The next time I added a half can of rinsed and drained black beans a chipotle pepper in adobo (diced) that I had left over from something else and about a cup of shredded \"Mexican blend\" cheese into the filling. It was to die for! I also got a few more flautas out of it that way lol. Served it up with some yellow rice that I added a bit of diced red pepper onion and jalape\u00f1o to and a guacamole salad as well. Don't get me wrong the original recipe was tasty! It just needed a bit more pizzazz for me. Try it once by the book and then see what you think would make it suit you even better. Also if you're not a fan of chipotle use regular chili powder instead.",

I put the cream of chicken soup chicken seasonings (eyeballed everything) and added cheese in a bowl and mixed it all together. I had larger flour tortillas so I eyeballed it and put enough mix to go down the length of the tortillas about an inch wide. The tortillas we used were pliable enough we didn't need to warm them to work with them. We placed them seam side down without using a toothpick generously sprayed them with cooking spray and sprinkled with chipotle pepper. We baked it accordingly and then saved the remaining flautas for heated them up during the week for on the go food.",
