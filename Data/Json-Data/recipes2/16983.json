One person thinks that it tastes - impossibly, look at the ingredients - like *flour*. Another person is obviously bored and wants to insult someone. A couple people think it's not sweet enough - okay, I might buy that. I made this exactly as written this morning. A perfectly decent strawberry-banana smoothie, a little heavy on the cinnamon (which I thought was interesting rather than offensive). My fruit was quite ripe, so the sweetness was perfect for me. Mine is just another opinion. Thanks for the recipe!",
