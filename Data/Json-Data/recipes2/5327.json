Super low in carbs, yet such a satisfying dish you will forget it's made from a vegetable and not a grain. There are two reasons I opted for roasted riced cauliflower in place of sauteed: 1) more flavor and 2) better texture.",

This method worked great too! I made it as directed but cut recipe in half using on 1 head. I use a cheese grater to \"rice\" my cauliflower and works perfectly. Served with a healthy chicken stirfry and some salad. Love how this can take place of a starch..plus its way more flavorful then rice.",

Mixed together in a large bowl along with with the garlic and onion, plus generous pours of mostly olive oil but also a dash of sesame oil, a hefty teaspoon of kosher salt, and a palmful of dried thyme plus oregano. Spread maybe 3/4 of an inch deep in a large pan and roasted at 400F for 25-ish minutes, mixing regularly until I got the texture I wanted. The colors were beautiful and the dish was so delicious. Expectations exceeded! Will be making this regularly. Thank you for the recipe.",
