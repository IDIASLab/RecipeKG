I used 100% pure pumpkin puree from a can not the pumpkin pie filling. The pumpkin puree and spice also adds to the pumpkin flavor. I made this drink in a Vitamix blender so adjust blending time as needed to create a uniform consistency. Garnish if desired with additional pumpkin spice whipped cream or both.

When my husband first asked what I was making I said \"A pumpkin spice Kahlua drink\" and he made a face and said \"You lost me at pumpkin spice!\";) It didn't sound appealing to him but he changed his mind! I made it as the recipe called for but we really couldn't taste the Kahlua much so we added another 1/4 cup. Perfect! We will make this one again. Ours definitely didn't look as pretty as the picture though.;) Thanks for the recipe!",

The first time I made it I wasn't counting ice cubes and added too much ice and it got pretty thick, so I had to add more milk to get it to blend. The second time I added more Kahlua to get more of the taste and less ice, but it was great both times. Just be prepared, it will still get thick in the blender.",
