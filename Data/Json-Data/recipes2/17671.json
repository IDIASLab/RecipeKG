I added a little more honey, less sesame oil(would use a tablespoon or less), definitely used mirin, soy sauce(low sodium - it's what I have) and rice wine vinegar.  Some wasabi paste added to the marinade and dipping sauce is a must for some zip. I cut the steaks so that they are about 1/2 to 3/4\" thick and sear for about 40 seconds.  If they are thicker they burn before they even cook a little - I like them pink, not red in the middle. Preheat cast iron, but be sure to turn down the head to medium high or you will have smoke and smoke alarms going off.   Sesame Seeds - don't bother - I've tried it both ways, they don't add much, and they pop all over the place when you sear the steaks and make a mess. ( I lightly toasted them first - so if you have to have them - toast them, then dip the seared steaks just before you serve, and save yourself a lot of clean up. I served  with plain rice or long grain and wild rice.  Great to sop up the dipping sauce.",

Still perfect. This recipe rocks because my house doesn't stink like fish as long as I use the pan's lid while cooking! I split more like 30/70 for the sauce, because we like extra to put on our rice (and there is still plenty to dredge the fish in). I \"dry\" the fish with paper towels after thawing so it will absorb more of the sauce.",

Virgin olive oil on its own is a very healthy fat, but when heated past its smoking point - the temperature at which fats begin to break down, unique to each variety of fat - it can potentially do you more harm than good. Estimates can vary, but I've usually seen olive oil's smoking point cited between about 375-450 degrees fahrenheit, depending on the type. Searing can involve temperatures twice that high. \n\nSo that's something to consider.",
