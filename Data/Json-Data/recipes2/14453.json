What I ended up with was the original plus some cooked potatoes, frozen carrots and about a cup of frozen stew vegetables.  As for the batter, I didn't have curry as I'd thought, so substituted dry mustard and chives.  It still could have had more flavor but I will be happy to keep trying by adjusting the amounts and trying new ingredients (maybe in place of the potatoes).  Thanks, Roxanne, for a great, basic recipe I promise to try your way one of these meals. I'm sure it will have more flavor but I just felt I had to try more than onions and peppers the first time around!",
