But what s not to like I asked him because I thought in addition to serving its purpose as a respectable side dish to the chicken enchiladas I served it with it was pretty tasty nicely flavored. I mean it had peppers and onions and a little tomato (and a dab of butter just because). Since I used chicken broth and not the unusual variety the recipe called for (I ve never seen it) I added some Penzey s taco seasoning and some garlic powder to compensate. I d rate it a decent four stars but I had to know what it was he didn t like. So I pressed the issue. The beans he said. Oh my. The beans. The rice which he said was okay but then gave himself away by leaving half of it on his plate was a fail because of the beans. Unbelievable. Well he s wrong.",
