Used this to glaze my daughter Ashley's icecream birthday cake today and I'm still scoopin' up what fell to the plate!!!! I swear, I didn't even eat the cake; only your glaze. The kids and hubby were rolling their eyes and watching me as I was \"mmmmmmmmmmmmming\" over this as they were all munching on the cake. For all who are interested, I have a big problem melting chocolate. Sometimes it comes out just fine, but other times, it gets all dry and clumpy. Don't get it because I've done the microwave method and the double boiler. This was amazing because with the addition of the condensed milk it came out perfectly! No fuss, no muss. Family commends you because they know what I go thru and they loved it. Thank you so much darlin'!",
