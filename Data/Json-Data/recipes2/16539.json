The Shiraz honey reduction was very good (and easy to make) although it took about 20 minutes to reduce.",

Anyway I had some leftover pork medallions (seasoned w/ a bit of salt & pepper & sauteed in EVOO) & thought I would try this glaze on them. Just for grins I also made the ras el hanout (googled a recipe) & sprinkled a bit on a couple of the medallions before I reheated them. (I sprinkled them w/ some water to keep them from drying out then the spices then heated them in a 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes while I prepared the glaze). The medallions that didn't have the spices were too sweet from the glaze (it reminded me of a grape jelly glaze but I'm sure the addition of meat drippings which I didn't use would add an extra dimension of flavor) but the ones w/ the spices were wonderful! We loved the spices w/ the glaze...I'm so glad I tried it on pork. I served it w/ curried shrimp bisque & a salad w/ hot buttered apple cider for dessert. Thnaks for a very enjoyable recipe Lissa Metz-Gomez!",

I would get a head start on that wine reduction sauce though it takes a while to cook.
