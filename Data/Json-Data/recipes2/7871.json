I didn't have Orange cream Greek yogurt so I subbed in Regular yoplait orange cream yogurt in its place. All the correct flavors for the basic recipe were used in the exact amounts other then those two things. Sounded really good and we wanted to try it so we went ahead. I nearly killed my 1000w ninja blender that poor blender was crying so I added extra orange juice to compensate for my frozen berries rather then water to keep the flavors. What I got at the end was a good flavored smoothie that was almost like a sorbet. You coulda seriously ate this with a spoon. I give this rating based on the flavors and the kids opinions. I was not going to give a lower rating because of my error. We will definately try this again with not frozen berries and see what happens though. Kids were happy it was like having icy dessert for breakfast with my mistake. It's worth trying you could always add to the oj or the strawberries or small modifications to make it more your thing if you make it and its not sweet enough or fruity enough for your tastes.",
