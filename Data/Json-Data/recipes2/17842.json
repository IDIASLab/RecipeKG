I used the food processor to chop the sun dried tomatoes then added the remaining ingredients and pulsed together. It worked perfectly for me. I was a tad confused by the instructions to roll up; it's probably me but I didn't understand why you couldn't just roll up starting on one end so that's what I did. I also didn't flip in the oven; I would've made a mess knowing me so I just let it bake for 10 minutes total on the same side and it worked fine. Served as a side with some soup and it made for a filling and warm dinner. Thanks for the recipe!",
