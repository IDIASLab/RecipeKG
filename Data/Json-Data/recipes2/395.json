I also used half almond milk & half chicken broth & thickened it with 4 ounces of cream cheese (I use fat-free). I used California mix & added a good bit of salt. I also added brown rice. Overall, this was a really great base recipe, but I always alter things either due to personal taste or food allergies. The seasonings were great, & the cheddar cheese before serving is a must!",
