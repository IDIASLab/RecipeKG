I actually made 2 different batches, one with whole wheat flour & chicken broth & the other with spelt flour & beef broth.\n\nI  used 3-4 T of oats & probably & kneaded more flour in until stickiness gone.  Roll out to no more than 1/4\" on floured surface (lots of flour!).  Then, I cut strips about 1/3\" x 3\" & twisted each end in opposite directions so it looks like a twisted skinny breadstick.  I also used a 4\" round cutter, then with a pastry cutter devided each round into 6 pie shaped pieces.  Looks like little nacho chips!\n\nI baked these at 300 for 30 minutes for the chips & 45 minutes for the twists.  Quinn, my lab-retriever mix loved them, but then again, she'll eat anything that isn't a rock.",
