I bought a ring of pre-cooked shrimp - plucked the tails and marinated them for an afternoon in 1tbs olive oil 1tsp lemon juice 1/2 tsp old bay seasoning and 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic. Then I wrapped them and the cheese in bacon sprinkled with parmesan/romano cheese blend and wrapped in a puff pastry square... oh my.... are they EVER GOOD! Thanks much for the ideas!",

This way there was very little cheese comming out and you could still taste it. I also broiled them in the oven untill the bacon was crispy.

While I dont think there is much you can do with the cheese melting out a little Ive noticed that if you use the half of bacon that isn't so \"lacy\" it works better. Also if you broil this treat for about 5-7 minutes instead of baking the bacon crips up quite nicely. It is very delicious and guests go nuts for them!",
