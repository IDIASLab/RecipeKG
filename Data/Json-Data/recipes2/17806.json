Thanks for this great basic recipe, Miss Betty! :)",

We made it to go with our beef stroganof and green beans and it was great. I am not sure what people are looking for when they need all those spices. My husband thinks it must be a main meal. We use our rolls for a light side. The only thing is that this is more like a bisquet than a roll. But is sure tastes good. It would be great as bisquets and gravy. Sorry about spelling here.

I did make one change because I was out of mayo, I used 2 T. ranch dressing instead, which gave them a light ranch flavor (very good!)
