Just that little bit of sweetness adds that extra \"surprise\" with each bite. My family & friends love it...thanks to Chef John!",

Even with a small head of cabbage it was a tight fit for all the ingredients. So the next time the only thing that I would do different. Is to start earlier giving  myself  plenty of time. Now cooking wise let the corned beef, potatoes, onions, carrots, cook to fork tender and done. Once fork tender done remove the corned beef,potatoes, onions and carrots aside. Now add the cabbage into the liquid cook cabbage till done. Also by doing this you can now adjust the cabbage to your taste if you like it spicy or sweet or just let it cook in the liquid till done. Overall a winner and a keeper recipe. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!!!!",

Followed this whole recipe, didn't work for us.\" The only thing that ended up being edible in this meal was the cabbage and the carrots. The potatoes weren't done, and the corned beef was not tender. I didn't change a single thing about the recipe; for all the timing, ingredient amounts, and methods that I stuck to, and the fact that CJ recipes rarely are a miss, but this was a major disappointment. Glad that my husband brought home a gorgeous bakery loaf of Irish soda bread b/c it tasted just marvelous sopping up the broth. The pot's been simmering for 6 hrs. now so I'll just leave it there til the potatoes are edible, but the corned beef's gone to the neighbor's dog.",
