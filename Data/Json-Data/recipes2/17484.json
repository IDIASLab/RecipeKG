I have to say it does not taste like oatmeal even after lots and lots of cinnamon. I'm giving it four stars anyway because it doesn't taste bad and I think it is worth trying. It is slightly chewy and if you use nonfat ricotta cheese this can be pretty healthy. You get protein and quite a bit of calcium.",
