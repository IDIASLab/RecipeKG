I love the taste of swiss cheese and swiss cheese french toast sounded delicious. Well the bad news. I followed the directions exactly and what I ended up with was a crusty burnt tasting french toast. But all is not at a loss. The problem is that swiss cheese placed on a buttered skillet basically burns even at medium to low heat. What I am going to do from now on is cook the french toast first with the egg milk and chive mixture and melt the swiss cheese on top. Basically the same but without the cheese burning. I think this should work. and still be cheesy french toast.",

I would suggest using 1 T butter and 1 T oil (I used grade seed oil) instead of all butter. I cooked one side on medium heat flipped them over topped with the shredded cheese and when the bottom was done I flipped them over again to toast the cheese. I didn't have tomato chutney so I made up a tomato / green onion / white onion and chives. Really a nice meal.",
