Mine thickened like it says it would, to a spreadable consistency. The flavor is just right: a perfect balance between sweet and fruity. I added more pectin on day two-as suggested for a thicker consistency- which I regretted. The result was not much thicker than before but too sweet. Next time, I'll stick to the recipe.
