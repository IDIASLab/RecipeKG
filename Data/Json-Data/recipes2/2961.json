The trick to make it taste fresh is to dress shortly before serving. The extra dressing in the bottle can be used the next day if there are leftovers to freshen the taste. My son likes the leftovers, but I think it tastes best the day it is made.",

I did an ingredient search for imitation crabmeat, with \"salad\" as the dish type, and this one was in the search results. I made it exactly as directed, but brought the leftover dressing along, in case people wanted to drizzle a bit more over theirs. It was well received by everyone. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

Also had no oil and vinegar dressing on hand so used Zesty Italian and the flavor was great! As I had dressed salad about 2 hours before the event we attended I added a bit more just before serving to \"freshen\" it up. It was good as evidenced by the empty bowl at the end of the event and perfect for the crowd there (no great foodies or lovers of spicy foods!) but next time when I make it for just us I plan to \"shake it up a bit\" and add some more vegies maybe nuts or dried fruit and spice it up a bit. But this is a great basic recipe ideal for most buffets or picnics and SUPER EASY to make even last-minute!!!",
