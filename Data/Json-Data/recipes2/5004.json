I was tickled when they came out perfect or so I thought. I bought the yellow corn tortillas and the cooking instructions said to use them at room temp. When I took them out of the mold after cooling for 2 minutes I immediately put in the lettuce rice mixture cheese and sour cream. The tortilla bowls were hard to break and hard to chew. I thought they would break like chips. What did I do wrong? I made another batch and left them in 10 minutes same result. I love this idea but want to eat the bowls not just use for show. Any comments would be greatly appreciated.",

For that I simply stirred in a couple Tbsp Hot sauce to the mix before assembling the salad. I have a confession to make.... I tried to make the shells out of the flour tortillas and they were a disaster so I used tortilla chips for the bottom of the bowl. Turns out my husband actually love it that way! Next time I will try adding some chicken or beef to it but really it's just fine like it is. I served mine with chopped avocado sour cream cilantro and a squeeze of lime. Delicious!",
