If you want a potato salad with celery and onions and paprika and other things, I'm sure you can find such a recipe on this website.  Why mess with one whose entire appeal is its simplicity?  Treating it as a \"base\" recipe is one thing, going on about all the extra things it \"needs\" is another.  Great dish for the younger guests at summer BBQs, since lots of kids are picky about onions and things.",

Be sure to use red potatoes boiled in their skins til fork tender then cool in cold water peel and dice. Mixed while still warm the flavors of the dressing will really meld with the potato and hard cooked diced egg. Chill for several hours or overnight for the best flavor!",
