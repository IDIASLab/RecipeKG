I cooked it on low for about 8 hours and don't add the half and half until one hour before finshed. If you do then it will curdle.  the easiest and best tasting clam chowder I have ever made!",

DOH!!.. could a recipe with base ingredients \"out of the can\" be better than a \"hand wringing\" personally inspected and selected batch of ingredients...???? Guess what.. RIGHT ON!!! Now for my \"MODS\"... everything the same \"EXCEPT\"... 6 slices of thick bacon crumbled; 1 TBSP of bacon fat reserved and added to the half cup of margarine (we used BUTTER) that I used to saute the 2 cups of onion 4 stalks of chopped celery hearts till translucent/tender and then added 4 Red Potatoes washed scrubbed and then cubed.. LEAVE THE SKINS ON.... We added this to the \"canned\" ingredients (but in our case they didn't have cream of potato soup so I went with 2 - 6.5 oz cans of cream of onion and 3 - 6.5 oz cans of clam chowder) and a 8 oz. bottle of Snows clam juice. All this was combined with a TBSP of parsley and 1 tsp each of thyme and dill. This was the BEST CLAM CHOWDER we have ever had... so simple it is mind boggling. TRY IT; YOU WILL LIKE IT.",
