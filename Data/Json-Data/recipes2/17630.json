A side of soy sauce was helpful, but not necessary.  This recipe lived up to its name.",

We served it with a wasabi soy mixture to dip the pieces into.  My only recommendation would be to use parmesan flavored bread crumbs or a mixture of parmesan cheese and bread crumbs because the coating can be a bit dry.  It takes practice to get the searing talent down to a science, but once you do you will want to wow your friends with this fancy and inexpensive recipe all the time!",
