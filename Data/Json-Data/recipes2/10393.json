We loved the after burn that follows the chocolate taste. I used Dark Hershey's Cocoa powder instead of regular because that is what I had on hand. If you have the Dark Chocolate or wish to experiment with the recipe by making the substitute of dark for the regular you will be totally thrilled at the extra chocolate richness of this dessert.",
