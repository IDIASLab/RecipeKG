I've tried many veggie dips and have liked them (like Barefoot Contessa's is very good or Beau Monde, etc) but this one is just the right combination, I think.  I used KNORR mixes for both the Onion and the Leek soups and surprisingly found it not to be overly salty...AND it's something you can keep the ingredients on hand for AND throw together easily...AND it's liked with veggies AND chips.  One of my friends, grabbed the dip off the buffet and brought it to the table where we were eating to keep everyone from having to get up to get more.  That should tell you something right there.  As far as prep...I increased the dill to probably 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons and just a FYI you might not think about (I didn't)...this dip does have to sit for a bit (i.e. chill) not just for flavor but because you need the crunchy components of the soup to soften. I made it at 3p and we ate it at 7p and it was fine. EDIT: As much as I like this dip, I did find that finding the leek soup mix became a bit of a challenge.",
