I made them for our Christmas party & they were the first things gone - and the garlic makes them so tasty, I don't know how anyone could rate them as bland! Instead of cloves of garlic, I used the fresh crushed garlic from the local grocer. I tried them the wrapped way & it was a bit time consuming, so the second batch I simply cut the phyllo into squares & put them in small muffin tins, put in the cheese & topped with the mushroom/garlic mixture. If your squares are big enough, you can still pinch the tops together, but even the ones we left open were beautiful & just as tasty. Will definitely make again and again!",

I rolled them out a little bit flatter than they come originally and with a pizza cutter made small 3\" squares. I put a small cube of brie (after freezing for about 20 minutes and cutting off the rind)onto the square 1/2 teaspoon of the mushroom mix and sealed the triangle. I made them yesterday froze them and put them in ziplock bags for my party next week. I baked a couple to test them and they're super yummie. I was afraid the garlic would be a bit much but it's perfect. Thanks for this recipe!",

It was my attempt to impress the two men were staying in the same hospital room and their very Turkish and Greek families (with the typical grandmas who cook huge amounts of food for everyone) but we greedily finished them in the other room because they were so good we didn't want to share!:) I used sliced gouda cheese (one half slice on the bottom of the mushroom and one half on top) and regular button mushrooms because the shop was closed on Sunday but they were still amazingly tasty. Be sure you roll or fold them tightly or else they 'leak' cheese and it gets hard on the baking tray. Mine took about 30 minutes in the oven and I forgot to turn them over but didn't notice at all until I re-read the recipe just now.:P I've never flipped byrek and it's always been fine. I used pre-cut triangle-shaped phyllo dough and it worked well- a different shape but still tasted the same. Just a little more awkward to butter since I was taught in Albania never to let two pieces of dry phyllo dough touch each other.:) I'll certainly try this again with other vegetables and cheese as a way to use up leftover veg and the huge amount of phyllo dough that you get in one pack!:)",
