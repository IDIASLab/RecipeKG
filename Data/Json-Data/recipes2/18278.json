I reduced the mustard in half and I think I actually could have reduced it further with 1 tablespoon total. I will use sliced green onion the next time too. Come to think of it a few more cherries would be nice also......maybe as a garnish. Make sure you make ahead and chill to blend flavors. I served this over romaine with a handfull of candied pecans to garnish. Thanks CHARISMOM this was very good and is going into my salad rotation.",
