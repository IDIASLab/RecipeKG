No changes made other than to reduce the quantity served. What I enjoy the most is the herbs can be adjusted to taste add more for extra heat or less for a milder palette. I have only ever used anchovy fillets but do like how the anchovy paste dissolved it is rather salty so just remember you can always add more so go sparingly adjusting to taste.",
