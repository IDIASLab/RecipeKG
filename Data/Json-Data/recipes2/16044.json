I omitted the peas and mushrooms and sliced up two small zucchini instead. I used frozen corn instead of canned. And I used a teaspoon of Italian seasoning instead of the bay leaf and thyme.

I also took many liberties with this recipe but since I followed the main idea of this recipe it deserves the credit. I cooked some chopped bacon in the bottom of a large pot then cooked 1/4 of a med white onion chopped (replaced shallot bc I had the onion on hand already and wanted to use up the last of it) the garlic and some diced raw carrots I had. I cut my sausage into quarter circles about 1/2\" thick and put those in the pot to brown. I added a can of diced tomatoes some leftover spaghetti sauce (maybe about 1/3 c.) and whatever frozen veggies I could dig out of my freezer. Peas corn green beas broccoli cauliflower and spinach. I thawed and strained the spinach most of the way. I like the taste of spinach so I did leave it somewhat moist and it added a nice flavor. I added the green onions last and then seasoned with a large bay leaf italian seasoning sea salt and pepper. I simmered everything for about 10 or 15 minutes until all the veggies were warmed through and some of the liquid had cooked off. I decided to not do this in the oven because I didn't want to risk overcooking the vegetables. I liked the addition of the spinach and would recommend it. Served over white rice. Wouldn't have thought to make a goulash like this. Very tasty.",

Too much crushed pepper!\" I actually reduced the red pepper and still this was fiery so alas the kid (as well as the adults) did NOT love this. Also I'm at a loss as to why this went into the oven and was referred to as a casserole. Simmering in the skillet was... well the same thing that came out of another dish to wash that was in the oven. Besides using less red pepper I also only had 8 oz. of smoked sausage so I subbed the other half w/ sliced squash. I also used fresh mushrooms and thyme so I lightly-sauteed the mushrooms w/ the onion garlic and squash. The only positive qualities of this meal were that it was colorful and the smoked sausage was tasty. I wouldn't even know where to start w/ revamping the leftovers so I'm sad to say that they'll be tossed.",
