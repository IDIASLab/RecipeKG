For the salsa I used some leftover homemade tomatilla salsa...wonderful - can't wait to make it again.",

The topping is rather flavorless and serves only to keep the fish kind of \"wet.\" A sauce should enhance the food it accompanies not dominate or bury it. Some ideas to improve this would be to bake grill or broil the fish separately then serve the sauce on the side. As for the sauce itself it needs some flavor additions - chile powder jalapeno or bell peppers maybe?",

The only positive thing that I can say about this recipe was that the fish was moist. I may try this recipe again with some changes as my husband seemed to like it. Suggestions: I would suggest reducing the general amount of marinade/sauce mixture as it thinned out considerably when it cooked and didn't seem to reconstitute even with resting. It seemed to work better as a 'leftovers' dish. I added some roasted garlic onions and julienned red bell peppers. Next time I would also leave out the butter as the recipe seemed to call for an awful lot of it and it didn't seem to really help the overall outcome. I would also suggest using this as a marinade rather than a sauce. The next time I make this I am going to try it 'en papiotte'. I am hoping that the next time this will be a more successful dish. I am willing to give it another try.",
