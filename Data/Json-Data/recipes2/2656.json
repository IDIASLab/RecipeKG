The middle however wasn't very flavorful. Not sure if it was the cheese choice or the 2 cans of celery soup instead of the typical chicken soup...maybe the lack of onion...I don't know. I'd make it again tho but spread it out in a bigger tray/pan to get it all crispy-yum:)",

It\u2019s quite a saucy dish, with strong sour cream flavor.  I might decrease sour cream next time. I wish it had gotten more crispy so might broil at end or cook at 400 next time.",
