We usually cook our burgers to about a medium doneness but I knew with the addition of the onions they would need more time to cook. Even well done they were very juicy. I did find that the meat needed some salt so I will add that next time to enhance the flavors. These would probably be really good if you mixed the meat early in the day in order for the flavors to blend.",
