Novice or beginner cooks will appreciate this recipe as it is so ideal and instructional.  Good for you and good tasting too, packed with healthy carbs, protein, dairy and a little fat, you know you're doing your body good.  I made only one real change to the recipe...I use olive oil for just about everything, but never with eggs so I used butter instead.   I added salt and pepper, didn't measure anything precisely, and used a colorful mix of orange, yellow, green and red bell peppers.  I served this with \"Crispy Mashed Potato Pancake,\" also from this site.",

However next time I will revert to my standard recipe which does not include milk and differs in several other significant ways. I know that many use milk in scrambled eggs but I prefer mine less fluffy. I also use avocado which I feel makes a major contribution and I often use more tomato which makes it a bit more like one of the staple tomato and egg dishes served regularly in many parts of China. I also replace roughly half of the eggs with tofu which makes it much more healthful both because of the health benefits of tofu and the reduction in cholesterol. I also add spinach which I buy fresh but freeze for later cooking when it starts to deteriorate. Unlike others who have reviewed this dish I prefer olive oil for cooking eggs (even for fried eggs) both for taste and health reasons. I used to use butter (and even bacon drippings before that) but olive oil is far more healthful. I usually use sharp cheddar cheese but next time I will try feta as another reviewer suggested. Fresh cilantro is also a nice addition and if you add cumin it makes a tasty breakfast wrap (in a flour tortilla). For wraps you can add shrimp or sausage for extra flavor.",
