I doubled the recipe, added about a cup a shredded Sharp Cheddar cheese, added 2 eggs and baked it in a 9x13\" pan. The pan was VERY full. It needed to cook a little longer than prescribed: took an hour. BTW, I read prevous reviews and halved the butter; so 1 stick for a double recipe. Used a sweet corn bread mix (Jiffy) and it turned out slightly sweet almost a dessert but definitely not. Anyway thanks for posting a recipe I didn't need to fool with too much and I'll definitely be making this one again soon!!!",
