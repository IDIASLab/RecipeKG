I have read many recipes and learned how many different versions there are. I used this one as a basis. I halfed the recipe for 2 with lots of leftovers! I used a bottom crust only and that was a pizza dough placed in my Pampered Chef stone deep dish pie pan, prebaked for 5 minutes. I used 15 oz of riccotta, 3 eggs, 1/2 lb. cappacola, 1/4 lb. hard salami, a big handful of pepperoni, chopped, 4 hard cooked eggs, chopped, 1 cup mozzarela cheese, 1/4 lb. provalone and a good shake or 2 of parmesan cheese, garlic powder and Italian seasoning. This was so good and it will become an Easter weekend tradition for us, even though i am Irish!! I served this with a Cesar Salad.",

I used one pound ground turkey instead of all that pork to which I added the onion garlic pepper mix. To the cheese mixture I added italian seasoning cumin and paprika. I mixed the meat mixture with the cheese as per the recipe. But I made it crustless so I just put it all into one 9 x 13 lasagne pan sprinkled the parmesan and then baked it as instructed. It came out as a very pretty meat pie. Thanks!",
