First of all it wasn't very pumpkin-y or pumpkin pie-ish just cool-whipish so I ended up trippling the pumpkin pie spice and adding some extra cinnamon. Second of all there was wayyy more than what was needed to fill a pie shell what a waste. Finally after waiting for it to set in the fridge for a few hours I had to scoop it out of the shell and add another package of pudding to thicken it to make it pie or even pudding consistency. Sorry won't be making this again.",
