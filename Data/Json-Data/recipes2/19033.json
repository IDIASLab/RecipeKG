I must have a Muse because this is better than my cornbread has ever been.  If your pumpkin is on the wet side, reduce the buttermilk a bit. It's a good idea to let the batter sit 10 to 20 minutes before baking to soften the cornmeal. This can also be baked in a greased cake pan (9-inch square) at 400 degrees F.",
