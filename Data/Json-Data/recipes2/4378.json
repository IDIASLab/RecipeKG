In the south, you can buy cracklins in the refrigerated meats section of the store.  If that's not available to you, buy a bag of snacking pork rinds and crumble into small bits yielding about 1/4-1/2 cup and mix it in the batter.   If you're a \"purist,\" you can use 1/4 cup Crisco or other \"solid\" shortening in place of the oil; just cut it into the dry cornmeal until you have small crumble results and then add other ingredients.  This is my favorite kind of cornbread! Goes great with pinto beans, black-eyed peas, turnip or mustard or collard greens, or chili.",

The density and lack of sugar are not so detracting as the lack of salt or any other flavoring in this recipe. It reminds me a little of the modern \"depression era\" bread recipes that leave out salt as if it were so dear as to be unaffordable... which I doubt was really the case except in the most severely poor homes. Some other reviews suggest adding sugar or baking powder or all-purpose flour. That really would change the recipe too dramatically and take away from the simple charm of this \"southern\" cornbread. I would suggest adding a teaspoon of salt. It maintains the spirit of this all-corn southern bread but makes it palatable. If you want a slightly fluffier cornbread meringue the egg by beating vigorously to froth before mixing with other ingredients. What the poor southern cook might have lacked in ingredients they could make up with elbow-grease.",
