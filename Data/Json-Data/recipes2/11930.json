Made per recipe the salt is waaaay too much.",

I don't care for the chili powder, but the cilantro was certainly a unique addition. I think the sauce is key. As this is more a take on a Tex-Mex meatball, I think the sauce should be less Italian. Maybe an enchilada style sauce. Not a recipe I would repeat.",
