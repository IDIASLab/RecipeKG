I used Florida\u2019s Natural Most pulp orange juice.  Threw the OJ and frozen pineapple in a blender and gave it a whirl.  Was almost sorbet in the blender.  I suggest putting it in a pre cooled or frozen container immediately and right into the freezer.  If it melts first it will become ice. Fantastic flavor!",

I tested the fruit before adding and they both seemed sweet, although the oranges were obviously not as much as the pineapple.  After freezing for the designated amount of time, what I ended up with was a rock-hard brick with the two fruits separating in layers.  Once I had hacked a piece off, I discovered that it wasn't even as sweet as what the two fruits put together should yield; instead I got a sour taste which couldn't be drowned out by the pineapple.  I'm glad I didn't try to serve this to company!  The idea is good and maybe it would improve with sweetening.  Considering the price of fresh fruit lately, I don't think I will take the chance of finding out.",
