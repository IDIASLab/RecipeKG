Mine took about 30 minutes of baking time before resting/cooling for 10 minutes. Great recipe that I will be using again! Thanks CCM for sharing your recipe. It is a keeper!",

You do have to watch them if they aren't all exactly the same thickness, otherwise some will burn, so I just removed them as they started to brown.  They turned out perfectly crispy!
