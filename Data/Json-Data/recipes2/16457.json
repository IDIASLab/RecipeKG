GREAT results. I think it needed the extra stuffing to bind up the wet ingredients and make them keep their shape. Once you take the mixture out of the fridge to make the balls give it a good stir to really get the wet ingredients mold-able. The flavor is great. Really delicious and a big hit with my family.",

I only made them because I had half a box of stuffing that needed using up, but they are SO good that I'm going to make them for Thanksgiving dinner next week (and plenty of other times too)! The only changes I made were to use extra-sharp Cheddar (I mistakenly thought I had Parm), and also fresh brocc (I can't stand the frozen stuff). Although they were pretty easy to form into balls, you could easily just spread the mixture in a dish, and bake as directed. I'm also thinking of making them with broccoli and cauliflower. This is a fantastic recipe. Thanks so much, Heather!",

This time out I subbed the parmesan for sharp cheddar which was yummy. My only concern is that they were to \"egg-y\" Next time less egg adn butter. I'll also be sauteeing the onion and experimenting with adding various seasonings and possibly sauteed mushroom. The flavor was OK it just seemed to be missing something. I think these are a great nibbler I just want to tweak them to be a bit more flavorful.",

I saved myself a dish and some time by just covering the frozen broccoli in a large bowl w/ saran wrap and microwaved for 7 minutes then let it drain and cool in a collander while I mixed the ingredients in that same large bowl. I used 16 oz. of chopped broccoli 3/4 cup Parmesan and 1.5 pkgs. of the stuffing but kept the eggs and margarine the same. I subbed 1/4 cup dried minced onions and did garlic powder not garlic salt at 3/4 tsp. I made the balls slightly larger so I ended up with 26 total. Everyone at a potluck gobbled them up and one person asked for the recipe. For something that looks like \"nothing special \" it sure turns out great.",
