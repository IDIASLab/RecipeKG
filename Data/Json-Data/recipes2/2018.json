Especially considering the unusual, and borderline disturbing name. Sometimes called German pancakes, these have very little to do with Germany, and nothing to do with the Dutch. Apparently they were invented by German immigrants who were referred to as Dutch.",

I make batter night before, pour into Tupperware water pitcher (makes pouring into each muffin tin much easier) and refrigerate.  Don't open oven door to check as they are baking, use your oven light to watch them puff up. My ingredients are a little different.....I use 1 cup flour, 1 cup milk, 4 eggs and 1/4 tsp. salt.

My recipe calls for 1/2 cup milk instead of 2/3 cup; I use 1 tsp. vanilla instead of 1/4 tsp.; and I bake it at 400\u00b0, but will try these suggested variations.  I like lots more lemon than suggested; the last time I made it I added 1 tsp. lemon zest to the batter, and next time I\u2019ll add more.  As far as this recipe serving four, I eat this entire pancake by myself and use the juice of at least two lemons.  \n\nThe German word for German is \u201cdeutsch,\u201d which was corrupted into English as \u201cDutch,\u201d and thus mistakenly interpreted as referring to Holland.  (The equally misinterpreted \u201cPennsylvania Dutch\u201d are of German ancestry).  So this is a \u201cdeutsch pancake,\u201d meaning a German Pancake (note the reviewer who mentions Bavaria).  The term \u201cDutch Baby\u201d usually refers to a smaller individual serving (such as a muffin tin size) of this German Pancake instead of to an entire skillet full.",

With quite a bit of trial and error, here is what you need to get a nice big puff:\n\nWarm the eggs-- they need to be room temp. I place refrigerated eggs into warm water for about half an hour.\n\nWarm the milk-- I nuke it for about 45 seconds. Not enough to cook the eggs, but a bit more than room temp. \n\nMixing-- I use a hand mixer. Perhaps a blender will work, but you need to really mix it in a specific way. First, whip the eggs well. Slowly add the milk, again ensuring that the mixture is well whipped. Add the vanilla, then slowly add the flour. The goal is for the batter to be as airy as possible. \n\nBaking-- I warm the cast iron pan for a few minutes, allow the butter to melt, swirl it around, then pour the batter in. \n\nWith these steps, I get puffs of around 6 inches, which really makes the pancake. Enjoy!",

It's an absolute family favourite and we have it for lunch of breakfast, even sometimes a quick supper!  Mine I an double or triple.  For each beten egg, I use 1Tbsp. flour and 2 Tbsp. milk.  Sometimes I top it with peeled, chopped apples that have been cooked in butter, about 1Tbsp. rasins that I've plumped a bit in hot water and drained and about 1 Tbs. sugar, some cinnamon, nutmeg and a bit of ground cloves.  I prepare this while the \"omelette\" is in the oven.  Don't overcook the apple mixture, they should retain their shape and just be getting soft and nicely glazed with the butter, sugar and spice mixture.   You could use dried cranberries  or other dried fruit instead of raisins.  Yum!",

BUT next time I'll try the opposite -- bake the recipe in a muffin tin, sprinkle on the lemon and sugar and fill with fruit salad topped with yoghurt/whipped cream.  Voila, super simple and stunning holiday breakfast!\nUpdate: these are awesome baked in muffin tins - just remember they are done in about 1/2 the time.\n\nThis is also a forgiving recipe: the eggs and milk weren't at room temp, the butter not clarified -- and they still turned out puffy, with just the right eggy texture -- sort of like the inside of a crueller.",
