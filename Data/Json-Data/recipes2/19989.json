This makes a lot and for us the dressing wasn't enough as written. I made another half batch and thought it could have used even more but the next day it was just right. The flavor of the fennel was mild and not at all overpowering. I ran it through a food processor with the slicer attachment to get it nice and thin. Overall a good salad--I like it with a sprinkle of sea salt.",

I love fresh tarragon, so I did add more of it to the tasty dressing. I sliced my fennel bulb on the mandolin, but I didn\u2019t use the thinnest setting, and I will do that the next time.  It was just a little chewy, so would suggest slicing as thinly as possible. I could see adding shrimp to this for an entree.  Nice lunch, nice presentation, and it was enjoyed",
