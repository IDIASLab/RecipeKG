I liked also how less greasy it was than restaurant fajitas making it more healthy in my opinion. The peppers and onions had such a nice flavor. It didn't say, but I sliced the chicken tenderloins into 1/2-1\" sized slices. For ease, I used a partially defrosted bag of Trader Joes sliced mixed colored peppers. I had about 3/4 of a 16 oz bag left and it worked well. I will try it with fresh in the summer though. I also used Trader Joes homemade brand tortillas which I briefly warmed in the microwave. Instead of cooking everything all at once I first crisped the chicken in the oil after it got nice and hot on temperature 7. Then layered the sliced onions on top until they softened and lastly the peppers and seasoning. The peppers were a little watery due to not being fresh but the chicken and onions were golden in color by that point anyway. I thought the seasonings had the right balance. I got about 6 chicken fajitas. I am going to put this in my box of meals for regular rotation. ty",

The recipe did not seem like it would have a lot of flavor so I doubled the cumin and added sour cream and avocado to mine. This is a great quick lunchtime meal. It is a very easy recipe to follow and prepare. I felt like I was doing class one from the AllRecipes Cooking School. This is great for knife skills and mise-en-place practice. ?I think in the future I would marinade the chicken for a few hours prior to cooking and grill everything rather than saute it for extra flavor.  Grilling the veggies gives them a LOT more flavor! #?AllstarsMazola?",

I thought 1 tsp of oregano was too much. We are used to more spice in the fajita mix I make so we had to add hot sauce and spicy salsa to enjoy these. I agree with bd.weld that these seasonings would probably taste better with steak. Mine came out a little watery. I added the chicken and veggies to the oil at the same time as the recipe states. I usually saute the peppers and onions a bit before adding the chicken which I think helps get rid of some of that water from the veggies.",
