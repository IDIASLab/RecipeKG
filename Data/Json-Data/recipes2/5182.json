I did change a couple things I replaced the red wine vinegar with red wine but still used the balsamic vinegar. I also cooked a bit differently letting the sauce simmer without the spinach for about 20 minutes. I then added the fresh spinach into the sauce right before my noodles were done just basically stirred it into the simmering sauce until well wilted this way we could really taste the full robust flavor of the spinach. I like the tartness the balsamic vinegar gives the sauce but glad I used the red wine or it might have been too tart for my taste. The feta was a great topping for this dish but hubs insisted on Parmesan cheese on his I took a taste of his and like the feta much better. Thanks hokiemom for a new dish for our meatless Mondays...this one is a keeper in our house.",
