Because miso paste is salty enough I used just 1 tbs soy sauce. 1/2 cup butter was enough for me too. And I don t care for ginger so much so used just a little. The sauce goes great on anything even as a salad dressing (I had leftovers and used it this way).",

Too acidic with the lime juice AND white wine. And too salty with both miso and soya. All I could taste was \"bright\" and \"acid\" and \"salty\" with no warmth even after adding the butter. I notice that most other positive reviews used salmon...maybe that oil would help to counter the brightness of the sauce but not for pork. I was embarrassed to serve this to my wife. I was looking forward to cooking this all week but had to file this one under \"not again.\" Maybe with some tweaks like using a miso paste with the sirchimi and sesame instead of in the sauce and using only one acidic ingredient (wine) it might be good. I made this as written except added only a little soya into the sauce.",
