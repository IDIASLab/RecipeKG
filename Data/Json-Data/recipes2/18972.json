I bought the famous red and white can of Cheddar Cheese Soup (I should know better canned soup recipes never work for me) and made the recipe as written. It didn't taste good. I added more beer more worchestershire sauce still not good. I put in more cayenne some grated extra sharp cheddar and still no. The cheese soup seemed to swallow everything I put in it and kill the flavors. Finally I put in some garlic powder and some dijon mustard and that made it taste not so bad (but not like Welsh Rarebit). I put some on toast with LOTS of grated extra sharp cheddar and broiled it until bubbly. I ate it but next time I'll stick with J of C and the double boiler.",

My biggest disappointment with this recipe is that it was VERY soupy literally more like soup than Rarebit. When poured over anything it immediately soaked in and spread all over the plate.",
