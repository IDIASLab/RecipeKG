To that I added the dried parsley romano cheese as well as some parmesan garlic powder italian seasoning basil and oregano. I didn't measure just eyeballed it and mixed it up. I used two eggs and thinned that out with a bit of milk. I didn't bother with the flour either. I cut the chicken breasts into smaller pieces and dipped them into the egg then the bread crumb mixture then back into the egg and back into the bread crumb mixture (double dipping) for a thick coating. I sprayed a glass baking pan with Pam so nothing would stick and baked it for 35 minutes at 350 turning once during baking. The chicken was very moist and had a great italian herb flavor.",

The directions seemed fussy for this type of recipe too. Far simpler to bake uncovered at 425\u00ba for 25 minutes. I'll stick to using a very thin coating of low-fat mayo (instead of the egg) and a more seasoned crumb coating recipe. I do appreciate the use of flax seed meal in this recipe though. I will add flax seed to my usual recipe. Thanks for that:)",
