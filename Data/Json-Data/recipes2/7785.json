I added garlic, salt, and crushed red pepper to the sauce and I can't imagine how bland it would have been w/out them.  I did have to sub dried for fresh herbs when the fresh I'd purchased didn't last until it was time to (finally) make this.  However, while they would have brightened the dish, a bit, they wouldn't have made a marked improvement.  If you like blander food (and many do, that's not a \"knock\", at all), this is certainly worth trying.  THANKS for the recipe!",
