I have never quite melted white chocolate as long as directed, though, but keep an eye on it because it burns quicker than other chocolates. I also add a tsp. of vegetable oil, or so after it is melted, to help with coating. Then, refridgerate the finished cookies to harden. The kids really liked these.",

Here is a helpful hint in response to some of the negative comments; instead of miniature white choc chips, use white \"coating\" choc chips.  They are designed for recipes like this and, unlike white choc chips, they do not contain cocoa butter which makes them much easier to work with.  Hope this helps.",
