        "description": "Making cheese crackers at home may sound daunting but actually they are quite easy. They require a little more work, then they're worth it. Crackers don't need to be an afterthought. These particular crackers are definitely worthy of their own place on your menu. No weird ingredients or fancy kitchen gadgets needed. You only need some ingredients that you probably have in your kitchen all the time, a cookie cutter, and an oven. That's all! These are super crispy, buttery, and perfect for a snack but if topped and loaded with cheese and herbs, ideal as a side dish.",
