First with the pork my cuts were a little thicker than suggested because I decided to do more of a slow simmered pork. The pork chops did not finish cooking through properly with the given time so my solution was to up the sauce amount. There was not much of a sauce with just the wine and cream so I added 1 cup of chicken stock and added back the seared pork for about 15 more minutes on medium low till the pork was cooked through and the sauce was thickened. I served this with egg noodles and broccoli and it rounded out the meal beautifully! Note: with the sauce add a little water if the it thickens to much or you want more. With my way compared to others opinions on the Dijon is mellowed out A LOT with the addition of the liquids and simmering. 1 teaspoon was plenty!",
