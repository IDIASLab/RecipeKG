I added a little bit of cinnamon and a small amount of salt to the dry ingredients. When I was mixing the wet into the dry, it was too dry (I didn't reallly measure the PB so that might be why), so I added some chicken broth that I had. I did use the honey. I baked them in small aluminum pie pans that are for chicken pot pies. They were perfectly baked in the 40 minutes. My husband decided to try a piece to see what it tasted like and he really liked it. He kept feeding one piece to the dog and one piece to himself hahahaha. I will definitely make this in the future for the pups!!",
