Because I have one step-daughter that only eats chicken or fish, I separated some of the sauce into two bags; one for pork and one for 2 chicken breasts. She gave me one of the best compliments she ever has in the last year for my cooking: 'It is fine-dining quality.'",

I made it with pan fried kale with garlic and put it on a bed of couscous...I drizzled remainder of the marinade from the bottom of the pan over the meat...it combined with the couscous beautifully. My partner loved the dish and is already asking me to make it again. My only regret is that we were so hungry we forgot to take a picture to share!!!! Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!",

The marinade is very sweet and only the sweetness and a hint of garlic came through. I was very surprised that the sesame oil and the horseradish were completely lost. That can be adjusted because DH and DS really liked the flavor. The tenderloin was moist and juicy. I see the author describes this dish as \"grilled\" but it was pan-roasted. I followed the directions and I was happy to try this method since I have only done stovetop with medallions. Thanks for the idea.",
