I added a few things, which turned it into a mega-lasagna, or The Lasagna That Ate New York. I used a pound of lump crab, bay scallops, and shrimp in separate layers. I also added a layer of ricotta cheese mixed with a couple of beaten eggs.  For the sauce I took the water I used to boil the shrimp, added a little white wine, and reduced it to about one cup.  I started the sauce with the butter/flour roux, gradually added milk, shrimp reduction, and half-and-half. I also added Old Bay seasoning, paprika, a few dashes of Tabasco, and some basil.  Total liquid was approximately five cups, but I was making a big lasagna. I added the grated parmesan to the sauce last. I layered in this order between the pasta: crabmeat, ricotta, scallops, shrimp.  The scallops were small so I did not need to pre-cook them. It's important to let this rest 15-20 minutes after removing from the oven so your lasagna squares will hold together when serving. This made a fantastic dinner with garlic bread and a mixed green & romaine salad. Thanks for making everyone happy at the dinner table!",

The sauce was bland as written but really something with salt pepper garlic powder and Emeril's Essence added.
