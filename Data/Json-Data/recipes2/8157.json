I sent one with him and kept one for myself. The only change I made was keeping the dressing separate from  the chicken, added a little Dijon mustard, and putting  the dressing in the jar first.  To keep apples from turning brown, I will chop them up and soak them in a lemon-lime soda for a few minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!",
