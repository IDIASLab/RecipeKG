I used diced tomato, grated Parmesan cheese from a bottle and shrimp that I had just peeled. One thing I did was cut the shrimp into bite size chunks and I dropped it into the boiling water for the pasta for about 45 seconds, then I put it off to the side until I was ready to use it in the sauce. Also, I used Moscato instead of regular white wine. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe!",
