Glad I did however my grocery store in my itty bitty town did not have dry Udon noodles so I opted for the premade Udon Ramen in the produce cold salad section where I found the wonton and egg roll wrappers. It was quicker to put together and I just tossed the flavor packet aside for another use later. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. I found it slightly to bitter with nutty taste. So Thankfully I had my mom tell me to add about 2-3 drops of sesame oil and about 3 TBSPs more of the chicken broth. It worked and was to our liking. It was gone in a flash with no leftovers. I will make again with the addition that I did and will make our table quite often! TY",

Sauce turned sticky quickly so added even more broth until it was more creamy/liquid to make it a nicer consistency. The cilantro and green onion are a must to make it more flavorful. Kids and husband approved! Added cayenne pepper to my plate. Will make again with shrimp!",
