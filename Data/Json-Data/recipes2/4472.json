It has the standard ingredients of eggs, cheese, and hash brown potatoes seen in most breakfast casseroles. However, it is a fusion of different spices from cuisines around the world which are added to the traditional American breakfast casserole. It can be made ahead, refrigerated overnight, and then put in the oven the next morning. Add bacon, sausage, or ham for a hearty breakfast dish.",
