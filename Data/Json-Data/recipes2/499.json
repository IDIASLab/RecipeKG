First thing.. the mashed banana took longer than the recipe states to get any color o plan accordingly. It was also pretty difficult to brown as it was mashed up.. I didnt pulverize it but it get very loose when heated in the oil. I liked the idea of caramelizing the bananas but I think slicing them and using less oil might be better.. at least for me. The banana did form little delicious clumps with the cereal when mashed though...",
