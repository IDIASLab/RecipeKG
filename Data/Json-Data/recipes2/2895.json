To the reader asking about adding water, No I just melted the cheese, cream of chicken soup and butter together and then poured over the broccoli and threw it in the over. I used garlic flavored ritz style cracker because that is all I had.  This has to be the easiest dish next to green bean casserole. Good luck and enjoy",

Place in a casserole dish top with Veggie flavored crushed rounds.  I use the butter to drizzle on top and bake for 15 to 20 minutes.  Perfect!!  Thanks for this recipe!",

This was one of the dishes I was assigned to bring to our dinner today. After choosing this one I made a trial run of it for dinner last night. Everyone loved it!! Even my 2 yr old Granddaughter who as everyone knows 2yr olds don't like many veggies lol. The only things I changed was I used Chopped Broccoli (easier for my Granddaughter to eat) & the topping. My family loves the Durky Dried Onions so I topped it with those instead and spritzed them with a little butter. Perfect!! Tysm for sharing this quick & simple recipe!!",
