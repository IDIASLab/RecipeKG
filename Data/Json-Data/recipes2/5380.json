The cranberry is a great pop of color and goes great with the brie and salty pretzels. I think it could use a bit of a kick with chipotle peppers mixed in. Next time I am going to try strawberry jam or pepper jelly. I think this is an excellent base and can be made with a variety of toppings instead of or in addition to the cranberry sauce. It was a hit with my crew!",
