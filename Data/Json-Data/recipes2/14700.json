One thing I didn't realize was how soft the ice cream needed to be before you put it in the pie crust. It was almost melted but when I tried to spread it, the crust cracked. For the second layer I stirred the melty ice cream in a separate bowl before I added it to the pie. Much easier to spread. If you love ice cream, you should definitely make this.",

Everyone loved this recipe - adults and children!  A couple of alterations were needed: 1) It takes longer than 15 minutes to freeze each layer - probably at least 30 minutes.  2)  Be sure the 1st layer of ice cream is extra soft, but not liquidy, so that the crust doesn't break apart and stick to the ice cream.  3) Don't use too much not fudge, or it over takes the pie.  This is very easy - a definite keeper!",
