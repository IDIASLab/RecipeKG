The dressing makes 19 Tbsp and 6 Tbsp (1.5 Tbsp per serving) is plenty of dressing for 4 so I cut the dressing in half reducing the pepper by half again. Will definitely make this again.

I can't even imagine how acrid/vinegary this would be if prepared with the 1:1 oil to vinegar ratio!  Perfection is 3:1 oil to vinegar and that's what I made.  I also used grilled artichokes rather than those packed in water, but artichokes are so delicious any kind would do. I also used fresh shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano.  What a shame this recipe HAS to be criticized for its dressing when it is so easily corrected.  Four stars, for sure, if prepared using a well-balanced oil and vinegar dressing.",

My husband had 3 helpings and 7 year old son had 3 plus he finished the rest of mine. I did make a couple of minor changes though. I took out the onions since my family does not like them and added a ripe vine tomato. I also used apple cider vinegar and olive oil instead of what the recipe called for. For the salad mix I used Romaine lettuce. I will make this again at least once a week.",
