Looked like a fun and tasty recipe so tried it today using Aidell's chicken and apple sausages as those were on hand and hot dogs were not. They come four to a package and are pretty large. Sauteed just a few minutes in a skillet first then halved each one to fit the crescent roll. Something wasn't quite right with the crescent rolls as they didn't cut easily into triangles as they always have previously plus it was not so easy to wrap as suggested. Baked as directed but found the dough not quite done enough so next time will bake according to package directions which is 375 for 9-12 mins. Thank you for an interesting fun Halloween treat.",
