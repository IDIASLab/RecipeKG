Delicious, especially served with some grilled chicken, steak, or shrimp!",

I'm always looking for a way to make zucchini since I love it so much and this did the trick.  It tasted like something out of a Japanese restaurant.  I did add several cloves of fresh chopped garlic since I don't make anything especially veggies without it, but the rest kept the same.  My teen even liked it.  Thankyou and I hope more people try this recipe, it's so worth it.",
