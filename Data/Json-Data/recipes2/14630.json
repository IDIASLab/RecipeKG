The other version from this site was good but hard and expensive to make. I used the instant pudding and then used my mixer to avoid clumps. Perfect consistency and yummy. I topped it with peanut butter chips and drizzled with chocolate syrup. Done in 15 mins tops. I also used a chocolate crust. Now she wants me to make it for every month for her good school work reward!!! I made this for less then 5 awesome on tight budgets!",

I used the sugar free instant vanilla pudding mixed slightly with the 1 3/4 cup milk (amount for a pie) and then added (whisked) in the peanut butter (I microwaved for about 25 seconds- melted but not hot). I did use a granola crust but definitely thinking a chocolate crust would be great. Really needs some color on top- chocolate syrup fudge sauce ganache peanut butter cups- something - especially when using graham crust otherwise it's too \"plain\" looking. It does have a richness but it's so much better than I expected!",
