I cut the measurements in half and reduced the oil to 1 cup based on other reviews and still had plenty of marinade for 50 large prawns. Also cut the salt/pepper to 1tsp each. And I cut out the oregano wanting the cilantro to shine. It was so easy and made the shrimp so tasty. We grilled instead of sauteeing them and it was a huge hit!",

This already has lime & vinegar so I reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon and reduced the oil to just 2 tablespoons. With those modifications, I was still left with lots of marinade left over, which I simply cooked and poured over some white rice. Very tasty!! ",

Cut the salt in HALF both the seasoned salt and regular salt and cut WAY back on most of the other ingredients like maybe in half. This recipe was designed for about 3 pounds of shrimp. If you like the sweet and sour thing then you may like this. I accidantally made this instead of a regular \"tequila shrimp\" and it was NOT what I was expecting because I just simply selected the wrong recipe. Eh write it off to a learning experience.",
