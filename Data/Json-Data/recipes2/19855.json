Adding a 6 oz. package of jello would not be good it would be gritty and would not set I had a friend that did that......why? Don't know there is hardly 1/4 c. of juice in a can of pineaple this size. I worried the first time I made it that there wouldn't be enough liquid. BE SURE TO NOT ADD THE WHOLE CAN OF 7up it will be runny this is too much liquid. Love this recipe! Oh and all jello recipes should be done the day before you need it don't make this in the morning and think it will be ready in the afternoon. I never do that you are playing Russian Roullette.
