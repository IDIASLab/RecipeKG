I only used about 1 liter of ginger ale and then water. They had a slightly sweet taste to them from the ginger ale which I didn't mind but my son refused to eat them. I left out the sauerkraut since hubby hates it and so I used sauteed onions and peppers. After the brats were done cooking I seared them off in a pan real quick to get the yummy crispness to them. I don't think I would do it again if I was in the same situation but it was worth a try. Thanks for the recipe.",
