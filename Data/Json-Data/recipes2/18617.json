I diced 8 oz. of fully cooked kielbasa fried it drained it and then blotted out as much grease as possible--my 1/2 lb. turned out to be 4 oz. For this amount of meat the other things I CHANGED were: used 1 medium onion 2 large carrots 2 cloves of garlic 9 oz. (by weight) of cabbage coleslaw mix and 2 cups of pre-cooked rice. This made 2 large main-dish portions that were not at all greasy. Serve it with a sweet fruit such as red grapes or cantaloupe. A very fast simple and good dinner esp. if the meat is prepared ahead of time. Yum.",

Like another reviewer I tried it with chicken and loved it that way. It would also be very good with the kielbasa. I will try it that way when I have some.
