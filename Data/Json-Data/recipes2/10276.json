This healthy alternative to oatmeal is great for anyone on a paleo diet or for people who can't process gluten. We double this recipe, place it in a 1/2-gallon Mason jar, and vacuum seal it.

It was a delicious comfort food perfect for a cold winter morning! Will definitely be making this again.",

I also used organic stevia. With my blender the texture was light and fluffy. It tastes very good and is very very filling! It would be a great base recipe on which to build and customize. I wasn't really sure about the texture at first but I have really started loving the flavor and how filling it is! I am sure there is a way to make it less fluffy but with my blender that has not been the case. I added more pecans on top for an added crunch. This recipe is a keeper. I will be making it weekly.",
