I added salt & pepper onion garlic dijon mustard worchestershire sauce & breadcrumbs (to soak up any excess juices or fat whilst cooking). I left out the onion as a filling for the burger because I already added it to the meat. Suggest you play around with the meat flavourings to get something that appeals to your taste.",

You can't talk while eating it you don't want to look at anyone else while they're eating it and you don't want anyone else to look at you!\":o) As other's have aptly noted the sheer height of this burger is overwhelming--as is its juiciness. However it has a cacophony of flavors that somehow come together to taste great. I wonder if you could combine many of the ingredients into a bit of an \"Aussie Salsa\" (pineapple tomato relish beets etc.)so the overall height was diminished. I think I'll try that next time.",

Well first of all they are completely impractical. They were literally 5 inches high--Even Mick Jagger couldn't get his mouth around that. When we pushed down the top things would squeeze out and shoot across the table. As for the taste it wasn't bad but if I did it again I'd leave off the beets egg and pineapple which leaves you with your basic bacon cheeseburger. My husband liked them better than I did.
