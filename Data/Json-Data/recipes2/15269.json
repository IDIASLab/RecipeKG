However I wanted Irish Cream Truffles when I made it the second time around. I didn't want to go out and purchase a 13 bottle of Irish Cream liqueur (we don't drink) so I decided to substitute those new flavored creamers for the heavy cream. You wouldn't believe it but it worked out so wonderfully!!! These are easy to make and it's a wonderful basic recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great basic recipe.  Anyone that complains about the taste of the chocolate is overlooking one HUGE point: If you start out with cheap chocolate you will get a truffle that tastes like cheap chocolate, or just doesn't work.  A higher quality chocolate will yield a better truffle.  Also, the less actual chocolate in the chips the more problems you will have getting them to the right consistancy.  One more point-If you don't care for bitter sweet chocolate, don't use it.  That's why there are so many varieties in the baking section.  I recommend Guittard, in my mind the best you can buy before Godiva.  Ghriradelli is good as well, but the Guittard has a richer, more European taste (since it is).  They cost a bit more, but you won't believe what you'd get!  Much cheaper than Godiva!  PS- I apologize for any spelling errors.",

If you have trouble rolling, definitely leave in the refrigerator for another hour or so.  It will make it much much easier.  Once you coat with cocoa powder, let it sit for a few minutes.

Freezing the blobby little melon-baller scoopings for a half hour and rolling with my hands after that was the only way they came anywhere close to attractive. I gave them to tons of family this Christmas and everyone loved them. (My brother in law especially he must have asked at least 4 times if I was absolutely sure they were all gone- I think he searched my fridge for good measure just in case I was holding out!)",

I made 6 different varieties, and they were all great.  I made the regular recipe, coconut with coconut extract instead of vanilla and rolled in toasted coconut, mint made with mint extract and rolled in crushed peppermint candies, almond made with vanilla extract but with toasted almonds in the chocolate and rolled in raw crushed almonds, raspberry vanilla (this variety required 1 tsp vanilla and almost 2 tsp raspberry extract), and mocha, which I made by blending some flavored coffee powder into the chocolate mixture and rolling in a blend of the coffee and cocoa powder.    A few hints: save yourself some grief and buy a chopper (I used mine for the chocolate, candies, and nuts).  Have the chocolate, cream, and extract ready before you begin melting the chocolate.  It is easiest to roll and cover the chocolate if you wait until the chocolate has set firm.  Then scoop the chocolate, warm it in your hands, and roll into ball.  Also, I was very concerned it would be difficult to get the toppings to stick- it was actually very easy for them to stick.  I hope this review helps.  It was actually kind of relaxing to make these.",
