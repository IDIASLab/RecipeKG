My dad kept saying, \"wow!\"  I read the reviews about the sauce being thin so I added about a teaspoon of flour to the warm butter to make a thin roux before adding the cream so that the sauce would be thicker.  Don't know if it made a difference but my sauce wasn't thin, it was perfect!  It makes it hard to go spend $25 for a dish at pricey seafood restaurants when it only cost me about $12 to feed 4. ***UPDATE***I have made this about half a dozen more times and now I saute a chopped shallot and a few garlic cloves, chopped, in the butter after the shrimp are done and I still add flour to make a roux before adding the cream.  Chopped parsley is another touch to make it beautiful!  This sauce is absolutely decadent!",

I saut\u00e9ed fresh minced garlic some minced shallots and the mushrooms (an exotic blend) set that aside cooked up the shrimp then added them to the mushrooms. I didn t measure anything for the sauce just melted the butter and added a full cup of cream and a glug of dry sherry and simmered it reducing it to the thickness I desired (thickening with flour or cornstarch is not necessary). Once thickened I added the shrimp/mushroom mixture. This is a rich and luscious sauce not heavily seasoned so it was ideal for the spicier blackened halibut we served it with. This was simply an excellent and elegant dish. This was one of those rare occasions where Hubs voiced his opinion before it was even asked for. This is awesome he said.",
