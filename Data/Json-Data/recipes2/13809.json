This was sort of close but not exactly. The sauce from Olive Garden does not taste like alfredo sauce and it's a different consistency. So I did an experiment. It seems like the resaturant version is something like a white wine butter cream sauce? So I followed steps one and two (the same way as written) but when it came time for the sauce I just melted butter then sauted the garlic in the melted butter then added half and half (cream) and some white wine. In my opinion this turned out much better. Very yummy!",

As many reviewers have said it's a little bland so go ahead and spice it up with some extra garlic and whatever other italian spices you prefer. Using chicken broth instead of the reserved pasta water helped add a bit more flavor. You'll definitely want to either halve the pasta or double the sauce depending on how many you're feeding. It would be much too dry as written. I'm sure homemade alfredo sauce would make this fabulous but that's more work than I'm looking for unless it's a very special occasion! Overall my family really enjoyed this dish. Even my 3 and 6 year olds cleaned their plates. Just don't expect that you're getting an exact replica of the Olive Garden's dish. If you want that head out for dinner!",
