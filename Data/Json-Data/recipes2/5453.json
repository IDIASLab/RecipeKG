That might be desirable for a special occasion serving something indulgent but not too fatty itself (lobster or tuna maybe). However, for most purposes I'd prefer a classic beurre blanc without the cream.  It was good but slightly too much for weeknight salmon and green beans, hah. \n\nAlso, choose your wine wisely. Be sure to use something very dry. I used some leftover pinot grigio and the finished sauce was a bit too sweet.",
