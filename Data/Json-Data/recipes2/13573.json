Great hot or cold...I've made this at least 10 times in the last 3 months or so, and it's always a hit.  \r\n\r\nI always substitute a big jalapeno (or 2 small ones) for the pimentos, and add a couple cloves of freshly minced garlic.  Also, I squeeze the juice of one lemon into the mix before baking.  You can substitute a bunch of chives for the green onions for extra flavor - if not, I recommend just using a small bunch of green onions, instead of just 2 TBSP of them.  If you like seafood, add a 6ox. can of flaked crabmeat - YUMMY!\r\n\r\nI always serve these with Tostitos lime flavored chips, and usually make a double-batch because it goes so quickly!
