Nice and moist, and a great consistency, and the orange zest was perfection! \nI didn't give this 5 starts as I found the instructions slightly lacking. It didn't work well at all combining the dates and cashews in the food processor together. The dates all clumped together on the side and the cashews were all at the bottom. \nI poured the two into a big bowl and went to work with my hands and this worked much better to combine the dates and cashews. \nI would definitely make these again.",
