Also, I chopped and sprinkled some assorted cheeses I had that needed to be used over the top.  The results were delicious.  This is very easy and tasty, and will be in my dinner rotation.",

The sauce in this recipe simply is not a \"Sauce\" at all in my opinion as-is. However it is a GREAT starter/base. I get that this is called ground sausage spaghetti and maybe I'm missing the point. But I'll stick with a little more liquid in the sauce for a meal called Spaghetti. That said I made this using Johnsonville mild Italian sausage and the flavor was really great. Kids loved it too. I like another commentor thought it needed much more sauce so I added a jar that I had on hand... 24oz Zia Marinara I believe but anything would work really. I also sauteed the onions and bell peppers in olive oil first until soft as well as 2 cloves of chopped fresh garlic. Then I removed the vegetables from the skillet and browned the sausage. I didn't bother to drain the sausage grease since there was basically none to drain. I added all the ingredients back into the skillet with the meat including the extra jar of sauce and allowed it to simmer on low heat for about an hour. The finished product was really really quite tasty. Thick and flavorful. Served on slightly al dente spaghetti noodles this meal was delicious and this was a sauce that will probably become a regular for me.",
