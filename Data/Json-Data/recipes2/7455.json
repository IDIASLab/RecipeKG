The only changes I did was use greek yogurt (that's what I had) and replaced one cup of the hot cereal with a mixture of almond meal millet bean flour and flax. I doubled the batch so it didn't make that much of a difference I just wanted to use up some ingredients. My one year old son enjoyed these too!",

I used ground flax instead of the flax cereal. I used coconut yogurt instead of the vanilla yogurt. I used almond milk instead of skim milk and I used whole eggs instead of egg whites. I used a half cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of the canola oil and honey. Iused walnuts instead of pecans and I sprinkled a few more blueberries on top of each muffin for added sweetness. I made 20 muffins instead of 12 and I had to bake them for longer than 20 minutes but they were pretty good! I will try them again with some of the ingredients listed when I'm not on an elimination diet!",
