                "reviewBody": "I live in Europe (have for 15 years) in a country next door to Italy where they use mascarpone cheese and phyllo dough all the time.  Maybe I can help everyone with the leakages problem.  I have never seen anyone try and make separate triangles or squares with phyllo dough.  It is always used in a pan and then cut later.  Even though I haven't tried this recipe yet, when I do, I will layer the bottom of a pan (15x11\" or 9x13\") with 3-4 sheets of phyllo (brushing the butter in between each layer).  Then spread the filling over the layers and finishing with 3-4 more sheets of phyllo brushing the butter on the top, as well.  The baking time will probably vary.  Once it's baked, let it cool completely then cut in squares or, as they like to do here, cut diagonally to the right and then the left making diamond shapes.  Hopefully, this will work.  If anyone tries this before I do, let me know how it works.  Hope this help!\nI finally tried this recipe and made it the way I suggested above (keeping the filling exactly as written).  It turned out just fine as far as the consistency and everything holding together.  But next time I will NOT add honey, but will, instead, add brown sugar and cinnamon.  One other thing, make sure you beat the mascarpone REALLY well so that it's nice and fluffy.  That will make the consistency much better.",

Next time I'd serve the phyllo dough with some of the mascarpone-chocolate mix and some mascarpone with a little sugar and vanilla mixed in as a little break from the delicious rich \"chocolatey-ness\" of the recipe. Mine weren't bitter at all and they didn't leak very much. Yummm!!! The trick is to make the chocolate mix pretty thick like a paste. Then it really shouldn't leak too badly. If you need to add more sweetening add confectioner's sugar and you should be all set! Serve with a drizzle of dark chocolate syrup and powdered sugar.:)",

(it was a bit bitter before & I didn't want to add more honey for fear of making the filling runny). Like Princess Antz most of the filling leaked out while baking (I baked @ 375 for 20 minutes & they were a perfect golden brown). Although there was enough left to be able to enjoy the dessert still....hence the 4 stars. (It would have gotten five if the filling was sweeter & most of the filling hadn't been lost). Next time I think I will try not putting so much filling in but I don't think there is anyway to seal phyllo dough so I'm thinking this recipe might be better suited in phyllo cups. The taste was excellent...there is just some issues w/ the logistics of the recipe. I drizzled each w/ a little honey & garnished w/ chocolate curls.
