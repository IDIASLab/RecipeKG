At the end there was some left and someone took a fork and just finished it off! It is so easy to make very inexpensive and obviously very popular! Like some other reviewers I just added the dressing until the consistency looked right. I'm sure that the quality of the Caesar Dressing really impacts the quality of the final product. I just used Kraft but the dressing does have a starring role so if you are picky about your Caesar Dressing then be sure to use your favorite kind. I think this would also be really good with tuna or chicken in it as more of a main dish salad for greens or sandwiches.",
