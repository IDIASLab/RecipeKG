The spices in the dressing completely took over and I didn't even taste the earthy mushroom flavor that I love. I felt like I wasted a wonderful batch of mushrooms on this since I couldn't really taste them. The flavor was pretty good maybe as a side dish with an Italian supper but not if you want to showcase the mushrooms. This recipe would be great with some quartered red potatoes instead of the mushrooms.",
