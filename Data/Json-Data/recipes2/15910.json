I ground the bologna up in a mini-chopper and then added the rest and pulsed until it was blended. It only chilled for around 40 minutes but yummy! We had something similar to this growing up. I call them Spammiches: You mash or grind up a can of Spam (we used Prem up in Canada) add relish and mayo or Miracle Whip and mix well. You pile/spread the mix on hamburger buns top with a slice of cheese and broil in the oven until the cheese is melted. SOOOOO excellent I love them to this day. Thanks for the reminder Diane! And your recipe is excellent too!:)",

Out of sheer curiosity we opted to give it a shot. Well my husband loved this spread and has asked me to make it regularly! just a few tips: I used a slab of beef baloney from the deli (buy it by the pound only ask them not to slice it). And rather than using my food processor I used a potato-masher and it came out just right! I also reduced the mayo by about half and added a pinch of both onion and garlic powders plus a dash of pepper blend to the mix. Served on soft warm toasted rolls this stuff was really good.",
