First of all I soaked my ham in cold water for an hour after dicing to leach out some of the salt. I used garlic powder instead of salt. I also used low sodium canned corn and only used 2 eggs. I used cream of mushroom soup as I could not find cream of asparagus but I did add a can of chopped asparagus to it well drained. Instead of the bread crumbs I used left over corn bread that I had crumbled and mixed with 3 strips of crispy bacon chopped well this turned out wonderfully. The salt content was not a problem and it was very flavorful. anytime you are dealing with a salt cured meat such as ham there are ways to reduce the salt content you just have to do the extra step and soak it! I will definitely make this again my family loved it!",

I couldn't eat but more than two bites. I fed my 1 yr old a serving and put some ranch on it to help with some flavor and it tasted worse. I'm surprised she ate it (maybe it was just the ranch).
