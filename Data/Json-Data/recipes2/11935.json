I normally watch the cooking segment (and critique it) and on this morning I was curious who Kevin Curry was from Fit Men Cook so I grabbed my cup of coffee and sat to watch his segment. I am Italian and love the gym. Currently I am doing a weight loss challenge at my gym called HEWFIT and this recipe inspired me to create this dish! I don't miss the cheese at all. Enjoy my paleo version.",
