I made mine with saffron that had already been cut with sugar using a mortar and pestle because that is what I had on hand (and how we use saffron for our cooking at our home). I thought this drink tasted good (probably more of an acquired taste that comes from drinking it regularly); however what impressed me was how I felt after drinking it (\"very satisfied and full of energy\"). This drink could very well be the perfect summer breakfast drink. Thank you LilSnoo for sharing your recipe.",
