If it wasn't for the chocolate, I would make these a breakfast treat. I wish the recipe submitter mentioned in the notes how well and long they keep - wrapped, covered, refrigerated?

These were so sweet. I probably don't need the butterscotch though it went great. Without the candy this would be so healthy. VERDICT: Would bake again.",
