It does have more sodium using the onion soup mix than I would normally use on roasted vegetables so it wouldn't be something I use every time but it was a nice change from my normal recipe. I did need to cook mine about 40 minutes to cook the carrots and to get a little color on the vegetables. I also didn't need quite as much oil as suggested in the recipe.",
