I'm not sure the effort to roast peel and chop one jalapeno is worth the effort...but just my opinion. If I make this again I think I'll just seed chop and add the jalapeno raw as I didn't taste any \"hot.\" The fresh pineapple definitely can be tasted and adds great flavor. This also would make this a snap to get into the oven. Very crumbly and sweet cornbread but very tasty. Served with some homemade jalapeno jelly I had in the fridge.",
