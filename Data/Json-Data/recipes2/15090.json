The cottage cheese is what makes it different and satisfying. I used 1% fat cottage cheese using 1/3 cup instead of 1/4 cup. I served this with a side of freshly chopped tomatoes. Delish!",

I did not find the olive oil to be necessary and used just a tad. I used fresh mushrooms and added red onion and green peppers. Loved the simple addition of basil and I imagine this would have been even better if using fresh basil. I was worried about it not having enough seasoning and made the mistake of adding salt to the veggies. I forgot how salty cottage cheese is on its own. I contemplated adding garlic because I love it but didn't. Overall I thought the veggies jalapeno basil and black pepper gave this enough taste. I also used egg beaters which worked just fine.
