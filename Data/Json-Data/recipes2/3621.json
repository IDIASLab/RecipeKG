In the end I did try to salvage it by doctoring it up a bit but that just didn't do the trick for me. Sorry...",

I also used 1/4 cp red wine not vinegar. While using the Progresso Recipe Starter sauce made this a quick meal it was not what I would use regularly. I think it's best used for an emergency meal or for a family with children. We topped the chicken and penne with peccorino romano cheese and red chile flakes which made it more palable. Thanks Progresso for the opportunity to try your new peoduct.",
