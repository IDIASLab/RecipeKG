I only used 1 tablespoon of the balsamic because I didn't want it to be too sweet -- I like the saltiness! I am interested to try it with the required amount of balsamic though -- perhaps next time. For serving I toasted some baguette slices spread a layer of homemade Garlic Spread (recipe on this site by CKBK) and then topped with the olive mixture. It was an AMAZING appetizer!!! Will make again. Very pretty too.",

It makes a good amount so cut the recipe in 1/2 for a smaller gathering. Thanks!",
