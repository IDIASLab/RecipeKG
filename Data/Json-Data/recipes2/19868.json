I could not find dried apples w/o sulfur (I live in a small town) but the ones I used worked great. I used half organic cider and half organic sparkling apple juice because it was what I had on hand. I used exactly the amount of spices that it called for. It was wonderful! It made 4 jars of apple butter. Before I blended it I thought it would be too runny because there was a lot of juice but once blended the consistancy was perfect! Very easy and delicious!! Thanks for the recipe!",
