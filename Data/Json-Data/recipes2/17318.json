It says this isn't hot without adding more peppers but my experience with poblanos is that sometimes they are very mild and sometimes I've had them and I can't eat them because they are so hot! So be careful! Also removing the seeds and membranes reduces the heat. But as I said these peppers are unpredictable!",

My husband had it with salsa and thought that was good. I would try again and spice up the sauce a little more. Maybe add some mushrooms or other veggies to the potato stuffing. It's an ok healthy recipe that could be great with some tweaking. UPDATE - eating the leftovers today and they are SOOO spicy -- borderline uncomfortably spicy. I have never found poblanos to be hot so I'm quite surprised. just a warning that you may want to consider removing the seeds if you aren't a fan of heat.",
