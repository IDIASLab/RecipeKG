I do have to say that I've never had Sukiyaki Beef so I am not comparing it to how it is from a restaurant - just how it came out and what we thought of it. I was looking for a recipe to use up certain items before they spoiled and this recipe worked out perfectly for that. We followed the recipe exactly except I only had frozen spinach to add. Oh ya and I added garlic. We will definitely make this again!",
