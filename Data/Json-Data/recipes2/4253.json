And while I wouldn't make these everyday they're a nice treat once in a while - especially on the weekend. I used country sausage vs. hot sausage and sauteed the onions vs. having it raw. I did opt out of the pickles and jalepeno slices. And I used slices of cheddar vs. pepperjack as that's what I had on hand. This makes a lot so I definitely have some leftover sandwiches to send with my husband for work. This is a very versatile recipe in that you can customize it to suite your tastes. Overall perfect with a nice glass of OJ!",

Florabunda if you are so concerned about fat & cholesterol surely you know by now how to tweak a recipie to make it a healthier choice. Use ground turkey sausage. Smart Balance Spread instead of butter. Egg whites only...skip the yolk. Reduced fat cheese or no cheese at all. Whole grain/whole wheat buns or bread. It's really not so complicated. When you see a recipie that sounds good think of how to make it healthier and test it out! I made mine with the healthy mods and it turned out excellent and was very low fat and high in protien & fiber...most importantly it was totally yummy! I skipped the pickles though! Will be making these when camping this summer! Thanks for the idea!:-)",
