When I make this blend I toast the buns and spread mayo on the bottom half of each bun followed by some fresh ground pepper. Two minutes before grilling the burgers sprinkle 1/4 tsp. salt on each one then place salt side down on the grill. Salt again 2 minutes before turning. When the hot burger is placed on the bottom half of the bun the mayo and pepper combine to make a complementing sauce. That's it. Place bun tops on and enjoy a great beef burger. If you must put something else on a little fresh lettuce tomato and onion on top of the patty wont kill it. Also I have found that a 5 oz. patty is a perfect amount of beef for this blend. It's a burger for the gods.",
