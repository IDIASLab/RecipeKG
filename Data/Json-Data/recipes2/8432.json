I am so happy that she gifted me a bottle of it because now I can make this sandwich for my lunch whenever I want! It is SO tasty! Sweet and savory all in one. I really enjoyed it. So worth the trip to the store to get a loaf of sourdough too. Oh and I served it with a small cup of the sauce on the side as well for extra dipping. Yum!",

This has got to be the best grilled cheese I think I have ever had before. Perfect blend of smoky spice and was a nice treat for lunch today. Thanks Brian for creating this golden little gem.
