I made a roux then added a bottle of Alfredo Sauce milk to thin crushed garlic pesto cooking white wine mustard fresh chopped mushrooms red pepper and green onion. Salt and pepper. Simmered sauce for 15 mins or so. As others suggested I soaked up the grease from eggplant & chicken. I used a lot of papertowel!! When I served this hot from the oven the egg plant seemed to disintegrate. Perhaps from the weight of entire chicken breasts and eggplant cut too thin? Next time I won't deep-fry. Perhaps simmer strips of chicken breast in sauce to pre-cook layer eggplant as is.",
