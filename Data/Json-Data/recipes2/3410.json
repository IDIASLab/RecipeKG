Nor could I understand why they needed to be peeled, so I didn't peel them.   I made one half as written and the other half with some garlic added when saut\u00e9ing the zucchine.  I like that there is no salt, parmesan has it already as does the tomato sauce.  The original version is a nice idea.  The garlic in my second attempt added some extra flavour and I preferred it so will continue to do it this way in the future.  Thanks for sharing.",

I sliced it lengthwise into 1/4\" thick slabs. Next I cut strips 1/4\" thick from the slabs and tossed out the seed section. Salt the strips for about half hour in a colander then rinse and dry. Fry up 4 cloves garlic and 2 shallots for 2 minutes in the oil and add squash. Sprinkle on your Italian seasoning and cook for 6-8 minutes tossing occasionally. Stir in a couple cups of your favorite sauce for 2 minutes, turn off heat and cover in cheese...enjoy!",

I tried something that seemed similar at the Bone Fish Grill recently, with cubed zucchini, which I did do here too. My only other real change was cutting the basil and oregano in half and that was plenty. I also ended up stirring in a couple of pinches of garlic salt. My issue was the canned tomato sauce, just really had such a strong canned/salty flavor that was very dominant. It almost reminded me of the jarred sauces loaded with vegetables. I may try this with crushed tomatoes, instead, and then re-review. I think, that will do the trick for me. ty",
