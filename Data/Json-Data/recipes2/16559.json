Due to health reasons hubby can't eat white or whole wheat flour so I substituted 1/3 brown rice flour 1/3 oat flour and 1/3 quinoa flour and used raw honey. They are one of the best cookie recipes I've tried on thsi web site. I even threw in flax seed and used almond milk. The grandson loves them also. Thx for the great recipe.",

These cookies can be cut very thin or somewhat thick...just watch them closely in the oven to see that they don't burn or \"over brown\". Use just a small amount of icing for these cookies only need a tiny amount just enough to get your decorations to stick. Enjoy!",

Brown rice flour and oat flour and oat bran plus baking soda plus flaxseed chopped in the coffee grinder saves us from our wheat allergies and we added a touch of rice milk too. Lemon extract rather than vanilla and blueberries apricots and cranberries we added for fruity taste. Gosh I have to go eat another lo! (We love the brown rice syrup substitute for the sugar which with the butter is super awesomely tasty wooo! We love this basic recipe given as it gives us a base to be creative and extraordinary!

They were very easy to roll and cut and actually healthier due to all that oat flour which is a plus if you are trying to sneak in some oats into your loved one's diet. This is the kind of cookie made for decorating icing and dipping in chocolate a delicate flavor that doesn't clash with your choice of decorating; I plan to make these ones for Christmas and pass around along with the recipe.",
