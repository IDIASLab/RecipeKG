I subbed more mozzarella for the  provolone. I used red fish and sea trout as that is what we had in the freezer from a prior fishing trip. Excellent! Smells divine while cooking - wait til the top of the cheese starts to brown before you take it out of the oven. Will make again!!",

I did have to make a change - the only cheese I had on hand was parmesan and cheddar but the cheddar substituted very well for the provolone and mozzarella - and the cod I had didn't have any skin. One other slight alteration: I sprinkled a tiny bit of smoked paprika on the fish before adding the rest of the ingredients. Oh The end result was one tasty meal VERY easy to make. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!",
