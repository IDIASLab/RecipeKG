I was worried about the dreaded \"box cake mix\" flavor coming through so I added a heaping Tbsp. of vanilla extract to the melted butter, egg, and yellow cake mix. To make things easy and to avoid anything sticking I used Reynolds Wrap heavy duty non-stick foil (great stuff). I did up the amount of lemon juice and zest just a bit because I wanted the lemon flavor to come through and it complimented the blueberries nicely. It baked up beautifully and once it was completely cooled I added a little lemon zest on top for a little contrast in color (plus it just looked pretty). Be sure to wipe your knife clean after each cut to avoid a mess. These were light, lemony and bursting with blueberries - you'd never know cake mix made this little dessert so yummy!",

I have requests to make it all the time it is my son-in-laws all time favorite dessert as well as 2 of my friends. It is refreshing with a sweet pop from the blueberry and a tart hint from the lemon. The taste and texture are both heavenly - even to my grandgirl who had texture issues with food. It is easy to make makes a lot and is a lovely presentation. It does need to be cold for it to taste it's best. I'm making it now as it was requested I take it tomorrow to a 4th of July party.",
