My market did not have shallots so I subbed small boiler onions. I also see no need to mix the stock vinegar and brown sugar separately since the entire mixture is going to braise for two hours which would blend the flavors well. This recipe reminds me of a french stew recipe I have made for years that is highlighted by tarragon. Next time I will throw some in for additional flavor. I served this over creamy polenta with a crisp salad and braised carrots. Pour a good glass of Zinfandel or Cabernet and you have a delicious budget friendly meal fit for a king and QUEEN!",

The meat came out perfectly tender and the sauce was rich and flavorful with the use of the balsamic and beef stock. There was a slight sweetness from the brown sugar and balsamic but we really liked it. The sauce was a little thin for how I wanted to serve it so I added a cornstarch slurry at the end to slightly thicken it and it was perfect. My husband was not a fan of the lemon zest on the top but I liked it. I served it over garlic mashed potatoes and it was a perfect meal!",

I am not a fan of stove-top sauteed stewing beef which was what I had. I cut the beef into 1-1 1/2\" pieces. I lined a large sided sheet pan with heavy duty foil and broiled the beef until lightly browned. I sprayed the foil and beef with olive oil before broiling and when done broiling seasoned lightly with black pepper and garlic salt instead of the 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp of pepper before cooking. For the shallots I just did 1/2 cup minced. I didn't want to get out my scale to weigh out 8oz. I cooked them for about 6-7 minutes. I have never added both balsalmic vinegar and brown sugar to a dish. Unsure how that would taste I did 1 Tblsp of balsalmic vinegar and 1/2 Tblsp of sugar. For the stock I used 100% natural Swanson Beef Broth in a can. It was what my local store had. I probably also added a little more mushrooms and used them sliced as they came instead of quartering. After I added the meat back I turned the heat to about 3 and simmered 15-20 more minutes and then served. I may try it a little longer next time to see the difference. I just did not want this to turn into completely shredded meat or too mushy in texture for today. ty",
