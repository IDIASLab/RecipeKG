Few things that I found curious about this recipe. The corned beef hash and the ham are already cooked and then the croquettes are deep fried as well so not sure why they needed to be browned in a skillet on the stove top? Also don t know why half of the ham was browned with the croquette mixture and the other half just mixed into the mixture prior to forming into croquettes. I wish I d read the first review before I made this because I think she s right. Since a lot of liquid cooked out of the veggies drain it before adding the other ingredients. The mixture was too wet to roll (I tried) so I ended up putting the bowl in the fridge for 30 miinutes then another 30 minutes and it still was falling apart. I ended up adding some panko crumbs to firm it up enough so that I could do the flour-egg-panko crumb breading which I don t think negatively affected the flavor. On the positive side they were really tasty moist on the inside but crunchy on the exterior browned up beautifully and we thoroughly enjoyed them. FYI I used a muffin/mashed potato-size scoop and ended up with 10 croquettes. I ve made corned beef hash for years from scratch and had my doubts about canned but this was a pleasant surprise. I served with a side of Spicy Honey Mustard Sauce (from this site) instant pot macaroni & cheese and cole slaw.",
