The blue cheese, horseradish, bread crumbs, and butter made an excellent combination of flavors with the bacon and steak.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  There is no need to spend outrageous sums of money going out for a steak dinner when you can make this dish for less and it will likely taste much better than the restaurant. Thanks for sharing Ski Mom.",
