We have found the best flavor jello to use is orange and to add a couple cans of manadarin oranges. We also just throw it all into a bowl don't do anything to the cottage cheese. The kids usually prefer the regular kind--cottage cheese regular cool whip and regular jello(1-2 boxes depending on how bold you like it). The orange recipe also works with this low cal version of course. Another good flavor is strawberry jello and fresh(or drained frozen)strawberries.",
