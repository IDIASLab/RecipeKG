The recipe was better than store bought salads and was on par with decent restaurant food. There was WAAAAYYYY too much mayo used in the recipe. Next time I would cut the mayo down to about 1 cup maybe even 3/4 of a cup. There also wasn't enough pasta to balance out the abundant amount of mayo. If you are going to keep the mayonaisse the same I would add another 1/2 to 3/4 cup of dried pasta. If you bring the mayo down I would still add about another 1/4 cup of pasta. The taste was good for an imitation crab salad. The Worcestershire and hot sauce give it a nice tang. If you want more spice I would hold up on the hot sauce and add more dijon or Worcestershire instead they will give it a kick with a stronger flavor. If you just want that burning on your tounge sensation go with the hot sauce or add a couple teaspoons of minced raw onion. With a few changes I believe this recipe could be a solid 4 (perhaps higher).",
