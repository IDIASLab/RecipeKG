They are not fluffy and still a good bit doughy inside. And I cooked them an additional 6 minutes. Couldn't bake them any longer or the bottoms would have been completely burnt up. Maybe if the lard had not been melted they would have been fluffier and not so hard and HEAVY! Well at least I can give them to the dog as a treat for going potty outside......",

I scaled back to make 10 using the serving calculator. Somehow, the ingredients were still off and there was no way that this would roll out. I had to add an additional 1/2-3/4 C of flour to even bind it. It was still a loose dough and opted to make drop biscuits rather than rolled & cut. They came out doughy and not flaky or even tender. Baked an additional 5 minutes in a 400 oven.  I agree with the last reviewer.....almost 4 years ago, that it was a waste of ingredients. Sorry, but I'll stick to my tnt recipe.",
