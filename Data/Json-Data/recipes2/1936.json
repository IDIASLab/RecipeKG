One thing is that I assume the recipe is calling for condensed tomato and vegetable beef soups, since it says the 10.75 oz cans. All I could really taste was the condensed soup at first. So, I added one 10.75 oz can full of water, and it was much better. The Ro-tel definitely made this recipe. It gave it a nice flavor. (However, it made it too spicy for my 5 year old to eat it. Oh well.) I had left over homemade chili, so I used the equivalent amount of that instead of a can. Overall, it tasted okay as long as you add some water, and I liked it best with corn chips on top.",
