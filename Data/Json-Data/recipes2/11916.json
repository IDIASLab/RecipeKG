They told it was just too darn plain for their taste. I tried adding oatmeal or rice instead of dry bread crumbs, adding different kinds of veggies, I used canned tomatoes, or ketchup, or tomato paste, or different styles of tomato sauce, even different spices until I came up with this one. When I saw all plates clean and being asked for more, I knew I had found the one they liked and the keeper for our family.",
