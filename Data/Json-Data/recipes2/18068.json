This will infuse them with even more cinnamon flavor. We also use about a bag and a half of Red Hots and don't use red food coloring since the candies make the pears red enough on their own. What can I say we like our pears cinnamon-y! My last recommendation is to serve the pears with a dollop of cream cheese resting on the pear. The cream cheese really ties the room together plus it's a nice counter to the cinnamon.",
