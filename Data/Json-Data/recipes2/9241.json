                "reviewBody": "11.9.17 Didn t have sumac powder and wasn t really looking to buy a bottle (somewhere??) for just 1/4 tsp and maybe end up with yet another spice bottle in the cabinet that I may never use again. So I googled sumac substitute and a number of reliable sources said lemon pepper is a good sub so that s what I used. I also used chicken stock (had an open box in the fridge) instead of vegetable stock. Would recommend not cutting your bread cubes too large because they really do swell up after absorbing the broth. The one thing that this recipe doesn t tell you to do is bake your acorn squash cut side down (as I typically do just forgot this time). After 30 minutes with mine upright the squash was neither cooked nor tender. So I then flipped the squash halves and baked for another 15 minutes for a total of 45 minutes at 350\u00baF. This was a good-sized squash and I had enough stuffing left to fill another medium-size squash. I thought the blend of spices (think Mediterranean inspired) married pretty well with the pork sausage but my husband thought the cinnamon and cloves overpowered the squash flavor. Served as a main course with a cup of soup and small salad with lemon balsamic dressing. Pretty good but not sure I ll make again.",
