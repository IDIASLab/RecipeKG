The best way to describe the texture is sort of like a frozen \"slurpee.\" It also will melt very quickly (so eat fast) but you can certainly enjoy this guilt-free so go ahead and have a second serving. Yeah it may be a compromise to a rich ice cream but I liked it!",

I couldn't scoop any out once frozen, so it had to sit on the counter for about 15 minutes before I could shave bits off with a fork. This strange texture left me pining for something creamier, but at least it's a fairly guilt-free treat. I also made it for my 3 year old as a healthier alternative to ice cream, but unfortunately he didn't go for it. Maybe more suited for a popsicle mold.",

It's more of a sorbet than an ice cream, and it's vegan, no dairy at all, and healthy, no added sugar other than the fruit sugars.  I added a few fresh raspberries to the frozen strawberries and frozen bananas (which I keep in the freezer for smoothies). A small dish was very refreshing and satisfying, and it's a no guilt treat! I will try making it again with peaches or mango, or a combination of berries and fruits. My husband is not much of a sweet eater, and he just raved about it. I like sweets but steer away from them. This really fit the bill for me, offering something light and refreshing without the unhealthier aspects of ice cream!",
