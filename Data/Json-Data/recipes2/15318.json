The asparagus was still crisp and not soggy. The provolone added that nice touch of flavor to the chicken. Took me less time then the recipe called for. Only complaint was that I like my cheese only partially melted and this recipe has the provolone completely melting to the point it almost disappears. Next time I'll add the provolone just removing from the heat or right before serving. Wonderful recipe nonetheless.",

My boyfriend still loves the asparagus better but the rest of family likes the tomato version best. No sauce but it doesn't need it. Very moist.",

I needed only one egg to dredge the breasts in. And like the other reviewers I used much less broth probably only 1/2 cup. I also used fresh asparagus. No need to saute or steam beforehand it steamed perfectly in the 15 min. stated in the recipe. Also I waited till the very end and then laid the cheese on top. It melted quickly in a minute or two. I can't wait to make this again! It is so good and super fast!",

I pounded the chicken breasts and I placed the cheese on top at the very end of cooking. Both ideas came from previous comments. After eating it although delicious as it was next time I make this I will use less broth and put a layer of cheese on the breasts before putting the asparagus on top. Then I will add another layer of cheese on top of the asparagus at the end of the cooking time to just barely melt. The only comment from my family was that they would have liked cheese melted on the chicken. The way I did it all the cheese ended up over the asparagus with none on the chicken.",
