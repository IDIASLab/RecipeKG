I made quite a bit of bacon and used the infamous \"Bills fried bacon\" on this site which I've made before but this time I only used onion and garlic powders and some black pepper. If you haven't tried his ingenious way of cooking bacon yet I suggest you give it a try. Before I added the spinach I sauteed several cloves of slivered garlic in the oil which gave the dish a wonderful flavor. I did need to add some of the pasta water to get those juices flowin'. This was simple relatively quick and delicious enough for an encore. Thanks so much!!",

I used a bit more spinach and pancetta and added a little more oil and a little pasta water so it wasnt so dry. Came out excellent! I love how the crushed peppers give it just a little bit of heat but nothing overbearing. The flavors mesh together perfectly never would have thought. This is definitely a keeper:)",

Fresh can usually be found in the refrigerator section of your store. Remember that fresh pasta requires very little cooking time about three minutes or so. Shaved or grated hard boiled eggs are good but you can also take raw eggs scramble them up and pour into the hot pasta to cook. Or you can just scramble them in a skillet and cook if you are afraid they won't get cooked enough. I would say if you use raw and put into the pasta that you know your egg source and how fresh they are.",
