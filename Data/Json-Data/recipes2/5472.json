I did everything as it said to do and these \"fancy\" cups came out delish. I had to make my own gyoza sauce which I found a perfect recipe on allricipes for. I could not find any in the store. I have to say though I brought them to a BBQ and no one was thrilled to try tuna but when they did they loved it too! I would make these again but maybe for a dinner party instead.",

In the middle of the night I realized what I'd done so this morning I went back and did it right! Even with it all mixed together (which we ate last night) it was really tasty. I made my own dipping sauce which was more like what the remainder of the drizzle ingredients were like and I'm thinking that a store-bought gyoza dipping sauce would have been much better. Next time I'll do that! This is a great little appetizer and can easily be halved for a smaller crowd. Thanks Kim!",
