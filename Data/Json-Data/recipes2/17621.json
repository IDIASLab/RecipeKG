Rather than boil the potatoes a much faster alternative is to just prick each potato and microwave them. Potatoes are less \"soggy\" and retain their moisture. Wait until they are cooler dice them et voila...done. Far less work not to mention heating up the kitchen. Also you can substitute green onions and Dijon mustard...equally excellent results!!",

I was assigned potato salad for a picnic and I hate potato salad and refuse to eat anything with mayo in it, so I did some research and found this recipe, with all things I love in it. It was a huge hit, especially with all the other people who are not fans of your average potato salad.  I made three minor adjustments, I used kalamata olives, since those are my favorite, I used white balsamic, since I thought it would make a prettier presentation, and I discovered at the last second I was out of mustard powder, so I used a heaping tablespoon of dijon mustard.  It was great, will make again.  Plus it is picnic friendly!!",

I roasted the red peppers myself and used 2 shallots instead of the white onion because I find this onion too sharp tasting to use uncooked. I sure red onions would be even better. I used the microwaving technique suggested by some other people to cook the potatoes and it really kept the potatoes from getting mushy. However make sure to test each of the potatoes for doneness because a few of the bigger potatoes weren't quite cooked long enough for my taste. This recipe was fantastic none the less! Thanks Peregrintook!",
