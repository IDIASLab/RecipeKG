Their meal plan frequently includes dishes made with good-for-the-planet ingredients. Oats are an essential rotation crop, delivering nutrients into the soil. So, they created a twist on the classic Italian preparation, swapping out rice for oats. This is best served with a hearty protein (beef, pork, lamb, goat, or chicken) and sauteed seasonal vegetables.",

Luckily I keep liquid stock concentrate in the fridge so I was able to quickly heat up more, but I ended up using about 5 cups of stock to 2 cups of oats instead of the 3 cups the recipe called for. The only other change I made was I added about 1 cup of chopped mushrooms half way through the initial softening of the spring onion. Very flavorful, and while labor intensive with the standing and stirring it was not at all hard to make. Will be making again.",
