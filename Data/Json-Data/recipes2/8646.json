Used ground turkey used slightly less quinoa a little over a cup & added an extra 7 minutes cooking time. Super moist & delicious. A fantastic way to incorporate veggies for anti-veggie folks. Will make this many times in the future. Can't give this one enough stars!",

I wasn't sure how it would turn out since the raw mixture was so wet and kind of a sloppy mud-like consistency, but it turned out perfect, moist, delicious and amazing!
