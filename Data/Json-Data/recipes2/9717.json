Next time I will line the pan with wax paper. I will also double the amount of salted dry roasted peanuts to have good coverage of the yummy center. Any peanuts that don't stick to the mixture could easily be kept for a future use. This makes alot so it was great for my holiday trays! Thanks so much for sharing!",

What I would do next time is line the pan with wax paper coated with a non stick spray. Mine stuck a bit to the wax paper. To speed up the marshmallows melting put the bowl into the the micro for 10-20 seconds then continue stirring. Also I used a bit smaller size pan one jar of peanuts was plenty to cover the top and bottom. I sprinkled kosher salt onto top before adding the top layer of peanuts. Mine had to chill for about 3 hours before cutting nicely. Super delicious! Thanks for sharing.",

Not too chewy not too soft - I only used half of the sweetened condensed milk in mine. To make sure they wouldn't stick to the pan I sprayed my glass dish down with butter flavored cooking spray. Worked like a charm. Once I spread the peanuts in the bottom however I noticed that I used more than half of the jar. Instead of running out to buy more nuts I rummaged through my pantry and found cashew halves & pieces and used them as a mix with the peanuts - SO AWESOME. Like another reviewer I also sprinkled a little sea salt on the top of the goo mix before adding the last half of the nuts. Took me maybe 10 minutes to make one pan. Great recipe!",
