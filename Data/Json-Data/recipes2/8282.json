Add a cup of flour too before you pour the mixture in the pie crust. I baked (high altitude) the pie for 15 minutes at 450 uncovered the whole time and then lowered the temp to 350 and baked for another 50 minutes. PERFECT. It s SO creamy and set super well. Not runny at all. The original one I made with this recipe calling for 2 cups of almond milk.. absolutely a disaster I ended up throwing it away it was so gross.",

                "reviewBody": "This is what I call a \"good start recipe\". First time making a dairy-free pumpkin pie so we didn't know what to expect. My daughter mixed in ingredients as I called them out. I didn't initially add the egg yolk. The spices I modified per my tastes i.e. not a ginger fan so very soft on ginger and cloves can easily overwhelm a delicate recipe like this so I reduced that as well. Love nutmeg so pumped it up a lot while balancing it against the cinnamon. I measure spices and stuff with my hands so I can't say how much. The end result was like soup and I knew it would not bake into a proper pie. My adjustments: add 15 oz more pumpkin puree add 1 full extra egg add additional spice in similar ratios at about 1/2 the measurements. (Again these are vague because I use my hands and heart) I didn't use a cup of sugar I used 3 fist fulls. The soup became the proper consistency for pie. As it was just the 2 of us we tested phyllo dough in mini muffin tins. 3 layers lightly brushes with egg wash between and they were amazing! We also made 6 pie crust tarts in a regular cupcake tin. We still had enough filling for a 9 inch pie pictured above. The adjustments we made created an amazing addition to our meal.",

Some say powdered erythritol is better than granulated erythritol because it doesn't dissolve as easily and you can still taste grainy bits. but I don't know if you want to use powdered sugar in Vez that's the question here. Also I have heard 15 minutes at 425 and then 40 minutes at 350. What if I prebake the pie? if I do that what would the temperature and time be for bank at that point if that crust is a homemade almond flour crust that's been prebaked. your recipe is the closest I have found to what I'm looking for but it does use regular pieshell and granulated regular sugar which neither I can use I have to make my own pieshell and alternative to sugar and that's why I'm asking if anybody can answer this for me please do.

Probably should bake at a higher temp initially (425?) to set the crust then reduce to the recommended temp which would also probably reduce the baking time. Also a bit sweet for me. Could probably reduce the sugar a bit. Overall though a great option for the lactose intolerant among us!",
