We serve ours Brazilian-style over savory rice (cooked with chicken stock, onions, and garlic) with crushed potato chips on top, but the sauce is also good with noodles, tortilla chips, potatoes, or any carbohydrate.",

I will def make again but I may try putting diced celery in it for texture and maybe swap crumbly bleu for the parmasean cheese. Also, I would cut the chicken up into chunks like the beef is in beef stroganaff .",
