There's no way you achieved what's in the photo with that much liquid. Next time I'll use a 10 oz can of beef broth and an 8 oz can of tomato paste. You can always add a bit of water if it begins to look dry near the end of the cooking time. I also agree with others that you need to add the artichokes and olives an hour before it's done. If you use less liquid adjust the spices accordingly to about half what is called for. I'll make this again my way.",

I decided to use half the beef broth as almost all of the reviews I read said there was way too much broth. A few reviews also said that the olives and artichokes had little or no flavor. So I decided to test it myself. I split the olives and artichokes in half and put 1 half in the beginning on top of the meat as the recipes directs to and the remanding half about 15 minutes before it was done. The olives and artichokes that I put it n onto the meat or n the beginning did have no taste but the ones I put in at the end did. This dish is amazing and thank you for it!!",

Made very few adjustments to this that were ideas I picked up from the other recipe. Coated the roast in kosher salt pepper then flour before browning in olive oil. Then cut up into pretty large chunks and put in crock pot. Topped with onion and garlic as directed but added extra artichokes and kalamata olives. Sauce tomatoes and spices all same except skipped the beef broth and added just a can (about 1-1/2 cups) of Cabernet. Meant to cook on low for five hours but accidentally left it on high! Still turned out fine. Just fished out the meat to the surface and shredded with two forks. This is NOT too much liquid once meat is shredded and all mixed up with extra helpings of artichokes and olives. Served over pipe rigate pasta (short curved tubes are good for holding the sauce). Amazing flavor with wine and olives. Making this again and again!",
