There didn't seem to be enough liquid for the amount of chia seeds and when I used the written amount it came out very thick like a jello consistency. The type of milk isn't specified so I used an unsweetened vanilla cashew milk to make it vegan and figuring that the vanilla would work well with this flavor profile. Maybe using a fatty cow's milk blunts the flavors of the spices but to me they were extremely overpowering and bitter. These are all strong spices to begin with and there's so much clove in this as to give that numbing feeling to the mouth that clove will do. I tried to doctor it up by adding another 1/2-3/4 cup of milk and some maple syrup. That helped but still it's not something I would make again and may still end up tossing out. I could add more syrup or sugar to try saving it but that defeats my goal to limit my sugar intake.",

This was so super thick it could barely be stirred after 30 minutes. I looked up some other chia pudding recipes and they called for a higher ratio of milk to seeds. I ended up adding a whole cup more of milk and it was still pretty thick. The servings definitely have to be off on this-- 1/2 c of chia seeds is way too much for 1 person. I got 4 servings with the added milk. I added blueberries to a serving and it made an OK afternoon snack. I definitely couldn't eat a lot of this. I will probably add the rest of the mixture to some oatmeal and eat it that way. I did end up adding this to oatmeal for 3 days in a row (which was good) and I still had to throw some of this away.",
