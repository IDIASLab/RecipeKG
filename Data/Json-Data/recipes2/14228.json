None of the ingredients are \"homemade\" and if you are making a pie that has all processed ingredients, it will not taste natural.  I prefer the taste of homemade foods, but like this treat and knew, even before making it, that it wouldn't taste like I whipped everything together on my own.  If you want it to taste less processed: create your own graham cracker crust with crushed graham crackers and melted butter, use the juice from fresh squeezed lemons rather than frozen lemonade, use all-natural ice cream and whip whipping cream and a small amount of sugar together for the topping.

I use 1 package of lemonade kool-aid, one can of sweetened condensed milk, and one small container of kool whip. Stir the lemonade into the condensed milk until dissolved and fold in half of the kool whip. Pour into the crust of your choice and top with the other half of the kool whip. There is no need to freeze, just refridgerate for an hour or you can have it right away if your condensed milk is cold. This comes out perfect every time and is cheaper and quicker.",

I made it a day ahead and it set up perfect for the next day (and the lemonade flavor really set up nice since it sat overnight) Made it for dessert at a BBQ very light & refreshing. I used a little more lemonade concentrate than the recipe called for to make it extra lemony & tart. It was devoured at the BBQ and lots of compliments. I needed 2 pies so I doubled the recipe- 1/2 gal ice cream 12 oz lemonade concentrate and 16 oz of cool whip and I ended up w/ 2 pies and more left over I could have gotten 3 maybe 4 pies out of this?! Will definately make this over & over again and share w/ others. I'd like to try it w/ limeade also as some other reviewers mentioned. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",

Most of the time I use frozen vanilla yoghurt which gives it a smoother taste and also I feel healthier. Certainly does not detract from the taste. Frozen lime juice is excellent too with a chocolate crust. I also top the lemon version with either raspberry sauce or blueberry sauce. No leftovers that is for sure.",
