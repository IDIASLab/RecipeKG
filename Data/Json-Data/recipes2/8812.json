Fortunately, I didn\u2019t add all of the cooked pasta at one time, added about 3/4 of it, which probably equates to about 5-6 oz (rather than the 8 oz that I cooked).  Adding all of the pasta certainly would be a way to stretch the budget, that\u2019s for sure, but you will lose some of the tuna flavor.  We don't eat bacon bits, so I cooked crisp a couple slices of bacon which worked out well.  This recipe makes a lot, and in this house, this is definitely five main course servings, rather than a side dish. I added a bit of chopped red bell pepper which gave it a pop of color and a little crunch, and after I took the photo, added  some green peas (great addition!).  Hubby is much more of a tuna lover than I, and he REALLY liked it, and I LIKED it.  Thanks for sharing.",
