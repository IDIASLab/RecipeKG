I followed the recipe exactly and sliced the meat thin using a food slicer.  The gravy is to die for!!  The trick is to not hurry the gravy.  I actually started the gravy in a pan on the stove top and then added the juices from the roaster when the meat was done.  This gave the gravy time to thicken and the flavors to merge together.  I served it with mashed potatoes and fresh, sliced, cooked carrots.  Yummy!!  :)",
