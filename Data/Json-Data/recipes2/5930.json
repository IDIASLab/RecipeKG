Obviously when he retired from coal mining he had way to much time on his hands, so Mom gave him an apron. The rest is history.  If on a budget this recipe can be adjusted accordingly. Remember a little of this, a little of that. It will come out tasting great. Get creative. Dad was partial to fettuccini, but this goes great with just about anything.",

I also had an 8 oz. pkg. of sliced fresh mushrooms to use up so I used those in place of the canned. I sauteed all the veggies in a tiny bit of evoo and a heavy spray of PAM cooking spray and that worked great. I seasoned the veggies w/ some s&p while they were cooking. I transferred the mixture to my casserole dish and poured the sauce over then topped w/ some cheese (did not use as much as we are trying to eat healthier). This was so tasty! I served it alongside steak and roasted red potatoes but I do agree this would be awesome over pasta. I was glad to find a new healthy veggie side...a keeper for sure YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
