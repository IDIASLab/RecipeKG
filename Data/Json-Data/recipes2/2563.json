We both appreciate the low sugar and they are more than sweet enough with the applesauce and sweetened coconut. I thought about using unsweetened but am glad I followed the recipe as there is only 1/2 cup brown sugar. I had to cook them 30 mins in my oven...let them cool and they were super delicious..loved the crunchy outside texture and the moist inside...love the oats in this version of morning glory muffins too!
