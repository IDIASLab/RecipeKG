                "reviewBody": "I absolutely loved the flavor of  these but I did have some trouble with this recipe as written. I fry fish often in the summer months when the catfish are biting  so frying fish is not new to me. However, I have never fried my fish in corn flour so I'm not sure if that was the problem (love the flavor that added by the way), if there is just too much breading going on, or if it was the butter/oil combo but I had trouble getting the breading to stick. I made sure that the first side was nice and brown before I ever tried to flip but I still lost most of the breading. The bottom layer that is down in the butter browns but the layer next to the fish stays wet and crumbly.  I will make this again because the flavor was great but when I do, I will only bread them one time and I will use only oil to fry them in. Oil needs to be to that bubbling smoking point when you first drop something in to fry. Doing so not only creates that crusty seal that adheres your breading but it also keeps the fish from getting \"drowned\" in oil. Once it is drowned it is nearly impossible to get that crisp all the way through. I liked the flavor the butter added but it hindered me from getting the oil to that smoke point that was needed and I think that is where the problem came in. If you enjoy the buffalo flavor then you should really give this one a try and maybe you'll have better luck with the breading staying on than I did.",
