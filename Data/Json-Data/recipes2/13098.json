I usually cook it at a higher temp for less time, but thought I'd try this method.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I truly believe this is the best way to cook bacon, however I'm knocking off a star because the cook time is way too long. Unless you like your bacon overdone and crumbling, then I highly recommend you start watching the bacon around 15 minutes. After 12 minutes, my bacon was really starting to get dark, so that's when I flipped the slices. I then cooked it 4 minutes more and it was a little overdone for my tastes, but realize some will like it a bit more crispy. 30 minutes would be way too long for most anyone, though.",
