I finally concluded that to mix it continuously on or off the hot water. Otherwise it separates while it cools. Also the recipe calls for 1 1/3 cup of sugar twice. By comparing this recipe to others I decided that was a misprint. I only added one of the two called for. I did not bake it 50 minutes. It was more like 35 minutes and that was almost too long. I checked doneness with toothpick",
