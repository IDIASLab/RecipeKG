I still had to drain some of the liquid before pouring into my jars. I'd cut back a bit on the cider next time OR use more apples. I used a combination of Gala and Fuji apples and this recipe has a delicious flavor. My family and neighbors thank you!!! The honey is the perfect ingredient so yummy!",

I also used only half the spices and only 1/4 of a cup of honey and it is still very good not overly spiced. I also simply used my hand mixer to blend the apples which worked great.",

The tree is done for the year so I'm eagerly waiting to use some locally-grown apples this Autumn and make more of this delicious apple butter for homemade gifts this Christmas season. Better than storebought and very simple! This is a keeper for sure and for certain.",
