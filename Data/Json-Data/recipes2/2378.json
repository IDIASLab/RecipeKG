I also diced my chicken breast prior to sauteing it, and seasoned it with garlic salt and onion powder. While this doesn't seem that it would do much to help a dish, it certainly did in my opinion.",

You'll notice there are no spices in the recipe as written. Next time I'll add the spices when assembling. I will be making this again. Update: This time I used leftover Christmas turkey breast and added 2 tablespoons (yes tablespoons) of low sodium seasoned salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper to the mix. This makes a good 10 cups which doesn't fit into my 9x9x2 inch square glass baking dish. I had 4 cups left to freeze. I think 8 ounces of dry pasta (by weight) is too much. I will use 4-6 ounces next time. I used Birdeye's California blend vegetables thawed and cut into bite-sized pieces. I do like this recipe but it needs a little tweaking.",
