I'm only giving it 4 stars though because it did like a curdle-y thing that made everyone think that the sauce was some form of beef that roughly resembled canned dog food. Seriously it looked pretty bad. I doubled the recipe though and it was all eaten so I don't know what tweaks if any it could have used. Oh I didn't realize that I didn't have bacon though so I used pepperoni.",
