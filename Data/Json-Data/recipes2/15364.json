I am always asked for the recipe and people beg me to make it for parties. I usually add more beer and garlic and since this thins the consistency I'll throw in a handful of shredded Romano cheese to thicken it back up. Blue cheese is also a great add-in for a twist on the taste. IF you have any leftovers (if I don't use a bread bowl I can sometimes scrape some up) try adding a couple of spoonfuls to mashed potatoes for a new side dish. Absolutely delicious!",

I used a loaf of french bread (buttered and broiled for a few min to make \"crusty\" bread). Also I could tell this was going to make ALOT so I reduced the cream cheese to (1) 8oz pkg used 8oz velveeta instead of cheddar (keeping it creamy) and no garlic powder. If you melt in the microwave and stir every minute until heated through and melted it turns out great and clean-up is minimal (and you can dip RIGHT from the bowl). Also prevents burning or any other possible disasters. I still have a little leftover so I guess I'll have to get more bread!!",
