I used some pure maple I had from my pre-low carb days... fresh garlic some fresh ground multi-variety (green red black) pepper I use on eggs and a good quality season salt I get in Milwaukee... the only change I made was to use the season salt on the meat not in the sauce... I was also afraid of caramelizing so I grilled the meat 5 minutes a side before adding the sauce then finished another 5 on a side... but because of the pure maple nothing turned black... nobody guessed the \"secret\" ingredient (the maple syrup) and everyone loved it...",

However this is one recipe where you can decide last minute that you feel like a steak tonight without being concerned that you haven't had it in the fridge in your favorite marinade for most of the day. The ingredients are common enough that you're bound to always have them on hand. The maple syrup and the simple spices blend nicely for a steak that has more than just that pure beef flavour. So next time you're looking for a quick way to prepare a slab of juicy beef try this recipe.",

However please realize that if you use this moist rub immediately after placing the steak on the grill you cannot cook the steak past medium rare -- or medium but that is pushing it. Remember sugar burns easily. If you like a well done steak DO NOT brush this on the steak until it is medium/medium well. Your results will be superior.",

The sugars in the syrup made a great crust on the outside and the added flavors really enhanced the flavor of the sirloin steaks that I made. A few notes: Fresh ground black pepper is so accessible nowadays and it really does make a difference in recipes like this so do your self a favor and use it here. BUT I have great faith in dried herbs and spices if utilized properly. So I replaced fresh garlic cloves with garlic powder. I find that crushed or minced garlic cloves rarely add enough flavor to make any difference in grilling and are just a hassle to apply effectively in recipes like this. Garlic powder integrates flavor into the sauce very easily and there's no problems with evenness or application. Sure the flavor isn't of \"Fresh\" garlic but the most important flavor is the steak anyway. (Garlic salt works well too just be sure to omit some of the \"seasoned salt\" as well) Also with this sauce there's no such thing as too much. Only so much sauce is going stay on the meat as it is and while it's cooking the sauce tends to roll off the meat anyway so keep the steak well coated. I promise you that it's hard to over-do it.",
