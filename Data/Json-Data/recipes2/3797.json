I used 2 sticks of butter, not the butter spread. Other ingredients I followed the instructions, but I would recommend rehydrating the dried cranberries in boiling water for 5 minutes and then draining. Also, cream your butter, eggs and vanilla in a large bowl, combine dry ingredients in a small bowl. I alternated dry ingredients and mashed bananas into the sugar mixture then added cranberries and zest last. I have not tried the orange glaze, but it sounds yummy! Labor intensive, yes, but this bread smells DELICIOUS baking, and is very moist and tasty. Worth a try! Great Fall bread.",

I did add a splash of OJ to the batter and replaced some of the water in the glaze with OJ which boosted the orange flavor and resulted in a really nice glaze. The muffins were plenty moist firm but not dense and had layer upon layer of interesting flavors. A couple of comments on the instructions for a novice baker. Be sure your sticks of spread are at room temperature for ease of mixing/creaming. I d also recommend adding the cranberries & orange peel to the banana mixture then mix all of your dry ingredients together before adding to the banana mixture to be sure you get good distribution of ingredients in the batter. These muffins made me think of Fall and the upcoming Holidays. Would make again.",
