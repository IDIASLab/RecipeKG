Unfortunelty once they froze they seemed to lose some of their flavour. I think they are good but are lacking something just not sure what. They were definitely refreshing on a hot day not sweet at all though. I would almost think it is the coconut that is lacking to make it a true pina colada flavor perhaps switching coconut for the vanilla? Either way they were a little too bannany but the adults liked them and the kids didn't",

A few drops of rum flavoring might be better than the vanilla for a true pina colada taste. Decreasing the coconut milk to 1/2 a can would allow more of the pineapple flavor to shine through. I'm trying to avoid sugar but some sugar and fresh lemon juice would brighten the flavor.",
