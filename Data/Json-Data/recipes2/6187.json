If you prefer your drink a little less sweet you can reduce the honey or use plain yogurt in place of the vanilla yogurt. If you have trouble finding lemon yogurt in your area use plain yogurt and add 1 or 2 tablespoons of frozen lemonade concentrate. Also I used canned sliced mango and just added the intact pieces to the blender. It isn't really necessary to puree them first; it just makes it easier to measure. A final note: as I submitted it the recipe says serve chilled; I personally think it tastes better cold. Enjoy! (I was just going to add this comment without rating it but it won't allow me to do that so 5 stars LOL!)",

Because I already had plain yogurt in the house for other recipes I whipped up substitutes for the lemon yogurt and vanilla yogurt -- I mixed lemon juice and sugar into two cups of plain yogurt and vanilla extract and sugar into the other cup of yogurt. It worked great! I also used a whole mango and just tossed it into the blender in chunks instead of pureeing it and while that meant my lassi wasn't perfectly smooth the texture was actually really nice.",
