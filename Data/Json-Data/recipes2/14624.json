I used four small ones and would use five depending on the consistency you want. Also the crushed ice thing was odd to me. I tried to beat it until it melted but still had to pick out several pieces. Not sure what would be the way around that. The only other thing I may change is to add a little sugar to the top layer of whipped cream when I beat it. It doesn't call for it and none of the previous reviewers mentioned it so I didn't use any. But if you taste the top layer by itself (I pick things apart to eat them:) it of course doesn't taste very good. All in all a YUMMY pie that I will make again! Thank you Angela! Oh by the way I used No Roll Pie Crust II off this sight and it is so flaky and easy!",

The pies (I was able to make two with this recipe) were very rich and delicious yet not too sweet. I didn't have any crushed ice on hand but it made no difference as far as I could tell. Also the whipped cream topping tasted much better after adding some powdered sugar. It's not necessary to pipe on the topping as I just used a spatula. Everything tasted great together in Nilla pie crusts. After making one with peach on the bottom my advice is to stick with the bananas!",

This is a wonderful desert to make if you don't want to spend much time on it no time at all to mix together. I will use my homemade regular pie crust next time and actually might not whip as long as I did because it was just a smidge too stiff. I would have liked it a touch creamier - still a great pie and much better then other versions I've tried. This would also make a great filling for a summer trifle recipe with various fruits or even switching the banana mix for chocolate for a chocolate cream pie. Options!! Thanks for the recipe.",

You do not need the ice in this recipe. In fact I used heavy whipping cream just brought from the store (so it wasn't even all THAT cold) and it worked just fine. The creamy consistency/texture of cream pies is what makes them great. I decided the chunkiness of so many bananas detracted from the creamy texture and the pie as a whole. I will not use as many bananas next time. What bananas I do use will be sliced razor thin. You don't really even need the whipped topping part - or you could put some on each slice when you serve it. This isn't the excellent banana cream pie you'd expect from a great sweet shop -- but it fits the bill in a pinch and you can make as many different flavored pies as they make instant puddings. Couldn't be easier.",
