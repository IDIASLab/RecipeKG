I made a couple of substitutions to work with what I had on hand--my homemade tomatoes put up from my garden, already seasoned with onion, olive oil and parsley for one. I also used regular tomato juice rather than V-8, and added  garlic powder, salt and pepper. I used basil from my garden, so it couldn't have been any fresher. So you throw a few things into a pot, stir, and add a couple of things to finish. How easy is that? Not only that, but this soup, garnished with a sprig of basil, was as pretty and delicious as any we've had in fine restaurants. This is yet another example of how great food doesn't have to be time consuming and complicated--just a few good and simple ingredients can turn out something amazing. ",

I added about a tsp of sugar, lots of salt and pepper, some garlic powder and a pinch of curry powder.  I actually liked the soup better before adding the cream (I used half and half) and butter.  I'll definitely make it again, but leave out the cream and butter.  Oh, I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar just at the end of cooking.  Thanks for the recipe!",

Even my husband, who normally can give or take tomato soup, said this was great and he liked that it was thicker than the average bowl of Campbell's- and much tastier too!  I followed the recipe completely until the very end, and instead of an entire cup of cream, I only added half a cup, and I omitted the butter altogether.  The creamy consistency was perfect. I also added a little bit of dried dill to add to the herb flavor, a teaspoon of bottled minced garlic, and some salt and pepper.  The end result was VERY close to the Tomato-Dill Soup I love at one of our local restaurants.  Great recipe Rachel!",
