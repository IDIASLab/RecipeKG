Couple of notes about the recipe: I made a half batch and got close to 60 truffles (using my 1\" cookie scoop), so the 36 truffles for a full batch has to be incorrect. It didn't say what kind of chocolate chips to use (milk chocolate, semi-sweet, dark, etc), so I used a 12 oz. package of semi-sweet. It wasn't quite enough to coat all 60 of my truffles, so I quickly melted two cubes (from a 24 oz. package / 12 cubes per package) of chocolate bark. Also want to mention that I used my electric mixer to beat the butter, powdered sugar and condensed milk - but then switched to a wooden spoon when stiring in the coconut and walnuts. It was REALLY thick, and hard to mix (I actually broke the little wooden spoon that I was using), so I added a splash of milk and switched to a heavier wooden spoon to mix the rest. To decorate, I melted a cube of white chocolate in the microwave and put it in a Wilton disposable decorator bag fitted with a #3 tip. Just a litle drizzle over the truffles really makes them pretty.",

I really should have gone with my instinct about the number of truffles that this recipe makes as well. I rolled and rolled the one inch balls and was so frustrated I ended up with 120 before I gave up and put the last quarter of the dough in the freezer for future use. Would I make these again? Yes but perhaps cut the recipe down to one quarter. The only change that I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts. Thanks I'm sure that the family will love them.",

This in itself changed the amount of time this took to over 3 hours! I cut the sugar in half and used only ONE 16oz box of confectioners sugar. The recipe was vague regarding the ingredients but I used SALTED butter and UNSWEETENED coconut and DARK CHOCOLATE chips. I used a mini fondue fork to dip the balls into the chocolate and then used a thick flat toothpick to smooth out the chocolate after dipping the ball but before setting onto the waxed paper.",
