TIP: reserve strain and season the water that you used to poach the chicken breasts to use as some or all of the chicken broth. Next time I will use more flour and use heavy cream instead of milk. This wasn't really \"creamy and cheesy\" as noted in the description. It was rather thin but still very good!",
