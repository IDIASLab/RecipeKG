Even my fianc\u00e9 who normally asks for meat on the side with veggie dishes loved this just by itself. The only change I had was to cook it on the stovetop over medium-low heat instead of baking. I would add the cheese just before serving or even just sprinkle it on top of the soup instead of stiring it in as it got a little rubbery from cooking for 10 mins. Also I'll definately make more next time - the 6 serving recipe was just enough for 3 main dish servings (and that was with 15 ounce cans instead of 8 ounce) and we were wishing we could go back for seconds.",

As my son described it \"A little bland if you know what I mean.\" Maybe it's because I used white cooking wine instead of dry white wine but the flavor seemed to be lacking something. Maybe more garlic more basil or additional spices. Too the cheese turned a little rubbery in places. Maybe it melted too quickly. I will try this again some day with modifications. It looked nice but the flavor punch was not as good as I expected--particularly for as long as it took to prepare. ADDENDUM: My wife and I both agreed that after sitting in the refrigerator for a day this soup tasted better. So I'm adding another 1/2 point.",
