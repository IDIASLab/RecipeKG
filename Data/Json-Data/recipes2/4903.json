Pre-heated the oven to 200, placed sheet pan in oven and after 10 minutes turned the oven off and left the light on.   A couple of hours later they were thoroughly dry & crisp.   Crunch them up on the parchment paper and then use the parchment as a funnel to transfer to the jar.  This will make a nice addition to soups and stews.  Thanks!",
