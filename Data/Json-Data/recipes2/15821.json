I had dried rosemary leaves so I used my mortar and pestal to grind them to a fine powder and it was good that way. Before serving I removed the fish and added 1T cornstarch (mixed with water) to the sauce to thicken it (it was too soupy) and this turned out nicely! I used a crumbled tomato and basil feta and it just made the dish! Don't leave off the feta cheese! I also added 2t minced garlic to the sauce along with the spices and was happy with the result! We will definitely be making this one again! Thanks for the post!",

I served the fish over the couscous for a delicious meal! I also prepared \"Broccoli Corn and Green Bean Saute\" from this site. Thank you for this recipe that I will fix again soon!",
