I m a new cook at age 65 but I m not afraid to try something out of the ordinary such as this. Because I do the cooking 3 nights each week this was ample for my wife and me for two meals. It reheats OK in the microwave. I liked it well enough to take the picture. I ll make it again.",

Loads of toppings; I used orange and red bell peppers and sauteed all the veggies and garlic in olive oil and flashed with balsamic vinegar instead.
