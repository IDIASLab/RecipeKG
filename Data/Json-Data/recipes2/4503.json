If you want buttermilk cornbread use buttermilk and substitute 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda for the baking powder.  Add creamed corn if you want creamy corn cornbread.  \n\nThis is a GREAT base recipe to keep -- no need for 3 cornbread recipes.  Just add want you want to this one.\n\nTips:  You can melt the butter in the skillet, then pour it into the batter.  No need for another pan.  There'll be a little butter left in the pan, so you won't need the oil. Do NOT overmix.  Mix all the dry ingredients together separately then use a large spoon or spatula to fold the wet and dry together.",
