I cut waaaay back on the buillion- about 2-3 tsp per batch.  I also cut down the seasoning salt- I'd rather let the recipient salt to taste.  My biggest tip- once the mix is made, run it through a blender or food processor until it makes a nice even powder.  This makes a MUCH smoother soup- less like mashed potatoes, more like soup.  It cuts the volume exactly in half, so be sure to change the directions from 1/2 cup mix to 1/4 cup.  It fit perfectly in pint jars.  I'll use this method again!",

I tested a cupful and discovered that the soy milk is just fine but the sodium is too high... very salty. Also when using a half cup of the mix as the directions call for when it cools even slightly it is like eating mashed potatoes not soup. Don't know for a fact but am guessing that the soy milk wouldn't cause that problem... so i suggest cutting WAY back on the seasoned salt and starting out with 1/4 cup mix to make it more like soup. Other than the salt it has very nice flavor. To solve the sodium problem I just made a second batch left out the seasoned salt althogether and mixed the two together. Thanks for a nice recipe that I can send to my widowed MIL who lives alone and doesn't like to cook much... this will give her many nice little meals!",
