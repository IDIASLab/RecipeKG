We frequented it often for their Western Omelet sandwich (well maybe not ONLY the sandwich) which was served on rye bread (and it was cheap too!). Saw this recipe today and had to try this long-forgotten sandwich. As written I think it s too heavy in peppers and onions. I basically chopped 2 mini bell peppers 1 small jalapeno and added about 3 Tbsp of onions. I wanted two sandwiches so I used 3 eggs and cut the omelet in half which worked perfectly for sandwiches. Salt pepper and about a tsp of butter in the skillet also are needed IMO. If you're watching cholesterol and fat I think Egg Beaters would work well in reducing those values. Nix thanks for reminding me of this old favorite. Next time I ll be sure to have rye bread on hand.",

For two eggs you would never use a large red large green and a whole onion. Dice and add the amount that works for you. I toasted sourdough bread and add sliced tomatoes and a piece of Romaine lettuce. Great breakfast sandwich.",
