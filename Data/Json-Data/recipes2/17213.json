Mixed it let it sit for an hour and spread it about an inch thick in a glass baking dish and baked until t was bubbly. I sprinkled some cheese on top after pulling it out of the oven. Mighty tasty! The only thing I would change next time is the amount of the onion soup mix. It was over powering and made the dip very salty even right out of the fridge before putting in the oven. Otherwise yuuummmyyyy!",
