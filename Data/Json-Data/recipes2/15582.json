I added a little more soy sauce and a little less vegetable oil.  Also, once the steak went on the grill my husband boiled the remaining marinade in a saucepan, added a tiny bit of cornstarch, and made a fabulous sauce to dip the meat in!!",

I used olive oil vs. veg oil low sodium soy sauce white wine vinegar and chili sauce instead of ketchup along with the garlic. In most marinades that call for ketchup I use chili sauce as a good rule of thumb because it provides that little extra kick. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate for four hours. Be sure to bring your steak to room temp. before grilling. The steak came out very flavorful - a definite keeper.",

I am not very good at grilling or frying so I also cooked the steak in the oven (300F for 1 hour). I put the marinade in with the steak when I cook it to help keep it moist. As long as it is not over cooked it comes out tender and moist and we really enjoyed it. Any time we do have steak this is the recipe that we will use.",
