I will be making this again but next time I will use less sour cream on top of the chicken... I found it a little too much (and I LOVE sour cream!). The potatoes were the best I've ever tasted and I may keep them separate from the rest of the dish next time. Also I will use my food processor for the sun-dried tomato/spinach mixture as it would not come together in the blender even after adding a little olive oil to help emulsify it. But a very tasty chicken dish for sure!",

I used a Vidalia onion instead of red no green peppers 2 cloves garlic frozen spinach salt and freshly ground black pepper and fat-free sour cream (couldn't even tell the difference!!!). I added about a tbsp. of butter to the potato mix as well. Next time I will leave the parmesan out of the spinach mix because it stuck all over the bottom of my non-stick pan when I sauteed it with the chicken. You could make this vegetarian substituing your favorite veggie for the chicken.",

The recipe suggests 15 minutes prep time but it took us more like 30 minutes. Instead of chicken tenderloins we used two large boneless chicken breasts cut into strips. The pesto mix was incredible and it would probably be great on its own tossed with some pasta. Overall tasty but prep time long. Would be best cooked for a weekend meal when you have more time.",
