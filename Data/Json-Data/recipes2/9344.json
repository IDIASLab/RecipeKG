Since the salt level in the dip itself is pretty heavy when making I cut back on the bacon bits by 1/4 of what the recipe calls for and added 1/4 more sour cream than what the recipe calls for and that leveled it out enough. At my parties the reviews were great as the dip is always gone QUICKLY. This is so easy and with the kettle chips its simply... an indulging intake of salt but with cocktails... it works! The key is balancing with other appetizers!",
