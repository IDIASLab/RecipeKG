I got 3 great size pancakes out of it, and I added mini chocolate chips to one, banana to another, and blueberries to the 3rd. YUMMY.  All for 125 calories!!  Thanks so much for the recipe idea.  I can't wait to make it again!!",

                "reviewBody": "This was a welcome relief from having eggs and bacon for breakfast on my low carb diet.  I inadvertently poured all the egg into the cream cheese but using a whisk took care of the lumps. I do agree with another reviewer though and really like the lumps in the mixture (nothing like having a nice bite of cream cheese in this lovely recipe).   I held the butter (used Pam in the frying pan).  Then used the butter for topping and some Splenda instead of a sugar-free syrup since I didn't have any in the house.  Tasted like french toast with the Splenda added.  Great alternative to bacon and eggs, thank you!\n\n********Edited to add that I made this again but made one large crepe, covered the pan so it would cook through on med heat.  When done, I added 1/2 cup of fresh crushed blueberries mixed with some Splenda and rolled it into a crepe and topped it with sugar free cool whip.  A great low carb Blueberry Crepe dessert!  Any low carb fresh berry would work for filing, strawberries, blackberries, etc.  What a wonderful treat to have.  ..................Also last night I was looking to make something a tad different and used 2 tablespoons of sugar free Orange Marmalade (sweetened with Splenda).  When the crepe was halfway through cooking, I dropped the marmalade on top.  As it heats, it does spread some.  Rolled it up, dotted with the butter and topped with sugar free Cool Whip, a nice change of pace with a nice light taste.",

I didn't have time to wait for the cream cheese to soften which did give me some lumps but I kind of like seeing the lumps of cream cheese in my pancake crepe.  I used an electric hand mixer to mix all ingredients and it worked great!  With low carbing I get sick of eggs and typical egg breakfast dishes so I was really excited to try this and I was not disappointed.  Thank you!\nNote: I have now discovered that putting the ingredients in a small blender to blend works great and takes care of any problems with lumps.  It mixes it up into a smooth batter.",

The first one I made was a standard crepe size then I did tablespoons then 1/8th cup measures. The crepe size was a beautiful thing to behold but I really didn't want to struggle with getting another one out of the pan hence the experiments. The 1/8th cup measured crepes were easy to manage out of the pan and the size looked nice on a plate. You could fold these in half over fruit or jam and they would be a welcoming sight. Next time I'll add a photo; but this time they're all gone!:-) Thanks for sharing!",
