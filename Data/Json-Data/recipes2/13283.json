This is a re-creation from a dish I had in Puerto Viejo, Costa Rica at a restaurant called Koki Beach. It was pretty spot-on. It is advised to wear gloves when handling an octopus because some people get a skin reaction. Since I didn't have any available, and don't have any known food allergies, I took my chances and ended up ok and rash-free.",
