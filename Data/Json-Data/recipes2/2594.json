And my husband wanted a dinner made in the cast iron pot outside like when we camp. So I did use 4 small potatoes and I sliced baby carrots in long length. Only used one green pepper and half of the purple onion. I simmered the veggies with the chicken on top for 1/2 an hour. Then added the Clamato juice and cooked for another 45 minutes. I add some cornstarch water to make the juice thicker. Cooked for another 5 minutes. I did serve over rice. This might be a dinner to use when camping. Thanks for the recipe.",
