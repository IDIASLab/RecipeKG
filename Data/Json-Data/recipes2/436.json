I made no other changes. I liked this smoothie--it tasted very similar to an Orange Julius. My bananas were quite ripe and combined with the sweet/tart of the orange juice it really didn't need any other sweetener. The one issue I had was that it had a little too much liquid. I think I'd cut back on the milk at least by half next time. Then I think it would be perfect.",
