This time I didn't have any Franks Red Hot but a cheap store brand so I needed extra spice to make up the difference. I've gotta say I liked the celery seed! I never would have thought of that. I used celery salt since that was what I had. I also added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. This was delicious on some frozen chicken nuggets with blue cheese dressing drizzled on top. (fastest appetizer on the planet! (15 minutes)) If you like it real hot add some cayenne pepper otherwise this is a nice mild mix. Thanks for submitting John!",
