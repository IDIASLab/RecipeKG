I put almost 2 produce bundles of fresh cut up broccoli in a square pyrex dish (after lightly cooking the broccoli) that was the perfect amount. But for the cheese sauce (slighted melted in a pan prior to mixing with broccoli) I only put maybe 1/4 of a loaf of Velveta some small amount of random left over shredded cheeses and a WHOLE FREAKING 8 oz container (the little small one) of sour cream. WAY too much sour cream not enough cheese flavor. I put French's fried onions (1/2 of the big can mixed with 1/3 stick melted butter) on top that was good. I wish I would have put a whole can!",
