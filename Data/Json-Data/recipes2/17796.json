I didn't love this as is but I'll keep working with it now that I have more experience making hummus. For those concerned with the safety of eating this: It's absolutely safe and it's better for you than \"cooked\" hummus because it's easier to digest. The problem with the funky smell could have come from your sprouting method. Beans need to be sprouted in a large jar with a mesh or cheesecloth lid lying on its side (so the beans are spread out) in a dark but well-ventilated area. If yours were moldy it could have been because there was not enough air getting to them. As for the question of whether this is raw: It's raw because the beans are not cooked; \"regular\" hummus uses cooked beans and is therefore not raw.",

I did make an error though I soaked the beans for almost 2 days (changing water twice) and forgot to let the beans sprout nevertheless it was just as good and I'm sure the enzymes were activated. I also held back a bit on the garlic (i used one big clove) because I wasn't sure if my son would like it too strong since the restaurant versions we usually consume taste rather bland.",

The other hummus (beans placed in the boiled water) was not as strong at all. Some of us ate the raw version (poor baby didn't have a choice:)) and the others much preferred the one according to recipe. Great idea will do again if just to sprout beans for snacking! P.S. Flavor-wise the raw sprouted beans taste like fresh green beans and the heated-sprouted ones tasted just like corn on the cob to us! Really! 12/4/10",

Perhaps those reviewers had bad/old garbanzo beans to begin with. I have to admit that I usually make hummus from canned garbanzo beans as it is faster and easier but this recipe is by far my favorite when I have the time. I add different things to flavor it differently. Roasted red pepper is a favorite additive. Artichoke hearts and lots of garlic is another favorite of mine. I mix all the ingredients except for the water and add it last only as needed. If the texture still isn't right I will add a little extra virgin olive oil. I also usually add some ground cumin for more flavor. As a garlic lover I seldom only add 4 cloves of garlic - usually I add a lot more (about double that).",
