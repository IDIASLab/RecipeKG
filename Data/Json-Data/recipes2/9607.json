It was fantastic and so  light and fluffy and I love anything lemon.   I even added some  fresh blueberries in some of the pancakes and it was a great combination.   It yielded 18 large pancakes.  Had four for breakfast and froze the rest individually.  They will be amazing thawed and zapped in the toaster for week day breakfast.  Loved them even without any syrup.  Thank you Chef John.",
