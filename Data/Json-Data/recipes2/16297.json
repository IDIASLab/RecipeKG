(Hubs not so much but then that was a given considering he doesn t like stinky cheeses like Parmesan Romano etc. Even so he still scarfed it right up!) I had an Autumn Harvest special blend orzo I wanted to use so I substituted that for the ditalini. While it obviously gave this dish extra flavor it wouldn t have had on its own I have no doubt I would have enjoyed this just as much had I used the ditalini. The leek was a creative and interesting addition that along with the heavy cream and cheese made a really rich and delectable sauce. I served this with Veal Marsala and Sauteed Green Beans both recipes from this website.",
