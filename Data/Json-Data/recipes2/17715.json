I've been looking for something similar to one my Mum made up years ago and most other recipes have potato in them which makes them far too filling. I've tried this a couple of times now and my only amendments would be a) using a vegetable bouillon - I used homemade chicken stock the first time and it was too fatty and b) using whipping cream as it's a slightly lighter texture. It also needs quite a lot of seasoning to bring out the flavour which I prefer to add at the cooking stage. All in all a really tasty soup which is as nice cold as hot. Thanks!",
