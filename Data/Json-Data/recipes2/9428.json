I made it almost exactly as written.  The only changes I made was adjusting the recipe for 2 people.  I also did not use frozen pineapple for the sauce. I used fresh. I topped the bread just before baking with a little cinnamon.  It was delicious. Impressive and very easy.  Husband said, \"you ought to open a restaurant\" that is how much he liked it.  I made the pineapple rum sauce the day before and also the french toast except for baking as the recipe calls for.  Sunday morning, all I had to do is top the bread with the coconut and cinnamon, bake it and warm the sauce. I also served it with bacon and some strawberries. Try it.  This one is a winner.",
