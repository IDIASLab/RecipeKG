INSTEAD I recommend a WHITE CHOCOLATE MARTINI (1.5 oz godiva white chocolate liqueur 1.5 oz clear creme de cacao.5 vodka 2.5 oz half & half.) Place all your ingredients in shaker with ice and strain into a martini glass with a Hershey's chocolate kiss placed at the bottom of your glass. Dust cocoa powder on top and there you have it. This is the best recipe I have found for this martini and just wanted to share it. Apparently this is one of Christina Aguilera's favorite drinks at some fancy club so I searched online and made 3 different ones-not a cheap thing to do. But this one is a keeper that my girlfriends love to drink. The Hershey's kiss at the end of your drink is my favorite!! ENJOY!",

I think I might try this as a float next time and use club soda in place of the milk to make it fizzy. EDITED: I made this the next night the same way I did before BUT I omitted the milk and poured club soda over the top. Even better. It really was like a float like you'd get at a soda fountain!",
