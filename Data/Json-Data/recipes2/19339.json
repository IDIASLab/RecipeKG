I think it will be even better when we make it again with all the ingredients. I used sour cream instead of yogurt added the cucumber and seasoned it with a little garlic salt. So even if your short on ingredients you can still make it.",

I omitted the celery but did use the optional mushroons which I thought were great in this. I actually think it could've used a little more spice like it was missing something but I can't put my finger on it. The Scottziki sauce was a little bland but I ended up adding some salt pepper garlic powder and a little sour cream to fix that. All in all we enjoyed it and I will be making these again!
