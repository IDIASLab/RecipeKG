I baked them for 20 minutes at 350 and they still weren't really very browned at all. I then turned up the oven to 400 and it still took a little while for them to brown. In the meantime the chicken was done. It's always hard to get an even cut when dealing with chicken (in my opinion at least) and I think I'd cut these a little smaller so that kids could get a better bite of them. I'm not sure if the measurements of the potato chips was right on because I only used two half chicken breasts and I kept crushing more chips. I also think you need a really strong potato chip to use. I would not recommend Lay's Classics that I used----I'd think a stronger flavor with onion or garlic or ranch would be much better. I know my granddaughters would like something with more taste than what I produced. I served these with Honey Mustard II from this site. I'll give this a try with the little girls sometime soon. l I know they will like them! Thanks for this recipe.",

If you are using any basic chip that isn't super flavorful you're going to want to add seasoning. I baked them for about 20 minutes and the came out mostly crisp all around which was a worry. I didn't drizzle butter (maybe that's why I'm not as impressed as I hoped I would be?). I also cut the chicken into bites therefore I required more crushed chips. 4 stars is because this recipe would be quite bland without seasonings and even with them it isn't 'wow'. I prefer the Butter Chicken recipe to this and probably will stick to that from now on for baked chicken.",
