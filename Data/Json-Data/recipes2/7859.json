I kept the eggs in the broiler a little bit longer than normal since I am still getting used to runny eggs but still even with doing that the eggs were still pretty soft. Overall very great dish. Will make this again for a bigger crowd during breakfast.",

I cooked this in a cast iron skillet and the eggs although cooked perfect on the top ended up a little harder and a little difficult to cut on the bottom of the dish. Cast iron does hold heat more than regular skillets which may be why I had this issue. I loved the yolks running onto the potatoes and sausage. So good!",
