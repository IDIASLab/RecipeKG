Huge hit not just for the kids but great for me because I didn't have to cook and it used up a half package or tortillas I had in the fridge. They ate all four on their own. This recipe is so versatile that you could use any spread inside the tortilla and any mix of fruit that you wanted. What a fantastic idea!",

I cut the recipe in half to give it a try and since I LOVE peanut butter I knew this was going to be good. Along with the strawberries and blueberries I added some thin sliced banana that I had on hand. This was a great for breakfast \"on the go\" and the nuttiness of the peanut butter complimented the sweetness of fresh fruit. Very easy and very tasty!",
