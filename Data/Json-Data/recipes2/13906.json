I did tweak it a little since reading that some people thought it a bit bland. I first sauteed onions and bell peppers in olive oil until it started to carmelize before adding the beef to brown. I then seasoned the beef with garlic salt pepper and italian seasoning. I used a spaghetti sauce that had lots of veggies in it and used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. I also used penne pasta. It was soooo flavorful and was great with crusty bread.",
