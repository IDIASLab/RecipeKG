If you don't have Tabasco Frank's Hot Sauce works just as well. This is GREAT on taco salad as well as a dip for raw veggies.",

After sitting about an hour this stuff is already delish! I had a small golf ball sized red bell pepper and I used the whole thing. I also used an entire jalape\u00f1o sans the seeds and membrane. I had an old opened package of Hidden Valley Green Onion Dip mix so I used the rest of it. I don't know how much was in there. I added no hot sauce. I don't know how much cilantro I added either. I put the red pepper jalape\u00f1o cilantro dip mix and a part of the buttermilk in a small food processor and whirled them all together. Then added the rest of the ingredients. This will be my go to ranch dressing from now on! Thanks!",
