I made one change; instead of using bread crumbs or potato chips I used cubed toasted bread with 'I can't believe its not butter' spread on both sides (used a total of four slices). I also added salt pepper garlic powder and parsley. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised at the taste--especially since I'm not exactly fond of tomatoes. Hubby enjoyed it too and our two year old enjoyed the bread and melted cheese. I highly recommend this dish to anyone who likes isn't afraid to try new things.",
