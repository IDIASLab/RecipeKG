I had some leftover stock and veggies from my St. Paddy's day corned beef and cabbage and some extra cubed butternut squash from Costco taking up room in my fridge. I decided to search for a Chef John version of butternut squash and voila! Here it was. The only things that I did differently were to use the (strained) leftover stock and cabbage in the soup. I did everything else to a T and the depth of flavor in the soup was just spectacular! I absolutely loved the zing and flavor of the apple cider vinegar. I will thank you forever Chef John for all that you do! This one's a keeper.",
