Since many cooks are having problems with the consistency of this recipe I am thinking the best way to cook this is with a double boiler. If you do not have a double boiler set a glass bowl on top of a pan of water and bring to a boil; do not let the water touch the bottom of the bowl and above all be patient. The last time I made this for Chicken Enchiladas it was a bit too 'buttery' when I took them out of the oven. So you might want to cut the butter in half. 12/27/2005 I am adding this addition to my comments above on this recipe to make directions a bit more clear---DO NOT BOIL--DO NOT SIMMER---HEAT VERY GENTLY STIRRING CONSTANTLY OR WILL NOT BE THE PROPER CONSISTENCY INTENDED--if used as a sauce going into the oven the bubbling from the oven heat will not cause consistency problems many have had--",

I think the other reviews that were failures used the wrong type of cheese all monterey jack is NOT the same. In fact the cheaper processed cheese food version of monterey jack works better than the good stuff. Certainly do not overcook. You will make the milk fats seperate and clump... When i add the sour cream i just beat it in and didnt return it to the heat after that.. Then it is perfectly creamy",

I don't know where the last two reviewers went wrong; I think probably cooked it too much.  Actually, you don't really 'cook' this; you just melt it together, stirring constantly over very low heat.  Once it is mostly melted, I take it off the heat and cover with a lid to finish melting.  I have made this and kept it warm with a chaffing dish.  Keeping very low heat is a must or you will ruin a great thing!",

Plus I felt like all that butter was not necessary.  So the second time I cut it to 1/4 cup of butter, 3 cups of cheese and 3/4 cup of sour cream.  It was GREAT!  I added a tad bit of milk to give it a consistancy that we wanted.  The key is to put the butter on LOW, let it melt, add the cheese, on LOW and let it melt.  Then, on LOW, begin stirring the butter and melted cheese until it is mixed. This will occur, you just have to have some patience.  If you don't you will get a clumpy mess.  But that clumpy mess will smooth over time on LOW.  Did I mention you should do it on LOW??  ;-)",

He first melted the butter (but only used 1/2 stick claiming it looked too 'fattening'). he then added in an 8 oz block of the cheese (cubed). now...perhaps i should have read the entire recipe for him especially the last line stating \"DO NOT ALLOW TO BOIL.\" I could not agree more. what should have been a delicious sauce-like dip became a stretchy lump of cheese in the bottom of the bowl topped by a layer of melted butter. so please take heed and DO NOT ALLOW TO BOIL! you might as well stick to cutting up cheese and placing it on a tortilla chip if you do. it would probably be a tasty dip but do to error of the cook it turned out as string cheese in a butter sauce.",
