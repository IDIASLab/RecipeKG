I just put the mixture in a couple layers of saran wrap and shaped it that way. I only put in 3 T of oil and you could probably do with 1 or 2 - not sure it made much difference. I also only put in half the spice amounts and it was heavily spiced (and I like a LOT of herbs and spices)! It looked like it would be completely overwhelming with the whole amount. Also I totally forgot the garlic - no biggie. Double the feta would have made it even better. Also I made it a brick shape instead of a ball. After it hardened overnight I rolled it in black sesame seeds and served it with the Townhouse Flipsides Pretzel Crackers (the best cracker discovery ever!). YUM!",
