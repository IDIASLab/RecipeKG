I use cottage cheese, cream cheese (1/2 a brick, I believe - I'll double check)and bleu cheese - no sour cream.  I throw all 3 ingredients into the food processor and blend and then add finely chopped pecans or walnuts.  I serve it with crackers and thin slices of granny smith apples (soaked in lemon water to prevent browning).  A friend that loves the recipe has dubbed it as \"Cheese Goo\".",
