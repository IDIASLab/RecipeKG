I did change a couple of things instead of using ice cubes I froze my plain yogurt with the fruit mixed in and just used that. I did not add the flax meal. As written I did not need to add any more juice because the consistency was perfect to drink through a straw. Thank you ellenchild for your refreshing recipe.",
