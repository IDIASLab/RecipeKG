I doubled the bread crumbs and added some salt & pepper and still had to used a cookie dough scoop as it was pretty wet. I had to cook them for 20- 25 minutes. That being said this is a great concept and I'll be trying it again. They turned out well enough that I'm still serving them to company with a crab cake dipping sauce.",
