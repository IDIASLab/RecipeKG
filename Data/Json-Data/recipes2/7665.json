I think this recipe would be good as written but we like our salmon with some char on it that the grill brings. So, instead of baking in the oven I did grill it and I added some chili flakes because we like our salmon spicy. I made the butter sauce as directed except that fresh dill is nearly impossible to find in my area so I keep a jar of freeze dried dill on hand at all times. Not quite the same but not too shabby either. The butter sauce /dill combo is excellent and pairs very nicely with salmon. This is an excellent recipe and one I would definitely recommend.",
