If you have time sear then chicken on both sides, browned chicken breasts looks more appealing and it locks in some juices. Second, I always be sure to put in 1/2 the potatoes & green beans and then sprinkle them with some seasoning pack, if I don\u2019t only the top of the potatoes and green beans are getting seasoning. Then I add the rest, sprinkle with the rest of the seasoning and a cube of butter. Turns out great!",
