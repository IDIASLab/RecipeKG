I made my dough a few days in advance and just kept it in the freezer until I was ready, which worked out great. I removed the log from the freezer and let it set out while the oven was preheating. By then, it was perfect for cutting. The family is really loving these cookies...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Will round ones work? Broken hearts seem contrary to the spirit of Valentine's Day.  Also, after cooling  cookies on a rack for 5 minutes, why must I move them to yet another rack to cool completely?  Bouncing from rack to rack also seems contrary to the spirit of the day.",
