Mine was a little soupy, patting the cauliflower dry was not enough, the water needed to be squeezed out inside a kitchen towel. Also the texture was gummy, just like when you overwork regular mashed potatoes. The flavor was ok, I felt the cream cheese overpowered the dish. The last recipe I tried for these called for roasting the cauliflower in the oven which I think is the better way to go. I like the flavor better and you don't have to ring the water (and the vitamins) out of the cauliflower. Also the food processor was overkill, that lead to the bad texture. Stick with a potato masher.",

I slightly undercooked the cauliflower and the mashed blend was a bit grainy which is easily corrected by cooking slightly longer.  It paired well with a baked tilapia loin (seasoned with a hint of grated parm. cheese and some of the Lawry's seasoning salt) and a hodgepodge blend of frozen vegetables from Trader Joes.  We will have again when we're in the mood for something different.",

Update: another variation is to cook up to 4 cloves of garlic in extra virgin olive oil cut down the cream cheese to about 2 ounces and enjoy an extra garlic-y delight!",

We had it with a sirloin roast and a stir-fry medley of veggies, and it was great with or without the gravy. I streamlined it a bit: put the whole head of cauliflower into the pressure cooker for about 10 minutes on high, let cool a bit, then cored and simply mashed it smooth with a potato masher. I had an 8 oz. container of garlic-and-herb whipped cream cheese and put half of it in, tasted it and dumped the rest in. Sooo good! I did then whip with my hand blender, but I don't think that it was necessary and won't bother to next time. And that was it. No need for more garlic or any salt, it was already perfect. I did add some black pepper--but then I usually pepper everything. Next time my (grown) kids are here, I will make this without saying anything and see if they even notice - especially since I always put parmesan in my mashed potatoes  : )",
