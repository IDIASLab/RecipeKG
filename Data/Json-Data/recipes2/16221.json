The amount of lemon pepper is the culprit I believe for the excess saltiness in the flavor especially since the marinade liquid cooks down and contentrates. I made this recipe exactly as directed and it does yield nicely colored BLSL chicken. I made it because I had some vermouth and I was curious to know how it would do in cooking. The vermouth flavor was there but in spite of the amount it did not overpower the other flavors. I would recommend using ground black pepper lemon zest and salt as a replacement for the lemon pepper in order to control the saltiness of the dish.",
