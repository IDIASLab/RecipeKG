I also used gluten-free gnocchi and breadcrumbs. For chicken broth, I used a combination of reduced sodium and regular chicken broth. As written this recipe was salty and if I were to make it again, I would either use my own chicken broth or all reduced sodium and omit any extra salt. Additionally, the meatballs mostly fell apart. The final issue was there was a lot of broth and not enough \"fillers\". With some tweaks, this could be a delicious soup I could see becoming a family favorite.",

Before dumping into crockpot, first saut\u00e9d onions, shredded carrots and garlic. Added everything to crock and cooked for about 4 hours, stirring once half way through. Added spinach, gnocchi and half & half for the last 45 min -hour.  Topped bowls with finely shredded Parmesan cheese. Stupendous! Great hearty soup for a chilly day. Thanks to how easy it was, will be in regular rotation!",
