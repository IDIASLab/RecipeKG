I gave it only four stars since it needs a few tweaks (at least IMO) to get it from good to great. \nFirst, the proportions. The sauce given is enough for five large sweet potatoes. That's the perfect amount of coating. \nSecond, to up the flavor I added 1 tsp. of salt and 1/2 tsp. each of black pepper and garlic powder.\nLast, I found it needed to cook for an hour, not half an hour, to get really soft and delicious. \nOnce you make these changes, you've got a winner. Every member of my family loved it!",
