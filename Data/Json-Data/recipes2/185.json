I was surprised at how these puffed up with using the cherry Coke! I wasn't quite sure how I was going to cut the well out of the cupcakes but in my drawer I found this little citrus thingy that you are supposed to screw into a lemon or lime and when you squeeze the lemon or lime there's a little spout that the juice comes out of. That thing worked GREAT for pulling a \"plug\" of cake out of these! I filled each with 3 cherries and a bit of the cherry pie filling. I did add a bit more powdered sugar to the cream probably 1/8 cup more - as I really wanted the whipped topping to hold up when I piped it. I did pipe it onto the cupcakes using a pastry bag fitted with a 1M tip. I added a sprinkle of grated chocolate just to dress them up a bit. They turned out very pretty! Reminded me of a black forest cake cupcake.",

Neither the cola nor the cherry flavor are very strong so this really becomes a recipe you make to save on time or ingredients, but not really for \"cherry coke\" flavor. I made it a couple of times. Devils Food chocolate seems to pair the best. And I added the juice from the jar of cherries to punch up the flavor some, but even then it wasn't strong. These are cute, novel, and easy and they do taste yummy, but really just as a moist, plain chocolate cake.",
