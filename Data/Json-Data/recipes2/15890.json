We used this recipe one day when I was babysitting and she asked if we could have a real tea party.  We did sub texas toast bread since the princess and her friend of 7 and my 2 year old prince of a grandson are not partial to rye bread etc. at this age. We lightly toasted the bread and cut off the crust, then cut the bread into triangles.  We proceeded to mix the rest of the ingredients as to recipe and made finger sandwiches. Since I told the princess that you have to have tea at a tea party we used the instant russian tea recipe on this site, which we made and put into a kool aid pitcher then chilled with ice and served with our sandwiches.  They ate all the sandwiches and even liked the tea.  I must say this is one of the most rewarding times that I have spent with my grandchildren and we will now have a tea party every month and have decided that we will go around the world every month and find a sandwich and tea to serve.  So needless to say I will be a busy Nana on allrecipes looking for worldwide tea parties.  This is a great and rewarding way to spend time with your children or grandchildren.  Enjoy!",
