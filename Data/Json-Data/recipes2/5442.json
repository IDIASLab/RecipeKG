I then set the yogurt maker for 4 hours. Once the 4 hours is up I always end up with loads of whey which if left in the yogurt will make the yogurt stringy if you just mix it all in. I always strain the yogurt through a coffee filter to remove the whey then pour into a bowl cover and refrigerate over night. I always end up with really thick creamy yogurt that is delicious. You can leave the yogurt for longer than 4 hours - up to 12 hours (4 is the minimum though)but I have never noticed a difference in taste for leaving it longer. Therefore to save time (and electricity!) I generally only leave my yogurt maker on for 4 hours.",
