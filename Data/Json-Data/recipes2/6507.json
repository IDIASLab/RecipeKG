I've found that it's easy to add mini chocolate chips or chopped dried fruit or nuts or whatever you like... by pressing those toppings into the mixture after you've spread it in the pan. It's fun to do half-and-half batches this way and in the case of chocolate this keeps it from melting too much. I don't mind eating these when they're soft but agree with other reviewers that keeping them in the fridge improves their texture. Yum!!!",
