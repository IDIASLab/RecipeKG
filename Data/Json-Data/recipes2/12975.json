I made a few changes based on what I could find from the store, and what I had on hand. I could not find pomegranate syrup or molasses at any of my local stores; so I bought 100% pomegranate juice and boiled it down to a syrupy consistency as a substitute. That worked fantastic! It was sweet, tart, and very fruit-forward! I also used frozen corn that I quickly sauteed alongside the garlic before adding to the salad. Finally, I simply toasted my pita in a skillet until browned, then cut it into wedges. The rest of the salad I kept the same--and it was wonderful! Thank you for the recipe! I can't wait to make this again with fresh veggies from my garden!",
