Taste was just OK.\" Scrambley-low-carb/paleo/muffin-quiche ... these all have cute names, and they're so versatile and fun to eat. I'll make a dozen, freeze some and have ready-to-go breakfasts. I tried this particular recipe just for a change from my normal egg \"guts\" of sausage, bell pepper, cheddar, onions and kale and/or spinach. Didn't quite understand the step of blending the spinach/mushroom mixture, but I went ahead and did it anyways. Mine were also done in 28 min. in a 350 deg. oven, NOT the recommended 35 min. in a 450 deg. oven which I can only imagine would've obliterated the eggs into a dry, rubbery cup of yuck. These tasted pretty good, but I missed having a mushroom or veggie to bite into (I guess the chopped bacon made up for that!) I also didn't use the optional feta and instead sprinkled in Parmesan, along w/ S&P, as there were no seasoning/spices called for. Ended up adding a heavy splash of Texas Pete hot sauce. I'd make them again, but w/o the blender step, nor w/ the high temperature.",

I also used what I had on hand. 1/2 yellow pepper, 1/2 red pepper, 1 med onion, thawed spinach squeezed dry and a few sauted muchrooms that I had as left overs. I also added salad cheese (similar to feta). Salt and pepper. I didnt have bacon, but that could only make it better. I used a hand mixer to beat the eggs. The cooking time and heat was perfect for me and they looked pretty and stayed puffed. Since I didn't cook the vegatables the muffins were very moist. \n\nGreat option for satisfying weekday breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!",

Rather than mix all the ingredients together then trying to equally distribute I chose to place my veggies, meat, and cheese in each cup then I poured in the egg mixture....this also allowed each muffin to be customized so I made half with no meat. Add a little water to your eggs and this will fluff up nicely. Smoked Gouda was a delicious cheese to add a load of flavor!",

I added a bit of cream to the mixture and this probably explains why mine fell once taken out of the oven. They puffed up wonderfully, then plop! But they were still nice to eat. I used 1/4 cup of \"batter\" for each tin and came up short so I tossed in two more eggs and that made 12 muffins exactly. Next time I will cut down on the onion, maybe a 1/4 cup is sufficient.
