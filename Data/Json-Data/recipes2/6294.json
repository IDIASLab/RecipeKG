I've been making fried rice all my life and have never fed it to anyone who didnt die for the recipe.  A few tips though: before you cook your rice, wash it a few time to get the extra starch off, this will also help it from becoming mushy.  The best thing is to use leftover rice you've cooked the night before.  IT TRULY TAKES THE TASTE TO ANOTHER LEVEL, TRUST ME!!!  Also, we omit the snow peas and carrots and add slice white onion, and 2 -3 FRIED SCRAMBLED EGGS.  You wont believe the flavor!!!  Thank you Christine for rep.'n Guam in this recipe.  Hafa Adai!!",

Delicious! I guess the Spam & diced vegetables plus the soy sauce did the trick. I used 3c brown rice, as that's all I had already cooked. As per other reviewers, I added 3c cole slaw mix & diced scrambled egg at the end. I LOVE this rice! Did I say you should try it? Because you should!! And to think yesterday was the first time I'd heard of \"Guam\" fried rice or \"Lumpias\" (filling already done, just need to roll them now.) I couldn't cook at all if not for Allrecipes, it seems! I don't trust anything without a bunch of reviews & hints, and I love it!
