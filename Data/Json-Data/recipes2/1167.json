I think the dressing is a great addition to any salad and as another reviewer noted you can sub the crunch. I used rough chopped broccoli florettes and fresh chopped mango and navel orange segments instead of canned mandarin oranges -- didn't have cashews but substituted a trail-mix of toasted almonds & sunflower seeds and the crunch held up well. The mango just adds the perfect balance that the oranges alone wouldn't do. Also didn't have 4 hours to wait & chilled for only 2 hours so added just a little more ranch -- and it was fantastic! Thanks Jen!",

This is a visually beautiful broccoli salad and tastes good as well. The horseradish is subtle and adds interest to the dressing. I did not use all the dressing and less onion than called for. I also added the cashews just before serving so they would not get soft. After tasting the salad I felt it needed some kick so I added crushed red pepper flakes. Thanks for sharing jen.",
