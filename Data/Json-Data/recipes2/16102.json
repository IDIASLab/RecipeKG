I had to modify by using 3/4 cup ready to drink lime-ade and added 1 1/2 tablespoons of lime juice. I also added a tablespoon of sugar. It tastes like a slushy only better!(only drawback is the seeds) Of course you should be using frozen berries when you make this.",

Today I was looking for a breakfast smoothie so I added crushed ice to the blender until I reached the perfect consistency. I wouldn't think that two Tbsp of frozen limeade concentrate would be enough to give you any frozen texture so I substituted fresh lime juice. I would think you'd end up with a glass of tasty juice without the ice and that may be OK for some...just depends on what you're looking for. The fresh pineapple was a good addition and I most likely would add more raspberries and fewer strawberries if I made this again but that's just a taste preference. You'll never go wrong with this combination of fruit.",
