This is so incredibly good! I used a full 32 oz jar of sauerkraut and added a touch of brown sugar to the mixture. I also browned everything in a Dutch oven, then added the drained sauerkraut to that mixture; then just put the Dutch oven in the oven. It made for a one-pot meal and less dishes to do. And it seems like it's a lot of paprika (and it kinda is) but it's not overwhelming at all. I will definitely be making this again, thank you!",
