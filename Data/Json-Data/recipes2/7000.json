My only suggestion to those using fresh beans is that blanching is unnecessary - 10 to 15 minutes of saut\u00e9ing gets them pretty tender, unless you like them totally soft, which I don't. Otherwise save yourself the time and effort and enjoy this very simple and delicious recipe.",

Cook beans for 3 to 4 minutes or until crisp-tender. Drain beans and immediately plunge them into ice water. Let the beans sit in ice water for 3 minutes or until cool. Drain well and set aside).  Then I sauteed the butter, garlic, and salt, added the beans and cooked until tender, but still slightly crisp. Also added toasted slivered almonds.  Loved this recipe and will make again and again with these adjustments.",
