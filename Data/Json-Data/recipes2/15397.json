I didn't want it to be too spicy (lots of kids) or too dry unless dipped (too messy) so I substituted one can of stewed tomatoes with mild chilies (drained and very finely chopped)for the jalapeno. Since then several of the guests have asked for the recipe and made it themselves. All preferred it with the tomatoes instead of with a picante sauce for dipping. We all also learned that it works much better to make it the night before. I tried cutting it after an hour and then again the nex morning. It worked great and looked very nice the next day. Many friends have used it when they need something to bring to a gathering but want to be able to make it in advance. I even cut it and put it out on a tray (tightly saran-wrapped) about six or seven hours before the party and it didn't dry out and tasted delicious.",

I did add some chopped red bell pepper garlic and onion powder paprika cayenne oregano and some poppy seeds to spruce it up a bit. It actually tasted good with some seasoning tossed in it. I did eat a few... but just get turned off by the thought of having to swallow a mouth full of cream cheese. I guess I was very generous with the amount of mixture I spread on my tortillas. My guest did eat some and enjoyed them. Not bad but not something I'd make again any time soon. Thanks anyway.",
