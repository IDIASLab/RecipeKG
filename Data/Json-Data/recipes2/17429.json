After reading other reviews I mixed the applesauce with the peanut butter ahead of time then took the extra precaution of lightly toasting the bread to keep the applesauce from making the bread soggy. After mixing with the peanut butter it would've been fine on untoasted. I used honey wheat which is sturdier than your average white bread. If you'd like a less sweet PB&J sandwich this is definitely what you're looking for. Glad I tried it!",
