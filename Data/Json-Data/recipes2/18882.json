(Just kidding!) \nBut it is the exact same ingredients in case someone wants to make this and not buy all the spices. In their recipe though, they dip the fillets in melted butter, coat with the seasoning, and blacken in a hot iron skillet (without the oil or white bread). \nEither way it's very good. I served mine over a bed of brown rice made with chicken stock instead of water and added sautaed onions & mushrooms and frozen green peas. When served together it balances out the spiceness of the cajun seasonings perfectly!",
