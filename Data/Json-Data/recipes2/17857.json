First of all, there were 3 big eaters and I bought just 2 pounds of mussels and we had leftovers (maybe wouldn't have if they had tasted better), but 2 pounds for 3 was ample - not 5 pounds for 4! Secondly, boil 10 minutes and then lower heat and cook another 5 until the shells open?  You're kidding, right?  The shells opened within a couple of minutes in the pot.  That left the onion and garlic not cooked enough and the beer taste very pronounced.  Glad I didn't bother with the linguini, as the the broth was, well, broth-like and not likely to stick to anything.  We fished out the mussels and ate the bread.  First time I had tried a recipe that included both beer and red wine.  Probably the last.  Try another recipe.  At $4.99 a pound, mussels deserve better.",

I imagine not using the onion & real red wine made a difference in the flavor. I prefer a white wine base with garlic instead of tomatoe/red wine base.",
