The method of mixing the topping in the food processor didn't work so well for me; I think my food processor is too small. I tried pulsing but still ended up with sticky dough....tasted great but didn't look so pretty once baked. I also found the end result just a bit thin. So if I wanted to try this again I would probably add a couple of sweeter apples to the recipe and mix the topping by hand. Glad I tried it I did enjoy the cranberries!",

I have used Pam products for as long as I can remember, being disappointed by the quality of store brands. As you can see in my picture, no hard crusty sticking to the Pyrex baking dish. Makes for easy clean-up. Thank you Pam!",

Other than my eagerness to get it out of the oven before I had to go to work it was wonderful. So easy to make and will be something that you will serve guests who come for dinner. #AllstarsPAM",

My apples cooked to soft but still had shape and there was just the right amount of sweetness. I did add a pinch of salt to the topping when I made it in the food processor.",

I used fresh/frozen cranberries (about 1 cup) in place of the dried and also added a bit of sugar and cinnamon to the apples/cranberries. Rather than using a food processor I chose to just combined the brown sugar oats flour and cinnamon in a bowl and just cut in the butter with a pastry blender - as I wanted the topping more \"chunky\". It was delicious! I took this to my bestie's house for dinner and everyone liked it. Will make again.",
