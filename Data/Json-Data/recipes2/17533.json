I managed to get most of the crawfosh out whole (leftovers from a crawfish boil) so i gave them a rough chop & only sauteed them long enough to heat them a bit & get them well-buttered. The dip was very well received but I don't know that I'll make it again using crawfish. I think I would prefer it w/ shrimp although that may be due to the fact that I had to shuck all the crawdads. LOL I jsut served it w/ saltines...thansk for the recipe KSharp01!",
