Some of my favorite additions are (not all at once): Red Wine (makes it a bit more moist and adds unbelievable flavor) several small cherry tomatoes & White Wine. I also like to saute the sauce as instructed but then add the noodles to the skillet and toss while still heating. This seems to infuse the flavor into the noodles well. Mangia!",

But I agree with others I think it could use a bit more garlic (even though I did add more at the suggestion of others here). Maybe 3 big cloves? I also added a splash of white wine. I also think I might add some cracked pepper next time. Thanks so much for a great change!! I would like to add that my 7-year old daughter thought it was a 5-star recipe!",
