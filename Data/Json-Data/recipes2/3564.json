For one I think \"apple pie spice\" means different things for different people. I used cinnamon mostly but also some ground cloves and allspice. I couldn't find the nutmeg but a little bit of that would have also been good. Second I used way way more apples than this recipe called for and I still thought a little more would have been yummy. Definitely be liberal with your apples. I chose three varietals: gala granny smith and golden delicious. They went well together. Finally I think the sauce could have used some salt. All in all this was a fantastic recipe-- what a great combo! So thanks to the author for sharing!",
