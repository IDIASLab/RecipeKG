I added cumin oregano and chili powder to the sauce and it tasted OK. Maybe less mustard and more ketchup would help. I coated some of the chicken with crushed cereal rather than not. Regardless it looked pretty unappealing the pan and tasted a few degrees south of 'okay'. I plan to rinse the sauce & batter from the remaining chiken and recycle it into a salad.",
