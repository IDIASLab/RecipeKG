Creamed dried beef on toast or home fires is an absolute winner where I live.  A layer of eggs in the middle is a bonus! Somehow it didn't seem right to not have the toast or home fries. So I prepared a bottom layer of store-bought hash browns browned in olive oil. The little bit of crunch brought this great recipe home!",
