The hardest part was waiting for the candies to cool before cutting (I stuck the pan in the fridge to speed up the process)! Seems like the biggest complaint from reviewers was that these weren't very pretty. To get that green and chocolate swirl color you need to use Andes Parfait mints not Creme de Menthe. The Parfait ones have much more green coloring than the Creme de Menthes. Thanks:)",

I put the mints in the oven on top of the brownies for the last ten minutes and then spread them over the brownies with a spatula after I took the brownies out. Also for decoration I chopped up the extra mints and sprinkled them on top of the frosting when it was almost cool (so they would stick without melting). Hope that helps those of you who had problems with it. I highly recommend this recipe for school or parties!",
