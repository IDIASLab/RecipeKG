We served this over angel hair pasta as suggested (12 oz. of pasta for 4 people though) and I added a splash of white wine and a chopped tomato (that needed to be used up) which helped to create a delicious sauce to help condiment the pasta. Everyone enjoyed this even my picky teenagers! Will make again thanks!",

The cilantro and parsley work well together but the sun-dried tomatoes don\u2019t add enough to the recipe. Some kind of diced tomatoes might work better. Salt and Parmesan Cheese didn\u2019t help.
