It was nice to try a homemade spice blend instead of always using the seasoning packet. Not sure I liked the juniper in there all that much, but that's easy enough to fix. I cooked in on low for 10 hours while I was at work and it was fall-apart tender. I used a point cut corned beef. I'd probably throw some carrots in there next time for color. Served with some Irish soda bread on the side.  By the way, this is not enough food for 12 people; 4-5 at most.",
