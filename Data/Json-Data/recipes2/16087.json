I tried VERY HARD to find the kiwi-raspberry frozen concentrate and the Raspberry Creme soda because those things sounded like they'd be a wonderful combination with the raspberry sherbet. I mean I WENT ALL OVER A VERY LARGE AREA--I WAS A WOMAN WITH A MISSION!!! But to no avail. If anyone knows a specific store chain that carries these items please post it. I ended up at a Kroger where finally exhausted and frustrated but determined to give my guests something wonderful to drink and very comparable to this wonderful recipe so I found 2 12-oz containers of White Grape-Raspberry frozen concentrate (Welch's) and two 2-liter bottles of Big K Koolers Strawberry Kiwi flavor. My guests arrived parched and dove into the punch and they RAVED about it and the women asked for the recipe. My husband afterward said it looked like Pepto Bismal but we were all delighted at the wonderful flavor. If anyone locates the kiwi-raspberry frozen concentrate (which may be a regional thing) please post which chain. Thanks.",
