I used 4 eggs, 1/3 cup Becel oil, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup whiskey, 1/3 cup water.  I only used half a package of butterscotch chips and 1 cup chopped walnuts.\n\nI baked the cake in a bundt pan and when cool, I pierced the top with a fork.  I then took the reserved chips and walnuts added a Tbsp water and melted the chips(along with the walnuts) in the microwave.  I stirred in a little icing sugar and 1 more Tbsp of the whiskey to make a glaze.  Then I spooned the glaze over the cake and let it set.  It was scrumptious!  The glaze makes the cake - you get the whiskey without the alcohol being baked out of it, but only a taste!  Slainte!  Kat",
