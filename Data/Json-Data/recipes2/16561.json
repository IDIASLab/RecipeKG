Mint has a sweetness of its own, but a little sugar would be okay, if the diner had a desire for extra sweetness - no more that 1/2 teaspoon. Cider or malt vinegar can be used for the vinegar if you prefer. This sauce is traditionally served with lamb.",

In a sauce pan take a fist full of fresh mint leaves that have been coarsely chopped and place them in the pan with 2 cups of simmering water. Let it simmer on med.low heat for 15 min. then add two level table spoons of white sugar and mix till dissolved; then add three table spoons of apple cider vinegar and simmer for a few more min. Taste to see if you would like more sweet or tart and add some more sugar or vinegar to your liking. The true English Style Mint Sauce has more mint flavor and less tartness. Enjoy. ",
