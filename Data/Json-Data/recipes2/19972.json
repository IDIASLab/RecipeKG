I'd also suggest chopping the broccoli florets into slightly smaller pieces.",

I used chopped walnuts and raisins (as another reviewer suggested) along with grape tomatoes and those along with a good quality natural Italian dressing really brought the flavors together into a great balance. This turned out to be a truly tasty side salad that was enjoyed by all. It is also very high in nutrients. I will make this one again and again.
