The tom yum paste is hot, so try the soup before adding the chile and decide if any extra heat is required. Do not attempt if you do not have fresh coriander, as this is vital!",

I love the broth so next time I will keep the chicken and mushroom amounts the same but make 1 1/2 times the amount of broth. Also I'm storing the leftovers with the cilantro (coriander) and basil kept separately so I can add it fresh with every bowl.",
