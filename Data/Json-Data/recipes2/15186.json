For those that complain about the grease I suggest doing 1 cup mayonaise and 1 cup sour cream to cut down on the grease. You could also use reduced-fat cheddar cheese and mayonaise.

Very easy to repair the grease issue though-just get a few paper towels and sop it up. This dip was gone in about an hour. Thank you for the recipe - and Jamieson loved it.",
