The second time I used spicy Mrs. Dash and caraway seeds instead of the original seasonings, and they added a whole different set of flavors!  Next time I want to try sesame seeds. There are so many ways to change this simple and healthy recipe!  I used it for friends with diabetes as well as those who are gluten free.",
