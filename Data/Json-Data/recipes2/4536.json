I scaled to 2 servings to use 1 cup buttermilk in a ziploc bag and added all the seasonings except for the seasoning salt I used Mrs Dash garlic & herb. I let the chicken soak all day it the milk mixture in the fridge. For the flour I used 1 cup in a ziploc bag and added the seasonings again as above. I skipped the egg step I just shook the chicken pieces in the flour ziploc bag until totally covered. I fried the chicken thighs 2 minutes each side then kept them in a 350 degree oven while I was getting the rest of dinner prepared. I served with mashed potatoes corn and sawmill gravy my family really enjoyed this the chicken was super tender and flavourful. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #FacelessNoMore",
