The thinner you make these, the crispier they'll be, but you won't get that nice, layered, oniony inside. On the other hand, if you make them too thick, they can be a little doughy inside, so I try to shoot for something in between.",

Mine came out crispy but still a bit doughy so I can see where I need to be more careful when rolling out the final form. I had never tried a dough like this but I think I will even try to make these with very different things inside like tomato sauce and cheese or even chocolate! Because it s such a fast snack to fry up- and all you need is some dough ahead of time. Anyway this is a great easy snack recipe for me and the children!",
