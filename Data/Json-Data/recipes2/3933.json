In our coastal community smoked fish dips are served at most restaurants and many local fisherman have their own secret version creating a high bar for achieving marvelous accolades. The cream cheese base produces a firm spread and tends to overpower the other ingredients. Refrigerated this dip for about 8 hours before serving. The flavor profile better developed by the following day so you may want to make this a day before serving.",
