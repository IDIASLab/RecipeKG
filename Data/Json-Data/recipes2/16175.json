What is needed is a pure water soluble extract (the kind with alcohol) - adds more flavor doesn't fade out doesn't leave bitter after taste either (like I found out the hard way that the essential oils for making candy do!). I weigh the tea (I make big batches for gifts) multiple the weight by 3% add that much of the extract (by weight) with a spray bottle let it dry spread out loosely covered with a lid about an hour. For 8 oz of loose tea for example I use about 1.9 oz weight of the extract. Then add other ingredients like some vanilla bean some cardamon.",
