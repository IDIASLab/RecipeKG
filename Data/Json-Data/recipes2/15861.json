My youngest daughter (7yo) liked the variety of the cheezy layer on top. I used about 2/3 to 3/4 of the chili powder and mild salsa and her sensitive palate was fine spice-wise. I replaced 16oz of canned corn with a 16oz bag of frozen corn which made the corn sweeter and more distinct. Like others I also used sliced black olives on top instead of chopped tomatoes.
