What is particularly nice is the ability to alter the color and taste easily by simply substituting any flavor of jello as you like.  This is a nice blend between desert and salad since the cheese makes it less sweet and amazingly delicious.  I made it ahead by 2 days and it was perfect when it hit the table.  For those who enjoy these types of salads, this is a can't miss dish.",
