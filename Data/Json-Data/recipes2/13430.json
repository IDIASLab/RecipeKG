I also added some green onion including the green tops to add a little more color to this. I made 1/4 of this recipe (for just the two of us) using 1/2 can of black beans (froze the rest which works really well) Pace chunky salsa and frozen corn rather than the Goya products. I served this with Mexican Grilled Chicken (also from this site) which went well with this salsa.",
