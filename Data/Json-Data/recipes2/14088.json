                "reviewBody": "years ago when I was a young bride I received my first Braun hand blender with a recipe similar to this one--not as much sugar though--just 2 T granulated sugar for 2 cups of skim milk. The trick is to have EVERYTHING chilled in the freezer--the container (the METAL immersion blender attachment if you have it OR this can also be done with a standard mixer so chill the beaters). Also I would not change your container as this says(unless it too is chilled in the freezer)--the key is that the milk remain very cold and partially frozen. My original recipe says to freeze until there is a 1/2 inch ring of frozen milk around the rim of the bowl-I originally used a small pyrex bowl. Also I blended the sugar into the milk before freezing and chilled my vanilla in the refrigerator adding it as I whipped. The whipping should not take long. If you did not have success your stuff was not chilled enough. Also--this says use immediately and this is true--as it warms it WILL deflate--don't make it until serving time. Good luck all!",

After 15 minutes of blending at every speed I gave up. The directions really need to be more specific. How long do we blend before peaks begin to form. 2 minutes or 20? I am trying to salvage my milk mixture. I poured it into a bowl added extra vanilla to taste preference and it's now in my freezer. Going to attempt to turn it into ice cream or rather ice milk. Thanks anyways but next time just go to the store and buy cool whip. It will actually save time and even money considering todays milk prices.:-)",

It really will only work with skim milk and I also put my tall mixing container in the fridge to get cold as well. I own a Bamix immersion blender and the recipe book has stuff like whipped toppings to mayonnaise but it has speeds 8000 to 12 000 rpm so I think the people complaining here that this recipe didn't work just didn't have a strong enough mixer. Also - I add a few drops of vanilla stevia (amazon sells it) which really adds to the taste with out the calories",
