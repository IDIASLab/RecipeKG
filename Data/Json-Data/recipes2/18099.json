I used half a banana, the given amount of strawberry and kiwi and reg vanilla yogurt not frozen.  I left out the juice to save calories.  I added 9 almonds for some healthy fat(ya need to eat good fat in order to lose it).  With that it was a perfectly balanced smoothie that is a good jump start to your day.  I added all ingredients into blender with a dab of water to make it blend nice...then I added a cup of ice to give it a great smoothie texture. 5 stars for sure.  Oh and for the real health conscience..instead of yogurt go for the scoop of protein powder that comes in fabulous flavors.",
