When I want to feed a crowd I will increase the tomatoes to 28 oz add a pound of seared scallops(same way) in addition to the shrimp, and a couple of cups of clams or mussels.This has a complex flavor but is equally fresh and zippy!!! John does a great job with classic favorites!!! I love the way the seafood sears when the oil is tossed with it, instead of in the pan.",

Watch Chef John's video for tips you won't see on the written recipe, like drying the shrimp before seasoning it, etc...I found this recipe so fast to make too.  For those reviewers complaining it's too spicy, they have no business making this recipe--try shrimp salad instead!  Good grief.  The red pepper flakes make the dish, and unlike so many others, I DID have Aleppo chili, glad I was able to find a use for it.  It's easily found online, Amazon and other places. But the recipe is not hurt by not having it.  I prefer not to put anything like pasta or rice with this, I like that on the side.  That's how I roll.  I don't like the sauce too thick either, so I simmered the sauce for only 5 mins, not 10, so it wouldn't reduce too much.  But if it does, simply add a splash of broth.  This goes well with shrimp and clams added, mussels, etc...the sauce is a vehicle to let your imagination fly. By the way, I used more oregano bc I buy it direct from Italy on its branches, it is not anything like store bought, you need to try REAL dried oregano from Italy.  Since this recipe uses so few ingredients, use the best you can find...100% Italian oregano, 100% Italian tomatoes too, good white wine you would drink, etc....  Don't cut corners here, you can't hide bad ingredients in a dish that uses so few.  So glad I found this recipe.",

We liked it, but I think I'd use a little EVOO in the pan for cooking the shrimp (if not using cast iron).  I realized we didn't have any white wine, so I subbed a merlot and I subbed dried parsley for fresh.  THANKS for another well explained recipe, Chef John!",
