If I were to make this again I believe I would use strips of chicken to speed up cooking a little as it definitely took more than 15 minutes to cook. I would also add the basil later in the cooking process as it did overcook fairly significantly- I would probably add the mozzarella a little before the chicken was cooked through as well to prevent overcooking while the cheese is melting. Overall the flavors are great and this one is worth playing around with!",
