I had a lot more \"stuff\" than chips so it needed to be eaten more like a taco salad. It probably would have done better in a bigger cooking dish too. But all in all a decent recipe! I like how the chips taste with everything when you bake them in the oven which I've never done before. Be aware that this is a first day ONLY recipe the chips will not survive as leftovers.",
