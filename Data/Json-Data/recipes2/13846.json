It is wonderful frosting. I didn't use the rum ('cause of the kids) but other than that followed the recipe exactly. Smooth and creamy without being sickly sweet and fatty. I'll definitely make this again though I admit I'm still a little queasy about the raw egg yolks.",

I used 1 Tabsp boiling water instead of coffee and proceeded from there. Added more sugar to compensate for the NAS Carob. It was a great consistency at that point. I added maybe 2 teasp of extra water at that point so I could sweeten it with more sugar and I ended up with a sloppy mix that could have taken heaps of sugar to thicken up again. I only added one egg yolk (all that I had) and it still seemed to cope with that. Overall great recipe.",
