They were tender sweet and moist - perfectly done. I highly recommend cold water tails rather than warm if possible. The crab meat filling seemed like it could use a little spunk so I used about 2 T. of chopped red bell pepper instead of celery and I believe that was a positive change and contribution. I also added about another 2 T. of melted butter to ensure the topping would be sinfully rich and moist. With my usual consideration of Hubs' sensitive innards I omitted the cayenne pepper choosing a few grinds of freshly ground pepper instead. For the bread crumbs I crushed some crostini and added a little Parmesan cheese. Bottom line? This was excellent - not \"overworked and overdone.\" When you're paying big bucks for jumbo lump crabmeat and lobster tails you want to taste THAT not a bunch of other stuff.",
