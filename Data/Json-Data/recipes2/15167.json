Instead of using orange marmalade, I used frozen strawberries in sugar and a bit of powdered sugar. I have already been asked to make this again!! Definitely a crowd pleaser!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I used Nature's Own wheat and fiber bread and just spread the cream cheese on one slice, sandwiching it between another.  It held together just fine.  When it was done, I served it with tons of butter and a little sugar-free syrup.  Probably sounds gross to those of you not doing low-carb, but I really found it delicious!  The french toast tasted like regular french toast, and the warm, melted cream cheese made it wonderful!  Also very easy to make.",

I had a hard time slicing the bread just right and an even harder time fitting the cream cheese in the pockets. Second of all I just wasn't impressed with the flavor. It was kind of bland. Now I will admit that I didn't use liqueur because the thought of it at 8:00 in the morning made me sick so I used french vanilla creamer instead (like the submitter suggests). I have used creamer when making french toast before and it always makes it excellent. Not this time. I also ran out of egg mixture before coating all of the slices but had extra cream cheese. Also needed twice as much butter. But I will say that the orange marmalade was great it was the only part of this dish I really liked. Also here's a tip I learned: Use clarified butter to cook the french toast in that way it won't burn. Melt your butter beforehand and as it cools skim off the white cloudy part with a spoon and use only the clear yellow butter remaining. Thanks for sharing but I really doubt I will bother to make it again.",
