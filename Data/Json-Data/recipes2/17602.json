I added some leftover black olives and reconstituted sundried tomatoes upped the garlic and threw in some carrot matchsticks for balance and appearance. I like the distinct taste of seafood that you get but I think canned sardines are not substantial enough to provide the texture and spectrum of flavor that you expect from seafood pasta. My boyfriend said that it would be great without the \"mystery meat\" qualities of the sardines. This is a great base recipe and I think I may try again and add some rinsed canned shrimp or some leftovers from a seafood dinner. Final verdict: this is a nice filling 2 meal (less if leftovers/scraps) but don't expect the world from it. A word of caution: canned sardines will stink up your house when heated (if you've ever been to a wharf in the summer you know the smell). Prepare some scented candles/inscense if expecting company.",

Also when the sardines are in the pan you can either stir them a lot as they heat and they can turn into a mushier sauce or just gently turn them for more large chunks of fish in your dish. Either way- delicious! I didn't have any onion but I added half a cup of chopped fresh parsley and the parmesan straight into the pan when the flavors \"absorb.\" SO tasty!!",
