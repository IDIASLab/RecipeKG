My DH didn't care for it too much either. But I enjoyed it a lot. There is a skin on the cheese that didn't melt and it was a little odd but I thoroughly enjoyed the cranberry on it. I agree with other reviewers who said ham would be great on this. However I doubt I will buy camembert cheese again just for me. I did enjoy it's mild and creamy flavor and texture. I put it on Triscuits and put them in the microwave for 8 seconds and that was really good too.",

I used a little extra basalmic to offset the sweetness of the cranberry sauce. I found camembert in my local run-of-the-mill grocery store next to the brie. Although I love brie and can see it working in this recipe the camambert's flavor was more mellow and seemed to mesh well with the craberry sauce. DH doesn't like whole cranberry sauce so I used jellied and it worked fine.",
