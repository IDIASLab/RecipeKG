I changed it up just a little bit: I used milk instead of the cream, red AND green pepper, shrimp instead of chicken, and one 6oz can of tomato paste mixed with 1/2 cup water, then added just a little spaghetti sauce with the milk and the red pepper flakes. YUM! We will definitely have this again. I loved it with shrimp and will throw in more next time. Husband liked it too. ",
