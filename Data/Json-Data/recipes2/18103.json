I only used 1 yellow bell pepper, half a yellow onion, and lots of chopped mushrooms (I couldn't justify buying 3 peppers only to use 1/4 of it. We don't normally eat peppers), but it was still very good. Instead of corn flakes, I used smushed up tortilla chips. The smell of the chili powder, seasonings and chips reminded me of the chili cheese Fritos, and I bet they'd be equally as good on the chicken. Served with a dollop of sour cream, a side of yellow rice, and a salad. Yummy.",

I spread about 2 tablespoons of cream cheese on each coated breast prior to filling (versus the butter suggested by another reviewer) and it turned out very moist and flavorful. Update: after making this delicious dish numerous times I've dispensed with the rolling and toothpicks. It comes out just fine with layering the toppings on top of a lightly pounded and crumbed half-breast. I do add extra salsa and save the shredded cheese for the final topping. It's easier to prepare and eat this way.",
