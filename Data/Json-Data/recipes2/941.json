Pair pickled onions with meatloaf or sausages. Chop one of the onion pickles into a tablespoon each of sour cream and mayonnaise to make a killer tartar sauce for fish. Mix with a teaspoon of mustard and mayo and slather on a turkey and Cheddar sandwich. Or use them as swizzle sticks in a Bloody Mary for a special eye-opening cocktail!",
