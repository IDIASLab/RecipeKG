It's a very soupy dip so I suggest serving with bread not crackers. You will definitely want some pickles for contrast on the top. I chopped some dill pickles up and added them after baking instead of before like instructed in the recipe. We did enjoy the flavor of this dip and it's pretty easy to make so I'm giving it 4 stars.",

I was out of yellow mustard so used a spicy brown mustard and by mistake added the cheese inside the dip so I just added a little more on top. I don't think it impacted the taste. I set the oven on broil the last minute or so to get a nice browning on the top for presentation. We really enjoyed this dip. It's rich and filling but it was so tasty everyone kept coming back for more! We served on toasted baguette. I would definitely make this again.",
