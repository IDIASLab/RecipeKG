We modified it a bit by increasing the following;  16 ounces of cheese, 3 cans of crab meat, 1 1/2 lbs. of shrimp, and adding: 1/2 can green chiles, 1 small can chopped black olives.  We mix the 1/2 of the cheese along with the crab, shrimp, chiles and olives for the filling.  Wonderful tasting!!",

I also added a tsp. of cumin to the seafood mix & loved the flavor it added...I think next time I might add another teaspoon. The green enchilada sauce MADE this recipe...I can't imagine it w/ red. After baking the second time, I topped the enchiladas off w/ a bit of mexican blend cheeses & stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes to add visual appeal. Then I topped each enchilada w/ a tbp sized dollop of sour cream (they really don't need any more than that) & sprinkled them w/ fresh, chopped cilantro. These were really, really good but I think white corn tortillas would make a better wrap for them. They'd hold up better to cooking under the sauce. Served them w/ watermelon margaritas, a southwestern blend of mixed veggies (corn, black beans, onions, poblanos etc), chips & hot sauce & sopapillas for dessert. Fantastic dinner...thanks Lisa!",

I put a small amount on the bottom of the pan which helped keep the enchiladas from sticking and I poured a spoonful over the crab/shrimp mixture before rolling. The results were wonderful. FYI: The mixture nicely filled ten flour tortillas had I used all twelve they would not have fit in the suggested pan.",

The end result was a little mushy though I think next time I'll add the enchilada sauce a little later probably after baking the enchiladas for ten or fifteen minutes first and making the outsides a little crispy so that they wont soak in as much of the sauce. Other than that these were great and I will definately make them again!",
