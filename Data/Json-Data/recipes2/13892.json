The recipe says to cook on a griddle or skillet so DON'T even think about cooking these on your outside grill as I can assure you you'll have a disaster. I read the reviews did add some Egg Beaters in an effort to provide a binder and although I was able to flip the burgers it still was not a pretty sight. I used a Calphalon grill pan which is pretty easy to clean up otherwise I think I would have had a mess with the baked-on melted cheese. If I were to make this again I think I'd skip the cheese cubes (not convinced there was anything gained from this) and just add a nice slice of cheese on the top making it a real cheeseburger. As suggested I did use Teriyaki sauce in place of the soy sauce but I really couldn't taste it at all. But then who really cares it still was a delicious and moist burger.",
