But boy was I wrong these smelled wonderful while baking and tasted great! I did add some cayenne though. I also didn't shred the last bit of cheddar cheese and just thinly sliced it and laid it over the ketchup. I made Unbelievable Rolls from this site to use as my buns and Roasted Onion Mayonnaise to top it off. It was really good for something so simple. Thanks for sharing!",

You can't tell it's there when they are cooked. Also because my family prefers mustard to ketchup I will put that on the top of some of them next time. A really good recipe that will become a family staple. Thank you!",
