I did tweek the recipe ever so slightly for personal preference. To the filling, I only blended in 1 cp. of Cool Whip so that it would be a little stiffer. Besides the caramel syrup, I topped the cake with sliced toasted almond slices and marashino cherries. Wow your friends with this fun dessert!",

And used a bunch more cool whip on the top. We also didn't spread the caramel out between layers, as that would have been a mess. I instead did a generous drizzle.",
