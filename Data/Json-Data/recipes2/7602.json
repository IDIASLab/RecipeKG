I did a little tweaking of it because of the ingredients I had on hand, but the result was very similar to the original.  Since I only needed a couple of bites, I melted chocolate chips in a bowl and spooned  it over the top of the frozen marshmallow cream.  I followed it up with some crunched up lemon cookies.  Yum!  Thanks, Nora!  This made for a quick and very easy and adaptable dessert bite!",

                "reviewBody": "The s'mores flavor and the concept were both excellent! However the execution was where this recipe failed me. I followed the directions exactly except for leaving them in the freezer for 5 extra minutes before dipping. When I took them out to dip the marshmallow creme was firm but within the 5 minutes that it took for me to dip them in the chocolate it had begun to melt and ooze. I think this is the reason why the chocolate never firmed up either. It stayed soft and even cracked in places (see my pic). It could have been due to the warmth of the day but s'mores foods are MEANT for summer aren't they? If I ever attempt these again I'll be sure to only take a few out of the freezer at a time and I will pop them back into the freezer as soon as they are dipped. I must say that I was disappointed because they were not firm enough for me to take to the July 4th party that day so I ended up not having a homemade dessert to bring.:(",
