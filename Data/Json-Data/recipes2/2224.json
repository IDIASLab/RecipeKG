I don't, I've been making these exactly like this for many years, came up with the idea myself c.1980 (although I do prefer white onion to green here). I usually snub preprocessed canned ingredients also, but these are delicious. There may be other people that appreciate the idea of this recipe. Springboard if you like. It is disclosed this is a sponsored recipe from Hormel. I love these dogs.",
