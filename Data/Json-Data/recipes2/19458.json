It softened up nicely with the heat of my hands and rolled very well in just a couple of minutes. These little chocolates are very rich! I wouldn't recommend making them any larger than the 3/4 inch balls in the recipe. Maybe even make them a little smaller. I made the recipe as directed and the wine flavor was just a hint. It complemented the chocolate well but I will try just a little more wine next time. To decorate I dipped the top of the ball in just the tiniest bit of sea salt - these were a HUGE hit!",

So we started with this recipe and for Orange Truffles added orange extract and zest (to the chocolate center). For Rasberry added Raspberry extract. And for chocolate we added vanilla. All of these worked really well! The challenge we faced with all of the recipes as we didn't know how to melt the chocolate best or how to dip / drizzle the chocolate well (until the end). First I burned the melted chocolate a bit (really need to keep it melted on a LOW heat (remove it need be). We don't have a proper double broiler so we simply used a corningwear salad bowl over a boiling pot of water. Not letting the bowl actually sit in the water was helpful too. With the dipping I made quite a mess trying to use a fork a tooth pick my fingers...etc. to coat the centers. Finally my son worked with me. I rolled the centers and dipped the bottom half of the balls in the chocolate and placed them on the wax paper. He then took a spoon and drizzled the melted chocolate over the centers. This worked! Next year we'll have a lot more pretty truffles than this year's! But we will make them again.:-) BTW this made probably 80 truffles - plenty! With a little more detail for this novice we'd have rated the recipe a 5. Thanks for sharing! And Merry (belated) Christmas!",
