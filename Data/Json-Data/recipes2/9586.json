The second time I made it I tried a different variety by adding raisins and unsweetened coconut flakes instead of the berries. It was great too! I think next time I will use a different nut butter (maybe cashew?) and add a few whole cashews into the mix. LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Thank you for this healthy tasty and very simple recipe!:)",
