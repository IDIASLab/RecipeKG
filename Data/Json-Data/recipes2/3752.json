I poured off most of the cooking broth before mashing, added pepper and a drop of heavy whipping cream, topped with extra parmesan and baked in the oven for 30 minutes on 250 to try to cook off the extra liquid that you get with many cauliflower mash recipes.  I've never understood those reviews (on other sites) where people say their guests were fooled into thinking this was mashed potatoes.  It tastes like what it is, and it's good.  I found myself looking up how many carbs in 2 cups of cauliflower because that's how much of it I ate!",
