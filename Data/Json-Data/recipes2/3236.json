Using pesto sauce as a base is flavorful, but I found pre-cooking the pita bread for 8 minutes was too long; the timing may have something to do with the type of pita bread you use.  I ended up with a \u201ccrispy/crunchy\u201d pita pizza, so I will cut that time back to 2-3 minute next time.  But I liked it, it definitely is quick and easy to make, and tasted good for lunch today!",

I kept it lazy used a prepared pizza crust fresh tomatoes and sliced up a ball of mozzarella. I did use fresh basil leaves chopped garlic and Italian seasoning drizzled with olive oil and it was heavenly. So easy so tasty. It was done in 10 minutes.",
