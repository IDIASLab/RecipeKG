I was in \"blackening\" mode and was afraid I'd overseasoned them w/GOYA Adobo (minus pepper because I hate black pepper).  I scraped a bit off and they were fine.  We opted to grill the steaks, rather than pan fry because, well, just because.  I recognized the importance of butter and warmed the butter/EVOO/garlic/parsley and added to the top of the steaks as they rested.  Delicious.  We have filets in the freezer w/this recipe's name all over them....  THANKS, GOYA!",
