Hubby just got home from work and proceeded to eat three of them.  He said after the third one, \"I definitely need a glass of milk'!  The combination of the scm, chocolate, almonds and toffee work really well together in this recipe.  Because they are so rich, I cut mine in smaller pieces and I got 48 rather than 24.  Thanks, Mama Mona for sharing your recipe.",
