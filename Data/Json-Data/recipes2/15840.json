But this recipe was so simple, and the results were so good, that I ate two helpings! Everyone loved it.  I added salt and pepper to taste, increased the poultry seasoning to taste, used whole wheat bread cut instead of torn, and I also added about a half cup of turkey broth made from the neck, gizzards, and giblets.  Yum!  This will be my standard stuffing recipe from now on.",
