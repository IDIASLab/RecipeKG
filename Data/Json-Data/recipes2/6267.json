The only criticism that I have is that the beef filling was a little dry and needed a kick of heat (at least for our taste). I put a bottle of hot sauce on the table so that took care of the spiciness. I used \"medium\" salsa so using \"hot\" may have resolved the \"heat\" issue. In the future I'll add more salsa probably a chopped jalape\u00f1o to the filling or a healthy shake of hot sauce and a poached egg instead of fried. My hubby said he'd definitely like to have this again. Thanks LEMarr for our nice breakfast today.",
