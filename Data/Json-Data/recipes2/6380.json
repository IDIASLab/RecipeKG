Then I topped it with my toppings - tomato sauce, green and yellow bell peppers, Roma tomatoes, mushrooms, and red onion.  Then I sprinkled it with feta cheese (all I had on hand) and some grated mozzarella.  Sprinkled the whole thing with salt and pepper, then oregano, and tossed it in the oven for about 20 minutes on 350.  Sprinkled some basil on top and parmesan cheese when it came out and it was absolutely divine.  What a great way to use summer veggies.  Tasty and pretty.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!",

The only thing I did differently is slice the zucchini into long planks and bake them at 400 for about 10 minutes instead of grilling (I don't really understand how they wouldn't fall apart on the grill since the ingredients were all precariously balanced on the raw zucchini). Also used feta because that's what I had. Could not be more thrilled to find this recipe!",
