Warning though - I scaled this back to one serving an the topping was enough to cover 2 English muffins which when cut in half gave me 8 wedges. Garnished with tomatoes and parsley they are very pretty. Thank you!",

It originally seemed as though continuing to cook them wasn't getting anywhere with that butter but if you're patient and wait and take them out just shy of being overcooked the butter kind of \"settles down.\" Maybe half would be enough... but that also might take something away from the flavor.",
