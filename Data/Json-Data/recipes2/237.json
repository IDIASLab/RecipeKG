However a word of advice because it's something that I didn't want with mine a mound of grease residue. Make sure if you are using pre-made meatballs that you could them or boil them in water to help remove the fat before mixing them in this recipe. At least it should reduce the mount in your dish. I too added extra mozz on the top of mine but however stayed to the recipe otherwise. The family totally enjoyed the different style of dip recipe that this was. I think I might add chunks of pepperoni to the next batch. TY it will be a repeat offender in my house.",

Many thanks to John Brescio for sharing such a great appetizer and to Ritz for the video (great Video). My son went to the store and bought some things. He used frozen meatballs (Walmart Great Value fully cooked Italian Style frozen meatballs) as a replacement. I had some Townhouse cracker box almost full so we used it as a replacement. Otherwise we followed the recipe (added more Mozzarella during mix and on top). The outcome was fantastic! I think the Ritz Crackers would have been better since the Townhouse brand broke easily when dipping; tasted ok but not as thick and strong as Ritz). All 5 of us that tried the recipe rated it a 5. Also we microwave defrosted the frozen meatballs while cutting up the tomatoes and olives. We had a lot of meatballs left over so my son thought up another appetizer he and his buddies make; to put the left over meat balls into a slow cooker with Sweet Barbeque sauce and cook them for about 4 hours on high. They were delicious and he also added some frozen Cream Cheese Wontons and frozen Cream Cheese filled Jalepano Poppers with Rancho dressing dip and a Wonton dip. Thank you John again!",
