I kinda made it like a grilled cheese by spreading the mayo on the outside of the bread placed it (mayo) side down and layered cheese lettuce bacon cheese & then topped again this way the bread is nice & soft.

This is an easy & quick recipe!! I followed MC_MA's advice to the letter with the exception I used deli-sliced colby jack cheese. Also I obtained the turkey bacon from my \"almost-inlaws\" who live right across the street (MC_MA = I laughed so hard upon reading your review about YOUR inlaws this morning. Hilarous! What's funnier is my situation is the same as they live right across the street! Not kidding as they could watch us from their front bay window if they wanted. It is a mixed blessing wouldn't you say?). The \"almost inlaws\" eat turkey everything! Turkey burgers turkey bacon turkey nuggets ect...I was surprised that I couldn't even tell the difference (once it was in the sandwich)! Just like a BLT...only better with the cheese & mayo...and MAYBE just a tad healthier due to the turkey bacon (or maybe not with all the other condiments I added:)). Although this not the most original recipe for a sanwich I've had it certainly was good and filled us up for the game. Thanks Amy!",
