After cooking for the recommended 55 minutes, it looked great and tested done.  As it cooled, the cake fell a LOT.  The cake was very moist, and very eggy.  If I try it again I would use 1 less egg.  Because it is so moist, it doesn't really have any crunch.  It is tasty, so I might be tempted to tweak it.  I did not have any tub frosting, but I did have some homemade buttercream.  I only made and used half of the topping recipe and it was plenty for my small cake.",
