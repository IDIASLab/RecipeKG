How old was he deer?  Was it a male?   Shot during the rut? Was the deer  processed and field dressed in a timely manner and cleaned properly?\nDeer harvested way up north(upper Michigan etc...) will have a much stronger game taste due to it's food intake.  Deer that feed on corn, soybeans, etc...will have a much less game taste.  Bucks taken during the rut will be tough and have a very strng game taste.  This is all important in the cooking and the preperation (marinating) of the deer. ",

First you need to \"ice\" the loin for several days, then you need to soak the deer loin in milk till the milk is clear, you don't want all of that blood in the meat. You  need to pour off the milk then add more several times to get the blood out. I generally do it twice a day for 3 days. It helps remove the game tast as well. Then marinate the loin as listed. After that take the loin and slice it down the middle, place green onion and mushrooms(fresh or canned) then wrap in market thick bacon. You may need toothpicks to hold it together. Grill. We serve this up with what you would a steak. This is wonderful! I hope this helps! We are actually fixing this for Sunday Dinner this weekend. I don't add as much vinegar as they suggested, I do it by taste. Some like it tangy others don't it is up to you.",
