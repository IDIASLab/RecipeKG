Second, these cookies taste just like Italian Almond cookies, which I love!  (Even my very fussy husband thinks so.)  Third, they are the perfect cookie to bring to the hostess of a party I'm attending because she has celiac disease and these are gluten-free.  I watched the video and noticed that the egg white is beaten with the electric mixer until fluffy, although that is not mentioned in the written recipe.  Then the sugar and almond extract are added.  I don't know if it makes a difference, but that's what I did.  Finally, the almond flour is folded in.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use white sugar because I didn't have any coconut sugar.  I will definitely make these again--often.  Next time I'm going to try making them with Swerve so that they're carb-free, too.",

It also bakes in no time so as a last minute crave-buster this is a winner. I halved the sugar because I couldn't see why it needed so much and still thought it was too sweet. I used coconut sugar. One-half tsp of almond extract is too much in my opinion. In the future I will use 1/4 tsp of almond extract or may even leave it out all together because it overpowers the flavour of the almond meal. It is cake-like so it goes very well with a tea. And when you think I made it while I prepared my tea it tells you how quickly it comes together. Thank you HealthyRecipeNut for your recipe.",
