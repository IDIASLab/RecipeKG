I couldn't find any cheddar cheese soup at my grocery store so I used a can of cream of mushroom in it's place. I also took the advice of another reviewer and added a can of cream of celery soup as well. I used small \"new potatoes\". I microwaved them for a few minutes (5 minutes for 14 small potatoes) before I cut them up. I used bite-sized potato chunks rather than slices and it worked out well. I don't know if I would use the cheese next time as I didn't really notice the cheese in the sauce at all. Maybe because I used 3 cans of soup (onion mushroom and celery) that the chesse wasn't as noticable. Great recipe. Easy to assemble and to clean up afterwards. Thanks.",

One thing you can do to alleviate this is stick the potatoes in the microwave for 1-2 minutes prior to peeling/slicing, and thus cook them a bit this way.  \r\n\r\nI also used 1 can each of French Onion, Cream of Celery, and Cheddar, which makes it a little more saucier and keeps the meat covered well.  \r\n\r\nAnd it is very good with biscuits.",

Instead of a can of onion soup i used cream of mushroom and added 3/4 of a can of milk to soup mix. i layered potatoes then soup mix then pork chop repeated until i finished with a final layer of potatoes then soup mix baked according to temps and times then sprinkled with fine cheddar cheese. another great tip is to use just a little bit of cooking spray on the pan.
