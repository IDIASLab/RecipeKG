I did do a few things diffrently. I used regular canned biscuit dough (the store did not have the buttermilk dough) and the pre-cut colby-jack cheese cubes and instead of pouring the sauce on the puffs, I had it in a bowl to the side.  Next time (and there definantly will be a next time) I think I may add a little garlic salt in with the oregano.",
