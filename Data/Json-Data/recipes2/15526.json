I made a couple little changes - I didn't have any canned whole tomatoes so I used a can of diced instead and also I used the pre-crumbled bacon that you get from Costco. I did cook the pasta seperately first, too, and that saved a ton of time, so I definitely recommend that to anyone making this in the future. The spices I added, just for reference, were some crushed red peppers, regular pepper, and a bit of garlic salt. Oh and some minced garlic too. I think I would make it again because it's definitely quick and easy but I'll change something next time. Hopefully this helps anyone else that's interested in this recipe!",

I used about three pieces of bacon cooked in the pan first then taken out so I could wipe out the pan and brown the beef onion and about a 1/2 tablespoon of minced garlic. This cut down on some of the fat transfer to the beef. I then added everything to the large sauce pan and used the Healthy Requests Cream Of Mushroom soup and 2% milk. I also used a cheddar jack combo for the cheese because that's what I had on hand. At this point I added some kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. I used Barilla Plus elbow macaroni noodles they are multigrain and have protein and omega 3's. They did take a long time to cook in the sauce pan but I think that it probably made the noodles more flavorful than cooking them in water first. Overall it was a success even with my picky 2 and 4 year old.",
