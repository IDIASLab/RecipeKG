I did not have fresh basil and used dry and I used fresh grape tomatoes sliced in half instead of can. The one suggestion I have is instead of draining the artichokes and then adding olive oil, just use the oil from the artichokes. I know some artichokes come packed in water but in my area they only come packed in oil so it only makes sense to use the marinated artichoke oil. This one is a keeper for sure and it looks so fresh and pretty!",

One thing that I felt was missing was acid and I d recommend you give it a really good squeeze of either a fresh lemon or lime. I used lime and felt it really enhanced the salad. For our own taste preference I also doubled the red pepper flakes. Do allow it time to chill so the flavors meld. Love salads like this that you can make in advance and yet have lovely presentation.",
