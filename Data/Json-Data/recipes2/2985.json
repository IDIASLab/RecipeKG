Instead, I sauteed the vegetables, put the mixture into a 9.5\" glass pie dish, and then poured the eggs over it.  I believe the baking time ended up being 35-40 mins; I've lost track of how many times I added 5 mins.\n\nAlso, due to different tastes, I left out the jalape\u00f1o and the cayenne.  And since it was for my mother and she is lactose-intolerant, I also left out the cheese.  I did add bacon though!",
