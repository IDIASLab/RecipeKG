I experimented with this several ways, i.e. untoasted bread, toasted, putting the topping on top of untoasted bread and heating all the ingredients. All work but the toasted bread, cool toppings was best in our opinion. I also did a batch omitting the tomatoes and this was great as well. Love this recipe. Plan on making a huge batch and keeping it in the refrigerator for even a quicker appetizer. Very easy and quick. THANK YOU!",

Cut Roma tomatoes in half and spoon out seeds.  Lay halves down on paper towels to drain while making and mixing the other ingredients.  I used measurements as per the recipe and I used really good, 18 year aged, balsamic vinegar (that, I think, was key to making this taste so good!).   Next, I chopped tomatoes and mixed everything and refrigerated.  I made the toasted slices by brushing olive oil on them, sprinkling each with garlic powder and Italian herbs, then toasted on a cookie sheet under the broiler.  I let my guests spoon on the brushetta to the toast so they could take as little or much as they wanted.  I noticed the mounds of brushetta grow on their toasts after they tasted it!  Really great recipe; a keeper!",

The true flavor of the bruschetta is on the \"sauce\" that forms from the tomatoes'juices, olive oil, and seasonings marinating together.  To keep the bread from getting soggy, make sure it is well toasted, and use a slotted spoon to serve, if desired.  At our house, we fight for those last juices--to sop them up with a crusty baguette is Heaven!",
