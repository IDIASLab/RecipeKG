Or if you are just tired of r regular pancakes and want something more interesting. Mine were thick and perfect pancake texture. The only change I made was using sugar instead of Splenda. I didn't have the topping stuff so my review is just for the pancakes. Most people will probably put their favorite pancake toppings on them anyway.

This caused the pancakes to be a bit crispy on the outside so use flour if you can find it. I added chopped walnuts to mine because I love that crunch in my pancakes and also topped them with extra maple syrup for my overactive sweet tooth. Outstanding and so nutritious! All 3 of us wanted seconds and I ran out of batter and berries too soon.",

I think it was a good recipe and will make it again but I think with all things quinoa/cornmeal it's best if you let it sit for a while before you cook with it. Next time I will have this maybe prepared the night before so it has a chance to really soak up some of the liquids and pick up the flavor.",

Why use a packaged pancake mix when a healthy alternative is easy tasty & at your fingertips?",

I had added a second egg because we had some pretty small ones (farmer's market eggs don't always equate 1:1 with store-bought) and I was assuming this was supposed to use a large egg since the size wasn't specified. The cakes were very filling & had a nice flavor & texture. Will definitely make them again.",
