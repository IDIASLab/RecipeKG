I'm a purist), so I adjusted the instructions slightly:\n1. Bring 2 cups salted water to a boil.\n2. Add 1 cup uncooked long grain white rice.  Lower heat to low and cover.  Simmer 20 minutes.\n3. While rice is simmering, heat oil (I use olive) over medium-high heat and add chicken strips (or chunks).  Cook and stir until cooked through, about 4-5 minutes.\n4. Add condensed soup, peas, and milk to chicken.  Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.  Turn heat to medium low and simmer for 5 minutes.\n5. When rice is done, stir it into soup mixture, then stir in Parmesan and bacon bits.\n6. Stir well, then let stand for 3-5 minutes.\n\nI doubled this, then discovered I didn't have to.  The single recipe would have been more than enough for our family of 4 to have very generous portions.  Leftovers are great the next day!",

In the first batch I made it according to the recipe, with the exception of using a brown rice, wild rice, and quinoa blend. On the second batch I used the same rice blend as my first batch and I added fresh mushrooms. The only adjustment I had to make in both of my versions was to add a little extra milk for the rice to soften and cook the right way. Both were great!!!",

I don't use Minute rice in cooking so I just pre-cooked the rice and added it at the very end so it wouldn't get too starchy. The liquid ratio was just right with this method but I did use more than 1 cup of uncooked rice. I added some lemon juice at the end to give it more of a Greek flavor but that was just a whim. The flavor of the original (before I added the juice) was very good. I also cooked some onion celery and carrots in just to give it some extra vegetables. I don't think this really changed the flavor at all. Overall this is a very good recipe definitely a quick and hearty meal.",
