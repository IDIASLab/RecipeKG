Worcestershire sauce 1/4 tsp. dry mustard 1 bottle (12 oz.) beer 3 cups old Canadian Cheddar cheese shredded 1 Baguette cubed; each cube with crust INSTRUCTIONS In saucepan melt butter; blend in flour Worcestershire sauce and mustard. Gradually stir in beer; stir until mixture comes to a boil. Reduce heat; add cheese stir until melted. Transfer to fondue pot; place over low heat. Serve with bread cubes. This recipe makes less so you can have it for two and it tastes better because it uses beer. The older the cheddar the better the results. Add a few drops of lemon juice to help it melt.",
