We end up sending the recipe home with everyone.  Contrary to what some say, I think it is great the next day.  My advice is to cook the bacon and do the shredding ahead of time.  Then it's much easier to throw together at dinner time.  Even if you're skeptical, try it!  You won't be disappointed.",

Also, I'd recommend the cooking time be reduced to about 7 minutes. The finely shredded brussel sprouts come out much nicer if there is still a little bite in them--there's no risk of mush that way. I substituted turkey bacon for regular bacon. It was a big hit at my Thanksgiving dinner. I will make this again.",

Instead of shredding (like cabbages for cole slaw), I peel and separate each leaf from the \"head\" (like pulling petals off from a flower) and saute until wilted and not mushy. I think it looks nicer this way. I also like to add some thin slices of garlic to the oil for extra flavor, and so those who don't care to eat the actual garlic can pick them out easily.",
