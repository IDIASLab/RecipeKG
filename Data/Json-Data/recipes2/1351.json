Wait until the ball stage to add oil then KEEP PROCESSING until you get the consistency you want. The natural oils release as it is processed, and it takes a long time.

No olive oil because it interferes with the almond taste which I suspect is the reason reviewers felt it needed honey.  \n2. Lightly toast the almonds and let them cool before you make the butter.\n3.  Save tons of money on almonds @ Sam's or Costco (3 pound bags) and store them in the freezer. \n4. Plan on processing this in 2 (or more) steps with a cool down period in between where you shut off the engine so that you don't burn out your food processor. My Cuisinart is a work horse, but I still had to do that.\n5. I will freeze my very big batch of this in 1 pint canning jars.",

Not too creamy and is a nice medium texture between creamy and crunchy peanut butter. The store I get my nuts from was out of plain toasted almonds so I substituted them with lime-toasted almonds and my olive oil was extra-virgin Spanish. I also added half a tsp of unrefined sugar. The butter is sweet slightly crunchy with a slight tangy lime hint. A lovely recipe overall.",

If you stop as the recipe suggests here the mixture will be dry and somewhat bitter. If you go on another 5-8 minutes the almonds will warm a bit more and release much more oil. The whole thing becomes sweet and creamy and no additional oil is needed. Scrape the sides of the bowl every couple of minutes early on and then break up the big ball that forms a few times. Have patience you will be rewarded.",
