I also cut the sandwiches to fit the pan. I did not bother with the chocolate pudding mix in the Cool Whip - and it was not missed - at all. I used nearly 2x the peanut butter called for (in 2 layers), all the hot fudge and caramel sauce (one layer, each), and mini Reese's cups (one layer). I did the first layers as called for (not measuring the peanut butter), then, as I saw I was running out of room, I did another layer of peanut butter and topped with the last layer of Cool Whip.  This got raves at a rehearsal dinner (= [I put it in the fridge when we started serving dinner, so it would soften a bit, after reading Frauline's note.] Oh! It took one box and a few extra of the mini sandwiches for the single layer - 18 mini's to a box . . .",
