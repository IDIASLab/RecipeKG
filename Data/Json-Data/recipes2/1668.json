She said it was basic Italian bread, but had some cornmeal in it, and was one of her favorites. I love to play food detective, so I took her description and went to work. I believe this is pretty close to what she remembers, and even if it's a bit off, it was still delicious.",

I checked it at 26 minutes turned it over and thumped the bottom and because the color was a dark brown I determined that it had baked long enough. The crust is great (crunchy)and the inside is nice and tender. It hasn't cooled yet and the loaf is half gone. It will never make it until tomorrow. Every once in awhile that Chef John does comes up with a good one. Another thing. The proofing times. I think they are for all purpose flour. I used bread flour like the recipe calls for and the first raising time was more than doubled in 1 hour. I let the loaf raise for 30 minutes and popped it in the oven. It turned out great.",
