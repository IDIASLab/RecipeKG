Mine had a tiny bit of dryness on the very bottom of the casserole dish, but that was ok.  We are having company tomorrow for brunch and this is going to be the star of the morning for sure!!!!",

I increased the recipe proportionally, and it was slightly deeper; I also refrigerated it.  I used 1% milk and whey low sugar alternative.  This sliced up into a lovely low-calorie 'dessert' but I actually find I love it for a cold breakfast in summer.  I love custard and pudding so this was right up my alley.  I tried the same recipe with bing cherries and strawberries, which were more trouble and not really as good as the blueberries.   Incredibly easy and delicious.  When I make it with blueberries, I use a little lemon zest and nutmeg with the vanilla and the fragrance while it bakes is intoxicating.",
