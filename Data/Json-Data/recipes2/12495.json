It can be a bit tedious filling the shells so next time (and yes there will be a next time) I'll pipe the filling in. I made these ahead of time w/no issue. We didn't use them all so I froze the extras in the Phyllo tart trays in a Ziploc for future use. Good stuff! Surprisingly I actually preferred the tray I made bacon-less to the ones topped w/bacon bits. THANKS for a great appetizer recipe Jessina!",

I wasn't sure of the translation from fresh jalapenos to jarred, but I used too much (5 tablespoons) and they were delicious but just a tiny bit too spicy for my (and a few others at our party's) taste. Will definitely make these again, probably with 3 tablespoons of diced jalapenos. I wasn't sure what \"hot pepper sauce\" was (hot sauce?), but we had an open bottle of Footy's wing sauce and I used that, and it was great. We served it with habanero jelly (not very spicy on its own), and the sweetness combined with the spiciness is amazing! Love this recipe - they are addicting and definitely beware of the molten factor when they first come out of the oven!!",
