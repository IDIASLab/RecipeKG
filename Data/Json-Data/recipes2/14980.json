I used higher heat for both the sausages and apples so that speeded up the preparation. I also used 15 grain bread that made a crunchy and substantial sandwich. I decided to just put the maple syrup in a small container and dip my sandwich into it. Don't try it it doesn't work very well and the contents of the sandwich fall out.",

The only thing I did different was to add cinnamon to the apples use pre-cooked sausage links that just have to be heated up & double the whole recipe for 2 people. Maybe we eat a lot but that is not enough food for 2 people. It is also longer than 5 mins prep time no one will have the apples ready so they should be included in the prep time which brings it to about 10 mins. I made this on homemade bread from my breadmaker. My husband laughed at the odd combination the first time I made it but I have made it several times since & he loves it (I just didn't get around to reviewing it). Thanks a bunch. EDIT: I have made this every weekend since. I crave this sandwich all the time. I want to try it with egg sometime instead of apple. You must try this recipe!",
