The batter is creamy and easy to work with and the proportions of ingredients are right on. For those of you who are interested in creating the rings try this: pour 1/3 of the white batter into the pan and gently tilt pan to allow batter to cover the bottom. Pour 1/3 chocolate batter just into the CENTER of the white batter and allow that circle of batter to spread and widen a bit. Then pour another 1/3 white batter into the CENTER of the chocolate circle and allow that to spread a bit. Repeat with remaining batter. I hope that helps!",

Unless you really like the taste of tofu for dessert I would recommend increasing the cocoa and making the cheesecake all chocolate. Also I did not know what demanara sugar was simply used granulated sugar (1 cup instead of 1 1/2). I think a regular graham cracker crust would be just as good as the almond/whole wheat one. Very good recipe for not using dairy products though!",

It was extremely dense and moist. I opted to use a cookie dough crust instead of the suggested crust. I started off mixing all of the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid but the mixture was too lumpy so I used my hand blended and pureed the whole mixture. I used regular brown sugar. I used the reviewer \"foodaholic\"'s suggestion of how to make the chocolate and vanilla swirls - I kept half the batter white and added chocolate to the other half. I poured a cup of white batter into the center of the pan and then a cup of chocolate batter right in the center of the white batter. I repeated this making sure not to wiggle or jiggle the pan or the colors would blend. I baked the cheesecake for the suggested time. I was nervous when I took it out after 75 minutes - as the cake was very jiggly in the middle but I refrigerated it over night and the cake set beautifully! I pressed mini chocolate chips into the sides of the cheese cake.",
