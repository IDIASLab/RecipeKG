The method is right on at 30 minutes I could smell the roasted aroma coming from the oven. The cauliflower was browned perfectly remaining tender enough to cut with a fork but not mushy. I didn't have garlic powder so I used fresh garlic and I had to improvise on the cheese. Thank you for the recipe.",

This recipe doesn't taste as good without all the ingredients so if you have spice weenies or small children (like I do) at your house you might have to make your own batch. I will also add that milk really does compliment this dish well. I really enjoyed the combination. It's like a fireworks show in your mouth. But don't worry. It's a small tykes firework show. We aren't talking atomic bomb over here. One slight change I'd make for next time mainly to take advantage of the cheese coverage is to make the cauliflower pieces smaller. They really need to be bite sized no larger than a half dollar size. This will help ensure the cheese sriracha and onions don't slide off and that you can get all the flavors incorporated into one bite. Great job Brian!",
