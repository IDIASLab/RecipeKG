The flavor is wonderful!  I used a small scoop to drop the cookies onto the cookie sheet.  The cookies did not spread at all...they stayed dome-like.  Had to flatten the next batch before baking so they weren't so high and cake-like.  Easy to make and simple ingredients for a flavorful cookie.  Will bake them again.",
