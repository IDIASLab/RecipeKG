I will bake it in a sheet pan next time & cut in small squares. For the glaze I used some juice from a jar of cherries rather than water. The juice made it a pretty pink color. Since it was for Easter I sprinkled the cake with coconut and decorated with some jellybeans. Thanks for sharing your yummy & easy recipe Randy!",

I made my own cherry pie filling from two cans of dark cherries I had in my pantry (bought cheap last week for.99 a can at Grocery Outlet) with water lemon juice sugar a bit of vanilla extract and cornstarch. When I made the glaze I added a tablespoon of butter and a pinch of salt just like Grandma taught me for a quick glaze. I was able to use a boxed cake mix I had for a while that I really wanted to jazz up and two cheap cans of cherries which helps me in the long run when we move in a couple months. I appreciate you sharing your dessert Randy. This was great with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Next time I might take Lilcat's suggestion and use either grenadine or marachino cherry juice to make the glaze instead of almond extract. I think that's a fabulous idea.",
