They are very moist on the inside but outside is very normal and easy to flip. Added a pinch of salt, and a little cinnamon. Next time I will add alittle more than 1/3 cups of  Oats and see if inside gets a little less soggy. \n\nUpdate: 1/2 cup of Oats (ground finely before adding other ingredients) really made a great difference. I make these regularly now! THANKS!",

If you can't have milk or wheat these will make you very happy. I added 1/2 cup of quick oats instead of 1/3 as indicated by another reviewer and these were not mushy by any stretch of the imagination! Keep in mind these are not made with the traditional ingredients of regular pancakes so don't expect them to taste like regular pancakes! That being said they were very moist tasty and the hint of banana flavor was fantastic.",

Once it was mixed up in the blender i let the batter sit for a few mins. to thicken up a bit then added the blueberries just before cooking. They are so delicious no maple syrup is needed although i did drizzle with some pure Canadian maple syrup! i will definitely be making these again. Thanksamunch greaterexp3 for a most delicious recipe!",
