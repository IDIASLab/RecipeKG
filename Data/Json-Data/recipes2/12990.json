It held up nicely and tasted wonderful.",

I used fresh whipped cream instead of \"frozen whipped topping\". I read the ingredients list of whipped toppings and they contain a lot of thickeners so this may have contributed to mine not setting. I also used homemade pumpkin pie filling. I even tried adding gelatin and that didn't help. After 6 hours in the fridge it was runny. I have now put it in the freezer and have decided to treat it like an ice cream treat. It tastes good. It is like a pumpkin pie mousse. The only thing is I ate it with a spoon. Thanks Karaoke Ken for the recipe, I will try it again with some thickeners the next time.",

I made it twice for Thanksgiving get-together and they both turned out great and were a hit multiple request for recipe. I only had plain canned pumpkin so I used it rather than going to the store for pie filler I added pumpkin pie spice for taste. I also added an additional 8 oz cream cheese to give it a stronger cheesecake taste. Due to not wanting to freeze it I added 1 pkt of gelatin. The consistency was great and was not runny at all. I served them in individual cups with ginger snaps as the crust. I also make my own whipped cream and made it very stiff.",
