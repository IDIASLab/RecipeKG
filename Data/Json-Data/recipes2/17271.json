I have made this version a couple of times and I think it's pretty good. It tastes like BBQ'd beans. It's easy and I made it even easier by using dried parsley flakes instead of fresh. I also put in a Tbsp. of dried chopped onion. Also I would suggest keeping the heat down VERY low just so it barely bubbles and stir it fairly often to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pan (I also advise to use a large pot rather than a skillet to make stirring easier). It comes out rather thick and cooks quite awhile so that's why frequent stirring is important. It is a very filling recipe and is good with the shredded cheddar cheese on top.",
