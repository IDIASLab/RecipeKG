You can also control how long you cook the mixture before it's presented. I hear from my friends in Northern Italy that they use twice as much anchovy and garlic as I did. Serve in a small chafing dish or fondue pot with crusty bread, roasted carrots, blanched asparagus, endive, red peppers, and/or roasted potatoes.",

I also cooked it with some sliced onion in the mixture and then strained the oil out. I served it with roasted root vegetables, artichokes and crudetts. Of course, the four stars accounts for our variations and preferences (which almost seems unfair due to the wide range of variance of this dressing). So good!",

The guys would all be set up on the back deck making their individual concoctions, and everyone would bring various veggies, leftover meat, and crusty breads. I absolutely cannot stand anchovies, but I love this dish. However, everyone in our group always used quite a bit more garlic.",
