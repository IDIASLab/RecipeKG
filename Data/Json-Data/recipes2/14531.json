Tasted delicious but didn't look nice -- sort of \"cottage-cheesy\" on the top -- I think it was the butterfat. Frequent stirring didn't help much -- Used Edie's Grand brand ice-cream (only one I could find) but high fat content. Has anyone seen a low-fat peppermint ice-cream? Not usually a substitution I make for parties but it might help the texture. Any other suggestions? HELP I have another party on Monday;-)",
