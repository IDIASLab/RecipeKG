I fully intend to try it as written because I really WAS intending to make something with Apples and Puff; but today I took the filling from Sunny\u2019s Football (google) and a square brownie pan to create individual bites with a pear, Brie, pecans, PLUS dry salami, mild pepper jelly, sharp cheddar, salt and pepper to make larger more savory mini pies. Thanks so much for the inspiration!",
