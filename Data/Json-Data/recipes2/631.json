Having the browned cheese with the gooey cheese and the buttery crispy bread, is the perfect meal for any time of the day, but use an especially non stick pan, and if not up the butter if you want the cheese to stay intact. We use all sorts of different cheese, like of course American, Swiss, Pepperocini cheese, Fresh Mozzarella, and the list continues. Sometimes we add fresh tomato, but season first with salt and pepper, or ham, or bacon. I especially like Baby Swiss with Dijon mustard, and crispy pickles chips.  Enjoy!",

Cheddar on the outside all the way though! And I applaud you for sharing what others consider 'simple' recipes.
