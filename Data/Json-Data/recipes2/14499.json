There is just no other way to describe this sauce other than it was a sort of chunky odd-colored creamy mush definitely not something I wanted to photograph. But boy oh boy did this TASTE good! Hubs and I both loved it and believe it or not weird combination as it is he actually requested that I pack the leftovers in his lunch tomorrow along with his rotisserie chicken sandwich! We just loved the rich earthy flavor of this tho' that was helped along with a specialty porcini mushrom orzo blend rather than farfalle. I found the flour to be totally unnecessary and didn't use it. In fact I even found I wanted to add a little more half-and-half just before serving. Creative idea tasty and compatible ingredients and simply delicious even tho' you'd never expect it from the looks of it!",
