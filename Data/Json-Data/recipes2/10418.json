I do like something a little crunchy in my salads, so I added some cashews.  I used the \"Poppy Seed Dressing I\" recipe from this site.",

Thanks to all of you for reviewing; glad to hear there are so many who love it as much as we do! For those who have struggled with how I worded the prep for the grapefruit, I have tried to edit this recipe to no avail. What I would like to suggest (as other cooks have) is that one needs to scoop out the sections of grapefruit as you would if you were normally eating a grapefruit half. I.e., separate the fruit from the membrane with a grapefruit knife and remove it from the rind. When I ate this for the first time, my friend who prepared it said she used the stuff out of the jar, which obviously does not have any membrane or white pith. I guess this just seemed obvious to me as that membrane is so tough and the white pith of the rind is terribly bitter. (Who eats *that* part??)  I guess I just thought \"peeled\" covered that, but I can see where that might be confusing if you were thinking of it like peeling an orange. And by all means, use a homemade dressing! That's an easy substitution, but maybe a bit more time--which is always stretched thin during the holidays. ;-)",
