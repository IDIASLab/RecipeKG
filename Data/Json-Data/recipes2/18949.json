I think the stated times would work if you pan-seared the side of the steak flat before rolling... but the tradeoff there is that the steak shrinks a bit, and I don't necessarily think that is preferable.  So, I say all that to say that I left the rolls in the oven for 15-18 minutes, turning twice.  \n\nAnd, although I'm sure that most of you experts will do this naturally, I felt lucky that someone suggested to me that I soak the toothpicks first so they did not burn.  I also used the 3-4 toothpicks, evenly spaced, in each roll so that I could easily cut them and put them on trays to serve.   ",
