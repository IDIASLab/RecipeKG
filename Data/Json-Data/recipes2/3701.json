My family just loves them!  I do have to admit that one family member who shall remain nameless asked me to make some without the chocolate chips!  So another batch will be on the way soon.  Mine looked exactly like what the description predicted:  very thin, crispy on the edges, and very buttery!  Thanks, Chef John--once again!",

Mine did not spread like Chef John's, but I used a cookie scoop and did not flatten them at all.  10 minutes at 375 was perfect for a crisp edge and soft middle.  I did use unsalted butter and I am a salt lover but these had a very salty bite to them.  I would back down the Kosher salt to  3/4 to 1 tsp.  \nThe dough was a bit difficult to deal with chilled in the bowl.  (Very stiff) Next time I would scoop the dough, with a cookie scoop into balls first and then refrigerate.  Then bake the chilled balls.

I baked a batch that wasn't chilled and another that was and used the same scooper as shown in video.  Both turned out moderate thickness (not so thin as pictured) but spread evenly (no lump or cakey-ness as others described).  In my oven they took 2 minutes longer than instructed.  For me these were perfection:  crispy bottom and edges with chewy, gooey goodness on top.  Ghirardelli chocolate chips were amazing in these and the dough was delicious too.  Thrilled!

The texture was just fine to roll into ping-pong ball sized balls. I slightly flattened the balls before baking.  As other reviews experienced, they did not flatten-out as suggested in the recipe.   Everyone's oven is different. I have a steam oven by Kitchen Aide.  My cookies only took 10 minutes to achieve a crunchy edge and a soft, chewy center.  My comments are definelty not negative toward the recipe itself.  The flavour is fantastic!  This is why Chef John receives 5 stars for this completely nummy cookie!",
