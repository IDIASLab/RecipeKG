I had a hard time *finding* any of the seasonings and had to resort to pressing my bread into the plate, resulting in a super soaked bite (w/some flavor, though).  I was also surprised to find it a bit salty, which is something I rarely if ever, say.  This is a recipe to use your good EVOO for, for sure, as oil quality will make a marked difference.  While it probably won't be a repeater at the LTH house, YOU should still give it a try for sure.  THANKS for the recipe!",

Then, after I poured the oil into my dipping bowl, I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top before dipping my bread. OMG! This was the best thing I\u2019ve eaten in some time!",
