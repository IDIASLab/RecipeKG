Helped it some but I would not eat it again (my boys liked it alright but the hubby and I said no.) I'd cook the chicken again. The spare sauce will be stored not put on pasta.",

I had some Progresso Lemon Pepper Panko crumbs from a while back, and since they are VERY salty, I mixed them with Progresso's regular Italian bread crumbs and no parmesan.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as stated.  To my pasta I added a whole bunch of the Starter and a lot of parmesan.  This is a very easy very tasty meal.  The recipe didn't really use very much of the can of the Starter, so I'll have to see how it freezes for another meal another time.  Thanks, Progresso, for a wonderful meal!",

Before coating the chicken I added the garlic powder and tasted the coating--then added black pepper onion powder paprika AND parsley. Then coated and baked as normal. I realized after I had coated with the panko that I had forgotten the melted butter mixed in with the Progresso mixture. My chicken didn't crisp up so I had to put it under the broiler to prevent a soggy mess. The remaining soup for the sauce was WAY too bland to be used as sauce for pasta so I sauteed some onion and garlic cloves and once that soup was warm used my hand blender to mix it all together. The taste was still off--very much tasted like something from a box or a can even after increasing spices. It didn't do anything for the family--there was no 'wow' factor...the kids and hubby told me they honestly prefer oven 'fried' chicken fingers over this. I'm willing to agree--so much less work involved in those. I'm 90% certain we won't be having this again.",
