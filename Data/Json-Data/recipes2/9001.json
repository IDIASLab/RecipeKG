The addition of the diced tomato & salsa verde gave such a delicious flavor. Think a gooey grilled cheese & tomato sandwich with just a little tang to it. I did make a butter/panko/cheese topping per your Chef John recipe. I would think this would be a healthier version of mac 'n cheese since it uses less butter & milk. I will definitely make this again! (Note: I didn't have individual ramekins. I made it in a casserole dish baked 20 minutes @ 375 degrees. I did not place under the broiler as panko/cheese topping browned nicely in the oven.)",
