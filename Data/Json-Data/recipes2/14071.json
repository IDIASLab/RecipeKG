I knew that it was too much after mixing it together so I only used half to begin with. I ended up draining it all out and starting all over--this time leaving out the buttermilk because it makes it too \"runny\" and just using mayo. Also a half cup pasta is not nearly enough--try two to three cups uncooked. There is way too many onions and not nearly enough seasoning. I suggest adding some of your favorites. I added a little vinegar and dill weed. It looked so bland. I added shredded carrots for color. Tri-color pasta would be great too. Turned out good...after a lot of work.",

The salad looked kind of bland with just the cucumber and onion (I didn't use celery - personal preference.) So I added two diced roma tomatoes and a lot of fresh herbs - parsley chives and dill. I used celery salt instead of seed and that helped give it the extra seasoning that it needed to be really good. I'd say the recipe as written is a 3 but with the additions it's a 5.",
