I cooked the rice for 22 minutes, and it almost had solidified in the pot, but wasn\u2019t nearly cooked through or tender.  I added more water and ultimately more coconut milk, cooked another 10 minutes, and the rice still was \u201cal dente\u201d for lack of a better term. As important, it was totally lacking in flavor, not even a hint of coconut or onion.   Admittedly, I\u2019ve never had Burmese rice before, so I can't speak to what it should taste like.  Don\u2019t want to discourage others from trying,  since I\u2019m the first reviewer, but this just didn\u2019t work out for me, and it went down the disposal.",
