I used 2 qts beef broth 1qt vegetable broth as I didn t have ingredients on hand to start from scratch. I saut\u00e9ed the onion in a bit of oil and broth then added the spices until fragrant. I put the onion and spices in the crockpot then added the remaining broth. I put it on high for an hour then turned it on low overnight. In the morning I added the liquid seasonings and sugar and since we had a snow day returned the crockpot to high for an hour then back on low for the rest of the day. My add-ins were rice noodles jalape\u00f1os bean sprouts & cilantro. (Alas I forgot the basil - but it was totally yum anyway)",
