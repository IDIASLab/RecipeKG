The latter has a little stevia...PLUS a lot of what they term \"bulking agents.\" These are comprised of maltodextrin and dextrose. These are used to CUT the pure stevia for the purposes of saving the manufacturer money. However these 2 ingredients ALSO add sugars AND raise insulin levels. Pure Sweetleaf Stevia alone does not raise insulin. I find so many businesses today dishonest. They mislead the consumer without batting an eye. And speaking of eyes the consumers are so overehelmed by wide-spread lying in marketing and manufacturing they have simply resorted to turning a blind eye. I will try this recipe with Sweetleaf Stevia and a very small amount of real maple syrup or agave...which are more easily tolerated by the body. Agave raises insluin minimally and slowly...unlike sugar maltodextrin and dextrose. I will also substitute unsweetened carob chips for chocolate chips. Carob is naturally sweet. I will post my results tomorrow.",
