I over did the thyme a bit ( my fault I got over zealous with the spices I used fresh thyme and rosemary) but it was still phenomenal. I cooked the whole dinner in one big skillet. Cooked the pork chops (didn't use chicken) in the skillet put them aside cooked the veggies til soft then threw in the herb/spices for a few minutes then added the rice with the seasoning packet and the water covered for ten minutes added pork chops and peas then covered for another 15 minutes.....perfection in a pan!! Don't omit the cloves in fact all the spices work together for a wonderful combo and don't omit the squeeze of lemon at the end it adds a freshness and flavor thats delish. If your'e not used to using these herbs give this a try it will make a believer out of you.",

I didn't have the pork so I tossed in some bacon (it's just cured pork) for the flavor. I used dried onion and herbs instead of fresh and we skipped the jalapeno and chile at end. I used boneless chicken and sprinkled it with some Season All before cooking it. I only used a pinch of clove since DH doesn't like it and I forgot to squeeze the lemon over. Thanks I'll fix this again.",
