I didn't change the recipe a bit and it was excellent. No changes needed! All I did was keep the dressing the peas/jicama/water chestnuts and the nuts separate so that I could make it for lunch all week long. I also made the dressing for another salad. I added the pea/jicama/water chestnuts and cashews to a spinach edamame carrot salad and it was just as delicious. You can overdress the salad since the soy sauce is strong but if done right it is a definite crowd pleaser. Yummmmmmmmmm. Thank you for posting!!!",
