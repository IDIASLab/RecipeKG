We had this for breakfast on toasted mini cinnamon raisin bagels and my husband said \"...this is as good or better than any cream cheese spread you've ever made for bagels.\" Haven't had Trader Joe's honey walnut cream cheese but this is made fresh and I doubt TJ's could compare more favorably to this version Totally easy to make and the honey and the walnuts share equally in making this awesome. Thanks for sharing Cute Brunettes.!",
