As a result, I reduced the yogurt by 1 heaping tablespoon so as not to create too saucy a salad.  This worked wonderfully.  In order to give 5 stars a recipe has to offer salty, sweet, fatty and crunchy elements.  There was no crunch, which can be easily resolved by adding celery or red onion.  Additionally, I reduced the hard boiled egg to 2 and I'm glad I did.  Anymore and it would have seemed more like egg/potato salad instead of potato salad with some egg.",

While both were good I Preferred the one without the relish (just my personal preference). We thought the addition of the pesto seasoning was a nice change from the usual. I will be making this one again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
