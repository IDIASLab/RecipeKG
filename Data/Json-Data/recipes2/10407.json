The technique of 'massaging' the kale is very important since it breaks it down, softens the texture, and makes it more palatable. Please take the time to remove the leaves from the stems. The stems are tough and very bitter. Use any kind of kale for this recipe.",

It didn't need it but it sure would have been that much better with it in there. The kale did not wilt as fast as I thought it would. I was expecting it to wilt like spinach but it held its form well so you could actually do this 30 minutes or so in advance prior to the rest of your meal getting done. I have never seen red kale in my area so I threw in some romaine hearts that I had on hand. The dressing is spicy alright but the smokiness works very nice in this. This is great and I cannot wait to try it again WITH the avocado this time.",
