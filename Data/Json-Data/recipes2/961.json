I followed this recipe exactly (except I used more liquid to cook the grits), and it was perfect!  I made this last night and my fiance has requested that I make it again tonight!  I love the mushrooms, the creamy texture and flavor the grits has, and the spicy flavor of the sauce.  I used hot smoked Italian sausage and Texas Pete for the hot sauce and unlike the previous user, the Worcestshire was perfect for me.  Thanks so much for sharing this fabulous recipe!",

I ve only made grits a few times so I was a bit surprised that the recipe called for 48oz of broth so I compared that to the directions on the package of grits and decided to go with the package. I used 40 ounces and cooked the grits covered for 30 minutes. The grits were still pretty runny so I cooked them for about 10 more minutes uncovered knowing that I was going to be adding another 1 cup of liquid. Once I added the other liquid I had to cook for another 50 minutes to get the grits to a good consistency. Even with the additional cooking time I found them still pretty runny so I added about a cup of the cheese to the grits to thicken them up. I made the shrimp as directed (except with bacon drippings instead of Canola) and I found the Worcestershire Sauce to be too overpowering. I didn t feel the taste was worth the effort but my husband wasn t around while I was cooking so just based on taste he rated this a five.",

They eventually turned out really well but my brother who is from the south had a totally different method that is much faster and would have gotten the same results as we got spending over an hour at the stove. We also had to add way more cheese to get them thick enough to stand up like they should. For the sauce part I added red and green peppers cooked some finely diced bacon instead of using the canola oil and used Andouille sausage to give it more of a southern kick. I think the original recipe would have been good but not nearly as southern at least for the part of the south my brother is from. My kids wouldn't even try it but that's okay more leftovers for us it was that good.",
