I made this trying it with almond milk and cashew milk, both options heart healthy with no saturated fats. Coconut milk contains saturated fat. \n\nI added the spices (turmeric, ginger and cinnamon) to the 1 cup cashew or almond milk in a 2 cup Pyrex measuring cup (room to whisk without spilling) and microwaved for 1 min. 30 sec. The spices easily whisk  in when milk is hot, no need for a saucepan or mmersion blender, but you could.  I added 1.5 oz of espresso. My husband could not taste enough coffee at 1 oz and our machine pours a 1.5 oz shot. Then added 1 teaspoon of Truvia to sweeten. \nFinally, stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. The extract has an alcohol base making it evaporate easily. If you add it to either saucepan method or microwave method, you will loose some of the vanilla while heating. Stirring it in at the end keeps more vanilla in your beverage. \n*I used unsweetened vanilla cashew and unsweetened vanilla almond milk when subbing out coconut milk.  They are both good, I think I preferred the cashew milk as it is creamier than almond. Both are good choices. \nThis a great heart healthy, anti inflammatory drink! \nThanks you for sharing it!",

I use milk instead of cream to make it keto friendly, I make it all in my mug to make it 'lazy' friendly. First I put the vanilla and spices in the mug, then I fill the mug about a third with boiling water and let it sit and stir for about a minute . Then I add about a third of a mug of my cold brew, stevia to taste, and fill the mug up with raw milk cream. Than I add ice if it's hot out, or if it's cold I stick it in the mic for a few seconds. Delicious! Oh and I also add 1/4 tsp. cardamom with the spices. It's a little grainy with all the powdered spices, but that can't really be helped. It tastes so good!",

I used the same amounts per serving, so for a 30oz cold brew it was five times all the spices directly into the 25g of ground coffee, let sit 12-24hrs. We then just chill it in the fridge, post brew, and add half and half to taste. This is Delicious!! I was looking for a way to incorporate turmeric into our daily routine, to reduce inflammation, so we've tried turmeric milk (pretty good so long as you filter it well enough that it's not powdery), and chocolate turmeric milk. I like both of those - but THIS is our go-to now. Oh, so, good!",
