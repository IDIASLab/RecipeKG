I don't know if it's because the liquid in the 398ml can of diced tomatoes I used was more pulpy than watery or if I cooked it down longer than I should have after adding the cream. Either way next time I will stop adding pasta when it has the consistency I like. I don't use angel hair pasta often but I don't know why because it's so delicate and I loved the texture. To make a pretty presentation I transferred the mixture to a platter before topping with the cheese and then placed it in the oven to let it melt. Next time I might double the cheese because the bites that were heavy on the cheese were my favourites!",
