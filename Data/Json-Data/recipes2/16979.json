I made some garlic butter using 1/4 cup of butter, 1 tsp granulated garlic, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tbls parmesan cheese, dash of salt and pepper and 1 tsp oregano.  I mixed this together and spread it over the sandwiches before I grilled them.  They came out perfect!  I will definitley be making these again.  Thanks NYCDAVE for a very simple but tasty recipe.",

I take the easy way out and make on stovetop. I melt butter in a large skillet and spinkle in garlic powder onion powder and oregano. I then add 3 slices of bread sprinkle cheese on each slice and add top slices of bread. After the bottom seared I flip. Also I use a mixture of whatever shredded cheeses I have on hand: Italian swiss mozzarella and/or parmesan. If you need more sandwiches than your skillet will hold wipe out skillet and add another round of butter and seasonings; otherwise second round will taste burnt. I omit the marinara as my boys said 'doesn't need it'. Next time I will try with olive oil instead of butter to reduce the 'bad' fat content. Thanks for a new twist on an old favorite!",

Be sure to use whole milk mozzarella for the best taste!!!",
