I have been pining for 9 years for the soup I fell in love with while studying abroad in Cambridge England so I was so shocked and happy to find a broccoli & stilton soup recipe here. When I started making it I was worried that I had built it up too much in my head and I didn't want to be disappointed. I WASN'T! This is a great recipe. I made it exactly as stated but I think maybe the potatoes I used were a little big because it came out a bit thick. I just added another cup of broth and it was awesome. I served it with french bread and butter. Simple and perfect! This recipe didn't even need extra salt & pepper.",

Adding a whole red bell pepper (makes it a little sweeter and more colorful) and a tablespoon finely chopped garlic with the veggies and the red pepper flakes will give it that extra bite. I have also been known to add an ounce or two more stilton than the original recipe calls for. I even substituted vege broth for the chicken broth and made it for my vegetarian friends though you have to add a bit of salt and pepper to make up for the difference. Overall a great recipe and a great soup!",
