I won't even eat a salad where they have once been (even picked out the flavor never leaves) But I do like pickels so I planted four cucumber plants in my garden. By harvest I was giving cucumbers away by the five gallon bucket full so I had to find something else to do with them. I was going to have a party so I looked up cucumber recipes to see if I could offload smoe that way. I made the lemonade and tried a sip. I told my husband it was different from anything I had ever tried and proceeded to continue preps for the party. I was surprised when I picked up my glass to discover in the process of preping I had drunk it all and now I love it. BTW it was a hit at the party too. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!",
