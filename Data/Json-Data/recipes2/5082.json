By roasting my veggies, I bought a slight sweetness to the toppings to nicely balance the bite of the pesto sauce.  Sauteed some Baby Portobello mushrooms in EVOO.  To assemble the pizza, I used a pre-baked whole wheat pizza crust and then added the following in this order - pesto sauce, baby spinach, tomatoes, jalapenos, shallots, mushrooms, feta cheese, and freshly shredded smoked mozzarella cheese.  Wooooooo, Buddy!  This was the absolute best pizza I've ever made.  It was an \"Out of This World Meal\" which earned me the prized and golden Stamp of Approval (SOA) from Mi Gato Loco.",
