However I increased servings to 10 and followed the revised amounts. but the amount of fennel shallot apple and gorganzola in the recipe would've filled two 6 lb loins. I had ton of filling left over. also cooking time needs to be closer to an hour or at least 55 minutes. I cooked for 45 minutes and still had a little too much pink for some eaters. I was fine with it. I'd probably make it again.",
