The night before Thanksgiving I decided to make it for the FIRST time, my husband's entire family was coming over.  The turkey got rave reviews and everyone wanted to know how I did it.  Thank you so much for the recipe.\nI do have to warn people of one thing.  I did not read the recipe thoroughly enough and ended up at two different grocery stores the night before Thanksgiving (not fun) looking for WHITE WINE WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE because I didn't see the \"white wine\" part beforehand.  I had never heard of it and discovered that it is the Lea & Perrins that is made for chicken (it says \"blended with white wine and herbs\").  Learn something new every day!  Can't wait to use it on some chicken soon!\nOh, the only change I made to the recipe was to use half oil, half melted butter.",

Use gloves (my hands smelt like this rub for like a week not that its a bad thing or anything). and make sure to use a smaller blender/food processor. I tried putting it in a normal blender and there wasn't enough mix to get up over the blades. But the recipe itself came out AWESOME! Everyone loved it.",

In addition i put 4 tbs of butter under the skin of the turkey breasts and i used my baster to shoot the extra marinade under the skin. I also used poultry seasoning salt and pepper to season the bird in addition to the herb rub. It was fabulous. Really juicy and tender. Great rub!",

It got RAVE reviews!!!! the only thing I did differently was I eyeballed the amount of rosemary thyme garlic and onion. I made it about an hour before I put it on the turkey as well. I think it made the flavors mix well! And I also read it wrong. I put in 1/4C white wine and about a tablespoon of worceteshire (sp??). It still turned out fantastic!!! Juicy and flavorful. Sadly I didn't make a gravy out of the drippings but I will next year!! DEFINATELY going to be used again and again!!!!!!!",
