I didn't have time to marinate for 8 hours (poor planning on my part) but even with only 30 mins this was bursting with flavor! Aside from marinating time I made this exactly as written. This didn't make very much marinade - there was no extra for me to drain from the meat before cooking which was fine. A nice touch with the added basil! I added a sprinkle of crushed red pepper at the end for a bit of color.",
