So this became an \"assemble your own\" party.\nI made everything separately.  I grilled the chicken breasts and basted them with a garlic infused EVOO rather than BBQ sauce.  (I put the BBQ sauce on the table as part of the assemble your own.)  I cut up green and red peppers and a vidalia onion and grilled them while cooking the chicken. The other addition was that I offered flour tortillas as well as sub rolls. When it was time to eat I had a huge platter set out with all the ingredients and let everyone make their own.  It was a big hit.  \n\nSome observations. No one used the avocado. Almost everyone agreed that they would forgo the BBQ sauce. People were happiest with just the ranch dressing or in several cases, mayo.  The grilled onions and peppers went great with this sandwich. And lastly, most people preferred the tortillas over the rolls. It gave the sandwich a much lighter taste.  I will definitely make this again. If you do it this way, beware it is a LOT of prep work but once it was done I could enjoy my party along with everyone else instead of being stuck in the kitchen.  Thanks Dan.",

Or why some people come on here and change the recipe so much that they've actually posted a new recipe? I made this sandwich for my slim and trim family one Saturday for lunch and we LOVED it! Then we went out and shopped for the week \u2018til we dropped - in other words, we efficiently used up the calories. Still, I get so annoyed when I read reviews that complain about the ingredients being to fatty or high in calories. I want to read constructive reviews. I also get annoyed when these same people recreate the entire recipe. Why give a low rating if you don\u2019t even know what the recipe tastes like? AND, if you made the recipe wrong why give it a low rating based on your mistakes? Can\u2019t people just enjoy reading the recipes for what they are? And, if they make the recipe, then judge it on how it tastes. We ALL know how to lighten up foods and what we should and shouldn\u2019t eat. Come on people, let\u2019s be fair and judge a recipe for what it\u2019s worth, and don\u2019t redesign the entire thing - otherwise, post your own version of the recipe and see how YOU get criticized.",

I also mashed the avocado because I can then spread it on the bread for avocado in every bite, but that is not really a problem with this recipe... it's a very minor change!  The combo of all the flavors is really good!  The only change I made was to use a nice, crusty sourdough roll instead of the soft hoagie... and that really made it stellar!

I chose to grill the chicken instead of baking and basted it with a bit of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce which made it moist and juicy. I cooked the bacon separate toasted some kaiser rolls and added some fresh crisp lettuce and sliced tomato. The warmth from the grilled chicken melted the cheese and we didn't bother putting anything in the oven. These were perfect with some kettle cooked chips! Easy and very filling!",
