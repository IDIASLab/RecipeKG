Today it was a great choice for making use of a bunch of fruits before I leave town again in the morning. I don't like the nuts in this particular salad so I don't include them. I sweeten and flavor the whipping cream with powdered sugar and vanilla. Really any fruits can be used but today I used bananas grapes cantaloupe strawberries and pineapple. I could eat bowlfuls of this stuff when I was a little girl and wish I still could now!",
