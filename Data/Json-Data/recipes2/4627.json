I used ghee (clarified butter) instead of butter. The amount of coconut flavor is determined by the brand of coconut milk and by the type of coconut flakes. I used dried unsweetened and I believe grated fresh would have been much better. I will probably make this again. Thanks for posting the recipe.",

This was not a flaw in the recipe just in my inexperience with cooking with coconut oil.  I didn't use coconut milk for dipping, I used egg instead cause I didn't have any on hand.  I also added panko bread crumbs to the coconut coating.  It came out delicious.  I added shredded coconut to my rice for a perfect addition to this meal!  Thank you for a great recipe!",

I soaked the chicken in 2% milk because it was also what i had on hand. A lot of reviews said the coconut didnt stick so I dipped it in flour before the egg wash (i added a tbs of spicey brown mustard to the egg and mixed it well). Its important to let anything 'breaded' to set. I baked the chicken on a wire rack for 30 mins at 375. Served with shredded brussel sprouts. Yum!! I know that adding the flour isnt paleo but we dont eat that way so it was no bother to us i assume you could use almond or coconut flour for the same effect.",
