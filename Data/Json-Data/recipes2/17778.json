You do have to be very gentle with your banana slices or you will end up with mush -- but it will still be tasty mush!",

Adding pineapple would boost the tropical flavor and sweetness in my opinion and make it a completely 5 star recipe. The trick with cooking these bananas is to be as gentle as possible. Place them in the butter and wait don't stir them around. After several minutes (5 or so) then use a spatula to gently flip them. Minimal movement will help them hold their shape if that's what you're hoping for. My daughter did LOVE it! Thanks for sharing your recipe!",
