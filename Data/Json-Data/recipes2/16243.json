I can see why it's called what it is called because it's a tad too basic...there is absolutely no seasonings or spices in this thing to jazz it up. I knew just by looking at the recipe that I'd have to put more in it for it to work for us. It looked promising though so I thought I'd give it a shot. Recipe doesn't say but I have to assume it wants you to cook up the meat and veggies first then put it in the casserole so that's what I did. I misread it though and thought the potatoes were to go on top. About halfway through cooking the veggies on the stovetop I realized my mistake and added half the potatoes. I decided to keep the rest for a topping. So after mixing up the meat and veggies I put them in the casserole topped with spaghetti sauce (what I had) topped with potatoes then topped with garlic sea salt paper and more sauce. Then I baked for 75 minutes total then turned off the oven and took off the cover to brown the potatoes. My other changes: added Italian seasoning carmelized onions and garlic with the veggies and meat. It turned out pretty basic still but made for a warm hearty lunch on a cold winter day. Thanks for the recipe!",
