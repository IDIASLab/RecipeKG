I used my KA and didn't get stiff peaks to form but once I added the sweetened condensed milk everything firmed up. I was very pleased with the results. I debated over the cinnamon because I'm not a huge cinnamon fan. I'm so glad I put it in it gave a subtle flavor. This is very creamy. It is a tad rich but that just meant it lasted longer in my house since we didn't fill the need to eat an entire bowl. I can't wait to make this again and try different mix-ins like chocolate chips oreos and brownie bites! Will definately make many more times as everyone in my house are icecream eaters no matter the time of year.",
