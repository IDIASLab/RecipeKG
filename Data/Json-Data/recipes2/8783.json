I cooked mine for a 10 minutes because it the tuna was not hot at the reccomended time. I also mixed some cheese in with the tuna mixutre as well as sprinkling with cheddar and mozz on top. I also added fresh tomato on top as well as pepper. This was not something to eat with your hands. You will need a fork if you make only one serving. 3 stars for the way written and 4 stars with my changes.",
