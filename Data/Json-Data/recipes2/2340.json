They're slightly denser than regular pancakes, but I actually like that. The only substitution I made was to use ground flax meal in place of the wheat bran. I also got 10 pancakes out of this, using a 1/4 cup measure to pour the batter onto the griddle. I would definitely make these again--and may even add a bit of cinnamon just for a touch of spice. Great recipe, thank you!",
