I made four servings which called for 1 and a half cups of orzo. The dish would have been better balanced with one cup. I am soon to be 65 years old and orzo is new to me. I knew what it was but never used. One afternoon shopping in the pasta section a young man was looking for orzo. I asked him what he used it for. He said for pilaf..used instead of vermicelli.. Been hooked ever since!",

I added a chicken thigh (cooked in the butter fist with salt pepper and garlic powder) small dice with the hot sausages. I also cooked 1 cup of pasta with 2 cups of broth for just two of us with left overs. So good! Lost of wiggle room with this recipe to use any meat and herbs.",
