It is an easy recipe to prepare. I whipped the whipping cream for 3 minutes and then folded in the sweetened condensed milk and the 1 1/4 cups of Funfetti cake mix poured the mixture into a loaf pan inserted pan inside a ziplock freezer bag and froze for 24 hours. It scooped up and served nicely. My chief complaint is I did not like the taste of eating overly sweet cake mix batter. If I make it again I will make some modifications on the ingredients especially the amount of the cake mix.",

I used a regular yellow cake mix and added some Christmas colored sprinkles as that's what I had on hand. I also added some cake chunks (had those in the freezer from a previous \"project\"). This stuff is awesome! Can't wait to try with some different flavored cake mixes. I have a \"cinnamon bun\" flavored mix that I bought recently...the flavor sounded so good...didn't know what I was going to do with it at the time but now I know...and that flavor is next! Thanks Emygrant for a fabulous recipe. I won't be buying those premium brands any more.",

I do want to play around with this more to see what I can come up with b/c I love the idea of it and it was super simple to make. Thanks for sharing.:)",
