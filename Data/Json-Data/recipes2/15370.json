I just rolled the balls in bread crumbs at first but when I fried the first one it didn't do well. The sauerkraut sort of unraveled around the outside of the ball and tried to burn. I just dipped them in the egg/milk mixture and then back into the bread crumbs. They came out perfectly. They just seem to need the egg to hold them together well for frying. But an excellent recipe. It's easy to make and is a real crowd pleaser. This recipe is one I will reach for over and over again. Many thanks!",

I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt because I do not cook with salt when it is in other ingredients. I used a little more sauerkraut as my family loves it. The trick to these is the size too big or too small they will fall apart. I made them all meatball sized and none of them fell apart. I also dredge them in the flour liquid and bread crumbs and let them settle and create the \"shell\" before frying. If you like sausage and sauerkraut you will not be disappointed.",

I used my homemade sauerkraut chopped finely in a processor and was a little bit short of the 2 c. (probably @ 1.5 c. before chopping) so not a heavy kraut flavor; great for my BF as he doesn't even LIKE kraut and had no idea it was in them until I told. I have never understood the flour egg crumb steps but my friend it works so well on anything I have ever breaded and deep fried I don't question it. The only thing I really changed was to use garlic cloves sauteed with the pork mixture (as I felt it had enough salt in the pork) and half cream cheese and half mozzarella (which I had INTENDED to be Swiss.) I will try these again with 1/2 cream and 1/2 Swiss. They held their shape frying but crumbled when cutting so perhaps an egg added into the pork mix? Or be less impatient and make them 1\" bite size per instructions! (My deep fryer is really tiny.)Also baking would be healthier but I really liked the extra crisp crunch.",
