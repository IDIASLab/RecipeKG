I've decided to share this, since not many others have submitted a Paleo-friendly crepe recipe. I strive to inspire, especially now that Valentine's Day is up here soon. Treat your lover with breakfast in bed with these amazing dessert-like crepes! Add Nutella&reg;, bananas, or anything you want to your heart's content! These are super easy and healthier than the conventional crepe. Great for those that are looking for more fiber and in a Paleo diet.",
