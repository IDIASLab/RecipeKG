I didn t have sausage on hand but did have bacon which was a wonderful swap. I also substituted the syrup with honey because it was all I had on hand. This recipe is very forgiving and versatile. You could add cranberries for a Christmas side or add in other types of squash. Acorn squash would be delicious with this glaze and some chopped apples! This recipe is a wonderful base for all things fall.",
