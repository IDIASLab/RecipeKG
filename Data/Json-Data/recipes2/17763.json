Now I just usually make plain cornbread, may throw in the can of chiles or maybe not.  There are plenty of other things going on so to me the extras in the cornbread are not essential.  \nTips:  Mix up your dressing in advance, add the beans and allow the mixture to meld for a couple of hours in the fridge.  It seems to make the dish more flavorful.  If you're going to the trouble to  put this together, make the dressing as stated! Bottled ranch---noooo!  It's too wet and just does not have the creamier texture and tang you'll get by using sour cream.  Cut the cornbread into tiny cubes before removing it from the pan.  Makes for a better for presentation and it holds up longer.  Once layered, this still needs more than 2 hours in order to reach max flavor---more like 6-8 or overnight, covered, in the fridge. Yummy!",
