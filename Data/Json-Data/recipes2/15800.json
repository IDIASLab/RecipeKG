But the first bite I took I thought to myself. \"Uhhhh Christmas Bolognese?\" I think that it should be 1 1/2 tsp of dried basil and a pinch of nutmeg. I would also suggest using a cheese grater to shred the carrot. Also the recipe needs to be more specific about what type of ham you should use. It says slices so I guess bacon maybe? No I wouldn't use american bacon for a classic italian pasta sauce. I would used thinly sliced cured italian ham more commonly referred to as prosciutto. I give only two stars because they need to tweak the proportions of the recipe and be more specific as to how much and what kind of ham to use.",

I used 8 carrots a total of 9 oz of tomato paste 1 medium to large sized white onion 0.8 lbs of ham and 2 lbs of ground buffalo. Also as recommended in other reviews I used 1-1/2 tbs of dried basil and a dash or two of nutmeg. I sliced the onions carrots and ham and sauteed them in the butter until the carrots were soft. I then added the broth tomato paste lemon spices. I browned the ground buffalo in a separate pan. I then took all the contents in the carrot/onion/ham pan and blended them in the blender. I put the blended contents back into the pan and added the ground meat with its juices. I prefer the only texture to be the ground meat and everything else to be a puree. At the very end I added about 2 tbs of cream. I'm not a big fan of heavy tomato based sauces as the tomatoes are too acidic for me and give me reflux. So this was an excellent alternative. If you do like more tomato flavor you can always increase the tomato paste even more!",
