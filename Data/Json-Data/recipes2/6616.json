It took me literally 5 minutes to throw everything in my food processor & top my hot pasta. I personally loved the strong garlic & lemon zest. Next time I will use less fresh parsley the flavor was a 'tiny' bit strong for me but I prefer a stronger basil taste in pesto. The cayenne didn't make this too spicy in my opinion. However it DID bring out another level of flavor that my husband especially LOVED.. I will continue to make this recipe in my dinner rotation. I served this on top homemade pasta (I used the recipe \"basic pasta\" & the spaghetti attachment on my kitchen aid mixer) & garlicky saut\u00e9ed shrimp.",

I'm so glad I did, because it was delicious and pecans are considerably less expensive than the traditional pine nuts. I always have a huge basil plant and make pesto often, I think this is my new go-to recipe. The addition of cayenne gave it an extra depth of flavor and the whole recipe comes together so quickly that you can whip this up in a matter of mintes. I used mine to make a caprese style chicken breast over couscous. I will definitely make this one again.",
