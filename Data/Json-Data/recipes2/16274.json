                "reviewBody": "I tried this recipe for our Sunday dinner on Memorial Day weekend. It was served up as an appetizer and went over fairly well although was over-shadowed by a better appetizer. I followed the recipe fairly closely in terms of ingredients as the only change I made was to use fresh tarragon. The lemon zest was the largest flavor component a surprise the recipe but a very nice addition. I made a couple changes in the preparation. Due to time I heated up the goat cheese and cream cheese mixture from refrigerator temp by placing it in a pre-heating oven for a few minutes (the recipe calls for room temperature cheeses). Also I was hesitant to fold the artichokes into the cheese mixture so I individually rolled the 1/2 hearts into the mix then through the parmasean and parsley. Overall the lemon zest is a nice idea but this appetizer lacked luster. To add luster I would have used artichoke hearts marinated in a vinegar packing rather than water. However I think the hearts would them compete too much with the zest.",
