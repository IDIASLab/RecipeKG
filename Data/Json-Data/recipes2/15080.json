However we use a 9x13 casserole dish and enough hard boiled eggs to cover both layers of asparagus/cream of mushroom/shredded cheese. We also use Durkee fried onions instead of crackers. The top layer of fried onion is not put on until the last five minutes of cook time so they come out crunchy but not burned. The whole family loves this casserole!",
