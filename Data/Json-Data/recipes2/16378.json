I'm not a big fan of either so when I found this recipe I thought it sounded delicious. I used an icecream scoop to put semi-frozen cool whip scoops on top instead of peakes. I put the pie in the freezer until it was ready to serve so the cool whip would keep its shape. I definately recommend this recipe because it's not too much work for a great looking and tasting dish!",

And be sure to get the big box of pudding! I don't care for the fruit or nuts either. So overall I made a banana chocolate cream pie of some sort...
