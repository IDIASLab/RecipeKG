I did zest the lemons and added to the batter. The cake batter was VERY thick and I thought barely enough to spread into a 13x9 pan so I used a pan that was a little smaller. Of course what this meant was that the topping would be deeper and just may require a bit more cooking time. I checked at 27 minutes and the center was still very jiggly so I put back into the oven checking every 3 minutes. It was starting to get very brown around the edges so I took it out at 35 minutes. Even with the addition of the lemon zest I think this was lacking lemon flavor. This is ridiculously easy to make and that s definitely a positive. Although these were OK I still prefer the traditional bright yellow lemon bars with the filling that s similar to a lemon curd.",
