I mixed both packets together to make a rub. I rubbed half of the mixed packets all over the meat, added black pepper, one onion, a little (about 1/3 cup) water to the bottom of the pan and sprinkled a tablespoon of butter cut in small bits on top. I covered it with foil and cooked it for 4 hours in a 300 degree oven. I served it like a roast with buttery mashed potatoes and fresh string beans from our garden. It was tender, tasty and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Again, really easy to make. This has been added to my recipe box and I will definitely make this again. Thank you Allrecipes.com.",
