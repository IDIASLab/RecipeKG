Also, there's no problem with rinsing the pasta- it will help cool the noodles down faster so you can eat the salad right away if you want, and I've never had a problem with mayo not sticking to rinsed noodles.  That all being said, this pasta salad is very yummy and easy.  You can add anything you want to it, like tuna, olives, grapes, chicken, little tomatoes, cucumber... and it always turns out good!  Low fat mayo works well also.",

I used whole wheat rotella pasta and I added 1 pound of homemade bacon bits (cut 1 lb of bacon up and fry it into bits) and used a can of drained sweet peas and a few dashes of some vidalia onion vinaigrette. Make sure the onions are chopped very very small. It's great hot or cold and just the ticket when someone asks you to bring a side dish to a party.",

I added 1/2 a pound of bacon per another user's suggestion and used a lot less onion as my onion was very strong and I didn't want it to overpower. I also added some red pepper flakes some cajun spices and salt and pepper. Turned out great especially for being a last minute recipe and using what I had on hand. I'll make it again!:)",
