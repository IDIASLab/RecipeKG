Next time I am going to try chocolate and then I am going to try not mixing the PB in completely so you can have a taste of the white chocolate as well as PB not completely mixed. The wait time is just on the settling of the mixture to harden up. Its not a solid fudge it is soft but not so soft it squeezes in your hands so keep it in the fridge when not being eaten.
