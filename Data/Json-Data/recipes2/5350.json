I used the full amount, and I'm so happy I did--so delicious, so nuanced, and worth every single calorie!  Because of the reduction, you catch just a bit of wine flavor, but it is definitely a plus, not overpowering, at all.  IMHO, this is a company dish.   My only change was to use bone-in chops, because that is what I had.  Thanks for the tip about judging the thickness of the sauce.",

The flavors are mild and cozy perfect for a comfort dinner. Have some crusty bread to clean up the plate! YUM!!",
