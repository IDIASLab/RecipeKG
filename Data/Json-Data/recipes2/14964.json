DO NOT throw out the whites you can whisk it and then add it to the sauce it makes if lighter. I didn't add parmesan to sauce either I put it on top with a bit of nutmeg. I have to say I will use less pasta next time and more tomatoes this was dry and it needs more herbs as well. Neither my husband were really fussy on this and we both love greek food. Maybe with a few changes this might be a 5 star in our house.",
