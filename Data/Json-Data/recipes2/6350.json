To save time, I used Trader Joe's bruschetta in a jar--LOVE that stuff--in place of the diced tomatoes--awesome flavor as it includes tomatoes, onion and some garlic. I also used goat cheese instead of blue, as another reviewer mentioned.\nThe next day, as I had bought more mushroom caps than I needed for my dinner party, I baked using the same format and did the following:\nsauteed spinach on the botton, Costco veggie burger on top of that, then the mushroom cap as prepared above on top of the burger--perfection!! Trader Joe's also has a veggie burger (their Masala burger) that would work really well w/ the mushroom incorporated w/ it.",
