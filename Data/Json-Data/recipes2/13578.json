To cut down on this, I added brown sugar to the butter/apple mixture and let that simmer in there to sweeten it up a little. Also, I sauted the pork in olive oil and garlic, without butteryflying them. It just made the recipe that much easier, and tastier.",

My only suggestion is that instead of using this to stuff into a butterflied pork chop use smaller chops and just use this as a topping. In my opinion there was just a little too much pork. Also if you do not like gorgonzola cheese or bleu cheese then this is not the recipe for you. If you do then MAKE THIS! Thanks for a wonderfully simple dish that is perfect for family or company! This one's a keeper!",

I put the pork chops back in on top of the apples and steamed them for about 10 more minutes. When I took the pork chops out I just sprinkled a bit of bleu cheese inside and stuffed a bit off the apples on top of it then smothered the chops with the remainder of the apples and onions.
