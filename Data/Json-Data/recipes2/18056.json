I used about 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup lite mayo. Used cream of mushroom soup instead and frozen french cut green beans. I browned the chicken with garlic salt and pepper until almost completely cooked through. Also added 1/2 cup or so of shredded monterrey jack into the soup mixture. Served it with angel hair pasta. We thought this was great comfort food, will definitely make again!",

Delicious served over angel hair pasta!!!  Will add to my favorites! I would like to add that if you have picky eaters, combine the soup, mayo and garlic, cheese and mix....brown the chicken and cook until almost cooked...then place chicken in dish and cover with soup mixture...then serve green beans (personal favorite for this diah if made this way) on the side. I find that even picky eaters will try it this way and end up saying...I think I would like this with the beans in it too!",
