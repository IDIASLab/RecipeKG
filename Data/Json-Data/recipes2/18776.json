I was born and raised in Charleston, and come from a family of local cooks and this is truly authentic and what the locals recognize as shrimp and grits. The gravy is deeply flavorful, and the shrimp is just done, not overcooked.  You can add a tad of heavy cream towards the end if you want an even more velvety texture in the grits.  This is the real deal and as a born and raised Charleston, I say excellently done.",
