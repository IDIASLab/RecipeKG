                "reviewBody": "The dip itself was good. I made this in the slow cooker so I could take it to work and share with my friends. I cooked it on low for about 2 hours before it was ready. There is a sweet undertone to the dip even with the use of mayo (not salad dressing) so this may turn some people off. Most tasters enjoyed the flavor. They said it had just the right amount of spiciness and it wasn't bland. I would recommend adding more chicken than the recipe calls for perhaps 2 cups as the texture was a little runny. Pairs well with Wheat Thins melba toast crusty bread or carrots and celery. Pretzels might be nice too! The kick was perfect - right between spicy and not-too-spicy. For those who aren't huge fans of buffalo sauce while the buffalo flavor was there the dip did not have an in-your-face buffalo sauce taste.",

My regular oven wasn't working so I cut up chicken sauteed in pan chopped and did the chicken that way. Used convection oven to heat dip.
