I would recommend quadrupling it if you are planning for 6-8 people and/or leftovers. Also start light on the oil and then add more if needed; mine turned out a little oily. Also if you don't like really salty dishes I would start light with the olives and then add for flavor as needed. I put fewer in than the recipe noted but didn't taste it until I had too many and was a bit too salty. Finally I had never cooked with crushed pepper and a little goes a LONG way. If you are feeding this to kids definitely hold the crushed pepper. Also sprinkle a little then taste -- and repeat if necessary otherwise you will be surprised! Overall -- great recipe with very fresh ingredients.:)",

Sorry Giuseppe but I used a good brand of canned diced tomatoes and the sauce turned out beautifully! Will try it with fresh tomatoes as soon as we get some this season in our area (southern Ohio valley). This recipe is restaurant quality and one of the very best pasta sauces I have ever tried! Had the peccorino romano cheese on hand and it definitely finished the sauce. I sauteed some chicken tenders in extra-virgin olive oil and added them last minute to the sauce; over linguine al dente it was heavenly! Thanks for a keeper",
