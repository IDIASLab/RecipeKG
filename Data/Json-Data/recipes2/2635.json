I used flax meal to make up for the protein in the egg (a vegan trick) and substituted orange juice for milk. The result was pancakes bursting with citrus flavor. It's a new favorite in our house! Serve with butter and/or maple syrup.",

I am not much of the vegan way to eat things but I do enjoy flax seed and all the combination was very good with pure maple syrup. The orange taste is very light but gives it a nice touch. Will definitely make again if I fall into the OJ surplus again. Thanks",
