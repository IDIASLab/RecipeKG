I do suggest a couple changes though.\r\n\r\n*I added Shredded Cheddar Cheese to the mixture when I mixed all the ingrediants on the stove, as well as some of my own extra spices.  It gives it that extra little hint of flavor and it was really yummy!\r\n\r\n*Also, the recipe calls for 10 3/4oz of milk, I added 10 oz (which is a cup) and it was just a little runny.  I think I would only add 3/4 a cup next time.\r\n\r\nI will make it again though!  It was fast, easy and a tummy pleaser! :) Thanks Andrew & Amy!",

I put the meat down in the pan mixed all the stuff together all but the tots put that over the hambuger them I put the tots on cooked covered for 50 min at 350 them I put 2 cups cheese on top and cooked until the cheese was melted....Turned out beautiful. My husband will ask for it 3 times a month and he don't like casseroles. My kids are the same way...Try this way and you will like it more. Rememebr to season the meat how you like I use allpine touch and all purpose seasoning salt and garlic.",
