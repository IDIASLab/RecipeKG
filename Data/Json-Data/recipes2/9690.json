My kids help me make them, especially if I let them eat a couple while they're still warm! We make them several times during the holidays and throughout the year, and they usually bring in quite a bit of money in our student ministry's dessert auction at church!",

I'd say mine were 1 1/2 \" & made 40-44. Secondly it takes a lot longer than the time given to finish these! HINT: Use a heaping regular teaspoon & another teaspoon to aid in scooping out the warm mixture. Scoop from the sides 1st. Scoop a few at a time onto wax paper to cool enough to shape. To add a bit of color after rolling in confectioner's sugar I dipped the tops in melted butter then colored sugar.",
