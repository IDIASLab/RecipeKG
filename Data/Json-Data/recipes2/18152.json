One very important step in working with eggplant is to sprinkle the cut sides lightly with salt, cover with a clean tea towel and weight it with a large bowl or pot in a colander over a dish, for about 30 minutes. This will \"weep\" out any bitterness in the eggplant. No need to add salt, of course, if you \"weep\" it this way. My DH, who had never had eggplant before -- being rural Saskatchewan, produce not grown in local gardens is just starting to come into the stores -- loved it, asked for seconds, and has already requested that I place a special order with our produce manager, if that's what it takes to make sure we get in eggplant as often as it is available.",
