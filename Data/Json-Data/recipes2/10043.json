Evidently the cream cheese amps up the richness of this drink and compensates for all the almond milk versus so little coffee. I used coffee ice cubes to keep the ice from diluting my coffee as I slowly sipped it and I used my normal stevia as sweetener. The key here might be very strong coffee to begin with. I made this again tonight with decaf coffee and drank it hot. I like it hot as well as cold!",
