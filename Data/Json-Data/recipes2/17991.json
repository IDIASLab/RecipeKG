He's one of those who dips his french fries into mayo and I thought this would give a nice kick. First I seeded the Chipotles (as called for) but when he said it could use more heat I added a bit more and left the seeds in. Results - wicked hot really flavorful and this stuff now resides in my 'frig ALL the time. Thanks for posting it.",
