I did/added the following with mine--\n\n-I cut the potatoes first and then boiled them for a shorter time (12 min).\n-I substituted one cup of mayo with 1 cup sour cream.\n-I tossed it with 4oz of coarsely grated mild cheddar cheese.\n-I added 4 chopped hard-boiled eggs.\n\nI just wanted this salad to be out of this world and it was!

I disagree with an earlier review that it's better the next day...I actually liked it immediately after I put it all together because the bacon was still crunchy.  I think next time I will keep everything separate in the refrigerator until serving time, then throw together.  I prepared this one day ahead of time and while it was still very good, it lost the cruch of the bacon...which I really liked.  Great recipe!  I will make this again and again!",

First, out of curiosity, I weighed the amount of bacon called for in the recipe.  Whoa.  Lots of bacon \u2013 too much for me!   I think I used half that.   Also, as I\u2019ve never been a fan of straight mayonnaise in this type of salad, I cut it with sour cream.  I thought it needed some contrast in texture, so, as the expression goes, I added some celery \u201cfor a little crunch.\u201d  As for the dressing, I found it a little weak.  Since I made just a third of the recipe to begin with, I gratefully had some of the dressing mix left over, so I added more, along with some fresh ground pepper, dill weed and garlic powder.  Finally, since I knew the salad would absorb some of the dressing as it chilled, I added some half and half to compensate.  A fair amount of tweaking, I admit, but it elevated this from a wimpy three to a four star potato salad.",
