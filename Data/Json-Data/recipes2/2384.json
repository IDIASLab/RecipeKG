You can make it even easier -use chunky salsa of your choice in place of these three ingredients - can of tomatoes can of green chilis and chopped cilantro. We used low sodium cream of chicken soup and reduced fat cheese. The recipe makes a lot of 'sauce'... next time I may double the number of tortillas to make more enchiladas up the amount of chicken & veggies in the filling... and maybe even add black beans if the family agrees. I think with those additions the ratio of sauce to enchilad will be more to our preference. We had a salad with ours but next time I think I'll just shred lettuce and dice some tomatoes and serve on top of the entree for some freshness.",
