At first the kids (mostly 6 yr old.) turned their nose up at it until they saw my son eating it then they had to try it and loved it. I brought the cream cheese to room tempature and sifted the powdered sugar before adding it. I used a mixer and had no problems with lumping when I added the pumpkin.
