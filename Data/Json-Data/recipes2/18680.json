I didn't have time to put this in the oven so I put the butter & corn in a small pot until the corn thawed. Then I added the cream cheese chives and s&p to taste. We loved it! I think it would have been even better with fresh chives so I look forward to making it again but I'll stick to my stovetop version.",

I feared the onion salt would make the dish too salty so I used onion powder instead (and did not need to add any salt at all). I did feel that the ratio of cream cheese to corn was a bit much so I increased the amount of corn. That's just a personal preference though. Oh and I did use frozen vice canned corn. Again just a personal preference - didn't change the taste or consistency of the dish at all. Making this last night was a \"trial run\" since I hoped to be taking this to a Thanksgiving dinner. I was so pleased with the result that I will definitely be making this for Thanksgiving! Thanks so much for sharing your recipe PPERRY0501.",
