I gotta say that these turned out really good for being baked. I thought for sure that the onions would stay crunchy, the peppers would get mush, and the chicken would get overcooked but none of that happened. This was a good recipe and one I would definitely make again even if it wasn't raining.",

I feel 20 to 25 minutes would be a better baking time as the vegetables were overcooked at 30 minutes. Fast and easy dinner with a little tweaking. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #LetsTacoAboutIt",

But putting it on the stove prior to baking in the oven caused it to cook through and therefore I had to cut the time, and cover the meat mixture before baking which didn't allow the vegetables to get as cooked as I would have liked.  I cooked the chicken in an iron skillet so that may have caused the meat to cook too quickly. I guess I can skip the skillet next time.",
