I don't pour my soup/milk mixture over the top when making a green bean casserole so doing it with this recipe just didn't seem right. After cutting my onions I completely mixed them with the liquid and then layered. I hope the three star ratings do not deter anyone from making this because with the additions of a few seasonings and using the chips it was absolutely delicious. A couple of modifications and you've got at least a four star recipe. Thanks for a good start!",

I love onions but as a complete side dish it seemed like it needed another flavor to balance it. Perhaps the potato chips would have done that. The soup mixture wasn't liquid enough to soak down through the layers and formed a hot layer of goo on top. I'm interested enough to try this approach again with some tweaks.",

(i had about 1 1/2cups chips) i sprinkled a generous amount of hot cayenne pepper, just before i put on the last layer of shredded cheese. it looked like too many onions for the casserole dish i used but when the onions cooked down it perfectly filled the dish. my daughter who will tolerate onions, but doesn't love them took the leftovers for lunch and she said it was better than the night before. we look forward to making this again. i think when i make it again i'll add some fresh rosemary",
