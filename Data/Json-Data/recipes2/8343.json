Follow the recipe only I double the ranch, add chicken stock but don\u2019t cover the chops completely. Cool on low for 6-8 hours. The longer you cook the softer they will be. We always add in peppers, onions, and whatever else you would like with it. Quick, Easy and tasty. Nice alternative vs running the oven.",

Instead of baking chops at 450 for 20 mins, which in my option dries out pork, I broiled on high for 5-8 mins per side (depending on thickness) until done.  I also added a spicy seasoning to the mix. *My personal rule is when cooking any type of pork, I add about a 1/2 inch or so of apple juice to the pan. The juice helps to keep the pork moist while cooking and the flavor pairs wonderfully!!",

I did make a change~ after seasoning the chop per the recipe, I dipped it in beaten egg, then coated them with Panko crumbs.  Baked in the oven per the recipe.  Hubby LOVED them!!  We will now be eating pork chops on a regular basis!  Next time, I will brine them first~ just like Thanksgiving turkey~ and resolve the worry about dryness.",
