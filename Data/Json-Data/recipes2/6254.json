I like roasted asparagus but don't feel it really worked well with this combination of ingredients. If I made this again I would probably flash cook the asparagus in boiling water to retain some of its crispiness and add brightness to the salad. I would also make some sort of lemon vinaigrette instead of the honey dressing. With all these changes it is essentially a different recipe so I will not be making this again.",
