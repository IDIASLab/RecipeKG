I didn't know if  poblano chiles were spicer than green chiles so I used pepper jack cheese instead of regular monterey jack to add some spice.  Also to make it a little lighter I used light evaporated milk and light sour cream.  It was DELICIOUS!

We ate it for dinner but my \"screwed-up\" version will now become a favorite for breakfast or brunch.  I'll be heating some up for breakfast tomorrow!  Next week I intend to try the original recipe with the exact ingredients.  Husband loved my version and can't wait to try the original.  PS - being in a hurry, I did use store-bought chicken (Louis Rich brand Southwestern seasoned Chicken Breast Strips) which I had never tried before.  Found it in the lunch meat aisle - great taste!",
