First of all I used two cans of diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning undrained instead of whole tomatoes and one can of diced tomatoes w/chilis. Then I used lots more garlic minced (four cloves - you can never have too much garlic!) Then I added a cup of frozen corn and some leftover brown rice (probably 1 1/2 cups cooked). Lastly I used some fresh chopped cilantro. I love rice in my soup expecially since it absorbs the flavor and makes it hardier.",
