Here is what I did: Line your sheet pan with parchment to avoid sticking. Brush both sides of the potato slice with oil and season with salt & pepper. Cook as directed. First brown your sausage in a skillet (I used spicy pork sausage so I omitted the chipotles). Drain sausage on paper towels & remove most of the grease from the skillet. To the skillet add one clove of minced garlic along with onion bell peppers and mushrooms. Saut\u00e9 until cooked to your liking. Tip cooked potato slices with sausage onion mixture and sprinkle with cheese. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro. This was a complete meal & definitely not just for breakfast!",
