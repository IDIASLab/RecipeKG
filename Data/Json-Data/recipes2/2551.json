You can make it days ahead of time and have it out of the oven in just a few minutes when you need it. Add more chipotle peppers if you like it spicier. This recipe makes a lot, but it actually freezes well. I usually freeze half of it and have it another time. If you're making it for a party, though, bring it all because it will be gone!",

Better late than never!  Thank you, AllRecipes!\n\nAnyway, I do a couple of things a little differently now which I thought I would share.  I now use a Colby Jack mixture of cheese instead of straight Monterey Jack.  They're less greasy that way (not that this is health food by any means!).  They unfortunately don't make the McCormick white and green minced onion blend anymore, but plain dried minced onions work just fine.  Make sure to use the minced and not the white/green onion powder blend!\n\nAnd I now like to use the scoop tortilla chips because the mixture won't run off the chip.  If not, try to find the thickest tortilla chip you can.  They hold up better that way.  Enjoy!",

Good call, because even with just half the amount it still  featured  too prominently for me.  I used fresh minced onion rather than dried and a 4-cheese Mexican blend rather than Monterey Jack.  Hubs and I agree that this intriguing array of ingredients that led me to this recipe in the first place unfortunately got a little lost by the cumin.  If I was to make these again,  I'd reduce the amount even further, if not eliminate it altogether.",

I  assembled these at home and brought them with me and because they cook so quickly they are ready in no time. I actually got 2 cookie trays full from the recipe, so it makes a lot. I used shredded colby/cheddar cheese and monteray jack. Not greasy in the least. It says to quarter the shrimp but I must have had larger shrimp so I just cut them into smaller pieces. The combo of spices are excellent and you can taste everything working together....The adobo peppers, cilantro, cumin, parsley, minced  onion with the cheese; and they look so great! Nice orange -color, green-speckled, cheesy mounded -over scoops with shrimp pieces peeking out.  Winner!",
