The juice will reduce in the frying pan to form a wonderful subtle-flavored sauce.  Don't use store-bought orange juice...when reduced it tastes much too strong, almost like marmalade, and will take away from the natural flavor of the fish.",

Used 3 clementines (only oranges I had) half lemon and quarter of a lime. Added fresh lemon basil (had no lemon pepper) with some cilantro to the juice before pouring it over the fish in the skillet. Added fresh garlic to the oil and a little lemon basil too prior to putting fish in it. Added ground peppercorns to fish in the pan. Great sauce can also use on tilapia. Will double the juice contents if using clementines again as I would've liked more of the sauce - used 2 fillets (approx 1lb).",
