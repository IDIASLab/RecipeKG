I made it as instructed, toasting the whole spices first and then grinding them with the turmeric. I strongly suggest you don't skip the toasting, it makes the spices so much more flavorful, and the aromas as you're making it are mouthwatering - you know this is going to be good!  I made a curry sauce with this powder by frying garlic, onion and ginger, then added the powder to \"toast\" it a bit in the wok. Then added coconut milk, salt and pepper, let it simmer for a bit, then the veggies: Potato, cauliflower, red bell pepper, corn and garbanzo beans. Deee-licious! If you want it spicier, add the hot pepper of choice, though I suggest habanero, since that's what is used in Jamaica.  I served alongside Jerk swordfish, hence the vegetarian version, but add any meat of your choice to the curry sauce.  I say again, Deee-licious.",

I do suggest using a spice grinder if you have one. I didn't add the cayenne to the mix as I figured I could add it to the final recipe later. Thank you Monty for sharing this recipe.",

I didn't think it would work without the usual Indian aromatics and the large amount of anise struck me as weird but it actually works! Be sure to add lots of habaneros to the final curry more than you would think. The curry mix is \"sweet\" and \"high toned\" so the heat absorbs well. When making the actual curry I also make sure to briefly fry the powder with browned onion (in addition to initially browning the whole spices when making the powder) which mellows the otherwise raw licorice flavor of the anise. It's not an all purpose curry powder (is there even such a thing?) but it makes a rocking coconut curry that has a definitive Caribbean taste quite different from the Indian variety of curries. Used the recipe many times and even wrote it down!!",
