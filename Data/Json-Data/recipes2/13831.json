The name was certainly interesting. I'd never baked an \"Earthquake Cake\" before but as it baked I understood the reason for the name. I had a little trouble with the frosting sticking to the pan but I just scraped it up with a spatula and spread it back onto the upturned cake. I did add some chopped toasted pecans that I had left from another recipe. I took this to work with me and had several requests for the recipe. This is a great recipe if you need something quick simple and tasty.",
