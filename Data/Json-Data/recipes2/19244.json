Instead I folded the ingredients together because I didn't want to lose any of the fluffiness. It turned out great that way. Also I didn't add much liquid (maybe a tablespoon) because I was afraid it would be too runny and mine turned out thick and creamy. Thanks for a frosting recipe that is something new and different.:) ( as a side-note the reviewer who suggested that maybe 3/4 cup was a typo and that one should use 3 to 4 cups of powdered sugar is incorrect. If you use that much sugar you will definitely get a grainy texture. I only used 1/2 cup and the texture was great).",

They are for a halloween party. thanks for a great recipe....also i added maybe another 1/4 cup powdered sugar to make it a little sweeter.",
