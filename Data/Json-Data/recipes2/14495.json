I mixed in the pickle relish and other ingredients in recipe. I did add about 1/3 C. diced pineapple (that was cooked on my ham) and added 1/2 an 8 oz container of whipped cream cheese. I also added minced grn onion and a few shakes of hot sauce. YUM! I don't recommend adding salt until you taste it. Let rest in fridge overnight & then, YUM - on crackers, rye bread, whatever...I love it with my few modifications! Idea/Edit: I only had about 1 C ground ham I needed to use or toss out. So, I mixed in liver sausage (about 1/4 C) and rest of ingredients with a few tweaks. Another yummy spread. Just giving ya'll ideas",

Grandma made this for the kids when we were little now I make this for mine. Best on saltines. This also is good using a pound of un sliced quality bologna.",

I had two thick slices of ham leftover from Thanksgiving (maybe 2/3 or 3/4 of a pound total) I omitted the onions I used more like 2 or 3 tablespoons of dill relish the teaspoon of mustard and maybe 1/3 cup of mayo as I don't care for Miracle Whip. I didn't measure anything just added it in. Oh and I don't have a food processor just one of those little mini-choppers. I chopped the ham up (took maybe five or six pulses) then put it in a bowl and added the other ingredients. It tasted great immediately after mixing I'm sure it'll be much better after sitting in the fridge awhile! A quick and great use for leftover ham. Thanks Pat.:)",
