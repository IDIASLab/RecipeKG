Placed faced down in a 13x9 for 30 minutes in the oven at 350. Let cook for at least 10 minutes, peeled off the skin, cut it up, and added it to the skillet and picked up where this receipe left off...  LOVE it! We made a gluten free vegan lasagna with it, and it was amazing. I enjoyed it as much or more than my traditional meaty tomato lasagna. Today, I'm using the rest on some gluten free egg fettucini noodles and we are all stoked! Thanks for such an EXCELLENT alternative to acidic tomato based sauces.",
