Instead of the chile sauce I used approximately 3 tablespoons of Sriracha Sauce, 4 cloves of minced garlic, 3 tablespoons of fresh ginger, red pepper flakes (to taste) and just about a 1/2 fresh squeezed lime. As for the veggies you can use whatever you have in your fridge. Before serving  squeeze the remaining lime, stir and add 3 chopped scallions. I also did not use the cilantro and peanuts because I did not have any; and used smooth peanut butter because that is what I had on hand.",
