Then I added Morton's Garlic Sea Salt due to the comments of adding the garlic. Plus it has some parsley in it for more flavor. I traded ground pepper for cracked pepper. Traded for fat free sour cream. I also used 1/3rd fat free cream cheese and traded the regular milk for fat free half and half. That is just my thing though because I believe it cooks better with a long cook time then milk. Due to my years as a barista. None of this messed with the flavor. Though this is the most amazing soup/potato soup that I have ever had! Hats off and Thank you for sharing!!!",

I added fresh chopped celery fresh parsley onion flakes onion salt a clove a garlic minced..and I used bacon fresh from the butcher that has more of the Smokey taste. I also did not fully cook the bacon so the fat would help with flavoring. It was awesome. Wish I would of doubled the recipe it was a hit for my family.",

This freezes well in ziplock bags too.",
