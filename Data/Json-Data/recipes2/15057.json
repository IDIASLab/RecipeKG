It is simple to make and it turned out moist -almost TOO moist therefore it was a bit heavy and I had to adjust the baking time -this is probably due to the fact that the cake mix I used already had pudding in the mix. I noticed many people noted the \"extras\" that they added. I think the part that puzzled people the most were the instructions -perhaps they didn't read them?- overall this would be a recipe that a young teen could make but it wouldn't be anything I personally would not make again -it didn't have that \"red velvet\" cake taste. It just pretty much seemed like a milk chocolate cake tinted red instead of a cake w/ more depth.",

This is a great recipe for if you are short on time and/or patience... I actually used 5oz. of non-instant chocolate pudding because that's all they had at the store (and I don't know how to count oz.) I did as a lot of other people did and used a cream cheese frosting recipe. 5 STAR! I will be making this recipe again and I think I will do as one reader suggested and try adding just a pinch of powdered sugar and a few drops of vanilla to this cake mix. Muncha! Muncha! Muncha!",
