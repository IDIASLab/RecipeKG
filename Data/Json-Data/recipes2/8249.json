I had some hash browns I needed to use up so I browned them a bit with some seasoning salt instead of using the potatoes. I only had 6 eggs instead of 8 and wouldn t hesitate to do that number again. I wanted to add red peppers in the sausage mixture with the onions to add more veggies. I also didn t have sour cream so I decided to add mayonnaise instead. This recipe didn t disappoint. I think it would have been delicious even without the changes I made and it shows how versatile the recipe is. This is going into my favourite breakfast casseroles even though we had it for supper.",
