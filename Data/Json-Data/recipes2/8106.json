It was very tender but not quite tender enough to shred so I took the pork out and sliced it like a regular pot roast. Did not do the crisping thing in the oven. And it turned out beautifully and to great acclaim. Used Fresca for the soda and used 50% more oregano and doubled the garlic. Added some garlic at the beginning and the rest an hour and a half before finishing cooking. Also made a roux and added the broth to it to make a gravy. Will make it the same way again - and often",
