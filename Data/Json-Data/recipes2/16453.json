I subbed a can of tomato puree for the tomatoes I didn't have and used a Texas white wine. Nice flavor to the sauce great budget meal too as it requires few ingredients. The bread crumbs made the filling a bit mealy and odd textured it didn't hold together at all even after standing 10 min after coming out of the oven. We didn't like it enough to make our favorites list but it was a nice meal. Thanks!",
