I love a good snack so I whipped up this dip. I allowed it to sit in the refrigerator overnight so the flavors had time to meld. Whoa nelly! I found my ramps left this dip with a very strong flavor. I would reduce the amount of ramps next time. After refrigeration this dip would shape nicely as a cheeseball as mentioned. If you want it spreadable leave it out at room temperature for about 1/2 hour.",
