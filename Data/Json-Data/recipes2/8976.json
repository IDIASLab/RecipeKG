I was dipping with crackers however so if you used something more absorbent like bread it's fabulous (or pour it over french fries - yum!) It was super easy which is always nice too. I used just the normal baby portobellos since that's what I usually keep in the fridge but it would be great to change it up especially when the more unique varieties of mushrooms are on sale. I did broil this for a bit after I baked it to get the cheese nice and brown on top. If I make this again I'm definitely going to find some crusty bread to soak up all the goodness!",
