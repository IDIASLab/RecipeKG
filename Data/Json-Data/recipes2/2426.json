I had to google it. After reading about them I decided to use a pie crust for this. It sounded about the same. I used a recipe for a 9-inch pie crust and used an 8-inch square pan. I also had to use smoked scammorza (like smoked mozzarella) cheese. I know hot dogs. This is a nice recipe and a fun and cleaner way to serve cheesy hot dogs to a group of kids.
