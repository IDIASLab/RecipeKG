Now after I looked it up and found this I gave it a try and bought tortilla and made this recipe with minimal revision (only added 1tbs of brown sugar and more red chili flakes to spice it up and 2tbs of Parmesan for texture). This was a bomb. I don't think I am eating diablo from next door anymore. This tasted exactly similar and even better. So I made double portion and saved/froze the rest as meal prep for next time . Thanks alot",

However, easing back on the red pepper flakes would probably make a big difference, so if you're not into spicy, reduce. I used white cooking wine as opposed to white drinking wine, and it worked just fine. Will DEFINITELY be making this again!",
