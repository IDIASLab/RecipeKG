I found the dressing as written to be too salty (even with lite soy sauce)like others have said. To fix this I added extra rice vinegar lime juice and a little olive oil and honey. I used it to dress shredded cabbage with raisins and it was a hit! I had to come back and update review. I ended up adding some fat free miracle whip and blended it up. It became a wonderfully creamy nutty flavorful dressing. But nothing like the original recipe though.",
