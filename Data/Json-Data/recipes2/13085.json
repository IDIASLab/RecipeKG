I really couldn\u2019t form patties as the mixture was not firm enough, so I just dropped large spoonfuls in the hot pan and patted them down with the back of the spoon. After the first side browned, I turned very carefully with a wide spatula, like turning a pancake. They firmed up fine and were easy to lift out of the pan and serve. They were excellent all by themselves, but would also make a good sandwich on toast or buns, would go well with tortilla chips or Fritos, and might be good with some dipping sauces. I will definitely make these again!",
