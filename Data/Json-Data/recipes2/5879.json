I've made it twice and the only thing that stayed the same was the tortellini and the shrimp (needed to get them out of the freezer)!  I didn't use pesto either time - the first time I shredded fresh basil and the second time I used dried.  Both times I sauted fresh veggies that needed used up - zucchini, red and yellow peppers, what was left in a jar of roasted red peppers, etc.  I added dried red pepper flakes for more flavor.  This has become a go-to dish at our house.  I might try it with chicken the next time . . .",

One last thing I couldn t find sun-dried tomatoes so I just got a large tomato and diced it. I ll try and tweak the recipe in the future and it made for a nice lunch before work.",
