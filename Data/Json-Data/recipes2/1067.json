It has a decent amount of protein, so I like to put a glass of milk in the freezer a little while before I workout, so it's all ready to make when I'm done. Also makes a great dessert! I like to use natural peanut butter and natural maple syrup. I highly recommend natural grade B maple syrup (it has more flavor than grade A, and natural maple syrup in general is way better than the processed kinds!)",
