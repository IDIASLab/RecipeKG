I actually mixed this recipe with the recipe that my mom uses flower I mixed cornstarch and hot water and port a little bit of it into the soup mix and then I took the drippings from the beef tips and marinated the potatoes in that. I used Frozen mixed vegetables and I put that directly into the soup slash broth mix. after I marinated the potatoes and the beef tip drippings I poured the potatoes and the beef tip drippings into the soup which helps make it thicker on top of the cornstarch mixture that I used in the broth and I also added a lot of water and then let it cook down. Actually turned out really great I'm going to also make beef Stromboli to go with it and I think I'll be good",
