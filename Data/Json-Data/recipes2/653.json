I love the smell in my house and also it made chopping it easier, it just falls apart. I have never cooked corned beef so I never dreamed I could make corned beef hash. The recipe is simple and tasty! Huge success. And it freezes well, this makes a lot for two people to eat so we froze most of it. We just take it out and put it in the fridge the night before then pop it in the microwave. Yumm! Great Recipe!",

My mom made it for us many years ago to use up roast beef (and probably lamb or other roasts) and I recall her grinding the cooked meat but I just chopped it up.  I used olive oil and regular onion as that was what I had.  I didn't have the proper salsa but served it with ketchup like my mom did.  Delish!!  It brought back good memories, too. Thank you for the recipe.  Next time I'll try it with the salsa.",
