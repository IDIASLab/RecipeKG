I couldn't get this to thicken much so I added more cheese and hoped it would work on pasta after boiling and noticing it was coating the spoon. It did work; although it seemed thin it worked well on the pasta and visitors (hubs' brother sister in law nieces and s-i-l's grandmother) all enjoyed it. I am not a fan of Alfredo but this was a nice enough version for me. I did add chicken to it; I sliced chicken strips cooked in olive oil and garlic put it in a separate bowl and added back in to the sauce once the sauce was done. very nice; thanks for the recipe!",

I use fat free cream cheese, and throw in a dollop of fat free sour cream, but I cut the butter to almost nil. Maybe two tablespoons. Fresh ground pepper, garlic powder, and sometimes the parmesan. Depending on the kind you use the combination of garlic and parmesan can be overpowering. We use it for many things and everyone loves it! Our favorite is to make tortellini, fry and slice italian sausage, steam some spinach and artichoke hearts, top it all with the sauce.",
