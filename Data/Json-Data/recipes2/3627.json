I added more soy, plus some olive oil and sesame seed oil just to get the hard as a rock mixture to dissolve.  We all missed sauce--there was no sauce over the spaghetti, which could be considered a crime in my house.  I say, personally--quadruple (or more) the sauce, follow directions and just before adding the noodles, dump the marinade into the fry pan, cook for a few minutes, THEN toss your spaghetti.  Voil\u00e0...sauce.  I made this on Sunday, bagged everything and finished it on Monday without issue--great for a make ahead and finish off meal!  Thanks!",

I also added a little of almost every Asian sauce including hoisin and oyster and I simmered it somewhere between five to ten minutes. The result was pretty thick with enough sauce that I made extra noodles to mix in. But it tasted pretty good! It's a good recipe in that you can use whatever vegetables you like and change the sauce up too depending on what consistency you prefer.",

I only added 1-1/2 TBSP of corn starch after reading the reviews. Once the chicken was no longer pink I removed it and kept it warm. After the veggies were soft I added about 8 oz of chicken broth plus 1-1/2 TBSP corn starch to some cold broth. I stirred it until smooth and then threw it in when I added the chicken and noodles back in which made a nice sauce that wasn't too thick. I took the chicken out when it was no longer pink and held it out until the veggies were soft. I used Lo Mein noodles from the store. They were ok but not as good as what I get when ordering out. I'll try spaghetti next time. My whole family liked this. My son is the pickiest and he ate it. I'll save this one and use it again.",
