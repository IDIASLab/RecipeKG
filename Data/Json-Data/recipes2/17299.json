I was looking forward to taking home the leftover but the hostess gave me back my clean bowl. When asked for the recipe, I don't bother writing it down for them. I simply say, \"Allrecipe.com\" and they know what to do. I made the recipe as is, minus the walnuts (nut restriction) and marshmallows (wanted the salad to be less like a dessert). Everyone wanted to know what was  the crunch in the salad and were excited to know about the toffee bits. Used pineapple tidbits, instead of crushed. I added the mandarins oranges as late in the mixing as possible to minimize crushing. NOTE: Drain fruits very well to avoid soupy salad. I am now looking for the next occasion to make this again and try to whip my own heavy cream instead of CoolWhip.",
