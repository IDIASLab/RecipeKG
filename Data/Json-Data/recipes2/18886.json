I am puzzled by the indication that this recipe yields 6 servings. Dividing the risotto mixture into 6 produces croquettes about 3-1/2\"  diam. each, which is about the size of a softball, and that's before inserting the cheese! Dividing the risotto into 36 instead, produced croquettes about 1-3/4\"  diam., and were the right size for inserting 3/4\" cubes of cheese. Once filled with the cheese, each croquette is about 2\" diam. Final note...only 2/3 cup of bread crumbs was required to coat all 36 arancini croquettes. I enjoyed these, but am only giving this 4 stars because two in my family aren't big fans of Parmesan (necessary, because it's the \"glue\" that holds the risotto together). Hope these notes are helpful.",

I used the risotto cold out of the fridge and I think because of that I didn't even need to add anything (egg or breadcrumbs) to the rice when forming the balls. They held together beautifully.
