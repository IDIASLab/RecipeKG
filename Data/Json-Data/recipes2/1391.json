I think the next time I would just use my garlic press rather than roasting the garlic and so cut down the amount of garlic in it. I might try just using a little more of the Classico Alfredo sauce rather than the milk too. Be sure that you are generous with the panko and butter on the top---you need to judge that by the size of the surface of the dish you are using. I would definitely make this again! Thanks Arich01!",
