The recipe would be even cheaper if you used real potatoes and mashed them yourself.  Also the type of cabbage used can make it taste differently.  We often used \"green\" cabbage (spring cabbage) or Savoy cabbage.  Also, if you saute the cabbage in a bit of butter in a pan, it tastes less strong.  I would also recommend putting butter and warm milk in the mashed potatoe.",
