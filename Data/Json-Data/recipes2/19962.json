I did not want to star rate my recipe because I feel that would be unfair, however I want to clear up some modifications that were made to the recipe.  I actually only use about half a cup of green onion and about 1 and 1/2 cups of petite peas.  Italian parsley is best to use when making this (also know as broad leaf parsley.)  I add the peas to the pasta in the last 2 minutes of cooking and rinse both to cool before mixing it together.  Also, I've found that ranch dressing works best (especially when mixed with 1 cup mayonaise and 1 cup low-fat buttermilk.)  The dressing has a better chance of staying creamy when buttermilk is used.  And with the portions listed, I would use about a half cup more of dressing and serve the recipe to about 8.  Thanks for the reviews everyone.  I have more recipes on the way!",

What a wonderfully refreshing and simple dish! Made it in 15 minutes (chopped the veggies and mixed the dressing while the noodles boiled). I used rotele noodles diced a half a cucumber half a red bell pepper and half a carrot. Minced 2 cloves garlic and coarsley chopped a quarter of an onion (the onion flavor did not overpower the dish). Dressing was 3/4 C mayo 3/4 C sour cream 1/4 C milk and 1 packet dry Italian dressing mix. That's it! I completely forgot to put salami or pepperoni but the meat was not missed even by my extremely carnivorous boyfriend. Now even my vegetarian friends can enjoy the fantastic salad! I believe any combo of veggies will work wonderfully. Just use what's on hand. THANKS CAROL:)",
