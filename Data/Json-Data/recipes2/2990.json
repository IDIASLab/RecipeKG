When I blended with my immersion blender it made the creamer nice and frothy. I ended up with some beautiful latte foam. I don't drink coffee but I made a lovely chai tea latte. Also the creamer does separate in the fridge so I store it in a mason jar and give it a quick shake before pouring into my tea. Thanks for this gem of a recipe!",

I have also made this using 50 grams of marzipan and 2 cups of coconut milk and it's pretty yummy instead of 1 cup almond milk and 1 cup coconut milk. I left out the added sugar in this case.  I've also used hazelnut milk instead of almond and it's delicious too.  Also, in my original recipe the vanilla should be added at the end, not heated as it can make the vanilla taste a bit bitter.  Thanks, hope you like it.  Update:  add 1/2 tsp of lecithin granules during the mixing process for a creamier texture.",
