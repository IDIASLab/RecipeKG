I wasn\u2019t crazy about the idea of pouring this over ice anyway.  So I blended the fruits as called for,  using twice as many (frozen) raspberries, mainly just to use them up, a handful of ice and some milk to make the blender go.  Knowing Hubs would prefer this, I skipped the mint in the mix, using it just for garnish.  This worked well and tasted good too \u2013 only problem was that it needed some sweetness, so I mixed in Splenda to taste.  Hubs loved it.  I don\u2019t drink smoothies myself, I just make them, so the final review is his \u2013 pleasantly sweet, filling, great, balanced blend of flavors and, surprisingly, he didn\u2019t miss the typical yogurt-based smoothie.  (Please note that this recipe calls for a juice machine, not a blender!  The blender will not move without added liquid!)",

I keep a bag of frozen wild blueberries and pineapple chunks in my freezer all the time.  I also freeze bananas that are starting to be overripe. I leave out the mint due to personal preference.  No need to pour over ice.  The more frozen fruits you use, the thicker it will become.  I use the same ingredients as the recipe, minus the mint.  In my magic bullet  My favorite is to use - one orange, a banana, berries, couple chunks of pineapple, and Activia if I'm in the mood.  It is such a versatile recipe.  I just keep putting fruit in until it is full.  One orange makes enough liquid for it.  Yummy",

When you 'juice' you get a very rapid and easily digestible 'shot' of vitamins and minerals more quickly into your system because the fiber in fruit and veggies doesn't have to be digested (which takes much longer to travel through your system and get into your bloodstream.) That said whether juicing or making a smoothie this is an excellent recipe but experiment with any and all fruits and veggies. Try 'juicing' kale apples and a lemon for a super energy boost.",
