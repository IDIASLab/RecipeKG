I guess I was hoping for something with a Gyro flavor and that was totally lacking. I think it would have been better if the red onion had been left un-grilled like an Gyro is but maybe that would have overpowered the fish too much. I do LOVE the Reynolds Foil method of grilling the fish and use it ALL the time for my pescetarian daughter. When the rest of us are having meat on the grill she gets fish cooked in non-stick Reynolds Foil. Thank you Reynolds for introducing us to this quick easy method for grilling fish!",
