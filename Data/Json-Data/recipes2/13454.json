My grandmother always made potato pancakes at least once each week but used a tiny bit of flour on outside and then were served with sour cream or applesauce. Funnily enough I just finished dinner and logged in to find this recipe. A friend just cooked something similar but he used ground pork and seasoned with salt pepper cumin italian seasoning and a little tomato paste. Once pork was cooked he used leftover mashed placed a good portion in hands and put pork in middle. Formed into a 2 inch ball dipped in beaten egg and then in breadcrumbs and fried. Delish.",
