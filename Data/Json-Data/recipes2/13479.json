I didn't have any white sugar left, so I used brown instead, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It turned out beautifully, and drove me crazy with the wonderful aroma while it baked. I managed to control myself, wrapped it in foil when it had cooled, and allowed it to sit overnight. I had a piece the next morning with a cup of coffee and couldn't believe how delicious it was! You definitely do need to let it sit overnight though. It was difficult to cut even then as it was so moist and tender! Use a serrated knife for the best outcome. The next day, it was easier to cut, but it is quite a delicate cake even though it is fairly dense at the same time. \n\nI will be making this a LOT! And I'm sure it would be a great recipe to change up a bit, too, like using blueberries and almonds, or apricots and walnuts, but I must say the rhubarb is so delicious, I'll be sticking to the original recipe for the most part.\n\nLove it love it love it, and thanks for sharing!",
