With grilling season approaching this is a great addition to my list bbq ideas. I am not much a red meat eater and even I went back for seconds. My husband a dedicated red meat eater was thrilled. and even my children 2 and 5 loved it. Next time I may try adding a clove of crushed garlic...just because I love garlic. Definately a repeater.

We thought about not using the marinade for the sauce since the steaks had a nice flavor from marinating but we are very glad we took the time to make the accompanying sauce. We didn't notice a steak sauce flavor to the sauce at all. We could mainly taste the wine and the stout (we used Guinness Stout and a red Zinfadel for the wine) but it was a pleasant taste...not overpowering. Thanks for the excellent recipe! It's definitely a keeper!",
