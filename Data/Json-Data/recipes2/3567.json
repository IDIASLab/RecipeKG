Also the presentation is sort of strange. Everything is pink that's for sure. And since the chicken is cut up into pieces I actually couldn't tell the difference between the chicken and the mushrooms on my plate. Next time I make this (and I will make it again for sure) I'll leave the chicken breasts whole and saute the chicken mushrooms and onions with the spices before adding the beets and maybe skip the juice. Overall tasty recipe! Four stars for creativeness and taste three stars for presentation.",
