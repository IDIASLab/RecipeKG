I used whole oats instead of quick oats (it was all I had) & whole flax seed & the muffin was very good. Next time I will add some sliced apples or dried cherries.

I used 1/4 cup of Egg Beaters in place of the egg, omitted the walnuts, and used 1 packet of Splenda instead of the honey.  The original recipe was 13 Smart Points.  My version was 4 Smart Points.  I can't wait to make this again tomorrow for breakfast :)",
