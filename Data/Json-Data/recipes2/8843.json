However it is definitely a solid base to build off. We really liked the dressing. I did have to alter it because my daughter is allergic to soy. The internet recommended substituting the soy sauce for balsamic vinegar and some salt which worked well. Next time I will definitely experiment with added items such as apple goat cheese nuts berries (craisins etc.). My husband who hates kale did not like this salad but that was no surprise.",
