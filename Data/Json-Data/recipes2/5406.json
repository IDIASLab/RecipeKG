Then the marshmallows were so soft even after being refrigerated they were very hard to handle to dip into the chocolate & graham crumbs. I was a chocolatier for 32 years so the chocolate was the easy part for me even tho my ganache remained too runny. I had to add more cream to thicken it up so I could pipe it. If you want to make these give yourself plenty of time and have patience. I would not make them again.",
