I added a tsp of Paula Deen's seasoning salt recipe to the flour (it is 1 cup salt 1/4 cup garlic powder 1/4 cup black pepper - keep it in a ziplock bag I use it all the time) which imparted more flavor to the chicken itself. I added a can of sliced mushrooms which complemented the chicken. I also cut back the dijon mustard to two spoonfuls which was plenty for my tastes. I found this to be pleasantly salty which comes from someone that hates anything to be too salty. If you're afraid everything will taste too salty I would limit the amount of parmesan cheese but do use some because it added an added something compared to other dijon cream sauce dishes I have prepared. The whole thing was very easy and used a lot of ingredients I usually have on hand.",
