I was very much impressed and so was the hubby. I did use chicken breast instead of the dark meat out of personal preference. The only other change I made was that I substituted pepperjack for the Monterey jack because I already had it on hand and knew we'd like that extra punch of heat.  I typically don't have much luck with melting cheese and fully expected some clumping but there wasn't any. The ingredient amounts and the directions are spot on.  You have changed my opinion on mac and cheese Matt R. and I thank you for that!",
