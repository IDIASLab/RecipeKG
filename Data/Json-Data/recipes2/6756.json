I added some imitation lobster meat I had in my freezer 4. I added extra Half-N-Half ( texture was very thick) Otherwise I followed the recipe as listed and it was delicious! I've never made homemade chowder before but thought It compared better than many chowders I have ordered in a restaurant! Great recipe!",

I used two cups of cooked lobster from our feast a few days ago (I had frozen it) A decadent meal served with garlic toast and salad. I will definitely make this again (if affordable)",
