I use the sweet red thai chili sauce in my version as well as fresh grated ginger (not dried ground).  Also, it's really an integral step, is to let everything sit refrigerated for a couple of hours before eating - this is really an important step that you won't regret.  I wanted to mention that one review indicated that tamari is actually just soy sauce and I want to clarify.  Although tamari is a type of soy, it is not the same as regular old soy sauce.  The tamari adds a much deeper, richer, more authentic flavor to the noodles.\nThe only other thing worth mentioning is that I toast my sesame seeds - I love them this way!  Happy eating!",

Also, the recipe reads 1/2 (8oz) package of spaghetti - I think it should read just 8oz of spaghetti.  But otherwise a really great recipe!!!",
