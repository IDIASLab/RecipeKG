To make it fast and easy, I used rotisserie chicken breast that I had cubed up the day before.  This was great texturally; creamy avocado, crunchy walnuts, chewy dried fruit, meaty chicken.  This had great flavor as well; savory and a bit sweet at the same time, wonderful freshness from the basil and a hint of tartness from the lime juice.  What are you waiting for?  Go make this now!  :)",

I also cooked the diced chicken in a tablespoon of olive oil minced garlic salt and pepper mainly because it doesn't say how to. The changes didn't add to the calories or fat content because they were all vegetables. This is a great recipe. Easy quick and great for lunch leftovers! Definitely a keeper.",
