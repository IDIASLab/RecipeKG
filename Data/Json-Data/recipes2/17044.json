I followed the recipe exactly (used low fat sour cream and the generic store brand ranch mix) and the longer I let it sit the better it got. Right after I made it I wasn't that impressed with the taste (tasted pretty much like ranch dip) but I just tried it again five hours later and the flavors are really improving! I can really taste the jalapeno and the cilantro now. I love spicy food and would say the heat is about a 3 on a scale of 1-10. Next time I will use fresh garlic instead of powdered. Definitely make this a day ahead of time to get the best flavor.",

The ranch seasoning was WAY overpowering. I think next time I will use half a packet of the seasoning use a habenaro for a kick. I also had to add about 3 tablespoons of flour because it was way too ruiny for cracker toppings. I loved the cool flabvor of the cilantro followed by the zing of the pepper. If you are looking for a spicy dip this isn't for you. Unless you add a few other peppers to give it the kick you are expecting.",

I omitted the garlic powder (even though I love garlic I just wanted to cilantro and pepper flavor to shine). I used one habanero pepper (those things are spicy) and it gave it some amazing kick. We used this sauce to top our southern style eggs benedict (cornbread roasted pork fried egg). UNBELIEVABLE!!!",
