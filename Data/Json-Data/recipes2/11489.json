The one problem I had was that there was not enough sauce. It was thick to begin with so refrigerating it for 20 minutes didn't change the consistency of it. I thought it would melt/run down as it baked but it all stayed on top of the bun which made these a little dry. I recommend doubling the butter/sauce. Overall a good recipe and one that would go over well at a party.",

I just placed the rolls on a foil lined baking sheet didn t grease it. Also I used the presliced sandwich pickles instead of hamburger dills. They came out pretty good. I was worried they would be soggy but they weren t. I will definitely make again maybe add more cheese?? Great quick meal with leftovers for the weekend!",
