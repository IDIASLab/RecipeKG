I also added a little Brazilian rum and 1/2 oz of simple sugar. It was a big hit! Thanks for the base recipe.",

My mango tastes a little odd but I guess that's bc I bought some jarred mango in syrup--what you buy in the refrigerated produce section--and have never had it before. fresh mango is definitely better. But it worked to try it. I agree with Sunny--the lime is very strong so I'd cut that down. I actually didn't use any ice bc I only have my food processor and I've been told not to use ice in it. I suppose I'll have to get a blender one of these days and try it again. It was good even without the ice. thanks for the recipe!",

To me this tastes almost like plain orange juice if you were to buy a brand that has added sugar (like Donald Duck brand which I used to love as a kid lol). I did reduce the lime by half so the lime was not overpowering. However the mango flavor still didn't come through. I tasted my mango before I pureed so I know I had a good one with flavor! This recipe is too much effort for what amounts to sweetened orange juice. I have one mango left; gonna try a smoothie instead. After I tasted the finished recipe I added more ice thinking that would help. It didn't but I decided to freeze the whole thing so I'll have a kind of granita or gelato or whatever it's called. Not a total waste but I definitely won't make it again.",
