As with all recipes it's fun to tweak them adding your own twist and this was no different. As others mentioned I used a sugar free Cheesecake pudding mix made per instructions and then folded in most of the whipped topping saving just a bit for dollops on the top. But I also took some mixed frozen berries and pureed them pouring some on top of each layer and drizzling on the top for a pretty finish. I think the berry sauce added a lot to the fresh fruit flavor. Thanks for a great base recipe - it was a big hit at a neighborhood BBQ.",
