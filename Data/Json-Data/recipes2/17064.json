                "reviewBody": "Okay..this is going to sound soo not my norm review. But I honestly didn't get this. And meaning by this the directions. I bought 2-9in oblong angel food cake rather them making them and the serving size is a throw-off. The directions really really threw me because it says cut in half width-wise and I took that at cutting straight down the middle at the 4 1/2 inch mark standing it up and hollowing out the center which to me make 2 huge portions and not 16. Not getting how each portion makes 8 if it's stood up like that. I'm hoping that it should have been cut horizonally down the center in half and scooped out that way. Because the 1st one I had stuff everywhere and the filling didn't leave room for the pie filling and barely took a quarter of a can. The 2nd one which I assume was correctly done still had more then half the pudding mix and was just left going hmm?? with questions. It should be so simple but wasn't and I didn't understand what bits I'd be filling a hole with the cake being soo small. Unless I was suppose to use a 9 inch ROUND angel food cake...then that would make better since. So recipe clarifications should be in order on this. Sorry my cake was 9 inch oblong not round. And assuming this indeed..not ever store has available 9in bundt style cakes available. My apologies if my review isn't correct. But wording is always a key factor when trying to make others recipes to the T.",
