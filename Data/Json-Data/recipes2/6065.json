Of course I am careful to cook pork all the way--raw pork isn't good. Anyway I've forgotten how much I prefer sausage burgers to hamburgers and I really like the combo of flavors in this--the spices in the pork and the toppings. Very delicious! I halved the recipe and got 7 burgers out of the deal. Now I'm told I make small burgers but I still think that the recipe as written would make more than six. Thanks for the recipe!",

Although I didn't have the sherry so I replaced it with teriyaki and I also added a tbsp of brown sugar and 1 tsp of crushed red pepper. The pork I had was also from a wild farrel hog which usually taste gamie but the flavors hid the wild taste. I will use this recipe for the rest of my life when it comes to making pork burgers...

I did half the recipe and did make a couple of deletions and additions. Besides halfing all of the ingredients I added a shot of Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce and a dab of hot Chinese mustard to the meat mix. I found the mix pretty wet but formable so I skipped the breadcrumb and egg. I let the patties set up in the fridge for a good three hours before grilling. I used sweet and sour sauce with a little sweet chili sauce and a squirt of hot chili sauce heated in the micro to top. Yummy! Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.",
