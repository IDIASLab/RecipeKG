This is a GREAT vegetarian dish (unless you don't do dairy) and you could easily add some steak or chicken to these to bulk them up. Very light and a rather \"guilt free\" dish as well. I made these with one minor change I used Light Balsamic dressing with EVOO vs. the Balsamic and Olive oil seperate. I made them for a 4th of July party about 3 hours ahead of time and they turned out great (next day not near as good)! I didn't make my own peppers (they were costly fresh) but the jarred were great. I do recommend having toothpicks on hand though helps keep them together.",
