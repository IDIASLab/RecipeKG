I think you could also make it with plain yogurt and get the same wonderful results.  I had a lot of baked potatoes in the fridge, so I used those rather than raw potatoes and subbed spinach for the kale, because I had it on hand.  This soup was so good and filling on a very cold, snowy, and blowing Indiana winter night.  We enjoyed 'Pickle-Juice Bread-Machine Bread' from AR with this soup.",
