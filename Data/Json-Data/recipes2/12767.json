And I used coconut milk instead of buttermilk, which isn't easy to find around here no matter the season. Grating frozen butter was not easy in this heat, I had to be really quick so the pieces wouldn't melt in my hand, and I ended up bruising my fingers badly. The results were totally worth it, though. My whole family loved it. Will try again when winter comes, this time with actual sweet potatoes.",
