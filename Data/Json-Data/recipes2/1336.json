If you don't have a double boiler to melt your chocolate chop the chocolate into small even chunks then melt in the microwave at 40-50% power stirring every 30 seconds or so til melted. This should only take a couple minutes tops. I did find the dough difficult to work with and roll into balls. It was very sticky. It's best to roll all the balls first (or whatever amount fits on your pan - in my case it was 16) then roll them all in the powdered sugar. Don't go back and forth between rolling into balls and rolling in sugar. This gets very messy. I baked mine for exactly 9 minutes and they were perfectly done. A nice light minty flavor; not at all overpowering. The recipe only made 55 cookies for me and I made sure they were about 1\" balls (about 7-8 grams each).",

I didn't have unsweetened chocolate, but I had unsweetened cocoa powder so I followed the guide on the cocoa to mix with oil as a chocolate replacement.  I thought the chocolate flavor came out just right!  These baked up to have a slightly crispy edge with a soft, puffy middle. Will make again and increase the mint.",
