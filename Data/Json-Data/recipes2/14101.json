I did saute the legs in the shell but I did not add the corn & I think it needs a lot more Old Bay than called for. I love the idea of the shells being cut open prior to serving...much easier to eat. Next time I will make up extra sauce to use for dipping. I also want to try it w/ some BBQ seasoning & see if I can't duplicate Joe's BBQ crab legs.",

Also we both agree we're glad we made only a small portion of the butter seasoned with the red pepper and Old Bay - it was ok but nothing beats good ol' traditional drawn butter.",
