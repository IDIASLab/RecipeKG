This one was surprisingly easy to do although I would like to improve my technique so that I have a round pizza roll instead of oval. I used Johnsonville Hot Italian Sausage and a Pillsbury refrigerated pizza crust. Both were perfect for this dish. When I cut the roll it appeared to be too bready but when I tasted it there was plenty of meat flavor that came through. While I am a die-hard Reynold's Wrap user this was my first time to use the no-stick wrap. It held true to its name with nothing sticking and made clean up quite easy.",
