With the shells I would cook them for atleast 10 min instead of eight. They weren't all the way done and after baking they were hard on the edges. Also I wasn't too big of a fan of the tomato puree. Not too much flavor. I think next time I will just use ragu or prego sauce of my choice for extra flavor. Overall this recipe was pretty good!",

I made a few changes of my own which I felt made the recipe that much better. We're not big fans of bacon so I substituted the bacon for 3 Italian sausages. I removed the skin of them and chopped the meat up. Same cooking time and everything...just different meat. I found that using the sausage helped yield more shells as well. I also added a bit of shredded cheddar cheese on top since we're all such big cheese lovers. But this recipes is DEFINITELY one I will be making again real soon!!!",

May be one of those things you notice more when it's missing rather than when it's there. And this only filled I think about 2/3 the shells called for & that was not even stuffing them really good.
