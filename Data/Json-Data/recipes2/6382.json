Because my can of chipotles in adobo sauce was ALL chipotles there wasn't a way for me to add abodo sauce...I could have picked out 2 chipotles but I questioned whether that was the recipe? Instead I used two whole cans - 2 chipotle in adobo sauce cans.... Considering the overpowering hear this is probably NOT what you meant! What size cans? Or is there a certain brand you recommend? Sure this is good if done right. Will try with just 2 chipotles...but it's that adobe sauce that we love....",
