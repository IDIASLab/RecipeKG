Where they do vary is in the amounts of the ingredients, less or more fat, less or more powdered sugar, and so on. This recipe has those measurements nailed on all counts, and I particularly liked the combination of shortening and butter. (I happen to be in Naples now where it is Africa hot, so I needed the sturdier holding power of the shortening) I stuck to the measurements precisely, but fiddled with the flavoring slightly - a half teaspoon each of vanilla, almond extract and butter flavor and just a pinch of salt. There aren't too many buttercream frostings I like well enough to eat directly from the decorating bag (once finished with it of course) like this one!",
