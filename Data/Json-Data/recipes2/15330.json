I doubled (at least) the chili powder added some cumin black pepper and garlic salt to the dressing. My biggest recommendation is to use very fresh very ripe tomatoes for the best flavor. Also might even be better to cube the mozzarella cheese instead of shredding it. The shreds just sort of blended in I was hoping for a stonger cheese flavor. Overall great pasta salad...even better the second day!",
