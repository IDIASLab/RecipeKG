While I was grinding it out for the teaspoon measurement I thought it was a bit much but wanted to follow the recipe to give a real review. I would say to use about half to 1/4 of the pepper. Also what brings out the flavor in deviled eggs is salt definately add a little. The ranch dressing gave it a little tang but took away from the mustard flavor that I love when having these. Good recipe for something different but if you love traditional deviled eggs you will probably only LIKE these.",

That was really good. Next time I'll use more mustard. A good tip is to put all your indredients for the inside of your eggs in a zip lock bag. Gives kids a chance to help because they can squish everything in the bag and then you just cut the tip off and squeeze into your eggs!",
