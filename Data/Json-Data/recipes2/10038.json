There are changes I'd make to it to make it better: use frozen peaches (put them in first) plain rolled oats skip the sucralose and use a little honey instead plain yogurt and only enough milk to almost cover the fruit. Also I'd add some ground flax seed for omegas. Thanks for the idea!",

Have since made some changes to suit our tastes... we eliminate the sweetener and use sweetened Original Almond Breeze almond milk in lieu of the regular milk. Also we freeze the bananas add three or four whole frozen strawberries and skip the ice entirely. I use a half cup of yogurt (instead of 1/4) and 1 cup of milk (instead of 1 1/4) to make it a bit thicker. We buy the multi-pack of fruit 'n' cream oatmeal and use whatever flavor happens to be in the front. I grind up the oatmeal packet in a coffee grinder to make it a fine powder so the final result is very smooth. This is an easy healthy and tasty recipe. Kudos to Susanb36 for posting this one we love it!!!",
