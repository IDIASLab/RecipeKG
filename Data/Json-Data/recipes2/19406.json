Here's what I did with mine and they came out perfect: (1) Cooked chicken tenders on a skillet with minced garlic salt and pepper and until cooked through. (2) Chopped up the chicken using my Ninja chopper so it was shredded into small pieces. (3) Used Ken's Healthy Options Caesar Dressing. (4) Used reduced fat shredded cheddar cheese. (5) Used Hormel bacon bits. (6) Used Land-o-Lakes Light Butter. This still isn't the healthiest sandwich in the world but if you cut the calories in a few easy no-brainer ways it doesn't hurt the flavor AT ALL. I wanted to take a new picture for this recipe to do it some justice but both paninis were gone before I had a chance!",
