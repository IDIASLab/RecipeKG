This is a great base to combine your favorite fruits or whatever fruits happen to be in season along with your favorite yogurt. I used red grapes and added in some banana. This made a ton of fruit salad - but since it's so hot and this is so refreshing that won't be a problem. I used fat-free vanilla yogurt and this made a great \"go to\" snack that was low in fat and calories. It was great spinkled with a little wheat germ on top!",

I tried this but will stick with my original from 20 yrs ago...vanilla yogurt coconut (unsweetened is fine since the yogurt and fruit gives this enough sweetness) canned drained mandarin oranges a diced apple and halved grapes. Nothing is measured you decide how much of each you want depending on how much you make too. I've even added ground flax to make it healthier. However you make a yogurt fruit salad it is always refreshing! Great summer breakfast or evening snack:)",
