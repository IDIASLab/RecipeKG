I used sake, soy sauce, asian sesame oil, and a little brown sugar as my sauce.  My mushrooms were sauteed in this sauce so they were served warm, but I'm sure you could marinate them cold too.  Experiment with the variety of mushroom you use.  This was my first time using shiitakes, and they were so meaty and tasty.",
