I was even more impressed with how well the NO Yolks noodles held their shape. This is comfort food at its finest and a recipe I will make often.",

I hadn't used sour cream for the cream of my sauce in my stroganoff before but I will again. I also added sweet red peppers which I really like in stroganoff. I prepped my noodles in a fry pan. I added my noodles to the pan and just covered with cold water. Then boiled until they were al dente. I had seen this method on youtube. It worked really good and meant that I was able to do this entire dish in one pan which was a bonus. I did have to rinse them again with hot water prior to serving. I'm actually pretty impressed with the taste and texture of the NoYolk noodles.",
