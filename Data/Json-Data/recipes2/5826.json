I like my soup salty so I added an extra 1/4 tsp of salt and I put a square of bread with mozzarella on top in the bottom of each individual crock and microwaved to melt the cheese before adding the soup; I then put another square of bread on top the soup and covered the entire top of each crock with more mozzarella and melted the cheese on the crocks under the broiler until each was ever so slightly browned. The recipe says it serves four but I used two fairly large individual bean-pot crocks and it was the perfect amount to fill both with room for the bread besides. Very hearty and filling a meal in itself. I will definitely make this again but may try swiss cheese on top next time as many similar recipes call for swiss. If you like onion soup as prepared in fine restaurants you'll like this; it's easy to make and tasty too!",
