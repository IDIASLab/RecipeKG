When we ran out of fries some seeded hamburger buns got put to good use as sloppy joes--and the kids LOVED that also! BBQ sauces tend to thin out to watery consistency in a slow cooker. I recommend NOT using corn starch to thicken the sauce; use extra BBQ sauce instead. Other welcome additions to consider using: Sauteed onions and crisp bacon bits.",
