I liked the almond extract--made it taste like marzipan which I love. My adjustments were: 1. I used almond flour instead of meal 2. I used Bobs Red Mill GF 1 to 1 baking flour instead of oat flour.  3. I added 3 more minutes to the baking time for a total of 28 minutes. This was a lovely almond flavored dessert. Like the other reviewers, I will try it with whatever fruit is in season. Yummy! Thank you VeggieCravings!",
