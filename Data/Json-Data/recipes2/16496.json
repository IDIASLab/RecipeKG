Plus you don't get the after-brunch-stomach-blues because they're not heavy at all.  I agree with other reviewers about adding a tablespoon of sugar, but with a sweet topping adding more is unecessary. About the \"too much egg\" issue,  I assume that some other reviewers didn't beat the egg whites enough. You will know when they are stiff enough when you can turn the bowl upside down and they don't fall down. One really needs an electric beater to make the egg whites stiff or else you'll lose your arm.  It is, of course, easy to remove one egg yolk if it floats your boat better.  They even taste good after a few hours, while most pancakes turn inedible.",
