I then melt an additional two tblsp of coconut oil pour half over half of the cooked popcorn then mix in half of combined spices and repeat. Seems to more evenly distribute. Also everyone has a different taste preference so at first I was a little light-handed on the spices. Like anything you can always add more later. I used garlic powder in place of fresh and chile powder in place of hot sauce. Also added a few pinches of paprika chipotle seasoning and sea salt. Nice change from regular popcorn and healthy with coconut oil as well as the spices. Thanks Spiderwoman77!",
