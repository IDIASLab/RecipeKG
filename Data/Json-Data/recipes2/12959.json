I am a chicken nugget/chicken finger lover but hate fried foods. These nuggets were wonderful and as it made so many, I have lunch/dinner for the next few days. They were easy to make and by using the plastic bag, clean-up was a breeze.\nGiven the fact that chicken breast is $24.00 per pound where I live, I am very careful about using the breasts unless  I am sure it will be worth it.  These nuggets are worth every penny of the $24.00.",

Instead of baking on a rack I put them on a foil lined pan sprayed with Crisco butter spray and backed for 15 minutes and then under the broiler for a minute.  They were perfect.  Served them with honey mustard sauce from this site.  This is my go-to chicken nugget recipe.",
