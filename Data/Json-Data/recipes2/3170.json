Too much and they will be pasty, too little and they won't get as crispy. My favorite way to eat these is with a little ketchup mixed with sriracha (a 4:1 ratio.) You can just buy a pre-made Cajun seasoning at the store (easy), or make your own by combining the spices listed.",

Fun & flavorful.\" Rather than measuring out all of the spices indicated by the recipe, I took the cook's suggestion in the description and used a Creole seasoning blend (from an AR recipe that I keep well-stocked in hinged glass jars from the craft store, fill with spice blends, and give as gifts.) This was a big time-saver for what turned out to be a side-dish success, and even moreso because my picky toddler clamored for all of the purple \"fwiez.\"",
