I took this general idea and make something similar with regular hot dogs year round. I take small biscuit dough and smoosh them down and wrap each hot dog with 1.5 biscuits. Then I just bake them according to the biscuit instructions. We call them biscuit dogs and we love them. I started using biscuit dough instead of crescent rolls because they are less fat. My dss likes them better go figure.",

I homeschool my kids and we are learning about Egypt right now. Making these edible mummies was a very enjoyable project.. Coincidentally it being so close to Halloween this was a perfect recipe for my kids to do! They are bite size and my boys just loved them. Great recipe for little hands with no real worry of working with raw ingredients such as eggs or meat. Being that small children loooove to put everything in their mouths. In fact my boys want to make them again on Halloween using regular sized hot dogs",
