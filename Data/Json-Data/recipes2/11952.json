I started preparing as is but ended up leaving one of the 28oz. cans of tomato sauce out and replacing them with 2 small cans of chili beans and one small can of pinto beans. At that point there was plenty of tomato product going on and I ended up leaving out the tomato paste as well. Not sure if it was the Rotel or what but this had a very vinegar-y flavor going on in the end. I loved that aspect and the reason is because I grew up in Kansas City and both sides of my family added a splash of vinegar to their bowls so this was right up my alley. Mom always said it helped neutralize the grease but who knows? All I know is that I got used to having that vinegar splash and have a hard time eating chili without it. The chorizo did make this pretty oily but it added nice flavor too.",
