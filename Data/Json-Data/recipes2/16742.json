Instead of the coffee flavored liqueur I instead added a teaspoon of instant decafe coffee. Also instead of the banana liqueur I added a whole banana and a tablespoon of brown sugar. The rest of the recipe I kept the same. While I found the chocolate and coffee slightly overbearing my children loved it. I will most likely make this again.",
