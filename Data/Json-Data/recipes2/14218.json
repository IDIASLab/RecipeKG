I made the entire quantity called for without thinking too hard about it (with only a few friends coming over) so naturally we had a bunch left over at the end of the night (even though everyone loved it and was slurping down cup after cup) -- it makes a ton. This is the super-cool part though: since I didn't want to throw the rest away I stuck it in the fridge (even though I was pretty sure that I was being a moron since the soda would obviously lose its fizz before I would drink or serve it again...). Well FOUR DAYS LATER I pulled it out of the fridge mixed it with some more lemon-lime soda and it was JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TIME. This stuff ROCKS. Every single person who tried it absolutely loved it. Couldn't get enough.",
