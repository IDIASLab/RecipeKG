I used to make a similar recipe for marinara sauce on the stove, but never had the time to just let it go and cook longer than 30 minutes. Using the instant pot, this recipe is excellent with no changes needed--the flavors come through and is perfect!  I added a a little sugar (1 - 1.5 tsp sugar) as we tend to get heartburn from tomato sauces. After releasing the pressure and using the immersion blender, I added Gluten Free Turkey Meatballs by Olivia to the sauce and left the Instant Pot on Keep Warm while I made the pasta. The meatballs paired well with the sauce and made an excellent pasta and meatballs dinner for us! Looking forward to making another batch of this sauce to freeze. Thanks for another great Instant Pot recipe, Bren!",

The tomato-y flavor is deep and rich, good blend of herbs, and I\u2019ve always added red wine to my marinara, so I liked that as well.  I had to run out for an appointment right as the cooking cycle was complete, so I just let the pressure release naturally.  The sauce was a bit on the thin side for us (personal taste preference), so I just turned on the Saute function, and cooked it down for about 5 minutes.  Always on the hunt for good Instant Pot\u00ae recipes, and this is a good one!  This will go on a meatball hoagie tomorrow, and the rest will head to the freezer.  Thanks for sharing.",

But oregano really packs a punch and to get more flavor, I also added 1 lg green pepper and 2 large stalks celery that we pulsed in the food processor, then saut\u00e9ed with the onion at the beginning step.",

My finished sauce was a bit thinner than ideal ( given the aforementioned the recipe cannot be faulted). The addition of sun dried tomatoes is brilliant and gives the sauce a solid, bright tomato flavor. Using quality ingredients, I can\u2019t imagine how this recipe could go wrong.",
