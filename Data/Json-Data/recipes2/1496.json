I went easy on the peppers because I don't care for them much and used a mixture of eggs and egg substitute as I made 1.5 times the recipe and wanted to lighten it up a bit. It took a little longer to cook for me than the recipe called for but that wasn't a problem.  We ate some leftovers on Saturday and it reheated well.  Another nice aspect was that I cooked up the sausage, pepper, and onions the night before so I could just put it together in the morning and catch a few extra minutes of sleep.  Definite keeper!",
