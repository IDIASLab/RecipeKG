I had two large butterfly pork chops so I halved all of the liquid and only used a couple of shots of beer (thanks previous reviewers). I also subbed several tablespoons of a prepared jerk seasoning in place of the list of jerk spices. Smelled soooo good on the grill and I loved the light carmelization from the molasses and rum balanced by the saltiness of the soy sauce. Will definitely use this one again!",

Once I poured over the chops the aroma I knew it was going to be delightful. I cut down on the Rum and used a ginger puree. I cut down too on the nutmeg and cinnamon (I was only using 4 chops). I used Red Stripe Lager (Jamaican Beer). My family was loving this and asked for me to make it again. I only marinaded this for about 7 hours though. It would be fantastic if used with Chicken or on Ribs (as another reviewer stated). Thank you so much for sharing....",

I did detect the subtle flavoring from the spices and the sweetness and little spicy kick all came together quite well and the meat was tender and very juicy for pork. The only change I made was dried marjoram spice instead of fresh and couldn't find a scotch bonnet pepper so used a small jalapeno from my garden.",
