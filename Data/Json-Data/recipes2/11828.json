I did not stray too far from the recipe but I certainly did not measure out any ingredients either. They did not lack flavor as suggested by another reviewer. I always roll my burgers and then place them in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before flattening and cooking. This helps them to stay together through cooking and enhances any flavors added...I was asked to make these again once barbecue season is back.",

I also let the meat sit for half an hour while my side cooked (Honey Roasted Red Potatoes found on this site) Finally I seared each patty on high and finished off in the oven. I will definitely make this again. Lots of flavor great aroma. Paired great with Andrew Will Semillon...",
