It contained 2 packages of seedless red or black grapes 8 oz. cream cheese 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 to 1 cup of chopped pecans. The cream cheese and sugar gets blended together with the pecans and grapes being folded in until coated. It is a wonderful fruit salad that just happens to have just grapes. I know it is a preference thing but I've had sooo many people ask me for the recipe. Nancy's recipe sounds great too...if not a little \"lighter\" with the whipped cream instead of sugar. Anyway hope you enjoy.",
