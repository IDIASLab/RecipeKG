Don't waste time separating the flesh from the skin instead throw the whole thing (minus the stem and the seeds) in the blender after it has baked in the oven. Another tip: Microwave the kabocha for 5 minutes before halving it. It makes it a bit easier to cut.",

I ate three big bowls of it before I could stop! I don't eat spicy food so I omitted the curry paste and it was still amazing. Also I doubled the recipe though I only had one can of coconut milk but it was enough. I baked the kabocha for an hour which turned out to be a bit too long because it was mush by then. At that point it's hard to separate the skin so I'll bake it for less time in the future. I'll be making this again very soon!",
