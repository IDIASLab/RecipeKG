I saut\u00e9ed onion first in ghee added two heaps of minced garlic and then added defrosted peas in same pan along with red pepper flakes (3 pinches). S&P followed then added 3/4 cup spinach. If you like spinach be sure to add the whole cup and maybe just a tad more on top of that. I ran out of cream so I added half and half to the sauce however be sure to add the full 2 cups if not more. After the sauce reduces you'll miss the extra bit of liquid as the noodles absorb the sauce very quickly. I love the cheesiness of this sauce by the way-such a great flavor with the few revisions. I covered the casserole with a thick layer of panko crumbs because we like the extra crunch. A real easy dish and a clear winner in our home.",

We used green onions at the beginning and added green beans instead of peas. I also added the tuna to the pot as I was adding the cream and other ingredients so that it would absorb more flavor. We also love herbs so we added cilantro oregano and a lemon and Himalayan salt blend from Trader Joe s to the original mixture ( Has a small amount of onion and garlic when ground). We also added more diced green onion to the top of the casserole as well as toasted gluten-free diced bread before cooking. We sprayed this lightly with avocado oil spray. We cooked with aluminum foil for 15 minutes and then for 5 minutes without to brown the top. LOVED IT! Tasted just like my mom used to make. May try it with a dairy-free milk next time like one user suggested.",
