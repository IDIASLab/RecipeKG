I sauteed some onion and green pepper to start then added the beef and baked beans. I used powder Worcestershire and 1/2 cup salsa and a touch of brown sugar to make get the beans just perfect then topped off the casserole with the mashed potatoes. I only had Monterrey jack cheese on hand and it worked great. It browned beautifully and tasted fabulous. I never would have thought to put beans and mashed potatoes in a casserole but it was great.

Also it needs something as far as flavor because it is bland. I think I'll use Sriracha or adobe sauce with chipotle instead of tomato sauce next time. I also advise to avoid using the bland canned corned beef. It will be nothing but texture here. This would be a great recipe for leftover homemade corned beef. It needs a flavor kick to get the next star for us. Thank you for the recipe.",

It is also a keeper because it is so easy and fast thus making it great for busy evenings. My family liked it enough to have more often than once a year. As for those who found it dull I wonder if maybe the beans were the problem. Since they are one of few ingredients their flavor matters. I used beans we all like a lot with red peppers etc...I think by Bush's. The definitely say \"Grillin'\" on the can. Thanks for the recipe! I cook a ton and never would have thought to put baked beans and potatoes together in a casserole. Just goes to show you CAN teach an old dog new tricks.;)",
