The only difference I made was adding a full container (15 oz) of cheese whiz 1extra tbsp of sour cream and one package of dry onion soup mix. I also added 1 cup of shredded sharp cheese just to let my family know that this was indeed a cheese dip. The salad dressing(miracle whip) makes this recipe sweet so tweak it to your own taste!!! Happy dipping!!!",
