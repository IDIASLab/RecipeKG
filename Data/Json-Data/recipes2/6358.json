So I started playing around with ingredients and tweaking it each time. I finally produced something that my kids and husband love. In fact, I make a batch at least two times a week. I call them breakfast cookies because they are healthy enough to eat in the morning! No sugar added, naturally sweetened with honey and chocolate chips to lure the kids. No preservatives or additives, just wholesome goodness!",

I saw 1 cup of honey and thought holy mother of sweetness honey is quite a but sweeter than sugar so I don't know how unbearable it would be had I used the full cup. I did 1\\2 cup honey plus 3 tbsp brown sugar for a molasses-y flavor and the were still very very sweet. It's still not healthy to be eating so much sugar even if it is unprocessed. Other than that the cookie was good. I didn't have ground flax only whole; so to offset the binding effect I used 1 whole egg plus 1\\4 cup cornstarch. I lowered the cinnamon since I'm not a big fan, and used cranberries and almonds in half the batch and the other half I used chocolate chips.\nI'll probably make again and lower the honey further. It's a good starter recipe for a somewhat healthy breakfast cookie.",

I made 2 slight modifications I used two whole eggs (not just the whites) and used Sunflower Seed Butter instead of almond butter since it's all I had oh and I threw in a tablespoon or two of hemp and millet as I figured it would work will with the granola! I really like the taste of these if my kids do too I'll make them again and maybe even in the shape of a granola bar for a bigger snack portion.",
