                "reviewBody": "I wanted to give this a test run before using 1 3/4 cups of Sriracha so I scaled the recipe down. I didn't realize until just now that the ratio of Sriracha to vinegar changes a great deal when doing this. It still turned out great but would have been a lot thicker if I would have made it with the full 8 servings that calls for 1/2 less vinegar than Sriracha. With that being said I will most definitely make a full batch to keep in the fridge. It would be great on fish and pork as well. The one thing I wasn't 100% thrilled with was the maple syrup but only because I'm not a big fan of that flavor. You really need the sugar to get that sticky goodness so I think I will use honey when I make it again. I used this on chicken breast that were enormous so to get the flavor of the marinade throughout the chicken I sliced the breast up in small pieces prior to sticking them in the marinade. Great recipe with a nice kick! Thanks for sharing!",

But this was ho-hum.\" I liked the ease of this recipe and having the ingredients available. I guess knowing how much of it to use on what amount/weight of chicken would've been helpful because I marinated two chicken breasts with approximately 1 c. of this marinade covered in the fridge for 5 hrs. and I felt like the chicken tasted more like the apple cider vinegar with a light spicy tickle in the back of my throat. I want to be punched in the face from hot sauce so maybe I should've marinated in more than a cups' worth. I like the idea of swapping syrup for honey too. Bock bock buzz buzz.",
