There were so many different textures and flavors going on it was so delicious. I doubled the whole cream sauce because we dislike dry food and used 1 1/4c heavy cream and 1 1/4 c 2% milk. I made this as a side dish but it could easily be the main dish. Served with Baslamic glazed trout and a bottle of pinot Noir. Very wonderful!!",

I didn't have cloves or milk so substituted 2 tsp dill and fat free half and half. The dash of nutmeg gave a suprising hint of sweetness in the final dish. I also don't have a plethora of saute pans so sauted the onion mushroom asparagus and peppers in butter in one and simmered the cream butter dill bay leaf and nutmeg in another. I whisked in the flour in the same pan after removing the bay leaf. I shreded the smoked salmon and added it to the sauted veggies about 5 minutes before I added the tortellini and sauce just to heat it through. A great bowl food recipe and great use of the last of my alaskan smoked salmon before my next trip there this summer. I'm eager to see how it freezes. It's in my recipe box.",
