It came out great although I followed instructions from the woman selling the crabs and only boiled 14 minutes on med-high. I did not have any dill or mustard seed and I threw a little Old Bay in the pot also. Since my pot is not a 5 gallon I did 4 crabs at a time. They came out wonderful. The crabs at the top of the pot had a very mild spiced flavor and the ones that got to sit at the bottom were more heavily spiced but the crab flavor was perfect -- not overly strong and not weak or bland. Next time I will boil 2 at a time and we will eat one pair while the next pair is cooking so they don't get cold. The colder they are the harder they are to take apart. It took us almost an hour and fifteen minutes to eat but it was great for conversation! Thanks for the recipe!",
