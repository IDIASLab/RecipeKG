The meat(if any) is cooked before being rolled in the wrapper. The veggies are normally raw or(rarely) lightly steamed. They're like a little salad in a wrapper. I love them in summer. In Thai cooking springrolls use a rice paper wrapper and is eaten raw, eggrolls use a thin wonton(wheat paper) wrapper and is eaten fried. What may have confused some of you is that the recipe just says springroll wrappers. The chinese ones are wheat and are not meant to be dipped in water but fried. The thai and vietnamese ones are rice, stiff and meant to be softened in water and eaten raw. In my area the package just says rice paper, nothing about springrolls.",

I was doubtful it was going to all come together, but they surprised me! Just do what was the recipe says, wrap em tight, and dip away!

Had a lot of the watercress mixture left over, so I'd cut that in half in the future.  Recipe said to  mix long slices of the carrot into the watercress mixture, but I don't see how that would work for the spring roll filling, so I did a coarse shred on the carrot.  Same comment on the bean sprouts, cut them up a bit.  Takes a little bit of practice using the rice spring roll wrappers, but although they may not have been pretty, they tasted great!",
