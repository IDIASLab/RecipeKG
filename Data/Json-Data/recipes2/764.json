I toasted the coconut, replaced the pecans with almonds, and toasted some sesame seeds and also tucked a few of those inside with the almond.  Used a few different kinds of chocolate(semi-sweet, german, unsweetened) mixed together. **Tip for a nice sheen-add a tbsp. of shortening (not butter) to the chocolate while melting. **Tip #2-toast the nuts for a depth of floavor and to avoid bitterness.  Just toss them around in a hot dry pan on stovetop until toasted.  I'm still a double-boiler gal. these tasted absolutely delish, present so well, easy to make, and have an incredible taste. the nut(and the sesame) gave it a sweet/salty mix.  Loved it.  thanks so much.",
