The cream cheese taste was subtle which was a good thing to me because I don't think I'd like a milkshake that tasted like cheesecake. I used chocolate frozen yogurt for the fat reduction and it was good this way. Something different to present the guests with for a summer get-together. Plus it was a good way to use up some leftover cream cheese.",

Awesome!\n2nd time: low fat cappuccino chip ice cream with 1/3 less fat cream cheese and skim milk tastes great!!\n3rd time: Adding choc chips is useless, they sink to the bottom of the blender and glass.",

It tasted just like a chocolate milkshake. I couldn't taste the cream cheese at all even when I doubled up on the cream cheese the 2nd time making it. I feel it just added all the calories and fat to my shake without changing the flavor. I used a Premium Chocolate Icecream...maybe that was the problem? Maybe a cheaper chocolate would be better but I'm not sure. I don't think I'll be making it again to test it.",
