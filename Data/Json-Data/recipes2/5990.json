I recommend adding in the carrot and zucchini at the tail end of step 3. No need to cook the beef for 90 mins until tender, then have to add in the veggies for additional cooking time. Also, I recommend cooking the pasta when the soup is almost fully cooked. If you cook it too early, it'll sit there and clump up. Another option would be to just toss the uncooked pasta into the soup in the last few mins of cooking.  I'm looking forward to having this for lunch again tomorrow! Yum!",
