Added rice vinegar.  Added red pepper flakes.  Added all to taste, found needed less soy than recipe suggested.  Used \"fresh\" riced cauliflower not frozed, so added some diced carrots and some green beans I had on hand.  Added some pork loin cut up in small pieces so it would cook quickly.  Whole thing took about 10-15 minutes to cook.",

We had some left over, and I had it the next day for lunch.  It tasted even better the second day.  My husband  liked it so well that he asked me to make it again soon.",

Otherwise very easy to make and tastes pretty good. Tip to keep cauliflower nice and light coloured soak cauliflower in cold water for 20 minutes prior to cooking it and pour the soya sauce onto the bottom of the skillet not on top of cauliflower.",
