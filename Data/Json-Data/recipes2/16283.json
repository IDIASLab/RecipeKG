The 'puff' makes for a delicate crust and requires that you cut it into small pieces. I forgot to poke holes in the dough and it poofed up until it cooled. The only thing I did different from the recipe was leave out the Gorgonzola (I didn't have any). If you like sun dried tomatoes then you need to try it for your next snooty high-falutin' party...if you've never tasted sun dried tomatoes then you need to try it!",

The cook time for the puff pastry is perfect be sure to poke holes so it doesn't puff out otherwise just crunch it down when you put on your topping. My changes: 1. Used a rolling pin to make the puff pastry longer to make a bigger thinner crust pizza. 2. Folded over the edges and sealed with a fork to make a crusty rim. 3. Used lots of cooking spray on tin foil to ensure it didn't stick. 4. Spooned on spaghetti sauce as a pizza base about 2/3 a cup. 5. Used my available cheese 1/2 mozzarella 1/2 goat cheese crumbled up. Then I just sprinkled some shredded cheddar because I had it and why not? 6. Cooked up 3 bacon slices and chopped them and sprinkled them on. 7. Chopped up a couple slices of deli ham and added it. We are stranded in a snow storm so I just threw on what we had but it turned out AMAZING. The goat cheese side was the best.",
