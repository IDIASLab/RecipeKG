I will definitely make these again and the only ingredient change I would make is to use yellow onion instead of green onion. I was a little lazy so I just mixed in the 1/2 c salsa with the other ingredients instead of putting on each one--worked fine. My tortillas were a little smaller than called for so I was able to make 6 that were stuffed with filling. I served with additional sour cream and salsa.",

The seasoning from the rice itself gives this a lot of flavor without being at all spicy which works for wussy me and my kids! You could definitely kick up the heat of that's what you like. This is one of those recipes that is a great guideline but can be customized to whatever you like.",
