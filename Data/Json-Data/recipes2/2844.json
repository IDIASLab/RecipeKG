Most of the general ingredients were in my pantry.  I used de-cased italian turkey sausage, a jar of pasta sauce, and a can of diced tomatoes, as well as a 12oz box of farfelle noodles because I had all that stuff on hand.  Also subbed cottage for ricotta because that's what I had.  Sauteed some onion & bell pepper with the sausage.  Diced the fresh mozz fine.  It was done in about 40 minutes and made great leftovers.  This will definitely go into the regular rotation.  Although this wasn't exactly lasagna, it was waaaay better than regular old spaghetti!!",

I would drain the fat from the pan after cooking the sausages next time.  I used \"oven ready\" (no pre-cooking required) lasagna noodles which were great and used shredded mozzarella cheese for easy melting.  I used fresh baby spinach and should have torn or sliced it into thin strips which would facilitate it cooking quicker since you add the spinach once you take the skillet off the heat.  Lastly, I added as others have suggested, 1/2 tsp fresh garlic, 1/2 tsp dried basil and 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning. Do check on this after about 15 minutes as I didn't and mine started to burn to the bottom of the pan!",
