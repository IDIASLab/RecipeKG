I had all the ingredients on hand and this one sounded really good - and it was! Of course the calorie count will depend on what whey protein you use (they vary greatly) and also your yogurt and almond milk choices. I used Optimum Nutrition French Vanilla Creme whey Dannon Light & Fit vanilla greek non-fat yogurt and Blue Diamond original sweetened almond/coconut blend. The calories came out to only 290 per serving and the serving size is VERY generous (I got to fill up my glass twice - YAY!). It is plenty filling and perfect as a quick breakfast or after-workout snack. Thank you Lela I'll be making this again and again!",

I had to go with what I had on hand so I used plain Greek yogurt (adding a small amount of vanilla extract) and vanilla soy milk in place of the almond milk. I don't like to change out ingredients like that but sometimes you have no choice if you really want to make it. The texture was excellent and I didn't miss the usual banana. All-around great smoothie Lela!",
