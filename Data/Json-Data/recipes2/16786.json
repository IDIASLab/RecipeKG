I also added some fresh chopped chilies to fry also. It really bring the taste out but be careful not to add too much if you don't like it spicy. When adding my shredded chicken to my onions. I stirred that around for awhile before adding the salsa to bring the flavor to the chicken. Before leaving it to simmer add some ground cumin and coriander. And taste it to see if it needs any cayenne powder. About half way through simmering add some black beans. And last but not least toast your flour tortillas. I put mine in the toaster and turned out Excellent! Don't forget your sour cream and enjoy. I will defiantly make again! My Husband Loved it!!!",

I also followed the advice of some of the previous reviews and added garlic and fresh chopped jalapeno to my onions. I added the chicken and the picante sauce and spiced it up with some ground cumin and salt and I added a can of black beans (YUM). When I served this I put it into a big bowl and added fresh chopped cilantro for flavor and garnish. I served it with warm flour tortillas and spanish rice. I think that next time I will try this with a jar of taco sauce instead of the picante sauce and add my own green and red peppers.",
