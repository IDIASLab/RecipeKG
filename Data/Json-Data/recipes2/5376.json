The buttery walnuts temper the fire of the mashed garlic and pair beautifully with the aromatic, bittersweet parsley.

My lemon was super juicy so I would do 1/2 the lemon next time taste it and then add from there as needed. This IS super versatile! So far I've used this as a dipping sauce for veggies and pita bread(YUM!) and as a spread on my turkey sandwich. I could totally see using this on grilled chicken or even roasted corn on the cob. I also like that this didn't make a ton so it was the perfect amount for us. I will be making this again for sure! Thanks for sharing.:)",

Must confess, I doubled the amount of walnuts, which I rinsed a couple of times to remove any bitterness, used an equal amount of chopped parsley stems, 2 large garlic cloves, the zest of the lemon as well as the juice, olive oil and a pinch of kosher salt. Used my little cuisinart chopper/grinder which did a fine job! I tossed it on pasta as well as had it on some cold thinly sliced steak. Yum!",
