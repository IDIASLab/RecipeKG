For the dressing (which I did not double--was enough for me) I also added about a tablespoon of taco seasoning to kick it up a bit. I also burned the crispies so I just crumbled up a few tortilla chips for topping. Like Applebee's I also served it with a dallop of sour cream a dallop of salsa and a dallop of homemade guacamole.
