I seasoned mine with salt pepper garlic powder onion powder and some of my home made Italian seasoning (crushed sun dried tomatoes basil oregano dried garlic etc). I didn't have any smoked cheese so I added a little bit of smoked paprika also. Still this dish was really good and my family loved it. I suggest to anyone to experiment with it some more and make it their own.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was seriously saved by the review of Terry E. I sauteed some roasted garlic chicken sausage as that is what I had. I like sausage crisp so I wasn't going to bake it raw. Like that reviewer I added the same additions: I did 1/2 green pepper sliced 1 large garlic clove minced and 1/4 small white onion sliced. After sauteing the sausage slices I turned the heat down and slightly caramelized those ingredients. I also added a pinch of garlic salt and a 1/2 cup extra cheese to thicken it as I found the sauce thin and in need of some extra flavor. I liked all of the ingredients but there was an after taste of the tin can to the sauce. I am not against using canned sauces or soups on occasion to save time as long as they blend well with the rest of the ingredients in the dish. It was fine for my family this evening just not a dish I would serve to guests.",

I could see the sauce was on the watery side so while the pasta was cooking I simmered the sauce and tomatoes with some black pepper to thicken it a little and It really did seem to make a difference.
