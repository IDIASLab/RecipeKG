I sauteed the whites from the green onions with the peas and carrots while my rice was cooking.  I then added the rice to the veggies with about 1/4 cup soy sauce.  In a small skillet, I scrambled the 2 eggs and added to the rice with some ground ginger (I didn't have fresh) and the greens from the onions.  Whole thing took about 10 mintues to make and it turned out pretty good.  Brown rice made it a little too nutty, so next time I'll stick with white rice.  Thanks for the recipe!",
