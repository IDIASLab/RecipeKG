I used lamb and seasoned it with garlic s&p and a ton of Greek oregano. Then I threw in a large handful of chopped kalamata olives black beans tomato sauce and salsa. I only had 6 large tortillas so I rolled them fatty style. I added feta and shredded mozzarella to each tortilla before rolling. I topped with more tomato sauce the leftover meat salsa and mozzerella. Oh my goodness it was tasty!!!!!! I will make this again!!!!",
