Next time I will increase the ingredients (as one serving here is like....really small--I like my coffee beefy and I'll tell you I added the frozen yogurt and the small amount of coffee called for and my blender actually laughed at me. Could be because I have a wimpy blender I really don't know) and I might use my pre-made bulk dry cocoa mix. This was quick to throw together with on hand ingredients when I want a blended coffee but don't want to drive to Starbucks and it's easily bendable to make your own however you want. I appreciated it that's for sure. Noone wants to see me in my jammies at Starbucks.;)",
