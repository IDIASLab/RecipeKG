I reduced the amount of Chicken broth to 6 cups just because I preferred a little more substance than soup.  I didn't have any shallots, so I finely chopped a medium sized sweet onion and stir fried that with the bell peppers & minced garlic.    Other than adding some black beans, everything else was as shown.  I may add a green veggie next time (chopped spinach or broccoli maybe), but this is definitely a keeper.  Lots of things you can do with this!  Thanks again!",
