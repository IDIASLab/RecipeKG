(If you don't, then why are you even considering it?!)  One thing, though - when she tells you to cover the beans as completely as possible, she isn't kidding.  I didn't have enough hot dogs and the sauce from the beans bubbled up through the cornbread, so it was kind of wet at the bottom and oozed out a little when I cut it into it.  I just put it back in the oven for a few minutes and it was fine.  But next time I may try that layer of grated cheese another reviewer suggested.  As it is, my husband and I ate the whole thing!",
