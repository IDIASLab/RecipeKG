Before I chopped the above ingredients and then sauteed I chopped 6 small red and purple potatoes added evoo tarragon a sea salt herb blend and then oven roasted for about a half hour. Then I blended all the veggies and potato together added the soup (3 cans & 3 cups milk)sour cream and peas. EVERYONE went WILD over this!! Didn't share my secret since the unexpected guests are food snobs. Served w/ a spinach salad. Have also made it since omitted the potato and served over brown rice or herb and wild rice---in this instance used a little less milk instead of soup it's a savory sauce. Thanks Lois for a fabulous recipe I would NEVER had tried this w/ canned soup before!",

I sauteed fresh sliced baby Bella mushrooms yellow onion and the asparagus. I try to keep my butter intake light so cut back on some of the butter & added some olive oil to make up the difference for the sautee. I added herbs to the sautee mix (garlic salt garlic powder a pinch of dill a dash of black pepper and some freshly chopped parsley). Instead of Sour Cream I used Laughing Cow Light Swiss wedges (Qty 3). It turned out great and my skeptical boyfriend was singing praises once he actually tried it. Definitely making this again! I loved how thick the soup turned out too.",
