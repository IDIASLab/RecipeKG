No peppers in the tomatoes either - I'm deathly allergic to them (hubby puts his in on the side). I upped the cheese layer and made a standard batch of cornbread instead of mix (don't use mixes). Cut down to four servings (for two) had enough for a rerun for lunch.\n\nWe really like it and hubby said \"save it!\"",
