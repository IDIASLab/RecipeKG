When I came across this recipe, I decided to give it a try and see if they were as good as what I remember the originals to be.  We loved this recipe.  It's not too sweet.  I used a little less than a cup of honey which was perfect for our tastes.  I also added a couple tablespoons ground flaxseed meal, and I doubled the vanilla.  I used natural crunchy peanut butter.  The texture is softer than the original, but they set just fine.  The texture is great...creamy and a little chewy from the oats.  This one's a keeper for us.  I think it would work great with agave or brown rice syrup, too.",

Easy to make, wholesome ingredients and super DELICIOUS. I made some adjustments, however.  1) Substituted brown rice syrup for honey  2) used only 3/4 cup brown rice syrup instead of 1 cup - came out PERFECT   3) added 1/2 tsp of salt   4) doubled the vanilla.  Also, I live in Southern California - it gets warm inside my house no matter what season it is.  So I threw these in the freezer for 10 minutes and keep it in the refrigerator between taking bites!  Just a warning: these melt really quickly, they are wonderfully messy on your fingers!  I have now shared them with many people and no matter what the \"taste bud\" range, they have LOVED them.  TRUST ME: SO DELICIOUS!  MUST TRY!  Thank you for this recipe!",

When the DH compared them he said that this recipe tasted more like dark chocolate even though I used the same cocoa powder in both.
