Pork, more than any other meat, needs to be right at the number or it will be dry and tasteless.  I set my digital for 143 degrees for chops and when the buzzer goes off I pull them out and cover for 3-4 min.  The temp will rise to 145 degrees.  You can get a Maverick digital at Lowes or Home Depot for about 26.00 and it will pay for itself in no time.  All ovens cook differently and if you just go by the time recommended in recipes it will be hit or miss.",
