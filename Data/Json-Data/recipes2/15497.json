I used half wild rice and half white and added some sauteed carrots onions and celery that I cooked until tender in equal amounts of butter and olive oil. I also added a package of \"fruitlings\" which are chopped up bits of dried fruit and a handful of slivered almonds and tossed the mixture well. This was much more flavorful and even though I didn't follow the recipe I ended up creating a family favorite. Thanks for the staring poing Brandi.",

The white rice turned to mush. I cooked the rice in beef broth. When done I added onion garlic and celery cooked tender in a little olive oil along with the peas cranberries and toasted walnuts. Nothing saved it. It's still mush. I think with fluffy wild rice it would have been very good just don't use white rice.",
