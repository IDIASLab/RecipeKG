The first one I tried was \"Rosemary Chicken with Orange-Maple Glaze\". Both are outstanding. For this recipe I used Linda's recipe more as an inspiration for a chicken dish. I used two boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of pork. I DID NOT marinate the chicken. I simply sprinkled each breast with kosher salt black pepper and Red Robin seasoning (which is basically a season salt). I cooked the breasts about 7 minutes on each side in some olive oil. Meanwhile I doubled the sauce recipe. I used pomegranate juice (the stuff in the curvy small bottle at the grocery). I did not use an actual pomegranate at any point. After I cooked the chicken breasts on each side for 7 minutes I poured the sauce over the chicken & quickly scraped up the bits of chicken and flavors from the bottom of the pan. I put a lid on the pan and simmered for 15 minutes. Then I removed the chicken to a plate added a tablespoon of butter to the sauce and about a tablespoon of brown sugar (the pomegranate juice is pretty tart & the honey wasn't enough to overcome it). I simmered the sauce for 1 more minute then spooned it over the chicken breasts brown rice & peas. This was excellent and a really nice change of pace for chicken. Thanks again Linda for the recipe inspiration. I look forward to trying your other recipes!",
