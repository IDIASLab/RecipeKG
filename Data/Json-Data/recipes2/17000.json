The taste of the sauce and the recipe itself was excellent. I'm going to be making this again and again. Please note that the chow mein noodles in the recipe are hard chow mein noodles. I wrote this along with a bunch of other stuff down on my shopping list and ended up buying soft chow mein noodles which I ended up using for something else because it would have been too many soft noodles with the angel hair. It's an great recipe though and I highly recommend it. I'll be using it twice a month.",
