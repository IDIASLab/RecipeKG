I'm on a diet program right now with very specific requirements and as much as I want to lose the weight I hate giving up foods that I love and eating food that \"feels like\" diet food. This was perfect for the chili that made with that little bit of heat to give it a good kick. Hubby even loved it lean ground turkey and all. I only used about a tablespoon of the mix for 7 oz. of meat mixed with tomatoes onions etc. Next time I may add some cumin to the mix and cut back on the season salt. One thing I did was after everything had been prepared I sprinkled a little powdered stevia on top and folded it in. It was a nice touch which makes me think I'll do it again. Either way thanks for this great recipe!",
