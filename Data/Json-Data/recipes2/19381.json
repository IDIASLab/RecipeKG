I even substituted green beans for the garbanzo beans once to reduce the carb count and it was yummy. I've also used chopped vidalia onion when I didn't have green onions on hand and enjoyed that too. The possibilities are endless! FYI: In a time crunch, I used zesty italian dressing instead of making the one recommended. While it was good, it wasn't as tasty as the homemade recipe. I would take the extra time to make it next time and always make sure to mix it up in advance to allow the flavors to marinate and develop.",
