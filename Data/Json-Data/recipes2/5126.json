The flavor was slightly bland though but this was easily fixed by sprinkling some salt on the cooked \"muffins\". I'd recommend adding in 1/2 tsp of salt to the mix. I also added in about a tsp of garlic to make these more flavorful. Mine took 20 mins to cook and they weren't very brown. Next time I'll cook them at a higher temp so they brown more (375-400 F) for a shorter time. These are definitely a good base for experimenting with different ingredients. They are rather small though so plan on at least 2 per person.",
