I did make a few minor modifications but I think the dish without alterations would be good. First I sauteed the onion with some garlic and chopped green pepper before adding the meat to brown. I don't know what ranch-style beans are so I used black beans. Following some reviewers comments I added a can of creamed corn. And I put the whole thing in the slowcooker. Throughout the week I served this in different ways and it always was delicious especially with some homemade southern style cornbread. I'll certainly make this again.",
