It's missing a few very important ingredients like for starters  PARMESAN CHEESE and the OG's would be hard to 'exactly' duplicate as they have a few secret ingredients (sorry) .. and no cream cheese @ all... I was looking for a lighter sauce that is not as heavy .. and this was good but I did add Parmesan and no garlic 'salt'.. just a lot of fresh garlic and it was good. .. and quick.. thnks!",

I decreased the cream cheese to 1/2 cup and used heavy cream instead of half and half but it still tasted SWEET and overpoweringly of cream cheese! When I think of Alfredo sauce, I think garlicy, not sweet! I couldn't eat this and add to add A LOT of spices and crushed red pepper just to make it somewhat edible for my husband. My husband said that the \"restaurant\" this recipe came from must have gone out of business if the rest of the food was this bad.",

Next time I plan to melt the butter (I used margarine) and then cream it with the cream cheese (I used Fat Free turned out GREAT!) before adding the half and half and the spices. I used an 8 oz block of cream cheese and 1.25 cups of half and half. For the other people that said the flavor was too mild they just need to add more seasonings. I just kept adding more lemon pepper and garlic until it was tangy and yummy. After cooking the sauce and the pasta I mixed it all together and left it for a few minutes to soak up the flavor. YUMMY! Will definitely make this recipe again. Thanks!",
