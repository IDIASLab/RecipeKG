Freeze the bananas the night before so that they take the place of the ice. If you add enough almond butter, this can taste exactly like banana bread. Or if you add chocolate or espresso, it tastes like bananas dipped in chocolate fondue. This can easily be a dessert smoothie!!",

So the actual recipe is 2 servings and not 1 which explains the high calorie count. I have to agree with the other reviewer that said this is filling. To me that is a good thing.",
