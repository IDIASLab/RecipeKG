My tomatoes were really bland so I marinated them for an hour in the artichoke marinade and I feel that added some additional flavor. Stored them in a plastic bag and ended up pouring a couple tablespoons of olive oil mixed with about a tablespoon or so of balsamic vinegar and they were delicious. I did triple the recipe and used essentially the amount of olive oil called for in the original. You definitely need the longer bamboo toothpicks to make this work.",

I found small marinated mozzarella & decided to use that. I poured some of that marinade in a bowl & marinated cut in half varied flavor cocktail/grape tomatoes for about an hour (I did add a little balsamic vinegar to the marinade). I used 4 inch decorative toothpicks & alternated folded Italian meats cut in half small mozzarella a piece of tomato a black olive & then repeated (except for the black olive). I tried to use 2 different types of meat & tomatoes on each skewer to make it more decorative. Not only did it look great everyone loved them!!!! I will definitely be making this again & next time I will take a picture!!",
