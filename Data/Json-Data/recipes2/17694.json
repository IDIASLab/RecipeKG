I'll bet cashews would be good in it if you don't have the pine nuts.  My kids loved it and didn't say anything about the onions.  Wow...what an accomplishment!",

Hint: More finely-chopped chicken needs more mayo. Reduce the chopped parsley to 1/2 cup. I had to use dried tarragon which I increased to 1 tbsp. Dice the celery so it's less distracting. Consider swapping halved red grapes for the raisins. Not including salt and pepper is a big oversight. Use a pinch of each. Mix well and refrigerate at least several hours or overnight for the flavors to blend.",
