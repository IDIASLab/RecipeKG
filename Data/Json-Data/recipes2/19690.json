First of all if you can get whole garam masala (combo of cumin seeds corriander seeds bay leaves fennel seeds cloves cinnamon and cardamom) it makes all the difference. Fry it up before you add the onions until it gets fragrant. Also instead of adding cream add a tablespoon or two of light sour cream. Adds the creaminess without so many calories. Since its cold make sure you temper it (add some of the hot curry sauce into the sour cream to bring up the temperature so it doesn't curdle then add the hot sour cream mix). Also since I'm a health freak instead of adding peas and paneer use edamame (soy) beans and fried tofu chunks. Lastly make sure you simmer the sauce at the end for a while gets rid of the canned tomato taste. Not quite authentic recipe but easy and tasty.",
