I made it with a few modifications - instead of egg noodles I used Cellentani noodles (or spiraly elbows as I like to call them), instead of chopped onion I used onion powder, and I added garlic salt, pepper, and parsley flakes. I also only needed 14 slices of cheese instead of 16. All in all, I think this recipe is really great! It tastes great, I love the texture, and the cheese is a nice addition. Plus, you can be really flexible with the ingredients, so you don't end up making the same thing again and again. All of my friends asked me for a copy of the recipe and I'm sure they'll love it too!

The creamy tomatoey sauce combined with the crunchiness and flavorfulness of the Mexicorn was a pleasant surprise. I have to say that I did not think that a medium onion was too much. Our family loves onions anyway. I only topped the casserole with 8 slices of cheese and it was enough for me. All in all it was a great dish and I would definitely make it again!",
