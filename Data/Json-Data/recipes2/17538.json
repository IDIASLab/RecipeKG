I made a half recipe but used 3 jalapenos and it was just way too spicy for me. After tasting the sauce before heating it I ended up throwing half of it away in order to fix it up and allow it to fit into my food processor. After making some changes it was awesome! I calculated what the changes would be to keep the original serving size and they would be to use half the amount of tomatoes use only 2 jalapenos double the amounts of walnuts sesame seeds raisins and chocolate use 3 T garlic and add in the veg. stock to desired consistency (i probably used 1/2 of suggested amount; it will thicken a little when cooking with main entree). I also made it with chicken legs and thighs.",
