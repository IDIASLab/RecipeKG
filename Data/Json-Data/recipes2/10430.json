Rather than tossing all the ingredients together I eliminated the iceberg lettuce from the mix and plated the salad on large beautiful butter lettuce leaves. Once my lobster was cooked shelled and chopped I realized I wouldn't have enough so I quickly boiled some frozen shrimp to compensate and it was a wonderful combination. I liked the warm lobster against the cool tomato and creamy avocado and the seafood seasoning blended with the butter proved to be a nice change from a typical salad dressing. This served with \"Cream of Tomato Soup with Pesto \" made for a delicious healthy and light but satisfying meal. On a side note I didn't use the feta because hubs doesn't like it and I had intended to substitute some crumbled bacon instead. It's only as I write this review that I realize I forgot the bacon and I know that would have been awesome good! Oh well next time...",
