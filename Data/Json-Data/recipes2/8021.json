I added more soy sauce (actually I used Braggs liquid aminos)and oil as some suggested-I doubled it but we still added more after cooking. I used peanut oil since I didn't have sesame oil and didn't bother grating the ginger I just minced it. Also I used foil instead of parchment. I cooked it a little longer (20 min) because the broccolli was still too crunchy for us. Oh and I used precooked shrimp. It didn't seem to matter at all; definately not over cooked.
