However I did enjoy this recipe overall and it made a healthy and filling lunch. The warm sweet potato melted the avocado a bit and turned some of it into a creamy dressing/sauce. Next time I will not use the garlic powder or perhaps only a tiny dash of it. I think something for a crunchy element would be a nice addition such as some roasted pecans or walnuts. A nice base recipe that will be great for some changes based on personal taste.",
