Nothing fancy here, just a tender, moist, pumpkin-y, delicious cake!  The spices are spot on, and don't even think about frosting it  because you don't need it.  And as a bonus, incredibly easy to make.  Just enjoy its natural simplicity.  Next time, I\u2019ll add some chopped walnuts or pecans for a variation, but this one\u2019s a keeper as is!",
