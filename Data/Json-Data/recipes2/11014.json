I also do not have chocolate soy milk on hand I used lactose free milk and homemade sugar free chocolate syrup to make chocolate milk and used that instead. My kids didn't say wether they liked it or not......they drank it but they weren't enthusastic about it. I'll make it again tomorrow and update my review when I get a definite like/dislike.",

I can taste each ingredient in every sip (except for the oatmeal and the chia seeds which only add texture and nutrition to the smoothie). I made the smoothie as written except my pineapple wasn't frozen. So I added a few ice cubes. If your pineapple is not very sweet that might throw the flavor off some and might require for you to add a sweetener (in which case I always use honey). Will make again.",
