After reading all the reviews here is what I did: Being that it is no longer thanksgiving and the reason I stumbled upon this recipe is because I was looking for a recipe for boneless skinless turkey breast I cubed about a pound of turkey breast and seasoned it with salt white pepper (because I'm out of black at the moment) sage and rosemary. I cooked it in waterless cookware on top the stove when almost done I added a small onion about a tsp of minced garlic fresh broccoli and about a tbsp of butter then let it simmer until onion and broccoli softened just a little. I cooked my rice according to directions but added a little salt a little rosemary and a little butter. Then I mixed turkey and broccoli mixture with rice and probably a little more than a cup of shredded Colby jack in 9x13 baking dish. After that I added one can cream of chicken soup to a small mixing bowl along with half the can filled with chicken broth and the other half filled with heavy cream. I whisked the ingredients together and poured over turkey rice and broccoli mixture. I melted the butter and mixed with crumbled crackers as directions stated only I didn't have wheat crackers so I used the oyster crackers I had left and some butter crackers I had in the cabinet. I baked it on 350 for closer to 30 min. Bon appetite!",

I used minute rice instead which cut down on time, added 2 cans cream of muchroom soup mixed with a little milk and a dash of worcestershire sauce, and a handful of diced onions.  I didnt put the broccoli in the casserole because my kids love broccoli and I wasnt sure if they would eat it all together.  I also used corn flakes instead of crackers because that was what was in my cupboard.  I dont usually change recipes this much but I used what I had and it turned out good.",
