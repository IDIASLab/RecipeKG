I made it to a T and I couldn't have asked for a better turn out. This made roughly 2 wide mouth pints of this deliciously sinful chocolately goodness. The bad thing is about this recipe...it's not going to last long;-) EXTREME happiness!!! TY",

I kept it simple and instead of using chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk I just used a prepared sauce with basically just both of those same ingredients. I then mixed in some caramel and flavored Kahlua. I scaled the recipe way down to see how it tasted. The Kahlua added just the right amount of extra flavor. I even made a really delicious one with butterscotch sauce and pumpkin spice kahlua mixed together yum! Great on top of whipped cream as a garnish or ice cream. ty",
