After thawing it was like mush but so what it's going in a smoothie. Cut off one end and it slid out like yogurt coming out of a tube so I used the whole banana. Eye-balled the rest of the ingredients so I may have used a touch more honey. And since my orange was so dry added a splash of raspberry-lemonade I made the day before. It was either that or grapefruit juice. Didn't have any other citrus except lemons. Had to use vanilla yogurt. A wonderful smoothie thoroughly enjoyed; suggest you try it. You won't be disappointed. Can't wait to make it again with fresh fruit. May even add a little more ginger. Thanks for the recipe.",
