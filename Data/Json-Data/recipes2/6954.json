This recipe was an experiment, and I was very surprised to find the flavor and aroma was very reminiscent of Thai ingredients such as red curry, coconut milk, and lemongrass. The pork will be juicy and flavorful with no need to marinate. Garnish with lime wedges. Enjoy!",

I didn't have chipotle and I don't like using canned food anyway so I diced a hot red pepper not sure what it was but it looks like jalape\u00f1o. I put this in a glass 9x13 pan with Yukon potatoes carrots tomatoes and onions on its sides. The result was juicy tender and tasty. It was late when I made it and I wasn't that hungry. I cut one of the tenderloins and left the other intact. My mom made tenderloin all the time and I see why because it was easy to make and quick could of been quicker but I like to take my time when cooking.",

I used 1 TBS of ground dried chipotle instead. And (2) I marinated the tenderloin in the honey sauce for 3 hours before baking it. I thought the sauce was intriguing and was anxious for it to really flavor the entire roast. It did and it was delicious! As stated in the recipe this roast was very tender and very flavorful. I used one fresh peach sliced but next time will use two as the peaches added such a nice flavor. My family loved this dish. It will be one of my two go-to pork tenderloin recipes from now on. Next time I will add that second peach and again marinate the roast for at least 3 hours. I'm also going to try sprinkling chopped fresh cilantro over the finished roast as it goes well with our red and green chiles.",
