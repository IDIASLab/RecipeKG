For my family, meat is so expensive we don't get beef often at all so when I splurged on some round steak, which even at one of the toughest cuts is still $7 a pound, I wanted to find a new recipe to try. I could have just cried that I didn't trust the reviews and used this.  I am pretty good at salvaging almost any cooking mistake but the vinegar had just ruined this for us.
