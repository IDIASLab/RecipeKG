I haven't seen them on the Japanese market so I just finely chopped onion to let it dissapear into the sauce with the added flavor. My husband and I loved the flavor of our angus tenderloin melt in your mouth good. However it is extremely rich (must be all that butter soaked into the mushrooms!). Next time I make this (and I will) I'm going to try half the butter half beef stock. Hopefully it will still be rich in flavor without all the extra calories and fat. Otherwise I'll keep the recipe as is. A very gourmet meal for a special occasion without a lot of fuss. Make sure you know how much each steak weighs mine was only 3.3 oz while my husband's was 8oz so I had to brown it for less time and took it out of the oven much sooner and was medium. My husband's was also medium to medium well with the listed cooking times. Oh yeah my two year old devoured the mushrooms so I'll make more next time just for her.",
