What the recipe doesnt mention is how big you cut the potatoes into cubes. about 1in to 1 1/2 in cubes. not too small because when you mix all ingredients together they might mash turning into mashed potatoes. Also my bf and I love bacon so sometimes I make more bacon then the recipe calls for. It does take some time to make but its worth it! We love this tasty cool summer salad.",

I don't ever use Miracle whip for anything but hubby likes it so I thought I'd give it a try. I used 1 bag of baby red potatoes so there wasn't that much there so I'm thinking maybe the submitter means to use a 5# bag of potatoes??? Because I had less potatoes I just eyeballed the ingredients to our liking...I used 4 hard boiled eggs chopped 12oz. cooked crumbled bacon about 1-1-1/2 cups Miracle Whip and about 1 cup of cheese. This was perfect for us. There just seemed to be too much bacon eggs and Miracle Whip for the amount of potatoes called for so as written (b/c the amount of potatoes is not clear) I would probably give this less stars. We enjoyed this and I honestly didn't think it was gonna be that good and was tempted to add some onion but I'm glad I didn't b/c it was yummy and didn't need anyything else. I would make this again! Sorry if I sound confusing but I don't know how else to say it lol. Thanks for sharing.:)",
