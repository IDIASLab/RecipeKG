Simmered uncovered for an hour instead of 10 minutes or so because my family prefers softer cauliflower, which also helped thicken.  Added salt as others suggested as well.  My grandparents always served curry with a variety of toppings, as desired, including plum jam, peanuts, sweet relish, coconut flakes.  I added peanuts & sweet relish as last-minute toppings to this.  So yummy.  This will be a regular for us.",

Used just a few potatoes, and added more chickpeas.  Increased the garlic and ginger by a bit.  If you have the time, fully cook dried chickpeas and use those, as the texture is much nicer (you can adjust to your preference). Use 2 cups cooked as a sub for the canned, or more if desired. I really liked the sriracha as an extra layer of flavor.",
