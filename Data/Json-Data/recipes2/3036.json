The one posted picture of this recipe is extremely misleading - with all that soy sauce in this recipe trust me those green beans do not look like THIS recipe - unless the submitter forgot the soy sauce or chose not to use it. These beans are an unattractive shade of greeny-brown. And they basically taste like... green beans and soy sauce. One of the rare occasions Hubs and I not only agreed on a review of a recipe but we did so immediately without hesitation. The other issue is that there is no way you'd want to use the overload of sesame seeds called for. I used fresh green beans which theoretically should have made these even better but unfortunately this was a real miss for us.",

The toasted sesame seeds at the end really are needed (not necessarily that much but 2-3 tbsp).
