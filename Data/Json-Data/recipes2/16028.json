I substituted one fresh ear of cut corn and about 1 cup of cooked diced carrots that I had left over. I cooked the corn in the oil for about 3 minutes and then added peas until just wilted and carrots last until heated thru. I didn't have Teraki sauce so I used 1 generous tablespoon of soy. Seasame seeds added a nice touch. I think the recipe can easily stand as given my changes were just necessary due to my pantry. Great versatile recipe Bonnie. Thanks for sharing.",
