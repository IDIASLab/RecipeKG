I have had to defrost for up to 2 minutes then heat for 45 seconds and then have to heat the egg an additional 25 seconds for it to even be warm. A lot of work to heat it up but the taste is good. The tricky part is getting the whole sandwich warm without melting away all the cheese or causing the english muffin to become hard. Good luck!",

They have less fat and are a little more sturdy than the croissant. I bake half the amount of egg in an 11 X 7 pan and add omelet style veggies (diced onion bell pepper diced green chiles). I use eggbeaters. A thin slice of Canadian bacon is a nice substitute for ham slices & use 2% sliced cheese. I wrap them individually and put them in a gallon zippered storage bag to keep the freezer burn away. Take one out and let it thaw in the frig overnite. In the morning they heat a little more evenly that way.",

Seasoning the eggs wouldn't hurt either! My oven runs very hot so add minutes if you oven bake the eggs!  Most say oven bake the eggs for approx 20 minutes!  Wrap in parchment or wax paper then slid into a ziplock freezer bag! \n\nThaw sandwich OVER NIGHT will help when reheating! \n\nMicrowaves are different, some people may need to defrost the sandwich prior to heating for 1-2 minutes.\n\n\nFor some people you may need to defrost the meat and bun first then gently defrost and heat the egg separate but this process does not take much time. Much less time than making them fresh.",

The real reason for my review is that you really need to play with your microwave to figure out if this works for you. This recipe does not work in my microwave oven. I can adjust and do the eggs on half power without the bread and put the cheese on later but that doesn't work with my morning - I need something that I can nuke and go. so I have a freezer full of these which I have been taking out on Satursday mornings dissasembling heating and eating. Every microwave oven is different so that's not anything against this recipe just a little dissapointing:(",
