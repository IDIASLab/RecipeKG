I made this using vanilla pudding mix exactly as the original recipe is written.  I then used it with the Heavenly White Cake recipe here topped off with fresh strawberries (dry them after washing).  I used it as a filling between layers of the cake, then frosted the outside of the cake, and piped little flowers all around the strawberries.  I was surprised how nicely the delicate piped flowers turned out.  The frosting holds up well at room temperature.  I decorated the cake and had it on display for 2 and a half hours with no change in it's appearance or texture.  I also piped this frosting on cupcakes for my son's kindergarten birthday party.  The children sucked the frosting right off the cupcakes and they declared it tasted like vanilla ice cream.  It was a hit with everyone!",

I made cupcakes for my granddaughters birthday.Seven hours later they still looked great.She only likes whipped cream frosting and she really liked it.I normally don't like whipped cream frosting and I liked it along with everyone else.I did freeze the bowl and whisk first.I whipped it a longer than the recipe called for. I ended up with stiff peaks. after folding in the Cool Whip it got lumpy.turned the mixer back on whipped it about fifteen seconds more. Perfect.I will be using this recipe a lot. I also will be trying other flavors of pudding.Thanks Sweettreats",

I made it exactly as written but with a chocolate pudding mix instead of a vanilla for a cake on Mother's day. It's so simple and easy to make and takes no time at all. It is not overly sweet either just right! I have a chocolate cake in the oven right now for Father's day and I'm thinking of making it with the white chocolate pudding mix. I'm thinking of all of the wonderful flavors that can be made: lemon pudding for a lemon frosting on a lemon cake and even pistachio pudding - that would probably go good with a chocolate cake. There's also coconut cream banana cream butterscotch and even in the fall there's pumpkin spice... the possibilities are endless! Thank you so much for this recipe!",
