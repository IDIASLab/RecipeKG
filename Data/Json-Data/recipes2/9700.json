They are delicious and pretty, not to mention simple to make.  Everyone hears about sugar plums at Christmas, but nobody knows what they are! Kids LOVE these. Be sure to remove the whole clove before giving to small children however.",

However I made 1 inch balls and that was a lot more then 30. I wonder if the cloves are even neccessary so I decided to leave them overnight and see how that effects the taste. As is without the cloves the children went CrAzY for them. I will likely make them again but try another flavor like orange for variety.",

After making the balls and rolling them I had my doubts about what they would be like because it looked like kitty poop lol but after letting them stand for a couple hours they were firm enough to pick up and were really tasty. I did have to add another 1/4 cup of graham cracker crumbs to get it to hold together but this is definitely going into my recipe box. Next time we'll make them with orange Jell-O and add a touch of nutmeg. Thanks for the great recipe! More people should try this recipe out:)",
