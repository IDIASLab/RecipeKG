I love barley and the thought of having them together intrigued me.  A friend gave a bag of lentils to me and I found this recipe.  When I read it, it seemed too simple to be good.  However I read the reviews and saw most people didn\u2019t change much.  I didn\u2019t have any porcini mushrooms but I had a ton of sliced button mushrooms so I saut\u00e9ed them in a little olive oil and put them in the soup.    I added a parsnip and a couple potatoes to make it heartier.  To my dismay I did not have sherry on hand so I added a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar which added a full bodied richness.   With a warm loaf of bread and a glass of good wine, this soup was a great comfort food on a cold winter night.  Thank you Diana for sharing!!!",

So, I used 3 qts. which made a good, thick, hearty soup. That was as much room as I had in my pot. Next time, I'll use a large pot, and 4 qts. of veggie broth, and I'm sure that will be perfect!",
