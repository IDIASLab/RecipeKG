Well unless you are talented like Andy Warhol you might find the decorating a little more challenging than you would think at first. I know I did. The decorations on my hats looked like the witch had been flying in the wind at a high rate of speed. The hats really had the \"wind blown\" look. But I still adored them. Made them for my three little nephews (ages 8 6 and 4). They loved them. I will make them again keeping in mind that decorating takes a bit more effort and time than it looks like it would. I used the honey to secure the point of the hat. It doesn't take but just a dab. I put the honey on one chocolate kiss and pressed another chocolate kiss against the first one rubbed them together. This made \"glue\" application very easy and fast. No \"glue\" squished out at the bottom when applied to the hat. As far as the taste nothing exceptional. But after all this is not Gourmet Cookie Making 101. It is just shortbread cookies dipped in fudge with a chocolate kiss on the top. Worth the effort for a special holiday treat for your loved ones.",
