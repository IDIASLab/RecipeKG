I would have preferred the turkey bacon but I didn't have any on hand and decided to make this last minute. I LOVED the additional of the dry ranch and I loved the fact that no milk was needed. Swanson broth has such a rich flavor that I didn't even miss the butter either. Thanks for a great recipe Missy!",

On my second go I decided to make it similar to one of my other favorites with not peeling the potatoes and it was perfect either way. I think my kids liked the skins in it version a little more but both are perfect and are now a family favorite. Even my most picky eater loves the potatoes and wants them all the time. We prefer with Salisbury steaks or our Brown sugar meatloaf. Enjoy!",
