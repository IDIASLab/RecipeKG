However, we had some left over and I used it for sandwiches the next day with good rolls, pickled veggies, and spicy mayo. They were outstanding. My regular grocery does carry gochugaro, but it was about three times as expensive as the Asian market. If you have an Asian market in your area, try them out. Big variety and big savings.",
