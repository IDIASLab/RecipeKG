I wore non powder, non latex gloves to mix because I squished everything together really well and this way the sticky stuff didn't get under my nails or in my rings.  I've already added hemp seed and some coconut as well. I also run the dark chocolate chips through the food processor to make them even smaller. If you soak the Chia seeds in 1/4 cup of water for a little bit, they start to develop into a gel and I think acts as another binder. Initially these are expensive to make when you buy everything at once but in the long run, I'm sure it's cheaper than buying granola bars for the kids' lunch and WAY HEALTHIER. I still have to find out if they are freezable. I added the picture of my quadruple recipe.  It filled a sheet pan with 68 balls.",
