I tried the Pita Pockets recipe one day thinking \"maybe this will be interesting\" and to say it exceeded my expectations would be the understatement of the year. I went a step further splurging on McDonalds Nuggets rather than their illegitimate frozen counsins. This decision proved to be an act of culinary genius. My Pita Parcels were quite simply the best chow I've had since my recent release from the Adult Correctional Institution (the only possible exception being the first tuesday of every month which was celebrated with the most mouth-watering Salsbury Steak you'll ever eat).",

I didn't have chicken nuggets so I used a couple chicken breasts cubed and fried in a chicken broth & butter mix and then seasoned w/ paprika and a DASH of all season salt. I used \"Garlic & Herb\" pitas ommited the corn relish - none available and sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese over the top. Maybe the nuggets are the secret ingrediant but overall my \"version\" was only so-so. Not bad (everyone ate their pita) but noone was providing any huge compliments either.",
