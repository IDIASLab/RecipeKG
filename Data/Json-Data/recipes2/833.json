This is down home using what you have (bacon could sub) cooking. if you follow the cook on YouTube he mentioned she was a depression Era cook and honestly I made this exactly as is and it was good! As expected this doesn't hold up well because the penne gets soggy but you could always cook half the pasta add in and the other half separate and add in as you microwave or reheat!
