I coated chicken breasts in lemon pepper and then basted with BBQ sauce.

I didnt have boneless chicken so I just used my chicken legs and it was wonderful. Thank you so much for a great recipe. This ones a keeper!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I think the BBQ sauce you use is going to play a huge part in this recipe... I used a homemade sauce (Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce from this site) w/ excellent results.
