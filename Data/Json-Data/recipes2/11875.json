I really enjoy reading all the ways people make a certain recipe their own and I feel if a reviewer wants to give the original recipe 5 stars then that's just fine. So...I really wanted to make this but didn't have the exact ingredients.  I am putting my changes in this review so people can see there is a lot of latitude in making this and it still turns out great.  First I cut the recipe in half as I made it mostly for my 8 y/o.  Only had about a half pound of ground beef which I browned with a few additional spices. I used rigatoni noodles.  I didn't have a small can of tomato sauce so added some tomato paste to the browning meat. I left out the mushrooms. The rest of the recipe I followed but I kept a bit of the pasta water before draining to add back to the pasta before adding the sauce.  It helps the sauce incorporate with the pasta (according to Rachael Ray :) ).  My son's verdict was  that it tasted just like real pizza. I am sure I will try this again with different pizza topping ingredients.  The title really says it all...KID'S favorite pizza casserole.  Thanks for the inspiration!",

I always cook my meat with water in it and lots of spices (Garlic Mrs. Dash) so I just added the macaroni noodles and cooked both at the same time. We like supreme pizza with loads of veggies so I sauteed a large red onion one large green pepper a couple of stalks of celery and two cartons of mushrooms and several cloves of garlic in some EVOO. Before I put any of the veggies in the pan I added fennel and the garlic to the oil just to flavor it. When all was done I combined placed in glass casserole dish and baked as directed. Served up with a nice salad and garlic knots! My 8 year old son said it was amazing and actually wanted to take some for lunch. My 16 year old daughter said it was \"BOMB!\" Easy on the wallet easy prepping and absolutely delish!",
