First, it was mushy and gushy\u2026and I used only part of the juices in the can. My suggestion? Eliminate it altogether.  With the exception of the celery, this was waaaaay too \u201cgreen\u201d\u2026 and I used probably less than half of the parsley, dill and green onion called for. (Curiously, chives were mentioned in the recipe\u2019s description but green onion called for in the ingredients) The yogurt added nothing positive in my judgment and, since a bunch of canned tuna liquid is already included, only served to make this even gushier. The immense amount of parsley, green onion and dill overtook the tuna altogether, not only in taste but in sheer volume \u2013 one almost had to hunt and peck to find the specks of tuna before I added another can to adjust. The Dijon mustard was a nice idea, but there wasn\u2019t enough \u2013 again, it was clouded over by the \u201cgreen.\u201d One would have thought this would have been packed with flavor, but instead it was lacking.  A little pepper helped but was a trivial correction.   Finally, because of all the green stuff it was just plain unattractive \u2013 it does not make you want to dig in.",
