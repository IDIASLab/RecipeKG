However we gently added the grenadine to the white punch and as it settled to the bottom of the punch bowl and with the clouds of ice cream on top the sunset effect was indescribably beautiful!! Next time I'd add some club soda or something to dilute the sweetness a bit. Also we used MUCH more then 1/2 cup of icecream and that was really good!! Also I like the frozen cherry idea that another reviewer had as thawed marachino cherries sink right to the bottom of the bowl.",
