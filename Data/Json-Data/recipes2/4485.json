I did add one more tablespoon of the apple butter I was kind of confused as to why there was only one tablespoon in the whole recipe and why it was there until I figured out that it must be replacing the fat that would normally be in a pancake recipe. I served these with homemade maple-vanilla pancake syrup. These pancakes cooked up nice and fluffy and were the perfect consistancy it's just that the ginger was a little too much for us. I don't want to downrate the recipe because I know that the submitter meant for the pancakes to be that way it was just a little too much for us. I will make these again only I would cut back on the ginger some.",
