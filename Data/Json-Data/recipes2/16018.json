We used ground turkey instead of ground beef. Plus at the last minute we noticed that we were out of onions! So we just nixed that ingredient. Everything turned out great nevertheless. We did spice things up with salt pepper and garlic powder. I can see how this might be a bit bland otherwise. But overall a nice piece of comfort food perfect for a chilly autumn night!",
