I added finely chopped celery a good amount of chopped fresh basil balsamic vinegar olive oil and about 2 tbl of a Lite Italian Dressing and a heavy sprinkling of a No Salt Seasoning. This is tasting very good now. I felt it was too bland before and too much of the papaya flavor came thru. Papaya is ok until the after taste hits. Ick. I am trying now to remember why I bought the ugly thing in the first place. But I thank the submitter for sharing and allrecipes.com for posting it.This salad turned out great with my additions.",
