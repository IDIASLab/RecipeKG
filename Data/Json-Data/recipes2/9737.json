                "reviewBody": "The end product was very good. The recipe needs some editing... I was unable to find a 20 oz package of the Galletas Marias so based on the recipe I bought four 6 oz packages. I have two entire packages left. I used 12 oz of cookies exactly. The other issue I had was making several layers in a 9x13 inch dish with one 15 oz can of fruit cocktail. I used a rectangular Rubbermaid container which I believe is a bit smaller than the one called for and a single 14.5 oz can of fruit cocktail only made a single layer. I ended up using four cans of fruit cocktail using one can for each layer. I also sliced my peaches in half to get them to sort of cover the top - leaving open spaces between. You could easily use 2-3 cans of peaches. After making 5 layers of the dipped cookies I had just a few tablespoonfuls of the sauce left which I drizzled over the top layer before puting the peaches on top. Everyone who tried this complimented me on it (=",

                "reviewBody": "I just love this cookie cake, the texture is very soft,  I used 2 cans of fruit , I didn't put a lot  of fruit between the layers,  I also used strawberries instead of the canned peaches,  since they are on season and very delicious,  I drizzled the strawberries with some melted nutella just to make it look more delicious than already is. My tip  to make it faster is ,   don't dip every cookie in the mixture it will take a long time,  first put a layer of  the creamy sauce then a layer of cookies,  then some fruit , then again the sauce , cookies,  fruit until you are done, try to finish with a layer of Marias cookies, that way is easier to decorate.",
