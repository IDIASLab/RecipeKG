I snuck in a few shakes of a garlic/pepper blend too. Yum. It is one of my grandbaby's favorite after school snacks. I am gathering a collection of the recipes she loves.

I popped white popcorn in my microwave popcorn popper and then drizzled unsalted butter over the top and added 1/4 t. of garlic salt 1/4 t. of garlic powder freshly grated Parmesan cheese and several sprinkles of rosemary. It does taste very similar to garlic bread. In fact I had an urge to to drizzle it with marinara sauce. Thanks Pixie009 for sharing your recipe. I am just set in my ways when it comes to the way I want to eat popcorn. Give me buttered and lightly salted and I am good to go:)",
