I used unbleached organic white flour instead of whole wheat flour. And organic cane sugar for palm sugar. I also chose to omit the cinnamon in the dough out of preference. Rolled the dough balls in the cinnamon sugar mix and baked for 8 minutes. These turned out as close to my grandma s recipe as possible without the butter. These are going into our cookie rotation for sure. Thank you for the fine recipe.",
