The chili is perfectly spiced and you can just feel the heat at the back of your mouth with the first bite. This recipe does make a really thin chili but if you used tomato sauce instead of juice or if you add a mixture of 2 tablespoons cornstarch with 1/4 cup warm water it thickens up nicely. I really can't say enough about how wonderful this chili is. Thanks a bunch!",
