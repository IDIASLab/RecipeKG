However I didn't like the bold taste of the vanilla for such a small amount of cookie dough but understand it's to mask the taste of the chickpeas but I think the peanut better does a good job at that. I'd make again but use less vanilla(1/2 tsp should be way plenty) & a peanut butter \"lower\" in oil because these are extremely oily. Best tip I can also offer is pulse and blend your cooked chick peas 1st before adding the peanut butter agave nectar & vanilla...the peas are rather chunky and do not break up well with the other ingredients. These can be a quick fix for that cookie dough need. And kept in the frig a few days.",

I'd suggest you let it sit overnight before you start snacking on it; the flavors need some time to meld together. The second day and beyond, the garbanzo bean flavor is hardly noticeable at all. I also tried this with almond butter, which is good but gives the dough a stickier consistency. My blender nearly burned itself out as I was making this recipe; perhaps a heavy-duty one will do the job just fine, but from now on I'm using a fork and my hands.",
