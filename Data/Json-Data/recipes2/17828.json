The cream cheese filling amount needs to be decreased and it should be slightly sweetened. The original amount made it soggy and almost impossible to slice into individual rolls. The sweetness of the frosting is not enough since you are adding it to the warm roll the runs right off. I would not try this again.",

People, add white or brown sugar to this and mix it with the cinnamon. I forgot about the cream cheese. I brushed the rolled out dough with butter and sprinkled it with cinny/ sugar. Rolled em up, baked and spread with cream cheese frosting. I had 4 Young adults in the house, they Devored these rolls in record time!! I will make these again for sure \nThank you Klutz!! Excellent recipe who needs more attention AND Redo then it is actually getting.",
