Instead of black beans I think garbanzo beans would be a complementary flavor. I don't know where the \"spicy\" comes in as it's not spicy but it is very good.",

Things I would do differently - - - less pasta or more veggies LOTS more dressing sliced black olives not chopped (they clung together) and no black beans.
