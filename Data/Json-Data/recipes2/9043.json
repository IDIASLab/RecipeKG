I had to do a couple of changes i could not find my waffle iron so i made pancakes instead and they had a nice crust(probably due to the corn meal) and nice and soft inside. I used coconut milk because i don't care for soy milk and i used gluten free oats and white rice flour.I did add some maple syrup to them. Very nice change from the regular waffle(pancake) breakfast.Thank you sueb for this recipe. It is a keeper..",
