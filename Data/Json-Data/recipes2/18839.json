I liked the idea of using pepperoni, but the consistency didn't lend itself to making individual balls.  That would have been a huge waste of time.  It's possible to make it into one large ball or log, but again, it's lacking something in the consistency so this recipe, as is, would be best used as a bowl dip.  I think I would eliminate most or all of the sour cream and butter and maybe try putting some dry Ranch mix or something similar in.\nEDIT:  To be fair, after this was left in the refrigerator overnight, the consistency and taste were much, much better.  You could probably roll it into individual balls, but spreading it on crackers is just fine.",
