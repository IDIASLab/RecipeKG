The overall taste is very concentrated and flavorful and these would be excellent served with steak and a glass of red wine.  A perfect balance of flavors between the vinegar, beef bouillon and ricotta. You would never know by looking at them that there is ricotta (the amount is minimal), but it does add a slight hint of creaminess. I might even add more next time.  I think a nice sprinkle of minced fresh parsley would be a nice addition for eye-appeal.",
