I made this for the opposite reason Chef John intended: I had some leftover homemade ricotta that needed to be used up! Since I didn't have turkey leftovers on hand I used meat from a store bought rotisserie chicken. The only other change to the recipe I made was that I used a mixed Italian seasonings blend rather than marjoram as I didn't have any on hand. I was really impressed by how much the crepes mimicked pasta in this dish. I almost couldn't tell this difference. And these are much easier to fill than the traditional manicotti shells (though truth be told I always cheated when using those but slitting them open after I boiled them and before rolling them up around the filling). I will definitely make this again!",

I doubled Chef John's filling recipe but substituted oregano for the marjoram and romano cheese instead of parmesan. I did double the filling recipe since I cooked the entire box of shells and had enough filling for 30 (there were 38 shells in the box). This is a great way to use 2 cups of leftover turkey but I think the stuffed shells need more than 1-1/2 cups of sauce I used more than 2 cups. They're yummy by the way:) Thanks Chef John:)",
