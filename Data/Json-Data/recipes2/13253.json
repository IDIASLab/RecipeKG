The trick with this dish is keeping the noodles separated while mixing them with the cheese mixture. I used silicone tongs to manually separate the noodles while stirring. Reading the title I expected a lighter dish. This is a rich and cheesy lasagne that will satisfy you. It went nicely with a light salad. Thank you for the recipe.",
