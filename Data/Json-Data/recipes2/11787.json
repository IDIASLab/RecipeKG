I pounded out my chicken breasts and made them nice and thin which cut the baking time down by half.

I am cleaning out my freezer fridge and pantry for an upcoming move and this was a great choice for today's dinner. Normally I would make mine with a homemade sauce but for what this is it is great! I try to keep a jar or 2 of Ragu in my pantry for times when I don't have any of my own in the freezer. I will make this again.",
