There seems to be a lot of super rated recipes that have one or two bad reviews and it always is to the extreme. I appreciate honest reviews, but perhaps if one person's attempt fails, make an accurate account of what may have happened rather than blame the recipe or make comments on how you went about disposing of the evidence.",

For a busy mother of two on a tight schedule, this receipe is WONDERFUL!!! You do need to be careful on your ingredient choices though.  1) Half-and Half takes FOREVER to thicken.  I use heavy cream and cut the amount in 1/2.  2) Fake shaker style parm will separate. It's a bit more expensive, but look for the real grated or shaved parmesan... your results will be much much better.  3) Temperature is everything with this dish. If you have the temp too high when making your sauce it will separate or not thicken properly..  Be patient!!  Otherwise a wonderful dish that the family loves! (I also added a bit of garlic to the onion ham mixture for taste.)",
