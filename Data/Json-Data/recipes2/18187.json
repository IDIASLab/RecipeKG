I made regular grilled cheese for my 3 year old and for hubby and myself I tried this! It was so tasty! Only changes were I used American cheese instead of cheddar and drizzled a little bit of Good Seasons Italian Dressing on top of the feta/onion/tomato before topping with more American cheese. EXTREMELY tasty and quick to make!! Thanks for the idea!!",
