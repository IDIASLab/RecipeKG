The only mistake I made was going upscale on the wiener using a Boar s Head wiener with a natural casing it s a little hard to bite into and tends to pull it apart. Should have stuck with a simple Oscar Mayer wiener which would have made this really good instead of just pretty good. I would best describe this as a dessert with a little meat.

He tried to get me to take a bite but the smell of the processed cheese squirt made my stomach gurgle in a very unpleasant way. While slicing the twinkie in half to make a bun for the weiner is the traditional manner of making these I think cutting the the weiner and twinkies into bite size pieces and skewering them on a bamboo stick (twinkie wiener kebab anyone?) could really uplevel this treat. You could plan a fun UHF party around these also add in a wheel of fish (sushi rice krispie treats) flying poodle cookies ghandi's steak bites (pioneer woman has a recipe) mashed potato mountains Yappy's dog treats etc. the appetizer options are freaking limitless! Thanks again for the recipe!",
