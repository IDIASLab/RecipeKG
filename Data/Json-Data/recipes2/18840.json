I had a medley of bell peppers on hand, so I used a mixture of orange, red, yellow and green peppers which really lent the dish a lot of color. No need to measure ingredients exactly, just add or subtract to suit your own taste. Also, in keeping with the fresh flavors I was after in this dish, I opted to use fresh, chopped tomatoes rather than canned.  Simply beautiful dish with a delicious blend of flavors.",

Gave it 4 stars due to some tweaking.... the recipe doesn't state when to add the tomoatoes - not a big deal just throw them in when you add your peppers.

While the taste of this was allright (nothing special, but edible), it was the texture that snubbed me. The broth / wine mixture, when combined with a thickener and then added to warm ingredients, made for a wierd \"gooey\" sauce. I have no aversion to creamy sauces, but broth / wine are an odd pairing for a pasta sauce. Perhaps I had my burner set too high???? Also, as this recipe implies, I was expecting an Italian stir-fry meal. I should have known better.... Sauteeing veggies for 5 minutes and then simmering for another 10 minutes will undoubtedly turn them to mush (especially onions). I think this would have been MUCH better if my veggies were crisp-tender (like a traditional stir-fry should be). Served with Italian bread, this was an \"OK\" meal. My hubby liked this a bit more than I did, so I guess it wasn't a complete loss lol! Anywhoo, I hope this will float your boat cause it sure didn't mine :( Thanks anyways, JBLUVS2COOK!",
