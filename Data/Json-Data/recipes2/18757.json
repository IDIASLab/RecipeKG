What I found is this is a very fresh and light flavor dish so yes I can see how many of the people reviewing it said it seemed to be missing somthing. Here are the modifications I made and still remained true to the recipe: 6 slices of bacon completly cooked and crumbled 1/2 cup-ish of rind-free Brie (extra is good) 2 tbsp lemon juice 2 tbsp italian seasoning 1/2 bag of Organic frozen spinich (yes organic has more flavor) I cooked and drained the pasta then returned it to the pan. I added the spinich and brie stirred it then cover to let the hot pasta melt the brie and thaw the spinich. Turn the burner on low add the garlic bacon lemon juice and itlian seasoning and a few tablespoons of water so it doesnt burn. Mix occasionally and keep stiring until all ingredients are well mixed. Dice a fresh tomato and sprinkle on just before serving. Hope this helps you! Oh and make sure you eat this right away it doesnt reheat well.",

I found it to be very bland. We love brie - so I was excited about using it in a pasta dish having never done so. But it quickly melted down once added and there was really no trace of it that could be tasted on the linguine. The only indication of it was the little pieces of skin which was just sort of strange. I love all of the individual ingredients - but this is missing something. Perhaps more of a pesto instead of plain olive oil - and small chunks of brie sprinkled on top of each serving instead of mixing it in.",
