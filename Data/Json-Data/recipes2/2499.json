If times ever get tough, I could survive for hours, maybe days on them; but since things are going pretty well, I decided to dust off a can, and show you my version of Sicily's famous pasta con le sarde.

The pine nuts, raisins, flavorful sardines and the fennel with a little bit of heat is so good. I really love it. I have made it several times with different white wines and sardine brands. I prefer using a Chablis and Kroger brand sardines (boneless/skinless). I almost always make it with-out the breadcrumbs. I either forget or just plain old don't want to make the extra effort! Either way it's  fabulous. This dish and I have converted many onto the beauty of canned sardines. Thanks, Chef John!",

Made only half the recipe with generous amounts of bread crumbs and pine nuts and no saffron.  Other than that, I followed exactly and it was so worth it!  I think it helped to have all the ingredients in place. I made the bread crumbs while pulling everything else together, and then cleaned through the canned sardines while the onions/fennel cooked.  The textures and flavors had incredible depth.  The taste reminded me of the beach!",

I've gone back to the other recipes to try and figure out where this one falls short.  The first thing I noticed is that the others use red onions, not white. The second is that because the fennel and onions cook at different rates, the best recipes cook them separately to avoid the onions browning before the fennel. Then they mix them together once cooked. Then there the proportions. I would double the fennel and the garlic. Add a good handful of chopped parsley. Use more anchovy. The sardines are very important.  Use a high quality brand packed with olive oil. And, lastly, I don't think bucatini are correct for this dish. I'd use spaghetti. They are thinner and absorb the flavors more evenly.",

I bought the slightly more expensive ( 2.50 instead of 99c) sardines in olive oil which turned out to be smaller they had tony bones so they didn't need to be cleaned and they didn't smell at all (unlike the stink of the 99c ones -which I'm totally used to-). I almost slipped the breadcrumbs for panko but I'm glad I didn't. They were great. I had saffron in the house so this dish was super cheap to make too which I really love.",
