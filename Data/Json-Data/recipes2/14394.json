I used fresh oregano and basil, doubled the amount of tomato, and added MUCH more white wine than the original recipe called for (I used at least 1/2 cup of  the wine as the base for the sauce, as others said it was dry).  I also added a little bit of salt to the sauce.  Instead of just shrimp, I used a seafood mix of shrimp, scallops, and squid and tossed it all with spinach linguini.  Definitely a keeper!",

(I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the pasta to sauce ratio is a bit off; you don't need to use 16 oz. of pasta; just use about 2/3 of that.) I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes rather than fresh, added a few pinches of crushed red pepper and a splash or two of half & half at the end. Oh my goodness! What an awesome recipe! My husband and I both had seconds and there's still some left for my lunch tomorrow. I'd been looking for something new to do with shrimp and now I will look no further! Thanks so much for a terrific recipe!!!",
