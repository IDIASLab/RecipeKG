                "reviewBody": "What a great tasting and healthy snack!! Thanks Chef John!! I used one can of garbanzo beans instead of soaking dried beans. I drained and rinsed the beans thoroughly. I then laid them on paper towel to absorb some leftover water. I placed the beans in a small bowl because I find that easier when combining ingredients. I used one tablespoon of olive oil and one teaspoon of a new spice I just purchased in my grocery store, called Sriracha  Seasoning. It is a DRIED spice I found on the grocery shelf right next to all the other dried spices. If you're a fan of sriracha chili sauce then you will just love this new dried seasoning. I also sprinkled a little sea salt and pepper on the beans. I gave it a good mixing and then poured the mixture on a baking dish treated with non-stick cooking spray. I baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then stirred as directed. Since they looked almost done, I placed them back in the oven for 10 minutes more. They came out perfect with a total of 30 minutes cooking time. Spicy and delicious!",

You can even roast in a skillet them with a little brown sugar and cinnamon to get something similar to the candied pecans they sell in tourist destinations.  If you like the chickpeas a little saltier, try soaking them in heavily salted water.  Then use just a little salt when seasoning them.  This helps to get the seasoning all the way through the bean instead of just the coating.",

When hot and fresh out of the oven the lighter ones were soft and squashy the darker ones nice and crunchy. But when cool the lighter ones are nice and crunchy and the darker ones are burnt. So lesson learnt. I'll probably make them again because the recipe is cheap easy and unusual. And they will probably turn out better the next time!",

Following the advice of other reviewers I placed the chickpeas in a gallon ziplock bag and added 1/4 cup of olive oil. I spread the chickpeas in a single layer on parchment paper lined cookie sheets with sides. Then I liberally applied Sriracha seasoning (Weber s Sriracha Rub) in place of the spices. I didn t try to stir the chickpeas nor coat them evenly. As the recipe directed I pulled the pan from the oven at 20 minute intervals. I used a pancake turner to flip the chickpeas and sampled a few chickpeas for texture and to see what adjustments I need to make. I broadcast sea salt over them and returned them to the oven. I m pleased with how this recipe turned out. They are crispy on the outside soft inside and flavorful. I m making it for a hostess gift.",
