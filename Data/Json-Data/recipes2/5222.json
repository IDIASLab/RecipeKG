I did make a change by adding some chopped onion and had no white cheddar, so used mild yellow cheddar. Followed the video instructions and had no trouble incorporating the eggs. I did let the mixed ingredients sit overnight in the fridge and, after forming the balls, I put them in the freezer to set up better for deep frying. This will allow me to keep them on hand too, for those times you just have to have an emergency popper puff!",

                "reviewBody": "I have made numerous Chef John recipes that turned out to be fantastic. Unfortunately this was the one I was unhappy with.\nThe flavor of the poppers themselves were good. I made these for a work party and I received nothing but compliments.\nHowever, I thought the dipping sauce could have been more flavorful. I added some extra seasoning of my own, but I think the poppers are fine without the effort of the dip.\nI was frustrated with the number of poppers this made. The recipe states it makes 8 servings, but doesn't specify what a serving is. I ended up with 15, which isn't bad, but...\n...I was further agitated because after making everything as directed, which was very labor intensive and took significantly longer than I expected, the first 4 I fried were immediately burnt, despite heating the oil to the instructed temp. I ended up letting the oil get down to about 325 for the remainder of the poppers which turned out great, but I still had 4 wasted.\nSo after a long time I ended up with just 11 that I could take to my coworkers. Again, the flavor was good, but for 11 it was just not worth the effort. If I make these again I'll be prepared to double the recipe, not get the oil so hot, and either leave the dip or just buy pre-made from the store.",
