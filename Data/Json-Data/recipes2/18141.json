In lieu of 3 of the ingredients I subbed Wampler's bulk turkey sausage Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup and light soy sauce. I did use regular French's French fried onions though. For these 4 ingredients the sodium content per portion is 886 mg. (a bit less). I doubled the garlic added a few drops of red hot pepper sauce and used French cut green beans. I would make 2 more changes next time: sub unsalted chopped nuts for the fatty fried onions (it needs some crunch) and also add some sliced fresh mushrooms. Then it would be a 5 star recipe!! Do try this--it is GOOD.",
