Scaled the recipe down to 2 servings and in this house it really was 3 (that s OK lunch tomorrow). Loved the way the cheese melted almost immediately into the rice which only took 90 seconds to cook in the micro...thanks Uncle Ben s! Followed the recipe to the letter except we did give this a good shake of hot sauce at the table (personal taste preference). Just let the frozen peas defrost and then stir them into the hot rice (save one pot to wash). I could see if you wanted to change this up a bit substitute hot pepper cheese for the cheddar to kick it up a bit. Liz Dalton thanks for the new recipe we enjoyed it.",

Everything that was leftover had steeped overnight so right there is a win...then caramelizing the hot dogs in the frying pan added just the right saltiness and meatiness to balance the starchiness of the rice and peas...the beans added the needed sweetness...the cheese was the cherry on the top!  It all came together to form a great casserole that my sweet hubby went back  for seconds!! Okay, okay...I went back for seconds too...bottom line...this is a winner!!",
