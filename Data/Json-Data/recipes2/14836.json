I altered it a bit by sauteing the garlic onion and pepper first then adding the ground turkey (rather than vice versa). Also added salt parsley and a little basil to the mix before adding the soup and sauce. I also opted out of the canned spaghetti/sauce and simply cooked spaghetti and sauce separately and then added them to turkey mixture along with some parmesan and mozzarella cheese. It's definitely not a dinner party dish but works for a family meal.",
