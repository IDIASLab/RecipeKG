Finally, I gave this 4 stars and not 5 because of the cheese selection.  The author is lucky to have such a variety available in his area, and I will look for it.

The video was helpful. I do not have access to a mixer, so my dough was done by hand.  Also, I am somewhere with limited cheese stocks, so I used fresh mozarella.  That being said, this came together very easily and worth the minor work.  Nice flavor and a nice Saturday night repast with a glass of red.\n\nIn the future, the thinner the dough, the better.  Patience and perhaps a warmer time of year, as the dough is more elastic with warmth.  I am already planning for different flavor combos in future uses of this recipe.  But, overall it is a good base recipe.  If you do not have a half sheet, a small cookie sheet should work.",
