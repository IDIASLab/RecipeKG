I put it in a little food processor and it worked great! It took like 5 minutes and it looked like a gourmet spread because of the beautiful colors from the red onion and parsley. I also used a baguette and sliced them real thin. I spread the topping on the bread about an hour before the party and then when people got there threw them in the oven for about 15 minnutes until they were golden brown. They smelled delicious and were delicious even when they weren't hot anymore!",
