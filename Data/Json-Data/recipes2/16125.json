Everything just kind of stood there and I had to use a spoon to shuffle the contents then I had to add more milk (about 1/2 cup?) just to get things moving on a consistent basis. Last there were 2-3 large chunks of ice leftover in the shake and I had the blender on the next to highest speed. Taste was finally ok but would probably leave out about 1/2 the chocolate syrup. For me just too much modification to the recipe for it to be complete and work in the blender.",

Also it turns out very good but the ice might not blend as well and might make it a bit chunky but the good thing is ice is water so it can melt!
