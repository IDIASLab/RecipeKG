Incidentally I scrubbed the potatoes rubbed them in EVOO sprinked them w/ sea salt and baked at 400 for 45-50 min. b/c we LOVE to eat our potato skins crispy w/ Texas Pete hot sauce!",

I omitted the jalapenos and when the potatoes were done and split I drizzled a little melted butter over them first followed by the bean mix then the cheese (which I then melted in the microwave for a few min) and then a dollop of sour cream. Very good potatoes and a good twist to the old basic baked spud! Thanks!",
