Frying squash is a popular way to prepare squash in the South albeit not the healthiest way! To make it a little bit healthier without losing the flavor I sprayed the pan with Pam and then added about a tablespoon of olive oil. This way you don't have to drain anything. Rather than being deep fried it's more sauteed. I made a few other adjustments. I added a sprinkling of garlic powder and Emeril's seasoning. (any seasoned salt will do.) This gave it more flavor. If make this again I will dip the squash slices in the flour mixture to get a more even coating. It got clumpy when I mixed it all together.",
