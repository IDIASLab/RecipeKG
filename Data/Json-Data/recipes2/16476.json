Because I used stew meat, I simmered this longer than the recipe asked for......over an hour. I didn't really time it, I just simmered it until the liquid in the pan reduced by half. I also added 8 ounces of sliced fresh mushrooms to stretch the meal a little. This would have been really good BUT I think there was too much wine and I think it needs more spices. The meat was perfectly tender, the sauce was thickened and looked beautiful and it turned out like it should.........I'd like to try this again but cut the wine in half and maybe add more spices. Maybe basil and oregano? Maybe a bay leaf too?",

Plus the ever present \"better than boullion\" beef base that I always have on hand.  I added about a half cup of water and covered the pan for the 45 minute simmer just to make sure it didn't dry out.  Added a bit of kosher salt at the end.   End result was velvety smooth and rich!\nShockingly enough my two kids (age 11 and 8) also loved it and I did not have to pull out the emergency chicken nuggets for them!  :)",
