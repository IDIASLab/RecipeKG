This made the crust nice and crispy in the middle. Then while the pizza dough cooled down i cooked cut up chicken with teriyaki sauce in a pan on the stove. Be careful not to burn the teriyaki sauce (since it has so much sugar in it). When the chicken was almost done i added the pineapple juice and chunks. I didnt want to overcook the pineapple. While the chicken was cooking in a separate pan i cooked up a whole onion sauteed it in a little oil. Then when everything was cooked i layed it the following: 1. Teriyaki sauce 2. Grilled onions 3. Cheese (used shredded mozzarella and a mexican blend.) 4. Added the chicken & pineapple 5. put a little more cheese on top baked it for about 10 minutes My boyfriend wont stop talking about how good it was.",

I cooked the chicken all the way through before adding to the pizza and it was still tender! I also forgot to add the pineapple (oops!) but I added sweet red pepper which was delicious! Also I would recommend a sweet red onion because I didn't think that was overpowering at all!!! I would highly recommend this recipe! Addendum: After making this recipe for awhile this is still a family favorite! I use Pillsbury pizza crust cook it at 450 for 7 minutes without toppings then add the toppings (fully cooked chicken raw onion raw red peppers pineapple sauce cheddar cheese mozzerella cheese) and cook at 350 for about 15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly. The lower temperature allows the veggies to cook. I use the Kikkoman Baste and Glaze teriyaki sauce which works perfectly!",

I also set out a dipping bowl of Emeril's BBQ sauce and a bowl of the leftover teriyaki/ginger sauce for dipping. Oh man this is a definite keeper! I am going to use the chicken/teriyaki marinade on the chicken for other dishes as well (maybe a teriyaki stir-fry...hehe). The chicken was SO yummy and tender!!!
