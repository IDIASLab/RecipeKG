(I was in a hurry and the apples didn't seem to be getting done on top of the ham)  After the apples were nice and carmelized, I returned the ham to the pan. Nice recipe, Thanks Sarah!",

I kind of made my own by mixing together slightly less than a 1/4 cup of brown sugar with a 1/4 cup of water and several tablespoons of Kero syrup in a large Pyrex measuring cup.  (Who cares about calories) I heated it to a boil in the microwave for about 2.5 minutes.  Watch not to boil over. :o)  I also used Allspice as sugested by another reviewer. Thank you",

I served this with fresh shredded yams sauteed in a little butter with raisins thrown in and a quick drizzle of maple syrup added. The yams cook up super quick and go great with the flavor of the ham steak. It's 110 degrees here in Phoenix but this meal made it feel like fall! Mmmmmm",
