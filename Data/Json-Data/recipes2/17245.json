But there are couple of things we do differently: we grate potatoes and eggs after they are boiled, first goes salmon, then potatoes, whites, then yolks. Mayo between each layer and no mayo on the top! In my family we also add boiled and grated carrots on top of the salmon (by the way, i prefer to canned in oil - it's juicier). Some families also put steamed rice in between. This salad is called \"mimoza\".",

I also added salt & pepper to the potato layer as other reviewers suggested. For presentation purposes I finely shredded a mild white cheese and put it around the edge of my round dish.",
