Actually, I have to disagree with those who commented this sauce tasted like McDonald's -in my opinion it's much BETTER than McDonald's, if only for the reason that it is not nearly as sweet. Hubby is a hamburger with ketchup purist, but accomodated me by trying this. After a few bites of his burger I asked him what he thought of the sauce, assuming he'd remain loyal to his ketchup. He told me I should make it again. Ha! I thought the taste of the mustard was a little too evident, but he disagreed, liking it just the way it was.  We both agreed the wee bit of vinegar provided just the right tang. While it may never make ketchup take a back seat, this was definitely a nice change - loved the blend of ingredients! Much better than simply mixing mayo with ketchup and pickle relish. Glad I tried this!",

Turned out great. Make sure you REALLY like burger sauce. This recipe makes a ton. EDITED 08/03/08: After letting this sit in the fridge for about a week and a half this is close to McDonald's Big Mac Sauce. I think it's better having sit. Everyone should try to make this once. Much better than your boring old mayo/ketchup mix.",
