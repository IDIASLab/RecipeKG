If you do that, you won't have to worry about making sure the sausage is cooked properly without burning the wontons.  Also, leave out the olives and ranch dressing and add finely diced red pepper AND onion.  I think the ranch dressing doesn't fit this recipe.  You could also use an Italian 6-Blend cheese in place of the other cheeses.  With all these changes, they will taste like mini sausage sandwiches, which everyone loves.  Thanks!",

I always keep them made up in my freezer.  I mix up the filling & put that in a freezer bag (a lot of times I divide into small bags) & then bake up the shells & put those in another bag.  Works great because then I can really pull out & make whatever I need!!!  One thing I wanted to point out because I don't think the recipe makes it clear, you DO NOT pre-cook the sausage before you mix it into the rest of the ingredients.  The sausage will bake fine once you put it into the shells and bake them.  Also, much of the flavor of this recipe depends on the sausage you use so make sure you use one that has a good flavor to it.",

I skipped the olives but added some finely chopped red peppers when I sauteed my sausage. I prepared FRESH ranch dressing using the Hidden Valley packet and prepared it with 2/3 cup light mayo and about 1/2 cup of milk. I wound up using about half of this mixture in the sausage and cheese mix. The wontons turned out to be a lot easier than I thought and I found out through experimenting that you DO NOT have to brush them with oil or oil the pan. I would recommend that you only lightly prebake the shells because they will become quite brown when cooking with the filling in them. I took this to a girls night and they were all polished off and everyone wanted the recipe. A big hit!!",

It was way too sickenly ranchy creamy and the sausage was rubbery.
