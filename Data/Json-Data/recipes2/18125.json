I forgot to marinade the fish (used freshly caught grouper) so I made sure we kept basting the fish every few minutes on the grill. We placed the kabobs on top of a grilling plate and I'm glad we did - a few pieces would fall off every time we rotated them on the grill. I also added whole mushrooms to the recipe - thought this was a must! We had guests over that aren't big fish eaters and they devoured these...make sure to have atleast 3 kabobs per person! This is now my #1 fish recipe and will definitely try it with other fish and chicken.",

We accompanied it with black beans and rice (just like our favorite restaurant) and- voila!- we had one of the most GOURMET meals we've ever made at home!

I made some changes to suit my taste: I used organic portabello mushrooms purple onions (as the recipe calls for) and pineapple chunks for skewers in addition to the salmon. I seasoned my salmon lightly with sea salt and a little garlic old bay seasoning for seafood (not the traditional old bay seasoning). I also lightly seasoned my mushrooms with garlic powder and sea salt. The sauce was ok but for my taste it was not sweet enough so I added a little honey and a little brown sugar and WALLAH the most amazing sauce presented itself! J I also bypassed the marinating piece since it took a while to chop all the vegetables make the sauce etc. Instead I spooned the sauce on each kabob and placed the kabobs under the boiler turning once when the first side was lightly browned. I almost forgot I also simmered the pineapples chunks in the sauce and used these pineapples for the kabobs; it only took a minute or two for the pineapples to cool down to handle. I served with organic Basmati rice and broccoli. It was so amazingly good I can't wait for dinner tonight!:) P.S. I made about a little over two pounds of salmon; doubled the ingredients and used three portobello mushrooms and used two cans of pineapple chunks for the juice and chunks! This made about 15 kabobs in total.",
