The only change I made was adding a little bit extra garlic and fresh basil (use 2xs as much). SO SO SO GOOD I am fighting myself to not eat it all! Edit I also like to top this with croutons and fresh parmesan cheese. It's also very good if you put it in a blender (I use a hand blender) and puree it with a bit of cream. Just be sure to remove the bay leaf! One last thing I always make this with (gasp) canned tomatoes!",
