I mixed all the ingredients and crab first including adding more mayo dijon mustard instead of the powder cayenne nixed the paprika added a little onion powder and loaded it with Old Bay. Kept tasting and messing with it until my base tasted like a crab cake mixture. Then I added about 3/4 of the yellows to that mixture and doctored some more until I liked the taste. I just think this is one of those recipes you have to play with and keep sampling until you get it where you want it. But the end result turned out fabulous and my guests LOVED them.
