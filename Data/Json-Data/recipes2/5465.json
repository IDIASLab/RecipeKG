This recipe takes a little while, but it's worth it!  Extremely fresh-tasting with all the veggies.  I actually really liked the lemon zest and thought it could have used a bit more.  Oh, one somewhat major change: I didn't have shredded parmesan, so instead I did a little less than 1/4C of grated parm.  Seemed to work out just fine, but I really want to try it the right way next time.  As a side, it makes A LOT, but we used it as a meatless dinner. Lots of leftovers!  Will definitely be making this again.",

I didn t have shallots so I substituted two small vidalia onions and about 1 1/2 tablespoons of crushed garlic (fresh). I was low on red cherry tomatoes so I added what I had left in the yellow ones. I thought it gave it nice colors with the green asparagus (which I doubled from what the recipe calls for). This will be a favorite despite the need to watch it closely as you add 1 cup of broth at a time to allow it to absorb. Worth it!",
