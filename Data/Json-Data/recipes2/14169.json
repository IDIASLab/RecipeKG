Now came the really rude surprise: the fruit DOES NOT easily come away from the huge pit (nothing like a peach!). I squished and squeezed and scraped that pulp away. It took what seemed FORever! What did I do wrong? Are there different kinds of mangos? I served this to my ladies' Euchre group and got rave reviews for the taste. I insisted that even the dieter's have some because of how much work went into it. LOL! One of the gals suggested that this would be great made with peaches - I'll sure try that next time!",
