In case you did not know, thickening agents do not come to their full thickening potential until they come to a boil.  Therefore, you can add all the cornstarch and water (known as a slurry) you want (or roux for that matter), but it will not obtain its full thickening power until it boils with the liquid it is supposed to thicken.  I would not recommend boiling the half and half, so I would do the first part, adding the slurry to the chicken stock, boil that for a few minutes, adjust thickness if needed with more slurry (cornstarch and water, it works best if the cornstarch is whisked into cold water), lower the heat, add the half and half and the cheese, stir until the cheese melts, and then serve.  I have not made this soup, but reading through the reviews, it seems a lot of people have trouble with the thickness so I am just offering a suggestion and/or advice.",

After having discovered the soup was horribly thin, I added copious amounts of corn starch in a hasty attempt to thicken it. I had already added an additional cup of cheese, and with the extra corn starch the recipe was a splendid success. Best when served with garlic bread. This recipe is also quite easy to prepare and is ready to serve in minimal time, but beware: not enough corn starch will leave you unbearably dissatisfied.",

The Bud didn't do much for it at all. I also followed the advice of another commenter and dissolved the cornstarch in the chicken broth then added it and brought it to a boil then added beer and brought to a boil then slowly added the cheese by the small handful (I used sharp cheddar) and let it dissolve before adding more stirring very often. I also cooked and crumbled some bacon for sprinkles and bought a loaf of dense dark German bread which I toasted. Very delicious and easy! 2/26/09 I just noticed a mistake: I add the cream before I add the cheese. But I have changed the way I make this soup! I make it all the time. I have been cooking 1/2 lb. of bacon in pot then cooking the onion and garlic in bacon grease. I changed it around and now use the beer to deglaze the pan then bring to a boil for 3 minutes then add chicken broth and cornstarch and bring to a boil. Next I turn the heat down and add the cream or half-n-half. I do slowly add the cheese by sprinkling it over the surface of the liquid and letting it melt. I stir that in and then repeat til I used all the cheese. I serve the crumbled bacon and sour cream for toppers. I also put a whole yellow onion in and I think it makes the soup more filling. My soup is usually pretty thick so I just add more chicken broth to make it the consistancy I like and that includes",
