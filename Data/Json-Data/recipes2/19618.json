First of all....pretend you are Chef John making a video, and HAVE ALL YOUR INGREDIENTS PROPORTIONED AND READY!  Things happen fast, and you NEED to be ready.  My first attempt, I made the mistake of having skillet TOO HOT, and burnt the cheese and smoked up the kitchen.  You want the skillet to just start smoking, not heavily smoking and olive oil evaporating.  Suggest you make a batch for yourself to practice first before trying to impress your special someone.",
