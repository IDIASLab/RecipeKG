If you put the salt on too early it will dry the fish out by drawing out the moisture. Second, I used only a pinch of salt on each side so maybe even a little less than what this calls for but its all about personal taste. Lastly I added a few splashes of white wine when I put the steaks in the pan. It not only adds a nice flavor to the fish but if you then take out the fish and add a little more wine while the pan is really hot it will deglaze your pan and leave you with a really nice white wine and peppercorn reduction (or pan gravy however you wanna call it) for your fish.",

Typically seared means just that, if your pan is hot enough it should be just a quick cook on high heat to seal in the juices. I think I cooked it a total of 20-30 SECONDS per side. The out side had a wonderful crust and the inside was raw. (Make sure you use Sushi Grade fish) It was UH-MAY-ZING! I used my cast iron pan on med/high-high heat. It tasted just like seared Ahi that I have had in fancy restaurants. Definitely a keeper!",

I did follow others & cut back salt to 3/4 tsp. I added dried dill to the salt cayenne mixture b/c I love it w/ fish. I also added minced garlic to oil and peppercorn. After cooking I deglazed iron skillet as suggested by another w/ squeeze of lime a bit of balsamic and white wine and put a spoonful over each serving. BIG thumbs up by ENTIRE fam of which the kids are not big fish eaters. THANKS for the recipe!!!",
