Followed the recipe to the letter even pouring in the condensed milk mixture over the back of a spoon. The milk portion sunk to the bottom of the mug and that s OK. The one thing that I didn t care for was how the spices puddled around the top of the mug and I'm not sure why that happened. The recipe doesn t say to stir together but I have to wonder if this may have helped a bit. And that s not to say that I didn t like this because the flavor is very good and it certainly was refreshing.This reviewer is an Allrecipes Allstar.
