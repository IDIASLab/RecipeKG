I asked several questions and made a few changes - I used butter rather than margarine, increased the apple and used a combination of Fuji and Gravenstein (picked fresh from the tree), I added a touch of fresh ginger and used brown sugar instead of the Stevia.  Because one batch actually makes 3-4 batches of 8-12 mini muffins, I found each quarter batch freezes well also. When I serve for non-diabetics (most of the time) I sprinkle it with a modified streusel before it goes in the oven - flour, cinnamon and brown sugar (no butter, so I can keep it in the pantry).  Thank you!  This is becoming a go-to!",
