Someone asked me what store I bought them from because they tasted too good to be homemade??? Anyway an important note for those going to make this. #1 - Use REAL bacon bits NOT the crunchy bacon flavored salad toppings because that is all I had and the bacon flavor was a little too strong that way. #2 the recipe takes a little more time than it says but highly worth it - just give yourself some more time. #3 Also the recipe as listed says that it serves 8 by making 24 mushrooms. Increase this number these are so good most of your guests will want to eat more than 3 each.",

I normally try not to make changes to a recipe until I try it once but I made several changes out of necessity on this one and they turned out well. I didn't have green onion so I used yellow onion (grated- 1/4c.). I also cut the butter that you drizzle before baking to 1/4 c. instead of 1/2 c. These are very rich but extremely tasty. This was my first try at stuffed mushrooms and they were easier than expected. I will definitely make this recipe again.",

I cut the lemons in small \"drink size\" wedges and just dumped them over the plate for people to take and use if they wished. Like the idea of the hot sauce I will have to try that nest time. Also I bought jumbo mushrooms for a \"dinner\" appetizer but making these for the parties I used the more \"normal\" size mushrooms for a finger food and it made about 30!
