They're already thawed. And they have a \"southwestern style\" type, too. Love love love this recipe.",

It goes quickly at potlucks, but also keeps well for leftovers (if there are any). My only suggestion, is layering the ingredients & adding about 1/4 cup of milk to the soup/sour cream mixture (which is otherwise VERY thick). I place a layer of hashbrowns first, then spoon a layer of the mixture on top, repeating layers. Seems to hold together better and cook more evenly. It can also be quite bland without adding some extra spices, so I usually add some garlic powder, onion powder and whatever else to taste into the soup/sour cream/milk mixture. And for cheese lovers- sprinkling a layer of cheese on top, over the crushed cornflakes is a nice addition. This is a great recipe to make ahead of time and bake when ready- very hearty comfort food.",

My main variation is that sometimes I make it with \"O'Brien\" potatoes instead of the plain hash browns. But over the past few years I have had to vary the recipe for members of my family with either dietary limitations or simply are very limited to what they enjoy in their dishes. To make it low-cal I use fat-free cream of chicken soup fat free sour cream and low fat cheddar cheese. I make the crushed crackers with smart balance instead of butter. I think it tastes just as good as the \"fully loaded\" version.",
