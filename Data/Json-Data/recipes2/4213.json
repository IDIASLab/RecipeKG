It got rave reviews and recipe request with our small group Bible study last night. The frosting recipe definately make too much. So I used my leftovers on a second cake a week later. I bulked it up with a little more coco milk and powdered sugar. Stored it in the fridge while cake cooled. I whipped it up with the beaters again when I went to frost my cake. Everything seemed fine but as I was frosting it started melting and sort of turned into a big mess. Not sure what happened there but still delicious and no complaints! I will make this recipe over and over! Oh I couldn't find \"instant\" coconut cream pudding in our store so I used the \"cook and serve\" variety in the recipe the same way.",

The cake is easy to whip up although I did have to use regular coconut pudding mix as I could not find any of the instant kind. The cakes were VERY moist so much so that I cracked one taking it out of the pan. I will know better next time. One other thing that I did was make less frosting. I used about 1/4 cup of butter 1/4 cup coconut milk 1/2 tsp coconut extract and 2 cups icing sugar and there was just enough frosting to cover the cake. Everyone who tries this cake loves it!
