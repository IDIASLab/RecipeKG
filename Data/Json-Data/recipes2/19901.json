I substituted pizza sauce for the pasta sauce and I browned and crumbled italian sausage instead of using the frozen burger style crumbles. In addition I only used half as much bread crumbs and twice as much parmesan cheese. It satisfied my pizza craving and I didn't feel like I missed my favorite food. Thanks!!",
