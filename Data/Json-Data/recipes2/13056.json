        "description": "Tomato pie has been sold by Iannelli's Bakery in Philadelphia since 1910. Tomato pie remains popular in Philadelphia where it is cut into long strips and called pizza strips, red bread, party pizza, strip pizza, or bakery pizza. It may be sprinkled with Romano cheese or oregano. It is not usually served straight from the oven, but allowed to cool and then consumed at room temperature or reheated. Like Sicilian pizza, tomato pie is baked in a large rectangular pan and served in square slices. It resembles the Italian sfincione.",
