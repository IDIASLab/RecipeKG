The extra chicken worked great. Being as I had more filling, and my zucchini were slightly small, I just used 5 zucchini instead of 3. I lined a large sheet pan, with sides, with foil. They all fit. I liked how this had so many vegetables zucchini, onion, mushroom, broccoli, and tomato. When saut\u00e9ing the chicken it kept wanting to steam. I finally added 1 Tblsp of grape seed oil and it crisped up great. After I scooped the zucchini, I realized the middle was mainly seeds with their size. So, I didn't bother to add it to the sauce. I filled all 10 halves and basically used the small bag of mozzarella cheese I bought. I didn't bother to measure. It took one large tomato. I sliced it thin. They baked in about 23 minutes and then I turned the oven to a low broil and added about 3 more minutes to brown the top. ty",

My husband took the broccoli I had for lunch that day so that unfortunately got left out. I didn't have any tomatoes either so I served them with some marinara sauce on the side. I'm thinking this will be a great meal for baby-sitting my niece and nephew because it's gluten-free (nephew's allergic) and it's really a fun dish to eat because everyone gets their own \"boat.\" This was an easy weeknight meal and I'm looking forward to the leftovers for MY lunch today. Very versatile recipe which I love. Yummy!",

I had good intentions when it came to following the recipe but found myself astray as usual. I only had one large zucchini. I opted not to put the extra zucchini in the chicken filling because I was afraid it would make it too watery. I also needed zucchini for another use so it worked in my favor. Love broccoli and mushrooms so doubled the amount. Went with homemade Alfredo sauce using allrecipes recipe for To Die For Fettuccine Alfredo --cutting the recipe in half. It took 45 minutes to get the zucchini boat cooked all the way through. Probably because I used a large zucchini.",
