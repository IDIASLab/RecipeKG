Marinated about 6 hours and the T-Bone steaks were fork tender and great tasting - not sweet at all, as one might expect.  Just delicious grilled over medium heat charcoal to desired doneness.  Next I will try it with chicken and pork tenderloin - my family can't wait.  Thanks Doreen!",

But this time my husband and I thought this recipe was the best one I had ever made. It called for vegetable oil, but I didn't have vegetable oil, we use olive oil for diet reasons, so used it and combined it with what safflower oil I had (canola would be equally good). Also didn't have fresh ginger but had ground ginger and put about the same amount of it as it called for the fresh. I marinated a cheap sirloin that I cut up in chunks for 2 hours or less. Other than that I followed the recipe to the \"T\". I can just imagine what it would have tasted like using fresh ginger. But had the ground ginger so opted for it. I also used the same recipe for the veggies (marinated them) that I skewered with the meat. They tasted wonderful too. Thank You Doreen! Will definitely use this recipe from now on! Will probably even try it on chicken!",

I used this on pork sirloin chops and let them marinate for 1-1/2 days. I used about a tsp of granulated garlic since I didn't feel like chopping the real thing. I didn't have any honey so I used brown sugar and my hubby informed me that he added some saki in there at some point. My 16 month old had 2 helpings!! I look forward to using this again.

Marinated a large 7lb-8lb eye of round roast overnight and flipped it over in the morning. Let it stand on counter til room temp. so it would cook evenly. Braised it all over on top of the stove then Cooked at 375 degree oven at 20 mins. per pound. Put some Oil and water and Onions quartered in roaster and let it cook. I did not think I was going to like the roast because of the \"smell\" not sure if it was the soya sauce or ginger or both but it was awfully strong. Anyway cooked it like I said and to my AMAZEMENT it was Moist and juicy and probably one of the BEST roasts I've ever cooked. For a cheap cut of meat It very well could have been a Rump or Sirloin tip!!!!! This was my first time marinating a Roast of Beef and would definately recommend it!!",

We were in heaven and will never have ribs any other way again. I marinaded them in Doreens recipe for 5 hrs (next time over night!) and then braised them in the marinade in the oven for 2hrs on 300 degrees basting with the marinade every 30 minutes before grilling with the BBQ sauce (honey BBQ goes fabulous with this marinade).
