I had begun a starter on January 1, before I found Chef John's starter recipe, and have used that starter.  I have already made this recipe four times using bread flour, and twice using a combination of whole wheat and bread flours. Each time turned out great, and I live above 5,000 ft. I do not have a bread form, and have used a bowl sprayed with cooking spray and sprinkled with corn meal. I like the looks and taste of corn meal with this simple bread, so no problem for me. This is a lovely addition to an \"interesting breads\" collection. Thank you for a tasty, simple recipe.",

The bread itself is great, but over the year or so I've been experimenting and found that substituting 100 grams of the water with buttermilk produces a much more satisfying bread for my taste. This may have to do with the youngness of my starter, or the area I live in, who knows. But I'd give the recipe as stated 4 stars and the adjusted recipe 5 stars.",

So added flour, a lot more flour until it got back to being a dough and let it slow rise in the fridge. the bread comes out super creamy the first day.  The second day it becomes much, much denser. So I toasted it.  It was better than those quick sourdough recipes, but not yet where I want it to be.",

I like using a bit less water than he uses so the dough is a little bit sturdier - not much though, the moistness of the fresh loaf depends on it.  I tried something different last time and came out with a nice dough.  I made the dough before bedtime, and let it rise overnight on the counter, then shaped it and let sit in the fridge for several hours and baked as directed in CJ's  recipe.  Maybe it was a great sourdough day, but it was the best loaf I've made to date.",

Weighing the ingredients was great and the recipe turned out just like it should. I cook mine for 32 mins and it turns out nice and crispy.  25 mins was like, JUST cooked. A baker friend of mine suggested using a cast iron pan lined with parchment if you have it available.\n\nTIP 1: if you're going to substitute the banneton with a kitchen cloth make sure that it is VERY tightly knit fabric. Nothing like towel fibres  or else  your bread will stick. Think more like a handtowel or tablecloth fabric.\n\nTIP 2: Its important to shape your loaf into a ball by pulling the sides into the middle as you turn the loaf. Watch YouTube. This will create tension on the surface of the ball and help it rise really well.",

It looked like it hadn t risen at all. I put it in a warm toaster oven for 30 minutes. I heated my ceramic pot with lid on in a 450F oven. Placed the dough in the hot pot scored it like # a hash tag and replaced the hot lid. Quickly placed the pot in the oven. Baked for 20 minutes at 450F (although temp wavers with opening of oven door. ). Lowered heat to 400F baked for 20 minutes more. I got a nice ear on the dough too.",

Love the sourdough tomato bread ( include paste basil and Sundried tomato) the sourdough taste with the sweet cinnamon rolls was not something we like. Like my cinnamon roll recipe better. We really enjoy this recipe for bread.",
