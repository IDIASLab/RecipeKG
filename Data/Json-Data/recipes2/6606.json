I crushed the garlic and even though I am a garlic lover I think I will cut back by at least one clove the next time (personal taste preference). Some black olive slices would have been a nice addition to this cheese blend. This was so easy to make it's almost sinful and the topping possibilities are endless. Thanks Brent we liked it!",

Beyond that there just was too much...of just about everything. I used two small cloves of garlic and that was plenty - I can't imagine using three times that much! Three quarters of a cup of Parmesan/Romano is about 2/3 too much. A sprinkle even 1/3 cup would have been more palatable. Also mozzarella was a better choice at least for us than cheddar and parsley a reduced amount a better choice than basil. The bottom line unfortunately was that this was a soft thin bread-like \"crust\" with an overload of Parmesan/Romano and garlic.",

It is almost like our favorite garlic cheese bread from one of the pizza restaurants near us. I did read the reviews from fellow AR members about cutting back on the garlic. I cut it down to 4 (3 small & 1 big) but the next time I will only use 3. I had fresh basil that I froze so I grabbed a few leaves and cut them up over the crust. I baked this for 11 minutes and it was the color I was looking for. Thanks Brent for sharing your recipe it will be made again in our house.",
