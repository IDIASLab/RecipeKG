I followed this recipe but had to skip some of the hot peppers due to a lack of tolerance for \"hot stuff\". Two of the most notable components were the Mascarpone and the Garlic Basil Spread. They take this sandwich from very good to GREAT! Two other must have components.....a fork and knife. This thing is messy good and you'll want to get every bite. This puppy is headed for my super bowl menu. Thanks so much for sharing!!!",

I used provolone cheese and it turned out nicely. We ended up eating with a knife and fork - I really piled the ingredients high. I used a marinara sauce recipe from this site and the flavors and textures blended well. Make sure your roll is big enough to take all the ingredients. I used French bread and ended up having to wait to get the sandwiches out of the oven to add the marinara to it because the bread wasn't thick enough. One negative is that it takes a little work to make them. It's worth the effort. Thanks for sharing.",
