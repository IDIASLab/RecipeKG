I toasted some macadamia nuts then chopped them for the top and the sides. I also took some frozen whole cherries chopped them and put them all across the top. I did not use as much wine as mentioned but did follow the soaking and poured some on top the night before I served it. It was incredible- and everyone has asked me for the delicious recipe! Thank you for bringing something delish to the usually not so delish passover dessert table!",
