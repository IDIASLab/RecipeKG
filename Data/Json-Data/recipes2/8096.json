The caramelized cheese formed a thin but protective layer and, since the eggs had never directly touched the pan, they were moist and tender. This will also work whether you use one or three eggs, depending on the texture you're going for. Using a single egg is kind of a cool trick, since the cheese layer is almost as thick, and you can really appreciate the crispness even more.",
