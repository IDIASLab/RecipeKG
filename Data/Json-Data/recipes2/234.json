Using fresh basil is also key but you could change up the flavor by using fresh tarragon or oregano. It was just as good the next day.

I haven't really liked any green bean salads I've tried before, but this one is fantastic. The dressing really makes it special, although the toasted almonds are essential too. Perfect way to use up summer produce, will definitely take this to summer BBQs in the future!",
