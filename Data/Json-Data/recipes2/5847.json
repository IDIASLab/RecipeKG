What a nice lunch I had this sandwich with a fresh fruit salad and I will definately make this again. I will deliberately buy goat cheese just for this. Soooooo good.",

The flavors blend together very well and it's unique compared to the usual sandwich fare. I had to change a few things based on what I had on hand. I used honey whole wheat which was good but I'm betting sour dough would've been a knockout. I used a regular onion rather than a shallot and I had to use dried dill instead of fresh. I scaled down the recipe using only about 3/4 of a log of goat cheese and 1.5 tsp of dried dill if anyone is curious. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.",
