I used broccoli and roasted red peppers instead of zucchini.

I used a large can of tomato sauce (680ml) rather than paste and only had 1 can of diced tomatoes on hand. I used a frozen block of spinach (thawed from the night before). I put an extra layer of noodles on top with some sauce and parm. cheese on them to help avoid from hardening too much...all in all it tasted great!",
