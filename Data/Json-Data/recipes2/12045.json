I also agree with the notes - I didn't think there was going to be enough liquid to make a batter.  But keep stirring, it'll get there.  It's an extremely thick batter, but it bakes up into great little muffins.  If you're looking for something with a super pumpkin spice flavor, this isn't really it, but the chips give them a really nice cinnamon flavor.  Next time I might add a little ginger and nutmeg to push it further toward the pumpkin spice flavors, but you can't ask for an easier recipe.  These might be really great with applesauce instead of pumpkin, too.",
