Stick with the butter in the recipe and add a couple teaspoons of sugar to the squash while its frying - this will help it caramelize and brown.

I added another 1/2 of a tablespoon and the recipe went to yuck. Then I tried to add more salt and grated parmesan cheese to salvage it and to me it came out with a strange taste. It tasted like I put mayonnaise on it. I don't like mayonnaise so this didn't work for me at all even after the revisions.
