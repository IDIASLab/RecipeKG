After saute veggies, mix in veal/beef/pork (1/2 pound each). Add wine & stir until almost evaporated.  You need the wine because red wine releases the last bit of sweetness in the tomato. Then add 1/2C whole milk & stir until evaporated. Next, tomato, etc. and simmer away. If you have a parmesan rind, toss this in when simmering. Always better the next day, but also great in lasagna.",
