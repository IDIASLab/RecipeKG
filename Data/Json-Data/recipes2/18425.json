I too cut back on the amount of macaroni but used 1.5 cans of stewed diced tomatoes some butter and two crushed garlic cloves in addition to the cheese. Oh and I used sharp cheddar monterey jack and mozzarella (all I had on hand) as well as a spoonful of sour cream and it came out just fine. I imagine some cooked ground beef turkey or shredded chicken would also go well with this dish. Lots of options for a meal like this one and served with a nice side salad and some bread it makes an easy and quick dinner for a hungry family.",

A few changes we make - we use canned whole tomatoes and squish them up with our fingers - they just always seem juicier and some folks don't like stewed tomatoes or always have them on hand.  We also add a lot of ground black pepper (I prefer fresh cracked but you can use ready-ground too).  Just as a note - this is NOT a creamy mac and cheese recipe - not meant to be!  The cheese will be rather clumpy and not spread throughout but it is marvelous that way!  One hint - if you do have leftovers, saute them in a little butter/margarine the next day - even better!!!!",
