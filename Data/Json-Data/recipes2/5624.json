I used my Weber Smokey Joe to grill them, making sure to slow things down a bit by closing vents and covering after coals were well-lit (white with ash). Then crack the vents (upper & lower) throw on a handful of pre-soaked hickory chips, and gently grill your burgers (lid on!) Don't overcook! Olive oil both grill and burgers first. Use your hand along with the spatula when turning. Make extra sauce... you'll want to use it on more than these salmon burgers... trust me. Enjoy. I sure did!\nFlorida Floyd",
