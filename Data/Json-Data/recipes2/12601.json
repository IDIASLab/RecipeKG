I thought it had just the right amount of \"kick'\" to it although I used the same amount of spices in the recipe but with 2 cups of seeds. I think it would have been way too much for only 1 cup. I also rinsed and soaked the seeds overnight in water. I baked them for longer than indicated until they seemed to be done. I shared with my Livestrong class and had requests for the recipe.",
