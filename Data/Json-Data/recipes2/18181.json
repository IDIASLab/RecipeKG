By the way, for those of you who substitute chili powder, it's not quite the same as the paste (though if you don't have/can't find the paste, it should work). It's thick and spicy, and really enhances the flavor for the chicken. I found mine in the produce section of Ultra Foods (I would assume it'd be in the same place as other major grocery stores. I had never heard of chili paste before until I accidentally stumbled upon it and realized what it was.) They are in squeeze tubes, near the fresh herbs. Look for it, because the paste makes all the difference! Wonderful, wonderful recipe! Hands down, a keeper!",

I used 3/4 of a pound of fresh shrimp instead of chicken. I also added one red bell pepper, fresh mushrooms and a can of diced tomates. Instead of just 6 Tablespoons of pesto sauce, I used the whole small jar that they have in the spaghetti aisle and I added the 4 oz. of goat cheese at the end. Also, the chili paste that I used I found in the Asian food aisle of the grocery store and it was called Roasted Chili Paste. Not sure it that is the same stuff that the recipe called for but it gave it a little kick and a nice flavor. Very good recipe with a few changes and additions.\n\n***UPDATE***  Just made this again the other night, used diced up chicken breasts, red bell pepper, red onion and diced tomatoes. Instead of goat cheese this time, I used 8 oz of reduced fat cream cheese with the pesto sauce and 3/4 cup of half and half. The cream cheese helped the pesto coat the pasta better. It was FABULOUS!!! This recipe is so easy to play with.",
