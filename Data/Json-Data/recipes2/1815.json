The flavor is great with those additions and the toasted coconut is wonderful. The dough is more of a thick batter that gets dropped on the baking sheet so I did chill the dough for 30 minutes prior to baking. These are a nice cakey cookie. I took these to a small gathering and they got very good reviews though my husband did suggest that they would be better with the addition of butterscotch chips. I lined the baking pan with non-stick pan lining paper and allowed to cool on a metal rack.",

They tasted ok but this would not be a recipe I would search out to make again. I prefer a chewier texture and these definitely need more taste. There wasn't any real flavor that stuck out. I know what was in them but seems like there was not enough to make any of the flavors shine through. Maybe would be better tasting with a few adjustments.",
