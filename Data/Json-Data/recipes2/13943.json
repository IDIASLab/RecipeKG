My husband who usually wants to try new recipes all the time asks for this one at least every other week. Great recipe!",

I am Italian and just never put ranch on my pizza dough. I tried it...oh my gosh is it deeeeelicious! My husband loved it my kids loved it... I used my own pizza dough and I sauteed everything in butter but the broccoli which I boiled first. I know the butter takes away from the healthiness but who cares. It helped the veggies become nice and tender before cooking. This recipe is wonderful!!!!",

I left out the cauliflower and added some sliced tomato. One note regarding the amount of ranch. I just poured a little bit on the pizza dough and used a spatula to gently even it out. Then I poured a little more until the dough was covered. It's much easier and probably healthier since I didn't use close to 1 1/2 cups.",
