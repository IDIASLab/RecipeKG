I was frying them as an app as my dinner guests showed up, they were going so fast and were so tasty I completely forgot to snap a pic! Definitely a huge hit, It was funny watching everyone to try and be polite but also anxious to grab them up as they came out of the fryer. there was 6 of us and everyone loved them. \n\n1.  I will say these are a bit on the fishy side, we loved it BUT If you despise the kick of a fishy taste skip the fish sauce and maybe half or exclude the anchovies, that will really tone it down. \n2. I bought extra large Mrs. Baird's white bread. The recipe went a lot further than 4 pieces of bread, the paste coated more like 9-11 pieces. and I really put it on thick. \n3. I forgot to toast the bread ahead of time and everything was perfect so don't worry if you forget that step. \n4. The suggested Fry time is on point, 2-3 minutes\n5. keep your windows open or a air purifier handy, this will fish up your house. \n\nDefinitely a repeat, I really can't wait to make these again and am already trying to think of the next opportunity I can dish theses out and watch my guests eyes light up with delight. I may just simply make some for lunch and invite my dad over. They are the bomb.",

I'm a huge fan of him, I've loved everything I have tried just as he's written it. I'm also a huge fan of shrimp toast, always ordering it when it is on the menu, so I was excited to find his version. I had 10 oz. of shrimp and wanted to use it all, so I adjusted the recipe on here to get the right amount of seasonings and flavorings. I'm not sure what to change, but it was a bit \"strong\" to me. Perhaps next time I will try to make using his amount of shrimp so I don't adjust other items and see what that gets me. It was a bit salty for me, so I'll wait to add salt after tasting. Also, I think I might put shrimp in last and pulse a little less to have a few larger bits of shrimp. I'll let you know how that turns out. I still have some paste, so I'd like to try a few baked just to see if it will still have that awesome crunch. Keep 'me coming, Chef John, I love your art!",
