When the onion was softened I added 2 minced garlic cloves and cooked that for about a minute while stirring. Then I added the chicken seasoned with salt and pepper cooked for 5 minutes then flipped the chicken and added two thinly sliced apples 1 tsp crushed dried rosemary 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and some apple juice in which to braise the chicken. I covered this and let it simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. When it was finished the apples and onion had softened together and I had a really nice thick sauce on top. This was great served over rice! With my modifications I'd give this recipe 5 stars but I would find it too bland and dry without the onions and apple juice. Thanks for the great starter recipe!",
