You really only need enough red wine vinegar to coat the steaks which is about 1/4 the amount (depending on how big they are). I put everything into a zip loc bag and let set in the fridge for an HOUR turning it a couple of times - then disgarded the marinade. Let the steaks come to room temperature and then grill. This way you get a nice hint of vinegar and the other flavors also come through - another big plus is the steaks come out tender and juicy.",

However this recipe caught my eye so I gave it a shot. You gotta like the taste and aftertaste of the red wine vinegar to enjoy this recipe. I did not care for that flavor but that's why I started this review the way I did. Any type of vinegar flavor on a good cut of meat is not my favorite. That being said the rest of the ingredients coupled with a heavy red wine worked for me the second time around. Most vinegars impart a unique flavor to every dish. This one was too much for me but that doesn't mean it's bad for another taster. My suggestion is to cut the red wine vinegar at least in half or one quarter and go from there. Good luck and happy eating.",
