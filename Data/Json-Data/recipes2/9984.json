This turns the rice into a stew-like consistency. I ended up having to drain the rice before serving. I would use no more than 1/4 cup of broth. You could probably even get by with less. Also this makes very small servings. If you're going to be eating this as a main meal I'd say there are about 2 servings max.",

I could not find the Uncle Bens ready rice at our local grocery store so I substituted Uncle Bens country rice garden vegetable instead which called for 2 cups of water in the directions I used 2 cups of chicken broth to try and stay close to the recipe I was following. A great recipe for busy week nights.",

                "reviewBody": "I knew from experience that this recipe called for unnecessary liquid. I have used Ready Rice by Uncle Ben's before and there is really no need for the extra liquid. The rice has moisture and is not dry even after heating. My reason for the three stars is for the directions mainly as they are (in my opinion) misleading. The recipe \"idea\" is a very good concept. Ready rice is a very convenient and easy to use product. It is consistent in quality and great in a time crunch! I like quick dishes that can also be used for lunch the next day so this recipe was used with that in mind. Again I followed this loosely. I made the rice as the package directed. I added in a generous cup of fresh cut salsa vegetables I usually have on hand. I also added about a half a cup of black beans. I skipped the chicken as I don't eat much meat but it would be a great way to use up some leftovers! This was a super quick meal and was even better for lunch the next day. The recipe as it stands is unnecessarily complicated for a product ready to eat in 90 seconds. Buy the rice - add your choice of mix-ins or leftovers and as much as you like. You can't go wrong.",
