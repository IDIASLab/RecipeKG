The seasonings are spot on - no need to add anything else. I used boneless country style ribs and the meat was just fall apart tender. I followed the recipe exactly except that I ended up adding a bit more of the cooking liquid (about 1/4 cup more) to the meat mixture so it would be nice and moist. Taking into account the broken shells that always come in a pasta box I ended up with 30 very well stuffed shells. I also used a slightly bigger dish - 11 x 13 - to fit them all. While stuffing shells might be a little time consuming the finished dish is WELL worth it. I will definitely be making this again. It would be a perfect dish to wow company!",

I let the shells go 2 minutes under the recommended time and then drained and let cool while the pork was going so they would be easy to handle. This pork recipe on its own is absolutely stellar and I almost made soup out of the remaining pan sauce--sooo delicious! I used smoked paprika and the little bit of smoky flavor was spot on. This is a beautiful presentation and totally guest-worthy since the shells are a tidy way to serve pasta!",

I cheated just a bit... as I decided at about 1:30 p.m. that I was going to make this for dinner tonight. I only marinated the pork for about 2 hours then I sauteed it in my InstantPot for 3-5 minutes then added the marinade & chicken broth and cooked it in my InstantPot on manual setting for 45 minutes. Worked great! The only thing I would change is to only boil the shells for about 8 minutes. The box says 9 minutes but even at 9 minutes mine were breaking slightly. They will continue to cook while in the oven - so no worries. Great recipe though and one that I'd make again!",
