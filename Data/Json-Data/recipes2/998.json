I started the water for the pasta, started heating the tomatoes & gave them a little smash with my potato masher.  By the time I had snipped the fresh basil the water was boiling as were the tomatoes.   A couple slices of bread to soak up the extra sauce, along with a green salad and a sprinkle of Parmesan.   Fine dining in the time it took to cook pasta.  BTW - I used Penne pasta but any kind would be great.",

Second time I made it the only difference I made was use 1/2 and 1/2  and add some more fresh garlic.  Perfect weeknight sauce if you like lots of fresh basil and chunks of tomato. Only suggestion is to double for family. I made this for 2 people and we used all the sauce.",
