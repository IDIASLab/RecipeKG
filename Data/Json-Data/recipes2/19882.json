There ae so many ways you can vary it, and if it doesn't come out \"right\" it's because you didn't cook your rice right. Just because one person doesn't like a recipe does that make it bad.  Food is all according to taste.  You know, some like their foods spicy hot, others don't, etc. Adjust it to your taste or miss out on a good recipe!!",
