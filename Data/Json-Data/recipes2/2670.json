Yogurt doesn't come in 8-oz containers anymore so I used just one of the 5.3 oz containers of Chobani coconut Greek yogurt (couldn't find toasted coconut vanilla yogurt) and a good dollop of Cabot vanilla Greek yogurt which added quite a bit of tang. I liked this smoothie but didn't think it really was too close to a pina colada flavor (admittedly that could have been a result of having to add more milk). Toasted a little coconut which was a nice garnish and added some needed coconut flavor to the smoothie. Next time I will try only one frozen fruit.",
