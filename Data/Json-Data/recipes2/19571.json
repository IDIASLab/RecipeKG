I just loved this!! I made just a small amount (1/4 of the recipe) using half black and half pimento stuffed green olives. I sliced my bread and toasted both sides under the broiler spread on the cheese mixture and broiled again until just beginning to bubble and brown. I noticed that there s no salt in this recipe but after tasting it I realized immediately that no salt is needed as there is plenty in the olives. I will definitely make this again and I m anxious to try it using a greek olive blend I ve found at the olive bar in the deli at my grocery store. I can see adding a little green onion to this too! YUM! UPDATE 12/2/10 - Made this again using sliced ciabatta and the same black and pimento stuffed green olives but this time I added some well drained diced pimentos for more color - beautiful!",

It's just a few ingredients but they compliment each other nicely. It's a very nice looking appetizer if you slice it on the diagonal. Will make again. It's a great compliment to soup or even a salad if you're looking for a lite supper. Thanks. Update 12/2010. Made this again and used some red green & yellow peppers and it was delicious!! I also used lite mayo and butter alternative to cut back on the grams of fat. Didn't miss the fat one bit. It was great!",
