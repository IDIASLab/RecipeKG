Next time we're going to add some meat of some kind to make it more of a main dish. Spice it up with a little cumin and some smoked paprika and chili powder and this is YUMMY!",

I gave the recipe five stars because it does have great flavor and I liked the taste...I don't think though that my husband or I care for the texture of hominy itself much. But I didn't think that my review should reflect that as it isn't the fault of the recipe. Anyway if you like hominy this is a good recipe with great cheesy flavor!",
