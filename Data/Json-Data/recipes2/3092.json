I made a half portion and about 2/3 into it, my aversion to kale kicked in-but the first 2/3 were enjoyed. I imagine a kale lover will give this 5 stars. I used a blender, as written in the notes, but had to add a couple of ice cubes and a bit of almond milk to thin it out to a drinkable consistency. Thank you for the recipe. I'm glad I tried it.",

Also added some chia seeds to help fill me up.  You couldn't even tell they were in there.  This recipe makes for a very large glass. If you are unsure if you will like it, it would be easy to cut the recipe in half.  Great recipe for liquid or Daniel fasts.",
