I finished all 6 servings in one day! Thank god I'm lazy and don't get out much... otherwise I would have made many more batches and ended up killing myself from overeating. Seriously though you need to try this soup. Oh and HAHAHA... good one Corwynn! For a real laugh try finding some callaloo leaves in your neighborhood. I went to 4 different grocery stores and not one staff member their management or even the professional Chef I ran into had heard of this ingredient before. Either way spinach worked out just fine. As well for those of you with limited microwave-only cooking knowledge shallots look like this: http://www.cooking.com/advice/adgloss.asp?GlossType=ingr&Item=Shallots... and salt beef is more commonly known as corned beef. Thanks goes out to my friendly neighborhood grocers for those tidbits of knowledge. Otherwise I d still be roaming the isles of the grocery store instead of being keeled over in pain from the 6 bowls of soup I just ate.",
