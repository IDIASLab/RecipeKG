Great with fish, chicken, pork, chips, or just with a spoon! This is a do ahead recipe for sure.  It taste better the next day.  Play with this salsa, I have added grapes, apples, dried cranberries, cantaloupe, honeydew melon, watermelon; just balance sweet with acid of lime or lemon. Have fun with it!",
