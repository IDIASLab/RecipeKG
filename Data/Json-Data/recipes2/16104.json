My glasses have beveled edges and it was just a few cm's above the edge so I think I'll fill it up to the edge next time. This drink was so easy and looked so beautiful. One lime will make about 8 glasses so one lime a case of soda and a bottle of grenadine makes 8 happy people!! After making this over and over and over and over I found that it's best to roll the lime before you cut it to make it really juicy. This is the perfect drink for Christmas because of the colors. Pour the grenadine in first then squeeze the lime and throw that in the grenadine this will stain the inside of the lime red and then pour the soda on top. This makes for a very FESTIVE drink!!",
