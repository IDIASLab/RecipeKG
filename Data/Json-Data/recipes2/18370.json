It was fairly expensive to make though as asparagus is about $5/bunch where I live right now.  \nI have a few suggestions to add to the recipe.  1. Oil baking pan well before putting puff pastry in.  2.  Cut venting holes or slits in the top layer of puff pastry 3.  Ten minutes was too long to cook the asparagus.  I sliced my mushrooms to around 1/4\" thick.  Next time I make this I will fry the asparagus and mushrooms in butter together no more than 5 - 7 minutes.  They have further cooking time in the oven and soggy asparagus is kind of gross.  4.  Go ahead and use all of the prepared Hollandaise sauce (just shy of 2 cups). 5.  Brush the top layer of puff pastry with a beaten egg before baking to give a nice glazed appearance to the finished product.",

For those of you who are a little more health conscious like myself an alternative to frying the asparagus in butter would be to blanch them quickly just until tender or steam them for 5-7 minutes. The mushrooms still need to be saut\u00e9d but I used about 2 Tbsp (I realise this may not seem like enough but because mushrooms give off so much liquid 2 Tbsp is all you need) of olive oil to make it healthier. Getting rid of that butter should knock off at LEAST 100 calories.",

A few tips: 1)Use an egg slicer to slice the mushrooms.  They slice easily and are uniform that way.  And 2)My puff pastry sheets were square, not long enough to cover my pan, so for the top layer, I cut into 9 strips and layed them criss-cross in a lattice design on top. It turned out great, thanks!",

I did take in the last reviews points of \"pamming\" my dish before applying the puff pastry. I didn't go the extra mile in getting fresh asparagus I used a can of asparagus tips not cooking them but layering them first on top of the pie shell and then pouring the mushroom garlic hollaindaise sauce. I also made \"vents\" for the top layer of pastry and instead of egg wash I washed the pastry with milk to give it a nice golden colour when baked. My husband enjoyed this dish very much.
