I had some canned chicken breast and I used kidney beans instead of pinto beans. Worked great. I didn't have any chili seasoning mix so I had to make one. I used this recipe http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chili-Seasoning-Mix-II/Detail.aspx which was quite aromatic even before I added it to the skillet. My wife liked this dish which is saying something and she said that our daughter who has 3 girls would like this recipe. Five stars for this one!",
