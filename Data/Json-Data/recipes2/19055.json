But then when I read the directions I realized it was for making lattes using a pot of milk and a whisk. I normally just use this tool I have called an Aerolatte to whisk the milk that I heat in the microwave. Out of curiosity I tried this method and I thought it tasted great! I even used a strong brewed coffee which I normally drink as making the espresso is time consuming and something I save for the weekend. I will more likely make it like this again as it was so easy to do.",
