I followed the recipe even using a little more seasoning than called for but it needed a little more spice for us.

I used more than a pound of chicken but less than 2 pounds; however, I used all the spice mixture. Just enough seasoning but not hot. I also used the whole can of tomatoes minus some juice and all the green chilies. This is an easy meal to prep and cook. It is perfect for when you have little time to get dinner on the table.",
