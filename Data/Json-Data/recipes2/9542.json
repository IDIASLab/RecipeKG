Cook at 190 C for 12 minutes; shake and cook for 5 more minutes. Then using the baking pan attachment add your toppings and cook at 190 C for another 8 minutes or until cheese has melted and browned. 2/24/15 The perfect pizza night solution for groups of people with different tastes and dietary needs. For years I have been looking for a gluten free pizza pulling my hair out trying to imitate real pizza crust wasting time money and patience. And here it's been all along right under my nose. I made these by putting the cooked potatoes in individual baking dishes each family member dressed their pizza the way they wanted. To think I have one kid who peels off the crusts and another who only eats \"pizza e patatine\" with this recipe everyone is happy!! Thank you What's for Dinner Mom? for your flexible crowd pleasing recipe. This is definitely going into the weekly rotation!",

If you are a fan of 'loaded fries' like we are then you'll love them too! I didn't have quite enough mozzarella so I used some cheddar too. I just topped these like I would any pizza...sauce cheese pepperoni green onions hot pepper rings and sliced black olives...the possibilities are endless!!! I used 'Exquisite Pizza Sauce' from here for the sauce and served some ranch on the side for dipping. This is one of those great little gems that you can't believe you didn't come up with yourself lol. I served this as a main dinner w/ a nice big salad and that was plenty for us! Hubby was definitely loving dinner tonight lol. I can't wait to try different pizza combinations too. Thanks WFDM for an awesome 'loaded fry' recipe and a definite keeper YUM!:)",

I was out of mozzarella cheese so I used a tomato bruschetta cheese. We enjoyed this different treat for dinner. Served it with cole slaw using 'Creamy Coleslaw Dressing' from AR.
