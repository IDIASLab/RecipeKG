I used 2% milk instead of cream, which worked out fine.  I sauteed 1 clove of garlic, minced, and about 1/4 cup chopped white onion with the carrots.  I reduced the dried seasoning amount to 1 Tbsp, even though I doubled the rest of the sauce ingredients, and I used Italian Seasoning in place of the basil and parsley.  The flavor was really intense!  I served it with plain mashed potatoes (because I added garlic to the sauce) and a good fresh baked bread.  I liked it a lot, and my husband did too. Thanks for the recipe!",
