I used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes and added a jar of marinara sauce along with the tomato paste. Instead of frozen bell pepper strips I used two fresh bell peppers cut into small strips along with a thin sliced onion. I uppped the spices a little bit added a pinch of red pepper flakes a splash of wine and a Tbsp. of brown sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. Since I'm not a huge fan of frozen meatballs I used \"Starr's Savory Meatballs\" from this site. I let this go on high for one hour and another six hours on low. Perfect with a garden salad warm bread and a glass of wine!",

I used Safeway Italian Meatballs and I also used fresh peppers. 1 green pepper sliced 1 red pepper sliced and 1 small onion sliced. I added a lot of extra seasoning....parsley basil oregano Herbs de Provence red pepper flakes garlic salt and salt and pepper to taste. I cooked mine on high for 3 hours and it turned out perfect. I served mine over mini farfalle pasta because I had some to use up. This took me less than 10 minutes to throw together and yielded some great results! Thanks for sharing!!",

I don't care for store bought frozen meatballs so I used 'Meatball Nirvana' recipe from this site and had them in the freezer ready to go. Using the frozen peppers and onions saved a lot of prep time which is awesome when you're in a hurry but still want a nice dinner. Also using PAM(R) cooking spray made clean up a breeze...a BIG plus in my book! I served this over whole grain penne for a nice healthy meal but I know the meatballs and peppers would be wonderful in a sandwich too! I did cook mine on low for 5 hours but that was my only change. If you have a favorite pasta sauce you can even use that in place of the diced tomatoes/tomato paste which is what I plan to try next time. All in all this was a HUGE hit and a definite keeper YUM YUM YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing.:)",
