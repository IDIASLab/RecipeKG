Do not separate the triangles when you remove the dough from the can. Smush the perforations together so that you have 4 rectangles. Using a pizza cutter slice the rectangles in the middle (the short way); then slice those rectangles from one corner to the opposite. Now you should have 4 smaller triangles. It makes way too much filling. I doubled the recipe and ended up with twice the amount of filling needed. I would definately make these again.",

The bottom line is this recipe lacks flavor. I made three batches of the crab mixture and it never did taste very good. I followed the recipe for my first batch and it was extremely bland. I added Worcesterhire sauce garlic powder minced onion green peppers extra cheese and crab meat to my second batch and still it lacked flavor. In my third batch I added a ton of hot sauce and that didn't help. Maybe there is just too much bread and too little crab mixture. I don't know but this recipe just didn't work for me. Sorry.",

I should note that these were devoured (I served them hot as an hor d'oeuvre) and I got tons of compliments. I made them exactly as directed with the exception of following someone else's idea of cutting the crescent rolls into smaller squares. They still turned out fairly large for \"finger foods\" so next time I'm going to cut the dough in circles fold it half and pinch the dough pierogie/ravioli style. After hearing the filling was a tad bland from my official taste-tester using the left-over filling I added a ton of Frank's Hot Sauce fresh grated parmesean cheese garlic powder and s&p. Nuked it and served it with crackers. Now this was A HIT!! I will definitely make this again but make the above changes to the filling.",
