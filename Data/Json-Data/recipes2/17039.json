My only changes were to dip the artichoke in the egg mixture, then flour, egg mixture and bread crumbs, and I seasoned them with granulated garlic and cayenne. I also served them with lemon wedges. Great recipe but not even close to 24 servings. I only wish I'd read the review that recommended serving them with garlic butter. Next time for sure!",
