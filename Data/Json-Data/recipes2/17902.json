I made this for about 10 people for dinner. (to go with hot dogs) It got nothing but rave reviews from everyone--young and old. It's not spicy (which is really good for my needs) but had a lot of flavor. My husband said this is the only chili recipe he didn't feel the need to add a bunch of ketchup to. So a success indeed. It will be making its debut at the preschool in a few weeks!!",

I have to feed 8 differant people with 8 differant tastes and sets of allergies every day and(after I substituted shallots for the garlic) even the pickiest eater loved it.
