A couple of notes:  when you are in the city and ordering a \"dog\", when they ask \"what would you like on that?\", it is appropriate to say \"hey, drag that dog through the garden, would you?\".  As far as cucumber versus dill spear, this depends on the neighborhood.  So if you always ordered at the same dog stand, you might not realize the stand about 20 miles away uses celery salt and a dill pickle.  My suggestion:  Try them wherever you go.  Oh, and my thanks to Rachel Ray - the best thing for low-carb diets...the Chicago Style Hot Dog salad.  I had these for a week when my husband was on a business trip, and I actually lost more than 5 pounds.  Thanks Vienna Beef (hey, I think their outlet store is still on Damen Ave.  Seconds are excellent!)",

For those of you having trouble finding sport peppers, they're sold by other jarred pickle/pepper products. They range from a light to dark green, and are about the size of your pinkie. They CAN be spicy, depending on your spice tolerance, check out viennabeef.com and click on products until you find the sport peppers. It is true most people (aka tourists) pick them off anyways!
