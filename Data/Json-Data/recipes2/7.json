At first bite I thought hmm this is different but then couldn't stop eating it. We ate all of the pulled out bread with that bit that wouldn't fit into the breadbowl. I took it out of the fridge 1/2 hour before company arrived as it does get a little stiff when cold. It was a great make ahead. I made the spread the day before and stuffed it in the bread bowl the following morning. Thanks for sharing. Will make again often.",

We did like it but I did add extra garlic powder and a little bit of cayenne powder. It is not something I would make again because their are other dips that I prefer more and if I'm going to eat a high fat appetizer I had better LOVE it. If you do try this out make sure and remove the paper wrap completely from the corned beef can or the gadget to open it will slip and then you are screwed. Take it from me it was not a pretty sight by the time I got my can open.",

Instead of adding just sour cream I added jalape\u00f1o sour cream. I did this because my family loves spicy. I also added the juice of 1 lime and it really boosted the flavor. I wished I had used just 1/2 of the corn beef but that s just me. I have arthritis in my hands so I used a mixer and it turned out great! This is a must try recipe I really think you ll love it!??",
