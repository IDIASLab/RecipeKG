I like that a typical stuffed pepper is no longer typical and what is usually expected. My only almost complaint is that the pepper is not quite cooked through and is still too crisp. Next time perhaps I can cover the peppers with a tent of foil for only 5-8 minutes in order to let the pepper cook just a little more but not allow the cheese to become too brown.",

I blanched the peppers in boiling water for about 10 min. then plunged in cold water. I did not add cinnamon as this seemed odd to me. I added about a half a cup of white wine with the vinegar as I felt it needed it. Next time I will use diced tomatoes as was suggested by hubby which I think would have given the dish some extra layers. It was a great inexpensive dinner by all with a tossed salad.",
