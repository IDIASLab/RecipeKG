I also used vegetable rotini because that's what I had on hand. In case my guests wanted more cheese I put some grated romano cheese on the table (which some guests used). What's great about the dish is the unique combination of flavors without the usual feeling of heaviness you find with other pasta dishes.",

I used approx a cup of feta and cheddar, and per a previous suggestion, I tossed the feta with the pasta and sauce. I also tossed in artichoke hearts.",

The kalamata olives are what really makes this dish so I wouldn't recommend substituting them unless you really dislike them.

It's like a cooked pasta salad. I substituted black olives for the Kalamata olives since they aren't my thing and to make it more mild excluded the peppers. It was a great dinner and very light and filling. I think next time I'll add more cheese though because I think at least a cup of cheddar and Feta should top it and a hint of Parmesean.",
