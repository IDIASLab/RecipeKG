We also decided this tasted better the next day, but the dressing was too strong tasting after only a couple of hours. So I tried it again with 1/2 Italian dressing and 1/2 roasted red pepper vinegret dressing.  We really liked that.  I also used red, yellow and orange bell peppers, and a couple of times a bit of avacado. I Will definitely be using the recipe regularly.\n",
