Gouda is not a traditional for cheese steak (American or provolone would be) but it's my favorite cheese in general so I went with it. The cheese sauce turned out thick and gorgeous. My fiance isn't a fan of peppers but we agreed that mushrooms would make sense as a substitute. Steak is of course always fabulous. Overall things came together really well and we look forward to making it again.",
