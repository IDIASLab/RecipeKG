I didn't have leftover of either so I just stuck some chicken in the crockpot in the morning to save a step when it was time to make dinner. It ended up moist and shredded very easily and when it cooked in the tortillas it lost the \"crockpot chicken\" taste. I think the only thing I'd change is to add just a little more cheese. You could easily add some peppers to give it a little extra kick. I'm very finicky about leftover poultry but it was delicious as leftovers too.",
