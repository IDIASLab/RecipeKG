I used four cheese Italian sausage (cooked on the grill), no green peppers and sauted the onions and garlic in EVOO, shredded monterey jack cheese instead, plus parmesan. I also used Italian seasoning, parsley, salt and pepper and basil. Still kept the oregano. To finish it I broiled it to melt the cheeses and make a slight crust on top. Wonderful! Will definitely make my own version of this recipe again!",

I used a nice marinara sauce (Rao's homemade) which was a little pricier but worth the cost since the marinara is pretty important to the overall flavor of the dish. I did make a few minor additions: added some salt pepper and chili pepper.",
