I didn't marinate overnight. I only marinated for 3 hours. This was *perfect*. When it came time for the mayo, I used 1/2 a cup rather than the whole cup. So glad I did this. I think the full cup of mayo would have been enough to overpower the dressing. Once I added the last ingredients in, I put it back in the fridge for another hour or so. We all really enjoyed this. I'll be making it again, for certain!",

Then before serving, topped with fresh chopped chives and parsley from my garden. Also, I used real bacon bits and used freshly grated parmesan! I made a second batch and used shredded yellow extra sharp cheese, and used white sweet onion instead of the red....sensational!! I am amazed and shocked that cauliflower can taste so good prepared this way! Note: Save drained dressing for another use. Also, very important.....reserve a few TBS. of the dressing to add to mayo! It adds a special zesty kick!! Adding minced garlic from a jar makes this extra super delicious for you garlic lovers!! And you can marinate this for as long as you like! Two-Three days is perfect! The base for this cauliflower would make a perfect pasta salad!",

Three out of four of us thought this was really good--I actually ate the rest as a snack last night. Next time I might try to make this lighter using part nonfat greek yogurt in place of some of the mayonnaise. NOTE: The longer it sits the better it tastes--if you have time try to make this as early as you can before you have to serve it.",
