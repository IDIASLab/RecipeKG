I wasn't real sure about it at first...but once we had a finished product it was delicious. I cooked mine in a cast iron pan would have been real dicey to have grilled them (as mine were about to fall apart). Husband really liked them...will definitely keep playing with the amount of hot sauce and worcestershire to get the right mix. Thanks for sharing!",
