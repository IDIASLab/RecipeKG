Too many reviewers commented on the chicken being overdone so my solution was to grill the chicken (I undercooked it slightly) then I chopped it up and added it into the mix at the end with the tomatoes and peas. I also slightly undercooked my pasta (whole wheat) and added that into the sauce before I added in the tomatoes onions and chicken. This helped the pasta to really take on the flavors of the sauce and helped to thicken the sauce. Everyone had seconds!",

Did you let it cook down for 15 minutes as recommended? This concentrates the favors--thickening it would have made it too dry as well as blander. The second time I made this I didn't have any white wine so I substituted sweet white vermouth. It's cheap but difficult to find in the States and not very popular so I don't know how many of you have any but if you do try it! The spices in the vermouth subtly enhanced the flavor of this dish to whole new levels. Wowza!",
