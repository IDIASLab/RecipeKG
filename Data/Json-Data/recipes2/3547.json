Unfortunately I had a problem because the prosciutto I bought claimed to be thin slices but was really more like thin tatters--I had to made a kind of patchwork of it to wrap the chicken. This meant that I couldn't tuck the ends in and all the cheese melted and ran out. The chicken was also overcooked at 40 minutes so next time I will try 5-10 minutes less. Even so the flavor was good and I'll try it again with the right kind of prosciutto slices. I used dried sage instead of chives and no chipotle.",
