This is a variation on a typical 3-way which would be chili-spaghetti-cheese, now it's chili-rice-cheese.  Be sure to put a bottle of hot sauce on the table because that's also mandatory for many folks (I'm one of them).  I now live in Florida, but I still have a Skyline Chili within driving distance which I visit at LEAST monthly.  I'm still a chilihead, and this recipe definitely measures up!!",
