        "description": "So very rich, perfect, and healthy. Made with any organic nut butter of choice. Great with almond butter, peanut butter, you name it! We think better than the old fashioned PB cookie even. I find the dark chocolate chips at our local Co-Op health food stores. They even have some made with stevia if you like to be even lower in the sugars. This is a fast easy recipe sure to please! Keeps well in fridge or freezer best. I like mine micro-waved a few seconds for that fresh warm cookie with melted chocolate goodness.",

The smell coming from the oven gave a strong almond aroma, but when you eat them they are surprisingly delicate in flavor. A nice, subtle surprise. I imagine with any other nut butter the flavor would be different, and definitely worth the try (especially cashew butter). This is not your regular peanut butter cookie. These are chewy thanks to the almond flour, get your milk ready, they dunk well. Simple to put together too. Nice recipe, thanks for sharing it with us.",

I think it would be better to mix the dry ingredient together, then add the egg beaten w/ vanilla, then the nut butter. If you try to just dump all into a bowl it is difficult to fully incorporate all the ingredients. This would be good with peanut butter. I used a 12 oz jar of almond butter. I pressed each cookie w/ a fork tine, then sprinkled on some sugar.",
