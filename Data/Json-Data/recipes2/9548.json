These fry up real nice and melt in your mouth as soon as you bite down. Unfortunately I discovered that I do not like Camembert cheese. It was SO sour cream tasting to me. No fault of the recipe though I just don't care for the cheese. Hubby did enjoy them and because I only ate one there ended up being leftovers. He said that he thought they were less sour and better then next day so take that for what it is worth. The cranberry sauce is a must!",
