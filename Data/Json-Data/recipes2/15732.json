First off, I used fresh horseradish from the root.  I simply used 1/2 cup of peeled and diced horseradish place in a food processor and processed with 1/4 cup of white wine vinegar and 1 tsp. sugar and a pinch of salt.  It was processed until it was pureed.  If you do not like fresh you can just use prepared horseradish in this step.  However, I feel that the freshness adds to the flavor.  In a small bowl, I then used 2 TBSP of the prepared horseradish above and added the 2tbsp of low-fat mayo.  My hubby does not like sour cream so I used one \"triangle\" of laughing cow light swiss cheese and creamed it in really well.  Then proceeded with cayenne pepper. We used this as a spread on our sandwiches.  I'm sure if you wanted it as a sauce you can simply thin it out with milk or heavy cream.  Thanks for sharing this recipe as it was a basis to a wonderful spread! ",

With her head's up I decided to prepare this first without the vinegar with the thought that I could always add it later.  She was right - I'm so glad I didn't add it, as it was tangy enough without.  Other reviewers who added more horseradish were right on too.  This was on the subtle side, so I nearly doubled it. The ground red pepper (I assume that meant cayenne) didn't appeal to me so I skipped it. I used full fat sour cream and mayonnaise.  With a fair amount of tinkering this turned out ok, but I much prefer \"Creamy Horseradish Garlic Spread,\" also from this site.",
