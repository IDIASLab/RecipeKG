I used Nestle white chocolate chips, and they didn't melt so well so I ended up having to add shortening to them. Otherwise this was fairly simple, a little fussy but worth the effort for cute little shark teeth! Happy Shark Week!",

Hers were almost identical, except she used milk chocolate and only dipped the large end of the Bugle, so you could see the actual Bugle's color, but not the peanut butter inside.  Perfect melody of salt and sweetness with a little crunch.  Love these!! (never tried with white chocolate).",

Love how they turned out but I did end up using almost a 14 oz bag of bugles to use all the peanut butter and I needed 35 ounces of chocolate to cover them.  Perhaps if the bugles were opened wide rather than having a narrow opening the recipe amounts would have been perfect.",
