I also added taco meat. It was very easy to assemble. I do think it was a bit heavy on the bean flavor. My family thought it was decent and they didn't use sour cream or salsa on it like I did. I ate the leftovers cold and really liked that. My biggest complaint was that the pizza crust tasted \"biscuit\" like. I will try another brand next time or make my own pizza dough.",
