Blanching the green beans before finishing them off in the skillet served to preserve their vibrant green color and made them perfectly crisp-tender. I finished cooking the beans in the skillet together with the shallots and garlic as I didn't want to take a chance of overcooking them. I added some chopped red pepper for color and eye appeal and finished them with a drizzle of toasted sesame oil. I forgot the sesame seeds darn it but these were so good we didn't even miss them. These weren't \"spicy \" as indicated in the title but they sure were good and truly stood apart from your everyday green beans!",

This will be my new method, with the addition of Sriracha. For the record, I subbed (liberally) soy sauce for the salt in this recipe, and that probably made a big difference. Be sure to take a paper towel or clean kitchen towel to your freshly-drained green beans BEFORE adding them to your hot oil, or you'll throw grease splash-back onto yourself. Drying them also helps them to blister and brown like they're supposed to (instead of steam and mush, like they are not supposed to). I wish the instructions included that step, because it's a standard cautionary procedure (never add water to hot oil, etc.) but I don't fault the recipe for that. Thank you for sharing your recipe!",
