My husband who swore the only clams he likes are when they're in clam chowder smelled it cooking and stole a bite or two when it was done. He said it was good. Instead of using oil I chopped up a piece of thick pepper bacon and then fried 1/4 of an onion (chopped) with it. I just couldn't see adding a whole onion to that little can of clams. Also since I'm on a low-carb diet I used parmesan cheese instead of bread crumbs. I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used powdered (which just isn't the same!) I also used rosemary instead of thyme 'cause that's all I had. It only filled two ramekins but that may be because I didn't use the amount of onion called for I drained some of the clam juice and I only used 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese for the bread crumbs. It was pretty good but I don't see myself making it again unless I happen to have chopped clams on hand.",
