The recipe doesn't say to defrost the peaches, but I had some concerns about frozen peaches releasing water in the baking dish, so I defrosted them. The recipe author says \"if you prefer to use brown sugar, use the same amount as the replacement.\" I used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, and you use half the amount of brown sugar, so just a word of caution if you don't use the substitute.  This had just the right amount of sweetness for us, takes no time to make, and you can enjoy this dessert without guilt.  Thanks, libton, for a yummy, quick and easy dessert.",

As per other reviewers I used fresh (Ontario) peaches regular brown sugar and doubled the vanilla. I'm guessing the better the peaches (and ripeness) the better the flavour. We did serve this in individual heatproof greased crocks (for quicker baking and serving) with a dollop of french vanilla ice cream and a side of cinnamon walnut coffee cake. I also made two other individual servings using artificial sweetener (used different small crocks to differentiate); I should have dissolved in melted butter first as the powder didn't dissolve during the baking process although the two guests that had those enjoyed them after stirring it up a bit.",
