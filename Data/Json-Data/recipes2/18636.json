I did make a couple of changes and additions to it to suit my tastes... and I have literally been asked to make at least 8 copies of this recipe from friends co-workers and family. I had read from previous reviews that it had a tendacy to turn out watery so I added between 6-8 oz of cream cheese to thicken it up. I also added 1 fresh jalepeno pepper and a handful of radishes for texture.. I also tripled or more the cilantro called for. When this is refridgerated it thickens up nicely due to the cream cheese. I started using this on St. Patrick's day for a party when I needed to bring a green appetizer and served it with guacamole green corn chips and breaded fried asparagus pieces... Since I have brought it to work for \"dip day\" several times and made it at home. It has become a hit already and EVERYONE wants the recipe and loves it!!!",

I had some good chipotle salsa. Added red onion for color instead of green. This is a nice change of pace. I kept it more chunky to eat more as a sidedish. Only added some salt and a little lime juice. The chipotle was a very hot salsa so didn't need any more heat factor. Maybe the key is to use a better salsa.",

We're big guacamole fans and I make it often but this is just the sort of change my taste buds needed! I made several changes but kept the basics of the recipe- I didn't have any salsa left so I just used a half a medium tomato a dash of vinegar and the juice of half a lime to cover the salsa flavors. I also added some ground sea salt and some ground cayenne pepper. I omitted the garlic. And as I typically do with my own guac recipe I added a small squirt of honey. But I did taste it before I made all those changes and I still LOVED it! You can hardly even tell that it's asparagus- which my husband is a fan of (since he's not usually a fan of asparagus). Awesome! Perfect with chips and a cold beer! I can't wait to serve this to guests!",
