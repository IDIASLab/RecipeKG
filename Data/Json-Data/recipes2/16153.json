Kiwi is such a beautiful fruit it was a shame to use it in this shake where it basically contributed nothing except an off taste to water down the strawberry flavor and to cast a weird color to what would otherwise have been a pretty pink. It wasn't sweet enough either. I added honey which helped a little but the taste was still off. In desperation I threw in a banana. Saved.",
