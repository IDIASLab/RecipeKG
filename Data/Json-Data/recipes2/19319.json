The texture was not very.pleasant either. Kinda slimy. My suggestion would be to.serve them seperately (the melon & prosciutto). Thank u anyway!",

As a matter of fact tomorrow evening we have friends coming for supper staying overnight and having breakfast before continuing their journey home. I'm serving this as a light starter followed by Chicken with Capers/Cream Sauce Garlic Smashed Potatoes French Green Beans and fresh Asparagus; no dessert but double cream Brie with green grapes and fresh raspberries.
