I did not have any cornflakes and could not get to the store so I used crushed cheez-it crackers (the cheddar/parmesan duo variety). Also I used only half the amount of butter and 1 egg white. Overall the chicken was a bit salty but I think that was because I used the crackers instead of cornflakes. If I did it the same way again I would omit the garlic salt and replace it with garlic powder. I also cooked it on a rack placed on top of a baking sheet so the bottom would not get soggy. It worked pretty well. I will definitely make this again.",

In my case I did not have the cornflakes so I did the next best that I could do and used Special K cereal instead. I really am not a fan of too much salt so I did swap the salt for garlic powder. When it said creole seasoning I figured I could used Bayou blast by Emeril. The only thing I probably missed was on the cheddar I sprinkled it on top...this was tasty and I can't wait to make it again! I put a quick meal together by using a fettucini alfredo noodle packet then added in some bayou blast to give it a cajun kick I served it w/ veggies and garlic bread. Thanks for sharing!",

I also turned chicken 1/2 way through cooking but didn't find it helped all that much to crisp the other side. My breasts took about 30 minutes to bake and were perfect.",

The bottom of the chicken (even though I flipped it half way through) was a little mushy but the top stayed crunchy. I have made these a few times since first trying this. I may one day try it with the corn flakes but I was so happy with the Ritz that I may not. Thanks for the recipe!!!",
