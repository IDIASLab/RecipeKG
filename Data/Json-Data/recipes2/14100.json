For the person that thought they weren't flat enough you should be able to make them as flat or as round as you like when you shape the cakes. They are not going to flatten more when you cook them. They will also hold together better if you refrigerate the cakes before cooking.",

I used the seasoned bread crumbs, they were a little salty, may try the plain next time. I would definitely make them for company. These cakes are so easy to make. The canned crab meat is good. I fried them in butter, and we ate them plain, but they would be good with tartar sauce, also. Thank you! A delicious & easy-to-make dinner, I searched with french fries & coleslaw!",
