The chicken was a little overcooked after being cooked fully before cooking the last 10 minutes. Next time I would probably not cook chicken completely before covering.",

I was leary of the ranch dressing and orange but it worked very well together. The sauce was quite thick so instead of stirring the cornstarch directly into the sauce I chose to stir it into more of the broth then added it to the pan. Next time I will cut the chicken into smaller pieces to shorten the cooking time and allow the chicken to cook more evenly. This is definitely a keeper!",
