A cup of diced tomato - a green tomato would be great. 2 slices of bacon chopped into 1/4 pieces. Small yellow onion fine diced. 5 total cloves of smashed garlic - not 3. Skip the tarragon add a sprig of extra Rosemary AND a small hand of parsley plus 5 sprigs worth of thyme - all chopped fine. Use calamata olives for God's sake. Use the suggested amount of chicken stock but add equal portion of lamb stock if you can - reduce by half under a slow simmer. Red pepper flakes salt and fresh ground pepper to taste. Assemble as directed in original recipe. For extra magic - add a splash of red wine vin. a table spoon of balsamic and squeeze half a lemon in. All this acid helps brake down and blend the favors in addition to adding a brightness that makes everything POP!",

I made some changes - I used only 2 cans of beans no spinach substituted half as many kalamata olives instead of black olives better flavor and threw in a tablespoon of capers and half cup pearl couscous to help thicken it up. Still it's the same basic idea and my husband and sons were happy. Next time I think I'll double the garlic and rosemary.",
