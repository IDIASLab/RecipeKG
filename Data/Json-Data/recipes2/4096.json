I took another reviews suggestion and marinated the chicken in the ranch for a few hours before cooking (mostly because it was easy to do that during nap time) and I added season salt, creole seasoning, pepper, and garlic to the chicken after the dressing and before the bread crumbs.  I sprayed the pan with pam instead of oil and had no problem with sticking.  My husband says this is a keeper recipe :-)",
