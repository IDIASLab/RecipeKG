The amount of chicken listed as two chicken breasts should be 8-10 oz of chicken breast total I think. Then I cooked the chicken breasts first by boiling them in some water until cooked and then diced it. I was nice as the meat shredded into the sauce. I also cooked the chorizo separately before putting it in the mix. It browned nicely. The chorizo I got had roughly diced meat so after browning it I placed it through the food processor to make a finer chop. I served it with both tortilla chips and soft corn tortillas as well as guacamole and sour cream. My guests enjoyed it tremendously. Some of them even made quesadillas with it.",

The chicken broth melted it into a perfect consistency without it burning all over the sides of the pan and it only took minimal stirring. I love mushrooms but they really seemed out of place in this recipe to me and so I left them out. I also left out the 8oz. of cheddar in the end. I had it but it just wasn't necessary and that is why I am giving this a 4 instead of 5 star rating. The consistency was perfect after the chicken was added and it would have been entirely too thick if the additional cheese would have been added. Overall this was delicious but I recommend eating in small doses due to the amount of sodium.",
