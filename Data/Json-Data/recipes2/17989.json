We also added a drained can of Albacore chunk tuna, since the one packet of salmon just didnt seem like it would make enough as a light lunch for my girl, son, and I.  It made 12-14 golf ball shapes of varying size, and she rolled them in crushed Ritz cracker-with-a-bit-of-cornmeal coating (appx 1/4 c cornmeal, 15 crackers) in lieu of wheat germ.  I didnt add dill, though I'm sure that would have been amazing - just didn't have any.  Instead, we threw in a couple shakes of Mrs Dash Zesty - like a Cajun seasoning.  I also just diced up one celery stick and picked off a long green onion from my window plant - so we probably used over a 1/4 cup for each.  Both kids (ages 8, 6) LOVED it.  They dipped in cold Ranch dressing.  My girl said, \"These salmon crock-ettes change my mood!\"  She still cant remember how to say \"croquette\" LOL  Definitely a keeper recipe!",
