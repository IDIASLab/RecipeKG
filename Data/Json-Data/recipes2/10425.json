About 2 medium ones that I chopped and took the pulp out of.  I also added 2 tablespoons of TACO seasoning mix. This gave it a nice flavor. You can also substitute with cumin if you'd like.  I omitted the oil and the avocado.  I added about 1/4 cup of chopped jalapeno in.  I let it sit over night so the flavors could marinate really well.  With the leftovers I made black bean quesadillas the next day adding cheddar cheese to the tortillas.   Will make again !!",
