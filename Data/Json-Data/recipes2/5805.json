Or you can make cheese less watery but I didn't find this step in the recipe description. finally I made cookies but I didn't use hands to roll balls (because of watery dough) I just scooped the batter with a spoon onto a cookies sheet. Well they don't have such a beautiful round form but taste good and smell lemon lime?? I didn't make the glaze because the cookies didn't turn as I expected.",
