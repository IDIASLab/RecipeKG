My can opener broke so I did could not use tomato sauce and subbed with ketchup instead. Also I used my own home-made sofrito (FIVEBRIGS recipe on this site). I did not have olives so omitted it. I know this is not traditional but I love potatoes and carrots with this beef so I added some diced pieces to the pot during last 30 min of cooking. Word of caution braising the beef caused a lot of smoke and oil splatter. Not sure if this step is necessary. Also if your pot gets black at the bottom like mine did after cooking the beef deglaze with some wine or water and clean with a paper towel and you're in business again. I paired this with Puerto Rican steamed rice by FIVEBRIGS on this site. Also had the Goya frozen maduros but will make my own next time.",

They nailed this meat stew!\" I actually had nearly all of the Goya products on hand except I had several ice-cubes' worth of frozen homemade Sofrito that needed to be used. Left out the capers (can't stand 'em) and after browning the steak and sauteeing the veggies I tossed everything in the crock-pot on low for 8 hrs. About half-way thru I removed the steak and shredded it and added a much heavier handful of cilantro (c'mon Goya - 1 TB??) prior to serving. My husband ate his (scooped w/ a slotted spoon) in a corn tortilla while I ate mine slurpy-soupy-style. The flavor isn't intense but it's unusual enough that I would definitely make this again although I think next time I would consider adding some sweet potatoes or some kind of additional veggie for more stew-ey substance along w/ a diced chipotle or jalapeno for a little blaze.",

So during the last half hour as I was shredding the beef I let the sauce simmer to thicken up and gain flavor (I didnt want a soupy texture) and it came out great. I also used a large beef broth goya cube. AND BTW this recipe doesnt mention which sofrito to use. Theres a cilantro based and a tomato based. I used a little bit of both but since there was already a tomato flavor from the tomato sauce the cilantro is fine since you should add some fresh cilantro anyway at the end.

Served with cilantro rice, some Puerto Rican-style beans, and a bacalao salad (my pops-in-law is from San Juan, PR so I learned to cook a lot of Puerto Rican food).\n\nAlso, I'd like to correct a previous comment: There's only ONE sofrito (it's the red, tomato-based cooking base). The green, culantro-based cooking base is called RECAITO (which is what I used for the rice). Side note, culantro is NOT the same as cilantro, nor is it used to describe cilantro-culantro is an herb I associate with pho because it's part of the veg/herb plate that comes with a bowl of",
