First we seasoned the ground beef with Crazy Jane's Mixed Up Salt.We cooked the patties on the bbq adding a thin slice of cheddar cheese toward the end. The buns were toasted on the grill also.The burger bar consisted of lettuce home grown tomatoes & red onions (sliced) cooked bacon sauted mushrooms (seasoned with Crazy Jane's) sliced avocado dijon mustard & mayo & this wonder chipotle sauce. It gave the burger a nice kick. Our daughter never eats everything on her plate. Her husband usually eats her leftovers. Tonight she ate every bite. Wow what a wonderful dinner!",

What I did was buy a can of \"San Marcos\" Chipotle Peppers in Adobe Sauce. I ran them through the food processor. Then I covered a mini-muffin pan with plastic wrap and spooned equal amounts into each of the 12 cups. If you do the math that is just over a tablespoon per cup. Toss the tray in the freezer when it is frozen just roll up the plastic wrap put in a pint storage bag and throw it back in the freezer. My next try will be simply to melt one of these cubes in a cup of Ranch dressing. I think that will be closer to what I am looking for. (Then I will go for the lime juice cumin etc.)",
