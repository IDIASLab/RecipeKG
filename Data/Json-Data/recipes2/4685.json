I did cut the filets lengthwise so we could get more of that crunchy goodness all over. Next time I would salt and pepper the filets before I dipped them but otherwise PERFECTION!!! Crispy, crunchy (NOT greasy) with flaky and tender mild fish. Sparky has already asked for a repeat SOON.  Thanks for sharing this stellar fish recipe!",

By the time the fish was cooked through the breading was almost too crispy. The smaller pieces were perfect. I would do 1 inch x 2 inch strips next time. I also used the same breading with Flounder instead of Halibut (for my kids.....Halibut is too expensive to buy enough for them.) It was delicious too! And took less time to cook. Overall a recipe definitely worth making!!",
