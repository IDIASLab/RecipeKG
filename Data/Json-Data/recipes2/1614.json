Fortunately, I used frozen corn and the little bit of moisture from that was enough to turn the dough lump into a smooth paste. The stiff whipped egg whites folded in nicely and the fritter had a really nice loft. I used to work in an old Chinese take-out restaurant, and the smell of these frying reminded my strongly of egg foo-yung. The flavor was pretty good, and the fritters developed a nice, thin crust. Not crunchy, but there was texture. I wish I had some scallions to slice and add to the fritter batter. I did add about 2 tablespoons of fresh, chopped dill weed, and a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder (too lazy to mince 2 cloves). Overall, we liked this recipe.",
