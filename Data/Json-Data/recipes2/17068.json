I've been away form home, and although i made this with my mom for years at home, I could not remember the recipe. So, I called up Mom who says: use 3 cans of evaporated milk and 1 to 1 1/2 cans condensed milk depending on how sweet u like it. Also, add the rum sparingly depending on your own tastes. Finally, when beating the eggs, add the peel of one lemon (helps to cut the freshness of the raw egg). Serve with lots of ice  :)",

I balked at using raw eggs so I put the eggs in a ceramic bowl and placed the bowl in a pot of boiling water. I let them stew for a few minutes. They didn't cook all the way but enough to pasteurize them for a bit about 5 minutes. The eggs took on a \"custardly\" feel and then I used them as the Punch Cream recipe called for. Tasted great and I felt much better sharing it with others knowing the eggs weren't totally raw.",
