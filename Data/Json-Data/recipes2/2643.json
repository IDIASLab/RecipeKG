The simple combination of peppery radishes, toasted walnuts, and fresh mint is satisfying and somehow greater than the sum of its parts. It is prettiest when served immediately and tastes great with roasted meats and hearty grain salads. If you have leftovers, try tucking them into toasted pitas with a little goat cheese or feta.",

I also think that this needed more lemon juice than called for but that's my personal preference. I did use dried mint (I dried my fresh mint from the garden last year) but that was my only change. We love radishes and this was a nice new way to enjoy them. I may try this again and tweak a few things. Thanks for sharing.:)",

Because of time I only made roughly a third or the recipe. We were both thrilled.The fresh combination of strong radish, fresh lemon, mint, combined with the wonderful textures made this a winner in my kitchen.\nI had two left over scallions that I chopped up and added in because I was cutting back on the salt in the recipe, and it ended it coming out great! I would have never thought of combining walnuts with radishes but it really worked. \nI know we will be getting more radishes at the farmers market and this is a delicious salad!",
