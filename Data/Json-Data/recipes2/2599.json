I only wished that I'd been able to roll out the dough a bit more to get a swirled/pinwheel effect when slicing. Simply couldn't get it rolled out any wider it just kept springing back so I just filled sealed and baked it. Before filling the bread I cut it in half served one today and froze the other one for later. The melted apricot preserves really complement the bread's filling. Very quick & easy to make and tasty.",
