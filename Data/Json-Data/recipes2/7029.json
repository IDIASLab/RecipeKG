However this was a nice change and as my daughter said it would be great as a side dish for a steak or even a burger. I too as another wasn't sure of the mixture working together but it really does. Just made this a second time for you blue cheese lovers I really think this is one to try. Was going to make corn on the cob today with my ribs but my daughter wanted this again so here we are. Yum",
