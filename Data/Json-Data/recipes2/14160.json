We played aroung with it and used 2 cans sweetened condensed milk , 1 can crushed pineapple, and a 2 liter bottle of orange soda and it was a huge hit. People who do not even like orange ice cream were raving over it , and at the end of the night we had to run the kids away from the freezer because they were taking turns licking the spinner in the ice cream freezer. Will make again for sure!!!!!",

I will certainly try it again but tweak it just a little. I also used fat free condensed milk and diet sunkist to keep it low-cal and low-fat",
