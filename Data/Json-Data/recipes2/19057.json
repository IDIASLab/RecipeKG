I add 2 Tablespoons brown sugar 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and a handful of raisins to each and then freeze. At breakfast remove from bag put in a bowl and microwave for 1 minute.

It's quick easy healthy and if you have the brown rice you'll most likely have the other main ingredients on hand. I did not have blueberries so instead I chopped up some walnuts & threw them in. I put in maybe 3 dashes of cinnamon and doubled the honey. Depending on what you add in you may want to adjust the sweetness. My family really loved this. Some of us added in fresh strawberries too. I added in the egg but it was creamy enough even before I added the egg. I think it would be great both w/ or w/o the egg. I've posted a photo of this...",

I don't like Oatmeal but I do enjoy some of the other hot breakfast cereals (e.g. farina cream of rice cream of wheat etc.). At the same time it just never occurred to me (after 35 years of cooking for a family of 5!!!!) to use my own rice (or last night's leftovers even) in order to \"present\" a nourishing breakfast. This recipe is GREAT!!! You start with the rice and then add whatever else you (and/or your family members) enjoy (for instance banana strawberries perhaps even grapes or raisins instead of blueberries; dried apricots peaches or prunes are also considerations also). IMHO the VANILLA and CINNAMON are \"MUSTS\". As is the BUTTER. But after that just \"fly\" (molasses white or brown sugar maple -- or any other flavor -- syrup rather than honey; homogenized milk heavy or light cream half-and-half etc. rather than 2% etc. etc. etc.). My family members are Ruby Red Grapefruit Juice drinkers so that's what I've been using as our \"side\". But orange apple grape prune juice etc. or any one of the available \"blends\" would be appropriate too; as would be a glass of milk. Thank you thank you thank you cherry007 for your contribution. My family is eating BREAKFAST again!",

The first time I used low sugar pancake syrup (it's what I had) frozen mixed berries instead of dried fruit and omitted the spices and vanilla because I had none. The second time I used regular sugar lots of cinnamon a little nutmeg and 1/4 c dried pineapple. I skipped the egg and added salt both times. I love this recipe and will be making it for breakfast every day until I run out of rice and every time thereafter that I have brown rice. A quick note: There is a big difference in taste between using sweet fruits and tart fruits so you may have to adjust the amount of sugar you put in depending on what fruit you use. The pineapple might have actually been okay without any sugar but I had to add a lot of syrup to the porridge with the 1 cup of frozen berries.",

Not only is it really cheap to make but it uses low-calorie/on hand ingredients to make a hearty warm breakfast.
