Marinate in the refrigerator for at least an hour or up to 3 hours but no longer than 3 hours total. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil then place a rack on top. Spray the rack with cooking spray. Drain the marinade from the beef tips then add the beef tips to the baking rack leaving some space in between so they roast evenly. Roast for 15 minutes then place under the broiler for 3-4 minutes to crisp up the edges. Remove the beef to a serving bowl then pour any juices from the bottom of the baking sheet over the beef tips.",
