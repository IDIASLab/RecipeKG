When I filled the steak and rolled them I had so much filling leftover that I decided to use that in the gravy too. So I deglazed my pan with some red wine and added my canned gravy to the filling mixture. It made a great sauce for the finished product. Also to my potatoes I added some dried minced onions some parsley flakes and some grated parmesan to give it some additional flavor. This was a great dinner and I love how quick and easy these potatoes are to make!",

I actually realized when it was too late to go to the store that I was out of bell pepper and I ended up doubling the mushroom instead and it was still delicious. I had never used canned gravy before- ever- but it was tasty and a timesaver for sure and it really worked nicely to pull together the steak and potatoes. I really loved how nicely the potatoes turned out both the flavor and texture were great. Thanks to those short cuts I was able to pull this together for my family on a busy weeknight and make everyone's taste buds happy!",
