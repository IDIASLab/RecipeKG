I had about 1/2 of a 20 oz. package of fresh tortellini left that I needed to do something with and this recipe fit the bill. I didn't have any pepperoni so I substituted some small cubed German proscuitto that I had picked up at Aldi. I also didn't want to open a whole can of black olives so I used Kalamata olives that I had already opened. I did follow the recipe for the rest just kind of eye-balling the ingredients to match the amount of tortellini that I had. It was delicious and my daughter was happy to take the left overs in her lunch today.",

Now Imm asked to bring it to all family functions.  I do adjust it a little now- I add halved grape tomatoes and use both mozzarella and provolone as well as pepperoni and salami- and I try to add a little less dressing.  Always make it a day ahead to let the flavors blend.  And I always have to double it.  Great recipe!",
