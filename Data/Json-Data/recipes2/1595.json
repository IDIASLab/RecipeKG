Even though I used cold fruit, the smoothie came out lukewarm, so next time I would either freeze the fruit ahead of time, or add a few ice cubes. In addition, if you're making just 1 serving, I found it kind of inconvenient to only be using 1/4 of each fruit, then having to wrap everything up to store leftovers. If you're going to freeze your fruit ahead of time though, it'd be easy enough to cut everything ahead of time and freeze it.",
