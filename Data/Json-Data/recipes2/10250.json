I like a little spice in my life and would probably add some jalapeno. I also wasn't able to find a traditional biscuit dough so I had to use the layered biscuits which have a lot of sugar. Maybe I'd bake my own next time. Ultimately it's a good breakfast or it would be great for Brunch. Enjoy",

I used as much salt as I d normally add to scrambled eggs which is likely not even one teaspoon). However I missed the review that said 1/2 hr baking was long enough. So essentiallyafter 45 min the entire bottom was overdone and had to be thrown to the birds:(. The part not over cooked was admittedly tasty. Overall the casserole had great potential but not worth the effort when biscuits and gravy with hash and eggs on a plate would take about 15 min to make.",

I used 4 eggs instead of 6 as it was all I had on hand and there are only 4 of us. I only cooked it for 35 minutes (after the 5 minutes for the biscuits alone) and it was perfectly done (my oven gets really hot really quickly.) I don't think I'd ever fix it for actual breakfast because of how many dishes it took and I work night shift - I'm just not cleaning that many that early lol.
