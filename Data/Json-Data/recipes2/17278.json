Used a combination of white and yellow cheddar and red & yellow bell peppers. The crushed buttery crackers really bring richness. Didn't like the idea of a mushroom sauce so I skipped it with no sacrifice to flavor IMO. If I were to add a sauce I think a hollandaise would be tasty on this. Enjoyed today for lunch with a small side salad and some fruit. Definitely would make this again!",
