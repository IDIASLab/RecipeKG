The family was skeptical of the hot dog buns but after the first bite all anyone could think of was how much those buns were transformed. Nobody thought it was too sweet or rich and the whole pan was gobbled up within 24 hours. I liked the addition of nutmeg; it really added something special and it was evident in the final product. Some variations I may try: Adding booze to the chocolate marshmallow sauce (maybe some rum or bourbon) replacing the graham crackers with Teddy Grahams or Nilla Wafers. The possibilities are endless!
