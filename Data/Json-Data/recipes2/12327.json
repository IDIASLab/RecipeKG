Had again tonight for a light supper and made a few variations as to some fresh veggies I needed to use before I left town. I added fresh sliced tomatoes thin slices of a sweet onion basil from my garden and a handful of fresh spinach I had left on a whole wheat bagel. Very tasty and refreshing whether as written or using your own variations. Thanks for the recipe idea for a light and healthy alternative to a burger.",
