The reason why I made this is because I wanted a soft spread that I could add minced garlic and chopped parsley to for homemade garlic bread. This was exactly what I was looking for. I did use SALTED butter. I was able to mix this up around noon (with the added spices) and use to spread on garlic bread at dinnertime. It blew my mind. Who knew that homemade soft spread would be this easy to make and without chemicals? I'm really impressed. I'll use this recipe again for sure. NOTE: Twelve servings (1/3 cup of both salted butter and 1/3 cup oil) makes enough to spread on two sides of one large italian bread loaf. I only used half, there's plenty for next time I make garlic bread.",

I made the full recipe with some added salt since my butter was unsalted.  The taste is good and i would make it again.  The recipe yielded around 2 cups.  Thanks Cal for a good recipe that replaces store bought junk. UPDATE:  My initial batch eventually separated.  So I adjusted the second batch.  I defrosted 2 sticks of butter in my 1300w microwave for 39sec.  The butter was very soft and partially melted.  I put the butter in the KA with the whisk attachment and whisked it until it was smooth.  I added a total of 1cup of canola oil with the first half added very slowly.  This time I added 4 pinches of table salt.  UPDATE:  The spread did not separate when i used my updated method. Update:  I whipped it longer this time so the spread is white and I made 2.5 cups instead of 2c.  Will update with results.",

I have reduced butter usage in everyday cooking for cholesterol reasons. The only 2 options available at the market that are not margarine are whipped butter and butter with canola oil. Whipped butter is just butter with air whipped into it which reduces the sat fat by half by doubling the volume. They are only selling half the amount of butter too!The butter with canola oil at the grocery store is over 3.50 for 15oz. \"This recipe tastes and spreads exactly like that butter.\" Stick butter cost about 65 cents a stick which makes this more affordable. I just put two sticks of butter in the empty clean 15oz container for the same products. I microwaved the butter about 25-30 seconds until softened and not melted and then followed the directions for adding the canola oil to it. Make sure to use salted butter or add a little salt. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!",

But for everyday butter to put on the table I still prefer the whipped butter sold at the store. One thing that I really don't like about it is how quickly it starts to separate at room temperature. Having oil puddle around the corners of the butter dish isn't very appetizing. I've read the reviews and this could be a result of too much canola oil but as I try to do I followed the recipe exactly as written the first time. Nutritionally the two are very close and yes whipped butter does take a few minutes to soften (but not long). And there is very little cost savings making this as compared to buying the store brand of whipped butter. If it works for you go for it but I'll be sticking with the whipped butter. This will be eaten and it was worth a try.",
