I used 1 TEASPOON Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt the called for amount would have made this dish inedible. The recipe makes more than enough filling even after piling the mushrooms high (and scooping out a sizable amount of the inside of the mushroom as the recipe called for) there was extra. I'm not complaining though- I could (and did!) eat this stuff with a spoon. I ended up having to bake these for 10 minutes more than the recipe called for in order to get the mushroom to cook and I probably could have left them in longer. In the future I think I would increase the baking temperature to 400. All of that being said the filling is REALLY tasty this is definitely a keeper!",
