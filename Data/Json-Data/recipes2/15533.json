We'll fry the sliced leftover dumplings for breakfast. \r\nMy mother used to add a cube of Salami, instead of the croutons. It was the surprise for us, since meat was scarce in those days.",

I was trying to recrete this dish I had in a German restaurant that was Goulasch with potato dumplings.  The recreation wasn't anything like the restaurants but my husband LOVED it and even my picky four year old pronounced it good.  I didn't have any mashed potatoes so I baked four potatoes, scooped the insides out and put them in the refrigerator to chill for about 20 min.  Instead of a crouton in the center I just fried a slice of white bread in butter and used a piece of it for the center of the dumpling.  As far as I can tell this added nothing to the dumpling and unless it was added becuse the potato may otherwise be raw in the center...it was unneccessary.  I hd to use about 1/2 cup more flour than in the recipe must because the dough was sooooo sticky...it took more flour to get the dough off of my hands, formed and dumped into the gulasch.  I also used to eggs instead of one. I put my dumplings directly in the Goulasch I was making (essentially a beef stew) and cooked them for approx. 20 min.  They turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.",
