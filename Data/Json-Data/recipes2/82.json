For pouring over, we used golden mushroom soup and Miracle Whip (we just never use mayo) along with the eggs, cheese and onion. In 9x13 pan we layered as follows: veggies, then stuffing, then the soup/egg mixture, then remaining cheese, and baked. We liked it alot, and decided that next time we will add ground sausage to it.
