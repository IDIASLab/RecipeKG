First I used 1/4 c vegetable oil regular granulated sugar and instead of vanilla sugar I used 1 tsp vanilla extract. I also added 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/4 c. applesauce and a few tablespoons of milk (but I didn't measure it exactly). I was happy with the result: it was a dense cake and not dry. I did not alter the baking time. I should mention also that I had a hard time getting a desired 'marble' effect. Perhaps it would be better to swirl the two batters together and then pour into the pan.",

I mixed tbsp. cocoa powder with 1/4 cup of the batter then added little bit by little bit more batter till I got a thick viscous pouring consistency. Then I poured the main batter into the tube mould then swirled the cocoa mixture by the spoonfuls all around. Came out of the oven with a nice swirl design:)",
