Otherwise the mixture gets a little soupy as it sits. Also use the plain unsweetened and unflavored rice vinegar. The combination of the rice vinegar with the lime juice creates a cleaner crisper taste. And for fun taste and to make it even prettier don't be afraid to add a little of the lime zest. I also have found that the \"Niblets\" type of canned corn seems to work best in this recipe. Either that or very lightly blanched fresh corn.",
