After I made the recipe as written the beer flavor was a little strong (especially since I was making it for a bunch of non-beer drinkers) and the tomato flavor a little weak so I added a second small can of tomato paste to balance things out. I then added some TVP (textured vegetable protien) granules for added texture and energy since we were taking this chili with us on a hiking trip. As the TVP rehydrated it left the chili a little too thick so I thinned it out with some tomato soup I had in the pantry (which was at this point starting to run out of tomato-flavored canned goods). A little more simmering and a dash of salt and it was really really good. I kept taking one more \"taste.\":) This is a great basic recipe and you can play with the balance of ingredients to get just the flavor you want.",

My friends don't like spicy, so I only used 3 TBS of chili powder and no hot sauce. But I'll be sure to spice up the leftovers... it is so delicious mild or hot! Serve it with shredded cheddar and sour cream, just delish! Oh, and I skipped the garbanzos...ick. Instead, I used small white beans and extra kidneys. You can suit it to your taste. Don't skip the beer OR the mustard or cumin...you'll be sorry!  Enjoy!",

I will definitely experiment with this further. I think I will try cutting the chili powder down by a Tbsp and be sure to use a darker beer - a stout or porter - next time. (I just grabbed some Miller High Life this time while at the grocery store.) I think that I'd also like to start off by adding and sauteing a med onion. On the plus side again it goes a LONG way. A small bowl (or mug) with a touch of cheese maybe a piece or bread and a side salad is a great meal. I really had not thought much of veggie chili before. Try it and see what you think.",
