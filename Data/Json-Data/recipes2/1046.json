They were good and the girls loved them but they were more work than they were worth IMO. The cheese was too big for the bread so that had to be trimmed then when you tried to roll it the bread would tear or the cream cheese would come out of the end I did not use a thick layer of cream cheese as the submitter suggested in the instructions). Also once you put the toothpicks in you couldn't put them seam side down b/c of the toothpick sticking through there to hold the seam closed. This was a great idea but it was just too much of a hassle for me...It would've been easier to just make a grilled cheese (still using the cream cheese mixture ans cheese b/c it was tasty) and cut it into sticks or whatever. Again this is just my opinion and someone else may have better luck w/ them. I'm glad I tried these just wish they would've worked the way I was thinking that they would. Thanks for sharing.:)",

It didn't stay in a roll shape while I was cooking it and it was difficult to flip over while I was baking it because the cheese melted everywhere.

I used whipped cream cheese(on hand) and then added slices of tomato when I put them together. I also made them on my griddle instead of the oven as a whole sandwich. They turned out well. It's a great basic and quick recipe.",

The 2\u2019nd time I made it as a sandwich with 2 pieces of bread, but sliced it into thirds before baking, pieces touching. It was easy to flip all 3 pieces at the same time. The flavor combination was delicious and my hubby wanted 2 more helpings after the first one! For those who enjoy lots of cheese filling then it\u2019s perfect. I\u2019ll be pleased with 1/2 the cheese.",
