I think one of the problems some might be having is that the directions aren't very specific--it says to prepare the pudding according to the box. On the box there are directions for making regular pudding and then directions for making pudding for pie. When making a pie use 1/4 c less milk. Make sure your strawberries drain on a paper towel before putting them on top of the pudding. If you do both these things it should turn out fine. I made this with lemon pudding instead of vanilla and that was really good.",
