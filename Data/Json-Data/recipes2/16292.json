I poured the sauce on the chops after browning covered the skillet and reduced the heat to simmer. I turned the chops every 15 minutes or so and let them cook for about an hour. Cooking them this way allowed the flavors to permeate the meat and the chops were so tender we did not need a knife to cut them. This recipe will be one I use often.",

I doubled this recipe and made everything as specified except that I rubbed salt on the pork chops along with the cayenne. The sauce was very tasty but the pork chops themselves were bland. Even though the sauce is poured on the chops and the sauce is flavorful it's not the same as having flavors infused in the meat. I think the chops need to be marinated in salt cayenne and probably something else. This dish also did not come out as tender and juicy as I like and I think it's because the pork did not cook in a sauce. So I'll make it again but I will make some changes next time. Still a good recipe though. Thanks!",
