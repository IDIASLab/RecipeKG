These flat cookies taste great but didn\u2019t stay a ball at all for us. We tried refrigerating them before baking and it seemed to make them worse instead of better. If someone wants to keep trying at this recipe, maybe freeze them before baking to see if it allows them to keep their shape. The flavor is spot on. I followed this recipe as directed but added 20 minutes to refrigerate them since mixing causes the coconut oil to soften up. Maybe use a rubber baking mold so it will stay round? I hope someone can come up with a fix because as the other reviewers have said, these are tasty. Definitely put powdered sugar on top when they come out of the oven.",
