I totally left out the pie crust on bottom. Also I'm not crazy about peanuts so for the topping I finely chopped peanut butter and chocolate chips and sprinkled that on top - fantabulous! A very rich and delicious dessert!",

The brownie mixture on the bottom is what made the texture and taste so incredible. Two tips: I had to cook the brownie layer longer than what the recipe recommended. In following the recommended time the brownie was obviously not done it was jiggly. I'm not sure why. 2. I used a graham cracker crust which made it sinfully great. This pie is a must try if you like chocolate brownies and peanut butter - thanks!",
