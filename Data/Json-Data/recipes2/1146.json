I really liked it though I made it with some minor variations - like no feta cheese about twice the (adult) spinach and Danon's strawberry yogurt instead of whatever the recipe called for. It was very tasty and my wife liked it enough she suggested it would be good as a main course when you just want a light dinner. It will become a staple here for things like picnic lunches and dinner sides.",
