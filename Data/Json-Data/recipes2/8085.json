This was decent. I agree with LilSnoo that it does need more orange flavor as I did not taste it. Maybe try adding in some fresh orange juice or zest? I also opted to serve this over rice. Some more sauce to spoon over the rice would've been nice too. This was a nice light meal and I do think that someone that likes tofu (more than me) would really enjoy it. Thanks for sharing.:)",
