I used individually wrapped swiss slices since I did not have Gruyere on hand. Also since I only had one pastry sheet I halved the other ingredients but still used one whole egg. The result was marvelous. My husband ate more of these than the soup I served them with for dinner. Thanks for the recipe. We'll definitely make it again!",
