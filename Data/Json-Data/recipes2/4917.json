I did not like the canned pears in this - I don't now what if anything I would change for the future. Maybe fresh pears I poach myself I don't know. Maybe just eliminate the pears entirely it's really good with the shortbread crust raspberry jam and baked almond (frangipane) filling alone. Thanks for sharing!",
