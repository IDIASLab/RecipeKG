After reading the reviews I changed a couple of things. I cut the garlic salt out completely and instead used a garlic infused olive oil. To the oil I added minced garlic red pepper flakes and italian seasoning and let that sit for about four hours to meld. Brushed fresh sourdough bread with the oil topped with diced tomatoes and sprinkled with shredded mozzarella and parmesan. We're going to try this on the grill tomorrow night with more tomatoes and more mozzarella. YUMMY!!",
