What I did is threw everything in my blender ran it through to a even consistancy and dumped it in a flat freezable container let it firm up then blended it again. When it firmed up the second time it was ready to go. I used my own homemade sugar free maple syrup and one teaspoon of my homemade pumpkin pie spice. This is MONEY. My kids and I LOVED it. Thank you so much for sharing this low-calorie treat! NOTEL You can get away with using half the amount of syrup and still have it be sweet enough. If you aren't a fan of maple syrup you could substitute honey of agave nectar and have it taste really good too.",

I'm not sure what the submitter used but on hand I had Fage and Spring Tree maple syrup. I ended up having to smooth out the Fage taste with half and half (to taste) and extra maple syrup. I love my Fage and I eat it for breakfast with strawberries and hardly any added sugar; for some reason the combination of packed pumpkin spices and Fage just left a strange aftertaste. I blended everything to the same consistency in my blender before pouring it into my ice cream maker. It only took 10-15 minutes to set up.",

I actually used non-fat Greek-style yogurt; the texture is a little icier than intended but it still tastes great and is nearly entirely guilt free! I also don't have an ice cream freezer so I took the advice from another reviewer (who used a blender) and mixed it three times over the course of a few hours keeping it in the freezer in between. It worked beautifully! I can't wait to make it again and experiment with the spice/sweetness ratio. I'll be bringing this to holiday celebrations in the very near future for sure!",
