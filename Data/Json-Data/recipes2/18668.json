It is good recipe because it's simple and doesn't require tons of ingredients for the times you just can't be bothered to do elaborate cooking. I didn't have mushroom soup or mushrooms on hand so I guessed on making a gravy for the beef. For the gravy flavour About midway through browning the meat I added 2 chopped onions and let it continue to cook stirring every so often. Then after a short time I then added more flavourings... sprinkled about 3 tsp beef bouillon powder 1 tsp garlic powder 1/2 tsp black pepper 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1 tsp salt and stirred it around to make sure it mixed througly. To make the gravy I added a sprinkling of 2 tbsp of flour mixed it around so that the flour coated much of the meat and then added about 3/4 cup of milk and about 1 tbps soya sauce. I didn't need to add chopped onions but I like the texture and flavour of cooked onions with meat. You could use onion powder instead. For the mashed potatoes I use some milk butter and salt. I topped the potatoes with shredded cheddar since that's what I had.",
