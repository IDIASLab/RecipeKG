Hubby is on a smoothie kick as he wants to find a replacement for coffee on his commute in the morning. He asked for a raspberry/blackberry combo and I was happy to find this one. It is extremely easy with ingredients I had on hand. My fridge makes smaller ice cubes so I added a little more and it was perfect. Will make this often this summer. Thanks for sharing!",

I'm not fond of smoothies with bits of fruit left and some liquid is what helps them blend up really smooth. It also just got stuck in the blender a lot. So there was a bit of a hassle factor involved. Also as someone else pointed out -- the seeds. Blackberries and raspberries both end up with a lot of seed to contend with and while the suggestion to strain it is a really good one (which I will try on other smoothies) I just don't see how to strain something thick like this through something that would catch seeds. Therefore even though I liked the taste I don't think I'd want to make this again.",

Freeze 1st until they are ice cubes and only use 1/2 banana. I use organic cane sugar instead of honey if needed because I'm not a honey fan. If it is too thick I add some V8 fusion Goji raspberry or Acai raspberry juice. That juice also adds some veggies to it as well. The puree and some fresh crushed berries also works when making a yogurt parfait with whole grain granola cereal and walnuts. 1 layer of yogurt your choice 1 layer crushed fruit and the a little puree. Again your choice of fruit 1 layer cereal and walnuts. Repeat until the glass of your choice is full.",
