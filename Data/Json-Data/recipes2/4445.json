The sharp cheddar and some salt/pepper to taste gives it some needed flavor, and it sets up nicely. I did take it down to 325 and let it bake for another 10 minutes, and the crust did not burn. If you want to spruce it up, you certainly can. This recipe screams for needing some sauteed onions and garlic. However, I didn't have the time to do that this time. If I were going to make this for guests, I would take the time to add some other ingredients/spices or find a more complicated recipe. Thanks Lilacs, I had a good breakfast this morning, and my toddler ate it up too. *Update-I have made this 4 times now. I use 5 eggs and a nice scoop of Miracle Whip. I add some onion powder, garlic powder and turmeric. It's so easy, and DD loves it. I freeze portions, and they reheat well in the microwave.",
