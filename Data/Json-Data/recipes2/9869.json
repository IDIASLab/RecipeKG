While slightly jiggly in center refrigerated for 4 hours to stiffen. The cheesecake came out extremely smooth and didn t crack as typical with some cream cheese cakes. Tasted well and like a cannoli so plated with a raspberry coulis on the side. A great holiday cheesecake with a great smooth texture.",
