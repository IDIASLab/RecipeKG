I dressed the salad with a sugar free raspberry vinaigrette and my husband and I devoured the entire bowl. Thanks so much for the post!",

We don't like our salads dry so mixed up a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar with a few teaspoons of brown sugar dash of salt and pepper to taste. Wonderful tangy sweet salad. Edit - we tried spinach and mixed greens and liked it even better! I would highly recommend using those instead of red leaf lettuce.",
