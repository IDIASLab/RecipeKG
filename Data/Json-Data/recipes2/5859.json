I halved the recipe for 2 adults and 1 child (very little leftovers) and used a 15 oz. can of crushed tomatoes rather than pureed. Made it a day ahead so I let it sit on the counter at room temp a little over an hr. b4 topping w/ cheese and putting it in the oven for closer to 25-30 min. as I wanted to ensure even heating but not mushy pasta.
