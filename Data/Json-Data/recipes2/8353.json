I served it with a bit of mashed cauliflower (we're  trying to watch the carbs) and my wife loved it.",

I used 1 lb breasts, two to a pan (2 pans) but they  weren't cooked through in the times shown so I moved them to a baking dish (without the reduced sauce) and baked for 15 minutes at 350. I poured out all of the pan juices and put most of the reduced sauce on them, leaving some of the sauce so people could add extra if they wanted. The chicken was tender and delicious. FYI: I purchased the berbere spice  at the grocery store (Kroger) rather than making it as the video shows.",
