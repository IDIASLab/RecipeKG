My comment shall be more directed at Mr. \"Poppycock's\" comment. You, sir,  are rude & narrow minded. The recipe states that it is TURKEY chili, or didn't you catch that part?  If you prefer beef chili, then move on but don't be rude. Chili is something that is made in a wide variety of ways according to ingredients & region & some people enjoy trying new twists on things. And, addressing your anti-grain, pro-fat rant... How's that diet working for your colon health??? A good , healthy diet should be whole food ingredients and mostly plants. There's nothing wrong with meat or dairy but neither should be the largest portion on the plate & should be eaten in moderation. Grains are not \"poison\", not if they are whole grains AND, once again, eaten in moderation. The real culprit to diabetes and obesity is processed food & too much sugar. Perhaps you have a secret jealous streak because you, as a firehouse cook didn't promote your cooking style & someone else did? Grow up!!",

Course if I had a firehouse station full of fireman to make this for I would gladly double or triple the recipe but that's beside the point. A very good chili very thick nice flavor perfect spice that didn't necessarily require a heavy squirt of hot sauce and I liked the addition of BBQ sauce which I'm sure depending on the brand you use could be a hit or a miss.
