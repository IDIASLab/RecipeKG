When the water started boiling I added the (gluten-free) pasta, turned off the fire, put on a cover then waited 30 minutes. When I took the cover off all I needed to do was stir it up and serve it!!!! Perfection! \nThe second time we added a can of green beans and our own ground beef substitute when we removed the lid and sprinkled a bit more  'Yellow Stuff' on top of each serving.  This pushed it up to 10 stars!!!!",
