I do make a few changes for my family- First, I take out the beef because I don't really care for it. Second, I use one 8 ounce package of Philadelphia cream cheese instead of ricotta cheese since no one in my family will eat ricotta.  It probably adds lots of calories, but the cream cheese makes the casserole soooo good! As one reviewer said, it's kind of bland so to add more flavor, I took their advice and also mix in about a teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon of oregano. Also, I change the shredded mozzarella to Sargento Mozzarella and Provolone mix and sprinkle garlic salt on top of the cheese. I always line the pan with aluminum foil to make cleanup a breeze. Hope this helps!",

One of the easiest recipes I've ever tried, so easy that my 15-year-old son made it all by himself, with only verbal cues from me!  Upon advice of a couple reviewers, we switched out the ricotta for cream cheese to reduce the water content and added in dried oregano, garlic salt and Italian spices to season the meat. Whole family loved it.  Thank goodness we increased the servings to provide dinner for two nights.  Will definitely make this again...SOON!",

I am not a fan of ragu sauces anyway. I hadn\u2019t bought any in a while and was gonna give it another shot. Nope! To sum it up, this recipe is delicious if you use the right sauce!
