I also added chopped ham bits, the rest of the seasoning and threw it in the oven.  I think it turned out awesome!!  It turns out the season salt is KEY to the great taste, it takes the edge off the sour cream flavor.  I also just used random cheese that needed to be used in addition that it called for.",
