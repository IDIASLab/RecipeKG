                "reviewBody": "I'd like to address a few concerns from the reviews: This was a recipe passed to me from my mother-in-law and is one of those that doesn't list measured amounts, being made \"from memory.\" The dumplings vary from batch to batch.I have remade them several times with measurements and have found that two large potatoes equal approximately 2 cups of 1\" cubed peeled potatoes and you will need around 2 cups of white flour. You may want to put in 1/2 cup at a time. Depending on the moisture content of the potatoes and/or the size of the eggs, you made need more than 2 cups. The last time I made, 2 cups was enough. The most recent batch I needed 2 1/2 cups. I always make a few dumplings first in the pan of boiling water. If they start to fall apart within a few minutes of cooking, you need to add more flour. It is not unusual to see some small pieces break from the edges. Take a dumpling out to taste--should be a little chewy in the middle and softer on the outside. To address the \"blandness\" that has been described, I realized there was no salt in the dough. I have started putting about 1/2 teaspoon of salt in the dough. Also, you will get a lot of salt from the bacon. If you aren't cooking with bacon and onions, plan on gravy or sauerkraut on top, or just add some butter to melt on. I hope this helps anyone willing to try my recipe.",

I didn't think they were that hard to make especially with a food processor. Once the potato and egg were mixed together it was really soupy. I was afraid I would need another potato but I just kept adding flour until it was like bread dough and they came out great. I used four good sized pieces of bacon and buzzed those in the food processor to cut them into small pieces. It made the food processor very greasy but it was a lot faster than cutting with scissors and the pieces were nice and small. It's definitely not low fat or low cal but they taste great and are easy to make. I think you could come up with a good soup based off of these dumplings. Maybe a corn chowder with bacon dumplings yum... I'll have to experiment.",

I can see why one reviewer said she added too much flour - it would be helpful if the ingredients listed an approx amount of flour to use. I started with a 1/4 cup and kept adding 1/4 cups until I had put 1 1/4 cups of flour in. I also had far too much onion - I used a Vidalia and it ssems that 1/2 a large Vidalia is a lot more than 1/2 of a yellow onion.

They grow very much in size then so if you add baking powder make them very small. I found this recipe while trying to find a pierogi recipe. It was very good. I didn't chop the bacon but fried it in the skillet and crumbled it when done no messy clean-up of the food processor. Since these are a relative of pierogis you would probably do well by just sauteeing the onions and dumplings in butter. Boil the dumplings in a large kettle not a pot. They need room to swim around in the boiling water.",

I squeeze out all of the extra liquid from the onion and potatoes before adding the egg or flour. You want them as tender as they can be so use the least amount of flour you can. It is okay if bits fall off of them while cooking! I scoop teaspoon-sized amounts off of the side of a plate into boiling water. If you get the spoon very hot in the boiling water first the dough won't stick as badly. When they rise to the top time them 5 minutes and take out and drain. Besides frying them with the bacon and onion Mom served them with cottage cheese on top! Yum!!",

I just didn't care too much for the bacon onion part because I a lot of the fat stayed on the bacon and the bacon did not get the crispy texture I prefer. It was easily fixed however by cooking the bacon in strips first; then removing from fat to cool; then frying onion in fat; after add the dumplings and crumble the bacon on top. This was delicious!

Back in the days when moms and grand-moms cooked they almost never measured. They judged by consistency. Having a recipe passed down to you is sometimes difficult to duplicate because its being passed from someone whose done it for years and doesn't measure at all. That being said I followed PAMINMI's advice and I loved these. I added about 1tsp of salt and 1tsp garlic powder to the dough and a bit of heavy cream into the onions and bacon for a kind of creamy sauce. I served them with pork chops baked in the oven and my husband went back for seconds. Thanks for the second post Paminmi it definitely helped =)",
