After reading the reviews I took the advice of changing the amounts and used whole 16 oz bag of noodles, 12 oz sour cream and 8 oz cream cheese which I mixed in with the noodles first before layering, then used 1 1/2 lbs of meat.  I also used 26 oz of sauce which I think really made the difference in it not being too dry.  I like lots of garlic too and only used 1/2 white onion that I cooked first!  Fit perfectly in 9x13 pan and the cheese didn't overflow!  Delish and my 5 yr old loved it!",

You'd need to use a 16 oz bag of egg noodles and double everything else except the onions. No way this fits into a 9x13 pan. I just stared at it in disbelief when I started assembling it.\n\nAlso, it would be easier to mix the noodles with the sour cream/cream cheese mixture before assembling it. I found several of the noodles once baked were dry with no sauce on them. The taste is ok, it seems to be missing something though. May want to experiment with spices you know you like. I didn't add anything to it, made the recipe just like it appears and I was pretty disappointed. I *may* make it again, but will make some big changes.",

I didn't have any onions, so I used onion powder.  I used 2 cloves of garlic from a jar already minced.  I left the cream cheese and sour cream sit for a while and then I creamed them together in a mixer.  Then I mixed it together with the pasta.  then I layer the pasta mixture and meat mixture in a 8x8 pan.  And since I love cheese, I used way more then 1 cup of cheddar cheese.",
