No need to change a single thing but suggest always marinading in XL clip-lock plastic bags rather than a covered dish giving the bag a squish to spread the marinade and turn every 6-8 hours and always marinade it for 36 hours.. And to those who leave the bbq lid open no need but you must always check and turn as a little bit of char is necessary to make this dish oh so special... ENJOY!",
