Also FYI 4 cups of oil will only deep fry in a deep cooker that will allow only 4 wings at a time to cook and thus drives up the cooking time. Just plan accordingly or get more oil with a bigger pot. I found one stick unsalted butter with table spoon of garlic and 4 tbls of ground parmesan cheese to be a good dipping sauce. Also for traditional buffalo sauce one stick of butter with a cup of Frank's Red Hot Buffalo sauce a good combination.",
