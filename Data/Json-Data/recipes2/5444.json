Regular sugar would probably work better than trying to roll them in powdered sugar.  I did not have any trouble with the chocolate leaking out . My problem was the tortilla inflating and starting to unroll while in the oil. I had to hold them down with a spatula which was a bit hard to do since I had 3 frying at once. Next time I will secure them with a toothpick.",
