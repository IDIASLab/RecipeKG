I doubled the sauce for a pound of angel hair and used two chicken breasts and i think that ratio was perfect. the sauce was pretty thin but i actually enjoyed it that way which is strange for me as i usually like a creamier sauce but this was great! i used a brick of colby jack cheese and it was the tiniest bit stringy but that was probably my fault for shredding the cheese too thick. i also eliminated the jalapeno and doubled the garlic. the flavor was intense the sauce was delicious and somehow managed to coat the pasta very well even though it was thin. everyone in my family enjoyed this and i will definitely be making it again. yum!!!",

Everyone in the house ate it but I would definitely make some small changes next time I prepare it. I used 1 bell pepper and 1 onion & felt that it was too much for the amount of sauce that the recipe yields. So next time I will either cut the amount of those two vegetables in half or double the liquid ingredients in the sauce. There was so much onion it was hard to decipher what was onion and what was pasta. Maybe the ones I used were just too large. I did take the other reveiwer's advice and make sure all the veggies were chopped and ready to go prior to cooking the pasta and chicken. Overall it was good just going to doctor it up next time to suit our family's tastes. Thank you for providing a nice change of pace for dinner tonight!",

I also skipped the bell pepper adding a bit more onion instead. Also instead of pasta I put the gravy and chicken over mashed potatoes which turned out very delicious. The only thing I was a bit disappointed in was the fact that even after breading my chicken and adding extra spice on top for some reason it didn't seep into the meat itself. Major bummer:(.

Once the sauce was finished (had to use a little corn starch to thicken) I put my cooked linguini in the pan with the sauce and coated it. I only cook for two so there was a little left over but my bf took that for lunch the next day and said it was even better. Good man:) When I make it again (and again and again and...)
