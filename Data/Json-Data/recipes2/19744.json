I started again and only used 1/2 c of milk (I figured I could add more if it needed it). I used 16 oz of claw meat which was 1/3 the price of backfin meat and I didn't have to pick shells out. It also added a pretty pinkish-orangish color that was perfect for my fall theme. I used quite a bit more of the Old Bay. I baked it in an oven dish and skipped the bread bowl and cheese. It looked beautiful when it was done. My guests devoured it and everyone asked for the recipe. Thanks Kristy!",

Made it all the day before (without the cheese) and returned to oven with the cheese for about 1/2 hour right before serving. Served with garlic/parmesan crackers.
