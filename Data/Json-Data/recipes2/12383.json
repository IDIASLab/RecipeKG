I quickly created the recipe for these paleo orange muffins that's so easy and quick to make that, by the time you are ready to start your day, your paleo breakfast will be ready for you! Warm and delicious like you just walked into an artisan bakery!&hellip; Or at least that's what I often feel for breakfast after being born and raised in Italy, where breakfast happens with pastries and croissants! You know me, I love baking. Top them with acai powder and a dollop of fig jam.",
