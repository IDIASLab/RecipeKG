Other reviewers stated they were crumbly and fragile so I only baked them for 8 minutes and then let them sit on the pan for additional 10 minutes. This definitely helped them stay softer and they weren't crumbly. However I just did not care for the very strong artificial taste of the liquid vanilla flavor stevia. It was overpowering to me. I think using real vanilla extract would give them a better flavor and they will still be sweet enough.",

I appreciate the attempt but these are a hard pass for us (as in one bite and the other 11 cookies are probably trash bound. OK faculty room at work bound as not to waste.).",

That amount made 9 cookies for half the recipe. I could try adjusting the recipe for more peanut butter taste and cookie texture by adding more peanut butter peanut powder or butter for richness.
