After a 'test run' I did find the mustard a bit too pronounced, so I added a little more creme fraiche.  The puff pastry I had in my supermarket (Pepperidge Farms) was about 10\" by 10\", so when I rolled up (twisted) a half inch on all sides, I was left with a 9\" by 9\" area.  For this, I needed about 12-13 medium sized stalks of Asparagus, but only used one portion of the sauce. This square was perfect for 4 portions as a side dish.",

I mean, look at the ingredients -- you'd have to mess up worse than I did to make it not delicious. \n\nFirst, apparently, there are different sizes of puff pastry.  This is my first time using it, so I didn't realize it and I got a giant one.  It didn't really detract from the deliciousness, it just made a ton more than Chef John's.  Second, I didn't have a silicone baking mat.  I didn't think it would make a big difference, but the bottom burned really bad in the first 10 minutes of \"pre baking\".  The burned part luckily stuck to the pan, so I just ran with it, and the second part of the baking when I transferred it to a different pan it crisped it up nicely.  All in all, very delicious.",
