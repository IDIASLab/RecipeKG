With the following adjustments we agreed that it would be a 5... added a little pineapple juice to the dressing too thick to \"drizzle\" otherwise. Sprinkled some cajun snack mix over the top to add some crunch as it is a very wet salad. My dad also thought adding some sunflower seeds might be a good addition although we did not try it. Definitely recommend this it was a hit!",
