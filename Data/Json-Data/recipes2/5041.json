The flour to fat ratio is way off compared to any recipe or dish I've ever made.. But decided to roll with it with the minor adjustments. The end result was creamy and I was pleased with the consistency. This dish could really benefit with the addition of salt possibly herbs some hot sauce or jalepenos and garlic. I will definitely make a variation of this again trying a different cheese.. Maybe the tex mex blend. Also will try roasting the cauliflower instead of boiling to add more flavor and keep more of the nutrition.",

Not being a fan of salt it was nothing that a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper wouldn't fix. Corey liked the fact that the flavour of cauliflower was prominent. I was worried about the sauce not being thick enough so I used whole milk in the amount called for and cooked for about 5 1/2 minutes until it was as thick as I wanted it. The overall result was a creamy sauce and nicely browned topping. Personally I would add additional seasoning or another handful of cheese to the sauce and I would definitely make it again.",

Otherwise I ended up with a clumpy mess that I ended up tossing then starting over. Also I made a similar recipe where you add the sauce over the cooked cauliflower. That made it easier to mix the two together. Lastly I would maybe skip the margarine in the bread crumbs. This made it clumpy and more difficult to spread evenly.",
