This time I added real mushrooms because it's hard for me to call something \"mushroom meatloaf\" if the only mushrooms are in canned soup. So I added chopped cremini mushrooms to the meat mixture and sliced ones to the sauce. I omitted the onion soup mix because I thought it would be too salty (and I don't like the ingredients in those mixes) but as a result it wasn't quite salty enough.:-) So next time I'll add some Italian seasoning garlic powder salt and pepper. But as I said even without those I liked it and the BF thought it was really really good.",
