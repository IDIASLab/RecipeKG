I took other reviewer's advice and added broccoli and onions and used Ritz instead of saltines.  I didn't use the full amount of butter to cook the veggies in and I didn't think it needed butter on the top.  Delicious!  doesn't make a ton - might use two boxes of rice next time.

I followed the recipe pretty exactly. I would not add any salt to this because the wild rice mix and the Classico sauce both have enough for those who tend to be salt-sensitive. You can always add more later! In other recipes I've made using cracker crusts like this I've always mixed the butter and crackers together and I did that too but it does take a little more butter. This would be pretty good sized servings for 4. Thank you so much Sandra! This was really nice!",
