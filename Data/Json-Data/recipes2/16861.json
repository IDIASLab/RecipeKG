I don't know why this simple combination of cheese and mayo makes this so extraordinary and delicious but it does. I didn't bother to soak the fish in milk first which shouldn't be necessary if it's really fresh. I just seasoned it with pepato an Italian fish seasoning of sea salt pepper lemon and orange zest then sprinkled the cheese mixture with paprika to give it color. Unless your filets are really thick I'd start off with less baking time--you can always give it a few minutes more but fish can get overdone quickly.",
