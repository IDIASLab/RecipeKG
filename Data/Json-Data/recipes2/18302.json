I did not use the exact amounts listed in this recipe but \"eyeballed it\" and adjusted where I though appropriate. I definitely did not use that much olive oil. Probably only 2 Tbsp. I also used only one can of albacore tuna and I think the kind I used was key. I bought the BumbleBee Prime Fillet albacore tuna for the first time and it was so much better than regular albacore tuna! Not fishy or oily at all. I was pleasantly surprised. I used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. I also used a little less oregano and seasoned with salt and pepper. I am surprised she left salt and pepper out of the recipe. I also did not add the Parmesan cheese. Next time I may experiment by adding peas or capers. Portion-wise it only made two servings because I like a lot of sauce with my pasta. Overall this was a very quick and healthy weekday meal. I will make it again!",

I used penne and subbed red wine because that's all I had. I added a good pinch of red pepper flakes as it tasted kind of bland and also the sauce was very thin. Next time I think I'll add a tbsp or so of tomato paste to thicken it up and give the sauce more body and maybe some capers or olives (which I think would go great with the tuna) and basil. This would also be a great dish to add some beans to if you were looking for something very filling! Pretty good as is but lots of potential in this one!",
