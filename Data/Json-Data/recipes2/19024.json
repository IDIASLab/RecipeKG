A whole bag of \"tiny twists\" was perfect for this recipe. This was great though I'd like to add some dill next time. That's a personal addition no reflection on the original recipe. We all enjoyed these at family movie time.....even the husband! NOTE: Definitely don't skip the baking step. You might have an issue with soggy pretzels later if you do. Whatever you don't eat will keep well in air-tight Tupperware or freezer bags.",
