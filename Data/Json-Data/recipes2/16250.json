I asked my family what they would rate it and my brother the chef looks at me and goes \"This is good. The chicken is actually tender. You always overcook chicken.\" Thanks Davey. Anyway everyone liked it but we all thought the sauce needed more balance it was just too sweet. When I make this again I think I'll add some chicken stock to the orange juice. Also some salt is needed.",

I followed the recipe to a T including the cooking time using the juice of the oranges I zested with a little Tropicana added since I didn't quite have enough. I thought the cooking time was a little long and as another reviewer mentioned it was difficult to keep the chicken from burning. My main criticism of the recipe is the amount of zest... do you really need a tablespoon? It gave the dish too much bitterness. If I make it again I will cut it down to a teaspoon. Also I would probably use brined chicken or marinate the chicken beforehand in Mojo or some orange-based solution as I feel it could have really used that orangey flavor throughout the whole breast. Thanks for an interesting recipe!",
