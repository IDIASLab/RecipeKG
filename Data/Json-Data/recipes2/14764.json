However the directions were not very clear so I only gave it three stars. I sprinkled the thyme over the chicken with a little pepper before I started. I then browned the chicken in the butter. I deglazed the pan with low sodium chicken broth and simmered for 30 minutes. The 30 minutes was really too long and my chicken was a little over done. I removed the chicken and boiled the sauce down. This took about five minutes and made a lot of sauce. Don't take the easy way out with a thickener like corn starch though when boiled down the sauce gives you a slightly salty mixture with a strong thyme flavor. Because the mix is already a little salty I really recommend lost sodium broth. My 13 month old loved it and I will make again for sure. Next time I may try adding a little lemon juice to the mixture while simmering.",

I didn't take the time to cook the chicken thoroughly during the browning phase just browned quickly on each side then added the chicken broth and simmered about 20-30 minutes.
