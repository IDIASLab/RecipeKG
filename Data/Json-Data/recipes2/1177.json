Time did not permit that I cook so my fiance did it two days before, let it cook for a day or so on low, and wow, what a winner. Did not have the Gluwein though, but next time we will and I'm sure it will be the best. Great with olive bread toasted under the oven grill.",

When I used the immersion blender, it was w-a-a-a-y too thick.  I did add considerably more chicken broth to reach my desired consistency, and I think that diluted the squash flavor just a bit.  I did use a very large jalape\u00f1o, but its flavor was lost in the soup, so not sure I\u2019d even bother adding that again.  Although I\u2019ll admit that Curried Butternut Squash and Pear Soup on this site still is my favorite, this one\u2019s hitting a close second.  In the future, I think I\u2019ll emulsify the soup as soon as the squash is cooked trying to retain the full butternut squash flavor.  This one\u2019s a keeper, and I definitely would make again!",
