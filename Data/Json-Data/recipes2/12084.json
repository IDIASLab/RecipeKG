They were bland, gummy, way too dense--not fluffy or a pancake consistency at all.",

I added 3 whole eggs, 3/4 c flour, 3/4 c milk, 1/2 c sugar instead of honey.  I made it with cottage cheese one time, and with greek yogurt another and I preferred the yogurt substitution.  I really love that these felt like they were a substantial breakfast, not just a bread.",
