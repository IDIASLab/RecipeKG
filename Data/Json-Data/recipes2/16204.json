Also I cut the sugar sub to 1/2cup using part slenda and part brown sugar twin. The last batch I added 2teaspoons of real sugar too. I find this makes the texture and taste better without affecting a diabetic at all. Instead of 2 egg whites, I used 1 whole egg. This still makes each muffin less than 1 gram of fat.

That's easily remedied, though - I threw in 1/3 cup chopped, toasted pecans and stuck one on the top of each muffin. They rose up beautifully, and tasted very good, but stuck to the paper liners terribly. I think the Splenda is the cause of this - when using another muffin recipe from the Splenda web site, the directions included spraying the paper liners with cooking oil spray. The papers come off the muffins perfectly. I will try this trick the next time I use this recipe.",
