I thought that this was going to be dry and tasteless but it was moist and full of flavor. The combination of the grilled pineapple and the sweet chili mayo took this burger to another level for me. The only thing I did differently was I used fresh ground turkey as opposed to the premade frozen patties. The frozen burgers are convenient and a real time saver but I looked at the label and decided that fresh was going to be a better choice for me. I am saving this recipe so I can make these again very soon. Thanks for the recipe!",

Because of diet restrictions for family members I could not use the Butterball frozen burgers way to much sodium. I used Butterballs everyday fresh ground turkey in place of the frozen burgers. Seasoned the meat myself eliminating the salt. Much better for my family and very very tasty. Makes a great dinner and I think these burgers would impress your guest at your next BBQ.",
