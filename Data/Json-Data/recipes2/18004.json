First, diced the onions and sauteed the onions and garlic in extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil until browned and very tender, then added some beef boullion/base to give it a beef flavor and then added the mushrooms and tofu cubes, after they were cooked, used 12 ounces fat-free sour cream with the fresh dill as we didn't like how the cottage cheese didn't result in as creamy a sauce.  Because we used the beef/boullion/soup base, we left out the soy sauce.  We also used whole wheat wide noodles.",

I did make some minor adjustments to the recipe because I didn't have cottage cheese on hand. I used ricotta cheese and extra sour cream with about a 1/4 cup of milk. I did add a little more soy sauce than the recipe called for. Just an fyi- make sure to put butter on your egg noodles after you drain them so they don't stick. I forgot and had clumps of noodles.:) I would make this again and try it with the cottage cheese.",
