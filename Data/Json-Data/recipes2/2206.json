I halved the recipe since it's just my husband and me but I put in 2 eggs instead 1 1/2. This didn't affect the consistency at all; in fact, I added a 1 tablespoon more milk because the mixture seemed too thick. It turned out great. My husband loved it. We're planning to fix this for Thanksgiving  finally, a dessert low in sugar, nutritious, and low in over all carbohydrates. I'm so glad I found this recipe!",
