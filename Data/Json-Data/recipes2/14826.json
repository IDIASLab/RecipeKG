I've never seen sun-dried tomato and oregano salad dressing in the markets where I shop so I took a guess at some ingredients. For the marinade and dressing I blend 2 Tbsp. chopped sun dried tomatoes (from a jar) 3 Tbsp. olive oil 1/4 c. red wine vinegar 1 tsp. Worcestershire 1/2 tsp. oregano 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and few shakes each of salt pepper and white sugar in my small food processor. Wow-incredibly yummy!! I have no idea if this ended up anything like the intended dressing but it was the best dressing I've ever made from scratch. I make this salad at least every couple of weeks.",
