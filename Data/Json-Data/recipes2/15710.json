I only used half of the amount called for and still the intensity of the \"fake\" rum taste and smell was nauseating. We have made homemade eggnog before and the thought of a virtually fat free version was enticing. (Skim milk and fat free/sugar free pudding were used) I was about to throw this all away but decided to let it sit in the refrigerator overnight and try it again in the morning. The smell was still unappealling but the flavors blended and it didn't taste as bad as the night before. It still wasn't \"good\" but it is worth trying again with A LOT less rum flavoring (maybe 1/4 teaspoon!)",

AMAZING! No more small sips here and there of eggnog for me. And hey my sister is my toughest critic and a HUGE eggnog lover from way back. And she said it tasted no different!

I used 2 cups to mix with the pudding mix and then only had to add 1-3/4 cups more to get it to the desired thickness. I started out only using 1 tsp. rum extract but ended up adding more for a more 'authentic ' flavor and also used more nutmeg than called for (to taste). While this would never replace 'real ' eggnog this was a great substitute that I would make again! Thanks for sharing.:) UPDATE: After letting it set in the fridge it did get quite a bit thicker and I ended up having to add more milk to thin it out so I would say that I did end up using close to the amount called for.",

I tried this recipe on New Years Eve at a family party. 6 people tried this eggnog and they all LOVED it! It tastes just like the real thing! Thank you thank you!! I now have a safe solution and it's very cost effective too! I tried it two ways and both were equally delish: I made it with fat-free vanilla pudding mix and used skim milk and it was wonderful and still had some of the thickness you'd expect from an eggnog but not too thick. I also tried it with 2% milk and regular pudding mix and it was just as good. I will be using the fat-free method! Guilt-free eggnog! I also did not use the run extract. I added an ounce of white rum to my glass and that's what the others did as well. It was wonderful and if you didn't say anything nobody would EVER know the difference!",
