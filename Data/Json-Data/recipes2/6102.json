                "reviewBody": "I absolutely love Jamaican Jerk recipes and so the idea of having one made with tofu intrigued me.   This was a very good recipe with a bit of clarification.   One, the recipe uses the term jerk sauce and jerk marinade indiscriminately.   They are two different things.   A jerk sauce is used on the finished product for dipping and is usually not very spicy, where a jerk marinade is used in the preparation of the product (usually meat, but in this case tofu), and is usually quite spicy and has flavors of Scotch Bonnet peppers and Allspice.   I used Walkerswood Jerk Seasoning (the preferred island seasoning) and diluted it with Italian dressing for my marinade (1 part seasoning, 2 parts Italian dressing).   This was perfect for our tastes.   The second thing that should be added to this recipe is a quick microwave warm-up after it is assembled, but before the sour cream and salsa.   The beans are cold, the shell cold and the cheese cold, and the result is a cold dish.   Other than those two things, this recipe is wonderful and I'm sure that I will make it again.   Thank you for the new experience.",

My husband does not like the texture of tofu so I'll probably make with with chicken marinated in jerk sauce next time. Otherwise this recipe is creative and yummy!",
