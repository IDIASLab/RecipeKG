I will definitely keep this around for days such as today (cold and rainy) and perfect for when I don't have a lot of time energy or fresh groceries. I might serve this with jalapeno cornbread or hushpuppies. It is very good as given but would also be good to throw in whatever is on hand. Thanks! Just what I was looking for. Okay I had to come back and change this to 5 stars. It is even so much better the second night! The flavors have blended and it just bloomed -- became a serious contender! I also wanted to mention that at first I put only 1/2 teaspoon red pepper but I do like medium hot and there just wasn't any heat the first night even though I added several grinds of black pepper too. The second night I added another 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper and it was perfect for medium hot - so next time I will start with 1 teaspoon. Also tonight I wanted a little green veggie so chunked in a can of okra in tomatoes. It was sooooooo good! This went from being something I like and can use to a favorite one I'll make sure I keep some canned mackeral on hand for. Thanks for sharing this simple recipe. Oh I also added another egg tonight. Wonderful. Next time if I have only the condensed tomato soup I'll probably sub a can of seasoned diced tomato. Enjoy! I'm now adding fresh sliced carrot or...",
