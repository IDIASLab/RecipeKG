I loved all the flavors together.   I wanted my green beans cooked a little longer, so, I blanched my green beans in boiling water for a few minutes, immersed in an ice bath to stop the cooking and then drained and dried very well before adding to the hot pan to warm through.  If you like green beans very crispy I would follow the recipe as is. Very tasty!  Thanks for the recipe!",

Will shorten the saut\u00e9 time of the garlic as it was beginning to burn with the 4 minutes on the heat before the addition of the green beans. Maybe try saut\u00e9ing the garlic for a shorter period, add walnuts sooner, then scoop the walnuts out before adding the beans, adding the  walnuts at the end to keep them toasty-crisp. Will definitely make this again.",
