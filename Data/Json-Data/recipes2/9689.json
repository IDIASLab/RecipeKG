I used toothpicks to dip and coat my marshmallows. I left the toothpicks in and because it is close to Easter and I had them on hand I topped each toothpick with one of those cute bunny shaped marshmallows. The recipe makes a lot of sauce; I stopped at 60 marshmallows and had sauce left over. Bonus- this sauce once cooled is perfect for apple dipping! I think I'll try crushing the rice crispies next time my kids left a trail of crispies leading right to the tv.",
