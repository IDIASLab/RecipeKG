I bought salted cod because I had never seen it before and I like to try new things. I did not use onions but did add 1/2 teaspoon onion powder. I used 1 and 1/3 teaspoon old bay seasoning for the seafood seasoning which gave it a slight seasoned taste. Anything less and you would not be able to taste it (as others have said). I used 1 pound of yellow potatoes. Yukon gold would be the equivalent. I have no idea why people continuously post recipes with potato sizes instead of weight. You definitely have to use fresh parsley chopped course. It adds to the flavor in each bite and goes a long way for presentation. People who are complaining that it was too mushy are making crab cake sized cakes. If you look at the recipe it says make golf ball sized cakes. Your cakes will (and should be) small. They should be about 3/8\"-1/2\" thick. Make sure you have about 1/16\"-1/8\" of oil in the pan when you cook these. If your oil evaporates add more. You do not want to skimp on the oil or they won't brown and cook correctly.",
