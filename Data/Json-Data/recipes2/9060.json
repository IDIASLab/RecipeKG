I'm sure the green beans would taste good too. The seasonings were spot-on. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the more complicated steps of partially cooking the spaghetti squash and then putting the entire finished dish into the oven. The spaghetti squash was more difficult to cut in half plus I was unable to scrape as much squash out because it was undercooked. I will definitely make this dish again but next time I will cook the squash entirely in the oven then scrape it into the skillet at the end toss and serve. Then it will be unnecessary to put it all back in the oven. Thank you for the recipe!",
