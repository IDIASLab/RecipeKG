I have to admit that I was bit skeptical about this recipe at first, but since it seemed simple and I had all the ingredients on hand, I figured I'd give it a shot...and I'm glad I did.  First off, this recipe is so simple and easy that kids could make it themselves.  The sugar cookie \"crust\" with the peanut butter makes it taste like a peanut butter cookie with Reese's on top.  This would also be a nice easy dessert (thought a bit messy) for a pot luck, if you're looking to bring something different.",

I let the peanut butter and sugar cookie dough come to room temperature to make sure it would spread. It was easy and quick to put together & looked great. I also used mini peanut butter cups and cut each piece into square bite sized cookies just before serving. I suggest keeping this in the refrigerator until ready to serve as it quickly began to 'melt'. Will do again and maybe try different 'candy' toppings or drizzle chocolate on top.",

It just tasted like a load of peanut butter with a crunchy bottom. Didn't have peanut butter candies to chop and and put on top (thank goodnesss!) but did add the chocolate chips...which were not enough to add another dimension. So I warmed up some hot fudge sauce and drizzled it over the top. Looked prettier but only slightly improved the taste. Will not waste the extra ingredients to make this again!",
