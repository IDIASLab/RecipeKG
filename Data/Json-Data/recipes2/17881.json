I sauteed the chicken with 3 cloves of garlic and paprika first until just brown and drained the fat. Then I mixed the ingredients for the sauce increasing the dill to 5 tsp and tripling the onion soup mix and poured the mixture right into the pan! Brought it to a boil reduced heat and let simmer for 30 minutes. Why turn on the oven if you don't have to? The stove offers more control over doneness. So tender and flavourful. Thanks for the recipe!",

The only thing I changed was I cooked everything in a crockpot instead for 7 hours and instead of using cream of mushroom I used low fat cream of chicken. It made a lot of gravy and I served it over mashed potatoes. Excellent!!!",

I'd follow the directions to a T and you'll get a great easy chicken and some gravy for mashed potatoes too!",

I used chicken tenders which worked out great because there was no grease from the chicken and it cooked much faster. I also mixed all the ingredients in a bowl and then poured it over the chicken which I seasoned w/ salt and pepper. I added about 3x more dill and I am soooo glad I did that but next time I'll add even more! The sauce was really runny and I wanted it to be more gravy-like so I ended up having to add some cornstarch to get the right consistency I wanted. I also added broccoli and corn to get some veggies in. Overall this dish has a good flavor and it's fast and easy which is always a thumbs up for me.",
