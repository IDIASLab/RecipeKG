I have been making my own Ketchup and Mustard sauces for years. I use base 'tomato sauce' and then add splenda for sweet garlic seasonings cider vinegar onion salt etc. as my tastes warrant. Same thing with Mustard just add the flavors you like cayenne garlic black pepper. The options are endless. I love a sweeter mustard so I have been putting a little splenda in with garlic and man is it good on veggies or on the wraps I make with turkey and coleslaw.",
