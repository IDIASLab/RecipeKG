His didn't turn out too well since the cheddar cheese mixture was really globby and I couldn't get it to soak into the bread and had to sort of spread the cheese on. But the second time I didn't add the full one cup of cheese to the butter. maybe a wee bit over a half cup, and used Colby Jack instead of Cheddar. It melted much better than the cheddar did. Once it reached a well mixed taffy like texture I removed from the heat and put my thick slice of white bread on it and sort of soaked the mix in it like a sponge, then quickly removed it to the fry pan already heated on medium and ready, threw on the ham slices and then soaked up the rest of the cheese mixture with second piece of bread moving it and dabbing it until no mixture was left. Timing seems to be the key and the longer you wait the cheese mix starts to gob up. You may also want to start your egg while cooking the sandwich, or the sandwich gets pretty cool waiting for the egg. I liked the taste of the crusty cheese bread and the oozing egg yolk on top. Was a very nice breakfast treat. Just have everything out and ready and be prepared to have a bit of clean-up. But tasted very good and worth the extra work. My husband loved his even though it wasn't exactly pretty.",

Lol and 2) I saw some persons had issues with getting the shredded cheese to melt properly. It came out perfectly! I feel a little guilty about the cholesterol content of this meal but I'll get over it. Lol",

Took a while for the cheese to melt but it did eventually. Dipped the bread into the cheese (had to spread the cheese a little) and quickly put it on the already heated skillet.
