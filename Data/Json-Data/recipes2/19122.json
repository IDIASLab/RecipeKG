I used a can of diced tomatoes, a box of frozen chopped spinach, and a small onion.  I flavored it up with Italian Seasoning, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and chili flakes.  I used celantini pasta because it held the sauce very well.  For those who complained of grainy sour cream, don't add it until the very end before serving.  If the sour cream cooks, it gets grainy.  Pretty healthy, cheap, quick, and easy meal",
