Home to the original Bakewell tart before we moved here to America 2 years ago. The dessert dates back to the 1860s. Bakewell tarts are often called Bakewell puddings but the two desserts are essentially the same. While this recipe is pretty good I have had to make a few changes to make the recipe more traditional. The pastry should be an almond short crust pastry I make my pastry as usual but add 1/3 cup of ground almonds. For the frangipane centre I use Clementine zest not lemon. Once the tart has been baked I always top with Royal icing. A Bakewell tart can essentially be iced or not but for me the icing just finishes off the cake entirely.",
