I confess that I changed the recipe a bit because I didn't have time for a dry run with it as written and I was looking for a plain rich chocolate flavor.  My changes were simple - omitted lemon zest and wisked 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa into the dry ingredients and 1 tsp. vanilla extract in with the eggs.  The result was the flavor I'd hoped for with a light cake texture.  I'd prefer a slightly denser texture, but this can't be beat for for an easy, quick, from-a-mix recipe.  Using a 1-inch melon ball scoop yielded a small cookie - perfect for cookie exchanges.  Otherwise I would double the cookie size.  The trick to the crackles is to roll the dough balls around until the confectioners sugar is thick and even all the way around.  Be sure not to overbake or the cookies become too firm and dry.  Very pretty!",

(I agree with the commenter who urged people not to skip the lemon, it doesn't make these lemon flavored just adds a depth of taste to the cookie.) Also, as has been written here, I didn't think the cornstarch was necessary to making the powdered sugar coating. After the first batch, I mixed in some milk chocolate chips and some Andes Peppermint Crunch baking chips. Oh boy, are they wonderful!",

I read the other reviews and decided to use the lemon zest anyway. Don't skip this part! It gives the cookie a plate-cleansing bright flavor but just a touch. You don't even need to use a full teaspon. Also even though I doubled the recipe I only got 45 cookies! I used a 1 inch melon baller. I suspect I bought the wrong box mix: so WARNING- make sure it is Duncan Hines CAKE and not Red Velvet CUPCAKE box mix. I guess the box mix would have had a bigger amount. BUT that all being said the cookies turned out delicious and beautiful! Next time I will use the rigt box mix! Oh. And these cookies ARE messy but worth it!",
