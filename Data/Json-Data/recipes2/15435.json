I used half the amount of sugar called for but they still turned out way too sweet! Don't get me wrong I LOVE sweet desserts but this was just too much. My husband and friends agreed. I also found the cake dough to be fairly hard to work with (very crumbly and difficult to spread) and the cream cheese layer is too thick and sticky to pour evenly over the chips. Better to simply mix the chips in with the cream cheese and save yourself some trouble.",

I ended up having to press it in the pan. I also cut the sugar down to 1 cup and that was perfect and still sweet but not overly sweet. (3-1/2 cups seems like way too much). I threw the ingredients for the topping in the food processor and it poured nicely and evenly and the result was a nice cheese-like topping. Will be making again. Thanks",
