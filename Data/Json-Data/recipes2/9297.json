The base ingredients lend themselves easily to adjustments based on personal tastes. More or less ranch chicken or cheese. Even the chicken sauce can easily be heated up or toned down. 400 degree oven for 12 minutes on a parchment lined jelly roll pan worked perfect for me. Will have fun playing around with the ratios of ingredients but the recipe as is is A in our family's opinion.",

I loved the sweet yet spicy flavors you get from the honey/sriracha mixture. I made half a recipe as I was using the rest of the pizza dough for another pizza recipe. Because of this I used the 9\" pizza setting on my Panasonic countertop induction oven rather than the 12\" setting. It turned out perfect! I loved how the bottom crust had the grill marks from the grill pan and it was nice and crispy. I will be making this again in the near future but will be making the full recipe for sure. Yum!",

Seriously the flavors in this are wonderful- I was a little skeptical about the ranch base as that's not normally my thing but went ahead because of all of the glowing reviews and I'm glad that I did. That honey sriracha mixture? I could eat that with a spoon. Seriously amazing. I drizzled most of the extra over the top before baking and reserved a little extra for dipping. I made chicken nuggets for my son for dinner and even made an extra one for myself just so I could dip it in that amazing sauce! I followed the recipe exactly except I did add some sliced green onion. Definitely a keeper!",
