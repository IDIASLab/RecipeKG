Instead of Italian Dressing, I used Good Seasons Italian Fat Free Salad Dressing Mix \u2013 1.05oz, added 1/2 teaspoon of dried Parsley and 1/2 teaspoon of Garlic.  I heated two tablespoons of Olive oil and sprinkled all of the seasonings on the chicken coating each side well.  Once the chicken started to brown, I added the remaining ingredients.  To compliment the dish, I served an Italian salad and homemade cheddar biscuits.  Yum Yum!!",

Added a slurry (about 2 tsp cornstarch and 1/4 cup milk) to the chicken sauce to thicken it up. One surprising thing...chicken pieces still were a little on the bland side even though it was cooked in that salty italian dressing. My fiance made the suggestion of marinating the chicken in your choice of marinade before cooking. I think italian sausage will work well with this recipe too.",
