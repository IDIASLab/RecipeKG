Although I didn't use fresh onion it seems that the patties would have trouble holding together with that much onion. 1 small onion is a lot of onion for only 1 lb of beef. These were not quite as moist as the jalapeno/cheddar burger with the cheese mixed in but still good enough for a thumbs up. Thanks Steve.",
