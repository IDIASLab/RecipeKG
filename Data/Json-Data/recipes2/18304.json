You might want to either use a thick frosting or remove the insides before cutting. Another thing I discovered...when I baked the brownie I wanted it to be a bit smaller then the bun so I cut the edge off first. This really made it look like ground beef.

Not only did I receive many compliments as I carried the cake down the hallway but it was also one of the first ones chosen! I can't vouch for how it tastes since I didn't eat it but it was very easy to make. I simplified the recipe by omitting the \"bacon \" wrapping whole vanilla wafers (instead of halves) in fruit leather using yellow fruit leather for the \"cheese \" instead of fruit-flavored candy and using yellow and red decorator icing for the \"mustard\" and \"ketchup.\" I also cut the green fruit leather in strips to look like shredded lettuce. By the way my local grocery store sells boxes of fruit leather in primary colors but they have \"tongue tattoos\" on them. I felt that the tattoos weren't that noticeable and were pretty easy to hide under the bun.",

                "reviewBody": "I had so much fun making this cake! I didn't really go by the instructions though...just took it as more of an idea to base mine on as I wanted to make it super easy and not so sugary (low fat burger?). I used one box of golden cake split into 2 round pans for the bun. One box of choc cake put into a square pan and then cut into a circle for the patty. As others suggested this makes it look more like meat with the rough edge. i should have put it in a rectangular pan though b/c I think the burger turned out too thick. I thought the bun looked better without icing plus I didn't want a super sweet cake. I used kiwi fruit (lettuce) strawberries (tomatoes) and mango slices (cheese). Important to blot the fruit dry so they won't slide out and I should have cut them thinner too so they wouldn't slip as much. I used a container of vanilla icing (mayo) on each side in between the burger and bun on each side to hold everything together. I put a little icing on each Rice Krispy to make the sesame seeds as I saw someone else do on here. My boyfriend says the sesame seeds are the thing that makes it look so great. I brought it over to my friend's BBQ and it was a SMASH HIT. This cake makes people happy. My next plan is to make sliders!;0)",
