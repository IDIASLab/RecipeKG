I always make it around the holidays, or for football and hockey game nights. Everyone begs for this recipe. Turn this into a pub spread by adding a half cup of your favorite dark ale. Use brick cream cheese for a spread, or spreadable cream cheese for a dip. Serve with crispy crackers, toast, or bagels.",
