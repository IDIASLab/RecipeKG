(I microwaved the potatoes for 3 minutes first) I browned the chicken and potatoes and seasoned them with garlic salt, pepper and mrs dash. I then saut\u00e9ed fresh red peppers, onions and garlic and topped the chicken and potatoes with it. For the soup mixture I added cheddar cheese soup instead of a cup of cheese and plenty of seasoning. I poured it over the top and baked. Then I topped the dish with 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup pepper jack and the crumbled bacon and browned 10 more minutes ! It turned out to be delicious! Even my 6yr old (who hates potatoes) loved it.",

I am not a fan of cream of chicken so I used cream of celery as I usually do and a mixture of cheddar and velveeta for the cheese. Sometimes I make this with cubed ham and broccoli instead of chicken and bacon. Both variations are really good and my 4 kids devour it. Anything all your children will eat is a plus in my book!!",
