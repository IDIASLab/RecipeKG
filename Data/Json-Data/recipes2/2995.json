Oh my - were these good! Great flavor combination and very juicy and flavorful.  Cooked to medium (which is usually not my comfort zone - prefer medium rare) the burger was fabulous!  Put in the freezer for about 10 minutes before cooking to ensure that they held together,  Thanks for the great way to use ground pork!",

I added finely diced jalape\u00f1os & onion that I saut\u00e9ed before adding them to the mixed pork. The Worcester, Chuolulas hot sauce, French feta cheese, salt and pepper. I also went light on the salt because of the saltiness of the cheese. I will definitely be making these again, thank you!",
