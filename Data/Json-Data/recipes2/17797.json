Got lovely prosciutto di Parma which was less salty than others, and had a subtle rich flavor.  Trimmed off fat.  Followed another users advice and made a balsamic reduction into which we added ground anise, black pepper and a little chile oil for a slow and surprising heat to counter all the sweet.  Then, to continue with the Meditteranean theme, served alongside of Black figs paired with a locally made goat cheese (very delicate and chewy without the pungent goat flavor) and homemade crispy sweet potato fries.  Yummy!!!",

I cut my prosciutto into 3 skinny strips (lengthwise) & used just one strip per ball but I think it was still too much prosciutto. I think next time I will cut some off of the length of it (it won't go to waste...I'll add it to a sald or something) & leave just enough to wrap. I chopped the mint & added it to the lime juice...using toothpicks to secure the prosciutto. I also used the larger end of the melon baller & wish I had made smaller balls. Mine were a little big to just pop in your mouth. I want to try this again as a side salad & not as an appetizer... I'll follow Caroline C. & chop the prosciutto instaed of wrapping.",
