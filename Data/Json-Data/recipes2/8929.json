The horseradish mustard does not lend much flavor(I should have realized from the small amount called for) so I would mix some with the spinach before stuffing or serve some on the side next time because that was part of what drew me to this recipe. We liked the smoked gouda and unlike some experienced, it melted enough that a little started to ooze out near the end of baking.",
