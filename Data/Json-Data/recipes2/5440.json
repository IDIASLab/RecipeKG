The results were restaurant quality--the flavors were superb.  I used grouper that husband had caught himself in the Gulf of Mexico.  I used a Sauvignon Blanc and it was perfect.  I probably used a lot less butter than called for, plus I had to cook a very thick piece of grouper about 15 minutes longer.  I'm saving this in my Fish collection on this site and will use it again.",
