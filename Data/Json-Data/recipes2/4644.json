Well, I\u2019ll never again throw away a hot dog bun because this worked GREAT, and the kids are gonna love it too (maybe without the hot sauce).  In the future, I\u2019ll just jazz it up a little like I do with scrambled eggs or an omelet, and add some shredded cheese, chives, chopped ham, bell pepper, onion, whatever.  I did toast the bun and added salt and pepper to this simple Egg Dog.  Honestly, I thought this recipe was a bit of joke, but I\u2019ll admit it, I was wrong.  What fun!!!",

I added a little salt and pepper to the egg before cooking it. I had a package of 'Top Sliced' hot dog buns and it fit perfectly in the bun. Having rolled the egg it made for a nice bit of egg in every bite. I'm going to share this with my extended family as they will get a kick out of eating an egg this way. I will be doing this more often from now on. Thanks Seth for adding a little fun to an egg sandwich!",

If I had some sausage or ham that would've put the cherry on the shake. Salsa or ketchup too. What you've made should be known to all people my friend. This dish should be on every persons table in the morning. Definitely making again. 5 stars 10/10 whatever u wanna call it the legendary egg dog is number one.",
