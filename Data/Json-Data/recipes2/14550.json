It's also much healthier than some of the marshmallow fruit dips especially if you use the cool whip free. I made it the other day for a party and decided to divide the cool whip and use a container and a half of 2 types of yogurt in each. It makes so much and I wanted 2 varieties. My guests went nuts over it and couldn't believe how simple it was. I suggest yoplait key lime pie and strawberry for 2 great flavors. I also used the left overs for fruit parfaits and added some granola.",
