Even though \"double roast\" them sliced for another 25 minutes, the temperature is still too low and not enough cooking to cure the initial mistake.  If you want soft, juicy beets that aren't raw then try slicing first and cooking them at 400-425 for about an hour.  After that you can mix in whatever you want and cook them more.",

I didn't double anything else as my beet greens this time of year (Sept. in Colorado) are getting dry.  Actually it took two beets to get enough tender small beet greens to make one cup. I used olive oil, pecans and seasoned rice vinegar; that's what I had on hand. I recommend an 8\" X 8\" baking dish for this recipe. If you double the beets you'll need a 7\" X 11\" dish or larger, the beets need to be one layer in dish. Suggestion: toast walnuts and beet the night before so you won't have so many steps and you only have to bake the second day for 15 minutes. Thanks John",
