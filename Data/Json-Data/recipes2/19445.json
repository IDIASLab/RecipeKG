We also substituted lemon juice since we had no lime. This recipe has a nice sort of Mexican flavor to it. With only three people eating there was a bunch leftover and we're excited to use those in burritos tomorrow. Last note--we three were all first time venison eaters and we didn't notice any funny taste or smell at all. The meat was delicious and very accessible tasting.",

I am always looking for different recipes for venison because its something we always have in the freezer. I've only got a couple recipes for cube steaks so this was a great way to utilize them and give them a kick ! I prefer to use banana peppers or jalapenos in place of chipotles out of personal preference. I also like another reviewer dropped them into a deep fryer instead of using a skillet. This has a permanent place in the rotation at our house !",

Used lemon instead of lime bc that's what I had and there's really no marinade to drain off so you basically just toss the venison in flour. Thinking the third time around we might try deep frying it for extra crispy coating. Thank you for sharing- will definetly make again!!!",
