Yes dill. My husband used to work at a restaurant where they made tomato dill soup and it was awesome so we tried it and it really tasted good! It says it serves 6 but we ate it as a meal so three people max along with homemade wheat rolls. A-MAZING!! Definitely bland without the additions.",

The second batch I used red onions lots of garlic better quality lump crab meat and added some cajun seasoning at the end to give it a little kick. This batch bursts with flavor. Regardless of how you spice it up you definitely need to use quality lump crab meat it's sweeter and more flavorful.

I'm sure that my toddler would have ate this but I decided to give him a kid friendly meal instead. I did use a can of evaporated milk and garlic powder instead of the half and half cream along with fresh garlic. Also I added a small can of tomato sauce because I thought it was a little on the watery side. This fixed it for sure. I added dill like someone recommended previously. Also I added a little marjoram along with salt and pepper. When I served it I put mozzarella along with parmesan cheese on top of it. It was a complete meal with focaccia bread served on the side that I got at our local grocery store. The only thing that I may do different in the future is puree this soup and then add the crab along with the evaporated milk or the half and half cream after pureeing it. Overall this recipe is a keeper and will make its way to my kitchen table again:). Thanks for sharing it with all of us. This would also be wonderful with a spinach salad of some type.",
