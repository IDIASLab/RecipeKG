If you want a hot dog sauce that is easy fast and suits everyone you've found it! Great job Nancy -- you bailed me out of a mess (ruined another recipe sauce that took 6 hours and wasn't nearly as good as this one anyway). I realize that this recipe was posted to yield a particular commercial sauce but I'll use this one as a base sauce make a few changes just to suit my own tastes in the future. Next time I'll dice a real onion use prepared mustard and increase (slightly) the catsup and worcestershire sauce. I'll probably add a diced green pepper too and jump the cooking time to 90 minutes adding chicken stock as needed to keep it from scorching. Again thanks so much for sharing you recipe Nancy -- great stuff. Pat the old Bone Man.",
