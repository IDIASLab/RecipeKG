I didn't add the full amount of pepper (personal preference) and left some of the skin on the hazelnuts (to save time) and my guests gobbled it up! Very unique flavor but not too bizarre for picky eaters. Whole coriander and cumin seed are easy to find and cheap at Indian markets. Will definitely make again!!!",
