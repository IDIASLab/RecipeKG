Those who complained that the Italian dressing is too wet may not have noticed the directions where it says \"top with 3 or 4 splashes of Italian dressing\". My interpretation of that is that you just add enough to moisten the vegetables. For me that meant less than the 2 tablespoons listed in the ingredients. I prefer this cold though rather than heated in the microwave and with thin sliced cheese instead of grated.",
