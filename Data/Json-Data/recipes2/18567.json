I don't measure seasonings very well just sorta eyeball it. I marinaded this for about four hours using boneless skinless breasts. I put this in a glass dish with about 1/2 the marinade sauce and baked at 400 deg F for about 30 min (int temp 180 deg). This came out SUPER tender and juicy. I will definitely make this again and probably try it with pork chops or tenderloin. The ginger really added a nice flavor. Thanks for the suggestions!",

I added chopped ginger and a few tablesppons of honey to make it more glazey otherwise its a little runny. I think I would also marinade overnight (I only did 5 hours and could not taste the flavor all the way through.) I also would grate some orange peel in next time. Would be great on wings/drumsticks.

I marinated the chicken overnight and then broiled it for 20 minutes flipping it at 10 minutes and brushing some of the marinade on it. I dumped the remaining marinade into a pot and boiled it for a little while until it reduced and then spooned a little over the chicken. I served the chicken with brown rice and garnished with some chopped green onions. Very good! I'll definitely be adding this to the rotation.",
