It's usually a 'there's nothing in the house' type of thing and made with a carton of broth. Even in its quick-and-easy form it's a delicious and comforting meal, but when you use a fresh whole chicken, it becomes epic. Garnish with parsley and lemon zest.",

Too long of a cook time after adding the rice.  I'd let the stock simmer with the saut\u00e9ed onions for 30 min or so before adding the Arborio.   Think I may skip adding it to the soup at all, cook it on the side and add into the individual bowl of soup when serving.  Rice and Pasta tend to turn to glue goop when they sit in a pot of soup.

After I pull my chicken to shred the meat I usually make a bone broth by returning the bones, scraps, and skin to the stock pot to simmer for hours.

I recommend making the soup    (broth part) a day ahead, let it sit in the fridge over night so the fat rises and the next day, after skimming fat, finish the remainder of the recipe..for those who need a lower fat  soup.  Wonderful flavor taste delicious !   Thank you so much Chef John :) we have made many of your recipes  and have enjoyed each and everyone !",
