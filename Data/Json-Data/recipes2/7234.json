I also microwaved the eggs. I crumbled the sausage to speed up the cooking process. I omitted the ham because I don t care for ham. I zapped the cheese covered potatoes in the microwave for 30 seconds to melt the cheese. So while not drastic changes they all worked beautifully. This was a hearty and delicious dish great with a glass of milk. This is a tasty way to start your day.",

I followed the recipe with just a slight twist: I used some Italian sausage because that's what I had on hand and I also added a couple of cut mushrooms to the mix. Next time I'd definitely add a slice of toast. I used russets for this recipe but next time I will absolutely use little red potatoes because I had way too many for our taste using the russets. I wasn't sure about how to use the bacon but either cut up or whole as I served it works well. A cold glass of milk was definitely a plus! We declared that this will be a keeper! Thanks Sandra! I think my whole family will enjoy this!",
