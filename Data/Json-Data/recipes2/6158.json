The stems have a celery like texture with a mild spicy flavor and works very well chopped into the greens.     I grow greens in my garden and these are much better than store bought greens.   Young mustard greens have a mild flavor with a hint of spiciness.    After washing I roll the leaves to cut into strips. Towards the end I cut the thicker stems into a smaller dice or remove and dice... If the stems are tough woody or bitter it is likely you do not want to use that leaf also as it will be bitter too.   ... You can use mustard stems the same as you would celery, raw or cooked.    Try mustard sticks with pimento cheese.\n\nOther than removing the mustard stems, I have no problem with recipe.  I do as always for any recipe, reduce salt to  less than half and add back if needed.",
