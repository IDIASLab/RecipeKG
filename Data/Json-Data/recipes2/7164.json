I added a pinch of sugar replaced the raisins for semisweet chocolate chips and about 1/4 of a cup marshmallow cream. Then I made a ganache or frosting mixture on the stove that I didn't measure but used cocoa powder peanut butter some salt (barley!) and some more marshmallow creme adding milk as needed to thin it out. Putting it on top it was excellent! I would say that you might want to add salt to the granola because it was a tiny bit sweet. All in all a great recipe base.",
