I added shrimp to it. The Sriracha sauce was spicy enough without adding any more spice. I cannot see this being a great recipe for kids unless the kids like super spicy food. Overall I really didn't like the recipe and would have liked it less with the amount of marinara indicated. I believe this would be better with sausage or something other than nothing. Even the shrimp I added just acquired the taste of the spice. I love spicy foods but this wasn't a great dish in my opinion. I believe it could be made to taste a lot better but it seemed like a cross between an Italian dish and an Asian one and it wasn't quite cutting it for me.",
