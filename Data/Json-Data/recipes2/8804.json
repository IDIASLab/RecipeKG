I seasoned the fish mixture with garlic salt, onion powder, old bay, S&P, for a little change up, curry & ginger (just a little was enough). Mix together with noodles & baked for 35 minutes.

(2 cups) and made it with small elbow macaroni.  I increased the shredded cheese to about 3 cups and increased the tuna to 12 oz.  I also decreased the bread crumbs to 1/4 cup.  You could add some salt but I just salted it when served.  I left the remaining ingredients as is as well as the cooking time and while it doesn't specify, I baked it uncovered.  It would serve about 3 people.  If I want to make more then I'll just take the changes and those unchanged and double it.  It came out nice and creamy, flavorful and perfect!  When I made it with the original measurements it was very dry and not very flavorful, hence the 3 stars.  But with the changes, it's 5 stars!",

I went short on the pasta and I did think one more can of tuna could have been used (I used Costco's 6 oz can but most of the regular brands now are only 5 oz---so definitely two cans needed there). This was just a good easy meal! Thanks for the recipe!",
