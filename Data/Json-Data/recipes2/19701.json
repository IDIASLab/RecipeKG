Squeeze in real lime and add thai basil if you can find it and/or kaffir lime leaves (these keep well in the freezer). Another name for this is Tom Ka Gai soup.Very yummy! I like to use mushrooms, lemongrass and onions instead of broccoli making it more of a Tom Ka Gain soup.  Also for gluten free makes sure you check the chicken stock you use as most commercial stocks are NOT gluten free!",
