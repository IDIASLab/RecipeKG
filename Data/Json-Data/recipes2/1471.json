My cookies ended up rising way more than in the pic, so the final product was more rounded that flat, but still tasty. I do have to point out that the recipe makes WAY too much frosting. You could easily get away with cutting the frosting recipe in half. It also is really thick and hard to beat, so you'll likely need to add in additional milk. The icing is also very sweet, so you don't want to overdo it.   Using parchment paper really simplified the baking process. I followed the recipe exactly (well, except I used freshly grated nutmeg in a slightly reduced amount because of its potency) and I made sure I rolled each ball the same size (they were 30g each raw, and yes I'm crazy!). This ended up making 36 cookies, so 18 sandwiches.",

Didn't even have to wash the cookies sheets after.. just slid the paper off and it was clean!  I didn't make sandwiches but just frosted each cookie on top.  I did cut the cookie recipe in 1/2 and the frost recipe in 1/4 and there was still too much frosting for the 20 cookies.  Can't imagine how much frosting they think you need for sandwich cookies.  I'm glad I tried these!  #AllstarsReynolds",
