It came out just fine doing it that way.  I also used chickpea pasta instead of regular pasta...couldn't even tell the difference.  May add a touch more salt next time, but will definitely make again!",

For melting the butter, honestly, use a soup bowl in the microwave and put it in the dish washer when you're done !\nThis recipe didn't take me any more time or effort than my usual macaroni and cheese recipe. I liked the  flavor from the onion and garlic and the addition of broccoli made this an easy one dish meal. My minor changes were using  4 wedges of the \"laughing cow\" cheese for cream cheese and Panko bread crumbs for regular. I was out of those 2 ingredients.",
