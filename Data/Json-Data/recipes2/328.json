I went on a search for a country gravy recipe and am so glad I found this. I didn't have green onion on hand so I just finely diced some regular onions and saut\u00e9ed them right along with the meat. I had to use extra milk since it was kind of thick for me but that was an easy fix. I like my country gravy to take on a slightly deeper color so I added a few drops of browning sauce. I added the cayenne but next time I'll leave it out - not my thing. Sausage and bacon combined with the onion takes country gravy to a whole new level! Loved it! Thanks Chef John!",
