After researching the many potato recipes on this site, I chose this one; the shredded pepper jack cheese caught my attention.  However, I did tone the spices down, omitting the red pepper flakes, as a few of the family cannot eat spicy foods.  But I did add crumbled bacon to the mix and substituted freshly cut green onions as a final topping.  What a hit this was!  The casserole dish was emptied, which speaks volumes by our extended family!",
