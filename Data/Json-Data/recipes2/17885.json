I added a cup of water and bullion to the veggies so they would cook in the skillet tossed in some kielbasa sausage and baked the chicken instead of boiling. Worked well; it was pretty spicy although I think that might've been my fault; I think I put in more cayenne than I meant to. Still tasted pretty good though. I halved this and it was plenty for dinner with enough for a good size serving leftover. Thanks for the recipe.",
