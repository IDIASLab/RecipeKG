The 2 minced cloves of garlic do impart a light garlic flavor. I found that 1 3/4 of a cup was basically equivalent to a 14.5 oz can of Swanson Broth. I used the Natural Goodness 33% less sodium type. 4 cups of vegetables seems like a lot but after cooking it is maybe 3 servings as a side dish. I ended up with quite a bit of leftover broth. So I am saving it to steam some more tomorrow or the next day. Also watch the vegetables carefully. I cooked them for 5 minutes as an initially suggested time and they were very tender. Next time I am going to try 3 minutes as I prefer a little more crispness myself. This is a very healthy way to prepare vegetables.",
