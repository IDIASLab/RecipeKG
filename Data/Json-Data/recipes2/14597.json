I used lowfat sweet condensed milk and vanilla wafers.  I used 1% milk and lite vanilla wafers.  The recipe calls for 14 banana's, but I think that was too many unless you really like bananas.  I used only 9 or ten. Also the recipe call for a 12 ounce container of whipped topping.  I didn't find the 12, it was 10oz or 16oz, so I used the 16oz.  It made the pudding mixture more creamy.  And one last thing, you don't need a 16oz box of vanilla wafers, the 12oz box worked great for me.  I used a 13x9 baking glass dish and it turned out great.  I hope my review helps.",

I have made this at least three times in the past month.  The only change I made was to decrease the whipped topping to 8 ounces in order to taste the pudding flavor more.  My glass bowl isn't as big I guess because I use only about 3 to 5 bananas and I don't measure the wafers - just layer any amount!!!  I also have enough to make a small bowl and send home with my 2 granddaugters I care for - they LOVE this banana pudding too.",

Instead of this, just whip up a pint of cream (don't add sugar!) and fold that into the extra sweetened pudding mix (after it has solidified).
