I used skinless salmon and it cooked much quicker than the 23 minutes that the auto cook mode wanted to cook it (adjusting for 1 lb vs 2 in the recipe). I think with fish you just really need to keep an eye on it until it is firm in the middle. I couldn't find mango chutney in my grocery store so I made my own using the recipe on this site. I served this with basmati rice which went well with the chutney. Thanks Bibi!",
