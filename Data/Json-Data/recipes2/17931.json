Also because red hots are used instead of cinnamon there is no sludgy spice residue left in the bottom of the cup...but be careful if you drip...it stains!",

Nice holiday alternative to the usual nog etc. Please note however the cinamon candies they are talking about in this recipe are not the chewy kind but the cinamon hearts that you get near valentines (I figured this out when I tried to disolve them and after 1 hour they had still not disolved). Instead I substitued cinamon sticks as I couldn't for the life of me find those candies at this time of year (Christmas) so I think it lacked the real cinamon kicker but still very good. Next Valentines I will stock up on those candies so I have some for next year as I imagine it would be superb done by the recipe. I made it for a big family get together smelled the house up real nice and everyone really liked it. I was even asked to make it for Christmas supper instead of the usual tea after supper. It really does make a ton! Next time I will make half the recipe and if it's getting close to gone and not almost bedtime I will make the second batch!",
