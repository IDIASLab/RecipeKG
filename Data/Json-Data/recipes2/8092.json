The only substitution I made was instead of 2 cups of almond flour I used 1 cup of almond flour and 1 cup of Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Baking Mix. I pressed the cookies out a little bit because they do not spread with the substitution I made. I don't know if they spread with using all almond flour. I will definitely make these cookies again.
