As the first reviewer of this recipe I had no warnings or tips to go by yet I think I should have known this would flop. With pudding yogurt and then a whole can of coconut milk I think I should have recognized that it was all just too much for one little ol' cake mix to support! The result was heavy and dense almost wet with no crumb to speak of and barely resembled cake. Perhaps this is what the submitter intended? As for the frosting I didn't even try it. I knew a mere cup of confectioners' sugar for one package of cream cheese just wasn't going to work. I opted to use another cream cheese frosting recipe but it didn't matter as the entire cake with all its many ingredients was tossed.",
