Don't hesitate to use the microwave version - you'll never go back to the old way again. Other cereal favorites include cocoa krispies and \"fruity pebbles\" (generics are equally good). My super-secret tip: Pour the melted mix over the cereal (in a huge plastic mixing bowl) and not the other way - the cereal dust coats the plastic bowl and prevents the marshmallow (and everything else) from sticking to the bowl. \r\nGreat ideas for add-ins everyone! I'll try the peanut butter this year!",
