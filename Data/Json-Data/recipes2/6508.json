Wasn't too sweet at all! If you find it too sweet add more mayo. It's a fool proof recipe! I even made this slightly healthier by using fat-free mayo. I served this with fish sticks and this sauce is so much better than tartar sauce which my family is not fond of. My hubby is the only tartar sauce fan in the family and even he is now a convert! I've already made this 3 times and now I also add in some lemon pepper seasoning to mine and hubby's sauce the kids like it without. Thank you for the recipe!",
