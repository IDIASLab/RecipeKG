I didn't have any nutmeg or sherry so I improvised a bit: I substituted the nutmeg for a high-quality cinnamon (Penzey's) and added just a pinch of cayenne pepper and a few dashes of hot sauce. Also I didn't have enough of one kind of cheese to cover the whole thing so I used a combo of white and regular cheddar. It was FABULOUS! I think the tiny bit of heat in the background adds a lot. I think it would be even better with a firmer bread though. Great twist on bread pudding!:)",

Because I didn't have bacon I sliced up and saut\u00e9ed 3 small onions because we love onions & they're good for you. I also used multigrain bread but omitted the buttering because we don't need extra fat. Still the dish turned out very well and was delicious. A note about the sherry... It would be a shame to leave it out. It imparts a lovely flavour to the dish. It's reason enough to keep a bottle of sherry on hand! Thanks for this marvellous dinner idea. Bread pudding isn't just dessert!",

Cooked it in a square 9 inch pan rather than a pie plate. Definitely soft and savoury a nice mild breakfast dish. Will make it again but try to kick it up another notch. Needs some salt and pepper in the eggy mixture maybe some hot sauce. I'll also probably use less cheese as the amount stated here felt like waaay too much just as a topping!",
