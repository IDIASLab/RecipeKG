I felt there was too much soy sauce. I think it might be good with the Balsamic Vinegar and olive oil and just a drizzle of soy but that's probably a personal taste preference. I love raw cabbage and I thought it tasted better raw then this recipe/combination. I might try it again but use less soy and see if that makes a difference for us. Thanks!",
