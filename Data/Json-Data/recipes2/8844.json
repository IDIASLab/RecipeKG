I love, love bearnaise sauce, and wanted to try it from scratch for a change for Easter dinner. Takes a long time to prep, which I knew going in.  But here's where I flubbed up; I have a god-awful electric stovetop, so I struggle sometimes with cooking techniques that are very temperature sensitive.  I was skeptical about putting my stainless steel mixing bowl on an electric burner, so I decided to use a double boiler.  All was well until the \"stir for 8-10 minutes\" part near the end.  It took only 30 seconds for the sauce to thicken and I wasn't prepared.   When the sauce was finished, it was beautiful and velvety for a minute.  However, it was much too vinegary for me and had gotten too thick,  and I decided that I needed to \"water it down\" a little, which I did by adding more butter.   The taste was fabulous, texture was great, and I thought I had won, but after sitting on the stovetop for two minutes, it separated and curdled.   I could not rescue it.  So, my advice to you is...if you don't have a really good grasp on emulsification, don't try to veer from Chef John's directions at all. My fault entirely, but hopefully I'll spare someone else the disappointment.",
