Hopefully Allrecipes will see this error and correct it. I assumed it was to be put inside the pizza roll and it was the first thing I put down on the dough. I just couldn t see only ground beef and onion so I did add some Italian seasoning garlic powder and crushed red pepper flakes. I did let the ground beef mixture cool a bit but it still was a bit of a struggle rolling this up but it did bake up looking O.K. Be prepared to eat this with a fork because you won t be able to eat it with your hands. I m not sure I d use both cheddar and mozzarella cheeses the next time (just couldn t taste both of them); most likely I ll just stick with mozzarella. We love pizza in this house it was nice having something other than a round traditional pie and it turned out pretty well.",

Instead of making one big pizza roll I rolled the dough out very thin and made several smaller ones. They were easier to eat that way and I froze the leftovers. I'm hoping they'll reheat well for a quick lunch or dinner. Update: Freezing them worked really well! After defrosting I threw them in my toaster oven and they made for a nice fast hot meal with no fuss.",
