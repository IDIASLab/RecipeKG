And I added about a cup and a half of cooked quinoa along with one bag of frozen cauliflower rice again because it is what I had on-hand. Also I made my own cajun seasoning blend (2 1/2 tablespoons paprika 2 tablespoons salt 2 tablespoons garlic powder 1 tablespoon black pepper 1 tablespoon onion powder 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried thyme) and used about 3 teaspoons of it in place of the cajun seasoning and other seasonings listed since it was all about the same stuff.
