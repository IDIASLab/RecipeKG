I've been making this soup for myself my whole college career, since it's a soup my mom made when I was growing up.  This soup is illegally easy and incredibly good for you.  Eat it up!  You can add sliced, shredded, or diced cooked chicken to the soup when it is almost ready.  This soup is delicious, but it can be a surprisingly dull color.  You can make it more attractive by serving it with a thin slice of lemon on top and a sprinkle of chopped parsley or chives.",

I used 4 cloves of garlic sauteed with the onion and 2 bay leaves for 5 minutes. Then I added all the other ingredients plus a generous shake of parsley and paprika. I also added 1 chopped fresh tomato and cut spinach (stems removed). I had to add extra liquid to compensante for how much liquid the lentils absorbed. The cumin is what absolutely makes this soup!",

Here's what I did a little differently from the recipe thanks to the suggestions of my fellow reviewers: I used 3 cloves of garlic (never too much!). I thinly sliced 3 carrots and added them. I used the entire 6 oz. can of tomato paste. I dumped in a bunch of garlic powder. I sauteed the garlic and onions together for just a few minutes before I added everything else. I simmered the soup for 45 minutes and it made it nice and thick. This recipe is a total keeper. I plan on keeping the ingredients around all the time. Thanks so much for such a great recipe!",

When my teenagers will eat a hearty healthy soup like this one and ask for seconds we have success. I sauteed the onion 4 cloves of garlic and two bay leaves in olive oil then added the rest of the ingredients including two chicken bullion cubes since I keep my homemade stock on the plain side. I salted and peppered throughout the cooking process as needed and even added a dash or two of garlic powder at the end. I think one must look at this as a soup that one must season to taste.
