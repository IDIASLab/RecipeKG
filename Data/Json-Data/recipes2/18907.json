First of all I thought the pepperoni was really bland; some good-quality salty proscuitto would have been better. Some fresh herbs wouldn't have done any harm either. Finally if you are going to serve it as I did alongside a sauceless piece of meat I think a rich creamy Parmesan sauce would be wonderful.

I also used sliced green onion instead of the white onion and some feta cheese.  I put a couple of dots of cream cheese on the bottom of the zucchini boats before adding the remaining ingredients and it was so good and creamy!  My kids absolutely loved it - especially the mozarella on top.  My nine-month old ate nearly an entire half by himself! We had guests over and I made it again, and that's all they would talk about.  I used 8 zucchinis since our garden was overflowing with them, and I will definitely make this again!!!",

I added a smear of cream cheese to the bottom of the boats before putting the fillings in as someone else suggested doing. I used a grapefruit spoon to scoop out the middles. On the bigger squash I mistakenly left too much rind - make sure you scoop them as thin as you can. This recipe did take me closer to 25 min to prep but that's probably because it was my first time trying to stuff a zucchini! Great recipe I'll be buying a lot more zucchini in my weekly trips to the farmers market!",
