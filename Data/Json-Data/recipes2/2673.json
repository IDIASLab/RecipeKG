I had a 5.5oz box of instant vanilla pudding so I used that with 3 cups milk (followed the boxes instructions) and then used about 1/2 C crushed cookies in the pudding and about 3/4C crushed on top. It was definitely less than a whole box of cookies and maybe still too much.  I'm not sure if it was the extra cup of milk or the fact it didn't have other ingredients like cream cheese in it but my pudding didn't really \"set\" very well. This was fine though since it was just for the kids and they didn't notice. Maybe next time I'll try with the 2 cups milk and still less cookie crumbs.  Thanks for the quick, easy and tasty recipe!",

If you don t have gummy worms you can use 2 flavored gummy lifesavers and break them in half so they look like gummy worms. Overall it was very good but could use a little less whipped cream.",
