I found this recipe thinking if I don't like it my husband will surely eat it all for dinner and leftovers. I loved this recipe. Tastes as good or better than any cheese soup recipe I have ever had. I sliced the shiitakes really thin. I used a whole yellow onion and threw in half a bunch of sliced swiss chard (w/ stems) as I had some to use up. I omitted the sage due to a lack of it and used 2 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of milk in lieu of the beef broth. Prior to adding the liquids I added three tablespoons of flour and browned everything together. I increased the amount of cheese to adjust for the increase in onion addition of swiss chard. I served it in bowls topped with chopped green onion. Fabulous!",
