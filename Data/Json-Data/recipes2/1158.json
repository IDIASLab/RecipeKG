Since I didn't have half-and-half I used 2% milk instead and you can't even tell that it's lightened up. Seriously. Soooo creamy and delicious! If you like red hots you will love this ice cream. Thanks Scott I'm adding it to my favorites!",

Made it in our gallon size freezer and wanted a full batch so used a pint of heavy cream a quart of half and half and finished with whole milk. Also used 3 eggs and added a half cup of sugar. Still had plenty of flavor even with the extra liquid. You can actually feel the heat from the red hots in the ice cream!! Loved it!!",

It was so smooth and creamy and is complemented by the cinnamon burn that is slight but noticeable. As a fan of fireballs and cinnamon Altoids this ice cream is amazing! Even my teenage son was complimentary of it. Thank you for the recipe! EDIT: One thing I noticed was a slight waxy texture which I believe is from the food grade wax they have to put on the candies to keep them from sticking together. To remedy this I instead used 2 packages of the Red Hot candy sticks ( http://www.taquitos.net/candy/Bobs-Red-Hots-Cinnamon_Sticks ) that I found at Cracker Barrel. DEFINITELY made a difference in the texture. still an AMAZING recipe though.",
