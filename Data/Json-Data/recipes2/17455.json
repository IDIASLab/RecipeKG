Everyone who tasted it couldn't get enough and no one could tell what the secret ingredient was- although they knew it was there. I made four batches last night and can't wait to make more! Add a little aged rum and WOW (look for a # on the bottle or \"anejo\" for aged rum). To the person who used Chilli powder- that's not even close. Cayanne give heat not flavor. Chilli peppers do the opposite. I bet with Chilli it was gross. You should try it again with Cayenne you'll love it.",

A good day to stay inside be cozy and drink hot chocolate. This recipe took a little time to make- melting the chocolate adding the egg then the milk and heating it slowly. But it's worth it. I used a Pyrex bowl on top of a pan of simmering water and did the whole recipe in the bowl. My husband was on hand to help me make this and I was glad when I got to the adding milk to egg part. Two pairs of hands are helpful there. I only added a dash of cayenne. The whole family enjoyed this- the babies had thiers with a candy cane stirrer.",
