As far as modifications I followed the advice of many other reviewers and added my \"breadcrumbs\" to the mixture before cooking them. However I used quinoa flakes for some added protein for my growing boys. I also soak the quinoa flakes in milk first (until they are just soaked through but not enough milk to make them sopping wet. Most true Italian meatballs call for breadcrumbs soaked in milk which I think helps bind them better. This recipe is versatile. I've used broccoli and carrots or zucchini and carrots and both were excellent. You definitely need to squeeze the liquid out of the zucchini and onions. Also I recommend letting the whole mixture sit covered in the fridge overnight or all day before baking- the flavors meld and everything just tastes better. I like to make mini-meatballs and these freeze really well for quick kids dinners.",
