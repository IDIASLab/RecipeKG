I SOOO didn't want to fry potatoes tonite and I only had 30 minutes until I wanted to be serving my bbq pork sammies and cole slaw, but needed something else for a side dish. I used my apple corer to make some quick potato wedges, covered 'em in water and threw 'em in the microwave for 5 min. I sprayed the baking sheet with oil, dried the taters with a paper towel and sprayed again with oil after putting them on the sheet, then sprinkled on the season salt. 25 min at 400 deg made these nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I WILL NEVER FRY POTATOES AGAIN!! Thanks so much :-)",

I put the fries on the cookie sheet and lightly drizzled with oil until they were coated and then added the seasoned salt. I did flip 2 times while baking to achieve the color and crispiness I wanted. Family loved them and that is all that mattered. The fries were served with BAR CHICKS Blackened Chicken Sliders another AR recipe. I would make fries with this recipe again.",
