I wanted a sweet option to use up some steel-cut oats; omitted rice flour, flax seeds, arrowroot powder, butter, and cranberry juice. Used unsweetened applesauce, about 1 c unbleached wheat flour and 1/2 c bread flour, added 1/2 tsp. of ground cloves, and about 1 c. of shredded carrots and 1/4 c. orange-mango 100% juice blend. Before baking, I topped them with a third/third/third mix of brown sugar/crushed almonds/cinnamon (total of about 1/8 c. topping). These were VERY moist, and delicious when I drizzled the tops with some cream cheese icing. Very easy recipe to modify, probably nice as written, too!",

I have a daughter who is severely allergic, and this is the first baked item she has loved with rice flour as a base.  I say thats fantastic!  \r\nI altered it by subbing 1/4 c. applesauce for the egg, also necessarily doubling the leavening baking soda ( i added a tsp of homemade baking powder (1/2 and 1/2 cream of tarter and baking soda), and instead of juice I added 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/3 c. water (more water is needed without the egg).  They turned out the best i have ever made with rice flour of anything.  yay!",

I actually bake the entire dough in an oven dish and spoon it out.  It's easier to eat when it's not baked in paper muffin cups.",
