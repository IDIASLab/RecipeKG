I chose this particular recipe because it gave about a 1 cup proportion and I was just wanting to try it out. I practiced with some roses to get a feel for it at first. Another recipe said to use cocoa for sticking. I didn't really have any problem with that except for on my hands just a tad but wetting my hands stopped that. I would like to try this using real white chocolate. I think the whitish flowers look so pretty. I had Nestle dark chocolate chips in the house so I used that. These would be very pretty on a plain chocolate cake. I had no idea what the sprinkles were for so I did not use them. I just wish the directions stated the best way to store this for later use or how long it will last? But I guess I could just look that up.",
