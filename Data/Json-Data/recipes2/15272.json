Making caramel sauce from scratch is soooo much easier than babysitting a can for 3 hours!  What you need:  1 cup Sugar, 6 Tablespoons Butter, 1/2 cup Heavy Cream.  Have the butter and cream measured out and on hand when you begin.  Whisk 1 cup of sugar in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat until sugar dissolves.  Once the sugar starts boiling - do not whisk just swirl the pan.  When the sugar turns an amber color add the butter and swirl until melted.  Remove pan from heat and count to 3 - then slowly pour the cream into the pan, swirling until incorporated - then whisk until mixture is smooth.  Pour into mason (glass) jars and allow to cool.  Can be kept refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.  Easily done in less than 10 minutes and tastes much better!  ",

Ok, so my experience is this: I have boiled DOZENS and DOZENS of cans of condensed milk, and I can assure anyone that IT IS COMPLETELY SAFE TO DO SO. My only advice is 1. Make sure you keep topping up the water, and do not let the pan boil dry. 2. Be careful when opening the can: I wrap the can in an old towel, because some of the very hot caramel sauce does ooze out of the puncture hole a little. By the way, the 'sauce' will turn out very very thick and gloopy - NOT a syrupy pourable consistency.",

                "reviewBody": "People, People, People.  My greatgrandmother, grandmother, mother and now myself have been boiling Eagle Brand Condensed milk for a century and half. Some reviews said that the cans were exploding, easy resolution. 1. Do NOT open the can or puncture holes in it.in any way 2. Get a large pot of water boiling. 3. Once water is boiling, take off milk labels and put cans into water (I do 4 at a time as it will keep on the shelf for a few months) 4. Turn temperature down to simmering & allow to cook for 2 to 3 hours (the longer you cook it the darker/thicker it will be) No one in my family has ever turned he cans. 5. after cooking for alloted time, turn off heat and remove pan from the stove to allow to cool, & then just walk away, do NOT attempt to drain the water or remove the can or open the can at all. 6. You MUST allow the cans & water to cool, before opening the can up. This will prevent the exploding can dilemma for some of the reviewers!  The milk can also be done on a campfire (which I have done at least a dozen times or more-allow it to cool in your cast iron dutch oven the same way you do in a pan on your stove top).  It is an amazing treat at camp (the boyscouts love it). This comes out thick enough to spread & we have been eating on sliced apples for as long as I can remember-delish.  Add a scoop to a pan with a little heavy cream & heat for an amazing caramel sauce...As far as the babysitting comments go...watching your food usually goes hand in hand with cooking :)",
