I also did not use the full amount, I added the milk slowly until the potatoes were the consistancy I was looking for. I also went lighter on the butter because I had used salted butter. Because I had an hour or so until dinner, I spread them in a baking dish and kept them in the warming drawer of my oven until dinner. They didn't break down and the flavor was awesome.",
