The third time I tried this I left off the cheese and just added the egg so that I could flip it and have a fully cooked egg.",

I buttered both sides of the bread then cut out the circle. Put the egg in the hole and salted and peppered some. Because I don't like my eggs runny I covered the pan with a lid to help cook the top of the egg some. After the bottom was browned I flipped the bread over placed the cheese on top and covered the pan again to help melt the cheese. It wasn't bad at all! The crispy fried bread really is what makes it taste better than just egg and toast.",
