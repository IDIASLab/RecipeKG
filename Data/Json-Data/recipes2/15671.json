It DID taste just like the melting pot, and after we'd finished dinner, I kept going back to the small amount of leftovers I'd saved so I could have another small bowl of this soup. I wish we had more because I could eat it all night. It's just so savory, especially with granny smith apple cubes. I used 1/2 cup of flour, 3/4 cup of buttermilk, 12 oz. bottle of Miller Lite, and 1/2 cup of parmesan and mozzarella cheese shredded mix. I omitted the celery and carrots, and just left the onions chopped. Wow, I'm really wanting some more right now. How did it go so quickly?! Everyone at the dinner table said it was awesome, and they all said it was their favorite thing that they had tonight. This soup is now one of my little secrets. :)",
