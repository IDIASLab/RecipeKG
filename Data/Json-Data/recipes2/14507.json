I made the following changes to make it taste like the real thing. Pour the coffee ( use Gevalia espresso) in a shallow dish add two teaspoons of rum and a little coffee liquor. Mix well. Now place the ladyfingers until they are soaked. Do not leave them for too long. Take them out when they are still a little crispy on one side. Place them on a clean dish untill the entire dish bottom is covered with the fingers. Now poor the rest of the mixture from the shallow pan a little by little. Reserve about two table spoon of this mixture. Now beat a package of cream cheese with 1 cup of heavy whipping cream two teaspoon of the reserves coffee mixture and half a cup of golden syrup. I did not use maple syrup because it has a strong flavor. Golden syrup is english and has a great flavor. Taste the mixture and if you like add more syrup to make it sweeter. Now pour the mixture ob top of the layered fingers spread evenly. Now soft the powdered cocoa on top. Place in the fridge for two hours. You will LOVE it.",
