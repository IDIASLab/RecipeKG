I used a large box of chocolate pudding instead of a small box of vanilla and chocolate (since I didn't have the small boxes). I also didn't use nearly the full amount of chocolate and peanuts for the topping - just enough for a light coating. Creamy just the right amount of sweet and delicious!",

First off I used a pre-made store brand 10 inch graham cracker crust but the pie was still near overflowing so no problems there. Second I'm very impatient when it comes to cooking so my mom taught me this trick where for every hour something needs to sit in the refrigerator you can put it in the freezer for ten minutes instead. It doesn't always work but thankfully it did for this recipe. Lastly in the filling I had to use some crunchy peanut butter along with creamy but it didn't change much. Also I replaced the chocolate shavings with mini chocolate chips and I didn't have any peanuts to use so I left those out. Overall no major changes and it turned out well just make sure your whipped topping is softened before spreading it on top or you'll mess up the layers. It tastes wonderful I love the taste of each layer.",
