These are too good! As with anything in the broiler, you need to watch it closely and make sure it's not too close. Marshmallows & chips burn easily so don't walk away..and don't knock down a recipe because you don't know how to broil things. (btw, I have to throw the rest out or I will eat them all) Thanks for the tasty snack!",

We enjoyed this fun little experiment of a recipe....they were hyped up on a sugar rush at bedtime......hahaha Thanks. Will be a movie time treat for them. Kudos.",
