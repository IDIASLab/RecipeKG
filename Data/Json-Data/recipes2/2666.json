I air pop the popcorn and then pour melted coconut oil with a little Himalayan salt over it and mix.  Sometimes just to change it up I  will add a little ground mustard, turmeric, and black pepper.  We love this.  You need to come up with your own amounts as everyone has differing tastebuds.  Give the basic recipe a try and then change it up every once in a while.  Hint- a little lime is good added to the basic recipe with Himalayan salt! Granulated garlic is good also. I like to add any seasonings to the melted coconut oil to help them distribute through the popped corn. Get creative!",

Over each batch I drizzle a small amount of additional coconut oil salt and then cover and shake it up to more evenly distribute. I just made some and with the salt I also added some dried minced garlic black pepper and nutritional yeast. Try whatever spices appeal to you but in small amounts because they can overpower.",
