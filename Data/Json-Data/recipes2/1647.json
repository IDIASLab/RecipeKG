Glad to have tried it!\" Unlike some sponsored recipes where I use different brands here or there I did have Hillshire smoked sausage (which I do like) and w/o it this recipe would've been really /yawn. I browned the sausage longer than 5-6 min (b4 adding the other veggies) b/c we like it brown and crispy. We definitely had to add more hot sauce when I served it along w/ salt too b/c it wasn't all that flavorful. I would've added at least 1 tsp. of Cajun seasoning while it was \"thickening\" (which incidentally it never did - it remained watery but at least the rice we poured it over absorbed all the liquid) had I thought that it wouldn't be great as-is.",

I put in a half a teaspoon. This was very yummy and I will definitely make it again! Husband loved it too! Also the sauce never thickened for me but it was over rice so it was fine!
