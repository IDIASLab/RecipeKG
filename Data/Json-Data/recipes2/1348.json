Last night's supper was the test run and I am well-pleased; it tasted just like I imagined. I did not have light soy sauce and so just used 1/2 cup of the regular stuff. I did not have rice cooking wine so I used the cheap sak\u00e9 I did happen to have on hand. I also lacked the Chinese rock sugar as well as the inclination to make it myself so I took Good EatNZ's suggestion to use an equivalent amount of brown sugar. The variation turned out just fine. This dish is extremely sweet so unless you plan to eat it in small amounts (such as in steamed buns) or over rice I would try using 75% or less of the sugar. In any case: delicious!",

All dark soy sauce used 2ozs of Brown sugar and water with a tablespoon of vingar (cider) He also used ordinary onions. AND - he has just confessed that he forgot to add the ginger!!! ANYWAY - it was great 1lb of meat was not a lot for our family of three although it was VERY rich and salty we had it over a plain fried rice and fried cabbage (neither of which we added salt to - as we could see how salty the pork would be) It was so tasty and the meat was REALLY tender!!",
