(Scale the recipe to 4 servings to do this....although one cheeseball should be way more than only 4 servings!). This is a really good cheeseball. Like another reviewer I added a squeeze of mustard (spicy brown). It was very easy to make too and I didnt' use the freezer at all but rather the fridge for a few minutes. Served with Trader Joe's pepper poppyseed water crackers and it was great! Great for New Year's and much better than the other recipe I was using! I love the sharp cheddar in this!",
