The only thing I did differently was to pre-cook the bacon in the oven and I sprinkled some pepper paprika and garlic powder on the sliced zucchini before baking it. I was looking for just a bit of spice. I didn't even need toothpicks actually- they stayed rolled up perfectly! And a word of advice - you can cut raw zucchini with a cheese slicer! It made slices of the prefect thickness! These were the first appetizers to go. FANTASTIC!",

                "reviewBody": "Good recipe but I prefer to make it with prosciutto instead of bacon. You avoid the possible flabbiness of bacon. Since you want to roll it up you need to leave the bacon pliable which means a little bit flabby. The cheese is smoked anyway so you don't necessarily need a smoked meat as well. I like a previous reviewer's idea of sneaking some rings of hot peppers into the roll. I will try this next time with thinly sliced jalapeno. This will add a little crunch too.",
