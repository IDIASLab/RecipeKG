The turkey took longer to reach the right temperature than expected, hence the honey glaze ended up burning the turkey even after being covered.  I basted several times, but there was no cider or honey flavor in the turkey or stuffing, just a little bit on the burnt skin.  Will try something that can infuse some flavor into the turkey next time, this one didn't.",
