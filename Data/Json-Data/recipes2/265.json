Added way more garlic, used juice from entire lemon, not just 1/4 cup, deglazed the pan with white wine, and made a basic white sauce with four, margarine, and nonfat milk instead of using sodium-laden canned cream of whatever soup.  We had fresh Swiss Chard in the garden, and used that instead of the spinach.  Served over brown rice.  Super yummy.",
