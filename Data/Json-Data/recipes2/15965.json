It was delicious although I think the thai restaurant put in more coconut milk but you can adjust it to your taste. Will definately make it again!",

Also every time I've had mushrooms in Thai dishes they have been straw mushrooms; and cilantro - not basil - seems to feature heavily. This was a nice enough meal but a little bit weird. Btw I would advise anyone who isn't used to cooking with things like green curry paste and/or fish sauce to add it a little bit at a time - both really are an acquired taste and you could easily spoil the meal by adding too much at once.
