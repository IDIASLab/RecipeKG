Next time I'll add some mustard to complete the cheesesteak flavor. This would also be good as a filling for a grilled cheese sandwich.",

I found McCormick makes a lower sodium beef gravy mix (use it if you can find it) and I switched to Velveeta (just cube it up and let it melt) instead of the Cheez Whiz because it's a bit less salty as well. With those 2 changes it made a difference in the saltiness (although it's still a bit too salty for our taste). We scoop it up with bread chunks so that helps cut the saltiness as well. Next time I may omit the gravy mix altogether and try a small amount of low sodium beef base to see if that does the trick! I'll keep trying because the dip is delicious! What an easy way to get your cheesesteak fix!",
