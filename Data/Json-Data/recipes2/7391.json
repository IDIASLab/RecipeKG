This was a great alternative to making a margarita with fresh lemons limes and oranges. It tastes the same if not better and is great when lemons limes and oranges are out of season or too expensive to use in a drink. It also doesn't have that stomach upsetting sour taste. My whole family loved it! I plan on using this recipe again and again!",
