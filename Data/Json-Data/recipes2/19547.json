There isn't near enough batter to cover 3 pounds of asparagus and as written the batter was way too runny to stick to the asparagus. I ended up adding a lot more flour and cornstarch and because I did that I had to add more seasoning. I grabbed the cayenne pepper and that was a nice addition. You might be able to do one pound of asparagus but I wouldn't count on anymore than that. Great idea but it needs tweaked to make it work.",
