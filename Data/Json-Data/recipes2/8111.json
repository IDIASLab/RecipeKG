It was delicious.\nI read the reviews and decided to add a 16oz. can of pineapple chunks with the juice. I didn\u2019t have prepared mustard but with all that liquid ground mustard stirred right in with the pineapple, honey and garlic. I must admit I also added some ground cloves and a bit of almond extract that I had seen on another recipe. I guess you could say I took it and made it my own. BUT I am very grateful for the basic recipe that allowed me to spend a carefree day with my family and serve a tender and juicy ham to rave reviews. Thank you, Kathy!",
