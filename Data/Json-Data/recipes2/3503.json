My wife lived in Cambodia for a few years and could take lots of ginger then but she was happy to tone it down too since she isn't used to so much any more. I found that I ate a lot more rice with it than I would with other fish dishes as the dish is quite potent. My wife said that is also typical of how Cambodians eat very small portions of (extremely flavourful) meat and a LOT of rice with it.",
