As suggested here I used real potatoes (red or yellow) heavy whipping cream instead of milk and 2 tbs flour. I never made clam chowder before and following other suggestions I used 1 green onion and added some carrots; mostly for the color and texture. Recipe deserves a 5 regardless the changes because those are my personal opinion:)",

If I make again I'd cube a big russet and cook 10 minutes longer leaving out the canned potatoes. If I don't have time ironically I'd just heat up a can of clam chowder. Thanks for the recipe.",
