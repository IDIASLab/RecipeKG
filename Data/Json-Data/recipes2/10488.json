I wanted to like this as I love avocado and everything else that went into this easy dessert, but after freezing I found it barely edible.  I left half to thaw out and added more of all the other ingredients and found it quite tasty, so I will probably make it again my own way, but it definitely needs more sweetness to it and more cinnamon.  I may even add ginger and play around with it.  Thanks for the idea.",
