The hamburgers were already in the skillet so I substituted a pouch of the Uncle Ben's Ready Rice Basmati and it turned out great too. This recipe is super fast and easy and perfect for those times you don't want to spend much time in the kitchen. And using the Ready Rice cuts back on mess and clean up too. The caramelized onions compliment the beef and gravy nicely and then the egg on top ties them all together perfectly. Thanks for the great recipe Mauigirl!",
