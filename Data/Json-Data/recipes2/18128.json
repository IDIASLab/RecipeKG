My pork chops were from Costco (that means they were THICK) so I marinated them for two days. I baked mine at 350 degrees for 40 minutes because of the cold weather here. I cannot wait to try them on the grill. Serve with something that will enhance the lemon flavor like asparagus or green beans. Great recipe.",
