It was a bit spicy for my taste so maybe next time I'll keep the pepper to the original amount. This was very easy and smelled divine while cooking. I added onions and green peppers to the chicken while cooking which my boyfriend agreed was a nice touch. The nuts were also a pleasant surprise but made the dish a bit heavy on the stomach. We had a good amount left over which was great. Worth the effort!",
