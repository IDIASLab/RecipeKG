I used only 1 can of tomatoes, doubled the garlic and wine (so I simmered it a little while longer - uncovered - to boil off some liquid. About 20 minutes all together). I also added basil and crushed red pepper while sauteing the onion and garlic... this added to the flavor a lot. Very easy to make and really delicious. I will definitely make it again.

At first I worried about what wine to use, but now I just dump in whatever I've got going and it turns out great every time.",

I think what I would do next time is not add the shrimp to the sauce but pan fry the shrimp in garlic butter with some lemon first, then add it on top of the pasta and sauce.  This way the shrimp would have more flavour.  Was a good basic recipe.  I would make it again but with my changes.",

After tossing it with the pasta I decided it needed more substance so I put in 1 cup of tomato sauce. I didn't put the whole cup of cheese on it because I am trying to watch my wasteline - I let everyone sprinkle their own desired amount of cheese on. I used a bag of frozen shrimp because I had them on hand - just thawed and pulled the tails off and threw them in the last few minutes to heat up. My husband LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!!!
