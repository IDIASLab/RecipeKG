Very impressive! I used chicken breast tenderloins to make it easier on myself (no cutting required) and I also used my deep fryer to make it easier on myself too. These were excellent as is but while eating them I had a thought. If you were to use peanut oil instead you might end up with a more Chick-fil-a taste. I'm not sure but it is just a thought.",
