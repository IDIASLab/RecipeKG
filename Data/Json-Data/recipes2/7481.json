It is alot thicker and richer than regular yogurt.",

Many canning jars have openings that are the same as the bottom of a blender pitcher. Portion your ingredients into single serve portions and freeze in pint sized jars (lids on but not \"canned\") In the morning just take the lid off a jar replace with the blender base/blades invert and put on the blender. Push the button and do your thing! This way if you don't need 4 servings you can make single servings and drink right out of the jar. We use canning jars as glasses all the time. Plus you can freeze different combinations of fruit for your smoothies to keep everyone supplied with their favorite tastes. Oh and I also add a little milk before blending just to smooth it up a little. If you don't have room for jars in your freezer go ahead and baggie up single serve portions as instructed in the recipe then blend in a canning jar. No cleaning the blender pitcher!",

Then I had to add some juice for some liquid. After I finally got it blended it needed something to sweeten it as the taste was so berry without sugar. I usually eat my berries plain so that didn't bother me so much. Will make the others with modifications I have 5 more bags.",
