The carrots and onions would be a distraction and, when I studied the recipe, I realized a little sweetener would be in order so I added \u00bc cup of local Maple Syrup. The best complement a beet hater (like me) could give this recipe would be I found it palatable. My wife, who I made this for, and is a beet lover, thought the recipe was outstanding!  As a beet hater, it would be unfair if I rate this recipe so, based on my wife's earthy tastes, I'll give this recipe the highest rating!",
