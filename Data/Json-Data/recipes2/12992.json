I kept cooking these but they never would get a deep brown on them. I think it would have helped if I made the patties thinner but you really couldn't if you wanted the zucchini to stay in. My conclusion is that all of the moisture in the zucchini is what kept them from getting that deep color that we like. If I were to attempt this again I'd grate the zucchini and let it sit in a colander for 20 minutes to drain.",
