I love chicken wings and so do millions of others but when entertaining at home, I don't like to make them because of the mess. The bones that we need to discard, the big pan to fry the wings in, and of course all of the sticky fingers! My Paleo boneless chicken recipe is not only healthy and easy to make but just pop in toothpicks and there won't be any sticky marks in your house. I hope you enjoy my version!",

I don't do paleo but thought this recipe looked interesting and wanted to give it a try. On that note I did not buy coconut amino but used reduced sodium soy sauce instead. These were different from the traditional hot wing flavor and have an Asian flair to them. I do think they need more Sriracha and ended up doubling the amount. These would be a big hit for a Superbowl party!",
