I used powdered ginger because I did not have fresh on hand. I also used a george foreman grill after marinating about an hour without the honey and then removed the fish added honey and boiled the marinade (as suggested by another commenter)while the fish was cooking and drizzled it on the fish before serving! A side note -- I accidentally spilled some pineapple juice on the dish at the table and it was still great! If I have it on hand next time I would think about adding about 2 table spoons of pineapple juice to the marinade (on purpose)!! ENJOY",
