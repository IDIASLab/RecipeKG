They are a super way to serve spaghetti and meatballs, and are formed by placing a swirl of spaghetti and one meatball onto a circular piece of pastry-style dough, and topping with another piece of slightly larger dough, and crimping the edges closed. Your kids will love these, and if you serve them at a tailgate party, expect them to be gone first!",

My complaints would be that 1 pound of pasta is waaaaay too much for the amount of pies you get out of this (only got 5 pies out of the package of 2 crusts). This was fun to try but For the amount I got out of it it's not really worth the effort to me. Thanks for sharing.:)",
