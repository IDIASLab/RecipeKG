I didn't know spinach could pair with rice so well. It has a rich flavor so don't expect a mild rice. Of course you or your family/guests should love spinach or it \"may\" disappoint. I personally cut the stems from the spinach and then chopped the pile of leaves horizontal then vertical on my cutting board to end up with about 1\" squares. When these stirred in and shriveled to the heat they integrated with the rice smoothly without any stringy bites. I ended up making it again the same week then a third time a couple weeks later! I followed the recipe exactly even doing it on the stovetop to start getting away from depending on my rice cooker. If this is followed step by step it does come out right so anyone can impress their friends with a fluffy flavorful rice. Any spinach lovers on the fence about trying a \"spinach rice\" should take the plunge on this one.",
