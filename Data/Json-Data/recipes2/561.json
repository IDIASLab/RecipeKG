I added caraway seeds (love them in sauerkraut and Dr. Oz says they help reduce bloating, in case you get that).  I  used Kraft's 1000 island dressing and it just doesn't have enough twang.  Next time I make this  I  will add sauteed onions and perhaps a few shakes of hot sauce.  I used 1/3 pound deli corned beef, about 1 cup of rinsed &  drained sauerkraut because I love the stuff (Libby's), and everything else was unchanged.  Will try this again and let you know how  it is with changes.",
