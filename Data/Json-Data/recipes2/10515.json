I used a mix of seasoned panko and regular seasoned breadcrumbs which gave these an incredibly crunchy coating that I loved. As far as the sauce goes...2 Tbsps. of garlic powder to 3 Tbsps. of sour cream is too much IMO so I used the garlic powder to taste. Sprinkle the 'fries' with some salt and you're good to go! A great healthy alternative that I will definitely be making again and again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",

My husband is loving them too so I'd better write fast.:) These are nice and crunchy outside and very creamy inside. I had everything in the house except for grated Parmesan but I did have some shredded. What I did was mix a handful of the shredded parm into the breadcrumbs. They came ot delicious. Will have these again Super Bowl Sunday for sure and probably before that! Thank you for the recipe.:) I think the dip is very good as well. I made it exactly as written but sprinkled with cayenne pepper to serve. Will make it again next time and also one of chunky red salsa and sour cream for different tastes. Really great snack!",
