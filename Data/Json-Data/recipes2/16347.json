This mellows the garlic a bit and gives the dressing a smoother consistency.  I also mix the honey, apple cider vinegar and garlic together first, then add the oil while whisking constantly (I think this is called maing an 'emulsion') - this keeps the oil from separating from the other ingredients when the dressing sits.",
