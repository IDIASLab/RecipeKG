The hot, crisp-skinned salmon tops a warm, soft, earthy mushroom and potato salad; both are surrounded by a cool, tangy tomato citronette (vinaigrette made with citrus instead of vinegar).

We did not like the contrast of cold tomatoes with the hot potatoes and fish. We also thought the potatoes and fish needed a little more sauce. I would give it 4 stars as written. The second time I tweaked things more to our preferences. I broiled the salmon as before. I doubled the tomato marinade and used it to saut\u00e9 the tomatoes. I then poured it over the potatoes mushrooms and salmon. 5 stars and company level taste!",
