For me, it would have been easier to coat the potato slices in oil in a bowl.  I thought about doing that, but didn't, and I ended up using way to much oil (didn't measure, just poured from bottle).  I used olive oil instead of regular oil.  Make sure you use large potato slices, or these won't work with the oven times.  I didn't think the smaller slices I had would be big enough, but I baked them anyway.  They made nice potato chips, at any rate.  I was distracted while making these and forgot to cut up any veggies, so I just topped with sauce, cheese, and a slice of pepperoni.  They are good, but messy, so I wouldn't serve anywhere that people are afraid to get dirty.  Bf said they were wierd.  I like the idea but I'm not sure that I'd make them again.",
