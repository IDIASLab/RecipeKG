The plus to the recipe is that the instructions are spot on and it was a quick and easy meal to get together. The downside was that the sauce was very sweet due to the quantity of applesauce added to the bbq sauce. I also was hoping that the sauce would become sticky on the chicken but it remained more of a sauce instead.",
