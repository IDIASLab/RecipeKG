Tasty and quick meal!  *Edit* I've now cooked this a few times, and I actually think I like it better on the stove, I saut\u00e9 the onions and mushrooms put them off to the side, then brown the seasoned pork chops, once they are almost done I add cream of mushroom and the saut\u00e9ed veggies, turns out great!
