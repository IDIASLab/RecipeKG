Looks like I found a keeper, and I hope you enjoy it too. There's no sugar, butter, or wheat, just sweet potato, banana, eggs, milk, oatmeal, and vanilla whey powder. It's great for anyone but especially bodybuilders who are adding mass or even cutting, depending on how you use this. Add a little maple syrup to your pancakes and say goodbye to unhealthy sweet-tooth cravings!",
