I must admit that we didn't follow the recipe exactly....we substituted pork for chicken because we had already planned on pork for supper when we came across this recipe. It worked great although chicken would be good as well. Two other things were modified. One the red pepper flakes were added with the broth and 1 teaspoon of corn starch was mixed in right before the pasta was added to thicken the broth a little. We happened to have fresh parsley on hand so used it as a garnish along with the feta. All of the flavored popped.",
