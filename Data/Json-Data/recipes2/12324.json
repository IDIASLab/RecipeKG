Two additions -- one teaspoon dry coffee added to the boiling water and about a 1/2 cup (+ or -) of Hersheys Chocolate Chips.  If you want to make this into a great poke cake, use a 13 x9 pan.  While cake is baking,  melt a bag of salted caramel chips from Hersheys and combine with a can of sweetened condensed milk.   After cake comes out of oven and cools slightly, poke holes with a wooden spoon in the cake and pour the  salted caramel topping over the top of the warm cake.",
