I used less honey 1/2 cup and made numerous substitutions but keep measurements the same and they came out delicious. To make a little healthier we substituted kashi for rice cereal and flipped the amounts for the chips. Overall a fabulous treat.",

I did make modifications to the mix-ins; I replaced the chips with unsweetened cacao nibs, added a little unsweetened coconut, and used 1 cup of oats in place of the granola and rice cereal.  So I had already planned for less sweetness.  I will make this again, just use a little less honey.",
