It was soupy after 5 hours on high in our 1980 Crock Pot and that was after melting in the Philly Cream Cheese Spread \u2013 maybe regular block cream cheese would have thickened it more.\n\nWe saved it by boiling up 12 Oz of fusilli 2 minutes short of al dente.  After draining the pasta, it was put back in the fusilli pot.  The contents of the Crock Pot was poured over the pasta.  Several minutes of stirring caused the starch on the pasta to thicken the soup and the pasta absorbed some of the liquid.  The end result was quite good.\n\nI suggest that next time a tablespoon of red wine vinegar or white vinegar at the end of cooking in the Crock Pot would add some zip to the recipe.  I think that a better name for the recipe would be Beef and Noodles rather than Stroganoff.",
