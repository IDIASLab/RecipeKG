If you have never worked with phyllo before, know that it is very fragile and must be kept covered or it will dry out very quickly. This is labor-intensive, but worth it. I like to divide the filling ahead of time into 48 equal little portions to ensure that all the borek are uniform in size. This may be made a day before they are baked, and stored covered in the refrigerator.",
