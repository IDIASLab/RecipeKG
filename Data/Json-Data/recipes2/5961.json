We used half a pretzel rod for each finger, and then used half of those to make toes.",

This is so easy to make and it's a great variation on the peanut butter candy (honey powdered milk and peanut butter) that my mom made us when I was a kid. Not only do these look great the pretzel in the middle of the peanut butter mixture adds a great crunch. I used 1/2 sugar Smuckers strawberry jam for the blood and thought that the color was perfect. Thanks for the recipe! Note: I find that these are served best right out of the freezer or refrigerator. When I make them I refrigerate so them right away so they keep their shape until serving time. They make a perfect Halloween treat or a great snack after a workout!",
