The only change I made was to chop up one whole red Thai chile pepper (with seeds) and add it at the same time as the lemon grass. It had the perfect amount of heat. The reason for only 3 stars is that it was so salty it was really inedible. There are only two possible sources of salt - the chicken stock and the fish sauce. I use the same low-salt chicken stock so it had to be the fish sauce. I would reduce it by half - although this may affect the \"sour\" part of the hot-and-sour. My other option is to try a different brand of fish sauce. I used \"Roland\" brand.",
