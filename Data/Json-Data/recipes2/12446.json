I used my instant pot to cook the meat and saute the vegetables, etc. instead of my dutch oven so I could make this in the morning to be ready for dinner.  Otherwise, I made the soup as written. The soup was okay but was lacking flavor. I did use mild Italian sausage as that was all I could find so a more flavorful sausage may be what this recipe needs.",
