A comfort food from LA and very welcome here by me! Rich yes- but don't skimp trying to make it less especially on the cheese- but you can use half and half if that salves your conscience a bit. And you can use the lighter butter there also the I Can't believe its not butter sticks give pretty decent results. Try this one out you will like the mac and cheese creaminess and the veg and the crawfish. And do add the mushrooms it's worth it- make sure you use fresh. To tighten up the dish a bit I put it in the broiler with a dusting of bread crumbs on top and that really sets it off! Thanks for posting this good recipe Janessa. Love the mudbugs!",
