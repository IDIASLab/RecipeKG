Ooh ooh YUMS. If you are looking for chicken that shouts \"Indian\" more than tandoori paste will do then it's best to look up and cook Indian chicken then sub it for the pieces in this recipe. Otherwise this recipe is just grand. Also I placed the naan on a baking tray that was coated liberally with olive oil. It adds calories and a thus a little more lip smacking decadence.",
