I followed the directions, no substitutions, the only issue I ran into was that I have a 6qt instant pot and the set serving size (8) seems to be for a larger instant pot size. I had to follow the last step by boiling my noodles and the beans in a separate dish and adding them afterwards as with all of the ingredients prior to that point brought it to the max level of the IP. I will adjust accordingly next time.",
