These are better than store-bought patties or restaurant patties any day of the week. They're not heavy and I couldn't stop eating them. I think I took them to work and ate them all myself. They'd be great in a pita or with wedge-cut wraps with yogurt. They should be moist and easy to eat, they shouldn't fight back (toughness) no matter how much you cook them. They taste out-of-sight and waiting to eat them or serve them is a killer. If you want them more 'burger like' I would suggest adding more bread crumbs.",

I don't have any experience with plantains but I knew they came either green or yellow so after googling the difference and learning the yellow are a bit more sweet and flavorful that's what I went with. I used extra firm tofu fresh mushrooms and folded in the bread crumbs with a spatula after processing. There wasn't enough moisture in the recipe to allow it to turn in the food processor so I added about 1/2 cup egg whites and that did the trick. I used vegetable spray rather than butter to cut calories. I cooked my patties a bit longer- maybe 8-10 minutes per side with the lid on the skillet to cook from both sides. They turned out a little crispy on the outside and still tender in the middle. This may be my favorite veggie patty recipe!!",

I also added some flaxseed meal (like I usually do with bread crumbs). Then I served it in a pita with plain greek yogurt and an orange sauce (1 cup OJ 1 Tb sugar and 1 Tb cornstarch). It was delicious. My meat-loving hubby liked it too. Not hard to make although a bit time-consuming to fry up the patties. I'll definitely make it again.",
