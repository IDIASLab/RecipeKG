This is by far the best dressing I've had in a while. Side note...I also added a teaspoon of onion powder only because I like the combo of garlic and onion.

I don't know if this was really a dressing for me at least not for salads. I think this would be a good dipping sauce for chicken fingers or maybe even homemade jo-jo's but on salad it was a little........different. Oh! I bet this would be great on maybe a chicken salad or even steak salad. Just a regular vegetable salad it just didn't seem like a good fit for me and my family thought I might be right. I'm going to make this again and try this on a meat salad and update my review.",
