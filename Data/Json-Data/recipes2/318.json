I opted to use half brown sugar and half white sugar and since most banana muffins have a little spice I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon along with a couple heaping teaspoons of vanilla. These came out very moist and tasted so good my husband had no idea there was avocado in it - until he noticed the light green color... What's great about these muffins are the avocado takes the place of butter or oil yet they still have all the moistness and flavor you'd expect. I topped these with a little turbinado sugar for some added crunch and popped them in the oven. They baked up beautifully in exactly 20 minutes. I never baked with avocado before but now I'm going to!",

I did make a few.  I did not have walnuts on hand so I substituted pecans.  May change that to 3/4 cup next time...we love nuts!  Because of some dietary needs at our house, I made them gluten free by using rice flour.  Went dairy free as well by substituting coconut milk. Left out the salt and added a teaspoon each of cinnamon and vanilla.  I hear my daughter now asking for another...I'm all smiles.",
