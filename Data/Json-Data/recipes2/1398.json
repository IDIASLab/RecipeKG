I made only 1/4 the recipe because there are just the two of us (along with a few tasters) and it filled a little 4x6 baking dish just perfectly! I followed the recipe except for maybe going just a tad heavy on the yummy Classico Alfredo sauce (maybe 1/3 of the jar---but totally not necessary). This is excellent and it will even be adaptable to another dish---I'm thinking eggs. Thanks so very much Baking Nana!",
