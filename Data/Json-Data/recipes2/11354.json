If I were to make this again I'd use all of the marinade on the chicken or either double it and use a full batch on the meat and a full batch on the veggies. The chicken was very flavorful and super tender. I do prefer more of a char on my fajitas and would grill next time. Overall a good recipe and one that could easily be changed up to suit your preference.",
