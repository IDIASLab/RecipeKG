I followed the recipe ingredients as stated but changed up the cooking method. We put the smoker to the test on these rib recipes for the first time. I smoked the ribs for 2 hours at 225 degrees removed and covered in foil after adding BBQ sauce cooked for 2-1/2 to 3 more hours removed from foil added more BBQ sauce and stuck back in smoker for about 1/2 hour. These were tender but not the fall-off-the-bone tender we like. While I'm sure the grill method is awesome we loved the smoker. We will use the 3-2-1 smoking method suggested to me by LilSnoo next time - heard it's perfect every time.",
