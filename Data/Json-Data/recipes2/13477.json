I also had trouble grounding the coriander seeds in the blender and did it without. I also had ground cumin and not the seeds. I had no sea salt so I used seasoned salt instead. I thought it was all right though my egg broke when I lifted it from the pan. I've had one cutlet and one egg which was so filing.",
