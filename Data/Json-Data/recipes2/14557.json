The cherries were pretty small so I was able to yield about 35 to 40 cherries out of the recipe. Also I didn't have any almond extract so I used vanilla. I made these on a Wednesday for Mother's Day that Sunday so they could sit for a few days and almost ate all of them. I will definately pass on this recipe. Warning I can't remember which brand of margarine I used the first time I made these but the dough comes out different depending on the brand of margarine. Land of Lakes comes out pretty sticky.",

Flower turns to a paste so the cherries center won't melt down as they should. As for the coating regular candy melts are the most sturdy. Tips on chocolate 1. rapidly chill it it stays shiny. It will look dull if hardened at room temerature (but DON'T over chill it it will crack!). 2. NEVER melt directly on the stove! use a double broiler or in 30 second increments in a microwave stirring in between segments (don't use glass bowls plastic only) 3. Avoid moisture water or condensation at all costs! It will make your chocolate thick and clumpy not good to use or look at! 4. Whitish or \"dusty\" looking chocolate is not spoiled! It simply melted and reset too slowly. Thanks for sharing a splendid recipe!",

I used butter and let it get real soft overnight and I used heavy cream instead of milk. When I melted the chocolate I only used one tablespoon shortening to make the consistancy perfect for dipping. (maybe a smig more) A little trick so not to have such a mess is use a teaspoon to scoop filling and drop onto wax paper. place in fridge for 10 minutes and then flatten and return to fridge for another 10 minutes. Now its easy to just wrap and slight mold the filling around the cherry. Return to tray and refridgerate for several hours before melting the chocolate for dipping. Fantastic recipe Auntylene THANKS AGAIN.",
