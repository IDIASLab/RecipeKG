To make it healthier I used 1 tbsp natural PB 1 1/2 tsp mini choc chips (I know that's quite a cut in amount but I'm watching my calories & the choc flavor still came through nicely!) & sprayed whole wheat bread with butter spray so thereby omitted the margarine. I baked the sandwich at 375 for 5 min then flipped it & baked for another 3-4 min. It was a great treat w/ some fiber & protein-plus a little chocolate for kicks! Thanks for sharing!",

We would make two pieces of toast (prefer whole-wheat) and when it was done immdediately press half (or a whole) Hershey's milk chocolate bar onto one piece of toast (the kind you would use for S'mores). On the other piece of toast spread peanut butter then immediately press the two pieces together. The heat of the toast will melt the chocolate and you don't have to mess with grilling it on the stove!",
