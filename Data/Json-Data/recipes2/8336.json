But because they couldn't see it, it wasn't an issue.  They just kept saying how delicious it was, and how much flavor it had!  I cut my chicken pieces smaller, more like tenders, which obviously meant I was going to need more breading, so I tripled the amount.  Definitely bake it on parchment so you can get all of that cheesy goodness off the pan!  The chicken was nice and juicy, and the cheese and panko got nice and crunchy.  The ranch underneath almost tasted like there was a sauce on it.  Will DEFINITELY be a goto meal, especially when I'm in a rush!",
