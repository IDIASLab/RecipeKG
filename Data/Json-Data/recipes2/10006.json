The roasted cauliflower with ham was nice. But there was too much excess cauliflower for the \u201ccream\u201d which was basically cheesy mashed cauliflower, even after using some of the liquid. There was way too much lemon flavor in the pesto. A similar recipe I saw called for the ZEST of one lemon instead of the JUICE. Would have been nice with just whole peas instead of pur\u00e9eing them into the pesto. The steps are also out of order.",
