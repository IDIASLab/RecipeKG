This is what I put together, and it has been a hit every single time I have made them! Not only are they delicious, but they are also very good for you. Win win! These pancakes are loaded with all-around nutrition and tasted delicious with pretty much any topping. After you are done, just add the topping of your choice. I like honey, agave, or the Maple Agave Syrup from Trader Joe's&reg;. Enjoy!",

I added chocolate protein powder because that is what I had, but it worked well. I also baked in the oven rather than on a griddle, at 400 degrees for 15 minutes each side on parchment paper and they turned out great! Will become a breakfast staple for us since they are easy to heat up for a quick breakfast all week. Thank you!",

I used to use box protein pancake mix from trader joes and top with Acai, berry mix by Dole,  i warm it in microwave and top the pancakes with it.  its like a warm berry topping, all natural sweetness.  i used to think i was eating the healthiest pancakes till i had these.  This added more protein with the nut and powder mix plus popping with awesome flavor.  Nice treat for after a good workout.  Thanks for sharing.  Just when you thought you were eating something healthy, this is much more healthy and fun to make.",
