My salmon pieces were 6oz each but the stated 1 1/4\" thickness and the cook time was perfect. I could probably get away with making half the amount of dressing for the arugula - personal preference. The use of arugula adds a nice peppery contrast to the sweetness of the salmon. A simple recipe yet it would make an impressive meal for company. I'll be making this often!",
