Long review: I used - a 6 oz can of tuna - 1 tbl of fat free nayonaise (soy based product) - 1 tbl of \"hot dog relish\" (mustard/relish mixed) - 1 tbl orange juice - a nut mix of soy nuts peanuts cashews and sesame seeds with garlic powder and other spices already on it. The flavor of the salad was overall \"brighter\" and different from normal tuna salad but not so different as to be odd. I thought the taste and texture were both great. The only thing I didn't like was that the nuts became somewhat soft after sitting in the tuna salad overnight. However it is possible that it has something to do with the type of nuts I used. Sometime I'll have to try it with pecans or walnuts and see how it turns out.",
