In addition to make it more fruity I added (believe it or not) fruit punch juicey packs (2) of them. That really gave it good \"tang\". I mixed all the ingredients an hour prior to serving (minus the sherbert). I let it get cold in the refrigerator. The reason I mixed it an hour prior is because I wanted the champagne to get soaked in by the strawberries. Awesome recipe and so flexible.",
