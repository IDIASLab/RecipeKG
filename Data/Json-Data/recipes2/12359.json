I sweated the veggies (put a lid on), I don't like crunchy veggies in queso. I do like the bite of a extra sharp cheddar but only used 4 oz. the other 4 oz. was pepper jack. A little thick but added more milk/cream, again preference. If not spicy for your individual taste don't cut off the membrane of the jalapeno or just some of it. I am from Texas and this is a definite keeper!",
