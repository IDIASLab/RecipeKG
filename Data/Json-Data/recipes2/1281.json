Also didn't have enough pistachios so used half pecans/half pistachios. Lastly I thought white chocolate would go with the cranberries better than chocolate so dipped in vanilla almond bark. The reason I'm not giving 5 is I'm not entirely keen on the texture the cornmeal lends to the cookie.",

I chose to swap out the dried apricots for a 4 oz. container of candied cherries for a more festive look. I only used about 1-1/4 cups of pistachios as well which was plenty. I find that when working with biscotti dough after placing the dough in two mounds on your parchment lined baking sheets sprinkling it with a bit of flour and working with well floured hands works best to form each rectangular loaf. We did dip half of some of them in the chocolate but also left some plain (my daughter's request) and did just a chocolate drizzle with others. My favorite are the ones with just a drizzle of chocolate. Thanks Reynolds for a great and versatile biscotti recipe!",
