Very tasty! Only thing I'd change in the future is if using Steak-Umms in the future drain the pan before adding the Steak-Umms meat. I'm sure that step isn't necessary if you follow the recipe as written though as it's the frozen water from the substitution I made that I'm speaking of:) This didn't taste particularly Asian even with the teriyaki sauce but it did taste good!
