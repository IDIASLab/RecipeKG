(Drain excess oil)\n\nReturn meat to pan, add one can of tomato sauce. You can caramelize 1 onion in another pan and add to meat. Simmer on medium/low until tender. Add water if needed as it simmers to keep it from drying up.\nLast 5 minutes, add 2 cans of green beans. (drained)\n\nRice -\nBoil rice, up to 5 minutes. (do not cook rice all the way. Semi crunchy still)\nRemove and rinse.\n\nAdd 4 tbl oil and 2 tbl of butter in a pot large enough for rice and meat until butter melts..(med/high)\n\nAdd 1/3 of rice. 1/3 of sauce, ever so lightly combine, rolling it. Repeat 2 more times.\n\nCook on med/high for 7-10min uncovered. Cover with lid (wrap lid with kitchen towel or few sheets of paper towels.\n\nCook for additional 40 min. ( this will crisp the bottom of the rice. (Ta dihg)\n\nGet a large enough plate, place on top of pan and flip it.

If your cooker is non-stick like mine the 'rice cake' will pop out in perfect shape when you're ready for dinner! An excellent one-pot meal!",

I also used Morningstar Farms burger crumbles and brown basmati rice and used 2 cups of broth and because of the longer rice cooking stage:40 skipped the first cooking of the beans by just tossing the rice in with the beans. This nicely filled and nicely stuck to my Calphalon everyday pan but the crust was easy to scrape out and put on top of the rice and tasted just as good. The crust was declared a delicacy!
