I have to disagree with the other review saying too seasoned and say that with just a dash of season salt it was on the mild side for me (and I didn t rinse the broth off!). I was just looking for a recipe that has a bunch of the ingredients I need to get rid of but I m going to save this as a template for other miscellaneous veggies.:) The only improvement to the recipe I would make: please change the ingredients from saying large chunks to saying shredded. I had already chopped them by the time I got to the part that calls for a food processor so I finely diced them best I could when I could have used a grater. (Still good obviously and not a big deal. But mildly exasperated for a minute)",
