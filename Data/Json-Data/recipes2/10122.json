Instead of making individual lettuce cups I used the same lettuce as a base for a built salad. I added the rice mixture on top of the lettuce and then instead of mixing canned flaked tuna in I grilled ahi tuna steaks sliced them and added them on top of the salad. This is a clever mix of textures and flavors. Nice job Uncle Ben's!!",
