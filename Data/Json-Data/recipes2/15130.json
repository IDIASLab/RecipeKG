They are super rich but not too sweet; much more like fudge than like the traditional Nilla-wafer-based rum ball cookies. After reading LARABER's review I decided to forgo the jimmies and used General Foods International Suisse Mocha flavored coffee powder to roll them in instead which worked really well. I think the sugar in it helps compensate for the bitterness of the chocolate. I also had the same experience where the mixture was much too runny to make into balls. I added about half a cup more powdered sugar (maybe even more) which seemed to help. Also it wasn't cold enough after an hour in the fridge but three hours was plenty. Finally I used amaretto for half the batch and rum for the other half. Both tasted awesome.:-)",
