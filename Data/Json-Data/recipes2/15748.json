I think I will marinate them more than 2 hrs like I did...in fact I'll probably let them soak overnight for maximum flavor. Also next time I wont use oil to pan fry them.... there is pleanty of oil in the itailan dressing to make it cook well. Thanks Chris for posting this recipe...it's a definate keeper!!!",

Didn't have lime juice so I substituted lemon juice.  Marinated chicken tenders for a couple hours in a ziplock bag.  Added a sprinkle of salt while cooking.  Started out with a few tenders on my George Foreman grill but that was a mess to try to clean up so I sauteed the rest in a non-stick skillet, covered much of the time and near the end I added some marinade to the skillet and let it caramalize....that added a beautiful color and flavor to them!!!!  My kids and husband loved them.  Would also make a great sandwich.  Thanks for the recipe!!",
