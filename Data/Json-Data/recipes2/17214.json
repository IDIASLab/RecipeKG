                "reviewBody": "This is a good recipe but it would be blend if followed exactly. So here are the changes I made: (1) Use cooking spray. Butter would be too heavy and the leftover is greasy. (2) Marinated whole chicken breasts with 3tbsp each of soy sauce lime juice and tequila for overnight. To make the paste (made a day ahead): (3) Doubled the amount of the ingredients for the paste (I actually shopped 2 jalapeno peppers myself!). (4) Also added 2/3 cup finely chopped cilantro. Saut\u00e9 the garlic jalapeno and cilantro together then added the chicken stock tequila and lime juice (doubled the volume of the liquids too) and simmer to a paste (took 40min). (5) Drained marinate and brown the whole chicken breasts. Removed the chicken breasts from pan let cool slightly then tear to strips about the width of 2-fingers. This gave a much better texture than cubed. (6) Because I didn t think the flavor would be enough with just the paste so in a small saucepan I reduced 1 cup of chicken stock with 1/2 cup of tequila 3 tbsp of lime juice 1tbsp of soy sauce to 1/2 the volume. I think in the future I would use more tequila stock and lime for the paste and eliminate this step. (7) Saut\u00e9ed the pepper slices for 1 minute and remove from pan (don t over cook). (8) Saut\u00e9ed the onion slices then mix in the chicken strips. Sprinkled a pinch of flour (to absorb grease). Mix well. (9) Mixed 1tsp of arrowroot starch (or any thickener) with 3/4 1cup of half-&-half then added to the chicken/onion mi",

Unless you love heavy cream I would recommend using about 2/3 the recipe amounts. For tequila lovers use up to two times the recipe amounts for stock and tequila. It is also much quicker to put the chicken in one skillet and the veggies in another so you can cook them at the same time. A pinch of cayenne also makes a great addition.",

It's sooooo tasty!  To make things more interesting, I doubled the amount of tequila!  Other than that, I followed the recipe as instructed and it turned out absolutely great.  As a side-dish, I cooked the Mexican sour cream rice and it's a great combination...along with savory deviled eggs!  An absolute winner of a combination and dish!  Kudos to Brenda, the author of this great chicken recipe!",
