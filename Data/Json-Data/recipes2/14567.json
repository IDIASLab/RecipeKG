I grated the Monterey Jack because I felt it would melt easier when baking.  I used just one can of artichokes which I thought was plenty.  Make sure you cut up the artichokes before adding them into the cheese mixture.  I mixed the cheddar cheese and green onions directly into the mixture instead of sprinkling on top and added a bit of seasoning salt.  I mixed the bread in last and then stored the bread mixture in a bowl in my fridge.  When I was ready to bake it later that night I let  the cheese/bread mixture sit out to soften a bit before I spread it into the hollowed out bread.  Definitely cook it at 350 for about 30 minutes for a great result.  After cooling for a couple of minutes, I sliced it into chunks for appetizers.  It's very rich but very tasty.  Just one note about a previous reviewer saying something about this being \"bad artichoke dip\".  I've made artichoke dip tons of times and this obviously intended to be a different type of recipe.",

I made a few cooking adjustments and it really turned out great.  Everyone enjoyed it!  Here is what I did:\n1.  Be sure to use a long \"larger diameter\" loaf of bread, like the artisan kind.  I don't think this will work without a hefy loaf of bread.\n2. You only need to use about 2/3 of the required \"stuffing ingredients\" (i.e. Monterey Jack cheese on down).  That will be plenty to fill your loaf.  I made the full recipe and had lots left over that I couldn't use for this.\n3. As others mentioned \"broiling for 10 min.\" would never work.  I baked (without adding the cheddar cheese and green onions) for 20 - 25 min. in a 350% oven.  I then added the cheddar cheese and green onions and broiled for 5 min. until bubbly.\n4.  To serve:  I sliced each loaf half down the long way and then came back and sliced each quarter length into 1 1/2 inches easy to eat portions.\nEveryone loved it!",

I cut the bread in half and hollowed out and stuffed both sides (even though the recipe does not indicated to do so) and I still had way too much filling. This results in a finished product that looks great but once you try slicing it as the recipe states it is nearly impossible to get nice even serving pieces. While I like all the ingredients listed I thought the end flavor was a bit too rich even in very small doses. If I were to make this again I would definitely cut the filling ingredients in half.
