I found this recipe and have to agree with the one other reviewer this is not good! To make it a little healthy I subbed some of the concentrate for 1/2 frozen orange. Orange concentrate is loaded with sugar and my orange was a lot sweeter than the tart concentrate. I find whey protein to be very sweet and has a strong flavor so I just used 1 Tblsp. I would have never been able to drink it with the full scoop. I tasted it and it just tasted like the tart concentrate mixed with a heavy amount of vanilla whey protein powder! I am giving it more than one star because I was able to revive it with 1 large frozen banana and a packet of Truvia. Plus I can't imagine adding fish oil to a smoothie! I really wanted to like this after reading the name.:(",
