I pre-baked the tofu to give it a meatier texture. I used canned pineapple tidbits for the pineapple juice then threw the tidbits into the pan at the end of cooking. Next time I will saute onions and peppers to add to it. It was a winner with all family members!",

I thought it was a little too sweet and needed something to balance it out, so I added a tablespoon of sriracha hot chili sauce.  My family loved it and gobbled the whole bowl up.",

We followed some of the other reviewers suggestions like marinating the tofu in soy sauce, adding onions and pineapple tidbits. We also added whole cooked carrots and asparagus to the mix. It was sooooo good. I was worried it would be too sweet also, but I feel the mustard and soy sauce balanced it out. This one is a keeper!",

The glaze tasted a bit too much of mustard when I made it so ended up about doubling the soy and adding a tsp of Worcestershire sauce and a bit more syrup.

Definitely worth a try if you like tofu.",
