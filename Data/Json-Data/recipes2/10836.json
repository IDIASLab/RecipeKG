The recipe tells you to beat with an electric mixer until well blended which I did not until you reach a certain consistency. Layering this dessert was impossible because the Maria cookies floated to the top. It would seem to me that the milk mixture would need to be thicker for this to work. The cookies taste good and that's the only reason I'm giving this a 2-star rating but the milk mixture all puddled at the bottom of the dish just runny. Sorry for the bad review but I don t see how I could have made a mistake in preparing this dessert simply because of the simplicity of the recipe but this was a failure for me.",

After all some are juicier than others and the amount is critical...Less than that and the milk mixture won\u2019t thicken right. I drizzled it in as I whisked. An 8x8 pan is perfect for 3x3 cookies or 9 per layer. I put a little cream down first and had enough to layer about 1 and a third packages of the cookies or 5-6 layers. I like it after a few hours when the cookies still have a little texture...and I liked it overnight when it had soaked into the cookies and had a more cake like look and texture.",
