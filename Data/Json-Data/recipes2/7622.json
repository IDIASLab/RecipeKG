What I mean by street food is that you can get it almost anywhere in Sichuan--even a small food stand on the side of the street. It is actually simple to make, and the ingredients are easy to find. It is definitely a quick, easy meal, though you might want to watch out for the garlic. This noodle dish is better served right away. It does not taste as good if you leave it overnight and take it for lunch.",
