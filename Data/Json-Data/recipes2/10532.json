I used dried basil, and I thought it overpowered the more subtle flavors of avocado and feta cheese. Those two flavors do very well on their own with this dish, in my opinion. Also, the basil flavoring does not complement the other flavors as well. I liked the flavoring added by the tomatoes. I used fresh rather than canned, and recommend fresh tomatoes chopped.\n\nOtherwise, it's a good recipe.",
