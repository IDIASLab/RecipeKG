Used fat free cottage cheese and ommited the sour cream. Added a few pats of butter and folded in a sauteed chopped onion for rich flavor. Topped the mixture with Mexican cheese blend salt and pepper. Baked in a 9 x 12 dish. I was terrified of failure when I scooped them out and they were runny (!) however they did set up nicely after sitting for a bit while my meatloaf rested. I suggest draining the cottage cheese. A good recipe when you want something tasty that will not be covered in gravy but I am still searching for my all-time favorite potato recipe.",

Definitely salt and pepper the potatoes before adding the other ingredients. I used full-fat cottage cheese and then low fat cheddar and sour cream and it came out great. To avoid runniness: take the cottage cheese and the sour cream and blend in the blender till smooth. Line a colander with cheesecloth and put in a bowl. Turn the cheese mixture in and let it drain for a couple of hours before continuing on with the recipe. I also threw in some cheddar with the cottage cheese and sour cream. Comes out really great that way. Thank you Stephanie!",
