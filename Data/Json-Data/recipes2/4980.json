The \u201clegs\u201d are usually more overcooked than I prefer, sO I trim them off, & freeze for later.  I usually fix them using Chef John\u2019s circle method, however, when I saw this recipe, & realized how the sauce would taste, I figured it would be another way to utilize them!  So, I made my salmon, in the sauce and really enjoyed it!  However, I\u2019m not a fan of green beans, or rice!  Soooo\u2026 I got some of *the* most exquisite tiny asparagus from Wegman\u2019s market, and used them!!  I made couscous, and by increasing the sauce, I could use it as a base liquid for my couscous.  Well, the whole meal turned out fabulous!!!  So fabulous, I\u2019m going to do it again next week!!!",
