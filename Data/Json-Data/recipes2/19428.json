To really make the light frozen whipped topping even more decadent (and to make it stretch a little further) wisk together a 3 oz. package of sugar free INSTANT pudding mix and a cup of fat free milk then fold the whipped topping into the pudding. To fancy them up a little it's great to dip the sides in sprinkles or chopped nuts.",

You can spike it up as much as you want. Absolutely delicious thank you for posting!",

We sometimes spread just a little Nutella on plain graham crackers before putting them together and have even used that great Milky Way spread from a jar. Both are nice and thick easy to spread LIGHTLY. Plain grahams & original flavor whipped topping however a great way to go to keep things simple and keep us on track with the diets.

I used the chocolate raspberry Newton cookies (which are flat and crispy) instead of crackers. And I used fat free cool whip. It was great I mean its not ice cream (but thats the point). This is so simple and quick to do and it freezes fast. Will definitely try different cookie combinations or mixing peanut butter or mint into the cool whip!",
