We used ground turkey, two packs of Ramen (only 1 packet of seasoning), the corn and tomatoes specified, and a few frozen green peas thrown in with the noodles for some color. We also sprinkled cheese on top before serving. The only dishes to clean: our eating bowls and utensils, the one pot and spoon used during prep, and ourselves! Thanks for the recipe--this will trump ordering pizza or Chinese takeout next time we're wanting a break from my normal whole grains/low sodium/high veggie meals :). ",

I was looking for something easy to toss together after a late day at work, and this more than fit the bill! \n\nThe only real change I made was using a can of (Rotel brand) tomatoes with green chilies. It gave it just a little extra kick. I used 2 packages of noodles (with an extra 3/4c water to compensate) and about a packet and a half of seasoning - perfect!\n\nI think the key to getting the noodles to cook properly is remembering to COVER when you simmer. The steam gives them a delicious, chewy, al dente texture.\n\nThe only reason I didn't rate this one 5 Stars was the lack of visual appeal. It's not pretty, but don't be fooled - IT'S DELICIOUS!

I used two pkgs of noodles and ended up cooking another bag afterwards to add to the pan.  \n\nThe second time, I made it with the oriental flavored noodles, and I did not season the ground beef while cooking.  I used three pkgs oriental noodles crushed.  My husband said it was better.  Therefore, next time, I will not season the ground beef while cooking, and I will use 3 pkgs noodles.  I will use 2 cans diced tomatoes, and 1 can corn. This will be a commonly found dish at my home.",

I added some garlic and onions to the beef as well as some salt and pepper, used 2 packs of Oriental Mr. Noodles with their seasoning packets, and added a bit of chicken broth as the mixture looked too dry to cook the noodles.  Oh and I also threw in a pinch or two of sugar.  I think I might cook the noodles separately next time and then throw them in once they are softened...might be easier and quicker.  I'd give this 5 stars if only it looked prettier.  Tasted great and husband enjoyed several servings of it!",
