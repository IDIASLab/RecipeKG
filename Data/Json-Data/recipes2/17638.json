I used fresh cod and boiled it in heavily salted water and added some salt to the parsley/olive oil mixture. I also used red potatoes since that's what I had on hand. I followed the rest of the recipe as-is. The flavors were absolutely outstanding. I love that it's so healthy too. I never go back for seconds on dinner but I did with this one. My husband said he could survive on this dish alone. It's honestly so good I almost felt guilty taking credit for it! Thanks for contributing this one.",

Therefore I use (heavily salted) fresh cod instead of dried bacalau. Also I sliced the potatoes prior to boiling them. The way I see it slicing raw potatoes is easier than slicing potatoes that are mostly cooked. My father-in-law is from the Azores Islands and he LOVES this dish! Looks like I ll be making this dish often instead of the in-laws ordering it from the European catering place down the street. This is a keeper!!:-)",
