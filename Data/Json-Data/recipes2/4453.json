My 11 month old couldn't get enough of these delicious \"pancakes.\" I was in a hurry so I didn't measure exactly...a little more zucchini, a little less cheese, no onion so I just threw in some garlic powder. I used 1 serving of \"Biscuit Baking Mix\" recipe from this site instead of 1 cup of Bisquick, subbing olive oil for the shortening. Next time I'll probably use sharper cheese, more garlic, or actually use the onion. Thanks, Tricia!",

I've also spiced it up too...To mix the egg, I put the 2 in the blender with the onion, 2 garlic cloves and a tablespoon or so of hot portugal peppers, blended, then added to the mix. Also added salt & pepper.  Will definitely add more hot pepper next time, but it was great. Served them with sour cream mixed with garlic, salt & pepper.  Great side dip. Will definitely make these again.",

I used the \"Homemade Biscuit Mix\" from this site and scaled it down to 5 servings to fit this recipe. Shredding the zucchini in the food processor made quick work of it. I found that on medium heat my pancakes were very brown on the outside but not quite cooked on the inside so I turned down the heat and cooked them longer. I might spread them out more next time to make them thinner and cook on medium heat. They were very tasty with quite a delicate flavour however next time I'm going to add salt pepper and a few spices and see how they turn out. Thanks Tricia for a new way to use up my garden zucchini.",

My 14-month old loved them and I even turned them into a sandwich with lunch meat mesquite chicken and kraft singles in between two of the pancakes.
