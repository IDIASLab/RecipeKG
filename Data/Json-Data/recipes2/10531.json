I made it in the morning and let sit in the fridge all day minus the avocado which I added right before serving. I thought it needed an extra squirt of lime prior to serving because the lime flavour really mellowed through the day. I served this as a side to fish tacos but it is worthy of accompanying any main. Thank you Mom2Bell&Bubba. This is a keeper!",
