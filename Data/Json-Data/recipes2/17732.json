Very easy (always a plus!) and went over quite well. I served it as a \"summer supper\" with corn on the cob fresh tomatoes and some meatballs. I even added some mushrooms to the recipe at the last minute because they were about to go bad. I'm excited about this one because I feel like it can work with a lot of different ingredients (yet another plus - woot woot!) so that makes me happy. Very happy actually. Now.

We had some Olive Garden dressing and used that. I did add a little salt and pepper at the table. Nice and tasty!",
