(We brushed a non stick pan lightly with oil set on medium heat added about 8 potstickers at a time and let them sit for 2 minutes without touching then added 1/4 cup of chicken broth covered and turned down on low and let steam for another 2 minutes. Afterwards we removed them and placed them on a sheet pan in the oven set at 200 degrees to keep them warm while we did the same with the rest. In between batches make sure to clean off your pan with a paper towel). We dipped them in gyoza sauce and hot chili oil. They turned out beautiful and loaded with flavor!!! Thanks for the recipe!",

The only issue I had was with the lemongrass - and I didn't see anyone else mention it so it might be me. I had a hard time getting the lemongrass minced in my food processor. I pulsed it for a while then cranked it then sat around hoping the lemongrass would soften then cranked it again. It turned out fine but there are still a few rather intimidating chunks it there so next time I would bash up the lemongrass and ginger together in the processor with just the soy and then add the other ingredients once it was fine. Sorry this is so long - thanks so much for the recipe!",

We sauteed them in a tbsp of veg oil for 2 minutes added 2 tbsp of water covered and let steam for 4 minutes. Dipped in sweet chili sauce and YUMMMMMY! Made these for guests 2 nights in a row and RAVE reviews! Looks difficult but VERY easy and delicious! update used ground pork last night and that was just as yummy!!!",
