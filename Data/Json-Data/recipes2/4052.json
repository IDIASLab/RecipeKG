The  chops also need salt and pepper.  The cook time is a little excessive, especially for loin chops that are so lean and tend to dry out when overcooked. It's also much easier and quicker to just put the cast iron skillet into the oven instead of dirtying another dish. I did like the mushroom soup/diced tomato combo though - you couldn't tell that canned soup was used, and that's a good thing!",

My tweaks are as follows:\nSear the boneless chops in a deep frying pan and set aside.  Saute some fresh mushrooms and add the soup, about 1/2 c. of beer and some worcestershire sauce and tomatoes;  mix together. Put the chops back into sauce, top with the onions; cover and simmer for 20-25 minutes. I agree with one reviewer who wrote that the cooking time is too much.\nThank you, Bobby, for the ingredients you suggested, as I think this makes one of our favorite quick meals a lot tastier!",
