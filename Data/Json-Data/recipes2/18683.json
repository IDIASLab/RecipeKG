I added mushrooms to the recipe and sauteed them in olive oil, garlic and wine and then added the spinach and artichokes. I used marinated artichokes and added the liquid from the jar to the mix. Then add the cooked chicken and 1/2 to 3/4 of a package of dry italian dressing mix. This is key! Simmer for a few minutes before adding it to the orzo, pancetta and pinenuts. You don't need to necessarily add the balsamic vinegar at the end because there is tons of flavor but it is personal preference. Serve with grated parmesan cheese and YUM you've got a winner!",

I used marinated artichoke hearts instead of plain and rough chopped them to make the pieces smaller. I used chicken broth in place of the wine and it was still tasty. My husband is eating a second helping right now. I will definitely make this again using the changes I made. Thanks for a great base recipe.",

Definetly would have been too much orzo so I only used half a box. Instead of panchetta I used bacon (I couldn't find any at the store)..which I saved and crumbled on top at the end. I didn't use the pinenuts. I used marinated artichokes (including all the juice in the jar) and added chopped up sundried tomatoes (but you can use fresh too). I added italian seasoning (Mrs. Dash Tomato/Garlic Blend regular italian seasoning minced garlic dried basil and a whole packet of dry italian dressing mix) when sauteeing the chicken and veggies. The flavor combo was amazing. It was even better cold the next day. I will definetly be making this again:) Thanks.",

Followed many other reviewers suggestions: Used Marinated Artichoke Hearts Added sundried tomatoes black olives and ready to eat edamame Left out onions because none of us like them. Used turkey bacon instead of panchetta dbled recipe for dinner party but still used only 1 bag of pasta. was perfect amt we served w/ rosemary rolls and ceasar salad. Balsamic was a little strong since there weren't any other seasonings used - was going to add packet of dry italian dressing but forgot - will definitely use it next time - wish there was a little more of a sauce - maybe add some corn starch to the liquid at the bottom to thicken it up? But loved the combo of ingredients and leftovers still tasted great - will make again - great for dinner parties with everyone bringing a side or appetizer since is a full meal in 1 pot. ammendment - Made this a 2nd time but halved it - added the italian seasoning packet and used balsamic dressing instead of vinegar - also used some corn starch to thicken sauce. I liked it much better w/ the dry italian and thickening up the sauce - will stick w/ balsamic vinegar cause I like the strong flavor - left out chicken for vegetarians and didn't miss it - great veggie meal w/ lots of flavor!",
