I also preferred to put in real fresh minced onion. I also minced green onions (a stalk) & just threw in about 1 tablespoon ( but you can add more or less for your own particular taste) and threw that in the mix for more flavor as well. I followed the rest of the recipe & I just stirred everything in real good & it tastes great. This is a great creamy fluffy thick vegetable dip that isn't as loaded in salt & additives like the store instant dressing packets contain. It's also very simple to make as well! I love it!
