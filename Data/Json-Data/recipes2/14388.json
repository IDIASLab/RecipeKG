I mixed it in with the cream cheese (as opposed to drizzling over) and started with 2oz of horseradish, I also added minced sweet red peppers for texture and color.  I made it the night before to let all the flavors come together and served with tortilla chips, all of my guests raved about this and it was gone in a hour.  I think next time I will add a tbsp of strawberry preserves for a different flavor.  Enjoy!",
