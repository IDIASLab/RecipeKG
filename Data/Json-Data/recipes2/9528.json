Could never be quite as good as Felix's in New Orleans, but for being stuck at home during a pandemic, my oh my,  this made for a couple incredibly delicious  winter evenings!  Our oysters were ginormous, so we had these over 2 nights, leaving the oysters in the oven a few more minutes the 2nd night to make them somewhat easier to shuck.  The flavors in the butter mixture seemed to meld a bit more by the 2nd night as well, so we will make that ahead of time the next time we make these, and the next time after that.  This recipe is definitely a keeper - wouldn't change a thing!",
