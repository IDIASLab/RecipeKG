You can make simple syrup by heating equal parts sugar and water in a saucepan until the sugar dissolves. Simple syrup and bitters can also be purchased rather inexpensively at the liquor store. I used Meyers dark rum and grated about a half teaspoon of fresh nutmeg over the top of the whole batch and stirred it in. The punch has a really wonderful flavor and a bit of a delayed effect so watch out! Thanks for sharing, I will be making this again. ",
