First it needs more than a 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I ended up using a whole can. When you put in the meat like others have said add some garlic and ginger. We also added some chopped fresh cilantro which helped boost the flavor by A LOT. Delicious if you love cilantro like us. Once it was done it tasted like it was missing something and a good squeeze of lime juice really helped. I think next time we might try a little coconut milk too in order to give it a real Thai flavor!",
