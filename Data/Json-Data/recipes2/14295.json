We had about 40 guests (and 8-10 of those not drinking alcohol or only drinking beer or mixed drinks) and we ended up starting out with a double batch making a quadruple batch and then another quadruple batch. Granted we did end up with leftovers... the last batch was extra strong and at the end of the evening but I'd say we would have been perfect with 8 batches for 30 people on a summer night. Heeding other reviewers' suggestions we thought the recipe would not be strong enough so we added coconut rum (same quantity as the regular rum). Definitely will make this again.",
