Milk and egg should be at room temperature. To speed this process put milk in a glass and place the glass in a bowl of warm water for 10 minutes. Whole egg can go in the bowl too. 2. Sift the flour 3. Add to the flour/baking soda mixture: 1/8 TSP kosher salt 1/2 TSP sugar; reduce cinnamon to 1/8 TSP 4. Place empty muffin pan in preheated oven for 2 minutes. Remove pan from oven and place a bit of butter in each cup. Add batter and return to oven. 5. Per another reviewer after baking cover popovers with a towel during 5 minute cooling time (great suggestion - kept them really moist!) 6. Pour melted butter into a large bowl and drop popovers in. Shake bowl to cover well. 7. Reduce coating to 1/2 TBL cinnamon 3 TBL sugar. Good flavor balance this was more than enough to cover them.",

Unfortunately my oven is hotter on one side than the other so they were a little bit lopsided but they tasted great. One thing I will do next time is while they are cooling in the pan for 5 minutes I will cover with a kitchen towel like with tortillas to prevent too much of a crust from forming as there is quite a contrast from the coating to the crust to the middle. A perfect breakfast for 2!",
