I used shredded cheddar cheese and definitely added the optional chopped tomato and dill pickle slices.

My aim was to copycat that pizza using this recipe as a guide. I had some turkey bacon to use up so I diced it up and fried it using the drippings to sautee half a diced yellow onion. To the hamburger I added a couple dashes of worchestershire sauce as well garlic/onion powders to taste and a little seasoning salt. I then mixed the bacon and onion right into the hamburger. I made the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust from this site too which was wonderful. Instead of the Thousand Island dressing I used a mix of ketchup and mustard and added a little mayo for good measure. Valentino's bakes the pickles right into their pizza and so did I. I diced up a couple sandwich-sliced Claussens and added it directly to the ketchup-mustard mixture. I also added a thin layer of lettuce over the sauce and finally added the hamburger/bacon/onion mix. Covered with a mix of shredded cheddar mozzarella and an Italian blend and baked for about 10 minutes at 450. Husband devoured half the pizza by himself! This will be a repeat....I'd like to try again using the Thousand Island dressing now.",
