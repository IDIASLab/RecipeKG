I used 4 small cans of low salt chicken broth(less than stated) and 28oz can Contadina crushed tomatoes in puree. Since I didn't use full amount of broth I figured I better cut back on seasoning so I used only half of each. I didn't have zucchini so I added a bag of frozen green beans with carrots. You could probaly use peas too. As it cooked I wanted it a little thicker so I added one more tablespoon flour mixed with a little water. This may be a little spicey for young ones but my family loved it. Serve with bisquits and it's a great meal! Thanks Tim we really enjoyed this!",

In no time flat and with very little effort I had a wholesome delicious meal on the table. This is a great starter recipe one that allows for great latitude with your own tastes and ingredients in mind. I removed the casings from three Italian sausage links browned it then drained and rinsed it to remove the excess grease. I returned the sausage to the pan along with chopped onion green pepper and garlic and cooked that in olive oil until the vegetables were almost tender. I didn't measure exactly but added some of my own marinara sauce from my garden the chicken broth an Italian seasoning blend to taste and a healthy splash of red wine. I did not use the flour. I let that simmer for about half and hour and the aroma was wonderful! Added the zucchini and acini di pepe as directed in the recipe and at the last added a can of cannellini beans. Ladled into big soup bowls and topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese this was a quick impromptu meal to be proud of.",

I think fennel seeds would also be a great addition if your not already using Italian sausage (some already have fennel seeds in the sausage). Also no Acini de Pepe pasta so I used 3/4 cup of small egg noodles. Came out great! This was a warming lunch = esspecially since MN weather went from 87 degrees on Monday to snow today!!
