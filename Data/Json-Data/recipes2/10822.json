It's perfectly seasoned with just a slight hint of heat. It really does take the guesswork out of making soup and fiddling with seasonings. The lemongrass ginger curry coconut lime flavors are already IN the broth so no fuss! I made this exactly as written and the only thing I'd suggest is adding more broth since the rice noodles absorb all the liquid (and it definitely doesn't reheat well because of this). I'd even suggest doubling the broth if you want a more soup-like consistency and serve immediately. Add in shrimp for protein and you got yourself a nicely balanced meal. This one's a keeper!",
