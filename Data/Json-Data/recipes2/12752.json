However I did insert little chips of the garlic into the meat with a knife tip and added some oregano and diced onion to the seasoning. I used a large can of the concentrate. I decided to marinate the roast in a large bag turned it a few times and refrigerated it overnight. When ready to cook I dumped the contents of the bag over the roast before putting it into the oven. When it was done I scooped out some of the liquid stirred it in a pan with a bunch of ice cubes til' the fat congealed skimmed the fat and used the result as a wonderful sauce - no need to thicken. Served on a platter rimmed with spinach garnished with a few slices of clementine orange blueberries & fresh mint - Easter dinner guests raved!",

After rubbing with margarine added salt and pepper (less salt and more pepper) and oregano seasoning and rubbed into the meat. Had a rosemary (essential) oil and added a few drops to the meat. It came out tasting wonderful especially with the lemonade concentrate. Next time will try to added garlic chips and rosemary springs into the meat and see what the result will be. 2015-December 24 UPDATE Made it again. This time did not have any oregano and made it with Ms. Dash Lemon Pepper minced garlic dried rosemary and rosemary (essential) oil but forgot to rub it with butter at the start. Hence melted the butter and added it before roasting the leg. Again it turned out beautifully. This recipe is easy to make some slight changes but with wonderful results. If you use this recipe you will definitely NOT need the mint jelly to go with this lamb.",
