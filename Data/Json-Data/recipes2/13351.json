Already had basil growing in the house and had some cherry tomatoes left from another dish.  I didn't have rotini so I used penne pasta.  The only thing I did differently was to add some pasta water and a bit of the cheese while the skillet was still on the heat.  This would probably be great with shrimp as well.  Thank you, Brandy, this one is a keeper!",
