Expected more of a kick, but still they were good.\" W/ the Sriracha, chili powder & jalapeno, I anticipated fire-breath w/ these, but they were surprisingly tame (well, OK, I wouldn't have given one to my pre-schooler), but I like things scorching. I used finely-crushed Saltine crackers (out of bread crumbs), and frozen corn (a handful of what was left in a bag to avoid opening a can.) I skipped the \"coat-in-flour\" step and formed, wrapped, and froze mine instead, b/c everytime I make chick pea or BB patties, I find that freezing them holds them together much better, and they go directly from freezer to skillet w/ no problems. I did mine in EVOO and ate alongside a basic salad, rather than burger-style. Nummy!",
