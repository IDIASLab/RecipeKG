My quesadillas did not include green peppers, barbecue sauce or Cheddar cheese.  Rather, I used thinly sliced onion, sliced mushrooms and shredded Provolone cheese on smaller tortillas.  I seasoned my shaved steak with a little of Emeril's BAM seasoning and garlic powder.  After cutting the quesadillas into wedges, I served them with horseradish cream sauce and honey mustard on the side.  WOW!",
