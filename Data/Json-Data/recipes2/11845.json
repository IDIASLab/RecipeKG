I used Tomato sauce instead of paste added Italian seasoning and a bit of brown sugar to counter the acidity. As per another website I also added a pat of butter at the very end - it's supposed to smooth out the sauce and help eliminate acidity. To put this recipe to a real test I bought the store's cheapest pasta sauce. The end result is really great. The benefit of going this route rather than the 'totally from scratch' route is a shorter cooking time and really a more reliable end product. I would use this for company any time.",

I also added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar. I let this simmer for a little over two hours. My jarred sauce was a more expensive quality and I used a good bottle of burgundy. VERY GOOD.

Hell when I make sauce from scratch I'll be d mned if I am going to grow tomatoes in a garden and spend a whole afternoon processing them. Bah! I just buy a 30 oz can of sauce some cans of fire roasted tomatoes and a few cans of paste anyway. Simpler that way.

This just isn t a quick weeknight meal where you brown some ground beef add a jar of sauce and then serve over some pasta. My husband bought a jar of Classico Basil and Tomato Pasta Sauce which has been sitting around collecting dust so I decided to give this recipe a try. If you re going to do this much prep work you might as well use canned tomatoes (fresh would be even better) and make your own spaghetti sauce rather than using a jar of pasta sauce as the base. The recipe also doesn't tell you when to add the mushrooms that you've saut\u00e9ed. We ate it but I thought it was just ordinary and not tasty enough to justify all of the prep work and the fairly long of ingredients that you'd be using if you made your own spaghetti sauce. Sorry for the bad review but this just didn't work for us.",

The only difference in mine is that I don't add the bell peppers, oregano (not a fan) or rosemary to the jarred sauce. I add one can of diced tomatoes, the red wine, fresh basil, onion (It can be dried, but I usually chop a fresh one) mushrooms, and a couple squeezes of tomato paste. Also add a bit of sugar, after tasting. The red wine gives it a richness and flavor level that is delicious, but you can leave it out, if preferred. I use either ground beef, or sometimes cooked italian sausage, sliced. This whole process takes 10 minutes, tops. To the complainers who said this takes almost as long as homemade,  you either didn't try it or you chop very slowly, plus homemade needs to simmer for quite some time to blend the flavors.  This is quick and delicious. Try it, you'll like it.",
