But I did remove a packet of cheese powder from kraft mac to use. I also made these changes: 1) I halved the recipe 2) I used olive oil instead of butter (didn't have it) 3) I used sour cream instead of milk (didn't have it) 4) I used part salsa and part Rotel tomatoes and chiles instead of pasta sauce (didn't have any) 5) I used Mexican blend and Swiss cheese because once again that's all I had. You could almost say I changed the whole thing but I wanted to post because this is a wonderful base recipe and it turned out great! thanks Chad!",

The only changes I made are to use 1 instead of 2 eggs (my hubby dislikes eggs and I didn't want him to see / taste them in the filling) stirred in 1/4 cup grated parm with the mac n cheese mixture and sprinkled on Italian seasoning and garlic powder instead of just oregano to the top. I think adding in some seasoned ground beef cooked with diced onions / peppers would be a great twist and will try it again with that variation. Thanks for sharing!:)",
