And finally the grill was not gonna happen in that weather. I covered a baking sheet with foil placed the soaked cedar planks on it and added the salmon then covered with sauce. Baked at 400 degrees for 25 minutes. Garnished with a little lemon zest and dried dill. Yes I came up with too much sauce also (at least the ingredients are easy to adjust!) but loved it ummmm maybe reserve some for dipping. Cannot wait to try this using the grill! Thanks Gay for a great recipe. I served this with rice and Garlic Spinach.",

We have salmon a lot here in the Pacific Northwest.
