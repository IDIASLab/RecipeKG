First, I cooked the bacon about halfway then added chopped onion, celery, carrots, and a couple cloves of garlic.  Cooked all together until the bacon was crispy and veggies soft. I used 2 bay leaves and put them in the milk while it simmered. Before I put the veggies in the milk I mixed the chopped potatoes and corn (I used frozen) in the pan with the bacon and cooked veggies to get some extra flavor. Let simmer on the stove and salt and peppered to taste. Great comfort dish on a chilly day.",
