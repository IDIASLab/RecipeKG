My lentils and rice were a little sticker than I had hoped for. Next time I would either use a bit less broth or bring the broth to a full boil for a few minutes before adding the rice and lentils. I also did not use the full amount of red onion. Orange and red bell peppers really brighten up the dish. The type of salad dressing used will either make or break this salad. I used a light Italian and that worked well. The nice thing is you could use different dressings to compliment the main dish. This would be a good recipe to make for vegetarians using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.",
