(I've tried) Find another recipe that calls for them.   A small dash each of wostershire, tabasco, fresh lemon juice, and a small crushed clove of garlic will really brighten up the flavor. I also add about 50% more cheese than called for and leave it in bigger chunks.  Definately let it sit for a day or two before serving.  That makes all the diffrence.",

Thank you for a perfect recipe!",

Definitely use high quality bleu cheese makes a dramatic difference in flavour. I used reduced fat sour cream but full fat mayo had a wonderful creamy texture. Also I highly recommend making it at least a day in advance to allow the flavours to meld. We liked this best w/veggies (cherry tomatoes red bell pepper and celery in particular).",

Also, you can control the level of blue cheese in the dip by just adding more or less of it.  I added more than the recipe called for, and it gave the dip a richer blue cheese taste; it did taste perfectly fine before the addition though.  Fantastic, will definitely make this again.",

Original review: I love blue cheese and so does my FIL. I made this for him for tomorrow for an appetizer. I tasted-tested it and I thought it was really good! I am serving with blue corn chips. Did not add the green onions subbed a pinch of onion pwdr. Sprinkled with garlic bread seasoning instead of garlic salt.",
