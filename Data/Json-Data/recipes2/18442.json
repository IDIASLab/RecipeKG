My only problem was that the garlic seemed to burn before the almonds were done which gave the finished product an interesting flavor. I also didn't have any fresh rosemary sprigs on hand so I used about 1/2 tsp. of dried crushed rosemary instead which worked just fine. Altogether this is an extremely quick easy and healthy snack. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!",

I used raw almonds so increased the baking time as suggested to 15 minutes which was almost too much so I'm not sure that's neccesary. When they came out of the oven I sprinkled them with about an addtitional 1/2 tsp of paprika and tossed them again in the same bowl.",
