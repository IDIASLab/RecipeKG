Since this was a half recipe, I just plopped the dough (it is sticky) onto the board and with Bisquick on my hands, shaped it into a round, approx 1\" thick. I then cut out the biscuits with a glass. I didn't think it was necessary to roll out this small amount, but I'm sure this would work for a full recipe as well if you just do it in two sections. The dough was very light and fluffy, just like the biscuits. I had one with butter but will be great with jam for breakfast! Thanks Heidi for a great recipe!",

These biscuits rise like crazy and ended up super light and fluffy. Served with the option of sausage gravy and/or with jam. Most took both. Raves from even the picky eaters.

I am usually a scratch cook but wanted to try this recipe as written. Now I will make a 'Bisquick substitute' without so much sodium. Other than that a very soft yet substantial biscuit to hold up under Sausage Cream gravy. Not sure they would work for 'ham biscuits' as my Grandmother's baking powder biscuits do. I don't ever attempt to roll out biscuit dough as the less you work it them more tender the result. Just sprinkle the board with flour and dust the top or your hands with a bit more and 'pat' the dough to the right thickness. Cut to size. I go to a 1-1 1/4\" thickness on these.",

They're the closest thing to the heavenly biscuits that my dear Southern grandmother made every day of her life for fifty-plus years -- light and fluffy rather than heavy and tough. Yes the dough is very wet but if you use plenty of flour on your hands and to dust the work surface it's not so difficult to manage. Here's a tip -- my father suggested that the dough would make good dumplings. He was right! I used a basic recipe for chicken and dumplings to stew the chicken and make the broth. Then I whipped up a batch of the biscuit dough patted it out pretty thinly cut it into small strips (about 3/4\" wide) tore the strips into suitable lengths and dropped them into the boiling broth. When making the dough for this purpose I used the flour sour cream and 7Up. I did not use any butter. The dumplings were very tender and fluffy.",
