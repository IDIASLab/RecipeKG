The tamari sauce takes the 'spice' out of the radish and complements its earthy flavor beautifully. Save the green tops from the radishes for steaming; they're delicious and nutritious.",

I gave half a fresh lime a good squeeze and that brightened the flavor. And I wouldn't skip the parsley it adds color to the salad as well as flavor (which it needs). Although its eye appeal is pretty nice when initially made it wilted quickly darkened in color and after chilling ended up more like a relish than a salad. If I were to make this again (doubtful) I would cut the olive oil back to 1 Tbsp (or less) and I would shred the radishes and refrigerate if I want to prep early in the day. I would then mix up right before serving to preserve freshness and crunchiness and boost the salad's presentation.",
