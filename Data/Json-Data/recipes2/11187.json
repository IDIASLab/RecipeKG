        "description": "Duck confit takes a while to prepare properly but is well worth the effort. This melt-in-your mouth duck treat will become a favorite. I buy whole ducks and then remove legs/wings whole and breasts from the bone. Always keep the skin on duck! You can easily double this recipe if you're having a dinner party. I learned this method from Chef Uriah of the Columbian Cafe of Astoria, Oregon. The breasts become pan roasted Muscovy duck (see my recipe) and the legs/wings become confit. Never roast a Muscovy duck whole: the breast comes out dry, musky, and bitter tasting.",

I halved the recipe and it worked great. Took 3 hours to cook. I also don't have a grill pan so I just crisped the skin in a regular skillet. The crispy skin is to die for! It is pretty rich so a little goes a long way! Thank you for the recipe!",
