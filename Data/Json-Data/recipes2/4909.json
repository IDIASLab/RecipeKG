Very easy to make and so easy to add other things into this dish. I wanted a bit more veggies so in the same large pan that I made the chicken breasts I added some sliced red pepper onion and zucchini. Also stirred in some fresh parsley. Mizithra cheese is hard to find but both Whole Foods and Trader Joes carried it as did King Soopers. It's a semi hard cheese and you can buy it pre-grated or you can grate it yourself. Really loved this tasty and very nutty flavor-y dish. Thank you!!",

While 5 oz pasta is cooking in salt water, i put 1/4 cup butter in a here is what I did:low heat cast iron and added 2 cloves coarse cut garlic. Let it brown turning garlic midway, about 5- 10 minutes. I used used some leftover deviled chicken thighs and rotisserie chicken, diced it and put in a bowl. Added fresh Marjoram, thyme and basil and tossed with the chicken.. Finely dice 1/2 cup mushrooms 1/4 yellow onion and 1/4 red bell pepper. Remove garlic brown butter from cast iron into a ramekin and set aside. Do not wipe out remaining butter. Add mushrooms, onion and bells to med temp cast iron and saut\u00e9 until tender and sweated. Add chicken and herbs and spinach and toss and warm through. Add splash of pasta water to steam. Drain pasta and add to cast iron and toss. Put a on a platter and top with 1/2 cup grated Mizithra cheese and drizzle brown butter and garlic on top. I Ike\u2019s served with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.",
