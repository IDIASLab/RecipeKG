I doubled the recipe so we could have extra filling for later. I used plain frozen corn and added a drained, rinsed can of black beans. I used chunky salsa which had the peppers chopped up in it.  I added the green onions to the mix. Lastly, I didn\u2019t make tostadas, I kept the tortilla soft and made wraps after warming them up a bit. I know this is quite a few changes, but I wouldn\u2019t have tried them without the inspiration from this recipe. Thank you!",
