I mixed the yogurt, ranch, mustard and half the cheese together and dipped the chicken in that first. Next I dipped the chicken in the panko, cheese, garlic and pepper. It was so good and I had no trouble with sogginess and it crisped up perfectly under the broiler. Thanks for a very tasty recipe.",

In place of the ranch dressing I used garlic powder, ground sage, ground rosemary and a pinch of thyme and I forgot to add the mustard, but honestly did not miss it.  My biggest issue was trying to get the mixture to stay where I put it on the chicken even though I had blotted the surface with a paper towel.  The final result was nice crisp, flavorful, moist chicken.  Thank you!",
