        "description": "Some people call this Rocky Road candy, but our grandma called it Heavenly Hash. Grandma or mom almost always made it for us around Christmas time. Grandma used to wrap each piece individually in plastic wrap, but I'm afraid I don't have that kind of patience. Either way, it looks pretty stacked up on a decorative plate and tastes heavenly as it melts in your mouth. If using a microwave to melt chocolate and butter, stir thoroughly between 30-second bursts until chocolate is completely melted.",

                "reviewBody": "Grandma s Heavenly Hash came together so quickly and easily. This is a nice short-cut for making 2.25 lbs. of candy. With the base being two types of chocolate plus butter this recipe has many possibilities for variations based on taste preferences. Because of the noticeable rich butter flavor and texture next time I will only use 1 stick/half cup. If salted nuts are included then use unsalted butter. Since I make all fudge recipes in my 7x11 pan the result is taller pieces of candy as you can see in the photo I posted.",
