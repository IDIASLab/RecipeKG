Like the 1st poster said this is a good \"base\" recipe to adapt to what you have on hand taste preferences and your creativity. If you like German bitters this will appeal to you. Overall it has a bitter tone that some may like and others not so much. The Kirschwasser to me is a strong alcohol as well as on the bitter side. If I made this again (and I will make it again) I would try cherry schnapps or a more 'recreational' alcohol to cut the bitter. For this recipe I ended up adding about 1 cup honey and 1/2 cup frozen orange juice concentrate to cut the bitterness. I also added 1tsp cinnamon and a couple shakes of nutmeg because I wanted more of the spice flavor. I used a house red wine with a \"cherry\" note to it. (Black Box Shiraz) It is a definitely alcoholic wonderful German version for Sangria. I like the taste and the taste gets better and better as I get to the bottom of the mug.:) Thanks to the author for such a unique and wonderful holiday beverage.",

I didn't have the Kirschwasser so I used one bottle of sweet cherry wine and one bottle of shiraz. (It is hard to find what type of red wine should be used most recipes don't say so I guessed) I also used ground nutmeg since I couldn't find a whole one same with the anise and I did add a few cloves. Followed the rest of the recipe and let it warm in the crock pot an hour or so and kept it warm all night while my friends and I enjoyed it. Next time I may add about 1/4 to 1/3 cup orange juice to counter balance the tartness from the cherries. Still very tasty though. I think my favorite part was eating the tart cherries.",
