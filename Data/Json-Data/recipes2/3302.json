It's a great base recipe to put your own personal twist on with other cheeses or seasonings. Experiment with the types of cheese you like in this; it's great with Asiago, Romano, or even a little sharp Cheddar. For an extra kick, add a touch of cayenne pepper or hot sauce.",

I was looking for an inexpensive fondue alternative and I found a keeper. Because Parmesan cheese is high in salt to begin with, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I also used regular cream cheese as that's what I had on hand. This turned out creamy and delicious. I served it with homemade bread and granny smith apples to dip. Both were delicious in this fondue. I will be making this again.",
