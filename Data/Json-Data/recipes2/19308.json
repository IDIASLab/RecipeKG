The soy sauce and onions bring out the true flavor of the beef and there is a very slight hint of asparagus (I used 4 pieces of asparagus per each instead of the recommended 3 so this is probably why). Overall this gets an A from me as it is fast to cook easy to prepare - after the first time - easy to remember and extremely filling.",

The dip really brought out the flavours and made this dish awesome. I highly recommend including the dip.",
