I had curly kale I was trying to use up. It's a bit spicy so those who don't like spicy food might want to reduce the amount of cayenne or chili powder. 40 minutes simmering left the rice a bit al dente, so check before you serve. Another hint: there are a lot of herbs and spices so measure them out ahead of time. It also reheats well.",
