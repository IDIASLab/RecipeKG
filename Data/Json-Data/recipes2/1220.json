I used angel hair pasta because it was all I had and wanted to use up shrimp I had on hand. I also didn't have parsley but did have fresh basil so I added that. Otherwise made it exactly as recipe said and it was delicious.  Topped with some parmesan since I didn't use ravioli with cheese. \n\nWill definitely use this recipe again.",
