My only tip - lightly toast the bread under the broiler on each side before adding the topping and broiling.  The bread holds up much better this way.  Otherwise I find that it tends to get a bit soggy.  Otherwise, delicious!!",

I only used two tablespoons of mayo and added a good splash of olive oil and ground pepper. It was still very creamy so I think you could get by with just 1 tablespoon of mayo. Also make sure you use the MARINATED artichoke hearts or these will be bland. These are quick and easy and a great change from the usual hors d'ouerves.",

I put all of it in a big bowl and put garlic bagel chips around the bowl for everyone to dip instead of putting it on the bread. Great recipe! Will make over and over! Thank you!!!",

I just can't imagine why some reviewers felt that these were bland...the only thing that I can think of is that unmarinated hearts were used.
