The color of the peanuts wasn't a reliable indicator as there was variation between the initial brownness and rate of color change between peanuts. I baked some raw peanuts in my oven for 15 minutes and found that they were overdone and tasted burnt. I tried another batch for 12 minutes with the same disappointing results. Finally I did a systematic experiment where I removed a peanut to taste at exactly 8 9 10 11 and 12 minutes. I found that 8 and 9 minute peanuts were underdone 11 and 12 minute peanuts were overdone and the 10 minute peanuts were just right. It's that sensitive!",
