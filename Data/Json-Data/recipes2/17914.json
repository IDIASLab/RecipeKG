The 4 minute time I gave is figurative. It really depends on your microwave. Most newer models have a button to push for potatoes, which will cook them to sufficient doneness. If yours does not, it may take several minutes to cook the potatoes through. Just MAKE SURE you poke them full of holes (to avoid a MESSY microwave) and turn them after atleast 4 minutes, if your microwave does not have a turntable. Other than that, I'm glad you all enjoy the potatoes!\r\n\r\n",

Mash it with a fork and throw it back in at the end for two minutes with some bacon bits and cheese on top. All in all good recipe to fiddle with.",
