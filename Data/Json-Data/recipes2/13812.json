My Way: I marinated the chicken for 1 hour in the wine and herbs but added 1/2 lemon for greater acidity. Dipped them in an egg bath and then dusted them with a mixture of 30/70 Flour/Parmesean Cheese (grated not shreded) and pan fried it. I was suprised the sauce went so well over the crusted chicken breast. Also I blanched my Asparagus instead of steaming them; but that is just a personal prefrence. Great Recipe!!",

I ended up cooking it in my oven at 375 on a broiling pan for 25 minutes. This is because I do not have a grill. It worked out fine and I would make this dish again.",
