Maybe the cheese should've been frozen lightly first before slicing and handled quickly while battering? I couldn't find any herbed goat cheese so I rolled the round over a light sprinkling of herbs de provence. My parents who are usually afraid of odd pairings of flavors really liked it. It's unique and exotic and made my hors d'oevres spread look very exotic. Ooh la la!",
