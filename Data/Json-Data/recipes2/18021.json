Instead of using Cool Whip, which I am not a real fan of, I used name brand ice cream, let it melt for a few minutes and using my hand mixer, I blended in a Butterfinger chocolate bar into the semi-melted ice cream.  I used this as my layer between the ice cream sandwiches and on top.  I also used a loaf pan and lined it with plastic wrap for easy removal of the cake.  Once the ice cream cake was semi-hardened, I drizzled melted chocolate on the top.  My kids loved it and my husband said it was better than Baskin Robbins!\nThis recipe is a keeper!!

I had to use 23 ice cream sandwiches. For those who said it was too rich perhaps try another hot fudge sauce remember you are using a whole can on this! Thanks so much for the excellent recipe!

So I ended up doing only one layer of those. I poured the chocolate fudge over that and added the entire amount of whipped cream on top of that(it seemed like just enough for one layer so I'm not sure there would have been enough if I'd done two layers like the recipe called for). I crushed up some Oreo's and a Milky Way bar and added that to the top then drizzled the whole thing with caramel. I was very frustrated making this since it wasn't going as planned but the kids liked it so I guess I'll make it again...with more ingredients on hand.",
