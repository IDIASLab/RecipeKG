The bacteria spores that cause botulism are called Clostridium botulinum, and they can spread in certain foods when not exposed to oxygen\u2014as is the case when infusing garlic in oil.",

This makes a great dipping oil for bread, a tasty salad dressing, and delicious when sauteeing meat or grilling veggies. The only thing I did slightly differently was to use use fresh rosemary without drying it, only bc I was a little impatient. I used the back of the knife to bruise the leaves in order to infuse more flavor into the oil. Perfect!",
