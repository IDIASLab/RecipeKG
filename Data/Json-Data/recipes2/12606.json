They crisped up nicely on the outside and were plenty tender with those mashed potatoes & stuffing inside. If you have any turkey gravy left over I think a drizzle over the croquettes would be good. I also think these would be a good candidate to go into the freezer and baked later and also could be finger food or a buffet table candidate. Weeble very very nice recipe thanks for sharing!",

I didn't have any stuffing so I saut\u00e9ed an onion added 1/2 C of peas and a whole bunch of seasoning to the mixture. Instead of panko and butter for breading I used 50/50 plain breadcrumbs and parmesan. I needed far more breading than the recipe called for. I made mine golf-ball size and I think I baked these at 400. My family LOVED these and they kept asking me to make more. The entire turkey leftovers wound up being turned into these croquets.",
