I bought one last year, and it works great on this recipe.  Of course, so does a good mixer on high speed.  It really fluffs it up.  \n\nI, too, add vanilla, or cinnamon, or even cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also like adding small bits of dried fruit sometimes.  My family really loves that.  \n\nAgain, I'm so glad everyone enjoys this! \n\n*Edited to add: Some people say it's way too sweet. Others say it's nowhere near sweet enough.  This is personal taste.  To me, and to many of my friends, it's not very sweet at all.  In fact, my best friend who owns a bakery uses this recipe in her store, and she's decided she prefers almost equal amounts. \n\nIf you aren't sure what you'll like, start with a stick of butter , whipped in a mixer, then start adding honey by the teaspoon until you like it.",
