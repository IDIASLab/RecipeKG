I used 2 fresh chicken breasts chopped into bits and cooked with half a package of Taco Seasoning mix (which allowed me to omit the other spices) and about 1/4 cup of water after browning the onions and mushrooms. Use whatever you have in your refrigerator. It made a nice glaze. I also cooked 1 cup of long grain white rice the day before (use that leftover Chinese white rice or any flavor) and add it to the chicken, whole kernel corn, black beans (all drained) and 1 small jar of Pace Salsa. I simmered it until all the seasonings combined. Super quick and simple.\nI then put it into a olive oil sprayed 9x13 pan topped with Mexican blend cheese and crumbled tortilla chips. I baked at 350 for 1/2 hour.  You could bake less since everything is already cooked. Baking it and letting it set a little while just adds to the end flavor. Top with sour cream and chives when serving. This tastes better heated the next day, if your lucky enough to have left overs! :-) My husband can't wait until I make it again-so easy, tasty and quick!",
