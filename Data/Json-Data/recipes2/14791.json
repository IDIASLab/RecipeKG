My husband brought some leftovers for work today and it filled the lunchroom with a extra special aroma - everyone wanted to know what he had. I made this with \"Scalloped potatoes and Onions\" - a recipe on this site. The potatoes cooked at 325 along with the ham. We had a Great dinner. Delicious !!!
