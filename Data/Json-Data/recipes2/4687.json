I have boiled with vinegar, baking soda, or salt. I have cooked with a slow simmer and a high boil. I have removed from heat and covered with cold water and I have baked in the oven. THIS one worked. I was afraid to try it. I followed the directions and there it was! A perfectly cooked egg that peeled very easily. A \"hard boiled\" egg that peeled easily was my biggest obstacle until I tried this one. Thank you, bd! I will use your recipe from now on!\"",

I had saved this hard steam method for cooking eggs some time after Easter.  My deviled eggs on that occasion were an unusual epic fail, mostly due to egg shells that had a bad case of separation anxiety.  I would like to say that I followed this recipe to the letter, but unfortunately I failed to read directions correctly and didn't use eggs at room temperature.  When I caught my error, I was able to adjust the steaming time by adding a couple minutes.  Even with my goof, the eggs turned out perfectly cooked, with beautiful yellow (no hint of green) yolks, and shells that peeled off like a dream.  Keeper!",

Don't overlook that it says to start with \"room temperature' eggs. I didn't have a steamer so I used a strainer in my dutch oven (for a dozen eggs). I covered but left slightly ajar. It worked beautifully. Peeling was SO EASY!! Everyone here was laughing at me cuz each egg was slightly cracked for coloring eggs: D! Never will I 'boil' eggs again. Thank you Bd.weld for this great method! (added 9-4-15): Ok so I forgot to put a small crack in each egg. And only left in ice water about 15 min. Not as perfect/easy as cracking and leaving in longer but MUCH MUCH better. So I will skip that cracking step and the extra minutes in ice water.",
