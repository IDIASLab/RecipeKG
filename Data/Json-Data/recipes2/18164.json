I did make a few changes however: 1 onion instead of 2 used a liberal amount of \"pumpkin spice\" instead of just cinnamon (pumpkin spice = cinnamon nutmeg and something else?) added one tsp. of salt fresh ginger instead of candied two dashes of cayenne pepper for spice the juice of one fresh navel orange instead of OJ and lastly I used 1/4 cup real whipping cream and a little bit of skim milk. I will definitely make this again! Be sure to blend it well; the end result is better than at some of the top restaurants I've eaten in!",
