The \"cheese sauce\" turned into a big clump and I had to add more cream (half and half) to make it anywhere near sauce like. Then when it cooled it was nearly solid. I added the bacon milk and mayonnaise and used my immersion blender to blend it together. There are still lumps of cheese sauce visible.
