I made changes to suit my fancy: instead of just celery and carrot I also added chopped white onion and red bell pepper and the other change was to use a can of mixed stir fry veg instead of just the water chestnuts. Since we were camping I followed the skillet directions on the rice package and to keep our grubby hands off our food I shredded the lettuce and turned it into rice bowls. Thanks for the simple and tasty recipe! Will definitely take this one camping again and again!",

I got distracted chopping the veggies and shredding the carrot and totally spaced out the rice until I thought it was too late. Nope! That is the beauty in Uncle Ben's Ready Rice.

These are perfect for a buffet style so everyone controls the amounts they want. Thank you Baking Nana for this recipe. Update 20 June 2015. I've made this three times now and each time it gets better. I've added sliced baby corn and some fresh ginger. Today I used heads of baby romaine and served them as appetisers. It is important to leave the veggies a bit crunchy for that extra bump of flavour. I also have been using chicken breasts sliced super thin instead of ground. Such a versatile recipe!",
