It was great right out of the mixing bowl but I am anxious to see how good it got after it sat a few days. This would be great on brisket or roast beef!",

They were spot on. There is a big difference in flavor. 2) I used half the amount of vinegar called for. For 1/2 a batch I used 2 tablespoons. Wait and taste next day to compare. This was a matter of taste for me.\nThis sauce is good on so many things. I may even try it on a flip flop.\nThanks for the recipe!",

If you like hot and spicy, this sauce is very versatile. But be warned, it's not for the faint of heart!!!",

With the ratio of spice, this is actually milder than I thought it would be but that means more people will enjoy it.
