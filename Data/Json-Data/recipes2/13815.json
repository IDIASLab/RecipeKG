After this is complete I remove chicken and keep warm. I heat the spaghetti sauce through (omitting the broth step and also the onions). I place the chicken breast on the cooked spaghetti then place the spaghetti sauce on top and then the final touch is sprinking mozzarella cheese on top. If you add the cheese quickly to the hot spaghetti sauce it will melt on its' own. My son also likes for me to sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top of the spaghetti noodles prior to placing the chicken on top.",
