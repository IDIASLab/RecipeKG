I tried to fix it but couldn't cut through the protein powder taste. To the credit of the submitter I find this issue in all smoothies with these powders and usually do not use them. Why the skins did not dissolve I do not know. Never had that issue in my Vitamix. The smoothie was also a luke warm despite the ice cube. I have made numerous smoothies in my blender but it appears others enjoyed this!",
