Its going to be good and it should be enough to feed 3 for a couple days. Good food for when your under the weather.

I read the other reviews and tasted it with one cube and it was okay but I did think it needed more BUT I like the salt. I added another cube and a shake of parsley and a bit of black pepper (personal preference with anything egg) and I think it tasted better than the typical egg drop. Next time I will not let my potatoes get as done as they did but again just a personal preference and nothing do do with the taste. SO simple and SO satisfying. You could even put in some peas and carrots if you wanted. Egg Drop is a MUST for me when I stir-fry and I will definitley be making this soup again. Thank you!",
