                "reviewBody": "This recipe turned out fantastic for our family. I did make several changes however after reading the prior reviews. I skipped the cheese and dumped the beef and onion mix into an 8x8 pan. Initially I tried the 9x13 dish but the mix didn't quite cover the bottom enough for my personal liking. I added a cup of frozen crinkle coin carrots and a cup of frozen corn to the baking pan and tossed everything in our favorite hickory bbq sauce. Since others seemed to have issues with both the volume and the taste of the batter I cut the batter portion in half and added 1tsp onion powder 1tsp garlic powder and ground a little rosemary over it. I wanted the topping to taste like biscuits rather than pancakes and I thought this would be more suited to what I was aiming for. We baked for the 35 minutes others suggested and we were very pleased with the results. I will definitely be making this again and I really appreciate a recipe using ground beef and Bisquick in such a non-traditional way. Thanks so much for this recipe!!",

The recipe didn't say whether to drain the fat from the browned beef-and-onion mixture but I opted to do so. The \"6 servings\" were pretty decently-sized portions and I enjoyed them over 4 or 5 days. I do slightly agree with the reviewers who complained about there being too much topping and not enough of the rest. The topping was quite tasty though - just perhaps a bit too much. I just might make this again soon - it's easy economical and quite filling.",
