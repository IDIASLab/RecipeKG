I only used one and that was not enough for me so I will probably add another next time. Thank you for the great recipe!*****\n\n*****I have been making this recipe for three years now!!! And will continue for years to come. Of course I have switched it up now and then and my favorite way is to pound out the chicken, mix up some cream cheese and shredded mozzarella, place of ball of the cream cheese mixture in the center and roll the chicken over, secure with toothpicks. I love the flavor of the cream cheese and hot flavored chicken. Yum! Yum! Yum!\n",

The other change I made was I tied the rolls with string instead of using toothpicks to secure the rolls during cooking. This dish was easy to make and was a hit at my house. My 2 year old even liked it! We are not big blue cheese or Ranch dressing fans so I served Goya yellow rice and a fresh garden salad with it. Thank you D and S Parker!! I hope you have some additional recipes to share.",

I didn't bother pounding out the chicken breast - it was still tender the next day after baking and microwaving. Delicious with Paul Newman Ranch dressing. I just cut each chicken breast in half then marinated in a zip lock bag. 5 minute prep time seriously. I actually forgot about it for a while so I left it in there for about a day and a half. Still good! Because I made this for lunches this week I left the cheese off and threw a piece on before microwaving it (40 seconds). This freezes well - I made a bunch (and froze them) for my boyfriend and sent it back on a 5 hour flight and it worked great. Served it with ranch dressing what a QUICK and easy meal!",

The mixture solidified a little but it was still good. Not to spicy at all. Used sliced prolone instead of shredded because its easier to roll. Only used about 1 1/2 slices per breast next time I will double. Served with blue cheese. This will now become a regular on my dinner menu. I am also on a low-carb diet and I am going to take the other reviewers suggestion of putting this chicken on salad. I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed these and they were so simple. 2 forks up!!",
