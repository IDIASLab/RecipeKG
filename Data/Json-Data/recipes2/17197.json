Okay, now I want to add to my original review.  I had the leftovers cold for lunch the next day.  I added a few pecans and some cold leftover orange roughy.  This was really good.  The flavor developed quite a bit overnight, and the raisins added a nice sweetness.  I'll make this again, but will chill it overnight and serve it cold.",

Quick elegant and tasty. Only use very fresh asparagus; if not it will taste bitter.",
