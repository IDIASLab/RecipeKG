I put the casserole together and put it in the fridge for about 5 hours before I cooked it I thought it would get too mushy but it didn't. My kids did not like it but they also are not stuffing fans but every adult that tried it loved it! We made mashed potatoes as a side and had turkey gravy to pour over everything. The gravy is defiantly a must since the casserole is on the dry side and we even had it the next day as leftovers it still tasted Great! This is defiantly going to be a staple in our family! UPDATE I've made this many times over the past year and I've finally tried it w/ chicken.. it defiantly tastes better w/ the turkey! I made this recipe with the chicken and my parents didn't know why I made such a big deal about this recipe but I made it again for them w/ the turkey they said it was a much better recipe.",
