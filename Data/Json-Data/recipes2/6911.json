I did rinse the beans to rid them of excess salt and it may just be me but I could tell the difference. We used it to top tacos in quesadillas as well as a dip for chips. Also I added just a dash of cayenne. It's now a raceday staple. Thanks for posting it.",

Only regular black beans on hand so I used those. I had to use canned corn so I dried it very well and sort of 'roasted' it in a pan (I know it's not the same but it worked). Everyone really enjoyed this...I will def be making it again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
