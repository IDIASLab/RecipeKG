Some temps and times that work for me:  I heat the milk (1/2 gal) in a double boiler to 180 degrees for 30 minutes,  cool to 110 degrees in a cold water bath, add the starter (buy a cup of plain yogurt with live cultures), place in a warm place (oven with towel, etc.) for 8-24 hours.  The longer it rests and grows the tarter it will be.  Special note- resist the urge to check what is happening, the only failure I had was because I stirred the yogurt 6 hours in to the process.  You can strain the yogurt at this point or after you have refrigerated it.  Strain the yogurt to thicken it (greek style).   I use a colander with coffee filters to strain the yogurt.  The left over byproduct (whey) can be used in soups or oatmeal recipes.  1/2  of the yogurt will be whey by volume.  It has protein and a unique flavor.  I keep back a 1/4 cup  starter for the next batch.  1/2 gallon batches are plenty for our family of 3 for a couple of weeks.",

After that you can use part of what you made as the starter  (also like homemade sourdough, and no one would dispute that\u2019s indeed homemade!) as long as you have Something to use for the culture.
