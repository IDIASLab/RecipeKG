I've made risotto multiple times with practically the same ingredients and recipe just (arborio) rice instead of barley and cooking the mushrooms with the rice for most of the simmering time and that turns out much better. Rice exudes a better flavor than the barley. So if you're considering taking the time to make a risotto I'd suggest you do a real one: with rice not barley!",

I sauteed the onions in butter and olive oil and then added the dry barley and sauteed until the barley browned slightly, then added the mushrooms, thyme (about 1.5 tsp) and garlic. I omitted the bay leaf. I used 4 cups of nonfat, low sodium chicken broth, with one cup of water.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it did come out surprishingly creamy, like risotto.  Today while heating some of the leftover, I added a little milk and cheese and it was DELICIOUS.  I'd recommend about 1/4 to 1/3 cup each romano, cheddar, and whole milk to the full recipe if you want to make it cheesey.  The stronger the cheese the less you need to use to add a little kick.  This is a keeper!",
