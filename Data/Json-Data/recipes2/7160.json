This was perfect because it's not too sweet. I actually forgot to add the honey in my haste and I don't even miss it. While I like coconut butter for cooking I couldn't bring myself to add it to the smoothie so I used unsweetened coconut flakes instead and I didn't have blackberries so I used raspberries and blueberries. It made a pretty purple drink. I've always used chia seeds but never noticed before they are a great iron calcium and protein source as well as fiber. Added bonus is this doesn't use frozen banana (a mainstay of my normal smoothie) so I might actually get my kid to try it.;)",
