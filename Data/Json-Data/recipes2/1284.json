I think next time I'll also double the beef because I found myself wanting more. I topped mine with green onions and shredded cheddar cheese. I served it with a mound of white rice in the center of each bowl, as you can see in my photo. I will definitely be making this again!",

Melt 3 Tbsp. of butter in a pan on medium heat. Add 3 Tbsp. of flour. Stir and cook at least five minutes. Add beef broth slowly to the roux while stirring. It should immediately begin to thicken. Bring to a simmer while stirring to avoid lumps. Add to stew and stir. Cook for at least 5-10 minutes until incorporated.The bread bowl was the perfect way to eat this stew! I used the Reynolds liners which makes it a breeze to clean up.",

I made a roux with butter and flour then added the juice to make a delicious gravy. There is probably an easier way but gravy intimidates me so I made it the sure-fire way. I added the meat etc. back in to reheat. Next time I will add a bit more heat and extra carrots. I served it over white rice with a layered Mexican dip and tortilla chips.",
