(I did use sugar free chocolate syrup.) I didn't need as much ice because I used the frozen banana. My husband was kind of meh about it but I thought it was great as did my kids. (They made no bones about finishing off Daddy's cup.) This one's a keeper! NOTE: I usually keep a pitcher of premade coffee in my fridge. I used cold coffee in this recipe. I learned from working for Seattle's Best that if you don't want to water down your coffee you usually will use cold coffee or add your cold milk then coffee.",
