It's easy and quick and I had most of the ingredients to make this for lunch today. I did do a few things differently bc I'm not a fan of cooking in the microwave--just a quirk of mine. I put on the toppings (minus the top layer of cheese) then broiled in the oven for a minute or two then added some Italian seasoning and the cheese topping broiled a few more minutes then topped with the second tortilla and broiled again until it start to brown (which takes less than a minute). If you broil definitely keep an eye on it as it can burn quickly! Then I put it on a plate and cut into wedges from there. I made two different kinds--one with mushrooms one with olives bc bf doesn't like olives and I don't like mushrooms. I think next time I might try frying it on the stovetop like a quesadilla--the bottom got a little soggy but nothing we couldn't handle. Thanks for the recipe!",
