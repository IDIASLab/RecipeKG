Also used shredded cheese because I had some on hand and chopped rather than sliced my Cameo apple(not GS- a good fresh Cameo is the BEST) and completely forgot the walnuts. It was all good anyhow:) Could play w/ salad ingredients and still have it be tasty. A fast nice change to encourge our spinach usage.
