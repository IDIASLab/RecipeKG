I called it my \"leftover frittata\" because I had leftover rice (about a cup and a half) and I also added some leftover boiled potatoes. I used peas instead of edamame turkey bacon and also added a fair amount of shredded cheese to the egg and sour cream mix. I was so impressed with how it came out beautiful and full and puffy and everyone cleaned their plates no complaints about the peas! I think the potatoes added a really good flavor. I had to cook it for about 16 minutes in the oven because it was quite thick. I did make quite a few changes to the recipe but it's only because I was trying to use up what was in my kitchen. I think the original recipe is a great basic recipe and you can add in whatever you have on hand.",
