To make a 9x13 pan, I add 2 1/2-3 cups of COOKED long-grain rice (we prefer Basmati rice), add carrots to the celery to make about 2 1/4 cups (the carrots add more flavor than the celery alone), no more than 1 cup mayo, DEFENITLY add 2 cans of cream of chicken and if the mixture seems to dry add some milk until it looks better, and instead of topping with plain cornflakes use Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds!!! The honey gives it an awesome added flavor, it seemed to be the flavor that was missing after I made it the first time word for word from the orginal recipe. Oh, and I only cooked it for 20-30 minutes until it was warm. HIGHLY Recommend!!!",

I tweaked it a little to suit our tastes, and the results were amazing. Here's what I did: - shredded the chicken instead of chopping into cubes; - used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken; \n- used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream; - finely diced the celery and sauteed it until soft; - used the water that I poached the chicken breasts in to cook the rice; - added pepper to taste; - doubled the amount of corn flake topping;  - baked casserole (without topping) for 30 minutes, then added the topping and baked for the final 15 minutes. Adding the topping in the last 15 minutes keeps the corn flakes from over-browning. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! :)",

I added chopped green pepper and carrots to increase the amount of vegetables and make it more of a one-pot meal. I added some fresh chopped rosemary to the veggies and some grated parmesan cheese to the soup/mayo mixture. These added a lot to the overall flavor. Since I had no cornflakes I made breadcrumbs by whirling a crust of bread in the food processor with some more parmesan cheese. Instead of feeding 12 cutting back on the rice and adding more veggies meant it fed four easily.",

As it was I followed some previous reviewers' advice and doubled the soup and added more sour cream than mayo. It also used brown rice and bulked up the almonds and celery. I think it needs a little more in the way of seasoning and I can't imagine it coming out right with only one can of soup. Also i think I might try sliced sauteed mushrooms next time - and possibly as other reviewers mentioned I might try toasting the almonds to add to the flavor. It was a good base for a casserole but could definitely use some tweeking based on personal tastes.",

I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken. I cut up the chicken and cooked it in the same pan as the celery and onion but I added a bit of olive oil. Since the casserole bakes for 45 mins I did not cook the chicken very long in the skillet(5 mins or so) I topped the casserole with durkee fried onions instead of the potato chips/butter.
