To please the masses, I have taken to substituting the olives for half a 250ml jar of (chopped) Old El Paso pickled jalapenos and it's an absolute hit every time I make it! It's got quite the kick, but people REALLY love it. I've made this at least 25 times now and I have to say that using old or sharp cheddar is a MUST, as is serving with original Ritz crackers.

The texture is a little chunky as another reviewer mentioned but I added extra ingredients so I can't say for sure if the original recipe would be as chunky. I didn't have any fresh onion on hand so I had to use onion powder but I added in some diced sundried tomatoes in olive oil. I think this really brought some beautiful color as well as an extra dimension of smooth/salty flavor to the recipe.",
