I got this recipe from a restaurant in Green Bay called St. Brenden's. I usually make this on a Saturday afternoon when I have some free time (and freeze it all), but I have made it on a week night and only froze two portions. Triple the pesto ingredients and use one portion tonight; freeze the rest for later.",

I cooked up the shallots and garlic as directed but then I decided to put in 3 T ready-made pesto and 2/3 c. heavy cream (because I only had a total of 1 cup). While that reduced I cooked the chicken though I decided to take some out and set it aside because it looked like too much chicken per sauce. Then I added the rest of the cream to that mix and reduced it another 15 min. We already had angel hair from the night before so we used that though I would use a smaller chunkier pasta next time. overall it was great.",

The garlic got too brown in the first 5 mins, even though my stove was on 3. When I added the basil & parmesan...things went downhill. It all clumped together. The basil was frying, not wilting. The picture shows nice big pieces of basil, yet it says to chop it. It was a mess. It also did not say anything about pouring off the remaining oil before the cream. There was still ALOT of oil in that pan. Now Im trying to figure out how to make dinner with the cut up chicken that I have left.",

It is great comfort food even if we did eat it on a 90-degree day!",
