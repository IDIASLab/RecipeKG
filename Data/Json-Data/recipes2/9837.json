Tip: Because corn syrup and whiskey are the only ingredients that add moisture to help stick together the best way to mix is to remove all jewelry wash hands vigorously and use your hands to mix. I hesitated in doing this and used a mixing spoon. However had to add a little more corn syrup and whiskey for it to hold together which I wouldn't suggest doing.",

Without a food processor it would not have been the same. Some other recipes don't call for a food processor",

Only because I think that gives the BEST flavor of Pecans.  I made half with Coconut and half without in case someone doesn't like Coconut at the Party that I am bringing these to shortly.. \nThey took me a LONG time to make.Start to finish about 2.5 hours but I am NO Baker so that probably lengthened the time.  I used my Food Processor for probably the first time in 10 years LOL.  \n I used a Melon Ball to start the \"Ball\" and I wound up with just over 50 Bourbon Balls at the last count. \nI had to taste one to make sure they were delicious and THEY ARE !\n I took the tip from someone to NOT put in extra Bourbon. They are the Perfect amount of Bourbon with what the recipe calls for.  \nCan't wait to see them go...and I know they will. So Hat's off to MeeMaw.  This is a keeper.",

I made a couple of modifications by adding a tsp more of corn syrup and a couple of tsps of melted salted butter. The salt was a good addition because it added flavor to the balls. The corn syrup and butter made the batter less crumbly and easier to work with. They helped the confectioner's sugar and coconut adhere to the balls better and enhanced the flavor.",
