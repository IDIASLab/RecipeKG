Didn't use the anchovy. I added prosciutto artichoke calamata olives dried tomatoes in oil and added some of that oil did more like 3 tbs chopped garlic and 3 scallions chopped. Put over thin spaghetti... I added some goat cheese to mine and loved it. My husband added thin slices of a hard italian cheese. Will definitely make it again.",

It was very good but I felt it still needed something additional like a flavorful cheese added on top. I had mozzarella and used that which was good but think I'll try feta for next time. Make sure the wine you use is one that you really like the flavor of because that flavor comes through strong and can dominate the dish.",
