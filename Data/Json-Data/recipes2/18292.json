I did use 'I can't Believe It's Not Butter\" spray in lieu of the butter (0 calories) but evenso the website that I use to track my calories clocked this at 260 calories per 2- leg serving. I am not sure where the discrepancy is. Next time I will use less hot sauce and omit the Splenda because I do not feel it needs it. But overall good recipe! Thanks!",
