Allow to sit for several hours, then dab off excess moisture w/a paper towel.  Eggplant is just like a sponge so to prevent more sogginess VERY LIGHTLY brush on olive oil; broil on a rack until very nicely browned on both sides. Young eggplant skin is more tender, so you won't have to peel it. Use fruits that are about 2 1/2\" at their widest part. I needed 2-3 to make four sandwiches. This gives a really meaty texture without sogginess OR being overdone. To sweeten the loud garlic, after dicing it, I cooked it in a bit of olive oil until soft (do not brown or it will turn bitter), then mashed it before adding to the mayo.",

The skin on mine got a little tough after it was cooked and slice the eggplant into 1/2-inch slices. When they're too thin they do come out crispy! Instead of brushing with oil I sprayed the slices with cooking spray and dusted with salt and pepper. I used light mayo and reduced the amount to cut calories. I added 1/4-1/2 tsp garlic powder instead of the garlic cloves because I was short on time. It was delicious!",

You should try instead to microwave the eggplant for about 1 1/2 minutes, or until the centers are cooked, then melt margarine in a large skillet over medium heat and fry them until lightly toasted on each side. That's how it's done in the eggplant burger recipe on this site that's fantastic! They come out perfectly. If the eggplant hadn't been ruined, this recipe might've been good.",
