I have never roasted tomatoes in an oven for a long period of time and may do that again for another salad. When I went to make it I then realized the tomatoes needed to roast for a full 2.5 hours. I planned to make this at lunch time and decided to put them under the broiler on low on a foil lined sheet sprayed with some PAM. It took 45 minutes instead with the rack placed in the middle of the oven. They still got a nice slow roast. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly just reducing the green onion some and subbing red wine vinegar because my grocer did not carry the sherry vinegar. That seemed to work fine. Personally I know this recipe is all about the avocados presenting but I kind of liked it all stirred up. I thought the other vegetables picked up some of the flavors from the tomatoes which I really liked. That is how I served it after taking the photo. This does take a little time to prepare with 3 separate components but I like the mix of 3 vegetables anyhow in the dish. ty",

I either roast or microwave the asparagus in olive oil first til almost done then add the mushroom just to soften it and finish cooking the asparagus. Let it cool. Lots of times I end up eating frozen dinners which always include frozen corn. So I let that cook about halfway so it doesn't get mushy. I let the corn cool and I add that too. Then I add the tomato and avocado. Toss. If I have it I add some feta along with the feta \"juice\" for dressing. If I don't have feta I just use lime juice salt and pepper toss and voila'!
