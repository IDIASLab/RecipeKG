                "reviewBody": "This was tasty but there are a few things that I would do differently in the future. First if you re browning boneless chicken breasts for 8 mins/side (total of 16 mins) you really do not have to then simmer it for one hour. That much time actually changes the texture of the chicken breast making it a little stringy and dry. I would cut back that time DRAMATICALLY. Also the sauce is sooooo good on its own that I will skip the half-and-half and parmesan in the future and just serve the chicken with the rich tomato-marsala sauce. You ll save a lot of calories and fat by eliminating that parmesan sauce (2 cups is way too much parmesan) and I think the dish would have MUCH better presentation without it. I don t think that the parmesan sauce added much flavor and it really didn t develop into a smooth and creamy sauce. As I always do I try to make a recipe as written the first time and the only thing I did differently was add some mushrooms they're an important and traditional ingredient for chicken marsala. This is quite a different combo of ingredients and I will make this again but with the modifications mentioned above. One final comment the recipe name is a bit of a misnomer because there really isn't anything in it that makes it spicy.",
