I still got the buttery taste and texture from the avocado that I love. So not great but definitely a good starting off point to rework.",

I had to add some feta as I didn't quite have enough cheddar and it needed salt so I added 1/2 teaspoon. I also added shrimp per the footnoted variations but saluted them in garlic and oil. I also cooked some diced zucchini at the some time and then pur\u00e9ed it with the avocado and cheese so that it would be a meal complete with veggies. I used an immersion blender. I usually don't write reviews when I make this many changes but in this case I don't think it affected the flavor much.",

I added in some sour cream and feta cheese to make it a little creamier (and of course less healthy -ha) and I left out the nutmeg because I forgot. I added in some vegetable broth for extra flavor also. I just dumped everything in a dish and stirred in the avocados because I couldn't find the top to my blender. I really liked this as I said but I did make quite a few changes. I liked the consistency however and it was a fairly quick weeknight meal. I'm going to continue to experiment with this because I feel like it has potential!",

The cup of flat parsley does give it that Avocado color green which is why I believe it's there but on the other hand a cup of blended flat parsley leaves turns the whole concoction into more of a pesto-ish pasta dish instead of a cheesy comfort food which is what I was hoping for. I don't think I will make this again but use it as inspiration for a whole new recipe because I love the idea of Avocado Mac and Cheese. Just didn't think this one was what I had in mind.",
