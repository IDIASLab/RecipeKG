Served it to one person who really enjoys pumpkin (myself) and one who doesn't, and both came away really liking it! Has enough flavor that the pumpkin makes itself known, but not so much that it overpowers the alfredo flavor or texture. Recipe makes enough to toss with one cooked 12 oz. box of pasta.",

I would suggest more Parmesan about 1/3 cup. I garnished with the fried sage leaves which was a pretty presentation without being too much sage.",
