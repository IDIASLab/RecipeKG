I changed the mushroom soup to garlic cream of mushroom soup and added some chopped onion to it. I was afraid there wasn't gong to be enough spices but the flavoring on the chips really came through and they stayed crunchy. I had never bought frozen broccolli before and did not care for it to many stems. I prefer the crowns so next time I wil steam some fresh. This was very easy to make and it made alot. Great leftovers. I used a big dutch oven pot instead of the 9x13 so I would have a lid to put on the leftovers. This casserole will be a regular in my house.",
