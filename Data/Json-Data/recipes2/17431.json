Uses few ingredients, prep and cooking time are minimal. The first problem is getting the bird in the first place, if you're a hunter! The second problem is there are NEVER any leftovers, no matter how much you cook. Makes wonderful cold sandwiches IF there is anything leftover!",

I was very weary of the vinegar w/ the milk, and after frying the pheasant I stuck it in a 350 deg oven for 25 min to make sure the pheasant was done, since mine was thicker than the recipe states.  Seasoned with garlic salt, pepper & Johnnys.  My husband said that this was the best \"fried anything\" he'd ever had.  I'm looking forward to doing this again.  ",

I crushed the crackers in my blender and added a few spices to the mix: thyme onion powder garlic powder pepper and some fresh rosemary and basil that I still had left in my garden. I also left the legs and breasts intact. It was so good my family said we should open a new franchise with it: KFP (Kentucky Fried Pheasant)!! They loved it!",
