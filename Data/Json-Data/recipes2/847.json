I got about 3 servings. I used 1 large frozen sliced banana, 1 1\" thick slice of fresh pineapple I had in the freezer. I just cut it in half for easier blending. 1 6oz container of Greek non fat vanilla yogurt (Kroger brand), 3/4 cup of homestyle orange juice, and 8 ice cubes. Will definitely make this again. TY",
