Easy to make, especially because you combine the ingredients in the slow cooker, stir occasionally, and that's it! Seriously addicting! Garnish with real whipped cream or mini marshmallows, if desired. (I prefer my hot chocolate without garnish; it's plenty rich without!)",

It was simple enough to make. I stirred every 15 minutes. p",
