I received endless compliments. I stuck to the recipe except that I doubled the amount of romaine (which substantially increased the volume) added some carrot shreds and made my own balsalmic dressing. To the vinegar I added cumin fresh ginger and seasoning salt and whisked these all with olive oil. After tossing I garnished the salad with edible flowers. The presentation was impressive and would have been as awe-inspiring minus the flowers simply because of the beautiful array of fruit colors. I cannot wait to make this salad again when I have the crowd to serve it to or the special occasion on which to share this delicious salad.",
