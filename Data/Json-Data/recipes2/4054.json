It was just okay for me. I normally enjoy pumpkin flavored desserts, but I didn't like it so much this time. The pumpkin flavor was a bit too overbearing with each bite. However, I loved everything else about it. I thought it was light and fluffy. I also enjoyed that they weren't too sweet. \n\nBecause I liked everything else about the recipe except for the pumpkin, I used sweet potatoes the second time around. They were heavenly! So, if the pumpkin doesn't workout for you, give sweet potatoes a try. \n\nI want to add that the batter is a little thick, so it is important that the temperature of the oil is just right and that the portions for each ball is kept at about a tablespoon or smaller. Otherwise, they will be gooey in the middle, and/or burned on the outside... Not that that happened to me... I'm just saying, you know, just in case.",

The first time I didn't leave them in the oil for the allotted time, taking them out when the outsides looked done. Big mistake. They were not done in the center. Second and third batches I followed the instructions and they turned out great. They are crispy on the outside and velvety on the inside.

Jack-o-lantern types don't have great flavor, and even store-bought sugar pie pumpkins aren't as good as some other varieties. Home-grown and locally grown pumpkins that have been allowed to ripen on the vine are the best! I made these with pureed, oven-roasted pumpkin from a Cinderella blue I got from a local farm, and they came out fantastic (as did the pie I made with it). The oil temperature has to be just right - too low and they take forever, too hot and the outsides burn while the insides are still dough. I did mine in a pan on the stove on slightly over medium heat (after some trial and error) and they came out perfect! Crispy outsides, light and silky insides. Next time I might increase the spices just a tad, but the pumpkin flavor was just right. We rolled them all in cinnamon sugar, cause we love it, and the whole family just gobbled them up! Can't wait to make them again! Also, as a note, I combined everything except the flour and baking powder the night before and kept it in the fridge, and the next morning, followed directions as written. It really saved a lot of time.",
