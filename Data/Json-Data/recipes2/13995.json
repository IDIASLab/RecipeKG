The recipe indicates that it makes 4 glasses but I just finished drinking it by myself in two glasses. 4 glasses would mean tiny servings. And FYI 4 jiggers is equivalent to 6 ounces just in case you were wondering! So you could just guestimate and put in a little less than a cup (8 oz) of the amaretto and milk. This is truly a delicious recipe and would make a nice party drink. In my opinion the alcohol was not strong at all and I am not a big alcohol drinker so I think you can take my word for it.:)",
