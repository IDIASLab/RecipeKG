Microwaving the coleslaw mix prior to combining with the other ingredients creates a more compact filling and a full egg roll. Sometimes, I use about 1/2 cup of cooked sausage or ham instead of the shrimp. I always make a mixture of about 1 Tablespoon of flour mixed with 1 Tablespoon of water to seal the top corner of the Nasoya wrappers. I place four or five of the egg rolls in my deep fryer at 375 degrees for about 3 minutes. They fry to a nice golden color - so crispy and delicious!

I added an onion and a green pepper to the cabbage before nuking. Once out of the microwave I added a small handful of finely chopped mushrooms and some minced ginger and left out the shrimp. I used only half the black pepper called for and still found it to be too much for my taste (and DS could not finish his). I convect baked at 425 for 10 minutes flipped and went another 10 minutes and they were perfectly done (not as good as deep frying to be sure but I wasn't in the mood to haul out the fryer).

I made these with rice wrappers instead of wheat flour wrappers to keep it gluten free. I also had to make them without shrimp so I used some left over chicken breast that I had shredded. I actually made them a couple of times because the first batch I left out the salt. I figured that the soy had enough sodium (actually I used tamari-gluten free soy sauce). I was wrong don't forget the salt!! The cabbage and carrot became sweet during the cooking process and the lack of salt made them too sweet. The second time I made them I added salt and this seemed to balance it out properly. Definitely these will become our go to egg rolls being easy and quick to make and scrumptious. They work in a 220 C oven instead of frying so there's a plus. Thanks What's For Dinner Mom for this recipe. It has helped me get my Chinese food back!",

I used chicken rather than shrimp and made them mini egg rolls rather than full size using one wrapper per egg roll with 1/4 cup filling. The mixture made 24 minis. We fried six for dinner and I flash froze 18 of them uncooked. This was so easy to make and microwaving the slaw mixture is pretty cleaver. We dipped them in a Sweet & Spicy Thai Sauce to give them the heat we like. Paired them with 'Quick Pork Fried Rice' from AR and we enjoyed a delicious dinner!
