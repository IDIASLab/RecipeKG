I am on a slow carb diet and these are a perfect addition to it.  Yum!  One note of caution, only cook the beans the 3 minutes before adding the arugula other wise they will start to mash while waiting for the arugula to wilt. The bacon I bought had 12 slices which I also cut up and put into 2 additional plastic bags for more meals.",
