Just adding salt and pepper would be a step in the right direction but bolder use of your preferred seasoning(s) will make a remarkable difference in flavor. We used fresh broccoli cauliflower and carrots not frozen. The appearance and taste of this dish would be improved if the vegetables were first combined with the cream sauce before placing in a baking dish (used a 9\" x 13\" since no size is suggested). Pouring the sauce over the top of the veggies as instructed results in veggies being unevenly coated with those at top heavily sauced and those at bottom with little or no sauce. The directions are unclear as to whether the cracker crumbs are spread over the cream sauce or the vegetables... doesn t make much difference if made as written as the veggies and sauce need to be stirred-up anyway.",

As long as you stick to the roots (mayo sour cream buttery crackers) then the vegetables you use are negligible. I always make it with fresh veggies. I like to roast eggplant and zucchini with olive oil and italian seasoning saut\u00e9 onions mushrooms and garlic chop up a tomato and add shredded chicken. These variations are still full of calories but they get the vegetable nutrients in as well and everyone in my house LOVES it!",
