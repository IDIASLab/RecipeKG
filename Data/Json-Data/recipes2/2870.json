I adjusted the serving size to 5 servings because pecans are so expensive up here and I wanted to try the recipe out before making a giant batch. I thought that the flavour of old cheddar cheese might be more apparent, but it wasn't. I make my own jalape\u00f1o pepper jelly so I used that instead of buying a jar of raspberry jalape\u00f1o jelly. I found that the taste improved after it sat in the fridge for 24 hours, but I wasn't compelled to eat it all up. Maybe if the cheese was doubled, or replaced with a very sharp cheddar, it might have a fuller flavour.",

Green onions seemed overwhelming with other ingredients so I used chives...much better for a hint of flavor. I didn't have raspberry jalapeno jam so I substituted with black berry jam with a dash of chipotle powder and drop of Tabasco Chipotle hot sauce. For those that don't want any burn try ground sumac. This is a definite keeper as it is an unusual appetizer.",
