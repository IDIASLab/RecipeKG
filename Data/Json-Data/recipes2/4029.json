I used 1/2 Becel and 1/2 butter as I didn't have the full amount 1/2 all purpose and 1/2 Robin Hood Omega 3 Whole Wheat and Flax flour added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice and bumped the vanilla up to 1 tbsp. I used my large cookie scoop that made 24 cookies which baked in 18 minutes. I used 2 Empire apples which I would dice finer if making smaller cookies I also blotted them dry before adding. I skipped the drizzle as I had no white chips I think cinnamon chips would be a good addition. The second time I made them with a loosely packed cup of cut up dried apples used scant 2 cups of flour #50 scoop yielded 40 cookies which baked in 10 to 11 minutes. My cookies never flattened out I used a fork when I turned the trays halfway through baking.",
