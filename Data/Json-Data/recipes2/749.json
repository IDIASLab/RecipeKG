Maybe, I had the unfortunate experience of growing up too much on the bottled stuff. The prep for this recipe is very easy, even the bbq sauce. I only had a package of 6 chicken legs, so I halved the recipe to try it. I also cut the sauce cooking time in half. The chicken takes considerably longer than the 1 minute suggested. I recently had bbq'd chicken legs at a party, which made me choose this recipe. I would definitely consider something like this, to attempt again, to feed a group for a bbq along with other meats. It's very affordable to make and there is much more meat than typical chicken wings. ty",

First, I doubled the spice rub, (something I highly suggest) to make it more flavorful. I cut the cook time for the sauce down a little bit because it had started to burn. My biggest problem was the complicated cooking over indirect heat. After cooking the chicken as long as I could without burning it, I realized that it still wasn't cooked in the center. I ended up putting it in the microwave to make it safe for consumption! If I were to make it again, (which I don't think I will), I will probably cook it the way I would normally, basting along the way!",

My changes are: I had three packs of chicken that would have gone bad it not used asap, so I tripled the recipe and hoped for the best. I started too late to marinade for the stated 9+ hours, so I made the paste, and marinaded for ~2 1/2 hours ( it turned out great, but I'm sure 9 hours gives more flavor.) Then I made the sauce, we have some heat loving people in our family and it seemed as though it might be a little too sweet, so into the sauce I added ~ 1 tea cayenne pepper, and some hot sauce. I followed the advice of some other reviewers, and do agree that the chicken could be browned for a lot longer than one minute. I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans...Yum!",

Now that I've done it once I know I need to turn my grill up a bit higher next time. That's not why 4 stars though; it was good but I usually give 5 stars to recipes that absolutely amaze me.
