It is fine if you like to use the recipe for a pancake, but originally you had them for brunch with cups of tea or coffee. Kids love them at birthday parties. Spread the pikelets with jam and put on top a big dollop of whipped cream.",

I was really surprised at how much flavor these had with all the more ingredients.  I made two batches in the time it would have taken to make one batch of my hubby's pancakes.  I think they are lighter than pancakes so in that I differ from other reviewers.  This is a definite keeper.  Quick and easy homestyle breakfast that can be whipped up in a snap!  Thanks so much!",
