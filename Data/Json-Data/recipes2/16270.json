As others have said it was a bit dry but I served it under another Allrecipes dish that helped out with that: Garlic Chicken (by Martha Banks - a Taste of Home Recipe). The Garlic Chicken has a great sauce that went PERFECTLY with this pasta and gave it just the right amount of moisture. The pasta alone I'd give 4.5 stars but in combination with the chicken 5 stars! Absolutely wonderful! So healthy and serves WAY more than 2 (I'll probably get 3-4 large portions out of it).",

I followed the recipe as listed except we had a big jar of sundried tomatoes in olive oil so I skipped the step of sauteeing them in oil and just the tomatoes right from the jar. We sprinkled some parmegano reggiano cheese on top. My husband really liked it. I thought it was a little bland so I added some extra salt and red pepper flakes to my serving.",
