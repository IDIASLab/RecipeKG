The last time I prepared it with a simple flour and black pepper and seasoning salt dry dredged in a zip lock bag and it came out wonderful light and crispy and crunchy. Make sure to get some pepper vinegar to dip the tripe pieces into. It makes all the difference in the world. \nAlso be sure to boil the tripe two or three times for an hour or so to try and cook off as much of the fat as you can!",
