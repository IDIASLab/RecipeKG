Instead of the onion soup I used coriander nutmeg garlic powder salt pepper parsley and onion flakes to season the meat. When had been in the oven for 20 minutes I poured over a sauce made of a can of cream of chicken soup 1 1/4 cups light sour cream 1/2-3/4 cup milk 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 1/3 cup white wine a sprinkle of salt and a sprinkle of parsley. Baked them for 20 more minutes. The sauce was great over the meatballs! Also what worked best for me when making the meatballs was to just make the 2 sides shaped like rounded triangles put them together and seal the edges and then form it into a heart shape. Oh and for some reason I could only fit about a tablespoon and a half of the filling into each one I'll try to do more next time. A chunk of cheese and some mushroom slices might be easier to handle.",
