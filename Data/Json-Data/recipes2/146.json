The only exception was that I do not have recourse to a \"real live butcher,\" and used coarsely ground pork from the case. It was good... but the flavor was more similar to Italian sausage than traditional breakfast sausage. Too much fennel? Not enough sage and black pepper? I'm not sure. I'm planning to tweak the seasonings in the future.",
