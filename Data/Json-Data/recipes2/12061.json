It was my first time trying tofu in a smoothie and I think this recipe has a great ratio of tofu to milk and pumpkin puree. I would just drastically reduce the amount of cinnamon. I added slightly less than a tablespoon of cinnamon and slightly less than 1/2 a teaspoon of nutmeg because I was worried that they would be too strong and they still were so overpowering they made the smoothie taste almost bitter. I will try this again with just 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.",
