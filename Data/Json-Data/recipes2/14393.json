A very simple tasty unique recipe but I would recommend the following: (1) Although the receipe indicates \"6 servings\" one and one half pounds of ribs with the bone in is really \"2 servings\". Adjust accordingly. (2) The sauce is fabulous but the original recipe just doesn't give you enough. I would triple the amounts listed so you have plenty of sauce to serve over the ribs. It's no problem the ingredients are simple and cheap. (3) The sauce will burn easily so if you like to grill the ribs like I do over medium-high heat baste the ribs only during the last 5 minutes of grilling.",
