I used raisins and walnuts in the crust and baked it in a 9-inch springform for 12 minutes. In the filling I used plain Greek yogurt that I added a little honey and vanilla extract to. I would recommend creaming the cream cheese until it's completely smooth before adding in the yogurt (to avoid lumps). I also omitted the stevia since I added honey to the yogurt. I topped it with strawberries oranges bananas kiwis and blueberries. This tastes kind of cheesecake like; so it's like you're eating something really bad for you but it's actually pretty good for you! I love it thank you!",
