My only word of caution is with the amount of water to the amount of rice: 3 cups of water to 2 cups of brown rice makes for crunchy, not-fully-cooked rice. I needed 4 cups water, which is fairly normal for brown rice. So I would cook the rice with the amount of liquid listened on the package instead of the amount listed here. I did like this more after adding an additional sprinkle of lime juice and chili powder at the end--it just brightened up the flavor a bit. But for what this is, it's delicious, and a nice, easy meal--that's really inexpensive to make too. Will definitely make again. Thank you!",
