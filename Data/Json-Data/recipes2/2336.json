I can see how some would be put off by the saltiness of the soy sauce even though it's reduced sodium. I added a touch of sugar to even out the flavor. I would add a dash or two of sugar and then taste test. I halved the recipe and it turned out wonderful.  There's something addictive about this sauce!",
