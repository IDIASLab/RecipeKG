I should have known when you spelled slyders with an \"i\". My husband describes this meal like a Rueben sandwich without the Rueben. The sandwich is just slightly runny after nuking it. The taste is nowhere near being even slightly close. My mother-in-law made wonderful \"mock slyders\" but they were made from ground beef and cooked in the oven amidst tons of shredded onions. I will have to dig up her old recipe and add it to this site. But I can definitely thank you because this recipe has now put my worst ever prepared \"married\" dinner in second place.",

This was working good for me until I added the sour cream and then everything started to curd up and stick to the skillet. The taste was alright but it wasn't very appetizing to look at. I ended up browning it as good as I could to get that crunch on it and that made a huge difference. You definitely do not need an entire jar of pickles. In fact it you chop them up as I did it helps distribute them throughout the sandwich.",
