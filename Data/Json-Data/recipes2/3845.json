However, WARNING:  475 degree oven is way too high and 20-25 minutes too long for that high a temperature. When I went to flip the broccolini after 10 minutes it was already on the verge of burning.  Next time I will try 425 degree oven for 15-20 minutes and continue to adjust until I can find the right temperature and time.  I think it is worth the effort. KEEP AN EYE ON IT!",

I tweaked it just slightly by keeping the broccolini whole and tossed it with a little oil salt & pepper pepper flakes and minced garlic. Put it in the oven for about 15 minutes. I think the 20 - 25 minutes per the directions would have made them mushy and I prefer mine to be more crispy. Squeezed a little lemon over it when done and topped with shredded Parmesan. Yum! Will definitely make these again!",
