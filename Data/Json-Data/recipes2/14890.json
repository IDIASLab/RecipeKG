I think it could make any pretzel taste great!! Maybe it was the beer I used but next time I won't use the garlic powder...I didn't think it was neccessary b/c the combo of cheese(s) and beer was good enough!! The cheese makes ALOT!!! Will be making this for many parties and events to come!! Thanks Doreen!!(PS-next time I'll try and find that dough referred to by the submitter. I tried to find it in my grocery store but couldn't..thus I made my own pretzels. Anyone know a good brand I should try?)",
