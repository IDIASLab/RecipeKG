The last few minutes of cooking I threw in a can of diced tomatoes (drained). Once it was done I sliced the chicken breast and added that along with some reduced fat cheddar cheese.

The Adobo seasoning is very much in taste to me like a mix between garlic powder and garlic salt. I will definitely use it in other recipes. Using both items made for a very quick meal with seasoning built right in. I liked how this recipe also incorporated fresh tomatoes a green pepper and onion. The only thing is I really liked the chicken and rice before adding the cheese. It tasted more authentic to me and I am actually surprised I made a chicken and rice dish that looked like it took more time than it actually did to make. Possibly the cheese makes it more kid friendly though. The second thing is it was a little more salty than I normally make food. However the Adobo seasoning amount says season to taste and I may have just went too heavy handed on that. Either way TY Goya for the quick and easy meal idea to get dinner on the table this week.",
