Mix the cream cheese and sour cream together add 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. Mix all this. Then add your grapes, fold the grapes into cream cheese mixture. transfer this mixture into your serving dish. Before you go to serve the salad top it with 1/3 cup of brown sugar, sprinkle it on top of grape salad. You can then top it with almonds or I use pecans. this is the best recipe! It is a very refreshing snack or dessert! even my children love it!! You'll be glad you made this one!!",

We aren't fans of anything w/nuts but I had to try it & oh my!! I happened to use pecans & it was incredible-nuts in this are a must! I thought it looked great too(not sure why others didn't so). As soon as I set it on the table everyone ooohed & ahhhed. I may add a little whipped cream next time just to thin it out a bit because it is sticky & thick. Oh-I weighed out my grapes AFTER pulling stems picking thru & rinsing & seemed to be a perfect ratio of ingredienst. If anything maybe could've added a few more grapes. Thank you for a great recipe!! UPDATE: If you're not serving imediately take along some whipped cream to stir in just before serving. Once it sits awhile it does get kind of ugly:) The whipped cream brings it back to life & it should last throughout the meal even on a buffet line.",
