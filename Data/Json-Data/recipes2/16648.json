Using honey instead of molasses (I feel molasses is far too strong for this), adding a touch of garlic, reducing the amount of peanut oil and am using an asian stirfry frozen veggie mix with soybeans in it to make this a main dish served over brown rice. I am not sure exactly how it will turn out, but having made similar things before, it sounds like a hit. I love using the mandarin oranges as part of the sauce as I don't usually keep orange juice on hand but those I do...this makes it an easy, easy dish to whip up.",
