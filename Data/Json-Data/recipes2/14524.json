I think 15 seconds in the microwave as stated by other reviewers is the key, because I put it in for 30-35 by mistake and my banana started melting. I will not do the 'open end' roll up from now on, as the honey turns to complete liquid after microwaving, so I will wrap this like a burrito from now on, and prevent the drippies of the goodness! I tried packaging it in the evening but the honey melts out and gets the tortilla gross, not sure what to do about that.  Even making it in the morning and saran wrapping it, it's mushy by the time I get in to work.  Could also be because I cut the banana in half.  Either way, I loved this recipe and I'm dying to try other things people suggested like Nutella and cinnamon.  Added a sprinkle of wheat germ which adds a nice texture and is a great way to hide something healthy for kids.",

I used whole bananas spread the honey on along w/ the peanut butter & they nixed the idea of raisins so I used some mini-chocolate chips instead. I also copied Josie & microwaved for 15 seconds....yumosoblamo! (don't ask me...it's just what my eldest grandson said after taking a bite LOL) I had to steal a bite from them so I could leave an accurate review & it was so tasty that I made one up for myself. They were really messy (thanks for the heads up!) but we ate them out on the patio & had baby wipes ready til I could get them into the kitchen sink to wash up. Will make again many many times...thanks!",
