I live in Canada we don't have chili beans I used 1 can each no salt kidney and black beans rinsed and drained and 16 oz homemade baked beans in tomato sauce. I added 1/2 a green pepper and 3 stalks of celery that I had that needed to be used up. The tomatoes I had were fire roasted. For seasoning I used 2 tbsps chili powder 1 tsp each garlic powder onion powder and cumin and 1/4 tsp each salt and pepper. I only needed about half the tomato paste and added about 1/2 cup of water to make it a bit saucier but it was still nice and thick. I chose this recipe because my son doesn't like really tomato-ey chili or chili that has \"weird\" stuff in it. I made this for the April Allrecipes Allstars Canada challenge #ARFaceless",
