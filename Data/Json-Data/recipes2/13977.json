If I had told hubby there were olives in it -- he probably would have turned up his nose. I didn't have mushrooms to add and I used the smoked sausage I had on hand. I threw in a pinch of summer savory and shake or two of seasoned salt. I also added about half an onion - diced - to the sausage as I saut\u00e9ed it. But I don't think any of my minor alterations changed the dish much. For a casserole this is unique in that it is not heavy on a sauce or gravy so the subtle flavors really sparkle.",

The black olives added to the texture & presentation, but not much flavor.We doubled the recipe & added more rice then called for, so I thought it was i bit dry when I was mixing it, so I popped open a small can of V-8 juice & added that. Just enough moisture! Fit nicely in a 13x9 pan.",
