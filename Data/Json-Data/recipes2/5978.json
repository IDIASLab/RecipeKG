I liked that they were simmered in beer which gave the beans a nice flavor. I cut back on the beer as suggested by another reviewer but I ended up adding in the full amount. I let them simmer over low heat uncovered and they thickened up nicely. When ready to serve I drizzled them with a bit of jalapeno olive oil for an extra kick. These beans would be really good with cumin chili powder or chipotle powder added or even cooked with some diced jalape\u00f1o. I will be making these again with some variations here and there.",
