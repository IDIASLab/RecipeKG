This is a new family favorite for sure! Edit: My hubby and I still love this recipe but I've made some modifications so it's quicker to make. I've still not made the sauce because the chicken by itself is so good. What I do now is dice the chicken and cook in a pan with a little bit of oil. Then I sprinkle on cooked crumbled bacon the chopped jalapenos (I use jarred) and the shredded cheese. Put the lid on and let it cook till the cheese melts. It takes a fraction of the time but still tastes delicious!",

I told the boys to add some chicken broth and not use the doubled amount of flour it would be too much. They ended up ony needing a few TBS of flour.They also put the chicken under the broiler to crisp up the bacon. The first thing my husband said was \"This is GOOD\" after a few more bites he said it was the best chicken he ever had. He took the jalapenos out but liked the flavor they left behind.
