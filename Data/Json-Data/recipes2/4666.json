Gives this recipe that little extra ommph! I was skeptical of using chocolate milk but the flavor is so mild against the Nutella you almost don't even need it. Served with 'real' maple syrup (not the imitation heavy imposter stuff) and pecans for a wonderful breakfast! Thank you Nico!",

Presentation is kinda messy and the Nutella is overpowering. Not wanting to throw away all of it I ate my portion and then instantly regretted it. Way too rich and an instant stomach ache. I also felt cooking it in butter was unnecessary and i could have just used Pam. Luckily this recipe doesn't make a large amount so not a huge loss. I feel like just a good french toast recipe with fresh sliced bananas and a drizzle of Nutella on top would be much more delicious and less heavy.",
