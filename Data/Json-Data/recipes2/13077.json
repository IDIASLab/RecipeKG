I think either there needs to be more seasoning or a flavorful sauce paired with it. I would make this again but with some tweaks. I would add some cyan salt or seasoned salt maybe a little garlic or lemon juice. With that said the outside turned out nice and crispy creating a wonderful crunch while the inside was moist and tender. Adding the salmon juice was a fantastic idea.",
