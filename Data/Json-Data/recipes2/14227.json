After the chicken is done saute sliced onion and green bell pepper in the clarified butter until onions change color to a light golden brown. Serve chicken with the sauted veggies rolled in warmed pita bread. Accompany this with some plain or spiced yogurt on the side and you have great meal. I went back and changed my ratings from 4 to 5 stars as this dish gets better everytime I make it. The last time I made it I served it with some hummus on the side and a green salad. Thanks for this easy yet outstanding recipe.",
