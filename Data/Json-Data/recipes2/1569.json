It's also easily customizable; I used ham in place of sausage and 8 eggs in place of Egg Beaters (R).  I think some onion would be a nice addition, too.  It won't become my go to breakfast casserole, but we both enjoyed it.  THANKS for the recipe, PAM.",

I don't care for pre-cooked sausage personally so I used 4 maple turkey sausages I cooked from the day before. I also used sharp cheddar since there is so little in the recipe to up the cheese flavor. I had one small red pepper so that is what I used and I chopped it very small. That all worked great. I actually like a more crisp hash brown in an egg casserole but this worked fine for ease. I lined an 8x8 pan with 2 layers of foil and sprayed with PAM. As usual it made for extremely easy clean-up. What is so great about this recipe though is cut into 8 squares it is 115 calories a serving. That is great for a breakfast dish. ty",

I didn't have enough potatoes (thought I had another bag in the freezer!) so I shredded some fresh ones to make up the two cups (rinsed all the starch off before throwing in the egg mix). I used 2% milk and a mix of sea salt and garlic powder. Only other change I made to the ingredients was to use chicken sausages that I had leftover. My square glass pan broke :( so I used a Pyrex pie plate, came out perfect, I got six servings out of it but served with bagels, fruit salad and yogurt. DBF had seconds, rare for him when we have breakfast for dinner. I think they make hash browns in 2 cup bags; that would make this super easy to throw together on a busy night or weekend morning.
