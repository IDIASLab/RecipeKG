When he asked for it today I dug out the recipe, added it to my recipe notebook (only recipes I will prepare again and again make it in), and decided I should add my review.    I prepared the clams as per the recipe.  At the end I sprinkled it with lots of green onions sliced in long, diagonal slices just to pretty it up.    This one is a keeper - easy to prepare and delicious.  Many thanks to Lilibeth for the recipe. ",
