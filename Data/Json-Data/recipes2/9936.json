You can mix up the ingredients a hundred different ways. The recipe for me was different, because I used what I had, and I did not have broccoli. My husband RAVED over this and my 9 and 10-year-old loved it. (Although, my 9-year-old picked out all the shrimp, which was to my husband\u2019s delight, because she gave her shrimp to him!) I wish I would have gotten a photo, because it was a beautiful dish, but I didn\u2019t think to. \nBaked Shrimp Alfredo: (6 servings)\n\nMeat: 1.5 pounds of Shrimp: raw, peeled, deveined, no tails (I wish I had a couple slices of bacon on hand to add, but I did not.) \n\nPasta: Half a package of Gluten Free spaghetti (GF did great in this recipe!)\n\nVeggies: 3 zucchini, 1 orange bell pepper, 1 red bell pepper, slice or dice according to your preferences\n\nSauce: 1 jar of Alfredo Sauce, half a cup of milk, half a stick of butter\nSpices: 1 T of salt, 1 T of ground rosemary, 1 T of smoked paprika, 1 T of ground bay leaves (basil), 1 T of black pepper, 2 t of cayenne pepper, 2 t of chili powder\n\nTopping: 8 ounces of shredded cheese (I had a Mexican blend and it was delicious) \n\n1)\tGrease 8 x 10 by pouring \u00bd stick of butter in bottom of pan\n2)\tPre-Heat oven to 400 degrees\n3)\tBoil water: stir in spaghetti once it\u2019s reached a rapid boil, boil spaghetti for 4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally\n4)\tPut shrimp in pan o",
