I used walnuts and peanut butter chips because that's what I had in the pantry.  I also only had a half of a can of sweetened condensed milk, which worked perfectly.  These were devoured by my nieces and nephews at a birthday party - they even unintentionally outshined the birthday cake!  Two suggestions: line your pan with parchment paper so the bars will come out easily, and do not overbake!  Crusts on these types of bars burn quickly.",

                "reviewBody": "very rich! but extremely easy, no mess and no fuss.  I used a butter recipe yellow cake mix, and melted the butter to go into the crust.  Paula Dean makes a similar crust for her \"gooey toffee bars\" from her show and she melts hers.  Very easy to pat the dough into the pan, with the butter melted it doesn't stick to your fingers.  I didn't have pecans so used 1 cup of the scotch chips and 1 cup chocolate chips.  I used the same bowl (without washing) to make the condensed milk topping.  They taste somewhat like a butterscotch brownie but are much richer.  The 9x13 pan was perfect and sprayed with Pam.  It didn't stick to the bottom.  A word of caution as with any other recipe that includes condensed milk, don't overcook as the sides will be hard.  This baked in my oven for 27 minutes.  This is a very fast easy dessert and would be nice for bake sales, parties, or any other time one would want a fast simple dessert but with the richness.  The possibilities are endless here as far as modifications.  Any flavor cake mix and chip/nut combo would work.  (spice mix with cinnamon chips, chocolate mix with white chocolate chips...etc.)  They cut into nice squares once cooled.",
