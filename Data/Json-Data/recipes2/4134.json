This is my first time making, or even tasting, chili verde.   It's also my first time using fresh tomatillos and pablonos.     Having said that, I love this recipe.   It's easy to make and it tastes so fresh and has just a bit of a bite.   I love the suggestion of using pickled red onions on top.   The meal does not need them and is exceptional on its own, but they add another level.   The onions are also great just on their own.   My blender probably isn't on par with the one that Chef John uses, because I had to blend for a much longer time to make this creamy.   Otherwise it was a bit grainy.    So make sure you have it very blended before adding it to the meat.   Also, my potatoes took significantly longer to become tender than what the recipe states.    I like this recipe just as written.   Thank you CJ for another fantastic recipe.",

I used pork chops rather than pork shoulder and Hatch green chilies instead of a poblano since they are in season. I roasted all of the veggies including an onion as others suggested. We made sopes ( corn masa type crust that is grilled on a flat top and then edges pinched to form a rim and then it is fried so it is crispy) and put the chili verde on top. This is as good or better than any restaurant. This is a keeper recipe. I froze the leftovers because my husband will not eat leftovers --- this will be a quick meal next time we eat it.",
