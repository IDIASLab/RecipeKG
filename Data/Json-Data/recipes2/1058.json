This recipe does make a very large bowl and it was good without getting watery for about 3 days.  Just make sure you drain your fruit really well.  I saved the juice from the fruit and used it to make gelatin.  A delicious salad that will grace my table again.",

One of my sisters uses vanilla pudding (straight out the box) instead of cool whip, yogurt or sour cream. Best when refrigerated at least 24 hours.",
