You get a rounded top with a flat bottom. (Perfect for portion control). I put the ground nuts in a small deep bowl and dropped the dough balls into it. You can do about four at a time. Just shake the bowl in a circular motion. The dough rounds itself out and coats each one. It really speeds up the process. I gave these as gifts as got rave reviews.",
