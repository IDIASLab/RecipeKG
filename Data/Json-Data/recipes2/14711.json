It almost looked like a funky salsa or something but I would serve it again at my own home so that I could explain what it was and I think it would go over better. I made this again for a smaller get together and it was gone before anything else.....I loved it and when I could tell people what it was they really enjoyed....",

I then added one 8 oz pkg of cream cheese, softened, 3/4 c. mont. jack cheese, 3 cloves garlic, 1/4 c. grated parmesan cheese, 1 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper,  1 c. mayo and 1 Tbsp dried minced onion. I tossed all of this in the food processor and ground the heck out of it.  Threw it in the oven for 20 minutes @ 350.  Served with Pita Chips (recipe from this site) and an assortment of fresh veggies.  My guests could not get enough, and had to force themselves to stop eating, so as to have room for dinner!  Even my picky picky 9 year old gobbled it up, and has requested we have it again tonight.  The artichokes really set this apart, and it's just such a pretty dish to set on the table.",
