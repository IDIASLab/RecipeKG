It was created by bartender Eddie Woelke an American who left to set up shop in Havana Cuba. Woelke also invented the drink 'El Presidente'. Mary Pickford actually had other cocktails named after her. One is the still well known cocktail the 'Bloody Mary' which is thought to have been created by bartender Fernand Petiot of The St Regents Hotel in New York. Two all but forgotten cocktails are 'Romana' and ' Rosita' named after film characters that Mary Pickford played.",
