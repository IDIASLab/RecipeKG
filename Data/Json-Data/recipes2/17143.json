The one drawback here is the directions on this one are really confusing! I think that's why so many of the reviewers had trouble with them and ended up adding eggs and bread crumbs to the mixture to hold the burgers together which is not what the submitter intended. I had one pound of ground beef (wasn't able to scale the recipe back) so here's what I did: I used 2 Tbsp. of A1, 1 & 1/2 tsp. of horseradish sauce, 1 tsp. parsley, 1 Tbsp. green onion, and 1 tsp. of Montreal Steak seasoning for good measure. Once the patties were made (got 3) I let them set in the fridge for an hour to let the flavors blend together. We put them on the grill and basted them with some additional A1 as the recipe states and man did these smell good! They held together just fine. We topped them with the Muenster cheese and a horseradish sauce that I made: light mayo, horseradish, dijon mustard, a squirt of lemon juice, and some crumbled bacon bits.  I think my husband was in A1 heaven!",
