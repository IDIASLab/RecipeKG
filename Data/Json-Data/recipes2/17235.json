I did not have to use buckshot to get my duck since I had a lot of ducks already in the pen thinking they were going to get some sour mash. I chose the fat duck which would have been greasy but I poked it full of holes first and set it upon celery stalks which kept it out of it's own grease. Very good duck and we all liked it.",

We also didn't keep the innards because we do not like them so I completely skipped this step. Hard to give an accurate review since my bird was not what the recipe called for but I do think the combo of flavors and the sazon was good for the duck. Thank you!",
