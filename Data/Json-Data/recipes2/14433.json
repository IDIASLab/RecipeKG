I mostly us banana creme and french vanilla pudding, I do not let it set as the recipe calls for. I buy one extra creamy whip cream and one regular. I mix the regular one in with my pudding mixture and use the extra creamy one for the top layer. Also, I started using mini wafers instead of the larger ones because the mixture preads easier. \nSo, I lay down a thick layer of mini wafers. Pile on half the pudding mixture, spread out bananas, pile on the rest of mixture and spread a thin layer of extra creamy whip cream over the top. Sprinkle with left over crushed wafers. I find that this way calls for more bananas and a slighlty deeper pan than the regular 8x11. Not sure if my way is better or worse, everyone devours it either way I make it. Thanks again for a great recipe! ~Tamara  ",
