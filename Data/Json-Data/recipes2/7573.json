Very bland and the ramen were absorbed to the point that you didn't even see them. I followed exactly how to make them and they vanished. Weird. That probably took away from taste as well. Would make my way again minus the ramen and I would not blend eggs in blender with cheese (I used Borsin) I would just whip eggs by fork and add in dollops of the Borsin.",

Next time I am going to add more of the cheese spread and maybe a little cheddar cheese. I am also going to precook some sausage or ham and toss it in. I mean you can do anything to this recipe. Make it once as is and then experiment with it. I do recommend more garlic cheese spread and I used real ramen Noodles not the kind that come with flavor packets. I didn t break up the noodles because it was too messy. My family ate spinach. So it s a winner for me.",
