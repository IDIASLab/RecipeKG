                "reviewBody": "Holy pasta salad Batman! This makes a TON of pasta salad (I'm already making a mental list of dinner invitees so it doesn't go to waste!). If you're making this for a family dinner you'll probably want to halve it. I made as is though I did use only 24 oz of pasta as I realized my boxes were 12 oz as opposed to 16. I also bought broccoli crowns (I'm lazy) instead of 2 heads (I used 3 largish crowns instead). I also reduced the mayo a bit (and I always use light mayo w/EVOO) to lighten it up a bit. Surprisingly there was only ONE bottle of red wine vinaigrette in all of my grocery stores bottled dressings (I'll make my own if I make this again but wanted to stay true to the recipe this time). This is a nice change of pace pasta salad and I really like the amount of veggies in it (I also added a bag of shredded carrots to add some more color/nutrients). While it won't become my \"go to\" pasta salad I'm definately glad I tried it! I'm looking forward to customizing it a bit; I think I'll add some chopped banana peppers (w/juice) and a handful or two of shredded cheddar too. THANKS for a very nice recipe Hope!",
