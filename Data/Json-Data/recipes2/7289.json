I always loved mayo with cranberry sauce on sandwiches but combining the two and adding poppy seeds makes such a difference. We ate this for days on our sandwiches and I could see using this with chicken also. I made a half batch using Hellmann's mayo and a half batch with Miracle Whip we loved both! I can't wait to use this for a chicken salad or turkey salad adding in some diced celery and onion. Thanks for sharing this wonderful easy spread:)",
