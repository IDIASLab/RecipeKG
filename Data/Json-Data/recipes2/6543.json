Check out this version - Lightly steamed broccoli rabe combined with portobello heads - niiiiiice. This recipe yields wonderful broccoli rabe in oil, combined with delicious portobellos, but since the broccoli is cooked separately it is not so heavy with oil. Really nice. Still use plenty of garlic though!!!!",

To temper its bitterness I added some chopped red bell pepper which introduced some nice color too.  For a little kick I added a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes.  Use olive oil as needed; I'm sure it was difficult for the submitter to come up with a precise, one-size-fits-all amount when he wrote the recipe.  I served this topped with beautiful seared dry-pack scallops.",
