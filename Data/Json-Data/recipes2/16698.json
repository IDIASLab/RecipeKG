This recipe was much better than I imagined it would be--my husband loved it too.  I made delicious homemade style biscuits to go with it and eating pieces of biscuit mixed in with this meal reminded me of a chicken pot pie.  The only thing I would mention is that it is not 4 large servings.  It was fine for my family because my two children are preschool age and don't eat a lot.  I imagine if you have four very hungry adults, you may want to increase the ingredients.",

After I arranged the frozen veggies on top as the recipe suggested, I had to simmer longer than five minutes in order for them to become tender.  As a result, it scorched.  Rather than arranging them on top, I think it would be better to stir them in and keep stirring occaisionally through the end of the cooking process.  It would probably be a good idea to thaw the veggies first.  I skimmed the good stuff off the top and salvaged most of the meal.  Overall, I found it a little bland, but salt and more spices will fix that.  Also, next time I will omit the potatoes and use noodles.",
