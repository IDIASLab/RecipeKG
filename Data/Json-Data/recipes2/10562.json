I cooked whole bacon slices in the oven to keep from having to wash a skillet (cleaned the kitchen this morning), and then just crumbled the bacon.   Granted, the avocado does lend itself to a really creamy texture, but the the egg\u2019s flavor seems flat/bland.  I added an extra squeeze of lime juice, but the bacon is about all that I could taste.  I have to wonder if a little bit of vinegar might brighten or enhance the flavor a bit.  It was OK, but I think I\u2019m tossing in the towel on bacon-avocado deviled eggs.  This totally could be just a personal taste preference, so I don\u2019t want to discourage others from trying.",
