I think the Cilantro made ALL the difference. Sas very good and will definitely make again! ammendment We still make this all the time - just wanted to add that we've also used crunchy chow mein noodles as a topping when we didn't have all the ingredients and it's great that way too! Cook up the chicken in sesame seed oil and garlic sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds on it instead of peanuts and it's really awesome that way too!",
