I bought every frozen brand I could find and tried them all, but none was even close to my memories.  I tried making from scratch, but the texture was all wrong, and my dough was so thick it was disgusting!  Then my son gave me a pasta roller yesterday for Christmas, so I went online to find raviloi recipes that were made of beef and had a smoother texture.  I FOUND IT with this one!    I made a very small batch to start out and used the accompany pasta dough recipe.  They tasted just like I remembered!  I made another batch after that.  I did use some sausage as a few others recommended and the olive oil.  I am freezing most of them so I can eat them whenever I want with my fresh canned Marianna Sauce that tasted like my childhood.  That took some trail and error, but now with my sauce readily available and this recipe, I can relive one of my favorite meals as a child.  I was so excited to rate this recipe that I became a supporting member tonight. to whomever submitted this recipe, you have my deepest thanks, (but not the few lbs, I will probably gain from eating so many of them!)",
