But, if you don't care about calories, use frozen yogurt instead of milk--or cut the serving size in half!",

I made a horrible mistake by putting more peanut butter in then it said to and by using the Jiff Brand \"Nutella\" instead of chocolate syrup. My advise is to go with the recipe. Taste it then and if you wanna add something do it then. Not before hand just because you like peanut butter. Regardless this recipe is a great idea and I'm glad the people liked it. Maybe I will learn from this mistake.",

I used lite chocolate syrup Skippy natural peanut butter and low fat milk. I was confused to why it called for skim milk when there was chocolate syrup and peanut butter in it though. When I blended it I used a hand emulsion blender to make it easy over getting out the blender. It tasted like a slighty thick or foamy chocolate milk with a hint of peanut butter. It worked fine today to use up a couple of bananas I needed to in the fridge. Thanks",
