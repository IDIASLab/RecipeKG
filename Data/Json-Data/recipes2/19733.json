I used the entire 6 ounce block and still only used two peppers. The recipe doesn't say to do so but you really need to soften the butter almost to the point of melted to get it incorporated in the cream cheese. With that being said, my husband really liked these. If you want to save yourself some time use real bacon pieces. With a couple of minor changes, this would be a hit at a party or food day at work.",
