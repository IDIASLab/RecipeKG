Also add 1/2 tsp onion salt, and a small bag of thawed, chopped, drained broccoli, to layer with ham and cheese. It makes a huge difference. I like to cut the bread in smaller pieces (6 or 8) so the egg mixture distributed more thoroughly. Pour it in SLOWLY. If I\u2019m ambitious, I saut\u00e9e chopped onion as well. I have found that it  MUST be refrigerated overnight. Even better- Bake it a day before and warm in oven at 300 degrees before serving. It holds together better, and flavor develops. It\u2019s fantastic next day. I bake it and take it to weekend getaways. Love this casserole.",
