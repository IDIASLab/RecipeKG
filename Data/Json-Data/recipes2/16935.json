Secondly thick slices of eggplant first microwaved then fried do not work. The eggplant turns out too mushy. In each sanwich I would prefer to use 2 or 3 thinner slices that have been \"oven fried\" so there is a crispness to them. Avoid the use of too much mustard! Try using PepperJack cheese to give it some zing and toast the rolls.",

I was pleasantly surprised (and am still mystified) by the amount of flavor even without adding any seasonings. This is not to say it has a beefy flavor like a regular hamburger but for what it is it is very good. Cheap and simple to make although I can't figure out how to keep the eggplant slices from soaking up the oil/butter. I will use this recipe in the future for most of my burger cravings - it is cheaper easier and healthier! One warning: the eggplant burgers are not as good the next day even if you warm them up and put toppings on them.",
