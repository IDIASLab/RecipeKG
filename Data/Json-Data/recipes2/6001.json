The only thing in the recipe that I did differently was to use a food processor to mash and blend every thing together! Makes the consistency even more like mashed potatoes! I'm making this for a second time today!",

The only thing I did different was add a bunch of green onions to the garlic & olive oil while it roasted in the oven. Outside of that just follow the recipe. I didn't see any reason to add instant potatoes after all it was my intention to replace the starch with a healthy alternative. This is also a great way to increase your veggie intake!
