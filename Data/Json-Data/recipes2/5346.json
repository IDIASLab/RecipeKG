The only labor I expended was crushing the San Marzanos  by hand, and ladling all the fat out of the sauce that pooled to the top.  That's it!  Time and your dutch oven will do all the work for you.\n\nI didn't change the recipe at all, or make any kind of substitutions.  It took about 5.5 hours for the meat to fall right off the bones.  There were some slightly stubborn pieces of meat with that silvery connective tissue holding the meat to the bone, so I just let those particular pieces simmer in the sauce for another half hour, and they released when the connective tissue dissolved.\n\nI was wary of making this and was afraid it would be too greasy (bad experience making short ribs once), but it totally wasn't!  I didn't have time to refrigerate it to chip the fat off, so I just used a flatter ladle and poured the fat into one of the San Marzano cans.  The sauce was silky and rich, the meat was so flavorful, and I cannot wait to have the leftovers tonight for dinner.  Thank you, Chef John, for a very special recipe and for guiding me through a cut of meat I never used before!",

                "reviewBody": "I genuinely believe this is one of the best dishes I've ever made. So easy and hands-off, and intensely flavorful! I did add a dash (probably 1/4-1/2 tsp) garlic powder after tasting the final sauce, to fit my family's taste. I also wish I had added more red pepper flakes, as 1/4 tsp can't be tasted in the final sauce at all. Some notes that may help others:\n\nThis was my first time working with oxtail, and I didn't realize that some of the bones have little \"caps\" about the size of a nickel. It was easy to pull out the primary bones, but my husband got a \"cap\" in his ragu - whoops. Next time, I will go through the final sauce very carefully before serving. \n\nWe used two cans diced tomatoes plus one small can tomato sauce in place of the 4 C sauce (just because it's what we had on hand). Some additional sauce would have been welcome - it was pretty meat-forward the way we did it - and also we ended up with about a half an inch of burnt-on goo in the bottom of our pan that was hell to remove. :( So DO use that 4 C recommendation as your starting point, don't go skimpy like us! \n\nThe bright side of using diced tomatoes (and the reason I will probably use them again, albeit in greater quantity) is that the sauce was a little more chunky, so no fat skimming was necessary. All liquid left in the sauce WAS fat, so we just poured it off. Couldn't be easier. The dish still turned out moist, flavorful, and absolutely delicious, and the sauce stuck to the pasta well.",

I added a bit of diced carrot and celery to the onions/garlic and instead of simmering on the stove top I placed this in a 225 degree oven for 4-5 hours instead. My burners on my gas stove have a tendency to burn things even when on \"low\" so the oven was the better route for me. In hindsight I would add the carrots and celery a bit later as they did burn on the pan a bit while roasting the oxtail (my fault). Overall the flavors were spot on and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. We tossed this with ziti but rigatoni would be great as well. Will make again!",

The grocery stores in my area only carry one brand of oxtail in shrink wrap packages. After opening the packages I discovered one or two large pieces of oxtail in each package and lot of smaller pieces from nearer the tip of the tail I presume. So my presentation was not as pretty as Chef John's because I had to remove the meat from a lot of small pieces of bone but it still tasted great.",
