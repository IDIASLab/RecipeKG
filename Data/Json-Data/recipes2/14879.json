In fact, although I am a caterer and consider myself a very good cook; I was always fearful to attempt brisket.  I have to say I took a risk and tried this recipe for my first attempt and it was AMAZING.  My husband (a BBQ lover) raved and told me to laminate this recipe!!  This brisket was so tender,easy and delicious.  I even made it again in the same week for my extended family who now requests it at most family funtions.  I am taking the idea of offering this to my catering customers into deep consideration as well.  Thanks for the great recipe....it is definately a winner!!",

This was our second attempt and it was perfect!! Although we did make modifications - for a 5lb piece of meat we smoked for 2hrs and baked for 2hrs. We did most of the oven time at 275 except for the last 30 mins we did at 300. Also we didn't have greek seasoning so we used 2 tablespoons dried oregano 1 tablespoon dried rosemary 1 tablespoon dried onion 2 teaspoons granulated garlic 1 teaspoon dried lemon peel 1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper 1 tablespoon kosher salt And we used 2 cloves of garlic per pound being sure to squash it release flavors. We plan on making this for my kids birthday party - easy way to feed a ton of people. Oh-one more thing -we got the meat from a butcher and not the grocer -it was a much better piece of meat.",
