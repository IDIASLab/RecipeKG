Cheddar cheese melts gloppy and doesn't spread nicely at all. The second time I made it instead of melting the cheese ahead of time I just sprinkled the shredded cheese on the hot beans. The cheese melted nice as you please. We really like the zing of the uncooked garlic but others might rather have the milder flavor of having their garlic cooked in with the beans and wine. This really is a flavor combination we'd have never imagined would work yet work it did. Give it a shot you might find yourself among the converted.:)",
