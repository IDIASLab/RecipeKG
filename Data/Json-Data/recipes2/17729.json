For newer cooks, it might be helpful to recommend county style hash browns (shredded) rather than southern style (cubed). There's also a brand of 'fresh' hash browns on the market (Simply Potatoes, I think) and they work really well. At least you won't have to deal with defrosting the potatoes. \n\nAlso like others, it took much longer to prepare than suggested. For me personally, I'm sure its due to the amount of time I spent browning 2 pounds of potatoes. So here's my final recommendation: Don't spend an excessive amount of time trying to get that perfect shade of golden brown taters! They're still going to cook/crisp in the oven. My 'crust' was a little on the well-done side; any longer and it would have burned. Hope this is useful.",

Next time I might add some seasonings or fresh garlic in when browning the turkey and I'll finely chop the onions to spread out the flavor a bit more.

Once the turkey and broccoli was done I combined it with the soup mixture and dumped in 2 drained cans of diced potatoes. Once this all of this was mixed I put it in the oven for 25 minutes and it was delicious. Will definitely make again. Next time I may add a little sourcream for some zip!",

I used fresh potatoes that I shredded myself - 4 large russets to make about 2 pounds of hash browns. I cut down on the cook time by using my double-patented \"dirty the whole kitchen\" method (tm). I cooked all of the hash browns in one batch on my griddle while I browned the ground turkey and onions on the stove. I only microwaved my broccoli until it was not frozen solid as I wanted it to be crisp and not mushy in the casserole. I used 1 can cream of mushroom one half can milk and half a cup of sour cream for the sauce because I'm not really a fan of heavy \"cream-of\" flavor. I actually found that this was PLENTY of sauce for us. Using the full amount of soup would probably have ended up with mush. What we had was a surprisingly delicious casserole. I might add a bit more cheese if I made it again but otherwise it's a good go-to for a pantry-ready dish.",
