I did not like this at all. There was way too much pasta and not nearly enough sauce. A quick fix with some of the ingredients I normally use saved the dish from being tossed. I added about a cup of sour cream with a little milk to thin it poured it into a casserole and topped it with some shredded cheddar cheese. Turned a rather dry and bland dish into a pierogie casserole which was promptly polished off.",
