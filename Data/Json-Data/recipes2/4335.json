Mom sometimes used half flour and half crushed cereal. I suggest if you are looking to cut down on the salt, you use your favorite brand of seasoning salt and garlic powder. I also use evaporated milk because I like a thicker coating on my fried chicken. This adapts well to whatever you have on hand and you can always double it and keep a batch in a ziplock bag for days you're short on time.",

The only change I make is to cut the breasts up into nugget sized pieces and rather than using garlic salt and seasoned salt I use a (Lindberg-Snider) porterhouse & roast seasoning blend I have.  I bake it on wire racks over raised-edge cookie sheets so the pieces can evenly cook and are crispy all around.  I typically cook it for about 25 to 30 minutes and sometimes turn the broiler on for the last minute or so to crisp it up a little bit extra.",

I covered the schnitzels in flour then the egg wash and then the cereal mix. Baked at 375F for 25 min. The husband LOVED this. He said the crunch from the cereal was different but really good.
