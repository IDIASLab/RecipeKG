Put them in a dish. Followed the ingredients of the recipe, though I did carmalize the nuts first and adjusted the ingredient amounts to suit our tastes. Baked them covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for another 15 minutes. At first I thought I wasn't going to like them but after a couple of bites they really appealed to me and I will definitely make this recipe again. Since there are only two of us now I refrigerated the leftovers and reheated them later. They were still delicioius. Love recipes that I can use the leftovers. Cuts down on so much cooking every day.  Linda",
