I did not drain them enough and my frosting was a soupy liquid. To compensate for this I took a small portion of the soupy liquid and added a lot of powdered sugar. In the end it was all good and was a very great cake. A perfect compliment to summertime. Family liked it. Will definately use this recipe often just being careful on the frosting.",
