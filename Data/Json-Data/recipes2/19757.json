I scooped it out and served it in a seperate dish and everyone still liked it but I still found it runny. The 2nd time I substituted regular cream cheese for mayo and it came out a thousand times better. I could not find garlic & mushroom soup either time I used Lipton Onion soup mix - half pouch each time. Will be making this again - but not with mayo! I also sprinkled shredded Swiss on top in the last 5 mins of baking & it was perfectly melted.",
