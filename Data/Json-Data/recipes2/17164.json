I use a buffet 1/2 tray.. 2 boxes of potatoes but only one of the cheese mix packets. Discard the other one. Use about 3 cups of milk... I use about 1/4 of the package of the coctail weiners.. just layer them once on top of the potatoes.. don't use as much ham either. I add a little garlic too. I also use 2 cans of the french fried onions.. add extra cheese.. Bake a little longer since you are using 2 boxes of potatoes.. Be sure and taste your potatoe to make sure it is cooked all the way. I've made this dish about a dozen times and it's always the first to go on a buffet line. Well worth the FAT!:)",

First it doesn't state weather you use the cheese that comes in the box of potatoes. I used 2 boxes of potatoes and one package of the cheese which I mixed with one can of cream of mushroom 2 cups of milk 1/4 cup butter. I then only used 8oz of the coctail franks. I followed the rest of the recipe. I used a buffet half tray to bake it in. Delicious.",
