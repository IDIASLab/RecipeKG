I do use a lot less pepperoni (only about 1 oz.) and I chop it up so that I can have a little pepperoni flavor in every bite. I also use just 3-4 zucchini and about 3 tomatoes and even then I have trouble fitting it all into a 9 x 13 pan. I must be using bigger veggies. I usually add leftover cooked pasta in a layer in the middle. It makes it a little more substantial. I also serve it with french bread for dipping in the leftover juice. It just tastes so wonderful.

I also just made it one layer in the order the recipe said but that filled a 9x13 glass dish did not follow how much the recipe said to use just cut enough of each vegetable to fill the pan.
