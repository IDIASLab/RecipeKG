The kids will eat it because they have absolutely no clue that it's cauliflower low glycemic count healthy as all get out and sooo much easier than a rice paella...and it's delicious. You still get that rice like texture thanks to the method of adding the last cup of cauliflower at the end. The tomatoes leave it moist but not soupy. We served ours with corn tortillas and ate it as tacos. I had to leave out the tilapia and subbed shrimp. I cut up the chicken into bite-sized pieces before cooking. Lastly three cups of riced cauliflower was about one small head-including the stalk and leaves. (It was neither a hassle nor messy). Thank you for the recipe!!",
