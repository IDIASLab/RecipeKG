First of all, I added a couple of minced cloves of garlic, plus half an onion very finely diced to the meat mixture. I also softened a diced jalapeno in the skillet while browning the meat balls. I strongly suggest making this the day before you plan on eating it - the flavors meld so nicely. Also, if you're not used to cooking with green curry paste, add it a little bit at a time until it's how you like it. It has a very distinctive taste. Thanks, Jon!",

I also added fresh mushrooms and frozen peas. let it all simmer on low for more than the time required. Not too hot or spicy. Plain old white rice to serve it with an a green salad for DH and all was well! I will be making this one again. Oh, and the left overs for lucnh were just as good if not better! ***EDITED*** Made this for about the 4th time last night. I allways had a problem with the lamb balls getting too browned by frying them in a skillet. So I tried baking them on a cookie sheet that I sprayed with canola oil. 350 for about 25 minutes.  Perfect! Also upped the green curry paste to 3 tblsp. Used a dry steak seasoning, not a wet one and added minced garlic. Other than that I did everything I said I did in my first review. It was so much better and had less fat! DH was floored. As others have said, although this is amazing the 1st night it melds by the 2nd day it is off the chain! It is perfect as a make ahead main dish for company! That is if you are willing to share!",

Letting the meatballs simmer in the sauce for a good 10 minutes or so ensures the meatballs are cooked through and helps them absorb some of the curry flavor although I would recommend making this a day ahead to allow the flavor to really deepen. I added sliced onions and frozen peas to the sauce and served it over brown rice. I went a bit lighter on the curry sauce since I've found it too hot in the past (and I like hot food) but I think I will use the amount called for next time. My husband liked the milder curry flavor though - I guess it depends on your tolerance for hot foods and also the strength of the curry paste used - some of them can be really hot.",
