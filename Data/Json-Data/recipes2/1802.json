We start on high heat, but cook the chops on medium, and then finish the cooking by wrapping the chops in foil. This produces a very moist chop, as the meat has time to 'rest' as it finishes cooking.",

My chops were much smaller so obviously cooked them for a shorter time and by the time they were almost to the blackened state they were done so I didn't test the foil/tenting part of the cooking process. Next time I'll try to use larger ones and try that method. Regardless these are delicious chops. That rub would go well on chicken or fish as well.",
