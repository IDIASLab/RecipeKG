Once you dredge that fish in the flour the Panko would never stick. The fish was wet enough to start with so I dredged it in flour first then the milk and then the Panko. Worked like a champ. I like my fish extra crispy so I flipped them halfway though the cook time and sprayed more non-stick spray and then broiled them for a few minutes after that. Overall good recipe and one I would make again.",
