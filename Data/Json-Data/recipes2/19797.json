I also added about one fourth of a green pepper for some added flavor. I did not have heavy cream so I mixed up some milk and instant coffee cream and that did the trick. So easy and quick and flavorful. Virginia is known for its peanuts and peanut soup is a big thing.....and this is better than the traditional peanut soup in southeastern Virginia's restaurants. Garnish it with some chopped peanuts. De-lish. Served with peanut chicken sald croissants. (Im adding that recipe to the site soon). Thank you:)",

I believe they also used creamy peanut butter (personal preference) and added a little heat. I agree that it does need a kick. When I tried to recreate it I used red pepper flakes in the beginning as one reviewer suggested and it gave it a nice warmth. My only issue with it was caused by me - I only had natural peanut butter at the house and it was not nearly as nice of a consistency as our friends. Next time I ll get regular sugared peanut butter. I am rating the version we had at the party b/c I know it was good!",
