For the potatoes, I used 6 Russets (I think they were); I didn't peel them (the recipe didn't specify either way) - I just scrubbed and cubed them. This was also one of the rare occasions when I use \"American pasteurized process cheese spread\" (generic Velveeta). The cooking time of 45 minutes was not nearly enough; at that point, most of the potato cubes were still hard, and a lot more time was needed. After that, the taste was okay, but I thought there was too much salt, plus I would've liked more cheese. Still, I should add that this was best the night I made it; the quality of reheated leftovers was much diminished. Sorry, I wasn't very impressed with this.",
