I enjoyed it but will play with the seasonings some more to suit my personal tastes. I did decide to sprinkle chedder and mozza cheese over the top of the dish when 5 minutes were left and cover so the cheese melted nicely. It was very tasty (almost like pizza). I will be making this again.",

After it was all mixed together I put it into a glass baking dish (sprayed with PAM) and topped it with shredded Mozzarella. Baked it til the cheese was melted about 20 min. The cheese added to the Pizza taste. Next time I will incorporate the cheese into the mixture then bake it so you get a little cheese in every bite. My 3 teenage boys loved this even my meat and potatoe loving hubby went back for seconds...thank goodness I quadrupled the recipe:) It doesn't get any easier than this! Thanks Elizabeth!",
