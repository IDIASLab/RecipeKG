I reached for everything and followed to a T but nothing bad. I didn't have milk chocolate chips it was dark chocolate...okay a no biggie I didn't have regular graham crackers they too were chocolate grahams. SO just because of a minor flavor change it still worked. I used my Ninja chopper and crushed the grahams into fine crumbs. The only time I got worried was when I mixed the crumbs in with the chocolate mixture. Make sure with this tip...keep mixing to incorperate the crumbs fully. I lined an 8x10 pan and poured right in. It started setting immediately. Hubby says they were just fine. I tasted 2 pieces and I thought the same. I could totally see decreasing some of the crumbs and adding an addition of nuts as a spin off recipe. But all in all a nice basic recipe that can totally be a stepping stone for other fudgy recipes with other ingredient combinations.",
