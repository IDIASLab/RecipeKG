Adding a milder cheese won't work you need the oomph of a stinky blue or gorgonzola. And even then I think adding salt would be advised which I didn't do. This needs to cook at least 20 minutes it took about 26 for the rice to absorb the liquid. Lastly I subbed red wine for white but if you're wanting a presentation definitely use white. And salt!",

I needed much more liquid to get the rice softened and I've made risotto numerous times so my temps were correct. I just added more vegetable stock (instead of chicken) until softened. I also added double the cheese and used a 6 cheese Italian blend because we are not a Gorgonzola family and I omitted the white wine (used stock instead) due to an allergy and a recovering alcoholic in the family. Very tasty and very easy just time consuming as risotto should be.",
