For an adult I always serve 2 single slices of bread with the cheese tomato and bacon on each slice made open face under the broiler. No butter is used. The bread gets toasted around the edges but not much on the bottoms (I like this texture) and you get twice the bacon and cheese. The tomato tends to get juicy when cooked so I use a fork. Also when I do make bacon I cook the whole pound and freeze the extra slices in a freezer bag. (If any survive that long!) They do not stick to each other frozen. Remove as many strips as you need. It's pre-cooked and they reheat and crisp up as you broil. I especially love this sandwich when ripe tomatoes are in season. White American slices are my preferred cheese. Broil until the cheese starts to melt and brown a little where exposed. The bacon on top will also begin to show blackened high spots.",
