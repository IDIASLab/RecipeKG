I crushed the vanilla wafers in a ziploc bag and used a rolling pin. I then rolled the dough into individual balls. It was kind of messy and sticky but was not a big deal. I then sprinkled with a generous amount of powdered sugar put in a sealed container and popped into the fridge to cure. Prior to party I rolled each ball again in powdered sugar because they were a little bit sticky and then finished off by rolling in chopped nuts. You have to like rum and coconut which party guests did so they went over very well. Recipe was not difficult and I would make again.",

There is another coconut rum ball recipe on allrecipes that calls for both 1/4 cup of rum (that sounds more like it) and quite a bit of sugar. I'll bet that one tastes like rum balls.
