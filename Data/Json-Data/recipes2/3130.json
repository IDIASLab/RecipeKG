The toasting of the butter does add a little something - rustic country flavor perhaps, but nutty. I enjoyed making this recipe with both my family and was even simple enough for an after school program that I teach at. I would have liked more color on the biscuit, but any longer in the oven would have burned the bottoms. Overall it was a treat, and I'm happy that everyone loved them. - Tiffani",

I love how it holds the sweet syrup from the strawberries (to which I added a tbsp of balsamic vinegar, as suggest by chef John, amazing!), and the added texture was divine.  I will always make my strawberry shortcake this way from now on.",

                "reviewBody": "I normally use the Bisquick box recipe for my strawberry shortcake,  but was out of it and made this one by scratch. Maybe my self rising flour was too old, but these didnt rise enough for my liking. Shortbread is a drier biscuit normally, but when this didn't rise it became extra dense. Sucked all the moisture from the ice cream I layer between the bread and the strawberry juice. Truthfully, I prefer the taste and consistency of the  Bisquick shortbread.",
