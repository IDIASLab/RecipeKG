When I make it, it reminds me of the smells of her cooking in her kitchen, fresh corn tortillas, beans, and red chile peppers. You can kick up the spiciness by adding more arbol chile pods.",

My fine mesh strainer was so fine that none of the goodness was draining through. Instead of finding something that it would drain through I decided to dump it in a bowl and use it as is. Yeah, that doesn't work so well. The skin on the peppers is too tough. I knew better but was in a hurry. I strained it the next day and made it right again. With that being said, this is some really good sauce. It's a little on the oily side but still good. It's not as hot as you would think. It's basically like a really rich and robust homemade enchilada sauce. Excellent recipe!",
