I considered thinning it with a little water but I guess I would just double it next time. And I think I would maybe stir the basil into the sauce at the last minute as large chunks of fresh basil are pretty overwhelming. AND I would put the cheese on and then stick them back in the oven to melt it. I put the cheese on within 10 seconds and it still wouldn't melt. I know I could have made these adjustments along the way but I always try to make a new recipe exactly as written the first time. This could be a lot better without adding much fat.",
