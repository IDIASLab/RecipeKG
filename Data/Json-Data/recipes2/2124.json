Having read a few reviews that said was dry, I only cooked it for about 20 minutes. Everything in it is cooked already, all you really need it for it to heat through. Also, sour cream is a fantastic addition and we felt it really made the dish. It should really be part of the ingredient list. Next time I'll probably double the recipe since we barely have leftovers for one night, my husband had seconds!\n\n**Update. I made this again and doubled the recipe. I baked it for 30 minutes which was just barely enough to get it warmed through, but the top was starting to crisp. Next time I'll probably do 20 minutes covered and then 20 more uncovered to keep the top from burning. Just as tasty the second time around!",

As an experienced cook, I knew that I'd have to tweak the recipe to please our grown-up palates. I added two chopped Roma tomatoes, used sharp Cheddar and pepper jack cheeses, 1 can drained and rinsed black beans (Hormel Chili was without beans), 1 1/2 tsp. ground cumin and a few sprinkles of cayenne. I also cut the macaroni down to 6 ounces. Even with my changes, I'd use two cans of chili to relieve dryness issue. My husband likes chili mac lunches so I will be making this again. Add a nice crispy garden salad and you have a good, satisfying meal. Thank you, Hormel, for the inspiration!",

I had no macaroni pasta but I did have a package of Kraft dinner that I wanted to use up so I used that in place of the pasta portion of the recipe. I was low on cheese so was hoping the package of \"cheese\" powder would be adequate for the flavour. I used about 2 cups of leftover home-made chili with beans and only a cup of salsa as the chili was runny enough. I omitted the green pepper as there was green pepper in the chili. I threw in about a half a cup of packaged grated nacho-blend cheese topped it with another half a cup baked until bubbly and everyone gobbled it up! I'll definitely be making this again... this is a good example of a dish being more than the sum of it's parts... so simple but SOOOO tasty! Next time I'll likely try it with the macaroni pasta as per the recipe and also I'll double it as it made just barely enough for the 4 of us.",
