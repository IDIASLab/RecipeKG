My husband loves cheesesteaks and since I have a hard time getting him to eat salads this was perfect! I used a sirloin steak that I partially froze in order to get the slices nice and thin. I marinated only the steak in light Kraft Italian dressing that I perked up with some additional minced garlic and bit of oregano. I marinated it for about an hour. I sauteed the onions and pepers in a bit of olive oil and then sauteed the steak. I used light cheddar cheese on mine and provolone on my husband's portion. You can leave out the garbanzo beans if you like but I love them so I left them in the salad. To put this over the top I wanted a homemade Ranch dressing so I used \"Ranch-Style Buttermilk Dressing\" from this site. I will definitely make this again.",
