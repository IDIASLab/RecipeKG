I didn't want to make cookies or cake or pie so I thought I'd look to see what I could find that was different than the usual.  When I signed in I saw this recipe on the main page and immediately thought, THAT'S IT!  That's what I'm gonna make!\n\n62 years old and I have never made rice pudding before, even though I always liked it so wasn't sure how it was going to turn out.   It was fabulous and SO easy!   One pot is all you need and Chef John was right, it did NOT stick to the pot at all so no need to use that second pot that other recipes call for.  The only change I made was to use raisins instead of the cherries.  \n\n I will definitely be making this again!",

So good that I doubled the recipe and made the doubled recipe three times in one week (I shared, I swear). I used Arborio rice instead of long grain white, because that's what I had. I also left the cinnamon out because I like to sprinkle it and nutmeg (oh, the nutmeg!) on top. I found that turning off the heat while the pudding was still a little soupy and letting it sit for a bit made the consistency perfect, whether shortly after cooling enough to eat without burning yourself or out of the refrigerator the next day. Sooo good, and makes me feel like a kid again. :-)",

Comes out very creamy and rich. It's also super easy to make and I love that it only takes one pot. Don't be afraid of the egg trick here. As long as you stir in the egg yolk fast with the heat off, you aren't going to have scrambled egg in your pudding, trust me. The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the letter. It was perfect. In subsequent tries, I've made it with part heavy cream instead of all milk, which gave it a little added richness. I've also used other dried fruit like raisins and cranberries. You can also vary the flavoring, like almond extract instead of vanilla, or nutmeg instead of cinnamon.",
