I bake it covered, outside the turkey and since there are no juices from the turkey I add turkey broth to moisten the bread (College Inn brand is available Thanksgiving thru Christmas), chicken broth will also work; bouillon is all salt. I also mix in some grated carrot, adds a little color. I cook the vegetables and seasonings in the butter until almost tender, then gently fold into the bread cubes, alternating with broth and bake at 350 degrees until heated thru, about 40 to 45 minutes...

You may want to add a little poultry seasoning but the sage is fine on its own.  I know it looks too easy to be good.  But trust me, it is awesome.  Much better than stove top.  BTW fun for the kids.  Mom use to have me tear up loaves and loaves of bread for this and put into brown grociery bags.  If you want to give the kids something to do this would be it.  No knives needed.  Oh and recently I discovered Herb Ox chicken boullion which is awesome used as chicken broth.",

A trick I picked up from my daughter is to add a minced clove of garlic (smash first then mince) it's not enough to make it taste garlicky but it adds a certain richness and depth, plus I use a cube of butter to saut\u00e9 the onions and celery, other than that it is the same recipe.  \nI always have a lot of stuffing left over after stuffing the bird so I bake the rest of it in a dish and I add about a half a can of chicken broth so it doesn't dry out (the portion in the bird doesn't dry out). Cover the dish with foil.  A nice thing about this recipe (and most stuffings) is that you can make it up to a week before, don't add any broth to it till later. Freeze it in a couple of large baggies until the day before then thaw it (bread thaws quickly) when it thaws then add your broth. One less thing to have to think about when your fixing several things.",
