First cream of celery soup compliments the crab better than cream of chicken. I've tried cream of mushroom chicken etc and nothing is as tasty in this as the cream of celery. Second don't buy expensive finely cut hashbrowns. Buy less expensive shoestring potatoes or the cubed hash browns. They hold their texture better and absorb the butter and mixture and make a better casserole consistency otherwise it ends up soupy almost like mashed potatoes. When made right this is a GREAT side dish but you should experiment to see which way works best for you...",

Will definitely make this again with a butter adjustment. I'll also try the cream of celery soup as suggested by another reviewer. Might even add a little onion for added flavor and a light sprinkle of bread crumbs to top.",

When they were done boiling I mixed in 1 cup water with 1 can of cream of chicken soup I also threw in the crabmeat. When I was done with that I transferred it into a baking dish and topped it with cheddar cheese to make a lovely casserole. It tasted SOOOOOOO good. Hubby gobbled it up and then asked me to make it the next day. I ommited the sour cream & butter but next time I will definately add it. Thanks for the recipe!!",
