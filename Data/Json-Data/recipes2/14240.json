Made this over the weekend of the Fourth and used Sierra Mist soda which would be the only thing I change for the next time - that soda tends to taste flat sooner than most. I actually took the cherries and marinated them in vodka prior to garnishing the drinks with them. Everyone got a nice POP once they were to the end of the drink. I also halved the amount of grenadine per the advice of others.",

I juiced 2 limes since I like a sour taste and went easy on the rum...I didn't want to see double! I added some of the cherry juice which really sent this over the top. Will keep this drink in mind for summer. Thanks a bunch:)",
