Also I used reduced fat mozzarella & sour cream as well as mayo made from canola oil. The only other comment I have is that it tasted salty to me. As I'd never used hearts of palm before this may just be the taste of the ingredient. Anyway my guests still scarfed it up & one asked for the recipe which is always a good sign.",

I thought it needed more hearts of palm & a little something else maybe 1 clove garlic or a pinch of red chile pepper. I'll eventually make this again but only with changes to suit my taste.
