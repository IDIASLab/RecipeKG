I didn't have caramel sauce for the rim so I dipped it in pumpkin butter from Trader Joe's which gave it added flavor. Oh and I used 3 caramel candies in the drink. Thanks for the great recipe!",

Had some leftover salted caramel in the fridge so used it to rim the cup (after heating to soften) as well as place a generous dollop inside to melt as I stirred in the hot apple cider. I had some trouble getting the caramel to stick to the rim so I'm sure honey would be better for that but the flavor was EXCELLENT and the little hardened bits of spiced salted caramel along the edges were divine! Totally an easy indulgence on a cold winter night and I can't wait to try this rimmer method on a holiday cocktail as well!!:)",
