We also have made it with graham cracker crust and banana pudding for banana cream dessert and have made oreo dessert out of it by making an oreo crust with 1 lb of oreos, crushed and 1/4 c margarine, melted.Press into bottom of pan and let sit until cool before you add other layers. They make good no bake options. It also helps to cool all layers completely before adding next layer. We sometimes stick it in the freezer to speed it along.",

When I moved back to CA I lost the recipe and upon searching through All Recipes I stumbled across this one. Cool! I've made this throughout the last several months and is a big hit with everyone that has tried it. I'm asked to make it for our gatherings and just to have when relaxing and doing nothing. I have also passed this onto a couple of friends and now they can't stop making it for their families and associates. The changes I've tried are a thicker crust by adding more flour butter and nuts. I've also increased the size of the pan. I have found that the pudding should be at a consistency where it's creamy so that it makes it easier to spread onto the cream cheese layer. For a larger pan than the recipe calls for I use the large boxes of pudding with a small box and increase the amount of milk dependant on consistency. All in all this will continue to be a big hit and your family and friends will love once you make it.",
