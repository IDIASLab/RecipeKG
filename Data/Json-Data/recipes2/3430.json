The browned butter really gives it a wonderful depth of flavor as well as the bourbon. (It gives just the tiniest hint of bourbon flavor).   The only thing I might change when I make these again is to add only half the salt called for if you are using salted butter.  These are very very good.  Try this recipe!",

As soon as you add the 2 tablespoons of bourbon to the pan, it bubbles up and you don't taste it in the recipe.  The sea salt.....you do taste and I liked it!  I took these to girls night out and no one detected the bourbon but everyone detected the sea salt.  Needless to say, I came home with an empty container.  Yes, this is a recipe that I would make again.  Thanks  voraciousgirl, for sharing your recipe.  I've shared it too!",

A little, very little, extra work over traditional Rice Krispies bars, but well worth it.   You cannot taste the bourbon at all, but you can taste the salt just a bit.   The perfect amount actually.   It's the perfect blend of salty/sweet and the depth the browned butter and bourbon add is just a great bonus.   This IS the way I will make Rice Krispies from now on.",

Friends and strangers have approached me just to rave about these treats. \n\nThe one recommendation I do have is to use salted butter. The recipe doesn't specify which kind to use. I made a batch of this last night and couldn't figure out why the bourbon packed a bigger punch than usual because I made it exactly the same way every time. I finally realized that I used unsalted butter this time...I was shocked at the difference it made. TRUST ME - it will not be too salty; use salted butter! The recipe needs the salt in the butter as well as the teaspoon and extra sprinkle at the end to cut the sweetness of the marshmallows and to balance out the flavor of the bourbon.",
