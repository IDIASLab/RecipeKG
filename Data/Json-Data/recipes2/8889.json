Well worth the trouble to cut up the fruit and people did eat it. Thanks for the recipe.",

Used a honey crisp apple for better flavor. Used Siggi Vanilla Triple Cream yogurt for the sauce but did not mix in the salad. Set to side so people could add what they wanted and used 12 oz instead of 8. Made for a friend who just had surgery and she loved it. Will make again.",
