I went to the grocery store with a copy of this recipe,the cashier is from Phillipines and suggested that I used green cabbage instead of Bok Choy, it worked very well and it was a lot cheaper anyways. I also used chicken instead of pork. I felt this needed more sauce so I increased the amount of oyster sauce and added some soy sauce as well. I loved this dish and it is so different from what I usually make, so it was fun.",

Growing up, I had only ever seen this cooked one way - stir fry the vegetables, then add the noodles - and I always hated how hard it was to stir after the noodles were added! All Filipinos have their own preference for their pancit - I like mine with soy sauce and lots of lemon. I use just about any meat and veggies I have available at the time. The oyster sauce is a nice touch.",

She used extra virgin olive oil, 2 cloves fresh garlic minced, 1 onion diced, 1cup red cabbage shredded, 1 cup green cabbage shredded, 1 carrot shredded, salt and pepper to taste, soy sauce, shrimp/pork/chicken she would choose 1 or 2 of the meats.
