I used Coffee-Mate's creamy chocolate powdered creamer, and Wilbur Chocolate's cocoa powder (because I live right outside of Lititz, PA)!  I would suggest that you sift the powdered sugar and cocoa to break up the lumps for a nice powdery consistency.   In addition to the hot cocoa mix, I added a few Wilbur Chocolate Buds, and Hershey Hugs kisses, mini marshmallows, and peppermint sticks to stir it all up!  The presentation was adorable!",

I found a really adoreable jar at a craft store, and layered the ingredients inside. Because i did it in layers, i added a few ingredients for kicks, two layers of red sprinkles (just around the edje,) two layers of mini marshmellows, and one layer of miniature chocolate chips in the middle. (if you try this, make sure to -pack- down each layer before adding the next one!) I also used vanilla flavored creamer instead of plain for a little more depth. (also because i don't use plain creamer, and didn't want the extra on my shelf!)\r\nIt turned out wonderfully! i topped it off with a dash of cinamon and tied a thick red ribbon around the lid. It's adoreable, and he'll love it! i mixed the extra ingrediants for myself and my roommates to enjoy (this recipe makes a TON!) and we love it. thanks!",
