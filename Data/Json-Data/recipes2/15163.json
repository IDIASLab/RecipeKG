I made these for a small Super Bowl party. We dunked in either Thousand Island salad dressing or horseradish sauce. I also served Reuben sandwiches and beer. What a great combo! I only wish I'd invited more guests, because we all ate too much!  My husband, also a KSU alum, LOVED these. Our guests (not from Ohio) thought they were delicious. I followed this recipe to the letter, and it worked perfectly. I must say, it was helpful having one of my guests helping. She rolled the balls; I dipped and tended the fryer. Do not be tempted to make the balls bigger to speed up the process. With the batter they just get too big for the finger food they should be. Thanks to NC State Trooper for bringing me a taste of home!",

Dipped them in 1000 island dressing and they were calling them little ruben balls.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!\nP.S. To save time, I skip the batter part and just roll each ball in egg and then dip in italian bread crumbs. Still just as yummy without all the mess. ",

I would caution you that it will take longer than the receipe says.  They are a \"Labor of Love\".  But you will never find a frozen sauerkraut ball as good.  My regular recipe adds a bit more breadcrumb into the \"ball\".  It gives it a bit more texture.  If you have never tried these, you really should.  Each person that has moved here and tries them becomes a lifetime fan.",

Served them at a ladies Book Club and everyone gave a big thumbs up!  A bit labor intensive, but I made a batch and froze them ahead of time and that did the trick to save last minute prep.  Oh, and I also served them with a side of Thousand Island dressing as one reviewer suggested - super yummy!  Being a CA native, I had never heard of anything like these (nor my friends or family) and so now I am a big hit with the party crowd!  It's my understanding that these are common in Ohio - so Hail to the Midwest for another crowd pleaser!",
