I thought I followed the recipe to the \"T\" but the instant I added the sour cream (to the well cooled white chocolate) it instantly clumped. No amount of beating in my electric mixer would have smoothed this out. I had to add powdered sugar to salvage the frosting. Still it's not the way I expected frosting to taste. I added a pinch of salt to insure it wasn't overly sweet when I added the powdered sugar.",

To speed cooling I floated the glass bowl with the hot chocolate in a pot of ice water and continued stirring until almost set. The creme fraiche/choc mixture was a bit lumpy at first but after stirring turned a beautiful consistency perfect for cakes or cupcakes. super super sweet taste but I guess that depends on your brand of chocolate.",

                "reviewBody": "In baking and cooking, when you are attempting to combine warmed melted solids with cool non-solids (or cool non-solids that will become solid when mixed with warmed non-solids), and you would like to have the result of a creamy non-clumpy substance, you need to take the time to introduce the two ingredients slowly.  It also helps if you also get your cool substance to or close to room temperature. \n\nTherefore with this recipe, I measured out my sour cream and set it aside to become room temperature.  Then I melted the white chocolate chips and stirred them with a fork to a cooler state.  When I felt that they were at the correct temperature but not again solid chocolate, I drizzled the white chocolate into the sour cream while I was mixing on low speed.  Once they were creamed together I turned up the speed to high to make the mixture thicken. As with any cream based product, the more you mix it the thicker it will become but you must be careful you do not over beat.\n\nThis recipe is more of an icing than a frosting in my opinion. Therefore I added 2 cups of powdered sugar and a tablespoon of pure vanilla extract. Add additional powdered sugar \u00bc cup at a time until your desired thickness.  My addition to this recipe made the mixture more like a frosting for my taste and it retained the white chocolate flavor due to the additional vanilla.\n\n\nSo no problems with this recipe. It turned out excellent!!!",
