We tried it wrapped in tortilla and wrapped in lettuce leaves and we preferred it just wrapped in romain lettuce. It is a lightly sweet heat kinda sauce. We did drain the chicken a little before adding it to our wrap, but with the sauce and celery slaw you\u2019re going to have some juice regardless. It wasn\u2019t a big issue for us though cause it tastes great ! Thanks for sharing the recipe.",
