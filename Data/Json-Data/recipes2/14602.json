So I made this with a tin of mandarin oranges (forgetting my husband's childhood-bred aversion to them--oops) and fresh pineapple just squeezing juice out of the rinds into the dressing as I went and remembering some of these reviews jerking my hand back before the whole teaspoon of poppy seeds tumbled in. Oh also I had no kiwi but did toss in about 1/2 pint of fresh blueberries. And it was all terrific! Is it the poppy seeds that make it taste so special? Whatever. I'm thinking of making another to bring to a pool party next week. Katy you've converted me to a fruit salad fan! Well done!",

I found it produced a somewhat bland watery sauce. That said I like the idea of the recipe and will DEFINITELY make it again using fresh pineapple instead. The combination of citrus and honey is a delicious enhancement to fresh fruit without being overbearing. I have no doubt that using ll fresh fruit will make this a five-star fruit salad.
