Chopped up 4 granny smith apples and added some brown sugar butter and cinnamon. Cooked on top of the stove until tender. Drained the liquid and did as directed. I added a nice touch. With the liquid I drained I made a powdered sugar glaze to put on top when it cooled. Everyone loved it. Great recipe!!!!",
