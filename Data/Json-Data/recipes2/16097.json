I had been looking for a VERY simple punch receipe for a large gathering (200 people). When I found this one I was a little skeptical because it was only 3 ingredients and you just mix it all in the punch bowl. No prep work! So I tried it out and had my sisters taste test it. They loved it!! I ended up making TEN batches of this receipe and by the end of the night the punch was gone and the coffee was hardley touched! It was a hit!!! Would highly recomend it. One reviewer suggested lime sherbet and frozen limeade...I think I will try that for the next party!!",
