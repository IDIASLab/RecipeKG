The asparagus ended up being delicious but the curry dipping sauce wasn't what I had in mind. The spiced in the dip tasted good and for a while we thought the dip was ok but then the realization that we were eating spiced mayonnaise and sour cream set in. I don't think this dish is horrible and I believe many could enjoy it but it s not for everybody. I'd recommend avoiding it if you are not a huge fan of mayonnaise. For those who do like mayonnaise based dips I d recommend adding some garlic lemon juice and cayenne pepper to spice things up.",
