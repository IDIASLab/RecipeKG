I will never rate a recipe unless it is excellent because I feel personal tastes don't ensure proper criticism. But in the case where a recipe is absolutely superb, I will give my feedback and this cookie recipe is one of the best I have tried here. I added 1/2 cup of sugar, 1 tsp of salt and 1 oz of  Canadian Club Whiskey only because I wanted to enhance the creaminess of the cream cheese, and blend the flavors with the alcohol. I also remember my slovak grandmother using whiskey when she made these cookies. Your recipe brought back many happy memories. Great recipe! Thanks*****!",

My family calls them 'little cakes' for some reason.  To make a truer apricot filling than pie filling, we buy the dried apricots, then boil them until soft, then mash with sugar and a little vanilla.  The prunes get the same method but no vanilla.  Much better than pie filling.  Also, to keep your cakes neat and not split open, make sure you pinch the corners over the filling.  I then twist the dough ends after pinching to make them look pretty.  We also bake them at 375 for 9-11 minutes vs. 350 degrees.  I've been making these for over 30 years, since I was a small child helping my Mom and Grandma in the kitchen, and they're by far my favorite cookie of all time.  Enjoy!\n\nBTW--they freeze well, just don't dust with confectioner's sugar until you serve them.",

I find that the smaller you make these the less time you bake them and the moister they come out. I suggest using a shot glass (dip the rim of the glass in flour to prevent sticking). Fill with your choice of filling and fold 2 sides in towards the center (pinch to secure) or even just leave them flat. Either way these little beauties come out perfect every time.",
