Plain crackers can be ok for filler but seasoned bread crumbs are much better. Any good cook be them a chef or just a home cook always uses the three basic ingredients in most all meat dishes salt pepper and garlic. Without them simply the taste of unseasoned ground meat just doesn't cut it. Sorry but there's really room to improve this basic flavorless recipe.",

They hate any kind of \"chunks\" i.e. onions green peppers so onion soup (I just put onion powder and a bit of beef boullion bits in it) is great. I added garlic powder and salt and pepper as well and only had \"Ritz\" type crackers on hand - but was really good. Update: made this again recently. Instead of the dip mix I used garlic powder; onion salt; seasoned salt (maybe 1/2 tsp each of salts). 2# ground beef (no sausage); same amt eggs; 1/2 cup or so italian bread crumbs. It was the most flavorful meatloaf we've ever had. Update again! Made meatballs that were awesome!! using orig recipe with my corrections!",
