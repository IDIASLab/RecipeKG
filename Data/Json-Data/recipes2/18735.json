I added some extra ginger (big fan) and also saved some marinade to reduce and add as a sauce at the end.  \n\nMy Japanese mother-in-law has taught me a great trick for cooking meat like this.  It's best to cook in small batches that don't overlap in the (non-stick) pan.  After each batch, drain off excess oil and wipe clean with a paper towel.  This keeps the meat and marinade from getting to burned.  This works well for any meat that is cut into small pieces and saucy from a marinade.  Hubby says it was just like mom's cooking!!!",

I marinated the pork loin for about 6 hours before saut\u00e9ing. I saut\u00e9ed the pork on high heat stirring and cooking until brown and meat looked crispy. I cooked the meat in three small batches, drained the grease, wiping the pan clean with paper towel before adding the next batch of meat. The kitchen quickly filled up with the aroma of this marinade. This was quick and easy with wonderful results! The pork was tender and flavorful infused with the succulent marinade. Mmmm. The ginger is pronounced but it is not overpowering.  I paired this with hot rice, \u201cOriental Green Bean Salad,\u201d and \u201cEasy Bok Choy,\u201d also from this website.",

It goes very well with steamed rice steamed/boiled cabbage or lettuce.:) Thank you so much. I love the sauce as well. Also A word of advice if you are using cut up pork tenderloin. It will work and very well but make sure the strips aren't too thick. With strips the marinade needs to be stronger so the flavor would soak through. If you don't have too much time to marinade it be sure to beat it in a bag (tenderize) before hand. I know some of us are trying to use the less fatty cuts this tip and recipe is definitely good for those.",
