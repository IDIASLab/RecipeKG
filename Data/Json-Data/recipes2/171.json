After I had put the mix into ramekins and into the oven I realised I had forgotten to add the apple to the souffl\u00e9 batter (oops).  It didn't seem to hurt as they rose beautifully and we just poked a hole in the center when they were done and tipped the apple in (it was piping hot so it warmed up the apple).
