I used sesame oil instead of the evoo, quickly seared the tuna on both sides at a very high heat and did not add the teriyaki sauce into the pan. I didn't want my tuna to \"poach\". Instead I placed the sauce into another pan to heat up and once the tuna was out of the skillet I poured the sauce over. PLEASE make sure you only sear your tuna. You only want about an eight to a quarter of an inch of your fish to be cooked. Tuna should be prepared like a rare steak. Think Pink; you won't be sorry! Thanks so much for a great recipe!",

The grated carrots really make it. 5 stars!",

He omitted the sea salt since teriyaki tends to be salty & he took the suggestions of LindaMcClean w/ the exception of leaving the tuna rare. He did however leave them medium-rare which IMO were perfect (I usually like my meat medium to MW). They were juicy & flavorful! He sauteed asparagus broccoli & snap peas in some of the teriyaki sauce as well (these were just a bit salty due to the teriyaki & could have used a little brown sugar to counteract that) & then served it w/ jasmine rice & fresh sliced mangoes.",
