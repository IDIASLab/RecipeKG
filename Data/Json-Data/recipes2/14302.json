I also used extra creamy cool whip which made it thicker (and made it stick to the fruit more!). I used strawberry cream cheese but think it would also be excellent with pineapple or mixed berry cream cheese. Whipping the cream cheese prior to adding the marshmallow cream and whipped topping is a good way to avoid lumps. I will be making this again!",

After making this at least a dozen times for family & work get-togethers, I still get compliments.  \nI use 8oz flavored cream cheese, and mix in a few tablespoons of powdered sugar after everything else is blended together.  I've used plain, pineapple, strawberry, honey nut, and blueberry cream cheese and they all turn out great.  Some work better with certain kinds of fruit, but apples are always a favorite.  Try strawberries, pineapple, honeydew, cantaloupe, graham crackers, ginger snaps, etc.\nI typically make the night before and it always tastes great.  Keeps in the refrigerator VERY well... longer than the fruit!",

This makes a thicker dip that sticks to fruit better. Great with vanilla or a little OJ concentrate. Might be good with a splash of Frangelico or Amaretto liqueur as well. We like it with apple slices or strawberries. Makes a great dish for a a baby shower or other get-together. I slice apples and dip them in acidulated water (water lemon juice) and arrange them on a platter with this dip. It doesn't last!",
