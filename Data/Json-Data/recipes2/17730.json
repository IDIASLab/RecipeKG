Just lightly dust chicken in flour seasoned w/ salt & pepper.  No specific amt - just what it takes to dust chicken. Fry in some butter & olive oil and put aside. Then gently fry the mushrooms and garlic- adding a tad more olive oil and butter and, yes, I added about 7 chopped garlic cloves.  This mixture can be put in the frig until your ready to make the gravy!   (2) Re: the gravy - the receipe uses waaaaaaaay to much flour - which is why others had to add more beef stock and Marsala.  You only need 2T. flour to each 1 cup liquid - so base your broth & wine accordingly (more gravy requires more flour and liquid). AND, 2T flour requires 2T of fat (butter/oil combo).  Once the flour has been blended into the fat over low heat, stir until smooth and bubby - add liquid, salt and pepper to taste, stirring constantly.  I did NOT use any browning liquid. Add chicken/mushrooms/ garlic, cover and put in 350 oven for 25 minutes! Your company can be eating their salad during this time. Delicious!!!!! Need more spices - just add what you like.  I took the suggestion of adding basil.\n3: Some also said the entree was bland - I took the suggestion of soaking the thin spaghetti noodles in the spice/oil/water combo prior to boiling - FANTASTIC!\nThe nice thing with this dish is that most can be made ahead - as the restaurants do! This is a keeper for me since we do a lot o",

I did not use chicken, only because I had pork tenderloin to cook tonight.  This recipe is suitable for either, and whether you use chicken or pork tenderloin, both are lean, tender meats that require brief cooking.  I saw no need, then, to bake this \u2013 and I didn\u2019t.  I saut\u00e9ed the sliced Portobello mushrooms in olive oil.  I removed them from the pan, added a little more olive oil and butter, and BRIEFLY cooked the flour/salt/pepper dredged meat, a few minutes on each side.  (I cut the pork tenderloin into medallions) I removed the meat from the pan and kept it warm while I made the sauce: I again added a little more olive oil and butter to the pan and BRIEFLY cooked the garlic before deglazing the pan with the marsala, then added a slurry made with a SMALL amount of flour and beef broth.  Browning sauce was not necessary (see my posted photo). I served this over spaghettini with garlic, butter and olive oil.  The meat was moist and tender, the sauce rich and flavorful, the Portobello mushrooms the perfect complement to both \u2013 just a beautiful dish. I rate this 4 stars rather than 5 because in my opinion the large amount of flour called for is not only unnecessary but excessive, olive oil is more appropriate for this dish than vegetable oil, browning sauce is not necessary, nor is the baking step.",
