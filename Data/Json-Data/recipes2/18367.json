Once everything was put together I thought they were good but not anything I'd likely make again at least not without some tweaking. This is a great base recipe though. It definitely needs \"something\" I'm just not sure what. Salt and pepper helped once I added them. The salmon taste is very mild like the other reviewer mentioned so don't be afraid to try this recipe. I think these would be quite tasty with capers. I had to add in extra mayo because the filling was too dry. The are definitely quick and easy though!",
