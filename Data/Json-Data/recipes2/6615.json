I reduce the fat by letting the almond butter separate and pouring off the oil. It really does say 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, but adjust the cinnamon to your taste. Any time we have extra bananas, I cut them into chunks and freeze them in a plastic container so that I always have some ready to go.",
