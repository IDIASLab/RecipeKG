I didn't let it cool and when I started frosting with the chocolate I had the coconut oozing out all over and it made a real mess. Fortunately putting it in the fridge for an hour saved it. Once it set a bit I kind of smooshed everything back it and refrosted over with more chocolate frosting. It ended up looking great and tasting even better! I used devil's food cake mix and milk chocolate frosting...next time I think I will try dark chocolate frosting. Thanks!",
