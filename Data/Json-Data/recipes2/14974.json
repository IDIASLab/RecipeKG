I found this recipe by doing an ingredient search for pancakes made without milk. Wow am I glad we ran out of milk! Don't be turned off by the bad reviews. They just needed to play around with the recipe a little. These are the changes that I made: Used apple juice (since I didn't have apple cider) added 1/8 teaspoon salt to enhance flavor and added 1/2 cup extra juice after cooking oats in microwave to thin out batter (and it also cooled the mixture quicker). I added oats apple juice vinegar butter and raisins altogether before cooking. This melted the butter and also softened the raisins. Then I added the extra 1/2 cup apple juice after the oat mixture was microwaved. This cooled the oats enough to add the 2 eggs without scrambling them. After stirring in the eggs I added the flour and baking powder and mixed thoroughly. I used a gravy ladle to pour into a cast iron skillet on medium to medium low flame with a little oil and butter for frying. You can not cook these too quickly. After pancake turned golden brown around edges I flipped them and cooked another 45 or so seconds. I put pancakes on plate and buttered tops and drizzled maple syrup over top. Delicious! Made a batch with raisins and without...I prefer without but thats a matter of taste. Thanks Bob for the recipe!",
