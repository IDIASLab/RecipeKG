I put the water on for the pasta first thing thinking it would be easier (and tastier) to keep the pasta warm if needed than the sauce. I did not pre-cook the asparagus just sauteed with garlic. The sauce was not too thin as mentioned by previous reviewers but I did make a half-recipe. The delicate flavor of the asparagus comes through beautifully. I did not find this dish bland at all. I did sprinkle with garlic pepper and Parmesan after serving but I sprinkle garlic pepper and Parmesan on most of my food =)... Thanks for a great recipe.",

It definately took longer than 10 mintues to thicken, so plan on at least 20 minutes (and be flexible in cheating by adding a bit more roux (1 tablespoon each melted butter and flour mixed well) to help speed things up).  As far as flavor, I felt this recipe needed quite a bit more lemon to spruce it up.  The lemon and asparagus go wonderfully together, so don't be shy.",
