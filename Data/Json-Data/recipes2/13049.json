I followed the recipe as written with two exceptions: 1. wildideabuffalo.com sells buffalo tenderloins which I used in a 5oz. size perfect for this recipe. Wild Idea's mission is to restore the Great Plains one acre at a time by farming buffalo in a humane and environmentally and ecologically sound manner. Their meats are delicious. 2. Not having any bourbon I used Crown Royal. The results were outstanding and the recipe has gone directly into the special guest file.",
