I used fresh zucchini, yellow squash, broccoli and carrots as that's what I had in the house. We generally don't eat frozen vegetables. So the only adjustment was to add the carrots, finely chopped, in with the vegetables at the beginning. Also, I used homemade chicken broth and pasta. This will definitely make it into our spring/summer meal rotation!",

Also used rigatoni..would have used campanelle if I'd had some...a shape to hold the sauce. One-pot method:  cook pasta, drain in colander, set aside. Saute onion and carrot in same pan until slightly softened, add asparagus, peas, and garlic, cook a minute or two more. Add butter, stir to melt, sprinkle flour over (as in making gravy), stir gently and cook a couple more minutes to cook flour. (Mixture may look pasty.)   Add broth, bring to low boil while stirring.  Add capers, lemon juice, and pasta.  Break pasta apart gently.  (Pasta will be stuck together but will break apart easily in the heated sauce.)  Add parsley and cheese at serving. Will definitely make this again...excellent recipe for using asparagus; excellent flavor.",

For the sauce I followed the recipe but I also added the zest of one lemon and I used 4 tbsp of lemon as I like my sauce lemony. In addition I added 2 tbsp of chopped fresh basil. Once the pasta was done I added in the sauce and dropped crumbled feta cheese on top along with the tomatoes and fresh basil leaves. It was incredibly awesome.",
