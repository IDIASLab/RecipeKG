My husband loves it anytime of year, especially on cold days.  Serve with grissini, or garlic croutons.  Can be reheated, but may need to be thinned with heavy cream or water.

Instead I cooked the lentils in vegetable broth. I left out the olive oil and used some leftover green onion (again didn't want to use 1/4 of a regular onion) that I threw in at the end of the cook time. My red lentils soaked up the broth within 20 minutes (didn't use a pressure cooker) so I added 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup skim milk when I added the lemon juice. I used 1/2 tbsp of dried parsley and went a bit heavier on the black pepper. Overall this was a pretty quick lunch. Not something I'd want to eat over a few days but as a one time midday meal it was good (and healthy!).",
