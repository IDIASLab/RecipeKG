I NEVER measure) the sauce because I mixed it with angel hair pasta red pepper spinach and grilled chicken and we like a lot of sauce. Used ginger instead of galangal. Also as odd as it may seem (because we can NEVER exactly follow a recipe) we mixed in chili paste mozzarella cheese and more cilantro to the final product and it gave it more of a punch... and I just love cheese. Not that the recipe wasn't great before the add-ins but we will continue to make with the add-ins.",
