I made my own homemade dry ranch seasoning mix, cut the dill weed back to a teaspoon (only because my dry ranch seasoning mix has dill already in it) and I used two bags pretzel chips. Mine took almost 45 minutes to bake for each pan, not 20. Next time, I think I'd increase the oil. Great tasting snack mix. Cheap to make and both the pretzel chips and the Goldfish crackers I bought for next to nothing at Grocery Outlet and all the other ingredients I had on hand or I made myself, which helps when you've got a whole family that loves to snack! This will make a good lunch filler-outer and Movie Munch. I'll be sure to write butter-flavored popcorn oil on the grocery list and make it with it the next time.",

I only made half a batch (small party) but the result was wonderful! This was incredibly quick and easy to make. Unfortunately it's also a bit addictive. I can't stop eating the leftovers! UPDATE - Twice this recipe has come to the rescue! My son needed something to take to a party and time was very limited. I threw this together in minutes! It's also very versatile - just sub in whatever small crackers and pretzels you have on hand. This time I used two types of small pretzels goldfish and oyster crackers. Delicious!",
