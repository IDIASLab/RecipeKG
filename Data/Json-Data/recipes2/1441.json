A few changes: I used butter instead of oil -- butter is a must for bringing out the flavor of mushrooms. Also skipped the dijon since I didn't have any and the recipe seemed fine without it. I used sour cream in lieu of yogurt.  Yum!",

My go to now is to slice the tofu relatively finely Chuck it in a bowl with some oil pop my fave spices on mix a bit of flour and baking powder in with it and whack it in the oven to dehydrate and get crispy. Soooo super tasty and can be made with any flavoring to suit any dish. What I didn't account for was that when I chucked it into the mix - I waited until I had thickened the broth - that it would get super extra thick from the little bits of crumb that came off of it. So I added extra water. Lovelovelove it and served it with some beautifully fluffy pilaf.",
