Try making this recipe with these changes: use white or yellow cake mix, only 1 box vanilla pudding and only 1 (8 oz) container Cool Whip (everything else is the same as the recipe).  Mix and bake cake according to directions for 9x13 pan.  Let cake cool, then top with drained crushed pineapple. Mix vanilla pudding according to pkg directions, then add cream cheese and mix till smooth (be sure to mix very well to avoid lumps of cream cheese in the topping).  Fold Cool Whip, and maraschino cherries into pudding/cream cheese mixture. Spread evenly on top of pineapple.  Top cake with coconut and chopped nuts.  As written this recipe has the pineapple on top of a huge mound of pudding and Cool Whip.  This is a great recipe with these alterations.",

But, I got clear plastic cups, dished cake and other ingredients and layered as directed into cups. Added a cherry and orange slice on top to make a Pina Colada 'drink'. Served with a spoon. Great for a group of 5 and 6 year olds! They loved it and it put the other moms' Hawaiian desserts to shame! Thanks!",
