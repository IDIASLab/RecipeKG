I've tried a few different variations, including banana, butterscotch, and chocolate, but pistachio is still my favorite (and I'm not even a big pistachio person). As an added bonus, the spring green color makes it a good pick for St. Patrick's Day or Easter!",

To \"jmellas\", is it possible that you picked up the \"cook and serve\" kind of pudding rather than the \"instant\", by accident? This happened to me once (only in the reverse) since the boxes looked extremely similar. This would explain why your pudding layer remained a \"soupy mess\". Otherwise I don't see how the pudding layer would not have firmed up a bit. I hope this lends some insight on what might have happened.",
