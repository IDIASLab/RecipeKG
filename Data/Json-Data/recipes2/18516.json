My only complaint has been that it does not thicken like Hidden Valley especially for using as a dip. I also like the idea of using a buttermilk powder. So when I mixed up a batch this time, I did not use the saltines, but added a 1/2 cup buttermilk powder instead. The flavor is still great. When I mixed up the dressing, just used milk instead of buttermilk since I had used the powder. This recipe is great for using in other recipes, meals that ask for a package of dry Hidden Valley. It's way cheaper & of course far healthier. Also, I use good Celtic sea salt & don't like to use the premade onion & garlic salts because the table salt in it is horrible. So I omitted the garlic & onion salts, and instead did the conversions needed to add an extra tablespoon of garlic & onion powder & the salt separately. I worked out great. I'm experimenting now w/ added a bit of guar gum which is a natural thickener to see if I can thicken it up. Then it will be perfect! Also, my next experiment will be to mix some up using greek yogurt instead of mayo to see how that tastes & see if I can make it a nice lite ranch!",

I would say better than bottled ranch but it's SO much better it's like a different dressing. My dislike for the bottled dressing has been growing for years. I remember when Hidden Valley Ranch first came out - it didn't have buttermilk powder in it. After mixing it up I just wanted to drink it from the jar it was so good. I've NEVER wanted to drink the bottled Ranch or HVR with buttermilk powder. Not even in the same galaxy IMO. Now I have a dedicated mixing jar, wide mouthed so I can whir it up with my stick blender, and a dedicated refrigerator container as well, which is an empty plastic honey jar with the mess-free squirt top. I don't like measuring mayonnaise in a measuring cup because it's messy so I place the jar on my kitchen scale, zero it out, and add 8 oz mayo, 8 oz buttermilk, 4 oz sour cream, and the dry mix. In another recipe, I read about adding 2 t dill pickle juice, boosting the tanginess and also the dill flavor, which I love. I intend to keep it mixed up and on hand from now on. This is a delicious recipe.",

The only substations I made were that I used all onion powder instead of onion powder and onion salt I added some dried chives because I accidentally bought them for this recipe before realizing that a different ranch recipe called for them and I used onion flavored brown rice snaps instead of saltines due to food allergies. I haven't been able to have ranch dressing or mix since being diagnosed with allergies and am so excited to have this recipe! Next I'll try making dressing with it.
