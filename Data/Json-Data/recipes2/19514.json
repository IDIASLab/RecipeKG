My boys gave this dessert rave reviews and they had seconds. It was a little labor intensive but the result was exquisite. I think this would make an amazing special occasion dessert. It seems fancy and special. I will make it again! By the way... Despite using this web site for roughly 14 years this is the first time I've bothered to write a review! If your berries aren't very sweet you may want to add a bit of sugar to the chopped berries on top. PS: I thought about using Walker's Shortbread cookies but we ended up keeping those to eat. So... I used a 10 ounce box of Lorna Doone cookies for the crust and added a bit more melted butter. I only had a 10 inch spring form pan and it worked out very well.",

I think the reviews stating it was too sweet may have used premade whipped topping which definitely would have made the pie too sweet. Making whipped cream with no added sugar, as the recipe states, was the perfect amount of sweetness. Sometimes cutting corners for convenience does not come out on your favor. It is also important to FOLD NOT STIR and do NOT over fold. Issues with the pie setting are due to over folding and/or whipped cream that has not been whipped enough/properly. Also, with the premade shortbread pie crust, I did an egg wash and baked for 7 minutes and allowed it to cool before adding the filling. I am looking forward to trying this with raspberries next!",
