I didn't have any bacon so I used Olive Oil and Butter to cook the Chicken in (which worked wonderfully) I doubled the recipe and the only thing that I would do different next time is LESS SALT. When I doubled the recipe it then calls for 3 teaspoons - way too much salt. OH and I also added another Tablespoon of Oil to the Marinade. Other than the salt I thought this was a fabulous recipe! Since the breast were thinner cooking time was a lot less. Next time I will use less salt and top with the Bacon.... YUMMY!",
