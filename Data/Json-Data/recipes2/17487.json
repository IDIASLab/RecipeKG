When I made it I did not marinate the chicken in the sauce, I cut the chicken in strips, like for fajitas, and sauteed them in a skillet, then I just added the sauce to the chicken.  You can completely avoid the \"buffalo wing\" flavor if you use an authentic mexican hot sauce like Cholula.  I then serve it with flour tortillas, rice and beans.  Homemade salsa and chips.  YUMMY!",

The taste of the sauce was basically like a watered down traditional buffalo wing sauce. Since we like our buffalo wing sauce with a fuller flavour this watered down version was a bit disapointing. My husband basically said that it would have been better (and easier) if I had just poured regular buffalo wing sauce over the chicken. I think if you find the regular buffalo sauce to be too spicy this would be great to coat either chicken breasts or even regular wings.",
