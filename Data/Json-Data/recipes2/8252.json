I used about 1/3 lb. of bacon and it seemed like plenty. It may work better if you cooked the bacon and sprinkled it on with Parmesan cheese and lemon zest. This will reduce the amount of grease in potatoes while cooking. I reduced the amount of Parmesan cheese some also to about 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup per pound of potatoes. The lemon zest was very good and really added a great flavor to the dish. I loved this dish and will make it again for sure.",
