After following the recipe the first time to get a feel for the flavors, I added fresh basil, thyme, and pine nuts to it the second time around. The Tuscan broth brings a lot of different flavors to the recipe so there's no need to add much in the way of seasoning. NOTE: It's a myth that you must stir risotto non-stop. It can't be left unattended for long, but if you must do things while you prepare it (measure an ingredient, tend to another dish, etc.), you can.",

It takes a little while but it's well worth it. It tasted wonderful it wasn't too heavy but had plenty of flavor. A new favorite of mine. I do recommend using the 1/2 cup at a time method for adding the broth it helped the risotto to cook very nicely and evenly. However I would say that how much broth you use is more \"season to taste\". Using the entire carton of Swanson ended up being unnecessary and I was left with about a fifth of the container. It turned out wonderfully absolutely perfect in my opinion so just be aware you don't necessarily have to use all of it!!",

I did not find the tuscan flavoured broth so I just used regular chicken broth no extra spices. (I was serving it with steak and balsamic saut\u00e9ed mushrooms so I figured I could afford not to.) I also made this with a metal pot and started getting some sticking to the bottom about halfway through the broth. I'll try a nonstick saucepan next time and see how it works out. I heated the broth to start but didn't clue in that I should probably have left it on a stove top constantly warming as that might have helped. I'll also try that next time around. My wife said she liked it so I guess it was a success. Thanks for sharing.",
