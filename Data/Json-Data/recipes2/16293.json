For anyone else making it on the fly instead of marinading the salmon in OJ for 8 hours I marinaded about 2 and then poured the oj into the dish to bake with them. (Of course this meant the entire fish didn't have the coconut coating but I toasted coconut to serve with it to compensate) I also didn't have orange marmalade.. so I used apple and added a ton of orange zest. It did lack something (which was probably due to not really following directions) but it was still really good. I might try to add ginger to the sauce I think it might round the flavor out nicely.",
