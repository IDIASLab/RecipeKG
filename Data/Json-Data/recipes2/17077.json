I doubled the recipe and made it in a two gallon plastic baggie. Kept it in the freezer for a few days before serving. When it came time for serving i put some ice cubes in an ice bucket placed the bag in and closed the top. It stayed slushy for a good 5 hours. Will I make it again? Only if someone requests it. Too sweet for me. _ those of you afraid of the bourbon- don't be; it adds a nice warmness to the end of the sip.",
