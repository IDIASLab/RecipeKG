A very elegant dessert. The photo showed 1 large tart but the directions were for 4 individual tarts. I made them as individual tarts and liked it that way even though the portion was perhaps slightly big (given it's nuttiness and sugar content) after a medium-sized dinner. Note: The directions said to use four 3 3/4 \" tart pans but I used four 4 3/4\" round creme brulee dishes and that worked out perfectly. I did bake them a slightly shorter time than the recipe called for. I just ran my knife around the edges and it came out nicely onto the dessert plates having just sprayed the dishes with PAM spray.",
