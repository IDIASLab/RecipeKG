First many people do not realize that when it calls for MAYO it means real Mayonnaise like Hellman's or Kraft's. NOT MIRACLE WHIP. Also when you mix it up it should sit overnight in the fridge. That part was omitted when they posted the recipe...not sure why. And last I used Zesty Italian mix which is much zippier than the regular. It is definitely saltier than some may like but if the cucumber is thick enough then it cuts the saltiness. I read where someone basically shaved the cucumber for some thin slices but we like biting into a chunk of cucumber that's sitting on a dollop of the dip. Like another reader we've had this stuff for breakfast on many occasions! It's THAT good! I've never had a left over when I take this to any function or event. Best of luck!",
