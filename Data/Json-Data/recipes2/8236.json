Instead of using blue cheese dressing i used ranch dressing and just kept the blue cheese for the crumble for the top of the dish. Doing so made this dish Perfect! I also used franks hot sauce for buffalo wings, not just hot sauce. Would for sure make this dish again with my little changes to it! Everyone thought it was so good!  it was perfect it didn't have to much of a hot kick to it which was nice, just the right amount.",
