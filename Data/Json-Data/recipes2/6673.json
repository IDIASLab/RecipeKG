I did add the extra eggs 4 since 3 didn't quite seem enough. I used a mixture of Pizza Blend cheese and Queso cheese blend and opted out the nutmeg as I am not a huge fan. I spread the mixture out on a large cookie tray with sides sprayed with cooking spray and baked at 425 for 25 mins. really am impressed with how good these turned out and will definitely be making them again.",
