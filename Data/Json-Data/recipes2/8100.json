Which seemed way too much and I should have realized this!  After cooking all I could taste was strong cumin.  \nI prefer the instapot, so I'd like to try this one again with the spices listed, but instead of 1 lb, make 5 lbs of meat.  This needs lime!  I'm either going to garnish it as such or add it in when cooking.  The same with onions.  Either as a garnish or when cooking.  \nI agree with the other reviewers.  It's not the meat that makes this meal, but likely what you garnish your tacos with... Like cabbage, red onion, lime, etc.  I prefer this combo with soft tacos instead of the corn tacos.",

Someone also noted a cabbage slaw, which sounds great.   Make sure you allow time to cook for larger pork tenderloins as 1lb. Is on the smaller side.  Im looking forward to beating someone to any leftovers.",
