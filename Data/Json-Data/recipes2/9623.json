I changed a few of the fruits depending what was available at the store. The only changes I would make to this fruit salad is reduce the honey dressing by half. It was just too much and very watery on the bottom. Also the amount of fruit in this recipe is overkill. The amount of fruit listed above makes 2 trifle bowls worth of salad. I'll be eating leftover fruit for a few days.",

I wanted a smaller size so I skipped the cantaloupe and I didn't measure the other fruits. I omitted the nutmeg...the hint of cinnamon was just right the dressing is soooo amazing! I did not halve the grapes or dice the kiwi...they are both so beautiful as they are with delightful mouth feel! Red grapes not available used green. Used frozen strawberries as I could not find ripe fresh and I used a full 2 Tbls of confection sugar in the cream cheese. Served the whipped topping on the side so guests could add as desired... skipped the nuts. I served this with the 'Yogurt Cake' recipe found on this site which is lemon flavored. OMG! My brother had 2 servings and also finished the rest off later. I can't wait to make this again!!!",
