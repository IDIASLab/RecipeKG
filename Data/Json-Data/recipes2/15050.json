As others mentioned a little cream cheese would have put this over the top! The one down side of this was really due to my own preferences - having never had smoked salmon before I found it to be much more salty than I thought it would be. I'll make this again but go easy on the salmon next time or maybe try a different brand.",

Knowing how he loves his bagels and cream cheese with his salmon I added some little cubes of it to the eggs along with the salmon. I also added some dill. He thought this was just okay thinking the combination (as I had thought myself) of the salmon with the eggs just a little too odd.",
