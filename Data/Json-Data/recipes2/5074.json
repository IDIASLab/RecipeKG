I subbed cotija cheese for feta because it's what I had on hand, and it's a cheese that's between parmesan and feta so it worked great. Served it with some Pita chips and it was devoured!

It did cry for some garlic though, so when I knew that I was going to serve this \"bruschetta\" style, I broiled some sliced bread and rubbed the toasted slices with a raw garlic clove and brushed them with a bit of EVOO! It was perfect, and everyone at dinner last night thoroughly enjoyed this appetizer! Will make this again!",
