Used pre-cooked, de-tailed shrimp, and made the following changes in accordance with reviewer's suggestions:  1. used 5T green onions (about 3 scallions total), 2. added two cloves of crushed garlic, 3. added only about 6 oz cream cheese, 4. increased white wine to 1/2 cup, added BEFORE cheese so it could reduce a little bit.    It turned out wonderfully-- savory and rich, and not too seafoody.  Thanks so much for this recipe!",

I used reduced fat cream cheese which was fine but I could kinda tell so I won't do that next time. The sauce was incredibly thick so I doubled both the milk and chicken broth (in replace of the wine). Even with the extra liquids it was very thick and rich. I served it over rice as many reviewers suggested but after having had the dish I think that pasta would have been MUCH better. Oh- and I doubled the bread crumb mixture over top.
