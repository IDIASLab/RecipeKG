If you use the full amount of wine, you will need to reduce it to about half to achieve the best flavor and consistency.  Also, I wanted a more intense garlic flavor, so I made the garlic butter a day ahead and added a pinch of salt.  I also added 1 cup broccoli and 1/4 cup freshly roasted red peppers to the pasta to make this a one dish meal.  I will try adding asparagus next time.",

We really enjoyed this version of scampi. I've never used wine in my butter sauce and it added a nice flavor, although I did cut back to about half a cup. I used a whole head of garlic and also added some olive oil to the butter. Very nice Robin and thanks!",
