But I base my rating on the original recipe, as it should be. They taste like just the right amount of chocolate but ultimately end up pretty flat if you smash them down some like you're told to. \n\nMy only changes were that I added crushed soft peppermints to the cookie mix and made these into sandwich cookies, like a whoopie pie, I then rolled the sides in crushed soft peppermints as well, for an extra kick. I wanted them to be more stackable so I couldn't have the marshmallow on top for them to stick together.",
