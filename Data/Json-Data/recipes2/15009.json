Add 1 Tbls. cumin, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, 1/8-1/4 c. chopped cilantro and 1/3 c. fresh lime juice with pulp (1-3 limes depending on size.) Make sure you drain all cans before adding to salsa. It tastes best if you let it chill for 2 days. Excellent over rice! 6/20/06 - I have made this three times already. It makes taco salad wonderful! I just can't get enough of it!",

I admit there was something missing and per usual I tweek these recipes and end up with new favorites. Anyway I realized it was vinegar but I didn't know what kind to use. My roommate suggested cider vinegar and that did the trick perfectly! I didn't even bother with the fresh tomato because the Rotel was fine for me. We munched on this before dinner with baked corn chips. Homemade pita chips would probably be fine too. We ate so much I had to make another batch. The second batch I used the Rotel with lime and cilantro and added chilis separtely. Impossible to screw up! I too used the cilantro inside instead of as a garnish. Also added a dash of salt and pepper.",
