I could only marinade for 2 hours so I decided to stuff some bits of strawberry in the steak like you would with garlic. I dont have a normal grill so I put it on my George Foreman grill for 5 min with the layer of strawberries still on top. The only word to describe this marinade is \"Amazing.\" The simplicity of it all I think is really the best part. The only thing I would change would be to puree some strawberries and put them in the marinade to really get the flavor in the steaks without having to clean mushy and sticky strawberries off the top of the grill. I will definately make this one again.",

I could not find a star fruit at any of the 3 super markets here in town so I made a judgement call and used a mango. I know what star fruit tastes like and it would have made this an incredible recipe hence my 5 star rating. The mango is awesome as well if you can't find star fruit...I used 1 for 4 steaks and it worked out perfectly. Thanks for submitting such an easy tasty recipe...we enjoyed it very much.",
