I didn't have green onions but I had red onion on hand and that tasted just fine in this. I added black pepper and salt to taste. I'll probably make this one again.",

The honey added a touch of sweetness which went well with the peaches and pecans.  My only complaint is that the serving size was too small!  It left me wanting more.  Will use more chicken next time.  I served this on a bed of lettuce/spinach mix.  My peaches and pecans came in on a shipment from The Peach Truck, which delivers fresh Georgia peaches and pecans to the Midwest.  Spectacular flavor and supreme juiciness in the fruit.",
