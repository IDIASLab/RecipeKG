Last night I decided to brine the pork chops first and was very happy with the result. I put 2 pork chops in a large zip lock bag with a mixture of one cup of water to one table spoon of salt. I didn't want to make it any more complicated because the rub is so flavorful. I let it brine in the fridge for about 3 hours (so as not to over brine). Then I rinsed them in cold water and patted them dry. I applied the rub and let them come to room temp about a half hour. Then I seared them and baked them @ 425 for 25/30 min. They came out very moist and delicious. It's a great way to prevent drying out. I did cut back on the salt in the rub by half because of the brine. There was plenty of left over rub. I should have stored it in a jar because I will def be making it again! I served with pineapple mango salsa and black bean and corn salad. For appetizers i made guacamole and salsa and we drank margaritas and coronas. Great easy fun and very flavorful dinner to entertain.",
