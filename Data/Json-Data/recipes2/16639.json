I doubled the herbs as well to thinking that this would make up for the loss of the cheese flavor. The second time I used a Belgian waffle-maker and that really made the recipe. They were crunchy and flavorful and they'll be a permanent component of my Eggs Benedict from now on! I really recommend that you try these that way.",

Our gouda was not a really strong gouda and the flavor didn't come out too much.
