This morning I decided to try this recipe as it seemed it would have the same texture a little dry. You can always serve with more sauce if you want it wet but it needs to be dry to hold together. I made them in the larger muffin tins as I wanted more spaghetti per serving. The size was perfect. I crumbled a little american cheese on the top and garnished with fresh cut chives. This was the \"bomb\"! Now to share this recipe with my sister! Thank you Anna Berman for sharing.",
