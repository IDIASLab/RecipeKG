In another pan I nelted the butter salted and peppered it then threw in the garlic. After that was cooked down some i thre in the onions and sweated them. Then added the zucchini right before the chicken was fully finished. I cut the chicken in bite sized pieces and tossed back in the original pan when it was done then I added the chicken to the other pan with garlic onions and zucchini. Salted a little more and added the rest of the butter. Everything turned out really good. A nice quick easy and delicious recipe. Also very healthy.",
