Instead of the mandarin oranges and orange juice, I added orange zest (approx. 1 tsp) and then squeezed 2/3 C juice from the oranges and added that to the sauce.  This added the perfect amount of orange flavor without the extra calories of the orange marmalade alternative.  I also cooked the chicken in olive oil and sesame oil instead of butter for a more asian flavor.  I tossed in some broccoli toward the end and let the sauce thicken.  It tastes better than takeout!  You might want to toss in the cashews right before serving (or if reheating in the microwave, add after nuking) because they lose their crunchiness if they get cooked too long or microwaved.",
