I used 1/4 tsp of salt and found it way too salty. I found that 1 inch of turmeric was enough only to cover one side of the breast so I doubled the turmeric and added a bit of oil to the paste to help it smooth out. I then baked the chicken instead of frying it. Adding fresh ground black pepper to turmeric gives a boost to your health.",

I did leave the skin on and it took a little longer to cook. But this was such a pleasant surprise! Such flavor! And the skin came out crispy. The meat was gender and moist. I will be making this quite often. We served it with a spinach salad. Thank you for a new favorite!!",

I used chicken thighs and followed the recipe to a T. However when the first few chicken thighs were done I did a taste test and felt that they were missing something. I used coconut milk fat as a sort of finishing butter. Excellent addition! Next time I ll cook the thighs in coconut oil and add the coconut milk fat again. Definitely making this again!
