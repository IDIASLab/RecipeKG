It didn't seem right so I measured about 1/8 cup and only used about 1/4 of that. It was so salty that I had to rinse all the sesame oil and salt off and then re-add the oil. Otherwise it was tasty. We ate it by itself and then put it over a bed of Dole baby sweet greens that had a little chopped up grapes & apples some grated parmesan and Italian dressing and it was good that way too. Also I didn't us a bunch of scallions; it also seemed like way too much. I only used 1/2 a bunch if that.",
