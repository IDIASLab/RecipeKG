I used wakame and arame for sea veggies; hijiki and dulse would work well also. The mint was a nice touch and the coulis whipped up nice and creamy--and so flavorful for such simple ingredients! These were surprisingly easy to put together but I found 30 sec for soaking the rice paper was way too long; about 10 worked for me. You could also toss everything together in a salad if you don't want to use the wraps. Delicious!",
