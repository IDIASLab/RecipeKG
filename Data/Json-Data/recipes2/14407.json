Used 8oz pkg. bacon and par fried in pan removed and sauteed chicken lightly in grease. Put chicken on large bake sheet covered w/ cheddar. Then I topped with par cooked bacon put one pineapple slice on top (small cans have around 4 slices in them.) Then generously sprinkled w/ brown sugar. I baked under broiler until nice and bubbly. Put in a split roll and poured on my favorite bbq sauce. Everyone raved!! Try it this way It's more fattening but oh so good!! Thanks Debbie!",

I'll have to say this was pretty good and if you like ham and pineapple together then this will appeal to your taste buds too. I'd eat it again but it didn't really have any WOW factor. A bit on the dry side though and could use some type of sauce maybe a honey mustard? Thanks this was a nice change of pace for lunch.",
