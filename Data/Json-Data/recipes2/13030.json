I add a bell pepper to mine or other veggies I might have (once some chopped celery). This goes great with bulgogi and roasted seaweed (kim). Btw, you can get Korean red pepper flakes and Korean red pepper paste (gochujang) from Amazon if you don't have an Asian market near you. You can also get the seaweed there!",
