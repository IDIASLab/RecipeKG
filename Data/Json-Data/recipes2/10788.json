I didn't care for the entire mixture being pureed...including the chicken so I pureed 1/2 the soup minus the chicken then added the puree back into the chunky corn onions and chicken pieces for a chunky soup. Heated through and this was fine. It did need salt so we added that while eating. i did use homemade chicken stock so that does have less salt than canned. All in all a good and simple recipe.",
