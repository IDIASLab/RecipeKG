For future reference the noodles are NOT precooked. I did add 1/4 of the jar of sauce and about 6oz. of fresh ricotta cheese to the meat mixture before stuffing the shells. The addition of the bread crumbs wasn't really necessary so I cut the amount used in half. The sauce will cook the shells completely as lond as you keep the dish covered tightly. I hope others enjoy this recipe as much as we did. Also if looking for a real kick, add some pieces of chopped pepperoni to the dish...yummm :-)",

Also just a jar of ragu made it taste mostly like spaghetti. I tried this any way and it was not that tasty noodles were alright just the taste of the other ingredients. Also should have known when the recipe said to cook up the onion and to add breadcrumbs. I will not be making this agian. Just not our taste but I am sure others mite love it. If you are going to make this be very leary of the star rating and the reviews. Almost everyone changed the recipe to add ricotta and eggs or water and such. They did not rate on the acual recipe. I suggest looking elsewhere for a manicotti recipe that actually includes either ricotta or cottage cheese as manicotti is suppose to. I just hate when some one will give a 4 or 5 star rating yet changed the original recipe to where it is a completly different one. Try the original first then rate it! If you dont like it then change it.",
