Make sure you use the reduced sodium soy sauce though -- I almost didn't and was glad that I changed my mind and followed the recipe to the letter.  I think if it were any more salty, it would have been too much.",

We couldn t find grapeseed oil and just used some coconut oil. We didn t add the siracha either because kids. But it didn t need it. We only made 4 servings because our kids haven t been eating much recently. (We have 4 ages 8-4). They devoured it! (All except our 4 year old who refused to try it) they Had multiple helpings. We actually ended up not making enough. Our seven year old asked if we could have it every day. Definitely making again. This will be a recurring dinner. Thank you! Just realized we didn t add garlic and used double the ginger. Will do that in the future because it was wonderful! Side note we also used all organic fresh ingredients.",

Did not add onion or garlic due to diet restrictions. The amount of ginger seemed to me like it would be overpowering so used it but a smaller quantity. I added a half of a package of rice noodles. Added a small amount of purple cabbage since that head was smaller than the napa cabbage at my store. The soup turned out OK not very flavorful given my changes but it is a good base to make chicken noodle soup. Not sure if I will make this again since I could not find key ingredients and do not have an Asian market close by.",
