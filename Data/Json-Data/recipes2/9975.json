Laid the pineapple down in an even layer on the bottom of the pan, then poured the mixture over the top of it. When the cake was done, and cooled, turned it upside down on a platter, and served with fresh strawberries crushed up, and a drizzle of chocolate sauce, with whipped cream. Tasted like I'd slaved for HOURS... SO yummy! Could use sliced bananas in there too, and make it into banana split cake! ",

You can't imagine how happy I was watching my daughter ploughing through her first cupcake.  The only small modification I made was instead of pop, I used sparkling water.
