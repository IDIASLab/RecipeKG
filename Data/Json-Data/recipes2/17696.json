                "reviewBody": "My husband and I enjoyed this recipe quite a bit though the next time I make it (and we agreed that it was definitely tasty enough to ensure there will be a next time - with a few modifications). The only real changes I made this time was adding some orange zest & roasted garlic & onion powders to the sauce as well as the breading mix. For a side dish I just made rice but I used chicken broth instead of water for the rice and added a tablespoon (or so) of orange zest. It came out wonderfully. When I make this next time I'll reduce the oil in the sauce (use less than the 1/4 suggested) it was overpoweringly oily tasting some bites. I'll use frozen concentrated OJ instead of fresh next time to add more orange flavor (and add a bit more to make up for the less oil). I also don't think I reduced the sauce as much as I should have (I did reduce it to half the original but it never seemed to coalesce) so I ll try and be patient. One other odd thing was that the orange slices seemed to soak up a lot of the alcohol in the dish so each bite of the orange itself was a bit overwhelming. I believe the prep timing is off on this recipe (it says 15 minutes but it took that long just to slice and soak the chicken not to mention the breading & frying) I don t think the reduction is taken into account. I was reducing for more than 20 minutes before I got impatient and decided to move things along.",

I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder along with the S&P called for. I could not bring myself to fry this in an entire cup of olive oil so just put a touch of EVOO in the pan sauteed/browned the chicken and it worked fine. Used a pat of butter in place of the missing olive oil for the wine broth OJ reduction. If I make it again I think I'd like to do what reviewer EagleA suggested and use OJ concentrate rather than OJ for more intense orange flavor. Thanks so much for the recipe Nurse24HR!",
