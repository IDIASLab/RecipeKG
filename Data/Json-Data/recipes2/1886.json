I also doubled the meat and blended the diced tomatoes with the paste to make it less chunky (we all love meaty lasagna & none of us like really chunky sauce.) The best part was it took 30 minutes from start to finish when my normal lasagna takes 7-8 hours! I will definitely make it again in the future.",
