I noticed the ounce on the white cake mix I used (and the only ones I could find at my local grocery were less than 18.25 ounces. So I tried the recipe again and use one full box of white cake mix and enough out of a second box to equal the 18.25 ounces the recipe calls for and the batter was perfect texture and it resulted in larger and fluffier cupcakes. The icing is perfect as is. There is no flaw to the recipe that I can find - just that cake mix companies have cut back the amount of batter mix in the boxes. They are delicious and now that I've figured out the reason for the thin batter I will be making these a lot for years to come.",
