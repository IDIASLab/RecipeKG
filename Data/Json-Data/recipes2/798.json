Tip: as olives are very salty and so is some types of bacon you can cut down on the salty taste a bit by soaking the olives in a bowl of water in the fridge for an hour or so prior to making these. I also prefer them backed in the over instead of grilled. I cook them on a rack placed over a cookie sheet which helps cook them evenly all around without the need to turn them they bake nice and stay round (without the \"flat\" bottom things tend to get from sitting directly on a pan) and when raised like this they bake up nicely instead of just sitting in their own grease deep frying. Brushing them lightly near the end with bbq sauce is also VERY good!!:)",
