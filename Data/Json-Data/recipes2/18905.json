I subtracted one minute from the cooking time because you definitely don't want to overcook fish. My daughter didn't like the tilapia but I thought it was delicious (kids can be reluctant to try new dishes especially ones with 'green stuff' so use this recipe for adults unless you have an adventurous kid). I used the version of the recipe for two people and thought that two tablespoons of cider vinegar was just right one for each fish. If you're making more than two servings just pour a tablespoon of vinegar on each fish rather than measuring the total amount. Finally cook it just before serving; don't let it get cold.",

I am always shy about microwave recipes (especially fish) but was really late making dinner and had exactly a pound of tilapia to cook so I was so happy to find this easy recipe. My 4 year old son said no thank you but my 2 year old ate it up & his portion too. The flavor was perfect. When I flipped the fish though there wasn't any liquid to spread over the 2nd side so I basically repeated the recipe with a little less of everything--it was perfect. We did 2 min on one side & 1 1/2 minutes on the other side--perfect. Thanks!",

Like other skeptics I wasn't sure about microwaving fish but I only had a few minutes to come up with something for lunch and I had some tilapia fillets in the fridge. I didn't have any apple cider so I put a splash of lemon juice on each fillet before cooking and fillets were gobbled down by myself and the kids in about the same time it took to cook them! They were especially tasty with fresh tarragon from my garden. My fillets took the full 4 minutes of cooking time but I did check them after flipping them as it seems that other reviewers took only 3 total minutes. Must depend on the thickness of the fillets. I also put a pinch of kosher salt on each fillet after cooking and that made them just perfect.",
