I made a couple substitutions though - I used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Chicken (I'm not sure why all these recipes call for Cream of Chicken - it really doesn't make culinary sense) and since I didn't have any ham prepared, I just used 2 cups of crushed bacon.  I also pretty much doubled the cheese called for an put it all together in a larger pan (probably 11 x 15)  As for mixing the ingredients together and 'pouring' over the eggs... you more or less have to spread it over the eggs - it's not a real pourable mixture.  I think next time I might just mix the eggs in - would have about the same results.  Additionally, an entire 1/4 cup of melted butter isn't needed - this is just too much butter.  Just melt enough butter to douse the top with.",

I also cooked the hasbrowns beforehand and I added green peppers and onions to it. I left out the butter and used shredded cheddar cheese on top instead. I used 8 oz of sour cream instead of 16.

I chopped some red/green bell peppers and mixed them into the hashbrowns.  Then, I poured the soup/egg mixture over the hashbrowns/peppers until coated. Baked a little longer than called for and the result was great.  Served with \"Orange Glorious\" beverage recipe also found on this site and the combo was wonderful! I think sausage may also be a good addition for next time and call me crazy, but maybe even a DASH of cayenne pepper into the soup mix for some kick.  Thanks!",

Mix Cream of MUSHROOM soup (not chicken soup), with ONLY 8 oz of sour cream also adding a little milk (approx 1/4 cup).
