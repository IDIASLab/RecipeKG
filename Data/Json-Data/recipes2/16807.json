When my girl friend and I spent a week at the cottage we planned out a week worth of BBQ recipes from various places around the world. The Quesadillas were simple to make and tasted Great! I would suggest being creative when making them though. Add some red and yellow peppers for example to give them more color. Another piece of advice would be to just lightly oil the ouside of the quesadialls instead of putting the oil on the grill. Thanks for a great contribution. Glen (from Cottage Country) ps/ This recipe can work in the oven too but keep a close eye on them.",
