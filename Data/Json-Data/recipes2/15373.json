It calls for white Zinfandel wine, and has an amazing flavor. It is guaranteed to be one of your favorites, too. This dish goes well with asparagus, and some kind of pasta side (we like to make angel hair pasta with garlic herb butter). Enjoy!!",

However I would recommend using a drier wine (like chardonnay or other white) instead of white zin as the sauce was a bit too sweet. Or I might mix half wine with half chicken broth. I also added a lot of garlic and extra mushrooms which helped. I didn't add the full 3 cups of cheese as I thought that was excessive. I would also recommend adding a bit of cornstarch or cooking the mushroom/wine sauce for 10-15 minutes to let it thicken and possibly adding some chicken boullion for flavor.",

I was confident that they would like this dish after my husband and I had the first portions of the recipe. It is a winner! I followed the recipe - except that I used 6 good sized pieces fo chicken. I put 3 peices each into 2 baking dishes and had enough to share with my neighbors. This note was added after I made this dish the second time. The first time I made this was great...the second time mine came out soggy as others have mentioned...I believe I got over-confident maybe used too much liquid or I had juicier chicken and mushrooms - so I would recommend cutting the liquids a bit. (You can always add more if your dish appears to be on the dry side when you check it but heat the liquids in the microwave before adding so that you don't slow your cooking process.)",
