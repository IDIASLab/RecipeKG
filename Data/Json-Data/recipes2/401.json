Instead of using the grilled and ready chicken, we  marinated a chicken breast in italian dressing and sauteed it in a pan with a little minced garlic. We also added a little minced garlic, onion powder, salt and pepper to the spinach mixture while that was cooking. The result allowed for just the right amount of seasoning/flavor to be mixed throughout the dish. The only change I plan to make next time is to mix the chicken into the spinach/stuffing when I'm adding it to the baking dish so the entire dish melds a little more.",
