I made this as listed except for the ponzu butter sauce, which terrified me a little with the amount of fat involved. O.o I used 1/2&1/2 instead of heavy cream, and cut the 1/2cup of cold butter to 1/4 cup. Still VERY flavorful and creamy.   I also didn't have ponzu sauce so I made my own: 3 parts soy sauce, 2 parts vinegar, 1 part orange juice and 1/2 part sesame oil.   Most of the work here is prep, with the actual cooking taking very little time. Make sure to get the ponzu butter to the stage where you're reducing by half before you throw the salmon in the skillet to sear, if you want things to come out done all at about the same time. =)",

I agree with Jimmy D Fireguy needs to make the whole recipe and Jimmy D the cucumber salad was amazing and really added to the dish - you guys need to make the whole thing. My guests loved the salmon and I would definitely make the dish again. My husband seared two whole salmon fillets (48 oz - giving me 12 x 4oz fillets) on the grill for me and then I rubbed them with the honey and ginger crust. The crust didn't crisp up for me either but the flavours of it just soaked into the salmon. I would recommend using less peanut oil. Also if cooking for a smaller number stick to 8oz per person - the original recipe works with 4 x 8oz portions - as it's so yummy a smaller portion of 4 oz is not enough! The ponzu butter was to die for! The 4 stages means a little bit of work but this recipe is truly worth it.",
