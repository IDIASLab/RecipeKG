The flavor is subtle and delectable and is suited to a variety of breads or crackers. I usually make it in small batches using the 4- or 5-oz packages of chevre because there are usually just the two of us! It is a perfect accompaniment to a glass of wine before dinner. When my youngest granddaughter sees it now she just goes nuts because she can hardly wait for tastes! I could never thank Celeste enough for aiding my new addiction to meyer lemon olive oil--could never be without it! And this is a perfect way to use it!",

It was pretty good straight from the package, but I hoped to do something more with it. I found this recipe!!! Since I had no lemon- infused olive oil I just added some lemon zest and about 1/2t lemon juice.  Only about half of it made it into the refrigerator to chill, and if I hadn't spoken severely to myself, none of it would have gotten there!  Spread on toast and topped with sliced strawberries and/or blueberries, it is to die for.  So now the other half is in my fridge, calling out to me.......",
