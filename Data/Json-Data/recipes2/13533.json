I added some extras to the honey-mustard sauce and thought of making the white wine sauce while the salmon was cooking. My wife, who hates fish, not only loved it, but asked me to make it again the next day. Needless to say, we've found a way to bring fish into our home. Green beans and wild rice is a great side for this salmon. Serve with lemon wedges.",

I did not have honey mustard so I used a teaspoon of yellow mustard and a teaspoon of honey. Alas I did not have enough of the sauce left over to make the wine sauce but will definitely plan to make it next time. I cooked the fish in my Waring toaster oven on broil with great results. Fish was moist and perfectly cooked. I look forward to making this again. Thanks for the recipe.",
