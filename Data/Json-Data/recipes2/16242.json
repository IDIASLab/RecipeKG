I used Maytag blue cheese instead of the Gorgonzola. My second change was proportions of sauce to pasta. I ended up doing 3/4 of all sauce ingredients but instead of doing 3/4 of the pasta----I did 1/2 pound pasta and this entree was perfect for 2. In other words a little more sauce to pasta ratio. I also want you to know that the entire sauce can be made WELL in advance. At serving I cooked the pasta and tossed it with the sauce over heat---Too tasty for words. Thank you so much for sharing. More recipes please!",

I am a huge fan of gorgonzola and this is the best vehicle for gorgonzola I've ever had. When I have added those other ingredients I simply double the cheese and balsamic vinegar so the flavors don't get too diluted. And I've even managed to find a way to eat the arugula that is so plentiful in season around here but is normally too bitter for my taste. I simply add the fresh chopped arugula in the last step and the heat of the pasta wilts it nicely.",

That may have been because I used 8 oz. of gorgonzola rather than 4. I added crushed red pepper and julienned sun-dried tomatoes. It was extremely flavorful. I had this for dinner last night and have already had 2 more servings today! And I NEVER eat lunch! I served this over vermicelli. Thanks for a wonderful recipe and thanks other reviewers for ideas. In the future I might add some good olives.",

                "reviewBody": "Fantastic! I have now made this twice and although I think it is delicious as is I think it is AMAZING with a couple changes - one rather weird-sounding. First - actually caramelize the onions. You cannot caramelize onions in only 10 minutes - sauteed onions are different from caramelized onions. This recipe really benefits from truly caramelized onions which need to be cooked more slowly over a relatively low heat. Caramelized onions becomes wonderfully sweet - it's sort of amazing that you can get such a flavor from a regular onion (and I did use regular yellow onions.) The sweetness off-sets the gorgonzola cheese and I think that many people who did not like the recipe might like it if they truly caramelized the onions. Also - the second time I made this I added a lot of sea salt to the cooking onions and then took a page from a pork chop recipe I think I invented - I mixed a LOT of balsamic vinegar (much more than called for) apple juice and a bit more sea salt with the cooked onions and let it reduce while still over heat. This is quite a departure from the recipe but it added a wonderful sweet-savory flavor which went well with the cheese. It does not end up tasting like apple juice at all and it also adds a bit more liquid. I also mixed the pasta/sauce with the cheese very well while it was still warm so the cheese melted completely forming just a creamy coating and added chopped almonds for crunch and a subtle flavor. SO good.",
