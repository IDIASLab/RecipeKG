I only used half the cheese all in my attempt to make this a little healthier. I was disappointed at first because it was very soupy and incredibly hot! letting it sit for 20 minutes is better after taking it out of the oven. then it set and had a wonderful flavor. will make it again will make a great pot luck dish!",
