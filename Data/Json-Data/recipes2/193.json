I served it with wild rice and a green salad I used four lamb shanks and it fed my family of 6 very well they just loved it! I didn t have any red wine so I used white wine instead. I also added an additional Tbsp if flour to the gravy at the end to make it just a bit thicker. I initially didn t think the sauce was going to be good but I just trusted the recipe and poured it over the lamb shanks and baked it for a couple hours. When the meat and the sauce cook together it just produces the most delicious gravy you ve ever tasted. This recipe is a keeper for sure!",
