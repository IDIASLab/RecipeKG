The combination of flavors is excellent!   The only small issue I had was that, because I used a regular tomato in addition to the fresh spinach, the pizza toppings were watery when I pulled it from the oven.  This was remedied with a few paper towels.  I think this would have been better had I used smaller, Roma tomatoes and if I had allowed the slices to sit for several minutes after being cut to let some of their juice drain.  My husband & daughter loved it, as did I, and we will have it again soon!",

I made a couple of changes: sauteed the onion first used bagged spinach since that is what I had on hand added sliced green olives and used fresh mozzarella (approx. 8oz) rather than feta. The \"sauce\" would be excellent as a dip for hot crusty bread!! Thank you for this new and easy variation on the traditional pizza!",
