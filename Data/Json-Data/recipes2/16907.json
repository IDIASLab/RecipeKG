I knew this before I tried the recipe but decided to trust the recipe for some reason. Bad idea! After 10 minutes most of the liquid was gone the rice was far from being done and the rice was sticking to the bottom of the pan and beginning to burn. I had to add more water (didn't have any more pineapple juice) and simmer rice until it was done. I didn't care for the flavor but by the time I went to eat it I was thoroughly disgusted with the recipe for having the incorrect liquid-to-rice ratio and incorrect simmering time and disappointed in myself for following the recipe and not my own instincts and this may have tainted my judgment of the flavor.",

Not this time though. I knew that 10 minutes would not be long enough to cook the rice so I cooked it for the traditional 20 minutes. When I removed the pan lid I found the hard rice all stuck to the bottom of the pan and the pineapple juice bubbling merrily away on the top. I hurriedly scraped the bottom of the pan and the rice wasn't burnt just a bit toasty so I covered the pan and cooked it for another 10 minutes. By that time the rice had absorbed most of the juice but it was blown-out and gluey. I didn't care for the flavors either. Between this recipe and another unsuccessful recipe from this site dinner last night was a disaster. Sorry.",

The rice came out cooked to perfection. I must say that as curry lovers my husband and I found this to have a bit too much curry. I will make it again but reduce the curry by at least half. For those of you who have a problem with rice sticking to the pan make sure you reduce heat to as low as possible. If you still have problems coat your pan with a tad of vegi oil though in this recipe the butter should help.",
