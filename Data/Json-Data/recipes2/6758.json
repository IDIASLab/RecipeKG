Fantastic with a standing rib roast!  Also try this, my favorite with this reduction! Carmalize fresh sliced mushrooms and thinly sliced red onions in a little butter and olive oil. Spoon over steak or roast slices and pour some reduction over all. Yum!",

I ended up with about a cup.  I couldn't throw out the veggies, so I threw some pecans, cream cheese, parm and seasoning in them, took out my Cuisinart stick and made two veggie \"pates\" that my 14 year old and 18 year old approved of.
