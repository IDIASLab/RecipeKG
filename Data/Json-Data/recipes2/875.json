I have a 5 litre jar with this ready in house always.  I use this cup-for-cup in cakes, cookies and sweets.  For crepes I take away two tablespoons adding buckwheat flour to the mix.  For savoury and bread recipes that I am converting I typically use 3/4 cup of this mix to 1 cup regular wheat flour adding 1/3 cup of another flour (sorghum, millet, quinoa or similar) because it adds some flavour and nutrients.
