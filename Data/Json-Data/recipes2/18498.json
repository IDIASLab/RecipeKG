After browning the pork in the skillet I added the following; 2 t cumin, 1 t garlic, 3 T fresh cilantro, half of one small onion sliced and 3 t lime juice. After simmering to meld the flavors I added 1 small can corn and 1 small can black beans. Topped with cheese, green onions, sour cream and homemade salsa on a fresh warmed tortilla. Next time I will have avocado sliced as well...yum! With these few additions, this recipe went from Good to Awesome!! Thanks for the post!",

If I had little ones I might leave it as written but I was pressed for time and didnt want to search anymore so decided I too would add my own spices. 5 pork steaks was a lot to fry up in my pan which was fairly large but once finished in stages I combined them all back together and seasoned up once more. I kept my sauted onions & peppers on the side as well as the picante cheese sour cream and refried beans. I did add some green onion for a splash of pretty color. It came together in a decent time frame and everyone enjoyed it. Will I make it again? I am not sure. I like beef but this might be good for pork night when I forget to marinate the roast again. However it was a nice little recipe that didnt take too long or too complicated. Thank you for sharing.",
