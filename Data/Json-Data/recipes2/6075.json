I used Pillsbury Pizza Crust 2/3c mayonnaise and 2 c shredded mozzarella plus the other ingred. listed in the recipe. I preheated oven to 400 degrees.After the dough was rolled on the pan I sprinkled 1 c of the shredded mozzarella over it. Mixed the other cup of mozzarella parmesan basil mayo and garlic in a bowl. Placed 4 thinly sliced Plum tomatoes on top of the mozz/crust then scooped mixture over the tomatoes and baked 20 minutes til golden and bubbly. Easy and oh so good!",
