Then did final mix. -- For toppings: sprinkle more of the sesame seeds and some chopped /roasted peanuts or hazel nuts. I didn't have a bottle of Asian-style dressing sitting around so I made my own: low sodium soy sauce rice vinegar sesame oil & chili oil. Will make again. Thanks!",

Big thanks to those who post recipes like this and help a girl out!\nI appreciate the base recipe, but I also enjoy its versatility.  For tonight's version I replaced the carrots and water chestnuts with 1 - 1 1/2 C coleslaw mix (a fancy kind with Brussels sprouts and kale bits).  I made my own Asian dressing yesterday (added the crushed red pepper in this part), this helped control the sodium and sugar.   We enjoyed the wraps this way but also with fresh slices of Mandarin oranges added to the individual wraps.  \nNext time I will add crushed cashews or, as the note suggests, almonds.\nMy vegetable hating brother loves this, so it's in the rotation for good.   \nThanks again!",
