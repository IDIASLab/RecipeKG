My only suggestion is I baked mine for 15-20 instead of frying them after tasting the first few fried ones and though they were greasy. Also try using the cranberry sauce as a dipping sauce or even gravy.",

When I tasted the filling before they were cooked I wasn't sure if people would like them. However after they were fried they were really good. I have tried baking and frying wonton and the taste is so much better if you take the time to fry. It's a big difference. The easiest way is to put about 1/4 inch of oil in a skillet and let them fry for a minute on each side.",

I also put them all out with cranberry sauce and gravy. I definately do love the idea behind it all tho.
