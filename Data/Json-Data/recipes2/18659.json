                "reviewBody": "This is a breakfast staple in the Philippines. It is usually eaten as you would have bread accompany your meals.  It is normally served to accompany Filipino sausages (with as many varieties as there are regions in the country), thin slices of  fried beef (called tapa) or sweet pork (tocino), or fried fish...even corned beef, luncheon meat, or chicken/pork adobo, for breakfast.  Most times, slices of tomatoes and cucumber or pickled vegetables are served on the  side while the fried meat or fish is dipped in vinegar and minced raw garlic, with salt and black pepper.\nThe garlic rice, therefore, need no meats in them. It is not the basic \"sinangag\" (as it is called locally) Basic is the garlic. \nThe best to use is day-old cooked rice. When the rice becomes hard in the fridge, just wet your hands and mash the rice to crumble when ready to cook. The finished product is not supposed to be wet but toasted. That is why it has to be \"dried\" for at least a day in the fridge. That is why it is really called Garlic Fried Rice. Season to taste with salt and pepper and/or enhance further with meat powder while cooking.  \nTurn heat off only when you are satisfied with the consistency achieved.\nBasically though, except for the pork added, this is the way this dish is done by Filipinos.",

IN MY OPINION... don't measure the garlic... put aLOT.... tastes much better... a quick tip is not to make your heat too hot or else your garlic wil burn quickly... usually when my garlic is just starting to brown on the edges i go ahead and put the rice in and it will still brown nicely while you mix up the rice..... i prefer lots of garlic and regular salt to using a little fresh garlic and using garlic salt...... but everyone's version will be different.....",

I chopped up the pork and used way more than two tablespoons. I also added some chopped green onion to the mix. I swapped the white rice for brown rice and I used pre-minced garlic from a jar. However even with those changes this recipe turned out fantastic! The only thing my husband had to add was some crushed red pepper since he likes things spicy! And usually he adds a ton of salt and pepper to whatever I make. I highly recommend this recipe for using up leftover pork!",
