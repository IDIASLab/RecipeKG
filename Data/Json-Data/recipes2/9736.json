As the submitter of this recipe I would like to note that I have also used Greek vanilla yogurt and regular unstrained vanilla yogurt too just reducing the amount to 1 cup. I don't usually have actual half-n-half and sub 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup 2% milk instead. So when it's hot outside just keep a can of sweetened condensed milk in the fridge then everything is cold enough to whip this up on a whim and it's great as soft-serve even before ripening in the freezer. I have not tried \"sugar free\" drink mix I would expect that has an artificial sweetener? I have tried a few other (unsweetened) Kool-Aid flavors black cherry is good lemon is very tart and we also liked strawberry but orange is the best!:)",
