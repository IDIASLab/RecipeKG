I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the garlic is a bit harsh--next time I'd just cook them a bit with the eggplant to address that. I don't eat mayo so I used hummus instead and mixed the garlic in with the hummus. It was yummy for me that way! Bf doesn't like eggplant so I made all three for me.:o) Delicious and now I have an excellent sandwich for my packed lunch tomorrow! thank you for the recipe!",
