I was intrigued so finally tried it and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it another way. I did add a tiny onion to it and coated them in Italian bread crumbs instead of flour but wow. This will be my go to. And the reviewer that used fresh salmon and tuna def use the canned. I can see why it would be dry. This recipe is not meant for that. Cheap and easy comfort food. Thank you so much for a new twist on salmon patties. I\u2019ll use this over and over.",
