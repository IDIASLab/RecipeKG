Then I added the tomatoes onion garlic 6 chicken andouille sausage links (didn't have/want a ham hock) cumin red pepper flakes and Monterey Steak Seasoning and simmered for 30 minutes. Definately something to consider for holiday giving. But I will add extra seasoning to the gift package (separated from the beans of course since you have to soak them).",

I couldn't find dried soybeans anywhere so I simply weighed the remaining 11 bean mix and made sure I had at least 2 cups of beans in every container.  I put the beans in a holiday cellophane bag with the recipe attached to the top.  I had several friends comment that they haven't made this soup in years and they were looking forward to trying it again.  One thing I noticed that the directions omit is the fact that you need to cut up the meat off the ham hock and add it to the pot after you've simmered the beans for 1 hour.",
