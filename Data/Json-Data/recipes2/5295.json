I watched the video several times before starting and had all my ingredients ready. my nuts were toasted and kept in a warm oven. I stirred the entire time as directed. \n\nwhen I added my soft peak egg whites, I continued to cook and although my mixture got thicker, it never turned white. it just stayed a milky honey color. I did do the water test and removed it after the specified time anyway- added nuts and  poured it into the pan with the wafer paper. \n\nwhen cool, my torrone was ROCK hard.  of course if you broke it into little bits- the taste was good, but it was really difficult to eat.  you could break your teeth, it was so hard. \n\nso, this recipe was a disappointing fail for me. the end result was definitely NOT traditional torrone. I think it would be wise for chef john to rewrite the recipe with temperatures using a candy thermometer, so more people could experience success. \n\n(and he also never specified in the recipe, or the video, when to add the extra tablespoons of sugar listed in the ingredients list. in reading other torrone recipes, it\u2019s added after the eggs reach soft peak.).",

However, and this is important:  I watched the video numerous times, then I read every comment, and from that I was able to avoid mistakes.  Biggest secret, which I learned in the comments:  you MUST use a heavy-bottomed pan.  I used my soup pot, which has that heavy bottom.  This was crucial.  And accept the fact that this takes a while, and stir, stir, stir.   The only result that was different than John's was that, once I had added the egg whites, it reached the point of doneness in about half the time it took his.  However, the ribbon test and water test both said I was there, I trusted that and added my warm nuts.\nFor storage, I came up with the idea that worked best.  I cut pieces of wax paper into smaller squares and wrapped each piece individually.  Took a few minutes, but then I was able to put them all in a large tupperware container (a zip lock bag would also work here) and they stayed fresh and perfect for the entire week it took for us to eat them all.  Plus, I could put a handful of them out with the other Christmas cookies, and they looked kinda neat wrapped in wax paper.",
