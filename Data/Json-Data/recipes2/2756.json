A few hours later I easily combined all the ingredients in my Kitchen Aid. The frosting came together very nicely, but, after using almost the entire box of confectionary sugar I felt that it was becoming sweet enough. (I'll guess-timate that I left about four tablespoons in the box.) Then, when I went to frost my nine inch two layer cake I found the chocolate mixture to be very stiff and even with applying it gently I was still pulling up some pieces of cake. So, before I went any further I added two more tablespoons of milk and incorporated that thoroughly into my mixture. The sweetness was evened out and the texture was just right for spreading. I had enough to generously frost in-between my two layers, the sides and top of the cake with a fair amount left over. All in all the taste was very good, I just think the proportions are slightly off on the amount of sugar and milk needed. It is good to know that you don't actually have to use the entire sixteen ounces of sugar yet there will still be plenty of frosting for even three nine inch layers.",
