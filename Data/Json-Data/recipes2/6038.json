It beats any honey mustard dressing you will buy or try on this site- the seasoning's make a huge difference most of the other dressings are missings something. Some tips: 1. The type/brand of mustard makes a huge difference. My favorite is grey poupon's course ground dijon mustard. 2. I also use light mayo (kraft or hellmans). 3. You can also sub 1/4-1/2 the mayo with olive oil for a slightly different taste. 4. I also add garlic powder..around a Tablespoon because I love garlic! Fresh garlic would be even better but I'm lazy.",

This works well with fat free mayo, too- just make sure you whisk it well to get rid of the lumps.  Once I substituted agave nectar for the honey, and that made the dressing quite a bit sweeter.

The only tweak I made to it was to decrease the apple cider vinegar to 1/4 cup so the dressing is a little thicker and not so vinegary. I like it the original way but my kids like the variation. What I absolutely think is genius is the lime zest it really makes this dressing unique and was why I tried it in the first place. We think it's the bee's knees!",
