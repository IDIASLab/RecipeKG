Tweaks for the next time would be: 1) hold off on the bell pepper and replace with something more traditionally Chinese, like bok choy, snow peas, etc and I would NOT boil the heck out of the veggies, but that's to each his own!  2) I added another cup of chicken broth or even water might lighten it up a bit, 3) flavor was a bit bland so I added a smidge of extra soy sauce and fish sauce and. . .hello! 4) I would leave the ramen noodles whole, more fun for the kids to slurp.",

As a dollar general employee when I get off work there\u2019s no meat at grocery stores so I made this buying stuff at work with my 30% employee coupon on clover valley stuff. Used 2 cans of chicken, can of carrots and mixed veggies drained (only way I could get celery in it), an onion I had at home, garlic powder not fresh, and ramen noodles. I didn\u2019t use broth just water so I used the seasoning packs included in the noodles and added some butter. No peppers here so couldn\u2019t use it but kept everything else the same seasoning wise.  I tripled it for my family and we got 2 great dinners from it for under $5. Thank you. Having to get creative to feed my family now and this was well received.",
