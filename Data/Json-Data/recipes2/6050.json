Although I did make a few changes (everyone does!), this is a wonderful recipe! \n\nFirst, I smashed my beans rather than using a processor. I prefer the texture this way. \nI omitted the liquid smoke as I'm not a fan. Instead, I reserved some of the juice from the beans. I added about 1/8 cup to the mixture for consistency. \n\nI also substituted panko for bread crumbs, and cut that back to a cup. \n\nLastly, I cooked and added a 1/4 c. quinoa.  My jalape\u00f1o and onion were cooked with the quinoa, then cooled for a bit before adding to mixture. \n\nI had no trouble at all forming these into patties- great consistency. I chilled the mixture in the fridge for about ten minutes while I put my daughter to bed- but it was not necessary to chill.",
