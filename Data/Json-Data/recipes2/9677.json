It's great in coffee, over ice cream, or on its own.  It's also wonderful as a grown-up frozen dessert; just pour some into your ice-cream maker and freeze as directed.  Because of the alcohol, it will not freeze very firm, but it still works nicely.  Try it as a family-appropriate dessert by omitting the whiskey.",

Does the \"G' version require additional liquid to make up for the loss of 750 m/l whiskey?",
