Absolutely incredible spices- sweet hot cinnamon- yum! Hands down best butternut squash soup we've ever made. Give it a try!",

I followed these directions with a few minor tweaks due to allergies. I can't use onions or certain spices so I had to substitute. I added fresh basil cinnamon fresh thyme fresh garlic dried rosemary and pears that were just picked fresh off the tree. After the squash finished roasting and it was all together and simmering on the stove I added a 8 oz package of lo-fat cream cheese. When the cream cheese had all melted and blended in I let the soup cool a bit before I put it through my food processor. The soup was super creamy and ultra delicious!! The bacon (I doubled this amount) on top was a pure delight who doesn't love bacon after all!!! I am so glad that I took a chance and made lots because it will be such a tummy warmer on those cold wintry nights! Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!!",

I used turkey bacon so I didn t have the bacon drippings; saut\u00e9ed the onions in olive oil instead. The bacon gave it an interesting taste that grew on me as I simmered and tasted. I added about 2 Tbsp. of hickory smoked BBQ sauce; a great flavor addition which my husband loved. Before adding the BBQ sauce I thought the rosemary and thyme were a little strong but after adding the BBQ sauce it was less noticeable. I did not have ground dried chipotle pepper so I just used a tsp. of some hot sauce. And I only had one green pear; used about of it in the soup and that worked fine. Before serving instead of sour cream I topped with the cubes of the remaining pear and chopped pecans. If I had not portioned out in serving bowls I believe we would have consumed the entire pot in one sitting. There is such a variety of flavors. Excellent and satisfying on a cold winter day!",
