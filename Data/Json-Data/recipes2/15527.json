I made a few minor tweaks - used cavatappi noodles added extra garlic a splash of Worcestershire sauce and some leftover frozen shrimp I had. It would have been just as good without the shrimp. Also topped it off with a couple of handfuls of mozzarella before baking. After tasting the final outcome I think this would also be good with portabellas and/or a pesto sauce mixed in.

I did add a bit of salt and pepper as well but I thought it had great flavor; not bland at all. I can't wait until lunch tomorrow to have more and to schedule a dinner party so I can show it off!
