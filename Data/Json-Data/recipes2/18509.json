I already had some onions peppers and tomatoes seasoned in Salad Seasoning Supreme that I threw in the salad. I topped it with smoked gouda cheese and crumbled some Melba Toast on top for crunch and used a sweet vidalia onion dressing. I know I didn't follow the recipe exact but it is very versatile and needed some cheese. Everything is better with cheese. I look forward to having left over steak now so I can have a good lunch the next day. Thanks for great recipe.",

I don't eat onions or tomatoes yuck so I left them off. Hubby didn't miss them anyway. I used chunky bleu cheese dressing on my salad while hubby used ranch as stated. Just a grind or two of fresh pepper and we were ready to eat! What a great way to stretch a steak as this fed two of us easily on 1 t-bone. A great way to still enjoy steak even on a budget.",
