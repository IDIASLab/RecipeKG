                "reviewBody": "It's true that haldi ka doodh is a traditional drink, but this recipe has a couple of major errors that will make it ineffective.  In ayurvedic medicine honey is NEVER cooked.  EVER.  If you must use it, add it after the drink has cooled a few minutes.  All sugar is processed, even honey.  It was simply processed by bees. There are mystery ingredients ion honey, yes.  But they should not be cooked according to ayurvedic medicine.   Just use regular cane sugar.  Also, the kind of milk used absolutely matters.  It must be whole cow's milk from a pastured animal, and it must be boiled.  The LAST ingredient you ever want to use is coconut.  It has the opposite effect of all the other ingredients, and will render their medicinal propertires useless.  If you are having a problem believing this, just ask yourself if you think an American blogger has done five thousand years worth of study, observation and testing before swapping out ingredients, or if she did it because she heard coconut milk was really trendy...  Coconut milk is good, but not in a recipe such as this.  Ever.  If you don't drink cow's milk, go spend five thousand years on your own medicinal beverage, and leave this one alone.",
