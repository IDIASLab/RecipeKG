You may eat this right away by making a sandwich with coleslaw or however you choose, but it is best to let it sit overnight in the refrigerator. Then, reheat it. This is especially important if you do not have a slow cooker and choose to cook it in a skillet instead.",

If made right, this can even make non-vegetarians wonder if it\u2019s really pork or not. I used the 2 of the Trader Joe\u2019s canned jackfruit in brine and a bottle of TJs Kansas City bbq sauce. An important thing to stress when using the canned jackfruit is that you dry it out as much as possible before cooking. I rinsed and drained it, then let it sit for a few hours to let the excess drain off before putting it in the fridge overnight to let it dry further. Then before cooking squeeze any more water out of it with your hands. I didn\u2019t dry rub it, but I added a couple of tablespoons of smoked paprika while I cooked on the stovetop, which gives it a nice flavor. Definitely add some water if you have thick bbq sauce in the slow cooker.  Finally, after it has cooked use a fork to break the jackfruit apart before eating, since the chunks aren\u2019t as tasty.",
