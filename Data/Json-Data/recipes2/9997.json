After being in the oven for 30 minutes the potatoes were done the bacon was no where near cooked and they were floating in a pool of bacon grease and butter. I finished cooking the bacon in a pan and crisped up the potatoes with some onions and seasonings in the bacon grease. I then placed on a paper towel to soak up the grease and served them topped with bacon and green onions. The end results were very good but we would not have been able to eat them as written in the recipe.",
