I don\u2019t have a good processer but used my vita mix because I don\u2019t have a food processor. Using the \u201ctamper\u201d that came with the blender helped the mixture from turning into a big clump during blending. I put the beer in first with the paprika, then the shredded cheese, then the cream cheese and the corn starch last. Super smooth. After you\u2019re done put hot water and a squirt of dish soap in the blender and let it clean itself. Super easy yummy appetizer! Thanks for sharing.",
