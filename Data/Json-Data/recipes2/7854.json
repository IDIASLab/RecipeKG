                "reviewBody": "I have always made gnocchi by baking the potatoes first. I'd remove them from the oven and immediately cut in half lengthwise to allow the steam to escape. When ready to handle I'd then scoop out the insides and spread on the counter to allow more moisture to escape. This recipe worried me a bit given it directs boiling the potatoes. After they were ready I placed the whole potatoes on a cutting board and once cool enough to touch I used my vegetable peeler to remove all the skins then cut in half as usual and allowed them to release steam. I don't have a ricer so I used a large grater to grate the potatoes directly onto my counter top. Because I was having friends for dinner who are GF I used gluten free flour as a one-for-one replacement in this recipe. Doing so meant I had to continue to add more GF flour and potato starch to help the dough become more dry and tacky. Also used one egg and one egg yolk mixed together to try to cut down on the wetness of an additional egg white. Everything mixed very well together and from there the directions are perfect. When I pan-seared the gnocchi after boiling I used a small amount of olive oil in which I warmed fresh thyme to help release the herb's flavor. I also added some slices of bacon before tossing in the gnocchi. It was PERFECT. To get the ridges on the gnocchi after cutting the dough into 1\" squares roll each piece against the backside of a fork's tines. This is a time-consuming recipe but if you make this batc",

The russet potatoes were not cooked enough after 35 minutes which made them lumpy even after I used my vitamix to soften and blend. The dough required 2 extra cups of flour because it was so sticky this in turn made the gnocchi very dense as opposed to fluffy and light.
