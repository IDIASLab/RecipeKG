Cotija cheese is a salty, hard cheese available in the Hispanic section of many grocery stores.  It is similar to feta which could be used as a substitute in this recipe. But cotija is getting easier to find and makes this recipe more authentic!",

Before I added the cheese (I used oaxaca instead of cotija and it worked beautifully) I added a little of the beef to each chile. I roughly chopped the onion instead of slicing it (just a preference) and it tasted nearly identical to the chiles I get in my favorite Mexican restaurant! (Oh just a warning...if you're not used to working with chiles you may want to wear disposable gloves. On the scale of hotness poblanos aren't that bad but can still cause some discomfort if you get a hot one and have sensitive skin and/or eyes.) This recipe is a winner and I'm sure I'll make it again (perhaps adding a little cilantro to the tomato/onion/sour cream/cumin mixture). Yumm-oh!",
