I used pineapple tidbits and dotted each one with honey before I closed them up. Also next time I would roll or press out the triangles a bit first just to get a bit more room. When folding fold the point of the triangle over the wider part flip it over and fold the sides in then wrap and press the tip of the triangle around the rest of the package. That seemed to work the best. I didn't think they were soggy like a previous reviewer but I also cooked them at 375 for 11 minutes hoping to avoid that problem. Thanks for the recipe!",

Then I cut the chicken into pieces and mixed it with crushed pineapple ginger and honey. I didn't spread the juice on the dough but instead I put some sliced Pepper Jack cheese down then put the chicken pineapple mixture. This helped with the \"soggy\" issue. Once I sealed them up I placed more Pepper Jack on top. It added a good kick to the Bites. All in all my husband and I really enjoyed this dish!",
