This was just sweet enough and didn't leave me or my dinner guests feeling heavy afterwards (as most desserts do). While I enjoyed this I do prefer TABKAT's strawberry angel food dessert a tad better - but only because I like that the strawberries in hers are coated with yummy glaze.:) NOTE: To help control portion sizes and for a fancier presentation I made individual trifles. I layered all ingredients in stemless wine glasses and garnished with a sprig of fresh basil (too cute!). I also used all fat-free ingredients and no one could tell the difference. I will DEFINITELY be adding this to my \"keeper\" file for sure. Thanks for sharing your yummy recipe Michellelauren!:-)",
