First, I grilled strips of chicken breasts instead of cubed chicken using my George Foreman (took 5 min!) and then when layering it, I added spoonfuls of salsa over the rice.  I also used cheddar instead of jack, and it worked very well. I ate mine with sour cream and extra salsa.  This has a fajita casserole taste to it, which isn't my hubby's favorite thing but he liked it, especially in the times I have made it since, where I chop the peppers and onion up smaller so they're less noticeable. Even my toddler daughter eats it!",

Two cups of rice didn't seem to be enough.  I still used the same amount of milk and cream of mushroom soup.  The thing that made the big difference was that I added a package of taco seasoning to my chicken before I added the soup and milk.  I made it a second time and added a can of diced green chilies.  Sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top of the monterey jack.  Try it this way and you will love it.  A good recipe to play with and change around. Thanks.",
