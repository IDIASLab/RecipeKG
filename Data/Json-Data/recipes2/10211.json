I did add a couple of things because I like my beans extra spicy.  1.5 tsp Red pepper flakes, 14 oz  kielbasa sausage, dash cayenne pepper,  1/ 2 tsp black pepper,  and because Rice and Beans needs some sort of tomato --- 1   15oz  can tomato sauce. I served over basmati rice and it was heaven.  ***** If you like your beans to be on the soft side, add a few extra minutes to the time*****",

I mean I cannot cook beans that I fall in love with or that are really edible.  I love other peoples beans but mine never come out right.  I also have a bit of a pet peeve for reviewers who change everything about a recipe and then rate the one they didn't make.  I did listen to a couple of the reviews though as I like softer beans. I cooked for 45 minutes instead of 30.  I used fresh veggies as that's what I had on hand and I did add 1 tbsp of chili pepper.  I also had one small ham hock in the freezer which I threw in.  Now I'm sounding like the reviewers I mentioned above.  Sorry about that.  I don't think I changed anything enough to change the outcome though.  These beans were absolutely AMAZING!!!  I think the author really nailed it.  These were hands down the best beans I have made in my life. The flavor was spot on.  I can't say enough about it.  We will definitely be using this recipe over and over again.  Thank you to the author for taking the time to post this recipe.",

The biggest complaint was the sausage became \"squishy\" They liked the actual flavor and the beans. The squishy meat may be user error. I did not soak my beans and used another reviewers suggestion and pressure cooked for 1.5hours. My beans were perfectly cooked. I also doubled the meat because my family loves smoked sausage. I used red bell pepper because that is what I had on hand a stalk of celery and half a vidalia onion (couldn't find the mix at the store) and vegetable broth.",

I combined this recipe with other from this site that uses a traditional stovetop long cook approach (Authentic New Orleans Red Beans and Rice).  The combination was fantastic!   Changes I made to this recipe included some suggested by others:  bacon grease instead of olive oil,  added 7.5 oz tomato sauce ( and some extra salt and black pepper because of it ), 1/2 tsp each sage and thyme, 1 TBsp Cajun seasoning ( Tony Cachere\u2019s), 1 lb Polska Kielbasa sausage cut up, a dash of cayenne and 2 smoked ham hocks. I used fresh onion, celery and bell pepper, not frozen, but that probably doesn\u2019t change anything.  Remove bay leaves and ham hocks after cooking but be sure to take the little bit of meat off the ham hocks and add back in, really makes a difference!  I had to add 15 minutes to the cook time.  So worth it.  Give this one a try!",
