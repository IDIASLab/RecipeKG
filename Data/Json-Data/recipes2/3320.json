I used blood oranges, strawberries, bananas and a little pineapple I had leftover from some fruit salad.  You can truly use any combination of fruits you may have on hand.  I also used a little vanilla almond milk in place of the ice, honey and extract.  Flax seeds would add to the texture creating silkiness, once pureed, but I chose to use almond bran to up the fiber considerably.  Small adaptations to a great base recipe.",
