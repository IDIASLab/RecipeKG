After mixing everything together and even sticking them in the fridge for an hour I could see that they were still going to be too wet. Easy fix though because I just added a handful of breadcrumbs and that firmed them up real nice. I topped mine with salsa instead of the typical ketchup and I used A-1 bold and spicy for the steak sauce and we really liked them. Thanks!",

And it broke a little but I was super careful when I flipped. So it\u2019s not going so good. Lol! I put it on a bun and topped it with saut\u00e9ed onions and jalape\u00f1os, and took a bite and it was absolutely amazing. The flavor exploded in my mouth and it was the best burger I have ever ate!!!!! My family absolutely loved it! We couldn\u2019t stop raving about it! Because the flavor was just that amazing. We are definitely going to make these again next week! Maybe I\u2019ll follow  some of the other reviews that used egg or something to hold the burger together. But this burger is a winner in my book because the taste is the most flavorful burger I\u2019ve ever had!!!!! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!!!",
