I never would have thought to use taco seasoning but it was all I had and I went for it. It turned out excellent. This was very impressive and one I will make time and time again. The radicchio adds such an extra touch and class. Loved it!",

Maybe add blackened or cajun seasoning to the fish or some spice to the pico de gallo? If I were to make this again I would switch out the radicchio for another type of lettuce leaf because it left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth after every bite which was unpleasant.",
