I made a smaller batch, but I think it would work out to about a tablespoon for the full recipe, but just salt to taste.   Other than that, it's a great way to use up green tomatoes that have succumbed to blossom end rot or early frost.  I used hotter peppers than the recipe, didn't use bell peppers, but omitted the cayenne, as I don't like powders in fresh salsa.  I don't feel it would be too hot for most people, but definitely has heat, and the heat intensifies the longer the salsa ages, so keep that in mind for the faint of heart.",
