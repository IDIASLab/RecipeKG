I made my own Alfredo because I'm not a fan of the jarred stuff, so I didn't make it as easy on myself as the recipe intended, but to me it's worth it.  The reason it doesn't get a full 5* is that the Alfredo and cheese was really thick after being baked...maybe adding a little milk would make it more saucy-I even made sure I didn't make a super thick Alfredo, I tried to make it the same consistency as I remember the jarred kind being.  Also, I wasn't a fan of the cheese on top of the breadcrumbs...it was a little rubbery to me.  Other than that, a winner!  Served for lunch with a salad.",

Rich and creamy (not at all dry like someone else said perhaps they did something wrong). Full of flavor. For the purist the flavor does include Alfredo flavor so be warned. I was skeptical but it's actually not a bad combo. Surprisingly. I did add a little more to the recipe though. I used one pound of cheddar and put 3/4 in the sauce and the other 1/4 on top. Then I topped with Italian herb bread crumbs and finally panko. The Italian herb added flavor and the panko added crisp! I didn't measure the bread crumbs but it was certainly more than 1/4 cup. I just sprinkled it on there until there was a good coating over the top. It turned out delicious. People went back for more and there was none left at the end of the night!",
