I make one of these healthy treats for myself every morning for breakfast, and it powers me all the way until lunch. I love the mild sweetness of the banana, but if you want it sweeter you could add sugar. I've also added different things like fresh ginger, cinnamon, apple, or any number of other things. Raw vegans can substitute raw almond milk for the soy. Feel free to experiment with different flavors, and enjoy the pure energy that comes from eating delicious and good-for-you food!",

I also had a golden delicious apple to use up and used just a tsp of natural peanut butter.  My banana was still a tiny bit green so the banana flavor isn't very strong.  I taste NO spinach whatsoever!  Every other flavor is represented subtly and it's a wonderful flavor!  \nI was alittle worried because I just have a regular $10 blender that it wouldn't get the pieces small enough to drink but it worked fine.  I can't afford a magic bullet or vitamix so I'm glad to know I can still enjoy a smoothie without it!",

I only use 1/4-1/5 banana to add a touch of sweetness without lots of carbs. And I add 1 TB of a healthy seed mix (chia/flax/hemp) to make it extra filling and add protein, fiber and iron. I use soy milk and two big handfuls of spinach. Thanks for the basic recipe\u2014it\u2019s a winner!",
