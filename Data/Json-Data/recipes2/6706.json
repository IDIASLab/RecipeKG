My steaks were still on the grill and so we were just eating all the sides and my guests said that they were so good they could've had these for the main course! They were tangy with the goat cheese and the tart lemon pepper with the charred grilled pepper was to die for. I made them again for a friend and her husband and he liked them so much he mentioned putting the steak inside and making a pepper steak sandwich! Make them you will love them!",
