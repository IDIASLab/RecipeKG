I chose to score and marinade my london broil in McCormick's Montreal Steak grilling sauce, which is my favorite way of preparing london broil....so easy and so tasty. Also, I broil the steak for about 10 min. per side instead of grilling.  The bleu cheese butter really made it though!!  I made the butter a few hours ahead of time so it could sit in the fridge and \"blend\".  Very robust flavor!  My husband loved it, he brought the leftovers to work today for lunch, which is always a sure sign of a keeper recipe.  Thanks for the post!",
