The ingredients were things I usually have on-hand and this made a nice, elegant sauce that I would happily serve to guests!  Hubby said he would definitely order it again from a restaurant!  :-)  Even the kids ate it, the flavor was light enough.  I also cooked it for 5 hours on HIGH setting and it was very tender.  I made this over egg noodles and the chicken breasts fell apart while cooking so it was more of a sauce over noodles with chunks of chicken.  Delicious!",

After cooking I added some goat cheese and cream for the creaminess. It was pretty tasty that way but next time I'll drain off some of the liquid first to make a thicker sauce. Because it does turn brown after cooking as some people have said -- doesn't really look like the sauce in the picture -- I think next time I'll also add a can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes with the cream and goat cheese at the end that would add more veggies and make for a more attractive color.",
