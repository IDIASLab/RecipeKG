I tried it out on my Philadelphia family (Philly, if you dont know, is the home of the Italian Hoagie) We all agreed, it really does taste like a real hoagie.\r\nI added more mayo and also added red wine vinegar at the end and I would say it takes much more prep time that 15 min, but boy was it worth it. It also keeps for a few days, so serve over a long weekend at the Jersey Shore!",

I did add some vinegar to the mixture as any hoagie I've ever had contained it. It was terrific!. I did scale this down to 4 servings and it made about 2 1/2 cups of dip even then. I chopped all the meat and cheese up rather than tore it was faster and more uniform. I will be making this again.",
