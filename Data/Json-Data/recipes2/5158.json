Don't cook them all the way through in the microwave, they'll end up mushy.  Let them cool a little after the microwave, then chop into smaller pieces for your skillet.  This works well for general baked potatos too.  After the microwave, just pop them in the oven for 15 - 20 minutes and they'll taste like they've been in there for hours.",

I browned the sausage and browned the potatoes sans added oil.  I also added a sliced carrot to give color and flavor.  One reviewer suggested a more limited time of warming the sauerkraut.  I added the kraut last and warmed for only 5 minutes on low -medium heat using homemade chicken broth rather than ale. (had no ale or beer on hand, but don't think it would have added much to the flavor).  The kraut I used was Bavarian style and sweeter than other varieties.  It was very flavorful with the mustard and sausage.  Warm and filling on a winter evening!",

Google it, you might be surprised!  It is not Dijon or spicy brown.   It has a bite to it and looks nothing like most \"sandwich\" mustard.   Do yourself a favor and make sure you use the right ingredient for this recipe!   It DOES make a difference!  I would also like to add that thanks to another reviewer I have made this with canned sliced potatoes (drained).   While I prefer fresh, when I am in a hurry they work very well with this recipe!     Smithwick's (Irish Ale) works well here.   Also, if you substituted bacon for the sausage and added some onion AND used true whole-grain mustard, this would be similar to German potato salad.",
