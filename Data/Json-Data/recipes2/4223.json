When I was at the store tonight I bought most of these ingredients, planning on creating a recipe.  Thank you for saving me that work!!!  UPDATE August 2014:  I've modified this recipe to remove the cheese, yeast, sugar, eggs and chicken broth (still had problems with allergies with those items).  I substituted about 2 cups of roasted sweet potatoes and increased the flax to 1 cup and brown rice flour to 2 cups.  If I add too much sweet potato, I just increase the flour and oats.  The dogs go nuts and camp out by the stove all night while the cookies are drying.  We live in east TX now, and I can can still store these for about 2 weeks in a ziploc bag with a little sachet of rice.  Good stuff!!",

I would only change a few things. I left the sugar out and put two tablespoons of peanut butter instead; it worked, and my dog loves it. Here are another couple tips: Firstly, this dough won't work if you want to use cookie-cutters. If you do, you will need a LOT more flour. Not IN the dough, but ON it. I got it to work by putting a lot of flour on some wax paper and my hands, then getting a clump of dough and rubbing flour on both sides then pressing the dough flat between my hands, then pressing it flat on the table, making sure to cover sticky areas with flour and making sure to get it thin enough. Secondly, I would change the baking time to 30-35 minutes. Otherwise, it's a wonderful recipe! :)",
