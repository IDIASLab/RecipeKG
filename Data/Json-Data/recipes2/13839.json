Served mine over rice his over low-carb pasta. We topped it with Parmesan cheese. We both really enjoyed this but thought it could have been a little \"saucier\". Next time will try adding 1/2 C. chicken broth and 1/2 C. tomato sauce and see if that does the trick but there definitely will be a next time.",
