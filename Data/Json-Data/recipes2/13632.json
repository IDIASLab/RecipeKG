This cut of meat doesn't/shouldn't need tenderizer, let alone this much!  Steak seasoning is good, as is olive oil, although Hubs says he doesn't really notice a difference with or without it.  Porterhouse works great for us - he enjoys the strip portion and I prefer the tenderloin.  Begin with steaks at room temperature.  Let rest, covered, for about 5 minutes after cooking to allow juices to redistribute.",
