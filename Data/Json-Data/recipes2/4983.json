I didn't remove the chicken before cooking the rice either I just cooked it all together. Also a quick note about the recipe itself it should read that the milk is replacing the water or to omit the water in the package directions. I'm not a novice cook so I already know that but to someone who doesn't have a lot of cooking experience I could see them adding both the milk and water the way it is written. This was so easy and delicious and I will be making this again!",
