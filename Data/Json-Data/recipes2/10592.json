I added more almond milk 1/4 cup at a time until I'd almost quadrupled the amount written just to get it to a drinkable consistency. Avocado in a smoothie is a very nice addition in both taste and creaminess though. So thumbs up over here. Thank you fordmarie for your recipe.",

If you use the 1/4 cup of almond milk it is way too thick. You can also add only 1 cup of the milk and it is still good just a little thicker. Also you don't have to pay attention to the size of the avocado just use any avocado that's ripe. This is delicious!!!! I have one every day now.",
