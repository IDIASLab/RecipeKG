The simmering broth must be added little by little, cooked and stirred till it's absorbed, then repeating this step, ladle by ladle of broth, until the risotto is tender but not mushy, the broth is absorbed, and the starches break down resulting in creamy risotto - however long that takes. In my case, it probably took twice as long as the recipe directed, but then I cooked this at moderate heat in order to release the starches slowly.  The end result was a creamy risotto with great flavor, the perfect complement to the pork piccata I served it with.",

Feel free to also adjust the wine to your preference. You can also try different variations to make this a main dish, peas & prociutto, shrimp and asparagus, chicken and mushroom, saffron & seafood... whatever you desire for the last mix in (cooked meat of course)! Optionally, you can add some tarragon to this and add more broth if you like it \"soupy\". It's fantastic!\n\nThose saying that it takes longer than 20 minutes to cook, that is because your cooking heat is too low and/or your broth is not hot enough (should not be boiling, but should be hot and kept over low-medium heat). When you add the broth, it should be boiling when it hits the risotto. It should take about 2 minutes for your broth to be fully absorbed after constant stirring.  Hope this helps!",

This recipe is a close second!  I've made it twice now, and I've found that I prefer to use about twice as much wine as called for (and of course then cut back on the chicken stock), as well as add a clove of garlic with the shallots (but I love garlic, so this may not be for all).

I will have to remember this recipe when I am entertaining vegetarian guests, although I cannot wait to make it again and top it with seared and caramelized diver scallops.  I added a clove of garlic, doubled the amount of wine, and used chicken stock rather than broth. I added only two Tablespoons of butter but did add some extra Parmesan Reggiano.  I did not need as much liquid as the recipe noted.   If you are new to risotto making be aware that the amount of liquid needed can change each time you make it, so always check your rice as you go along, don\u2019t just blindly follow a recipe or use the amount you used when you made the dish previously.  As for being too much work\u2026how much work is stirring really?  It only takes one hand and you\u2019ve opened a nice bottle of wine for the risotto so you have one hand free to enjoy a glass as you stir.  What could be better than that?",
