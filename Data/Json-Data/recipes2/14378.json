I call these \"Mexican pinwheels\" and everyone loves them however I mixed in a 1/2 a pkg of dry taco seasoning or you can use some ranch pkg mix (add either to taste). Diced green onions are a good addition too. If you know that the folks eating these like spicy food mix in some cayenne pepper diced jalapenos etc. Try flavored or wheat tortillas for a twist. I like more somethin somethin...but the basic recipe is good for starters. As \"Dora\" stated I roll these up wrap tightly in plastic wrap & refrigerate overnight before slicing. I discard the funky ends of each roll. Also made fresh salsa for dipping. A fun finger food if you are willing to put a bit of time into this. Plus it yields a lot of \"wheels\" so to speak - plenty for a party.",

The best part: unlike other tortilla pinwheel recipes this one looks simple so pickier munchers will try these before the ones with all the different spots in them. That means you don't have to worry about leftovers! Tip: don't spread to the outside edges of the tortillas that will be the ends of the wrap...that part gets tossed anyway. Also next time I'll use smaller tortillas or fewer large ones so there will be more creamy filling in each bite.",
