You want your fajita mixture to sizzle when you serve, so make sure to prepare all your fixings (lettuce, tomatoes, cilantro, and jalapeno peppers) before you cook the shrimp. Arrange fixings on a serving tray with shredded cheese and sour cream.",

I thought the bean and shrimp combo sounded odd but it worked good together. I made my shopping list from the ingredient list so I didn't see the other ingredients mentioned in the recipe description. A layer of shredded lettuce between the beans and shrimp would have been a nice touch. Good recipe though and one I would make again.",
