I even subbed all the flour for whole wheat! I've never made a w.w. pancake this fluffy before. I did add a little extra of the soda and powder. I didn't have sour cream so used a 6 oz. container of f.f. blackberry yogurt I had hanging around. I love the fact that this is high in fiber and very low fat...no butter or oil. Sprayed the pan with Pam and used butter spray and some honey on top! Filled me up on this rainy morning. Wonderful recipe and great with the whole wheat flour in lieu of all-purpose. If one doesn't like the batter that thick(it was more like a bread or muffin batter) just thin it with some water or milk to your liking.",

I liked the idea that it also uses oatmeal (since I have a lot of it in my cupboard!) I figured why not I'll give it a try and make it into waffles. My experiment was a success--nice light waffles with a hint of cinnamon. I doubled the recipe and it made 4 full-sized waffles. I baked them in my waffle iron for approximately 8-9 minutes each. My husband gave them a thumbs up too!",

Added rest of dry ingredients w/ a full tsp of cinnamon pulsed couple more times to mix. Used plain organic yogurt instead of sour cream & added 1/2 tsp liquid stevia to wet ingredients. Added almost 1/2 cup diced walnuts. Mixed dry ingredients into wet to make some really awsome & very healthy pancakes that were highly approved by my 20 mo' old 3 yr. old & hubby. UPDATE: made these again & instead of plain yogurt I used 1/2 c of my homemade vanilla yogurt (32 oz plain organic yogurt mixed w/ 1 tsp stevia & 1 tsp vanilla). Family said these were even better. I serve them to my kids w/ a little raw organic butter & raw honey. Always a big request!",

The packets had chunks of dried apples in them that were really good in the pancakes. To compensate for the extra oatmeal I upped the milk to 1/2 cup. These are heavy pancakes and the batter is thick. You will need to make sure that you cook them on medium heat to make sure they get done in the middle. I browned mine nicely on both sides but still had a few with 'raw' middles'. I tossed them back into the skillet on low heat and finished cooking them through. My toddler asked for seconds on them - so I will definitely make these again.",
