I would add 1/2 to 1 cup of water to the chili after all the other ingredients to make it a little more like soup. If your kids absolutely do not like spicy things, you could add sour cream and cheese to it. Serve with corn chips or corn bread.",

What's up with spices?\" It was hard to tell if the spices were accidentally duplicated in the ingredient list but I didn't see much point to seasoning the ground beef w/ all of that followed by adding everything to the pot while measuring all the spices out again so I just added it all at once after the meat was browned and drained which incidentally the recipe doesn't indicate to drain. I can't say that this chili blew our minds but I thought it would be way more flavorful w/ all of those spices not to mention also including a McCormick packet of chili seasoning; if anything the packet plus the 1 TB seasoning salt made this awfully salty so we didn't get as much enjoyment over dragging Frito Scoops through it. Maybe w/ some changes here and there I'd make it again but otherwise won't live on as a famous recipe in our house.",
