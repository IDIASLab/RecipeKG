I always brown the pork in a bit of sesame oil first - this gives great bits to scrape up from the bottom which contribute depth to the flavor of the broth.  Just as the pork browns I add 1/2 sweet onion, thinly diced, along with the garlic and the ginger.  Then the chicken broth and the remaining ingredients in their order, excluding the cayenne which I haven't used since the very first time when I made this as written.  I also use an entire 8 oz. container of diced mushrooms, and rice vinegar in place of white vinegar.",

I am doing Weight Watchers so I used a \"soy meat product\" called Yves meatless ground stuffer for lettuce wraps in order to cut calories. It figures out to 2 Points per serving this way! I think I might count it as a Core meal too. Very delicious!! I am thinking you could easily add tofu to this as well. Thanks for a keeper!!",

The taste is better than expected even if you don't have all the ingredients! I only had one vegetable which was the cabbage (sauteed some onion first in the pot before adding the broth). I used both chicken & beef broth a can each that's all I had in my cupboard to make a serving for 2. Instead of Schezwan sauce I used some Srircha chili sauce to give it some spice without measuring. Instead of real ginger I used powder ginger. Once I added the vinegar I tried to minimize stirring the soup that much since I learned from making chicken adobo to not disturb or stir the meat while it has vinegar otherwise it makes it more sour! Since I had Asian cilantro chopped up as a topping before serving to give it some herb freshness. Will definitely make again!",
