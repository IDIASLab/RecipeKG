I l added a little more rosemary because we both really love it. I also think doubling the sauce is a good idea if you are making 4 steaks. I used the recipe as written and it really only made enough for 2 mid-size ribeyes - but I like the sauce thickish and a thinner sauce would obviously go further. I seasoned my steaks with salt and back pepper only and made the sauce in the searing pan. Thanks for the recipe!",

I saut\u00e9ed a dab of minced garlic in olive oil, then used Chardonnay and chicken broth with a can of roasted diced tomatoes as directed with the rosemary. Because my husband likes spice, I threw in some red pepper flakes too. After simmering for a bit I thought it was a bit too spicy (I didn't measure the red pepper, opsy), so I added a little more broth and wine. I generous tablespoon of butter whisked in at the end really made the sauce. I put fresh saut\u00e9ed spinach over egg noodles, with oven roasted chicken breast then topped with the sauce. It doesn't make a lot, so will double next time I make it.",
