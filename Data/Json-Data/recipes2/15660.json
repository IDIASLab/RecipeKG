The soup had a rich flavour thanks to the sherry and cream while the mushrooms had a buttery texture. Perfect as a meal when served with crusty bread. I made this for the first time tonight and just added 2 cloves of crushed garlic to the melted butter before sauteeing the mushrooms. I used low fat thickened cream and this created the perfect degree of richness for me. The soup only need a little cracked black pepper on serving. I'm definitely going to be making this soup throughout the winter.",

I followed the recipe (also adding a little green onion for flavor) up to the chicken broth and then added only one can (14 oz.) of chicken broth. I added the 1 cube beef bouillon as you would for the whole recipe. I didn't have any sherry so omitted it and just stirred in the (1/2 c.) cream cooking just until heated through. Man was it delicious! It tasted just like what you would get in a fine restaurant! Of course making it this way cuts down on the number of servings so I have to say this would probably serve 2 to 3 very nicely. To tell you the truth \"I ate the whole thing\" all by myself!",
