Tips:  Use several pounds of fresh pork neck bones slow cooked down in medium size crock pot till meat falls from the bone.  SAVE the broth!  Use 1/2 broth, 1/2 EVAPORATED milk.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Then to break tradition try some WHITE corn meal instead of yellow.  Slice THIN (1/8 to 1/4 in.) with razor sharp slicing knife and fry in very small amount of extra virgin olive oil till well browned or desired doneness is achieved. YUM YUM!!",
