                "reviewBody": "This is a good solution if you happen to run out of baking powder but there is a difference between double action and this single action recipe.  The absence of calcium acid phosphate and sodium aluminum sulfate make this recipe \"single action\".  When these ingredients are heated you have a higher rise in your baked goods.  This recipe is successful but you must get your baked goods into the preheated oven immediately to get the most rise possible.   The corn starch is present only to help with incorporation and if you make a large quantity it keeps it from clumping together. It will loose its effectiveness so large quantity storage is not recommended.  I have used this recipe with good success (but, it was a fail when making light and fluffy biscuits. They require double action powder) and it is easy enough to put together I see no need to make larger amounts. This is also a good recipe if you wish to avoid aluminum in your diet as commercial double action baking powder is made with it.",
