The mixture of raw garlic cloves feta cheese and Kalamata olives nets an end product that I do not care for. Nevertheless you can save this from being a disaster if you 1) add the juice of 1/2 lemon and 2) add 1 can drained garbanzo beans. Puree together with the rest of the ingredients in the food processor. This will change the dish into a cheesy hummus which is tasty. However the red pepper is still overwhelmed and I would suggest using only 1/2 packet of the onion soup mix otherwise your dish will be too salty. The fact that the recipe holds such a strong flavor even after the addition of 15 oz. of garbanzo beans gives you some idea of how pungent these components are when combined. It will be some time before I try this again.",

Flavors had a chance to even out and blend seemed creamier to. I also used half the olives as I'm not real big on them and it still left plenty of strong olive flavor maybe becaused I used mediterranean style? Think I will try a milder olive next time. Served it with crispy everything bagel chips loved it! Thought they really mixed well together. I was sceptical at first but it has definitely grown on me.......will make this again since I've managed to eat most of it. Thanks for the recipe.",
