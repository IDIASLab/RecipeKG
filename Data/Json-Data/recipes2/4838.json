We did enjoy the combination of flavors but had I known how dry it was gonna be I would've made more dressing. I made the 'Caesar Salad Supreme' dressing from this site and it was wonderful in this there just wasn't enough and I added more than called for (maybe I was supposed to use more of a vinegarette-type caesar dressing and that was the issue???). I may try to play around w/ this more b/c like I said it was good just dry...Thanks for sharing.:)",
