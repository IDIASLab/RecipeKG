This recipe is ridiculously easy to make and they do taste yummy.  Not sure this is one for little kids.  I chilled them thoroughly, but that delicious chocolate melts pretty quickly...did a lot of finger licking after I sampled a couple.  The recipe says to refrigerate until cool, but I\u2019d recommend keeping them in the fridge.  If I make again, I\u2019ll probably add a bit more peanut butter (personal taste), but these definitely will be gone soon.  Thanks for sharing linda!",

With that being said, these are one of the BEST dairy/soy free sweet treats that I have made in months.  To comply with my dietary restrictions, I used Enjoy Life chocolate chips and natural peanut butter.  I stuck to one cup of the chocolate chips, but did large, heaping tablespoons on the peanut butter.  I also substituted the Cornflakes for Rice Krispies.  (Rice Krispies are \"safe\" for me, plus I had them on hand.)  Very satisfying for a sweet craving!",

While I was making them I did not think they would turn out to be good. It got a bit messy. I did use a little more peanut butter than called for ( i love PB). I threw them on the cookie sheet and put them in the freezer. 25 min later they were ready and I took my first bite and was happily surprised they were so good. Tasted like a Reeses PB Cup but crunchy. I love crunchy food. So easy to make and I had all the ingredients already! Will definitely make again.",
