This dish is great because the chicken can be hot or cold. I was having friends over for dinner last minute and I was able to whip this up quick and actually get all the bowls set and ready on the table for when they arrived. The only things I tweaked was using vegetable oil instead of olive added cucumbers and I used multi colored grape tomatoes. It was delicious fast and beautiful to look at!",

The reason I chose to do this was so that I wouldn't lose the breading while slicing and also so that I would have breading on all sides of the chicken. I also chose a spring mix over lettuce simply for the fact we prefer it better. This is a fast and easy recipe and one that is easily adaptable to what you like on your salad. Thanks for sharing!",
