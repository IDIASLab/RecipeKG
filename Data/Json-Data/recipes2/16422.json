I used raspberry Jello and powdered reconstituted buttermilk and it was still great. A quick tip--you don't need to cool completely/let it set up in between additions. Cook the pineapple add the Jello and you can immediately add the buttermilk. As soon as it's cool enough to not melt the Cool Whip you can put it all together. I put it in a small/med oiled mold which was a mistake--this makes enough for a 13\"x9\" pan. However the mold looked great! All in all this is a great recipe thanks for sharing it!",
