I wanted to load up the freezer because summer is a busy time for us and these would make for easy suppers. I have to say this has been our least favorite burger so far. It is just so dry. I added Moroccan seasoning and served them in pita with cucumber sauce. Even with the sauce they were just overwhelming dry. I think it's the nuts. None of the other recipes used nuts. I love nuts but apparently not in my veggie burger. It seemed to get worse the more you ate it. Our stars lowered throughout the meal. I couldn't bring myself to finish one. It was better with feta and olives but that's only because they were making the lack of good flavor. I'll not be making these again.",

The avocado is a great compliment.  We didn't use the ranch dressing since we are vegan.",

I used walnuts and pumpkin seeds and made mine vegan by using veganaise instead of an egg. I used chopped chives instead of diced onion because that's what I had on hand. My seasonings: garlic powder (no fresh garlic on hand) smoked paprika and black and red pepper. And I used lentils...again what I had on hand. I also added a dash of liquid smoke and tamari. I used a food processor and I even overprocessed the mixture a bit and it's still fantastic. I had no trouble with mine staying together. I just handled them gently when flipping and they did fine. I served on toasted ww buns with sliced tomatoes broccoli sprouts and smoked tomato dressing. Oh yeah...I'll be making these again!",

I do also believe it needs a lot more spice they tasted just a little too bland for my tastes but found that when reheated the next day the texture and taste was a lot better than when first making them. As for the crumbling and falling apart try adding in \"vital wheat gluten\" if you're not allergic to wheat products; it helps hold them together.
