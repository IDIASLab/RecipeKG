I tweaked it a bit and thought it was great and if you want to make it healthier you can make these changes: reduce the sugar to 1 T as it is really way too sweet otherwise and sub the sugar for artificial stevia-based sweetener; reduce cocoa to 1 teaspoon and add a scoop of chocolate whey protein. That will give you the right macronutrient balance between carbs and protein in case you are like me and oatmeal without more protein will leave you with low blood-sugar or hungry within an hour or two. Use skim milk or almond milk ---- it works just as well. In sum here is what worked for me: old-fashioned rolled oats: 1/2 cup with 1 cup skim milk mixed with 1 teaspoon cocoa the almond extract and 1 T Truvia (Krisda is the same thing if that's what you have in your area). Mixed together and microwaved on medium for five minutes. Stirred in 1 scoop of chocolate protein powder and the banana afterwards along with the almonds. If the oats seem watery add a bit more whey protein. Ate with 1/4 cup almond milk and it was soooo good.",
