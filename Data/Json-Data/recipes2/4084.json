I broke my cauliflower into very small pieces to make it easier to get a little of everything on one fork and I also used Spanish pimento-stuffed olives and the red added nice color. Next time I think I'll add some chopped red pepper for more color and I think KyminNM had a great idea to add edamame - that would be fabulous in this! Still this is a nice change-of-pace salad particularly for us cauliflower lovers!",
