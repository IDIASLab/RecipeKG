It was a good consistency but hubby and I both thought it was way too spicy and we like spicy foods. I will make it again but use only a pinch of cayenne maybe 1/8 tsp max. I think the addition of the vodka is very important to keep the sorbet soft and not too icy. Overall another great recipe from Chef John just a little too much heat.",

I used a bit more than 1/2 of the cayenne it called for and it's still got a kick so beware... unless you are a spice monster maybe start with than 1/4 tsp. Oh and I made with allulose and splenda for those who are low-carbing it works fine.",
