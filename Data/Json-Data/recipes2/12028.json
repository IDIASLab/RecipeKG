If it is too sweet, use a can of solid packed pumpkin in place of the pumpkin pie filling and use more broth and some pumpkin pie spice. I've made it both ways, and both are great. My husband preferred it with the pumpkin pie mix. Modify the cayenne pepper to taste; we like it spicy so we use 2 teaspoons!",

I didn't have the pumpkin pie filling on hand but DID have 100% pure pumpkin so I knew I would need to add in some sugar salt cinnamon ginger ground cloves and nutmeg. I read the submitters indication that they prefer things spicy so I kept that in mind and scaled back the cayenne. I also knew I wanted it to have some more depth than just chicken broth so I did a mixture of chicken broth (1 cup) and heavy cream (4 Tbsp). It was very tasty but I thought it needed a little something extra. I rummaged around in my fridge and found some ground sausage I had previously cooked...I added in about 1/2 cup and gave it another taste...OMG yum!!!! Don't allow the bad reviews to sway you made right it's really yummy! I think next time I may add in a bit of brie cheese for extra creaminess",

Two teaspoons of Cayenne was way too spicy for us and we like our spice. One teaspoon of cayeene would have been plenty. Also the sauce was not as saucy as we would like. It was very chunky and thick. We added more broth but it was still quite thick. Not sure if i'd try this again.",
