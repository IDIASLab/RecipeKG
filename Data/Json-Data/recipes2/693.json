Next time I'll add a bit more salt but it's much better for a recipe to err on the side of caution. It's easy to add a bit after cooking but if the marinade was over salted you'd be sunk. Looking at the chicken I was afraid this marinade would stick to the grill but I didn't have any problem with that. I did use Mazola (R) corn oil on a paper towel to oil the grate. I usually have used olive oil and I think the Mazola worked better so I'll use that from now on. Easy chicken potato salad and some fresh green beans. That's mid-June at its best in upstate New York. Thanks Mazola for a great dinner and for your sponsorship of Allrecipes.com.",

Of course as marinade ingredients do not have to be exact but this recipe could have been written in an easier format. The garlic needed is about 2 bulbs and the lemon juice is about the juice from one large lemon or 1 1/2 small. Fresh basil is best but the conversion to dry is 1 tsp dry to 1 tbsp fresh or 1 to 3 dry to fresh and dry works fine. Thanks to others for the suggestion of salad for leftovers.
