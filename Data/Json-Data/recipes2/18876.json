I was worried about it being too spicy when I read the reviews before trying the recipe. I went ahead and used the peppers anyway but I made sure that I did not include the seeds. Next time I will include the seeds to give it more of a kick. The flavor was really good though. We used this sauce on homemade burgers with thick crispy bacon and it was wonderful. Oh yeah- I also made homemade steak fries for the side dish and this sauce was fantastic drizzled over the top of the crispy fries. This is a keeper!",
