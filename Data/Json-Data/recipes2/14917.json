Because I was having a small dinner party with other appetizers the plate I used was about the size of a salad plate. Smooth the cream cheese all the way to the 'lip' of the plate (reduced the ingredients). Spread an even layer of cocktail sauce over the cream cheese; I think this sauce can be overpowering so keep it thin. Drain frozen baby shrimp well to spread over the top of the cocktail sauce; next green onions chpd tomatoes & finely shredded mozzeralla cheese as suggested by another reviewer. I also left off the black olives. This makes a pretty dish and I like the thin layers to scoop up with the thin triangular shaped Triscuit crackers. I served with Cheese Easy Squares honey roasted peanuts; as well as blue chips with a artichoke salsa. A hit with my guests!",
