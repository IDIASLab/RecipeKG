I placed the meat on the light side of the bread, as the edges toast nicely when they go back into the oven. I have to say- I tried the mix cold before putting back in the oven with the cheese- I like it even better! It tasted great both ways, but it's nice to know you can use it as a cold appetizer too...thanks!",

I wish the recipe had more \"kick\" than sweet. I also made this as a dip in a shallow bowl and served the baguettes on the side. (Less labor intensive this way.) It's better if you mix the cheese into the overall mixture as well instead of just putting it on top. You could still sprinkle some cheese on top if you wanted.",
