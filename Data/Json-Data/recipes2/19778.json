I used a rotisserie chicken (the whole thing, which was a bit much, next time I will add another can of tomatoes to thin soup a little)  I also didn't have canned tomatoes with chilis in them ( impossible to find Rotel in Toronto) so I just used regular canned diced tomatoes and add a bunch of jalopenos from a can. I went light on the cayenne (1/4 tsp) because I was making it for my parents and didn't want it to be too spicy for them.  I also took a flour tortilla, sprinkled some chili powder on it, cut it into thin strips, and baked it for a few minutes.  I topped the soup with aged cheddar, sour cream, sliced avocado, cilantro and a couple of the the tortillas strips arranged artfully on top.  It looked like soup at a fancy restaurant and the taste was awesome. I had it three times last week and have been craving it ever since.  You won't be disappointed.  Thanks!",

Tortilla soup is one of those things that is hard to get right especially if you're from San Antonio; it needs to be spicy yet flavorful and above all authentic. I can't believe Ro-Tel and canned chilis can be this perfect...I may never try that other recipe with fresh tomatoes and jalapenos. I served it over tortilla chips instead of frying the tortillas.",

The flour tortillas are a nice change from the normal corn. My husband likes the flour ones but not the corn so this is just perfect. This would be really great with black olive slices added at the last minute also. I did add extra lime juice just a personal preference. This is a great recipe. It is very spicy with the cumin and cayenne pepper. If children will be eating you might want to half the amounts on these two. Thank you for the fabulous recipe Sheila!!!",
