Sure they are made with \"Just Cheese\" and \"Artisan\" Cheeses to boot, but the price is like Prime Rib Expensive!\nI made one change, since I used hard/block cheese, I cut slices, then halved those, then thirded those.. so a tiny rectangle about 3/4\"X 1\" , it made tiny crisps, but that makes it more like a snack, and less like a meal. \nI cooked them @ 400*f for 8.5 min. any longer and they got a twinge of over doneness taste to them... any less and the centers were slightly chewy. \nI also experimented with seasonings, like Cheddar and Taco Seasoning, Mozzarella and Italian Spice, Pepper Jack Cheese(by itself), and Jack and Ranch Dressing seasoning. All were great, and only took a bit of tweaking with amounts of spice, and time in the oven. It was a fun day. With loads of snacks to show for my time!! Equivalent amount of Store Bought snacks would have been prohibitively expensive! And I had FUN! You just can't buy that kind of feeling of accomplishment. BE",

                "reviewBody": "Perfect little snack.  This recipe is more technique than recipe, but it works very well.\n\nSome tips:\n\n-Use a 24 cup muffin tin to make perfect little chips. No need to use paper if it's nonstick, or use cupcake liners.\n-WEIGH the cheese, then divide by 24. Now you have even portions that cook at roughly the same time. Put a little potion cup on the scale, tier it out, then add the correct weight of cheese.\n-Cook only ONE cheese at a time per pan. I found that some cheeses (harder more aged) cooked faster, while others (the mozzarella especially)  took longer. Mixed pans make it impossible to time things.\n-Drain on paper towel. Yes, they will be soft when you turn them out, but the added fat absorption will make them crispy and a bit less caloric. \n-Eat them soon. From past experiences with the microwave technique, I know these will only last a few days before the cheese gets 'funky' when stored at room temp. I'm not sure why, but it tends to go off fast. You could refrigerate or freeze them, but they get chewy. If that's what you're going for, have at it.",

I noticed less is more and you really only want to put a pinch of cheese in each - no need to spray if it's a non-stick pan!  Grease pooled on the top of each and I gently dumped it onto a paper towel (the crisps stayed put!)  I gave it a few minutes to cool, took a spoon and pressed the edge of each and they popped right out!  I put them on a paper towel to absorb a little more grease and tried to keep myself from eating them quicker than I could make them!  I used a small block of sharp cheddar, grated it and that's what I used - cheap and delicious!!",
