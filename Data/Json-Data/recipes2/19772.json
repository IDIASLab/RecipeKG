I cook a lot and usually dishes much more complicated than this; however I enjoy a little break from time to time.  This chowder tastes like much more than opening cans!  My husband thought it should be thicker but I myself liked the thinner consistancy.  Our son wouldn't even try it but our daughter loved it and asked for seconds!  I used equal amounts of whole milk and half and half and that worked well.  I would definitely make this again!",
