I think an alfredo sauce would have been better though. I cook with white wine a lot but it just didn't seem to fit here. On the note of the sauce you'll need to double the amount the recipe calls for if you want enough for a regular size pizza. The only change I made was with the pizza dough. After a hard day at work a lengthy commute home and a stop at the grocery store I chose a refrigerated pre-made dough that was ready to fill and go. Oh and my little town grocery store was completely out of any type of fresh mushroom so I had to resort to can. Overall this was a good recipe and one I'd like to play around with a bit more. You couldn't ask for a prettier looking pizza.",
