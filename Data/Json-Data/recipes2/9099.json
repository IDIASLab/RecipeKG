Around the last 7 minutes in the oven the apples were still crisp but very dry so I put in a couple of pats of butter and that seemed to help some. The recipe is very nice. I think you need to use a juicy type of apple though. It isn't too sweet a good thing for me. The natural flavour of the apple and the nuts stands out. I used sliced almonds and agave syrup in place of the walnuts and maple syrup. Thank you TsKitchen for your recipe.",
