I added garlic Parmesan and pepper to the Alfredo sauce but couldn't get the flavor I wanted. It was very bland. Maybe if you made your own Alfredo sauce it would be better. I also think the mushrooms would be better thinly sliced vs chopped. It was a little tastier the next day. Required a lot of Parmesan on top",
