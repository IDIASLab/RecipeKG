My father has made this recipe for years, and it is always requested from his grandchildren.  A slice of hoe cake will warm your insides -- slathered with some homemade apple butter alongside of some butter beans, freshly sliced tomatoes and a good tall glass of sweet tea.  I promise your family will love this truly Southern recipe!",

Sorry I'm not southern! It cooked for a little over 20 minutes and I had to add extra milk because the batter was too thick. I used the bacon grease instead of shortening. Quick and Easy bread to serve as a side. Would probably work well cooking over a fire for a campout.",

One cup of milk in the batter is WAY to little to make a thick but still runny batter. I had to add at least 1/2 cup extra if not more. Finally if your going to serve this with apple butter or any kind of fruit topping for that matter don't use the garlic salt I'm sure you can understand why. The end product I think is worth doing the extra problem solving because it's actually a surprisingly good bread considering it's simplicity. It's a really crust bread that I feel when sliced thin can be enjoyed with many soups.",
