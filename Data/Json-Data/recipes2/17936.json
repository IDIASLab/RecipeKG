For those of you who are diabetic please be aware that Splenda Brown Sugar Blend contains 1/2 regular brown sugar...it's NOT sugar free!) I also subbed 1 cup of white whole wheat flour for one of the 3 cups of all-purpose flour. I baked it in a catering half-pan about 9x12 inches for 43 minutes and it came out just right!",

Splenda cakes tend to be rather dense but this one was fluffier. It's not as fluffy as a cake that uses regular sugar but it's definitely fluffier than any other Splenda cake I have tried making. I made it during the summer so I had fresh blueberries that were in season. For the topping I used Splenda Brown Sugar blend (which contains some real brown sugar so it's not sugar-free). Instead of one full teaspoon of vanilla I used 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. I know from experience that this combination works really well to bring out the taste of blueberries. The recipe yielded two 6\" round cake pans. I would definitely make this recipe again. Thanks:)",
