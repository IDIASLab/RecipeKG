Usually a heavy splash or so. Second, use very good vanilla vodka. I've tried it with cheap vodka, and you can't taste the vanilla, which really makes or breaks this drink. You might be able to get away with regular vodka and a light splash of vanilla extract, but I really suggest the vanilla vodka. ",

Wow! My girlfriend and I took one sip and knew we were in for trouble! Our hubbies found them too sweet - so this is definitely one for the gals. Enjoy!",
