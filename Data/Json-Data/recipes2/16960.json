Funny enough, this was created as an experiment with leftovers, and now I have over 15 friends making it on a regular basis! This is a great recipe that can be stored in the refrigerator for several days for a quick, anytime snack.

It\u2019s easy to alter according to your preference: I used an extra \u00bd can of black beans, frozen baby white corn (I microwaved it), and extra avocado.  I also made my own salsa recipe really quickly with lots of garlic and cilantro!!  One night, my family spooned it over hot baked potatoes, and we loved every bite.  We also have added chicken from the barbeque and a little bit of cheddar and put it over baked potatoes.  Dave, thank you for sharing your recipe that is now one of our favorites!",

The first was I mashed the avocado and mixed it with the small curd cheese until well blended. Then I thought this would make a great wrap so I heated the beans and corn with half the salsa. I spread about 3 tbs of the avocado mixture on warm WW tortillas spread the bean mixture over that and topped with a little more salsa and diced tomato. Absolutely delicious! Great recipe!",
