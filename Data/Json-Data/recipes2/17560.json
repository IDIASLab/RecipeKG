I chose to bake half the recipe to see how it would turn out so it took 20 minutes at 350 degrees. The flavors blended nicely and the texture was great. It does set up quickly so this would be nice in a crock pot to keep it warm. It is delicious chilled also. I served this with toasted onion bagels cut into bite size pieces. Ths would be a great appetizer for breakfast or brunch also. Next time I may add some diced red pepper. Thanks for sharing I will use this again:)",
