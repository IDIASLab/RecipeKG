I have had grilled romaine at a restaurant before but I have never done it at home. Thanks to Baking Nana and to the Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven my grilled romaine was a success. The CIO was a real help because I could see what was going on with the romaine as it grilled. There is no need to wait for summer to grill with this appliance and actually it's too hot to grill outside for me in the summer so win win! The garlic flavored oil was just right on the veggies. I used \"Delicious Chicken Fajita Marinade\" from this site on the chicken so in case you happen not to have any bottled marinade you can still accomplish this gem of a recipe. (Note to self: add some smoked paprika to the marinade next time for a hint of smokiness in the flavor.) Low-carb Tex-Mex healthy protein rainbow veggies--what more could a girl ask for in a lunch or light dinner? Thanks Baking Nana!",
