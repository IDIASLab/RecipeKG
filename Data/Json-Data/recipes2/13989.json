Just added 2 cloves garlic, low sodium/fat soups, no salt cracker, cut the butter down to 1/4 cup. I also increased the rice to 1 cup and mixed the soups with the milk before I poured over the ingredients.  This fits perfectly in the rectangle pampered chef stone.  Someone mentioned that they wouldn't add the crackers next time because the next day they were soggy; however, my family liked the flavour of the cracker in the leftovers - tasted like a buttery stuffing.  I also have a kitchen scale so i converted to help you out (cause I didnt know how much was 10 oz of broccoli or cauliflower)  10 oz broccloli florets is about 4cups, 10 oz. cauliflower florets is about 3 cups.  This of course depends on how you chop, but at least it can give you an idea.",

Changed order of recipe by then adding milk, soup, and about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar (not  a pound of Velveeta!) to make a sauce THEN stirred in the broccoli, cauliflower, and rice. All fit into  an 8x8 glass dish.  Sprinkled top with  freshly ground pepper, Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers, and a little more cheddar.  Would be good with ham on side or even in the casserole.",

I left out the onions and celery (my preference) and I used block cheddar cheese chopped up. I added garlic to the butter when I sauteed the broccoli and cauliflower. Well it looks like I changed the recipe completely - however I give it 5 stars because the base recipe was strong enough to with stand my changes and still be great!
