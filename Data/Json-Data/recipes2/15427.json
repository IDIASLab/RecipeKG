All my brownie recipes call for 4 or more eggs. Thankfully I found this recipe. And to think you make it out of a cake mix. Even better. I thru them together in no time. I of course had to try them before I just gave them to my hubby. Well I only wrapped up 16 kept the other 8 for myself. He sure wasn't getting the whole batch. Not after I tasted them. Thanks a whole bunch for this time saving recipe. Definately will be making this again plus will be passing it on to my daughter. She just loves easy brownie and cookie recipes. And this one is right up her alley.",
