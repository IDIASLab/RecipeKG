Broken down for 1 pound of ground beef, add: 1 Tbsp onion powder, 1Tbsp garlic powder, 1Tbsp cumin, 1Tbsp sugar ( yes, Sugar!), and 1tsp salt.  These days, I like to chop a Vidalea onion and about 1 cup of chopped red, yellow and orange sweet bell peppers. Saute'  the onions & peppers, then add the ground beef and brown it with the onions & peppers, then add the spices when the meat is about halfway browned so the flavors have time to intermingle.  DON'T add tomato sauce, paste or any of that!  You add salsa when you assemble your tacos, burritos, tostadas or whatever after putting on your lettuce, guacamole, tomatoes & whatever you like on your Mexican food.   Enjoy, Amigos!",
