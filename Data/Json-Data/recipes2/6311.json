Here are my alterations: 1.Cut the recipe in 1/2 to serve 2 people 2. When sauteing the red pepper asparagus & garlic add garlic last. Minced garlic doesn't take long to cook & you def. don't want it to burn or it will ruin the dish 3. Used button mushrooms (thats all i had on hand-worked out fine) 4. Sauted veggies in EVOO & a little butter 5. After flatening the chicken breast I seasoned the outside with onion powder poultry seasoning & black pepper & little seasoned salt then rolled up and returned to same pan I cooked veggies in to brown both sides of chicken (also added about little EVOO to pan before putting chicken in) 6. For the sauce on top-I deglazed the pan by adding about 1/4 cup chicken broth to pan & scraping all that good yummy stuff at the bottom let reduce for about 1 minute then added the entire can of cream of mushroom soup. I skipped the milk & added about 3 tblpns 1/2 & 1/2. Also seasonsed the sauce w/about 1 tspn poultry seasoning & onion poweder dash black pepper & little garlic salt. SO GOOD!! Loved it!",
