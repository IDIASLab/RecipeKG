I did everything else according to the recipe only I added a bit of Worcestershire (maybe 2 tsp.) about 1/4 cup sherry garlic powder onion powder and chili powder (all to taste). My husband and I couldn't get enough. I still gave the recipe a 5 because it really is so simple and the base is still good but easily modified to taste.",

Like another reviewer Pop used clam juice (or started by boiling the clam shells to make the broth)too rather than water. (I have recently found clam base which is very effective. Adjust salt if you use this.) He also added 2 well rounded TBSP of paprika - add the crumbled bacon to the soup at the end. This chowder blew out at his restaurant - you'll see why!",

I followed previous reviewer with the bacon idea but about half the paprika. Also since the only suitable bread I had was a couple days past its best I turned it into croutons frying in the same bacon grease. I only had canned clams and yellow rather than green pepper and only a little green onions so I added regular onions. This was a HUGE HIT with my husband. He raved and raved about it.
