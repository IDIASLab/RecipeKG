Of paste out of the can & then trying to figure out what to do with the rest of the can so after cooking it for a while I added the rest of the tomato paste that was in one of those little cans & continued cooking the remainder of the time. Other than that & having to use 2 skillets instead of one to fit everything in with the chicken too I really liked this recipe. I definately will be making it again. I paired it with a penne pepperoni & cheese pasta & the sauce form this was an added addition to the pasta.all around a very good recipe.",
