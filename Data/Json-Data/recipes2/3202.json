This is excellent as is but can be changed up based on what is in your fridge.  Next time I may try feta or parmesan.  romaine lettuce would be good also if you don't have spinach, but if you have fresh spinach definitely use it as it is so good for you.  thanks for sharing, these will be great for my lunches!",

The beauty of this wrap is that you can add/subract things according to your personal preference and even change up the hummus flavors (I used roasted red pepper flavor). I would make this again!

Both times I've made my own hummus once the classic chickpea but this most recent time I was using red kidney bean hummus. Still a fantastic wrap. I've also played around with the cheeses using fresh Parmesan in my wraps to save on calories recently using colby jack because that's what I had in the house I've done with white and sun-dried tomato flour tortillas as well as wheat tortillas. My teenager who swears she doesn't like raw spinach hummus or artichokes (or any of the ingredients except the tortillas ha!) has always enjoyed this wrap. I give her a whole one in her lunch or half of one as an after school snack. This more recent batch I was doing off the top of my head using a sprinkle of cheese. In looking at the recipe (to write this review) I definitely didn't use 1/4 cup of cheese per wrap like I did the first time I made this and YES still a fantastic wrap.",
