I got interested in the recipe because i got braces recently and so i cant really eat corn on the cobs normally (however much i love them!) Ok i think this recipe yould be awesome: WITH these adaptions: Instead of the garlic powder use 3 cloves of garlic crushed. Use 1 whole red pepper. Use 1/2 the lime reccomended. So im giving it a good rating mainly because i believe that with these alterations this would be a brilliant recipe. We actually served this warm instead of as a salad and it worked out fab.",
