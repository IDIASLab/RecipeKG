I\u2019m going to follow the video more than the recipe next time and will hope for success!  Two main differences are that the recipe doesn\u2019t say to put them in the oven to rise and it also does not specify to whisk all ingredients by hand, not with the whisk attachment for your mixer.  My mixture wasn\u2019t getting as \u201cfoamy\u201d as it should in the first step and I think that\u2019s why!",

These turned out great! I didn't get 12 out of the recipe but I wanted to make sure they were big enough to hold the sandwiches. Only deviation was I used a beaten egg rather than egg whites for when they were called for but that was just out of laziness...still worked. Will definitely make this again!!",
