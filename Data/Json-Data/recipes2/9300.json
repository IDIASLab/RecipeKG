This recipe is so easy to whip together and delicious! The first time we made it the flavors didn t come through enough for us but my grill master thinks it was his fault on the charcoal grill 2 years ago as he was rushing (too much smokey type char flavor). Finally made this recipe again last night as I had cilantro to use up and was short on time. Followed exactly as written and it s a hit in this house! Squeezed a little lime on top of the chicken at the end after brushing on the sweet chili sauce makes this recipe even better. We served with arroz verde (leftovers) and grilled broccoli. Thanks for the recipe bd.weld!",
