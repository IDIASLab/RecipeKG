I blended the beans, tomatoes and onions in a food processor so that there wouldn't be any chunks. (I did this to hide them from my son. He had no idea beans were in them!) I used a whole egg and added about 1/3 cup of bread crumbs. Also, I used 1 T dried parsley. I made them on the George Foreman Grill, and they held together and stayed moist. Thanks for an awesome recipe!",

I used kidney beans ( only because I grabbed the wrong can and didn't notice till I got it open), a whole egg because I hate having leftover yolks, and added some oatmeal to counteract the extra egg.  I did freeze them, more because I was never intending to cook them all at once anyway than being worried about the patties holding together.  The end result is great!!! Makes very good burgers, also good cold sandwiches.  I am eating a leftover patty with honey-mustard spread in  a sandwich while writing this, it's excellent.",
