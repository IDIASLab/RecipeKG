It baked up looking a bit rustic (for lack of a better word) and the texture was unlike any quick bread I ve ever made unfortunately not in a good way. It was dense dry almost biscuit-like and as hard as it is for me to say this simply didn t have much flavor even with 1 cup of good-quality maple syrup. It s the Holiday Season so we re a bit more indulgent but at 404 calories and 63.3 carbs this just was not worth the indulgence. The only way I could find to use this today was to use it like shortbread under some freshly-sliced strawberries with LOTS of juice. Hate to give a bad review as the first reviewer but this was a disappointment and I won t be making it again.",
