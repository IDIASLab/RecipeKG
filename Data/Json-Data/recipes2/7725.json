I went to a local donut shop and asked for an unglazed raised donut. I used a serrated knife and cut my donut in half. I placed my butter in my skillet to melt, placed the donuts cut side down onto the melt butter. I used two slices smoked Gouda because I bought them sliced on the #2 setting at a local grocery. Perfect to allow the cheese to melt, without the donut being burned.\nI\u2019m not sure I would make this again, even though it was so unique and tasty.",
