Don't expect a really sweet dish if you aren't accustomed to eating Paleo, but I love the flavors, and it's sweet enough for me as is.  I also aded a dash of vanilla.  Using really ripe bananas will make it sweeter if that's your preference.  I like the ones that are just beginning to get a few spots on them but are still firm.  Thanks for the recipe!",
