It did take about 1 hr 15-20 min to reach a temp of 160 but I m sure that s because it was cooked in a smaller pan making it a little taller. In the future think I'll try baking @ 375 instead of 350 and hopefully shorten the baking time. I do agree with one of the reviewers that the slices tended to fall apart so I would use 1/2 cup of bread crumbs next time (used Panko) which should correct this issue. It does seem like a lot of poblano peppers but don t cut the number back because they re a really important part of this recipe. Loved the combination of poblanos dates goat cheese and the BBQ sauce. Served with dijon roasted potatoes sauteed green beans and sliced tomatoes. Tera_J this is certainly is an outside-the-box meatloaf and we thoroughly enjoyed it!",
