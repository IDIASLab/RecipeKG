We've been trying to eat local foods in season, and all winter I avoided parsnips except mixed in with lots of other veggies to the point where you can't even taste them.  Finally, I saw what is probably the very last parsnips of the season, and I decided that I had to stop being a wimp and give it a go.  And boy am I glad I did.  Even one of my 2 year old twins ate this up, which felt like a small miracle.  My only problem now is that I'm going to have to wait until next winter to eat this again.  Well, I guess it's good to have things to  look forward to in the winter!  Thanks for the delightful recipe!",

I just fried them in butter/olive oil with salt & pepper and it was exactly what I have been searching for all of these years. Thanks for sharing!",
