I was so pleasantly surprised! the taste is wonderful. You can appreciate the true taste of the duck and the rosemary was just the icing on the cake. I used a large Mulard Duck Breast and adjusted the recipe down to 2 servings. Warning be careful when adjusting the recipe because the actual preparation instructions include quantities that correspond to the amount of servings in the original recipe. No harm really you may just have leftover rub or sherry that you won't use. GREAT GREAT GREAT (at least to me anyway:-) Thanks for sharing!",

I did need to add water to the roasting pan after the first two hours to prevent burning. This was the first duck I ever prepared. It was okay but I probably won't make this again.
