You can vary the amount of salt you use but you should be pretty generous with the amount you coat on the ribs. The salt just cuts the fat away! These are also tasty as leftovers. Just steam them for 5 minutes and they're as good as right off the grill! Definitely one of the best rib recipe's I've ever tried!",

I can definitely see where very few people would like this. Just scale it and go buy a small pack of short ribs (beef). Thats what I did. Gotta love Sam's for that:)",
