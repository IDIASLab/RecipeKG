Sea bass Halibut Cod or any type of white fish 1\" thick minimally will work well with this recipe. How to determine if your fish is cooked: Use a fork to poke the flesh of the fish to see if it separates easily. It should be white and not translucent. When finished place the plate in the kitchen sink. (Why? Because when you pour hot oil over the fish it will splatter all over). As an alternative for steaming put fish on a plate on top of 2 green whole green onions. This will prop the fish up so air flows beneath it put plastic wrap over the fish and then into the microwave oven. Microwave on high for about 5-6 minutes; check for doneness as noted above. Try serving with Stir Fried Snow Peas and Mushrooms from AR for a great low calorie low carb dinner. Family loves this one!",
