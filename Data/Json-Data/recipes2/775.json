Since I don't have much whole wheat baking experience, I did what any good chef would do: I didn't do any research and just tried to figure it out. I was quite happy with the taste and texture, and going 50/50 with the all-purpose flour provided just enough of that crusty, chewy 'normal' bread experience.",

I also let the sponge sit for a full 24 hours instead of 12 (due to a busy schedule) and I noticed no change in taste or texture.\nInstead of a loaf, I made them into sandwich sized loafs. I would reduce the baking time down to maybe 20 mins at the most as the crust for these loafs were too crunchy for my liking. I didn\u2019t spray the tops with water. Not sure if that would have changed anything other than that way it\u2019s looks. \nGood recipe for crunchy bread.",
