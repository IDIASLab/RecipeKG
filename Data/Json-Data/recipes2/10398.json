I added mayo to both slices of bread which did help. Next time I will skip the tuna mixture altogether and just make a bacon lettuce avocado and tomato sandwich. I might try adding mayo to the tuna mix and use that alone for plain tuna sandwiches. I just didn't like the combination of a BLT and tuna sandwich I guess.",
