Further if your are using a thicker cut of meat I would suggest searing the steaks on both sides and finishing in a hot oven (obviously use a oven-proof pan). This provides much beeter results with the meat as opposed to an excessively long pan-fry as noted. The oil made from the sage rosemary and thyme is great!",

I halved the salt, used margarine instead of butter, and used half and half. It was a little bit salty, but that's because I didn't \"clarify\" the margarine. To ignite the brandy, I lit the end of an uncooked linguine noodle and put the tip in the sauce. I also made the roux, but thought the sauce was thick enough after adding the half and half. I used the top round steak, which ended up a little tough. I would suggest buying a better cut. The sauce was SO good, though, that the meat toughness almost didn't matter!",
