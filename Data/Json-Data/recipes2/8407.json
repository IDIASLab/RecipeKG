Make sure to stir the potatoes constantly when its in the skillet; i was occupied with something else and almost burned the seasoning off but it still came out wonderful.

My only worry was that without any grease the beef and the potatoes would stick to the pan. I was right, so I used a bit of vegetable oil no more than a tablespoon for the entire recipe more or less. I used a teaspoon for cooking the beef and 2 teaspoons for cooking out through the rest of the recipe.  Hopefully next time I try it, I won't forget the spice!",
