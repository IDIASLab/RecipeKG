I reduced the balsamic to a sweet syrupy consistency which was decadently rich.  My chicken breast was HUMONGOUS, so I pounded it out a little, spread the goat cheese on it, drizzled some balsamic, and then rolled the chicken breast which made for a really nice presentation when sliced.  I think the goat cheese filling was longing for some other ingredients, so I will try that the next time.  Sauteed some mushrooms and topped the chicken breasts when serving.  We liked this, but I think it needs a little tweaking (but not much) to reach 5 stars.",
