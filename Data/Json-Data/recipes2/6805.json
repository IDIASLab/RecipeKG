And I am not sure what milk powder is...she used malt powder. For every play date quick snack late night sleep over.....whatever the occasion she would whip these up and they are so good. This recipe brings me back 15 years to my childhood. Thanks for sharing I think I am going to make these!",

This is not intended to replace peanut butter balls candy (in which graham crackers are entirely welcome) so if you're looking for that flavor this might not be the recipe for you. As a reasonably high-protein tasty sweet snack these hit the spot. FYI use milk chocolate chips semi-sweet tastes a bit out of place with the honey IMO! Thanks for sharing your recipe!",

I used natural pb and mini chocolate chips. I changed the servings to 6 with the calculate button and got 7 pb balls. It did satisfy my sweet craving anyhow.",
