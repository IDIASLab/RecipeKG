I pounded out the chicken and used 1/4 cup of flour and didn't even use all of it. I seasoned the flour with salt and pepper. I sprayed the pan generously with Pam and sprayed the side of chicken facing up after I put the chicken in the pan. I fried the chicken til done and removed them.I added 1/4 cup of triple sec orange liquor to deglaze the pan and added 1/4 cup heavy cream and 1/4 fat free milk. I added a splash of the lite syrup from the oranges and 1/4 cup of OJ. I used an 11oz. can of mandarin oranges (the whole can drained)I reduced it a little bit. I served it with broccoli and brussel sprouts and wide egg noodles. Yum Yum! p.s. I also added more salt it needs salt!",

The other reviews didn't mention this so maybe it was the brand (Festival). I doubled the recipe cut the chicken into bite-size pieces and used penne pasta. I subbed brandy extract and O.J concentrate (quite a bit) for the orange liqueur. I had to add salt and pepper to this as it was a little bland. Hit each serving with a dash of cayenne. I may try this again with a different brand of Mandarins as my husband really loved it. Thanks!",
