We love bacon, but I left it out figuring that the skin wouldn't get crispy. Ended up with very tasty chicken, and crispy skin. Bacon wasn't needed! Nor is any additional sauce.\nI only used 1/4 of the pesto/mozzarella (total of 2 tablespoons pesto and 1 tbsp. mozzarella). I first inserted the pesto/mozzarella; try to open the pocket where a flap of skin can be tucked under the thigh. Then enlarge the pocket over the thigh leaving the rest of the skin attached to the thigh. Spread around the pesto/mozzarella, then tuck the skin flap under the thigh. \nThen I sprinkled on the seasoning, \nYes, I'll make this again - it is terrific and easy!",

I unrolled the thighs & divided the mixture on each. Then rolled & wrapped a piece of bacon around it like a bacon-wrapped filet bacon touching the chicken \"side \" not the pesto & secured with a toothpick. Placed on baking dish. Cut pieces of uncooked bacon to lay over pesto & raw chicken that was visible in an attempt to have the chicken not be dry/hard. At that time I realized I hadn't seasoned the chicken at all. 'Considered sprinkling with spices then but didn't. There really wasn't a need anyway. The pesto & bacon seasoned it nicely. Baked twenty minutes at 350. To the oven I baked white rice for thirty & had a nice dinner. Fancy-ish but not too timeconsuming. Yay!:D",
