                "reviewBody": "I d give this a 5 for taste and a 2 for the recipe as written because I think there s something wrong. Since the recipe doesn t say if the can of corn should be drained I used it with the liquid. What I ended up with was a bowl of batter that ran all over the place when dropped onto the griddle (threw the first batch out). I used a box of Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix which is 8.5 oz. The recipe calls for 6.5 oz of cornbread mix so I measured it out on the scale. I ended up adding the rest of the Jiffy mix hoping to thicken it...still runny. I think you either need to cut the milk in half (at least) if you re not draining the can of corn and if you use Jiffy use the entire pkg or simply drain the corn. The consistency of the pancake was almost like a crepe and I would have preferred something a bit thicker. On the positive side they are very tasty easy to make and I do think it s worth trying again. Just use your best judgment on the consistency of the batter.",
