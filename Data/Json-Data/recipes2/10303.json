I'm really not sure what's needed, but 1/4 cup grated is a lot, and you puree the soup anyway, so I would think minced???  Admittedly, I've only had carrot soup several times in my life, but it's always been creamy/thick, so that's what I expected.  Even after cooking the soup down for another 30 minutes after adding the half-and-half, it was still too thin, at least for me.  I love Kitchen Basics, it's the only stock that I buy, but I didn't find this soup to have a lot of flavor.  Could be the confusion over the fresh ginger, perhaps not enough was added??  Just a bit of a disappointment.  Think I'll stick with a couple butternut squash recipes from AR that I like.",

I used a 2\" piece of root and found it gave the soup a good sharp zing although the grated ginger was nowhere near 1/4 cup. I love the flavour combination and couldn't believe that such a small amount of cumin set off the ginger so beautifully. Used a home-made stock and found no need to add salt. Will definitely serve this to company!",
