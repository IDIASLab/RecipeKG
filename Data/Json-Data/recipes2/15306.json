                "reviewBody": "Do not turn your oven on until the rice is done. Put the water on for the rice and onions before you do anything. It will boil while you prepare the other ingredients. The onions take the longest.. 10 mins to boil the water 15 mins to boil 5 mins to cool down 5-10 mins to core them. Serving size varies GREATLY on these. It all depends on how many layers of the onion you core out. You will need much more stuffing than what is listed for the 6 serving size (display servings). Double the recipe and you should be good for 3-4 people (if they eat the whole onion too) anything left over.. put in the freezer and you can stuff peppers with it one night. The display servings fed only me and my 120 lbs girlfriend. Do not waste the butter on the outside of the onion. If you have more than one layer which you probably will basting the outside won't matter as it will all end up in the bottom of the pan. Mix it in with the stuffing or pour it on the stuffing while in the onion. I ended up eating the inside with the layer that it cooked in so the outside layer with all the butter went to waste. Oh yeah the onions were still very raw. May want to saute the shells a little before stuffing (not sure if this is even possible;p). Taste: Sub standard. My girlfriend said it tasted a little like Jambalaya. They were definately lacking something. Try to spice it up or throw a good cheese into them. Maybe a little cayenne or a good gouda.",

Next time I'll put in 1.5 times the meat and half the rice and breadcrumbs. We had too much filling (maybe my onions were too small) I ended up assembling a freeform onion with the left over inner layers. I put some cheese on it for the last five minutes and it added to the flavor. It works well with sweet Italian turkey sausage but I had to add a tsp of olive oil to cook the onions and peppers since it was low fat. We plan on making it again with the mentioned changes. Nice flavorful dish--we used it as a main course with some couscous.",
