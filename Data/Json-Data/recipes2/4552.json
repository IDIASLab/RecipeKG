The batter is so loose that the Snicker exploded within 2 seconds of hitting the oil. I made this 3 times in attempt to get it right. First time= inedible. The second time I did my best at thickening up the batter and it was better but still not okay. The third time was a charm or my best attempt you could say but I will never attempt this again. What I did: Freeze your Snickers as in frozen solid. 1 cup of flour 1/2 cup of the sugar NO egg vanilla and 1/2 cup of the club soda. This eventually worked ok but I was totally over it after wasting so many ingredients trying to make it work. It might be an editing error but as written this does NOT work. At all.",
