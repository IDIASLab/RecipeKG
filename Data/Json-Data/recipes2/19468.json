After reading the reviews that the chicken needed a bit more of a kick I added 1/4 tsp. curry (since it goes so well with coconut) a dash of red pepper and a little garlic to my chopper while everything was grinding. I also kept my chicken breasts whole and double dipped them in the coating so they'd be nice and crunchy and cooked them on a rack on a baking sheet so I wouldn't have to flip them. Even the people that don't like coconut liked this one--I gound everything so finely they could only taste the sweetness of the nuts without the texture that they don't like. After my alterations it is 5 stars all the way.",

The final product had a nice crunchy texture and wasn't too sweet at all. We liked it quite a bit but it did seem to need some extra seasoning.

I ground the pecans and coconut with a little curry and garlic powder before tossing the mixture with the panko. Then I baked them as directed. Great.
