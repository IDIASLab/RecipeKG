Red velvet isn't supposed to be a \"chocolate\" cake so if you're expecting that, you'll be let down. I think the addition of more cocoa gave it a little more flavor but didnt make it very chocolatey, so I'll give the recipe 4 stars. if I hadn't added more cocoa, I believe it would have been lacking in flavor. \n\nSome complained about the icing being too sweet. My favorite recipe is 1 stick of softened butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 8 oz cream cheese and 3 1/2 cups powdered sugar. It never lets me down. (This cake will take at least 1 1/2 of that recipe.)",
