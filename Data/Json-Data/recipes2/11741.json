The prosciutto is very delicate and tore easily when cutting in half lengthwise or when wrapping around but worth it! Using a silicon brush, brushed each bundle with the olive oil. Repeated using the same brush when they came out of the oven for the balsamic. The cook time was spot on (7 min) and they looked so beautiful and tasted even better! Didn\u2019t do this but could see fresh grated Parmesan sprinkled over all all and returned to the oven for one more min but? Not needed - and only a maybe idea for next next time. As is, delicious! Felt like we were celebrating something special as we ate dinner tonight! Thank you for posting this!",
