Then added the sauce to the salad and mixed it together.\n~ Sprinkled chia seeds on top of salad when I served it.\n\nI'm sure this recipe is just as delicious as written without the \"tweaks.\"  I made this salad last night and it was so good, I could not wait till today for another serving.  Ha!  I am FEASTING on my second helping and am so enjoying it that I just had to write a review.  This salad is OHHHHH so delicious, refreshing and delightful...
