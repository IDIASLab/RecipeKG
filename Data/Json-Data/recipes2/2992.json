This Pasta Fredda Caprese style was good and satisfying (and a dish after my own Italian heart). Loved the addition of the black olives and the bit of fresh oregano! I used the smaller ciliegine mozzarella and perhaps a tad more olive oil than the submitter directed tho' I have no doubt she never intended for it to be strictly measured and not just simply drizzled to taste! It wasn't specified so I just chose to tear the basil into small pieces. I served this at room temperature as tomatoes and mozzarella should be and all it needed was my fork and a few shakes of salt and pepper! As the first reviewer of this recipe I enthusiastically give it two thumbs up with the hopes it may inspire many others to give it a try. I have no doubt you won't be disappointed.",

Now that we live in the southwest the summers are a little to hot to make a sauce all the time, so I'm always looking for a light pasta dish especially since it's just hubby and myself.  This did not disappoint! I used tri-colored tortellini and added a few cloves of garlic. Also used a good flavored olive oil and a couple splashes of Sicilian lemon white balsamic vinegar. Also added Parmesan cheese to the finished product. My hubby does not like olives!!! But I told him to just pick them out . He loved it! Thanks for a easy and delicious recipe!",
