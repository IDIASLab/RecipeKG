The meatballs were tender and the fresh ginger root and lemon grass puree really popped. Wonderful layers of flavor in this recipe. Red curry paste can be a bit assertive but the coconut milk perfectly mellows it out. The sauce had just the right amount of kick for us. Over the past couple years we have developed a taste for Asian food and this Thai recipe is a nice addition to my collection. Company worthy meal for sure!",

Also no peanut oil so I used sesame oil (combined with canola for frying the onion). I also baked the meatballs in a foil-lined pan at 400degF for 20 min. To the sauce I also added a few tsps of sugar to cut the acidity as well as a frozen cube of garlic and two of basil (always hear basil used in Thai dishes). Served with jasmine rice. Something different and good that I will surely make again. Leftovers will be enjoyed as well. Thanks!",
