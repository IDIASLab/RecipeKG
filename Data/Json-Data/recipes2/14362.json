I used a little more cheddar than called for substituted half the flour with arrowroot powder (my thickener of choice) and threw in a small onion minced and cooked in olive oil with some herbes de provence and lots of garlic powder deglazed with some Jack Daniel's. I also roasted the eggplant ahead of time instead of boiling and since I didn't have any poultry seasoning I used seasoned salt cumin and more garlic powder. I can't believe how great this tastes.",
