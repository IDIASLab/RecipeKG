The only thing I changed is I pinched little sections of Jennie-O turkey italian sausage out of the casing and formed into little meatballs. Browned them in a separate pan and added them to the onions & garlic after sweating them. The meatballs really made it into a meal. It tasted awesome. I also think the adobo spice is a must! This recipe is a keeper!",
