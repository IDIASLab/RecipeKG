The good news is that you can have a 4.5 star Tres Leches cake with a few simple changes.  For the cake you'll need to use 5 eggs instead of 3 and adjust the water accordingly.  Depending on the size of your eggs this means you'll use 1/3 to 1/2 cup of water instead of 1 cup.  Using more eggs gives the cake a much better texture.  For the syrup get rid of the 1 cup half and half and use 2 cups regular milk instead.  This gives you more syrup that's not as sweet and greasy.  \n\nSince this recipe uses a cake mix (with very delicate cake flour) there's probably no way to get the texture up to a 5-star rating. By adding more eggs its pretty good though.  This modified recipe is quick and easy so it will have a place in my collection.",
