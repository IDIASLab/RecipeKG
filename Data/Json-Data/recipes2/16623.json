I made exactly as directed except for the olives then let it sit in the fridge to marinate. It does need some salt and pepper and maybe a little oregano. With just the wine vinegar it is a little flat. I think that the feta and the olives should give it a little salt but I omitted the olives (was all out) and my feta just wasn't salty. Really light and refreshing and a great warm weather treat! Thanks for sharing.",
