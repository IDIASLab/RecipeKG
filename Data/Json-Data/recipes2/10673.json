But looked several places so I used cran juice in place of the orange juice and frzn orange in place of the cran. Worked great. No pomegranate seeds so added in POM juice...Can't wait till Sunday!",

It initially had a grapefruity taste but I sweetened it with a bit of sugar and some 7UP. Didn't have tonic water or pomegrante. It does surely sneak up on you too! I think serving it with lots of ice helped calm down the initial bitey taste. Overall with some tweeking this could be a good party drink.",
