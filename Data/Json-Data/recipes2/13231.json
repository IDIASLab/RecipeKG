I plan to make again next week with the recommended soy milk and try again.\n\nSo I have creamy yogurt.  I used organic natures soy and yogurt. Both sweetened vanilla.  \n\nPut in two jars and cooked in Instant-Pot with loosely applied lids for 13 hours.\n\nHere is the fun part.  When it took out the jars there was goo floating in water.  This yogurt first timer was a bit freaked out.  I didn\u2019t dump it I\u2019m not a quitter....\n\nLeft in refrigerator overnight and today I strained my yogurt aka goo through some cheese cloth like ricotta.  \n\nWell once I stirred the heck out of it I now have yogurt.  \n\nIt tastes ok....for those of you like me that like sweetened soy get the unsweetened and add something.....honey... maple....both.  The sugar becomes a little odd.  Just my recommendation \n\nI will make again next week and report back with a comparison",
