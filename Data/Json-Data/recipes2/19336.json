The directions were great and I followed them to the letter.  OK...so all I can think was flavor was not there. I am usually the one that everyone considers the \"great cook\" but this one was not a winner for me.  Perhaps - if I see other people LOVE it - I will analyze why I did not and give it another try.  I hope to see more dutch oven things - because THAT  (cooking outside) part was fun!",

I make up a proper Bechemel sauce with butter flour and milk and then add ricotta cheese. So cheesy! I've never been a fun of broccoli and cauliflower in a lasagna so I use bell peppers onions mushrooms and any other veg that looks good. Also you can add meat if you are so inclined. I only put in on the coals for about 30 -45 min. Letting a lasagna stand is key so don't rush it.",
