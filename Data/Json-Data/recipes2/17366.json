I only helped her when she got a little confused on why it looked like shredded cheese with mayo and pimento. So here's the adjustment. We took out a hand mixer to break down the cheese and get it like the bought version you get at the local grocery store...This helped a lot. It lacked something, but didn't add salt or pepper, we added 1/2 tsp of paprika and to Emily's taste it worked. She was so proud of her self that, she wants to make this again.",

I have alot of jarred pimentos from my summer garden and decided to make this for a party. I doubled the recipe and made it exactly as written. I did not measure out the full one cup of mayo I just added it a little at a time until it was how I wanted it. Like the first reviewer I used a hand mixer to help incorporate the cheese. I did use a block of extra sharp cheddar and shredded it myself since I have read that the bagged shredded is no good for this kind of recipe. I did also add some of the juice from the peppers just to add more flavor. Just a few splashes maybe 3 or so tbsp of it. This was WONDERFUL! I love it! This will definitely be made again!",
