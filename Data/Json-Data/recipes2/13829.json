This couldn't even be called \"sugar free\"   If you've never prepared meals for a diabetic be very careful and understand the power of carbs.    Especially Simple carbs.  The carbs in this recipe aren't exactly the most diabetic friendly along with the refined sugar.  If this were served after a meal which already had carbs in it you risk jacking up their blood sugar levels beyond their target numbers after a meal.  They need to know in advance all the carbs for an entire meal including a dessert so they can decide how much insulin they need if they are doing an Insulin:Carb ratio shot before meals.   If you really want to reduce this to a diabetic friendly pie take the time to find a low carb sugar free crust. There are shortbreads out there for that.  Non fat or 2% milk and sugar free whipped topping.  Add some splenda in the whipped topping for taste.  Be very careul with canned fruits.  Make sure no sugar has been added.  Pineapple is a high glycemic fruit.  Going with strawberrys may be better.   The sugar free vanilla is fine.  We have a diabetic in our family and we are picky about Carb counting.  If you go with this recipe as written the milk, whipped topping and gram crackers could easily skyrocket someones blood sugar to scary numbers depending on how they respond to simple carbs.   Be very careful serving this in between meals as well.",

I really did not care for it too much and no one else seemed knocked out of the ball park either. Of course I am not on the stringent diet of a diabetic and I may be more appreciative if I were. If I ever made it again I would add other fruit like maybe grapes strawberries and/ or manderines. It deffinately needs more than just the ingredients listed here. Update: I had a little left over and decided to try to spruce it up some with strawberries and grapes also I added another whole can of pineapple. It made a pretty good fruit salad. I probably will use this recipe again add even more different fruits to it maybe a little bit of coccunut and serve it without the crust.",

It took 4 attempts, and realized that it works better with name brand ingredients.  I used two boxes of Jello brand pudding that was sugar free and fat free.  Also used 1 1/2 cups of 2% milk instead of 1 cup.  Used cool whip brand Lite, and cut the pecans down to 1/2 cup because of the calories.  It came out great.  So for 1/8 of a slice it now has 177 calories, 11 g. sugar, 10 g. fat, 4 g. sat. fat, 17 g. carb's. Now I have the perfect desert-THANKS!",
