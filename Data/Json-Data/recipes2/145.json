I've made it several times now. I used Rancho Gordo's yellow eye beans, which don't need soaking. I start the beans on the stovetop, omitting the baking soda. I also don't add salt or molasses until the beans are starting to get tender. I bake the beans for the first hour and a half, then add the molasses and salt. After the final half hour of baking the beans uncovered, I put the pot back on the stovetop to simmer away any extra liquid while I put a pan of cornbread in the oven. So good! This time I used diced ham instead of bacon.",
