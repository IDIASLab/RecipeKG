Otherwise I did everything according to the recipe and loved it. I think I would intensify the lemon flavor a bit by adding some lemon extract or maybe a teaspoon or so of lemon zest The second time I made it with a white cake mix and added extra lemon zest and extract. Made it an even better dessert. All the grandkids loved it even the youngest ones.",
