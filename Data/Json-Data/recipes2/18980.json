Now of course this is an option and not required however I would first blanch the asparagus because sauteed asparagus has an unattractive brown tint to it.\n\nTo blanch; bring a pot of water to a boil and season with salt. Prep a large mixing bowl(size varies on quantity) fill with ice and cold water. Place asparagus in boiling water for about a minute then remove and put in ice. Let it sit for a few minutes and then remove, pat dry - then saute.\n\nGood Luck & more importantly have fun.\n\n\n\n",
