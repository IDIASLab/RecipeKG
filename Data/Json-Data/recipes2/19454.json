First off, When I floured and seared the meat, I added some ground coriander and freshly ground fennel seed to the flour, salt and pepper mix. I also added a large can of organic diced tomatoes to the stewing liquids. Finally, I agree with one reviewer who said it would be too greasy, so I degreased the gravy at the end by removing the cooked meat to a dish, skimmed the top couple inches of the roasting liquid into a foil bread pan, and stuck it in the freezer for about 20 minutes while I mashed the potatoes and cooked the green beans. Once the fat hardened, I just scraped it away from the juices underneath. (I'm glad I did because it was about a cup of fat! ) Then I added the  juices back to the pot on the stove top, simmering for a few minutes to heat it back up and thicken.",
