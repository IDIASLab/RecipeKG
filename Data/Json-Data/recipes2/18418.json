I omitted the dried chives as I didn't have any (and anyway why bother when you can use fresh?) and also because I couldn't find Greek yogurt I simply spooned regular yogurt into a coffee filter and let the moisture drip away. This leaves the yogurt thick and creamy and not too unlike the Greek stuff. Next time I might add a little finely-minced red onion instead of green. Thanks so much for a great recipe!",
