This recipe definitely gives you that Italian-style food fix without the carbs from pasta.",

Used the leftover filling to do some shells up & that was perfect!! And since alot of posts are about the amount of sodium that's really dependent on your choice of sauce. I happened to have a jar of Ragu's Robusto in the cupboard & used that rather than my usual Barilla. No problems. I will guarantee you will want chocolate or ice cream to clear the palate after this dinner!",
