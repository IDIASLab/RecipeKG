I followed the recipe but I used the zest and juice of two limes and I also added 1 heaping teaspoon of fresh minced garlic, 1 teaspoon of paprika and 1 teaspoon of salt.  In addition, I added 2 tbsp of fresh chopped cilantro and that made the dish.  I served it with rice and fresh green beans and it all turned out perfectly.  On the cooking time, I used my convection oven and baked them at 400 for 30 minutes.  Tented them with foil and let them sit for 10 minutes, they were super juicy.",

I followed the recipe as far as a lot of the spices but instead of chili powder I used Valentina Chili Lime powder. I used a 1/3c. of the oil, 3 chunks from a garlic clove (minced), 1 tsp. of paprika, 1 tsp. of salt, and I zested and squeezed (and got as much out of as I could, insides and all) 2 limes. When I put the chicken on a foiled pan, I scooped out all those good hunks and chunks of stuff from the bag and spooned on top! That\u2019s where all your flavor is! I used the same temperature, and cooked them until they almost looked like they were going to maybe burn and then broiled on high for 3 minutes so they looked roasted and crispy!! Made easy elotes for the side and it was Aaah-mazing!!!!",
