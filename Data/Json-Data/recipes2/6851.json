I haven't used marinades too much and I'm not particularly a steak person but I gave this a try. I used 3 New York strip steaks for this. They marinated for 3 or 4 hours before I grilled the first one. (I left the others sitting in the marinade for the next two days as I had the other steaks.) If it matters to others it's worth mentioning that this is a bit thick for a marinade and not too liquid. The flavor was a nice surprise (I've been disappointed by weak marinades before.) I just may make this again soon!",
