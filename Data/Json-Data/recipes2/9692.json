                "reviewBody": "The best way to describe this is that it is like a crustless sourcream cheesecake but with yogurt. I used lowfat plain yogurt and fatfree sweetened condensed milk without any problem. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and mine baked up in about 25 minutes. It was a bit too sweet for me and if I make it again I will not scrape the milk can clean but just pour in what comes out and see how it is then or if I need to adjust more. My understanding of Bhapa Doi (steamed yogurt) is that it is traditionally made with evaporated milk and is an unsweetened Bengali dessert flavored with cardomom and/or saffron. However I have seen sweetened versions of recipes posted on the internet. This would make a nice presentation baked in individual ramekins.",

I made it for Valentine's Day so I added an Oreo crumb crust and drizzled caramel sauce and chocolate sprinkles on top and I used pecans instead of almonds.

Firms up real nice. Definitely a keeper. Thank you.",
