But.. it went perfect with Ritz crackers to (top it off).... I usually use the bagged-grated (moz cheedar jack) type cheeses. I then used onion mayo and canned jalepeno per taste. I never baked it. Left it in the refrigerator for several hours to let the mixture blend. I took it to school the next day in a bowl and serve it with Ritz crackers.. its delicious!!!When I served it...within 1.5hrs..it was gone. Thats about the fastest recipe to disappear I have made in my 12years. I'll try to bake it next time..interesting. thanks for sharing.",

But the thing that ruined it for me was that after it sat for a few minutes the liquid grease pooled on top of the cheese...a lot of it. Even after I tried pouring it off it was still there and every time I took a bite it was greasy. I don't know if substituting cream cheese for mayo would help or using a non-fat mayo but I wouldn't make the recipe as is again.",
