Cook it until the roots are tender. I love shitake mushrooms and you should make BIG chunks (to taste)  because they shrink in the pan. Don't serve with all the juice, place in a dish and drizzle the sauce so the everything isn't swimming in it like a soup. In addition, I drizzled it with sesame seeds for prestation and it was awesome. The first review is right about salt but not fair. If you're conscious about salt the ingredients in this recipe should have clued you in and shouldn't  bother making it. If you see soy sauce (even low sodium) in the list, skip the recipe.",
