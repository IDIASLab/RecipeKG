I brush both sides of the thinly sliced baguette lightly with the olive oil.  Turn them once, half way through baking.  You're not limited to fresh garlic either - just sea salt is nice, sea salt and fresh ground pepper, grated Parmesan cheese, or even California-Style garlic salt. Just plain would probably be good too!  I guess we use these for just about anything and everything you'd use chips or crackers for!   These keep well in a sealed container and are so much better than the thick, stale things you buy at the store!",

Then used plain olive oil...liked the one with garlic powder better (no surprise). On one sheet, I used sea salt and cracked black pepper. The other sheet, some with rosemary, others with fresh parsley. Just a very light sprinkling of add-ons does the job. Turn over half-way while baking. I use these a lot with salads, but they're great for snacks or with cheese, etc. So much better than the store-bought stuff. Thanks Emily, great recipe! UPDATE 3/2/16: Used garlic-flavored olive oil and topped with salt, pepper, etc for half of the crostinis I made today, and they came out great! Also lowered oven temp to 350, doing 8 min per side.",
