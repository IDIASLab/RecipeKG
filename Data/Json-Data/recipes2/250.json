I use a cup of plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and nobody in the family was the wiser, two cans of black beans (they're healthy, so why not), and I add a 4 oz can of green chilis.  It's a great recipe, so yummy. And thanks to a pintrest idea I saw shredding chicken is easier than ever.  Place HOT chicken breast into a bowl, get your hand mixer, set on low speed and shred away.  I place aluminum foil on the bowl and make a hole big enough for the mixer so as not to have shredded chicken all over the kitchen.  Works great!  :)",
