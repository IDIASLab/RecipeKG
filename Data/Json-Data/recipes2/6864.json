He later used this at Blackstone Hotel in Kansas City, Drake Hotel in Chicago, and when he was Executive Chef at the Hotel Utah in Salt Lake City (where he was featured in Gourmet Magazine). This recipe won countless awards and was in national cooking magazines. Not as easy as other Caesar dressing recipes, but worth the effort! I guarantee it! Julia Child has a great Caesar dressing recipe, but this recipe beat hers in one contest. Chef Gerard suggested letting this dressing stay in the refrigerator for 2 days for better flavor. Optional, but suggested.",

                "reviewBody": "\"Chef Gerard's Award Winning Caesar Salad Dressing\" met my expectations: I had hoped to be able to make a delicious gluten-free (no croutons) dairy-free (no Parmesan cheese) \"Caesar Salad.\" I used white burgundy and white wine vinegar. I taste tested 4 brands of commercial stewed tomatoes for this recipe. I found \"President's Choice\" (\"Original with Onions Celery and Garlic\" and \"Stewed Tomatoes with Italian Seasonings\") to be superior to \"Alymers\" (\"Diced Tomatoes with Italian Spice\" and \"Aylmer Accents with Italian Seasonings\"). I chose \"President's Choice\" Original (no Italian seasonings). I followed the recipe instructions exactly (mortar and pestle mixer - no blender) to give it a rustic presentation (tiny bits of bruised herbs throughout). On the first day I found that the flavor of my cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil overwhelmed the other salad-dressing ingredients. I WOULD DEFINITELY USE A LIGHTER OLIVE OIL NEXT TIME. On the third day the flavor had mellowed out and I balanced it with a little extra wine. I had made 2 \"Caesar Salads\" using this dressing for a birthday party (both with romaine lettuce bacon and room-temperature salad dressing): (i) a gluten-free dairy-free (GF/DF) version (with chickpeas and red onion); and (ii) a \"regular version\" (with croutons and Parmesan cheese). Ironically everyone really enjoyed the GF/DF version (4 or 5 stars) but not the version with cheese (3 stars). Thank you Bueny for sharing your dad's recipe. RECIPE GROUP",

I had never made nor eaten a \"Caesar salad dressing\" using these unique ingredients and was pleasantly surprised. By using my immersion blender I created a creamy dressing by blending all of the ingredients together. The dressing was a little tart for us so I added 1 t. of sugar. Thank you Bueny for sharing your father's recipe. It is definitely a keeper for me. This was the Buzz Recipe Group selection for April 11 2015.",

I was not wowed by the flavor of this dressing but of course that could just be a matter of preference.

I enjoy trying new things and \"non-traditonal\" ingredients or preparations have never scared me off they inspire me. But I have to say this unique twist on a Caesar dressing didn't work for me. I did halve the recipe but used exact measurements. It's extremely thick and after 36 hours in the fridge this was tomato paste consistency. After warming a lots of shaking it came up to dressing consistency. Biggest concern an overwhelming olive oil taste. I used a very good EVOO. After adding some anchovy paste and kosher salt I felt I could serve this but hubs was disappointed with his salad. That makes me sad.
