The less, it will be more softer and fluffy more custard like.  4 cups make a thick cake.  2 cups will make it really fluffy.  When grating fresh cassava, one pound will yield about 1.5 cups and the grated product will have a mushy consistency.  I added 1/2 cup of dried sweetened coconut flakes.  It is better to add jarred macapuno strings, or fresh coconut.  It is also better to reserve a couple tablespoons of condensed milk and coconut milk to add as a topping at the last 15 minutes of baking.  Thanks so much for the formula my friend.  Very delish.",

Don't know how old they are and how long they have been sitting at room temperature at the store.  Also, all the food color we don't need to consume.  \n\nThis recipe allows me to enjoy Asian desert made simply at home. It stays soft and chewy warm or cold. I was able to get a bag (2lb./32oz) of frozen yucca at a local Indian grocery store.  I thawed, rinsed and drained the yucca in a colander.  In a blender, I placed the yucca, 12 oz of water instead of evaporated milk, coconut milk and process until smooth.  If you do not have a large blender (Vitamix), you may need to do two batches.  In a large bowl, whisk together the egg and condensed milk.  I also added 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut flakes. Pour the yucca mixture into the bowl and blend them together well.  Coat a 3 quart casserole pan with non-stick spray.  Bake for 1 hour and 10 mins. until the edge is golden.  Will make this again, can't stop eating until my stomach is bloated.",
