I think it needs minced onion which the store-bought packet I used to buy has. Also in place of the seasoning salt I think a beef bouillon cube would give it the needed flavor for ground beef tacos. I also thought it had too much cornstarch. I sprinkled some of this on fish that I was grilling and it tasted great. It's still better than store-bought packets and you can play around with the spices to find what you like.",

But needed more than 'Cook's Note.\" Used whole recipe.\" I tugged about 1 lb's worth of chicken to shred off of a rotisserie chicken and put it in a skillet w/ the directed 2 TB of the above seasoning mix (which ultimately needed a bit of oregano in the end and was very good just not quite up to par w/ AR's Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning I). Ended up using the entire recipe's worth of seasoning along w/ water and simmered just as one would w/ ground beef then served them in lettuce boats w/ cheese tomatoes and onions. Very good and certainly not difficult to put together and way better than any store-bought packet but doesn't quite nail the ratio of spices that \"Taco Seasoning I\" does. Glad that we tried and would be more than glad to make again another time.",
