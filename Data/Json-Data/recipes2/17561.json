Believe it or not, the stuff floating around in the air is enough to produce a great sour dough starter and, according to sour dough aficionados, the only way to make \"real\" sour dough.  Just take care of the yeast, no metal, anywhere from 60 to 80 degrees F temp is the best for beginning the starter.  If it is too hot you can get weird things growing, too cold, well it just takes a while to get going.  Follow the directions and feed your starter.  Store in the refrigerator once it is going and feed every week to keep it alive.",
