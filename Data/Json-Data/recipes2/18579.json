As I was making it I started having strong doubts that this could POSSIBLY be any good and was already formulating possible scathing reviews in my mind!:P Imagine my surprise when I took the first forkful and it was actually GOOD! I used diluted tomato paste instead of ketchup since I was out of ketchup and it was fine; I also put it over some white rice. It was very easy to make. My only complaint is that the recipe vastly overestimates the amount of food that results...there's no way it makes enough for 6! I would double whatever the recipe calls for in order to feed the number you're shooting for unless you're planning to serve it with several sides.",
