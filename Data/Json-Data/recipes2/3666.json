The only one thing I didn't like is that the shredded cheese melted down into the bottom with the sauce so it got kind of lost. When I make this again I will transfer the chicken once it is cooked to a baking sheet. I will then add the shredded cheese and stick it back in the oven under broiler until it is melted and browning. Then I will just ladle some of the sauce onto the bottom toast before adding the cheesy chicken. Overall a great recipe though and a definite keeper!",
