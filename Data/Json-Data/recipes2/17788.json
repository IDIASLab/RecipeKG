I didn't have time to refrigerate it overnight but I did make it early this morning before it got hot and stuck it to set in the fridge all day until dinner. This was good but I think it all depends on how spiced up your ranch is. Make sure you taste test it to make sure it dosen't need more spices before you serve it.",
