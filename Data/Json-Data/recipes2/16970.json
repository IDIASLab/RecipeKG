Yum!\n\n**Also, just a little tip for anyone who hasn't thought of it: Instead of adding the soda into the pitcher, I just topped off each glass with a splash of it as I served them, so the soda wouldn't go flat throughout the evening! This worked great!**",

Then when I moved to Colorado, it was not served and lost touch with this excellent elixir.  Move forward almost 15 years later, I go back to Quebec City just to realize that most people use a prepared mix (like margarita mix) and just add wine; what a travesty!  So I looked up this recipe and...WOW!  For those of you who have read some of my reviews I always make the recipes AS IS, at least the first time.  Well, in this case, I could not find fresh pineapple and did not want the canned version, so I unfortunately had to leave it out.\r\nThe outcome.... even a doubled recipe DISAPPEARED in less than a half-hour!  Now I call that a stamp of approval.  Here is a nice little trick though.  If you've macerated the fruit in the brandy for the required amount of time, and don't server a lot of them in the actual drink, you can make a new batch in a pinch.  Ok, it will not be \"as good\" as the first one, but it is better than not having sangria!!!\r\nThank you so much for the recipe and having rekindled my love of sangria.",

I usually use Carl Rossi wine when making sangria simply because I find the fruit balances out the bitterness of the wine and it's very inexpensive! Also a GREAT tip I came across when making sangria (white or red) is to keep it chilled place frozen grapes instead of ice cubes so that the drink will not become diluted as they melt. Cheers!",
