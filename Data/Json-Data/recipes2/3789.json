                "reviewBody": "This main truly was spectacular! Beautifully colored incredibly tender and absolutely delicious. As this was the first time cooking from this recipe I did follow instructions/timing exactly and did use fresh herbs. To ensure I could follow the timing and not let the tenderloin tent to long I did prep for the sauce hours prior to making the sauce. I chopped the herbs (placed in sealed container) and placed the remaining sauce ingredients on the counter for easy access (cream exempt). Just prior to searing the tenderloin I added 1 tablespoon of butter to the oil for additional flavor. The tenderloin seared longer than suggested in order to pull freely from the bottom of the pan. I was concerned the extra time would create a 'crust' on the tenderloin yet it did not. When removed from the oven the tenderloin looked under cooked yet a thermometer confirmed temp around 120 and after tenting for time it took to make the herb sauce the tenderloin was a perfect MR from outside edge to middle. I doubled the sauce only because we are sauce people and when plating the tenderloin placed sauce both on the plate under the tenderloin and on top of the tenderloin. Would not change anything about this recipe. As a note if you do not own a cast iron skillet it may be time to invest in one. Cast iron cooking does increase the flavor and end result of food. Bon Appetit!",
