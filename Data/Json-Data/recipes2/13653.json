I was kinda skeptical but this was a real hit. After his first bite I got \"WOW this is great!\" A real compliment considering that I get the eye-roll when I tell him its a new recipe. I don't like onions but put them in there anyway. You don't need to eat them but it gave it a really good flavor. The meat was done perfect and very tasty. I put a little bit of garlic in there (mainly habit). I served with a little bit of horseradish. Definately a keeper...Thanks!",
