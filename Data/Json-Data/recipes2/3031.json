I used olive oil vs. veg. oil and added a little minced garlic and let this marinade for about three hours just because I had the time and because with marinades sometimes the longer the better. I used fresh pineapple vs. canned (personal preference) also added some vidalia onion along with the red and green peppers and cherry tomatoes. Overall very good!",
