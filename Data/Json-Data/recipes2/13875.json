For example, today I used canned apple pie filling (I pulsed it in my food processor a couple of times to make small apple pieces) and spice cake mix. Then before baking, I topped them with a \"french apple pie\" topping consisting of 1 cup flour, 1 T cinnamon, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter and a handful of chopped pecans (I had a lot left over, I just froze it for later use). Baked them up, cooled them, and dusted them with powdered sugar. Now I have French Apple Pie-Cakes! Yummy!",

These are marvelous. When making them be sure to really grease each cupcake cup before inserting the pie crust and other ingredients. Some of the preserves bubbled over on a couple of mine and it was very difficult to remove the cakes intact. No worries though the damaged ones tasted just as good! I used white cake mix (added extra vanilla) but really any cake mix boxed or homemade will work just fine. Because I was under some time constraints I topped my cakes with canned butter cream frosting but these really need something a little more special. Next time I will take the extra effort and top them off with a really good fluffy frosting. These were a hit with my co-workers (one asked for the recipe and made them for his son s birthday party) and a hit at home. The creative possibilities with this recipe are endless so I ll be sure to make them again and again.",

I didn't frost them in any way and personally I thought they were best like that. I used rasberry preserves but I would certainly like to try other fruits. Also the pie crust is a sturdy base keeping the filling from falling out just be sure to make it thick enough! This recipe was simple and delicious.",
