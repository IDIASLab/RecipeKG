Wow those potatoes were like flavour sponges for the dressing lol. I think serving it warm reminded me slightly of German potato salad. I would make again with possibly trying different veggies or accents in the dressing. Great base ty for posting. Also for people new to posting reviews details are appreciated and very helpful to the rest of us who feed(pun intended) our foodie addictions here daily:-)",
