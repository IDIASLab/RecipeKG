The taste and ease of making it was there though. What I did was use a carton of mushrooms a bunch of green onions a whole green and red pepper a few stalks of celery with the inner stalks and tops a frozen bag of peas and a bag of broccoli (thawed). Next time I would use fresh not frozen broccoli that's what helped turn it to mush. Some crunch would be nice. Omitted the ham. Added some pepper. Using 8 oz. of spaghetti this amount of veggies was plenty it's just the consistency that needs to be worked on. I hate to say adding heavy cream might do it but then it's not something you would eat every day.",

The cream cheese needs to be softened before you put it in the pan. It will incorporate much easier. I added extra milk since it was really thick as is. I also added minced garlic zucchini fresh mushrooms instead of canned carrot sticks onions and tomatoes. I didn't have any red bell pepper so I just used green. And since I added extra milk I used extra parm. I topped it with diced tomatoes and green onions. Very tasty recipe. Thanks.",

So I cooked the vegetables in some canola oil and made the sauce in a seperate pan and boiled the pasta in a seperate pan. I also added garlic and onion to the vegetable mixture and the sauce. Also I added basil and oregano to the sauce too. So the cream cheese idea is a good base but you definitely need to jazz the recipe up a bit. Also I don't see the need for all the butter--I used about 1 tbsp of canola oil to saute my veggies and they were delicious! And I cannot even IMAGINE this sauce on 4 oz. of pasta because we had enough for 1 lb of pasta--but if you like a lot of sauce you may want to use about 3/4 of a pound of pasta. Overall--good base of a recipe just need to add a lot more stuff--but in the end it's great!",
