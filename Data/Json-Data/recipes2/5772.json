To address those issues I decided to use the Pillsbury seamless dough AND I sprinkled garlic powder on the pockets before baking after brushing them with olive oil. I did use the parmesan cheese as well. I made 8 squares with the dough and had no issues whatsoever handling it. DO remember to prick the tops with a fork before baking to vent and therefore avoid the filling spilling on the baking sheet and ending up with a messy and empty pocket. I served this with marinara sauce to dip. Really yummy and very easy.",

I used a spicy basil tomato spagetti sauce instead (yum) and mexican cheese (mixed). Make sure you pinch together the sides and the seam in the middle ON BOTH SIDES! Dont have a cookie sheet like me? Put into a casserole dish and cook for 10 minutes on one side and then 5-10 on the other. You get a really nice crispy crust with warm ingredients. Its a good cheap meal for kids as well.",
