I\u2019ve made this recipe several times now, making adjustments along the way. I would agree with the former reviews that step 8 needs to be altered to 20 minutes total with the turn 10 minutes in and a re-spritz of the water. When I did not alter it the two times previous, the crust was too hard for my taste, but never did they burn with the additional time. Please do not listen to the one review that says it will bake in 6 minutes total- it\u2019ll be raw and inedible.As for why this calls for ounces (which other reviews question) rather than cups is quite simple- it creates a more accurate bake. Chef John did a solid by adding the approximate amount in cups in the Cook\u2019s footnotes, right under the instructions and in plain site. Also, if the dough is too sticky initially, then the instructions clearly state to add additional flour as needed. Furthermore, it says very sharp knife for a reason; it will deflate if you don\u2019t use one. That said, it doesn\u2019t affect taste just the presentation. If you run into any other problems, watching the video provided is quite beneficial.",

                "reviewBody": "This was quite possibly the worst written recipe for directions I have ever encountered. First, we had to figure out what 19 ounces of flour was. Who uses ounces when it should be written in cups? Especially when 19 ounces only amounts to about 2.37 cups. In the end I added about 3 and 1/2 cups of flour. So that was totally off.\n\nThe directions for  how long the bread was to bake was also way off. My first batch was burnt. My second batch I put in for 10 then I spritzed them and then put them in for another ten. So if you have a good oven do not put them in for 20 minutes, spritz and then 10, or they will burn.\n\nI am not sure if it was the spritzing or the pan of water but these also turned out far too crunchy and chewy. \n\nWon't do this one again.",
