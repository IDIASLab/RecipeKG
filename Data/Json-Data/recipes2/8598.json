The only thing that takes time is deconstructing the Brussels sprouts. The salad keeps in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.",

I wanted to plump up the cranberries, so I rehydrated them in a little boiling water for a few minutes. Instead of the cinnamon pecans, I garnished with some toasted slivered almonds which I had on hand.   Very, very nice salad with lovely presentation and just the right amount of sweetness.

I made the salad (including adding the dressing) a day ahead and I'm glad I did.  The dressing definitely helped soften the sprouts.  It was easy to put together.  The most time consuming part was de-coring the sprouts.  Next time I may just try a bag of shredded. Also, the amount of dressing was perfect, none left over. My only complaint is I felt the sprouts were still too chewy.  I may try a quick blanche to soften them a little more next time (like I do with my cold green bean salads).  And there will definitely be a next time; we really enjoyed this salad.",
