Cinnamon allspice and ginger are very strong spices so I'd recommend that you start out modestly and then add more if necessary because once they're in there you can't take them out. I didn't use any frozen fruit so I did add ice I like my smoothies thick. This is one of those \"outside-the-box\" smoothies and I like the fact that it's not loaded with additional sweeteners the fruit takes care of that.",

I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk.",
