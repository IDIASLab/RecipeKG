To get them to the point they are super crisp they get pretty brown BUT the browner they got the better they tasted. They almost got the tang you get from a fried green tomato. I was very impressed with these and plan on experimenting with different flavor combinations. One step that I think would improve this recipe is to toss the sliced zucchini in the salt rather than sprinkle the salt on after they are already on the baking sheet. This would distribute the salt more evenly.  Excellent recipe!",
