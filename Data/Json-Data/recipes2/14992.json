Try these tips though: first, purchase the thinnest pita breads you can find, and pre-toast them, rather than just warm them, in a 400 degree oven. Let them get ever so slightly crisped before topping them. This will result in a much better crust. Second, you can make your own pizza sauce which is much more flavorful than plain tomato sauce. Mix a small can of roasted garlic tomato paste with an 8 ounce can of roasted garlic tomato sauce. It is the perfect pizza sauce in both flavor and consistency, suitable for ANY pizza recipe. These little pizzas were really divine, an excellent appetizer for a party when cut into quarters. YUM!",
