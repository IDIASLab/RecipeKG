They are naturally sweetened with the banana, so make sure your banana is really ripe.  I'd say these are most similar to crepes. I made mine a little bigger (wasn't really sure how much to ladle in the pan) so I ended up with 5 medium sized pancakes.  I found them a little hard to flip because the texture is a little \"sticky\" and they really grip the spatula, so I ended up using 2 spatulas and that worked well. My first couple came out a little dark, but I ended up finding that cooking them at med-low heat (instead of medium) for 2 mins per side did the trick. This one is a keeper! Thank you repeatdreaming for the fabulous recipe!",

I thought they tasted good--didn't even need any syrup or sugar on them; I just put a little more butter on top and my toddler liked them. I doubled the baking powder because the other reviews said how thin they were. I don't know if it helped raise them anymore but it didn't affect the taste at all. I tried using a crepe pan and spread the batter thin and prepared like a crepe. It worked out OK but broke in a couple places. I then tried making them smaller and a little thicker like pancakes and that didn't turn out well at all. (I really didn't have bubbles form or the edges get dry like the recipe says.) I think the best thing would be to make them like small crepes. Keep spreading the batter over the edges so they get thin. I'm not sure if I'll try again or not. Although I liked the flavor they were a bit of a pain to cook. Thanks for the recipe. It is interesting.",

I thought they were just OK but much more like crepes - very thin delicate and way too hard to flip. If they sat on a plate any longer than a few minutes they started to take on an unpleasant rubbery texture so they definitely had to be eaten right away.",
