I had a package of cream cheese so I thought \"Why not?\" \n(BTW don't forget to soften the cream cheese.) I made this per the recipe \nwith the exception of the relish.  When it was processed I split it in half\nand added sweet relish to one half, dill relish to the other. As I suspected\nI liked the dill better, but that's merely a matter of taste. Both were \ndelicious.  I haven't tried adding any other cheeses.  I'm happy with what I \nhave, so I'll leave that to a more adventurous member. \nMany thanks, badbabybeth, for a new twist (at least for me) on an old\nstandby.",
