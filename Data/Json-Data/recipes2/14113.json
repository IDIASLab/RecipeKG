I use frozen peas not canned which you can pre-cook for 5 minutes before use or just toss in frozen. I mix the mushroom soup tuna and 3/4 of the crushed chips together and put in the casserole dish. I use the remaining 1/4 bag of chips on the top and bake covered for 20 minutes until heated. Just like how my sisters and I would fight my kids fight over this dinner and always want seconds.",

Also good with about 1/4 c. chopped bacon added. Additionally tastes very good with crushed tortilla chips instead of potato chips. You don't have to layer the ingredients either... tastes just as good if you put everything together and gently mix it before pouring into the casserole dish. Also mix in 2 or 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise to make it creamier if you like. This is a good basic recipe for tuna casserole that you can easily improvise on depending on what's in the cupboard. NOTE: If you think this recipe is too salty use salt-free chips which are easy to find in any grocery store.",
