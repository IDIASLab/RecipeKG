However I did use only 1-15 oz can of diced tomatoes and 2-15 oz cans of fire roasted tomatoes (yum!) I also used a package of frozen corn cubed (1\") 5 small yukon gold potatoes plus 1 tablespoon of Old Bay Seasoning (the only seasoning I had). I probably could have omitted the black pepper or only put in 1/2 the amount - as it was pretty peppery - but my husband likes pepper. Plus I added about 1 Tbsp of freshly grated parmesan cheese to the top of each serving. I also made corn bread muffins as suggested and it was a delicious combination. Additionally I served with spinach salad made with a shallot and mustard dressing which really complimented the meal. Also make sure to use an extra large skillet or dutch oven as it makes quite a bit. No need to drain - used juices to dunk corn bread in. My husband is not a fan of tomato-based foods except for spaghetti meat sauce; So when he actually said it was tasty - I new it was a hit!",

I used 1 1/2 lbs. ground beef, used half of the called for pepper, added a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, added 1 Tbsp. Italian seasoning, added 1/2 tsp. minced garlic, and used two 14.5 oz cans Italian diced tomatoes. I didn't have to add any water to cover all the vegetables. i had to use a Dutch oven because this recipe makes A LOT. It also took considerably longer than 20 minutes for the potatoes to cook (probably need to cut them smaller next time). Served with cornbread and every raved about it and asked me to definitely make this again!!!!",

In retrospect this would be even more delicious made with Italian sausage instead. I cooked chopped onions and garlic in with the ground turkey. I had to use up a bunch of organic tomatoes so I threw one large one in the blender with some rosemary basil and oregano (to make the \"canned\" pureed tomatoes) in addition to dicing a couple more. I added some chili powder to everything as it cooked. At the last minute I decided to throw in a bit of goat cheese and a can of cannelini beans... I wasn't sure if this would improve the dish or ruin it but they both turned out to be DELICIOUS additions. The end result was mouthwatering... five stars and beyond with these modifications. My husband normally doesn't care for this type of \"one-dish meal \" but he raved about it and went back for seconds. My puppies were crying for it the entire time it cooked! As some others mentioned it took much longer than 20 minutes for the potatoes to cook... I think I cooked the entire thing for 40 or 45 minutes on low. Definitely worth the wait but I wish I'd started earlier.",
