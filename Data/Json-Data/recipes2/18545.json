It was absolutely DELICIOUS and loved by the entire family. They all said this was a definite keeper and to \"PLEASE make it again mom.\" Thanks for the great idea...plus...it was EASY EASY EASY!

The only suggestion I would make is that I think there might have been a misprint with the amount of honey used. 1/4 teaspoon wouldn't even add anything to the taste. I used 1/4 cup and if you like honey (as I do!) a scant 1/2 cup isn't too much to use. I also browned the pork tenderloin in a frying pan and added the sauce mixture right into the pan covered the pan and put it right into the oven - saves some dish washing! I'll continue to make this recipe - thanks so much for sharing it!",

I cooked this at 350 degrees on convection roast for 1 hour and it was cooked through perfectly. Unfortunately I'm going to have to find another recipe for the sauce as we did not like this at all. If you like Russian Dressing then you will like this. Apparently my family does not like Russian dressing in the least and that is all you can taste in this dish. The honey was lost and the onion soup mix seemed to be as well. I gave it 2 stars for the method of cooking and the idea more than anything. the tast of this dish just didn't suit my family's palate.",

Made these in a skillet so I heated the olive oil over medium heat and added the flour-dredged (seasoned with PEPPER ONLY -- there's a lot of salt in the soup mix) chops. Browned on both sides and reduced heat to low-medium. 3. Used Kraft Light Catalina dressing. 4. Added 1 clove of garlic chopped. 5. Used 1/2-3/4 envelope dry onion mix. 6. Accidentally used an 1/8 c honey lol!! They were too sweet but not actually by a lot. Maybe eyeball half of an 1/8 c (1/16) of honey 7. Added sauce over browned pork chops. Flipped occasionally to make sure they got sauce on both sides. 8. Cooked until the chops were done!! Spooned some sauce on top of each one and served with a green salad. 9. There was about 1/2 c sauce leftover after I generously topped my 4 chops so you could probably make 5-6 2 oz pork chops.",
