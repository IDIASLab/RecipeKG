I did a mix of strawberry blueberry and raspberry. I blended them well with the almond milk first to break down any of the raspberry seeds. I also had to use all frozen fruit as that is what I have. That avoided the refrigeration afterwards anyway. I made a 1/2 recipe and tried it with the half of banana as suggested. I ended up adding the whole banana which helped with the tartness. This was very healthy. ty Mottsbella",
