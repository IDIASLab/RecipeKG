Thought the heat was good actually added more Thai peppers than the recipe called for, but not very saucy. Looks good but most of the ingredients were raw (lemongrass, lime leaves and thai peppers) which I think need to be cooked for more flavor. I saut\u00e9ed the garlic and shallots which made it better.  Should saut\u00e9 the lime leaves, thai peppers, paste to have more of a sauce.  Haven't worked with lemongrass much before either, but I think it needs to be cooked to be most effective.\nPicture shows way more sauce than is actually there.",

Yes the sauce is less liquid than in the picture but I kind of like it like that. I used 6 serrano peppers instead because my town doesn't have a lot of asian ingredients at the grocery store. I also saut\u00e9ed the peppers and shallot with the garlic. Then i mixed in 2 tbsp of the chili paste and the lime. It was superb and my family loved it to bits! Just had to tweak the recipe a bit but otherwise delish.",
