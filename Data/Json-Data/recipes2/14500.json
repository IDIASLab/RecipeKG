I had the cream cheese spread out on a pretty glass dish, getting ready to head to a friend's for dinner, when I realized the frozen shrimp I had purchased was BAD.  I quickly stopped at the market on the way to our friend's house and bought the best (1-lb.) can of lump crab that I could find (it's usually in the seafood department and is chilled).  To prepare this, I used a hand mixer and whipped up 2 pkgs. of light cream cheese with a bit of sour cream, parsley, and about 1/2 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning.  Spread this in a large, 1-inch-deep glass serving dish.  Poured the cocktail sauce over the cheese, and then layered the full pound of crab (rinsed first) over the top.  The crab with the cream cheese and cocktail sauce (with wheat thins) was outstanding. l'll make this \"mistake\" from now on!",

Also there were quite some comments that the dip should be taken out of the fridge a couple of hours before so the cream cheese can soften. With this in mind I bought the 8 oz. tub WHIPPING cream cheese instead. It is nice and smooth and does not harden like the regular package of cream cheese does when placed in the fridge. It was very tasty too. My family loved it. Next time as a variety I might buy another kind of whipping cream cheese to add more flavor to the dip.",
