Only after he was done with it did I ask \"Do you wanna know what that was? What was in it?\" Once I told him he replied with a grimace \"Oh THAT'S what that odd taste was.\" Just like a kid. Seriously I did have my doubts but I had all the ingredients on hand as specified in the recipe. And if it didn't work the avocado would have more than likely gotten tossed anyway. It was creamy smooth and different. Delicately flavored so it's hard to isolate what exactly is in it. Pretty light green good for you (avocado is a \"good\" fat) and a creative and different twist on the typical fruit based smoothies. Try it on your hubs - just don't tell him it's AVOCADO he's drinking until it's gone - if ever.",
