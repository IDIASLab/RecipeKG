Get rid of some unneeded ingredients. There is no reason to add that much butter (or, any butter). You already get plenty of salt from the smoked salmon- no need for a greasy filler. Instead, add 1/2 cup sour cream. It will give you the consistency of a spread, mixed with the cream cheese. Since the salmon has PLENTY of salt, you really only need to add the dill & a small dash of the Worcestershire. Do NOT add liquid smoke! That should not be needed if you are using proper SMOKED salmon. And with that, using a minimum of 6-8oz of smoked salmon is necessary. Otherwise, you have double the base & only 4oz of what is supposed to be giving the dish an actual personality & flavor. Don\u2019t cheat on the salmon, and don\u2019t overdo the extras- a good salmon dip is best with the least- from a born & raised Alaskan who grew up on this dish. \nLast, but not the least- refrigerate the dip for a minimum of 1hour prior to serving for all flavors to mesh & the best consistency for serving multiples.",
