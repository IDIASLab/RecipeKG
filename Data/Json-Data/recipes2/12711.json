                "reviewBody": "My boyfriend and I had fun making this in a stovetop pressure cooker. Cooking time for us was rather wonky; I recall it taking way longer than usual to come to pressure (the nozzle rose long before the steady stream of steam came out) and so it was on med-hi heat for like 12 mins before we turned it down to cook for 6 minutes (plus 5 more for natural release followed by 3 mins of quick release)... resulting in dry and weirdly flaky chops - but the excellent flavor made up for it. We scaled it to 5 and even though we didn't have enough onions to match it still turned out stellar. Deglazed the browned pork bits with the apple cider for the start of a nice alcoholic (if you like that kinda taste!) gravy. Mustard really comes through. Didn't have Dijon - used brown but Dijon might be better. Also used fresh rosemary instead of dried - very powerful flavor. Overall loved this recipe for all its fun components! Maple syrup & nutmeg used in a subtle way? Yes please.",
