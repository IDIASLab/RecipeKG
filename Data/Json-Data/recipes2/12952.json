I just didn\u2019t think it was quite thick enough, and didn\u2019t want to end up taking a soupy casserole out of the oven.  The only step I\u2019ll probably skip in the future is frying the shallot rings at the end.  Admittedly, they were good, but this recipe takes some time to prepare, already has a fairly substantial cleanup, and the shallots wouldn\u2019t be a game changer for me.  Honestly, next time I\u2019ll most likely just add some canned french fried onions for about the last five minutes in the oven.  Can\u2019t speak to being made in advance, since I prepared and cooked this today.  But I will say that this is very tasty and company-worthy.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
