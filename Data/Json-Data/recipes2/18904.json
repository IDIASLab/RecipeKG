I increased the amounts by about 50% or so using 1/2 reg. and 1/2 plum tomatoes plus 1 red bell pepper in addition to the green one and 2 jalapenos (1 seeded the other not). Since half was going to be blended anyway I fine chopped 1/2 and the other was course chopped for the blender saving prep time. Speaking of which the listed prep time was VERY conservative more like double for me. Also seeded the cukes and put all seeds in the blender. I think it made for a less watery soup. Served with crusty Italian bread and a bottle of Tobasco sauce on the side and it's a meal itself!",

I didn't like the texture without the vegetable chunks. Also it was an unappealing brown color because of the red of the tomatoes combined with the green of the bell pepper. It seems like a red or yellow bell pepper would give this a more attractive color. Anyway my husband decided that the gazpacho smelled hideous and he wouldn't eat it so it's all mine. It tasted great as a puree but I added some chunks back in to improve the texture and it's terrific! If I make it again though I'll try it as a salad without pureeing at all. UPDATE: I did make this again as a salad. It was delicious but there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of the bowl so I guess it does need to be partially pureed to incorporate that liquid.",
