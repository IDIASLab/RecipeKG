On a whim I decided to check out Alfredo recipes for dinner tonight and found this one. I used Chicken, Broccoli, Red Peppers & Mushrooms. I also made extra Pasta. My husband & I loved it. My husband told me I out did myself with this meal. This was my first try and I can hardly wait to try it again with other vegetables. Maybe even use shrimp like others have suggested. Great recipe with so many options for personal touches.",

This was because I  did not have any roasted Red Sweet Peppers. As a result, I believe my turned out a bit spicier than the original recipe-this is a good thing, as we like spicey/hot foods. Either way I plan on keeping this recipe easy to reach and would sugest trying it atleast once.",
