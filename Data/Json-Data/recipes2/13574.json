Even my kids (2 and 5) are absolutely crazy about this one! I loved it so much I copied the recipe and emailed it on to all my friends and family even received back a ton of complimentary feedback. This is the kind of recipe that gets handed down from generation to generation. The only complaint I have is the standing time. I usually prefer something that can be prep'd and then cooked. But still a WONDERFUL dinner!",

Other than that I followed the directions so I'm not sure what I did wrong. The noodles on the bottom and sides were still chewey/hard. I would have cooked it longer but it already had a brown \"crust\" starting to form on bottom and sides of dish...maybe I overcooked it? I refrigerated overnight and cooked at 375 for 1 hour so I'm not sure. I will try this recipe again (we liked it) but will watch closely while cooking...maybe stirring 1/2 way through cooking time to redistribute the noodles.",
