I had no mushrooms so I grated 3 carrots and one small zuchinni and stirred that in. I only used saltines (2 Pks) instead of the buttery crackers and I added a splash maybe 2 tablespoons of olive oil to add some fat because I used lowfat cottage cheese and the replaced the buttery crackers. Everything else was the same amounts and it was yummy and made a very tall 13 x 9 pan. Would like to try it with the mushrooms next time for the meatier texture.",

First of all I forgot to pick up the buttery rounds crackers at the store so I just replaced them with more saltines. I also made a double-batch thinking I could freeze some for future meals. I divided the mixture into two baking dishes but still had to bake them for almost triple the time called for in the recipe as it was soupy. After it cooled a little I cut a piece and found it was still not very firm.The taste was not bad but it reminded me more of stuffing than of meatloaf. Maybe because of all the spices? I refrigerated the leftovers and plan to heat it up for dinner tonight. Maybe it will be better the second time around. I think the other reviewers were probably right in adding a little green pepper or something else to jazz it up a little.",
