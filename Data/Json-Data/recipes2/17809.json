I just wanted to let you know the ingredients I use because reviewer \"Annie\" gave me 1 star because she is having troubles getting it right.  I start by buying the best (most expensive) yellow popcorn kernels.  Cheaper brands don't pop well.  I use Pure Wesson Vegetable Oil and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter to cook them in.  Then I top it off with Lawry's Seasoned Salt (remember not to add too much).  I hope that helps Annie.  When you get it to work I hope you come back and update your review.  Thank you and enjoy!",

Only add 3 kernels to the oil first and when all 3 pop then add the rest of the unpopped kernels.  \nMake sure you shake well so that it is in motion.  We also like to add the butter oil that you can get at the grocery store.  Delicious and the paper bag gets rid of the extra oil that usually deposits at the bottom of the bowl.  I REFUSE to eat microwave popcorn again.  Delicious.  Thanks for the post.",

We used to make air-popped popcorn and drizzle on melted butter -- tasty but greasy. Then we switched to microwave popcorn -- easy and quick, but it always has a weird, artificial taste (you know what I'm talking about -- that strange coating it leaves in your mouth).\n\nThen I decided to get back to nature and found this simple recipe. Being raised in the days of Jiffy Pop and progressing to microvwave popcorn, I never knew it was so simple to just make popcorn in an ordinary pot.\n\nThis was so easy --popped up very fast (I just listened to the pops and took it off the stove when popping slowed), very tasty, and virtually no unpopped kernels. If no brown paper bag is handy, no problem. Just put the popcorn in a bowl lined with a paper towel. I'm going to experiment with using smaller amounts of oil and butter to see how lean I can make this without sacrificing taste. \n\nI really like the flavor and texture of this popcorn, and I enjoy serving a fresh snack without the preservatives, artificial flavorings, colorings and chemicals that are found in packaged microwave corn. I'm never going back!  ",
