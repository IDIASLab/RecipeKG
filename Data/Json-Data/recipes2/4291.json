                "reviewBody": "Very easy and tasty. Out of necessity I had to alter a few things. I was running low on whole wheat flour and molasses so I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and 2 cups all-purpose flour and only two tablespoons of molasses. I decided not to add the raisins because I wanted a more savory bread and for this reason I also added 3/4 tsp salt as most soda bread recipes I've used before call for some salt. I'm not sure how much of a difference these changes made. I followed the recipe on everything else including the tartar using reconstituted powdered buttermilk instead of fresh as this is what I keep in my fridge. What I loved about this bread was the texture and the almost nutty flavor that the bran lends it. It bakes into two small brown loaves that are crusty on the outside and just the right density inside. It feels much heartier and healthier than white Irish soda bread. I served it with butter alongside stewed lentils and a mixed green salad. Everyone loved it. It served three people with a little less than half a loaf left over. Highly recommended for when you want a hearty home cooked bread on short notice!",
