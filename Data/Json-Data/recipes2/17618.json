The first time I made this was for Thanksgiving and I followed the recipe as written and everyone loved it! Second time I made this for Christmas and I used Miracle Whip instead of the mayo and it's really great with that also nice change! That added a very slight sweetness and it was \"sharper\" in flavor. I served this with assorted crackers (wheat rye butter sesame & onion). I will definitley use this recipe again for sure!
