I thought the mustard in the dressing was way too prominent when first mixed, but fine after a few hours in the refrigerator. (I frankly can't imagine eating this warm, upon mixng, but that may just be a personal taste.)  I'm getting my appetite back following a stem cell transplant and I need to pack a lot of nutrients into what I do eat. My latest 'craving' is pasta salad, so I've been replacing grains for pasta in old recipes and trying new grain salad recipes. This one is definitely a keeper!",
