Salt your chicken before marinating in the coconut milk. Add a little salt to the breadcrumb mixture. The ginger snaps add a wonderful flavor and this recipe would be lacking without them (since the ginger snaps have a nice spiced and sweet flavor). THe baking method is great, just coat the pan with coconut milk (don't drench the chicken) and it will be perfect. Don't forget the pats of butter ontop of the chicken while cooking:). We loved this N*R recipe...do try!",

Wasnt too coconut-ie just right:) I also used 3 chicken breast since I didnt have tenders and baked at 350 for 1hr (just because thats how I always bake chicken breast) mine was not soggy at all. I only added enough milk to coat the bottom of the pan so idk why everyone is getting soggy bottoms. My husband loved it too! We will have it again:)",
