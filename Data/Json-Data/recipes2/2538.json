Also I ended up using half a bag of powdered sugar. I only added peanuts and M & M's and it's great. Another change I made was used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate simply because thats what I bought. I would recommend this recipe, tastes yummy",

I've made Puppy Chow numerous time and had all of the main ingredients and gave this recipe a go. I found the chocolate peanut butter mixture to be too thick and there wasn't nearly enough powdered sugar. Typically you mix the chow in a paper bag with a lot of powdered sugar to coat the cereal. I highly recommend doing that and increasing the powdered sugar to 1 cups if you are thinking about making this recipe. I still had to pick apart the pieces after shaking it with powdered sugar - again - because the chocolate peanut butter mixture was too thick causing them to stick together in large clumps.",
