When pouring this into the pan I doubted that it would firm up. I was pleasantly surprised when it did firm up! One suggestion for others who want to make this is to sift the powdered sugar before combining ingredients so you don't wonder what kind of nuts were used!!!",

I had to throw the whole mix back in the saucepan because my chocolate chips weren't melting completely by pouring the liquid over all the dry ingredients (next time I think I will try melting the chips in the saucepan with the coconut milk and butter). Measurement-wise I ended up adding more coconut milk to make a creamier texture. I didn't measure just added a little at a time while the mixture was in the saucepan. First time making fudge and my coworkers loved it! Thank you!",

Mix all the dry ingredients together with a fork or a whisk. Put the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave for 1 minute, then stir, then microwave for 10-15 seconds at a time stirring after each go. Once most but not all chips are melted it\u2019s ready to add. This takes about as much time as heating the milk and butter. I add the milk and butter to the dry ingredients then the chocolate and mix well. Yum!",
