Changes I made: Used leftover roast chicken leftover boiled potatoes can of carrots fresh portabello mushrooms (chopped) 1 tablespoon of Italian Seasoning 1 teaspoon of dried oregano 1/2 teaspoon black pepper leftover chicken gravy (instead of cream of chicken soup). Also on top I used crushed Ritz crackers dabbed with butter. Kids and hubby loved it! One suggestion is to cook for 45 minutes at 350 or for 30-40 @ 375 degrees. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
