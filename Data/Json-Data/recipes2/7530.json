I ended up making a smaller circle, cutting out a circle in the middle, and making it like a regular pizza, without having enough dough to fold the edges over to enclose the filling.  If anybody can diagram how to make a ring out of those dough segments, I'd be very interested.  Tasted ok but wasn't what the recipe was meant to be.",
