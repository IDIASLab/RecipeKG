                "reviewBody": "These were a nice change from our \"standard\" mussels recipe! I did make a few minor changes, as it was raining cats and dogs and I didn't feel like going to the store. The bag of mussels that I picked up at Costco was about 4 lbs (WAY more than the 4 cups that the recipe calls for, but it was the right amount of mussels to broth, in my opinion). I used 1/2 of a red bell pepper in place of the red chili pepper, and didn't have any anise flavored liqueur, but I DID have some star anise, so I just added one to the broth while it was simmering (and this worked great). I used \"heavy\" cream, so I skipped the cornstarch all-together.  We all enjoyed these, and I would make them again, but I'd cut the beef broth back (maybe to 1 cup), as it ended up slightly on the salty side.",

I'm not very big on dairy so gave that the axe. I used a vegetable broth instead of beef broth. Squeezed a little fresh lime over the top. And a light sprinkle of spearmint and parsley from the garden. Wonderful recipe.",
