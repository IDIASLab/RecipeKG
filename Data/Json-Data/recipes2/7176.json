I really liked it, but my husband didn't finish his bowl and said \"I'm glad you like it- you have lots of leftovers to eat.\" He said he didn't like the stalks of the bok choy (I left them chopped in large pieces), and said he didn't like the lime taste in it. I however, really liked it- I will chop the stalks smaller like celery next time, and maybe add a cooked chopped chicken breast, and maybe some red pepper flakes. I also will just sprinkle the chopped green onions on top before serving along with the cilantro, as the freshness of the green onion disappeared after it was cooked. I also added fresh cracked black pepper over the top.  I will make this again for myself- only not doubling it next time :). 2nd review- This time I chopped the bok coy stems smaller, added  1 chopped yellow onion, 1 red pepper and 1 green pepper, 1 seeded jalapeno, 4 inner stalks of celery and leaves, chopped,  sauteed in olive oil, and added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, 1 tsp. turmeric powder, skipped the cilantro and put chopped parsley on top. Did not add any lime juice. Delicious!",

I cut the mushrooms medium sized how I like them. Instead of chicken broth, I used vegetable stock since I am vegetarian. I used granulated garlic, ground ginger; ground onion, parsley, and Italian seasoning in the soup. I did not use cilantro. I also added cayenne pepper because I like spice. I added a little pink salt and black pepper as well. As for the lime, I only added a few drops and taste it as it cooked. That way too much wouldn\u2019t be put it and over power the soup because like isn\u2019t a favorite of mine. This way it was adjusted to my tastes and very good.",
