I'm a little leary of the amounts of mustard and mayo though. That seems like an extreme amount so I just eyeballed what I thought would work--probably about a heaping tablespoon of both. I didn't have relish so just used bread and butter pickles. This doesn't really turn out that visually appealing as Godiva Girl noted. I processed everything including the beans in the hopes that would help. I don't think I succeeded though perhaps because I couldn't get it completely smooth. All things considered though it's worth trying even if it looks a bit scary.:o) Thanks for the recipe!",
