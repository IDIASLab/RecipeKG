The cheese mixture was exactly the right amount for the mask, and it firmed up nicely and held its shape. And it tasted really good! Tips: 1) It's tricky to position the olives so they don't get all wonky when you add the cheese filling. Next time, I might add them afterwards. 2) I used the edge of a spoon to emphasize the outline of the lips. I think that made it extra life-like. 3) The next time I make this, I might download a photo of the musculature of the face, and try to copy that with the prosciutto. Because that's how I roll. 4) This isn't just for Halloween; how about a Game of Thrones or Walking Dead viewing party?",

I also shaped the lips with a toothpick once it was flipped out of the mask because they didn't come out too well. I combined the cheese ball part of the recipe with another dip mix. I put the cream cheese green olives and cheddar into my food processor. I then added a packet of Cugino's \"Garlic Schmarlic\" dip mix. So delicious!
