One important tip to make these spur of the moment: I always keep a stock of chickpeas that I've soak, drained, and then frozen (they freeze well in ziplock bags for months). I used these chickpeas and simply thawed them and let them drain out very well before adding them to the food processor. That work perfectly.\r\nI fried mine in a pan. I think, if I'd tested the temp of the oil in the pan or deep fried them they might have been better, but they were very good. I'll do them again!",

                "reviewBody": "Yes!!! An excellent recipe that uses rehydrated dried chickpeas instead of cooked and canned ones. The flavor is better Chef John's way.  The trick is to keep the moisture at a minimum so that you can form the felafel balls and they'll hold their shape. Propper oil temperature is a must. Start at 400F because the temp drops when you add the felafel. I use a long handled slotted spoon to carefully place the felafel in the frying pan. You definitely want to avoid splatter.  To make the sandwiches, I dice cukes, tomato, onion and add these to the felafel.  Plain yogurt with chopped cilantro or a little oregano makes a great topping. Low cal but very filling.",

I also omitted the corriander because I didn't have any. I have done the recipe twice now. Once I let the ingredients sit for 2 hours for them to combine and the second time, I made it straight away. I honestly couldn't note too much difference in taste. Also, I had a heart breaking moment when my falafel balls seem to be falling apart as I was forming them, but this was because I hadn't wet my hands. You MUST wet your hands! Once I did, it was a breeze. I deep fried my balls in vegetable oil in a little 7\" wide sauce pan. Just 2-3 at a time. Served inside of a pita bread with cucumber and mint sauce and it was amazing! Even meat lovers will love this vegetarian dish! Five stars all the way!",
