I added red/green peppers onions and cayenne pepper to the mix and found it much more appealing. Also the avocados are much better if left out of the mix and just served on the side. The avocado flavor gets lost if mixed in the dish. This recipe is a good basic place to start and has great potential with your favorite additions. Would also be good to try with shrimp.",

Other people had commented they had a hard time finding the yellow rice Knorr package too so I didn't bother trying other stores. The Mexican still had yellow rice plus white rice. It had a slight kick to it so my 6 yr old didn't like it. Plus it was very different from the normal meals we eat....Update- made this a second time with Yellow Rice as called for. Used a can of diced tomatoes and should have drained it it was too sweet and runny. My daughter's favorite bites were the ones with avocado so it may be good to add a second one in. Good with black beans too.",
