Easy enough to do and will definitely do it again. I followed instructions exactly buy omitted the cilantro because I did not have any on hand. I did purchase a different pre cooked chicken with seasoning and used a hickory smoked BBQ for one and honey sweet BBQ for the other. Cook time actually needed to be extended to about 25-30 mins for a crispier crust but let me tell ya...it was great!!",
