This recipe is not very fudgy it's creamier (aka messier but worth it) and tastes more like a chocolate cheesecake after a few changes I made. I have made this twice and love it... but I agree with others it was quite bitter the first time. Adjustments I made are: I cut the butter to 1/2 cup cream to 1 tbsp cocoa to 5 tbsp. Added an extra tablespoon of sweetener (I used Whole Earth which is a blend of erythritol stevia and monk fruit). I did not use walnuts (personal taste) and in place of raspberry extract (didn't have any) I substituted orange extract the first time and vanilla the second(in addition to the vanilla it already calls for). Both were good. I also had to heat it a little longer than 30 seconds in the microwave and used a square pan instead of the 3x9 cake pan.",

This comes together quickly and satisfies the sweet craving for those following a keto or low-carb lifestyle. I used Swerve sweetener. This doesn't have a firm fudge texture but rather its softer like a block of cream cheese making it a little messy to eat. This makes large servings. You could definitely cut it into 24 pieces and be satisfied because of the richness. Next time I'll try using coconut extract.",
