Substitute 1/4 C of chopped green ONION for the green olive. I blended the cream cheese sour cream and shredded cheese in a food processor first. Then stirred in the other ingredients by hand. Spread in a shallow dish. Garnished with a sprinkle of paprika and a tiny mound of chopped black olives in the middle.",
