You can add up to two more eggs to stretch this recipe out - the filling will rise about an inch over the crust but won't spill before before it firms up. I added 1 tablespoon of sour cream for each egg and this was wonderfully moist. Last I used a sun-dried-tomato and basil flavored mozarella and thought it really added something. Thanks!",
