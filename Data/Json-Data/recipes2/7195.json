Don't skip the Parmesan-Romano cheese, it cuts the acidity of the Worcestershire sauce and garlic and makes for a wonderful flavor blend. My boyfriend heartily approves! This recipe would also be a good vegetable base for a quiche.",

This was very colorful, flavor not so great.\" So other than zoodling my zucchini and using red onion for additional color, I didn't make any changes. We weren't terribly fond of it, and the only culprit we came up w/ was the Worcestershire sauce, which we seem to think didn't jive well w/ the freshness of the veggies and herbs, and that a splash of balsamic or red wine vinegar and a good olive oil would've been much better. Even as the leftovers marinated in the fridge, the flavor didn't improve. I will say that it was pretty, and as the recipe author mentions in the notes, there are countless ways to customized it w/ diff. veggies. I just think the lube part of it needs to change.",
