I softened the cream cheese to the extent that I just mixed all of the ingredients in a bowl, by hand, and it did fine. I don't have a lot of patience anyway to cut 16 oz of cream cheese into little pats. I also mixed the shredded cheese in but won't do this next time as it needs that color for a topping. One son wouldn't touch this because of its' \"gastric\" appearance. He missed out! I served this as a small meal in between a late Sunday breakfast and dinner. Be warned - this makes a TON! It really filled the entire 9 x 13 pan! This is very filling and rich and is to be served with sturdy chips.",

It's easiest to cut if you put it in the freezer for 15 minutes and then cut with a cheese slicer. This dip does requires a sturdy chip.
