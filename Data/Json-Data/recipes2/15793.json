I would reccomend really whisking the dry mix before adding any wet ingredients. They're also REALLY sticky so its a pain to get them onto cookie sheets. Once you bake them its near impossible to tell if theyre done because they look fine on the top but burn quickly on the bottom if you wait too long. Stick with the 9 minute mark. Otherwise theyre great!!!",
