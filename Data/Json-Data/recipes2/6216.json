First why put butter in with sausage - it's already loaded with fat - and you're throwing it away when you drain. I saved the butter until the mushrooms were added. I suspect it can be omitted entirely. Second I think the pound of cheese is waaaaay too much. The recipe says put a pinch on each tart - no way that uses a pound. I mixed 1/3 to 1/2 pound in with the suasage and mushrooms after they cooled and that was very generous. There was so much cheese in the mix that a pinch on top was no longer necessary. In all fairness I used grated instead of shredded cheese but a pound is a pound. I also took the advice of others and pre-baked the tart shells for 5 minutes. I will definitely make this again with my slight modifications. Thank you for submitting this great appetizer.",
