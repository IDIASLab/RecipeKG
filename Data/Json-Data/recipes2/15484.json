One trick that we use is not to use any milk, or eggs or anything before putting it in the flour batter. Soak them in water for a while before you put them in the flour batter and coat them. Then make sure you let them sit in the flour batter for at least 15-20 mins and don't shake the flour off. Toss them into your deep fryer for about 11 mins depending on size. We have HUGE jo jos. They will turn out crunchy and amazing and no milk or eggs required!! :)",

I microwaved the wedges for 1 minute, then added all the seasonings, and then baked them in the oven on 450 degrees for about 20 min. on a greased cookie sheet with melted butter drizzled on top.  They came out perfectly crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.

They WERE tasty BUT after doing the first \"batch\" - the flour mix became chunky - which in turn was chunky on the 2nd batch of wedges. Plus they were a mess to make. The spice mix is VERY good (on the ones that turned out) but as the recipe is written I'm not sure if they were worth the hassle. Perhaps trying to coat them by placing the spice mix/potatoes in a plastic baggie might work better and be less messy? I'll think about it...",

My first batch looked delicious and had some flavor but after that batch they went down hill. I do agree with other past reviews that the seasoning mix should be doubled and the mixture wasn't enough for the 2 potatoes I used. Overall I get the taste these were supposed to achieve but there has to be another way of getting the batter to stick without chunky results? I used the plastic bag method but seem to think it has more to do with the batter not the method of coating. Maybe next time use milk instead of egg? I may try that next time. Thanks Wendy. I will be playing around with this recipe.",

For the egg mixture I mixed 2 eggs and 1 cup heavy cream.  To cut down on the mess I put the potatoes in the egg mixture and then a couple at a time I would use a fork to transfer them to the flour mixture and then I would shake the bowl side to side until the wedges were coated.
