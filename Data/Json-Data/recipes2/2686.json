I had a small gathering and made 2, 2 1/2 pound pork  roasts. No leftovers, it was that good!  I used Kingsford hickory briquettes on my Weber grill and cooked it low and slow. There was a beautiful smoke ring on the roast and I couldn't believe that I made such a wonderful meal. The food was gone so fast, I didn't get a picture, sorry.  I'll get one next time,  this is definitely my go to pork roast recipe!",
