I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using a couple teaspoons of dried basil, because I didn't have any fresh, and I added 1 Tablesppon of parmesan to the mixture. Be sure to top the bread right before serving because it will get a bit soggy if sitting for awhile. I may toast both sides of the bread next time. I'll be using this recipe often, I couldn't stop eating this. During the summer I plan to roast my own pepeprs, using a blend of yellow, orange and red. This would look beautiful on a platter for summer picnics and barbeques. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! :)",
