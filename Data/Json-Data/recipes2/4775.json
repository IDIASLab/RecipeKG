I made it exactly as recipe called for, but using the Kraft powdered parmesan cheese as I did not have fresh grated on hand. ( I used perhaps 1/4 cup of this as it just seemed all I would need ).   I also did not have garlic salt so I used 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of sea salt.  I will make this again but next time, I want to try it with melted butter drizzled around and the powdered mix sprinkled on separately as this is my traditional method and I would like to compare.  I look forward to trying different flavours now.",
