They are very easy to make and for a party you can mix the butter parmesan and prosciutto ahead and refrigerate it until your guests arrive then microwave the mixture for 30 seconds to soften and spread on crostinis and pop under the broiler for a few minutes to heat. This worked great as they can be made in batches and served warm. I don't like tomato bruschetta so this was a welcome alternative. As my dad said you can't eat just one!",
