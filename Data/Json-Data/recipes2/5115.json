I'd recommend adding salt and pepper to the asparagus along with the garlic powder and olive oil. I did like that this really didn't need a dressing and was tossed around in the bowl used for the asparagus. I also recommend only 15 mins on the asparagus but that is personal preference. Once everything was tossed together I did add a light drizzle of oil and some additional salt and pepper to taste. Delicious!",
