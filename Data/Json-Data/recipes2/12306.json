Something you will feel very good about putting out for guests whether family or friends or \"newly mets.\"  I made it, except for measurements of ingredients, as written.  I haven't used Frozen Puff Pastry often and wasn't sure whether or not it could be rolled out thinner.\nThe recipe called for cutting out a 12\" circle from each of the two pastry sheets, but my pastry could only accommodate a 9\" circle (per sheet) at best. So I scaled back the amount of ricotta and pesto accordingly.   I baked as instructed, until browned, but think that in future I will heat the tray in the oven before placing the pastry (on parchment paper) on it.  To firm up the bottom.  It was a bit doughy.  But still delicious.  I'm thinking that this technique can also be used with other fillings! My thanks to Magda!",
