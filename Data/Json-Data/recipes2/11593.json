        "description": "Clotted cream, also called Devon or Devonshire cream, is a staple at Devon tea services. Serve it with scones, sponge cake, or rolls. This recipe has been in the family for five generations. The cooking time and preparation time vary depending on your stove, the temperature, and even the season. It's a lengthy process, but the end result is well worth it! The clotted cream may be served in two ways: you can serve just the top part of the cream by skimming the thick top layer off. Alternately, mix the top layer into the cream completely, beating it briefly and gently. Any leftover cream can be kept refrigerated for up to four days. Serve with scones, sponge cake, or rolls.",
