I made these for a Valentine themed dinner so instead of a muffin tin I used a heart shaped cookie cutter and baked them on a sheet. Because I was determined to make heart shaped pancakes I had to add some panko bread crumbs to the mixture to get it firm enough to use a cookie cutter. Not necessary at all but it was for what I was wanting to do. These were good but I do think the hot sauce needs doubled (tripled if you add bread crumb ) if you want a good kick to them.",
