I didn't have potato flakes, so I omitted that ingredient.  I cut my chicken breasts into pretty narrow strips so they only needed about 5 minutes on each side in the cast iron skillet, which was filled 1/4 way with Vegetable Oil.  The Oil should be at about 350 degrees, it is important to fry in a good hot oil but not to the point of smoking.  I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper, a little cayenne and garlic powder.  After dipping the strips in the flour, then in the egg and then in the crushed saltines, I noticed some bare spots on the chicken so I sprinkled bread crumbs over the top which filled in the gaps.  After frying they were SO moist on the inside, and CRUNCHY on the outside.  This was a great recipe, and its a keeper, thanks for posting it!",

I did make some changes: I did not have dry potato flakes, so I crushed some plain potato chips instead and used about 2 tablespoons of that. I also found that one egg was not enough, but you could probably go with 1/4 cup of flour as I had plenty of that left. Finally 1/4 cup of vegetable oil was not near enough; maybe if you were using a very small pan, but for my large pan I used a cup or more (you want the chicken about half submerged in the oil). Not a health-conscious meal, but it is delicious and pretty easy to make. I will make this again.",

One thing I learned from my cooking experience is when I'm coating I put a little milk in the beaten egg mixture, along with 1/2 tsp of baking powder.and in the cracker mixture I added thyme, paprika, and a touch of granulated garlic . I first coat the meat in flour, then egg mixture , then flour, then egg , and with this recipe I did the cracker mixture once at the end right before I drop in the pan. For me the double even triple dipping process keeps the coating nice, thick, and keeps it on the meat. Very good recipe though thank you.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe exceeded my expectations. Thanks to those who clarified what temperature to cook the chicken. As written the recipe makes delicious and crispy chicken strips.\n\nI never have saltines so I use a sleeve of Ritz crackers instead. For seasoned salt I used Lowry's. In subsequent preparations, per the recommendations of other reviewers, I added a dash of garlic powder as well and dredged in flour and egg twice before coating in crackers. I used two eggs in order to do so, but did not need to increase the flour. I left the crackers in the resealable bag and added the other ingredients to the bag, then added the chicken pieces and shook to coat. Much easier and cleaner.\n\nI think the 15-20 min cooking time indicates how long it takes to cook all the chicken, not per piece. It only took me 6ish minutes per batch of strips to cook through using about 1/2 cup peanut oil in my cast iron skillet. The coating was perfectly crisp and didn't get greasy or soggy like a batter-fried or oven-baked strip.\n\nIf needed, here are some substitutions for the potato flakes: crushed corn flakes, crushed rice crispies, seasoned bread crumbs, corn meal, or a second kind of crushed cracker.\n\nI served the chicken with a honey mustard, sweet and sour, and garlic lemon dipping sauces left over from a fondue dinner.",
