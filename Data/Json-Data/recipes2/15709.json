I made this for my husband, and so did my sister for her husband (he calls it cat food).  Anyway, it always gets eaten, so call it what you want!  To those of you who add pasta, it just isn't the same, you really just need to try it in the original form, it really isn't a noodle dish. Thanks for posting this wonderful old family favorite.",
