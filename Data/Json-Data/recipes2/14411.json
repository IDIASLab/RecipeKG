The sauce reminds me of the Sicilian sauce at Valentino's, a popular midwest restaurant, which originated in Lincoln, Nebraska.  I used freshly grated Parmesan, which is the only way to go.  This was an excellent way to use some of the leftover Honeysliced ham from the holidays.  Don't let the idea of ham in pasta sauce scare you away.  It's far better than you might think.  Do note:  As at least one other reviewer has suggested, you only need 3/4 of the pasta in a one pound package.  There isn't enough sauce for the full pound of pasta.  The pasta really soaks up the sauce.",

I would guess about three tablespoons of onion and one heaping teaspoon of garlic. The ham onion and garlic together reached the two cup line in my measuring cup before I heated them all together. I also only used 3/4 of the box of fettucine. The sauce could have handled the whole box perhaps but I thought it was just right this way. I would have tried either adding peas or mushrooms but my picky 11 year old would have certainly turned up her nose at it then. After eating it I think the mushrooms would be the way to go although the recipe is great without them. Thank you for a terrific recipe that I will be making again. My fussy daughter even loved it and that is saying alot! She hates to try new things.",
