While the recipe doesn't use a ton, truffle oil is quite expensive. I'm not sure this recipe is worth the effort or expense, particularly for a someone who eats meat. It still gets 3 stars, because it doesn't taste all that bad.  It's close to real pate, but different enough to feel like something is missing.  *** Three years later*** This recipe has really grown on me. My vegetarian friends seem to like it quite a bit. I keep the ingredients on hand and it's fairly quick and easy to make when I want to bring a dish to a party. I have found that if you don't tell people it's lentils, word might get around that it's liver and it won't eat eaten - even by the nonvegetarians",

I tried to play with the ingredients and mixed in a bit of brandy and I think that made it more of a mock pat\u00e8 than a snazzy lentil dip-which is what it tastes like with its original ingredients. I put it in the freezer to maintain the shape of pat\u00e8 and for the next time will make some aspic to cover it to help hold the shape. The original recipe is a 4 star recipe for me; add a splash of brandy and you can tack on a half star. Thank you Cathi from NJ for an enjoyable treat.",
