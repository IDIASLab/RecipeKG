I added cayenne and curry powder and it gave it a great international flavor. I also added red yellow and orange red bell peppers when it came time for the veggies. The timings on this recipe were also spot on. 6 mins for chicken was perfect and juicy and my vegetables were not soggy at all. I used fresh zucchini not pre packaged. Would def make again!",
