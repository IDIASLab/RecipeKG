We prepared it just as written, and it was fantastic - I was leary of the anchovies but they deepened the flavor without overpowering the scallops at all. The one issue we had with the recipe is that if prepared as written, the scallops are not necessarily seared on both sides because the water from the peppers prevents the browning of the second side. Next time we might try searing both sides before adding the peppers, maybe even removing the scallops once cooked and then adding the pepper mixture, then mixing it all together at the end.",
