The flavors meld beautifully.I made half the recipe exactly as it was called for and the other half I left out the olives substituted celery seed for celery salt garlic powder for garlic salt and added a teaspoon of white wine for my friends with salt restricted diets. They loved it and I loved both the original version and the lower salt one.PS- I used Dijon mustard for the prepared mustard. Both versions will delight your tastebuds. Many Thanks Jennifer. This won't be reserved just for holidays at my house! This is definately going on my New Years Eve Buffet this year! I'll probably use it to fill my mini cream puffs or puff pastries.",

EVERYBODY rated this a 5 and most of them said they would give it a 10 if they could. We tried it on crackers all kinds of veggies (Beleive me they weren't picky!) and when I had ran out of all the veggies they were scooping it out by the spoonfuls and eating it right out of their spoon. It wasn't strictly all men either. By the time the evening had ended everybody had asked me why I hadn't made a double batch. I didn't change a thing when I made this recipe and I won't in the future either!",

This is a delicious spread and perfect for celery boats as another reviewer noted. My family was surprised by the spicy kick but heartily came back for more and more! We had it on crackers and on celery and gobbled up a whole bowl (I made half the recipe and it made a large bowlful). I recommend this spread for those who like their hors d'oeuvres rather spicy.",
