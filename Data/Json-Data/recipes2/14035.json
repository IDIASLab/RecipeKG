I don't think it serves \"24 people\". A party of 6 gobbled it up real quick. Will definitely make again:)",

It was one wet mess the next morning. The cake was also sickly sweet some people may like that but no one in my family did. I liked how the marshmallows on the bottom of the pan floated to the top to create a crust. It's inspired me to try a rocky road cake using a store bought chocolate cake mix.",

Then I arranged sliced fresh strawberries on top of that and poured strawberry gelatin powder on it. After 30 minutes in 350 oven however the cake was still liquid at the center. So I baked it longer checking every 5 minutes. The cake was done after about 45 minutes of total baking time. The marshmallow crust was browned but thankfully not burned and it tasted fine. The cake was delicious! It was also easy and fun to make. Note: next time I will try using just 3 oz of gelatin powder instead of 6 oz.",

I didn't but here's how I made the cake - it's kind of funny. I didn't have frozen strawberries but instead used a combo bag of raspberries blueberries and strawberries. I only had raspberry jello and yellow cake instead of white box cake. I didn't have mini marshmallows but cut-up larger ones to cover the bottom of the pan. The cake was delicious! How do those marshmallows get to the top of the cake? Don't be afraid to make this one with a few changes. Experiment a little you may just discover something amazing. I will definately be making this one again. Maybe next time I will try using the ingredients listed in the recipe.",
