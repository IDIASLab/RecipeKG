I was wary of trying it cause I always go for the ultra highly rated and tested recipes from this site (its just meal security) but I went out on a limb for this one and was sensationally pleased. Trust me. I know what Im talking about. You HAVE to make this soup. Update: I just wanted to say that I use the great big can of broth or even the box rather than the 14oz can the recipe calls for. Also I use a turkey kielbasa or turkey smoked sausage in a package (by the bacon)rather than buying a pound fresh sausage in the meat section. I slice it thin and prefer it in taste. I make this soup at least every other week as my family just LOVES it and it is so quick and easy!!!",

Chopped up the onion and garlic in my food processor threw it all in with the tomatoes etc. and let it simmer for an hour and a half. It was simply amazing! NO salt needed the sausage and tomatoes give it plenty. Easy healthy freezes well....what more could you want?? THANKS for a great recipe!",

This was one of the soups we presented during our annual soup extravaganza and it received many kudos. We have made it several times and will continue to make it.",
