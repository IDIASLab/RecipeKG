I cooked the onion garlic and red pepper flakes like in the recipe. I added crushed tomatoes and lots of spices and Italian seasoning. I added the Kale and used penne pasta. This came out delicious! This is a great recipe to reference even if you don't have all the ingredients. And guess what puttanesca mean??",

I also rinsed the capers and the tuna to cut the sodium, but ended up adding a little salt at the end, probably because I used more kale and fish than the recipe called for.

I made this last night and it is definitely making it on the rotation! As written the salty items may have been overpowering... I used just less than half the anchovies and capers called for and about 2 Tbsp of chopped kalamata olives. Like many other reviewers I increased the kale - about 7 Cups - and sauteed it first in the onion/garlic/anchovies/capers before adding the tomatoes and a splash of dry white wine. I also used a half cup or so of the cooking water when adding the pasta to create a bit more \"sauce\". I used a protein-added whole grain pasta to truly make this a one-dish meal.

Also I couldn't even taste the red pepper flakes although it was an entire teaspoon? The olives in Puttanesca are really important in my opinion to the flavor. So... don't forget them. I used regular penne because it's what I had on hand. The sauce was a little salty but after being mixed with the pasta it was fine. I did rinse the capers. I also added dried basil oregano freshly grated nutmeg (for the kale) and freshly ground fennel seed. I also used more kale. The kale is awesome. I grew it in a box outside. Thanks for the recipe.
