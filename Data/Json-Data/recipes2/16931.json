I used dried oregano (1/4 tsp. crushed) and, as others, baked for 12 mins. then, topped with chunks of a Greek Feta marinated in olive oil with oregano and basil. Second time, I prep'd about 3 times the recipe and, next day, served the remaining few topped with add'l Feta and popped under broiler for 2 mins.  Next time, plan to toss the hot tomatoes with fresh spinach leaves and slivers of carmelized garlic.\nA versatile recipe - thank you for submitting it.      ",
