After making them once I decided to try to make them less 'wings' and more 'nuggets' so I could put them on top of a pasta dish I was making and they turned out great! I didn't achieve quite an even coating all around the nuggets - if I were to do it again I would lay down a thing coating of the breading on a baking pan place the nuggets on that and then sprinkle the rest of the mix on top to try for a better coating. But they were delicious crunchy and soft!",
