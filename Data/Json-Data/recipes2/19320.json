It's also very good on French bread for a spicy garlic bread alternative.",

I cut the jalapenos in half when I made it but I am going full strength this time. We thought it could handle the extra heat. I used the salmon \"filet mignon\" cut that is very easy to grill. Served it with grilled veggies and the Japanese rice from this site. Used the left over sauce on the rice! To die for. Tonight I am going to put the salmon on some romaine lettuce with a loaf of french bread. Perfect for a summer night!",

I didn't flip it on the grill which allowed the sauce to crisp up nicely on one side which made it look great. Sauce is a much better word than marinade for this recipe. Push it with the spatula and when the fish separates from the skin it's done. You can test it that way without breaking the crust and damaging presentation. The mayo makes the peppers chill out a bit more than we expected. My wife and I like a kick to our food so next time I'll switch all the peppers for Habaneros and add a lemon. We made the entire sauce but only two fillets. I'm gonna use it to bread and bake chicken.",
