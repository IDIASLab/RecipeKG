However, the first taste was a mini-assault of garlic and salt.  The salt isn\u2019t necessary at all, and half the amount of garlic powder would be a big improvement. (I could taste it hours later)   I found using a 1/4 cup measure was exactly the amount needed to evenly produce eight biscuits, however, these eight biscuits were unnecessarily large.  If I were to make these again I would make them a little smaller, perhaps for a total of one dozen, more reasonably sized biscuits.  Also, watch the baking time closely!  I pulled mine from the oven at 15 minutes \u2013 any longer and they would have looked like a baking mishap!  Addendum:  For what it's worth, Hubs disagrees with me on the garlic powder and salt, believing both are fine just as is.",
