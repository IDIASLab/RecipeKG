Though I did saute the cabbage in the skillet for 15 minutes or so. Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt didn't have that. My egg roll wrapper package had 15 wrappers so we made them kind of small to use all the wrappers. I really would have liked to have them a bit on the large side though. That way their not too 'doughy' tasting if you know what I mean. Have the white of one egg in a bowl handy to seal the ends of your egg rolls towards the end of rolling the up....just use a small brush. A NEW paint brush works great (the small ones). I deep fried the egg rolls at 350 degrees for 3 minutes PER SIDE. Any longer and they'd be burned.",
