It would have been just perfect for a quick dessert with a couple of Christmas cookies! This was wonderful. I'm fairly experienced with making ice cream so in looking over the recipe I knew it would need to be tinkered with a little. First for my liking anyway there's too high a ratio of milk and eggnog to cream which I knew could make this a little icy or grainy - in any event not as smooth and silky as I prefer - so I used a ratio of half eggnog and half heavy cream. I also like a rich custard-style ice cream so I added a couple of eggs. Finally no extra sugar was used other than what was in the eggnog nor was there any vanilla. I knew it would turn out kind of flat so I added some of each. So...scaling this down to 6 servings to fit my ice cream maker I used 1-1/2 cups eggnog 1-1/2 cups heavy cream and 1 tsp. vanilla which I whisked into 2 eggs beaten with 1/3 cup sugar for 1-2 minutes. As written this really is only a 3-star recipe for the reasons I outlined but I don't want to discourage anyone from trying it because with just a little tweaking this was a delightful rich frozen eggnog custard!",
