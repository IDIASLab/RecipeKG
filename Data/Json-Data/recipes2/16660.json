One they were slightly dry and the onions made it harder to bind the ingredients together when trying to press into ball shapes I think mincing the onions instead of dicing them would be better. Other then that it was a neat use of ingredients. Will make again. But will note mine didn't fry very long because they got really dark rather quickly.",
