One cited too much soy sauce while the other cited too much Worcestershire sauce. It's simple enough to test. Just mix equal parts of soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce say 1Tsp each and a dash of garlic powder (not garlic salt). That's the flavor it will impart to the meat. But this marinade is for taste only. It will not tenderize as there is no real acidity in it. To tenderize you need to add wine vinegar or both or maybe citric acid such as lime or lemon. True it will change the taste a bit but more complexity just might benefit this recipe. Thanks Renee Manz.",
