I first baked just the fish sticks at the temp on the box for about half the time the box calls for. This allows them to crisp up a bit before adding the soup. Then I poured over the soup mixture. We used cream of mushroom and Nature's Seasons instead just because of taste preference. Then on top of the soup I put tator tots instead of french fries. Then some shredded cheddar on top of that. Baked the whole thing at 400 for 25 minutes. Came out really good and the tator tots stayed crisp being on top. The whole thing is still a casserole consistency but not overly soupy at all the way I made it.",

The sauce the cream of celery milk mayo and curry made on the top of the fish sticks and french fries might be better if used as a dipping sauce for the fish sticks instead of they way the recipe calls for.
