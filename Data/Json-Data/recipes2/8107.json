The seasoning was delicious the roast stayed tender and like other reviews I read for a Med-rare to Medium roast only 45 minutes of baking time was required. (Could have been less had I used the convection setting.). The use of the two pieces of foil made transferring the drippings into a pan for the sauce simple and the sauce itself was delicious.
