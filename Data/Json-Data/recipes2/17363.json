I collected genuine spring water from one of the many live local springs in Manitou Springs CO. The juice was easy to make but frankly I was a bit disappointed. The juice was pretty weak-tasting. It was okay but nothing special so I'll give it a 3-star rating. I only had some of it and gave the rest to The Woman I Love. She on the other hand loved the juice and would give it a 5-star rating herself.",
