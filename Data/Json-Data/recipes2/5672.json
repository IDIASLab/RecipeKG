I cooked for the time and temp mentioned. and at that stage checked and they werent fully dry yet. i took half out of the oven at the time the recipe suggests and let them cool. The other half i returned to oven shut it off and let them dry up further till the oven was cool (2 hours). Those ones dried alot more..and were crisp. the ones i ate once cool were chewy and not chip like. I also had a hard time getting over the colour that they turned once in the oven..they ended up being mostly grey/blackish. i used a very firm banana as well. i would suggest cooking them for longer..or allowing them to dry out completely in the oven till the oven has cooled down. Also brush some lemon juice on the slices so they stay that nice yellow color.",

This is a delicious way to use your overripe (brown/spotted, but still slice-able) bananas and turn them into candy for the kids - or the adults.\nI think the key to this recipe is to get air circulating below the slices as they bake. \nI used a  non-stick cooling rack placed on top of a cookie sheet/pan.  I did not use any oil or lemon juice.  I simply sliced them about 1/8\" and placed the slices on the wire rack, then baked them between 170-210 degrees for about an hour and a half to dry them out.  I turned the oven off, but let them stay in there until the oven was fully cool.  They turned out chewy and delicious.  I definitely will make this again whenever I have overripe bananas but want a healthy treat in lieu of bread or muffins. \nI can see how these would be great used as an ingredient in homemade granola bars, too.",
