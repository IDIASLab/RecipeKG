The video suggests using 4 cloves of garlic, pressed (missing from the ingredient list). SIn the video John stresses the importance of having 2 cups of liquid. After simmering it for so long, I measured the stock and found I was a full cup shy! I added an extra cup of boiling water to make sure the couscous would be fully cooked.",
