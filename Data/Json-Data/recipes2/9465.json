                "reviewBody": "This turned out pretty good. I had issues getting the oysters to stay with the shrimp. I wasn't confident that they were going to stay on the skewer once they hit the grill. At 2 a piece I couldn't risk them ending up at the bottom of the grill so I decided to wrap them with the bacon and skewer the shrimp on separately. Because the shrimp were by themselves I gave them a sprinkle of seasoning and I'm glad I did. The oysters could have used some seasoning too. Overall good recipe but I highly recommend giving all of the seafood a dash of your favorite seasoning (Old Bay was my choice) prior to skewering. The bacon was good but it didn't flavor it enough in my opinion.",
