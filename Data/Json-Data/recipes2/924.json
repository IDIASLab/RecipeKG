It is a really thin cut (1/4 inch thick) of boneless rib eye, taken from the small end of the rib roast, you can pan fry it, but I suggest grilling it. I think it is best when taken straight off the grill, sliced and served with a warm tortilla.",

The steak by itself is amazing, but we kicked it up a notch by adding a Creole mojo on top. The recipe for the mojo is as follows: 1. Mash 6 cloves of garlic (we used the whole ones you can get in a plastic jar) and place them in a bowl. 2. Add equivalent to a whole onion (sliced) into the bowl as well - an added secret is to use the onions from the marinade you made for the steaks instead of tossing them out! 3. Add the juice of two limes to the bowl. 4. Heat up two cups of pork-grease or canola oil in a saucepan on high. The key is to COOK IT ON HIGH UNTIL IT BEGINS TO SMOKE! As soon as the oil/grease begins to smoke, remove it from heat and pour it into the bowl you prepared with the garlic, onions, and lime juice! The heat from the hot oil will cook everything and make an awesome topping for the steak! Be careful because it will pop and sizzle when you add it! 5. Let the mixture sit until it cools a little (give it time to cook the onions and garlic).",
