The second time I made it I tossed the shredded zucchini and cucumbers in a salad spinner and spun out some of the moisture - made a huge difference! This recipe is easily adapted to any taste. I've substituted italian dressing mix for the ranch dressing mix. This is delicious with ripe tomatoes and the addition of leftover cubed ham smoked turkey grilled shrimp grilled salmon or mahi mahi. I use fat-free miracle whip in lieu of mayo and set the \"additions\" up buffet-style on the counter. Everyone can add whatever they like. This is a great summertime lunch or light dinner. Thanks Vickie!",

When I made this tonight I added in a heavy 1/4 c of shredded red onion. It needs to get cold it says serve immediately.. and you could.. but its better after it has a chance to meld together. My husband asked if this was the cucumber coleslaw like last time and I think that describes it perfect. A shredded carrot or 2 would also be good. I like that this is easily changeable to what comes out of my garden and crisper.",
