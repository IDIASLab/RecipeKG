I remove the oatmeal flour, then blend the wet ingredients and add the oatmeal back in a little at a time so it doesn't stick in blobs around the edges.",

I put the oats into the blender first, which made it hard to mix, so I would put the oats in last. The waffles didn't stick in my cast iron waffle maker like other reviewers said, but they also didn't rise much. next time I'd add some baking powder to give them a little more fluff. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe to tweak. \n\nThe following million times I have made this have been much different. \n\nFirst, I blend two cups of oats in my food processor so that it becomes flour-like. I then pour that into a bowl for a minute while I mix everything else into the food processor. I use: 4 whole eggs, Teaspoon each of baking soda and powder, Whole tub of store brand fat free pineapple cottage cheese, Splash vanilla, Pinch cinnamon, 2 TBS turmeric , 3-4 scoops FurtherFood collagen peptides, 2-3 TBS chia seeds \n\nI blend all of that together and then add the oat-flour back in and mix again. \n\nThis makes 10 waffles- enough for my boyfriend and I each to have one until I make them again. I usually eat mine with peanut butter and a sliced banana on top; sometimes drizzled with maple syrup. \n\nThank you for this recipe- sorry I hacked it all up! STILL GREAT!",
