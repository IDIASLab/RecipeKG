Personally, I enjoy jarred alfredo, especially Ragu! You were quite rude and brash, especially for never trying the recipe.\r\n\r\nPersonally I poached my fillet with a bit of garlic and red wine. I use rotini because that's what was on sale (yup, that's right, on a super strict budget and can only afford the noodles on sale!! oh wow, why do I have salmon? because I live in Alaska!) ... so jarred alfredo, on sale noodles, and bay caught salmon ... this recipe was pretty divine!",

We ended up making too much salmon for the original dish and ended up just buying more alfredo sauce and cooking up more rotini to eat it again the next night. Super easy and it took about 20 minutes total to make - I just timed the cooking time of the salmon with the cooking time of the pasta. Thank you for sharing this recipe - will be added to my permanant recipe book at home!",
