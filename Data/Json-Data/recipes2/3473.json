I did not have the fresh basil and so used dried (about 1/8 of a cup) used chili powder as I did not have red pepper flakes on hand added 1 clove of garlic as suggested and used a whole red pepper. I blended all the ingredients together and added small amounts of olive oil till it was to the consistency i wanted. Severed over chicken and pasta. It was well recieved by my husband and young boys. Will make it again this summer when I have fresh basil. This is a good pesto recipie for those who can't have nuts.",

I then blended it altogether until smooth. Delicious. This would be great as a condiment for sandwiches (chicken or turkey perhaps and definitely on grilled portobella mushroom sandwiches). Also good served over baked potatoes. Very easy to make. If you like it hotter add more of the hot red pepper flakes or some hot sauce. As is it was perfect for my tastes. Would also be good with a little onion added to it or if you like garlic a bit of garlic. You don't want to lose the pepper taste however. The freshness of the vegetable really shines through in this recipe.",
