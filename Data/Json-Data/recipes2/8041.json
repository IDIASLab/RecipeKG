Certainly is quick to prepare, and if piped into a dish or a small glass, actually has good presentation (nice enough for a company dessert).   I just sprinkled on a few chocolate chips rather than mixing in, and the consistency is incredibly smooth and peanut-y.  Next time, I'm going to add more vanilla Greek yogurt which I think will lighten the mousse texture even more.   I can see mixing in some chopped banana or even some crisp pieces of bacon.  Sarah, thanks for sharing your recipe.   \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022UPDATE 12.25.17\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022  FYI, I made this yesterday substituting Nutella for the peanut butter which was a nice variation on this simple dessert.",

I used natural peanut butter, and at 10 seconds in the microwave, it didn't seem liquid as indicated in the recipe, so I put in for another 10 seconds. That was a mistake, because the peanut butter started to cook--it got thick and grainy. I was still able to incorporate all of it into the yogurt, but it took quite a bit of stirring. Next time, I don't think I need to microwave at all. Also, I think I will try honey to sweeten instead.",
