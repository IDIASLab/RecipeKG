                "reviewBody": "I AM THE OP. I made these recently and have some notes for you all. (1) The recipe was changed from original for some reason when posted here by AR. You only need one large skillet. Use half the butter, cook half the caps, removing those that are done, adding more butter and cooking the rest. Do not overcook or they become mushy. Keep them somewhat firm. (2) Neufchatel is a type of cream cheese with a milder flavor and sold right next to the regular c.c. in the store. (3) To make a thicker filling, add a tbsp. or two of plain breadcrumbs, not egg white. (4) Do not overlook the step of adding the finely chopped raw stems to the filling! This gives it more body and a bit of texture, and helps to thicken it up a little. (5) I used a cookie press and a very large star-type tip to fill the caps. Much faster, easier, and nicer looking. (6) I tried something new--After cooking and draining all the 'shrooms (\"cup\" down in the colander, by the way) I put the drained juice back into the hot pan along with whatever juices were still in the pan from cooking. I lowered the heat and simmered and reduced it until dark and slightly thick, about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. I added 2 tbsp. of butter and the garlic and continued with the recipe. It made them very savory with a concentrated mushroom flavor. Try it both ways and see which you like better! Enjoy!",
