For those of you who change it until it's unrecognizable, and then review it, shame on you.  Prepare it the way it's written, and if you want to change it drastically ---- publish your own recipe, don't review this one.",

I just thought how greek does that sound? But I made it exactly per the recipe and am so glad I did. seriously this is good. Thank you!",

We had Cat Cora's Pastitsio at her place in Disney World but the recipes I had found were all for too large a number of servings for my family. This looked interesting and I had most ingredients on hand so we gave it a try. Turned out very good. Changes I made due to my pantry were: I used a shredded combo of mozzarella and parmesian for the cheese canned diced tomatoes chicken broth instead of stock and I was careful with the spices. I did not use chili powder- just salt and black pepper- and I started with half the amounts of allspice and cinnamon. Basically spiced to taste until I got it where I liked it.
