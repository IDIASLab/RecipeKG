I used a no yeast crust recipe from this sight and because the crust needed to also cook, I ended up baking it for about 25 to 30 minutes (until the crust was nice and crispy).  \nThere is one thing that makes this recipe a five star, and that is the addition of the onions.  Unlike others, I sliced one onion into super thin strips and browned until golden separately from the beef, then topped the onions onto the ground beef before ending with lots of cheese.  It would be way too boring without the onions and the only thing I would do differently next time (agreed by my teenager) was to use a second onion and some mushrooms. I have also made this with the addition of cooked crumbled bacon and used marble cheese instead of cheddar... all good!  Great recipe... easy, different and very versatile and delicious!",
