For milk, I used 1% milk... canned non-fat milk would have been good, too.  For the Parmesan cheese, I used the non-fat kind that is sold in a shaker can.  I used leftover poached salmon (skin removed), rather than smoked.  And, I was out of fresh spinach, so thawed a box of frozen chopped spinach and used it.  This tasted so rich, with a wonderful blend of flavors.  It is easy to eat low fat foods, when they taste this great!  Thanks for sharing the recipe Shane.",

I only had skim milk and the sauce wouldn't have been creamy without it. I also used freshly grated parmesan; I wouldn't used the canned stuff. Used about 1 tsp of dried oregano since I didn't have fresh oregano on hand. Baked salmon in the oven rather than using smoked salmon (seasoned with a little olive oil and italian seasoning). Also added some toasted almond slivers (very nice addition!). I would have preferred pine nuts but did not have any. Otherwise followed the recipe and we were pleased. My husband doesn't like fish so I put very little salmon in his bowl. He actually added more fish! I couldn't believe it.",

The only thing I would change is to maybe add a little white wine to the sauce. The blend of oregano capers & smoked salmon was wonderful. I used fresh oregano from my herb garden & it was perfect. I also used bow tie pasta instead of fettuccine. It was very pretty & would be great to serve to company with a salad & crescent rolls.",

I've made it at least 4 times and it only gets better everytime I make it! -Used some of the modifications sugg. by another fan of this recipe and with some of my own little changes it is now a perfection! I saute the fresh spinach with some garlic and olive oil along with the sundried tomatoes and italian spices then once that's cooked just enough I add it to the white sauce. I even used the baby size shrimps instead of the salmon a couple of times and it was super!",

Also I started off by lightly frying a finely chopped small onion & garlic in some of the sundried tomato oil. I must agree the end result is as good as a restaurant dish!
