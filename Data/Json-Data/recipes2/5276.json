You can't even taste the fresh baby spinach! I began by scaling the recipe down to 2 servings. I added the milk, the spinach, and the peppermints in the blender and blended well so as to get all the spinach and candy ground up.  Then I added the ice cream and blended. The only thing I will be more careful about next time is  that I will add the milk in smaller increments since the full amount seemed to make it thinner than I like.  Two servings used only a little more than 2 T. of the spinach, so it turned out a very pale mint green color. A little more spinach would not change the taste and would probably make it a little greener, if desired.",

Next time, I'll make a single recipe, which I think would be about 2 large shakes, then repeat the recipe as needed for more shakes.  By doubling it, the milk, spinach and candy foamed up so much that I had to pour half the mixture into a holding container so there was room in the blender to add ice cream. I used reduced fat chocolate chip ice cream (yummy!).  Next time, I'll dribble chocolate syrup down the inside of the glass before adding  the shake.",
