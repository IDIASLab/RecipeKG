Never mind dinner,  I could have served this and this alone and I think everyone would have been happy. Hubs had requested I make an ice cream dessert for our Memorial Day cook-out and I was less than enthusiastic. None of the recipes really tripped my trigger, but I finally settled on this one, I guess because it called for something homemade and not processed - the fudge.  Sure, you could take the easy way out and use a jarred fudge sauce but this was so easy to make it's not really worth it to take the shortcut.  I wasn't expecting much from this dessert. After all, it's basically just a hot fudge sundae, right?  WRONG.  This stuff is good - awesome good. Just a few cookie crumbs, some ice cream, fudge, peanuts and some whipped topping, but man, put them all together and you've got a dessert that everyone loved and that truly made a dinner get-together finale memorable.  None of us knew what a Buster Bar was, but all agreed this was \"D good.\"  This was the first, but not nearly the last, time I'll be making this.  I followed the recipe exactly, but thought the dessert would look a little naked with just the Cool Whip topping (curious, too, that the Cool Whip didn't even offend me in this dessert!) so I sprinkled it with more Oreo cookie crumbs.  (One other bonus - the crust actually comes out of the pan intact!)",

One tip, buy 1/2 gallon box of ice cream, open the package completely and simply slice the ice cream into 1 inch thick pieces and lay them over your crust.  No softening of the ice cream required! Which means you can spread your fudge sauce immediately! Makes the entire assembly process much faster. Enjoy!",

I made my own homemade vanilla ice cream instead of using store-bought. I then cut the rest of the recipe down to fit in a springform pan. The fudge sauce in the recipe alone is a keeper. Don't forget the spanish roasted peanuts! I found Planter's Roasted Spanish Peanuts w/Sea Salt at my local grocery store. I was also able to spread out each layer on top of another without having the freeze into between.",

This dessert is very durable for transport & of course, being frozen, keeps well. Made it twice now with good results both times. \n\nDivergences, suggestions: Make sauce first, allow to cool. Soften ice cream, layer on crust, press chopped nut layer in while soft. Put in freezer until hard-set, then spread fudge sauce over top & sprinkle with any additional nuts as desired. (This prevents layers blending/rising/etc.) Subbing sweetened condensed milk for the evap + sugar works & eliminates the boiling process. A brownie or cookie base is a nice alternative to the crumb crust. Additional chopped peanuts on top of the fudge layer are pretty. Other flavor combos to consider are caramel/cashew, butterscotch/pecan, chocolate/pretzel, marshmallow/walnut instead of fudge/peanut. Alternative ice cream flavors can also introduce variety. Good recipe as presented, tremendous capacity for variation as well.",
