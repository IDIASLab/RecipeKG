If this is your first experience with acv, I would suggest making the recipe as is and altering it to your taste later. The great thing about this recipe is it can be altered quite a bit. If you like more honey, less cinnamon, more water, etc. You want to make sure you get in atleast 1 tbsp of acv to get the full benefit but the rest can be altered to taste. I am so grateful for this recipe. It sure beats just adding acv to cold water. 1 cup a day will make your digestive system happy and is even thought to help regulate glucose levels in diabetics. Although this needs more research, the vitamins and minerals are enough to drink a cup of day. Just replace this with your morning cup of joe or evening cup of tea and your body will thank you later. It is suggested to carry the most benefits in the morning on an empty stomach. The last and most important point is to use \"RAW\" and \"UNFILTERED\" acv with the \"MOTHER\" (meaning it looks cloudy with a bunch of stuff floating around). Bragg is a great brand that is easy to find. I found mine in my local GNC store. Whole Foods or other health food stores should also carry it but in my experience you probably won't find it at your local grocery store.",
