My suggestion would be to stir up all the ingredients expect for the biscuits then add those in last. I did it as described and the biscuits kind of clumped up and it was hard to mix in the other ingredients. I had to modify because I didn't have some of the ingredients and it was still great! No bacon cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella onion powder garlic powder and just regular parmesan. Yum! Our family could have eaten 3 pans of it I think.",
