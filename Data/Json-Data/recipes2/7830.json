I don't know if it was the fast acting yeast or what but these were so light and fluffy! We had friends for dinner and everyone raved about them. I formed them into 8 rolls and they ended up huge like hamburger buns! So easy to make too! I brushed mine with a beaten egg white before baking which gave a nice finish. Thank you for the recipe!",

Only change was used 2 cups wheat flour and 1 cup bread flour as I was short on wheat flour. I was a little nervous about the amount of sugar but used the 1/4 cup. Not overly sweet, just right. Buttered tops before baking too. Just yummy! Will save this one for sure!",
