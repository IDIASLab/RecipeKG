I sliced up one medium sweet potato and that made 4 plates worth. The first couple batches were just seasoned with salt. The third batch I added red curry powder and the last batch had cinnamon. All amazing so much so that I didn't have time to take a pic! In my microwave 4:30 was a good time. When they're hot they might be a tiny big soft but once they cool they crisp up nicely. Thanks for the great recipe! So much healthier than store bought fried chips!",

                "reviewBody": "AMAZING! I have been deep frying and oven toasting all kinds of potatoes for years with limited success. I will never waste the energy or resources again. I used an everyday dinner plate. Probably could put salt pepper or whatever on after cooking. A mandolin definitely helps keeps slices consistent in thickness. Put the thicker slices towards the middle because that's where it gets hot first. After a couple minutes you may want to flip them because they tend to stick to the plate. Keep an eye on them because too much time will make them black. A single layer is best and this works with regular taters too just may take less time. And if you need a lot make them in batches. It only takes a few minutes each batch. If you oil them remember a little oil goes a long way. I never cared for sweet tater chips I made them for my wife. She loves them and I'm a big fan. Thanks for helping me get to the \"root\" of the problem; )",
