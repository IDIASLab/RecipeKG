First of all, I feel that there was way too much butter in this...the bacon drippings already add enough fat/moisture. Mostly though, my issue was the almonds. I added them at the time that was directed...and they burned (and I only had the burner on the '2' setting)...so I suggest adding the almonds in at the very end (maybe toasting them in the toaster oven first). So pretty much just reduce the butter significantly & add the almonds at the very end! ",

To remedy I would suggest the following:  Cook the bacon and remove from skillet. Add the butter and the almonds. When almonds are golden brown, remove them and add the beans to the bacon drippings/butter mixture. Reduce to medium heat to cook the beans and stir them often.  Crumble the bacon when it's cool enough to do so.  Add bacon and almonds back into the skillet for the last two or three minutes of cooking (to reheat them).  I will definitely make this again with the above modification.  Very tasty and easy to make and everyone liked them.",
