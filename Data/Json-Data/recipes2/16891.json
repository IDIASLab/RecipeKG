I omitted the walnuts because of personal preference (I did taste the salad with a few but I didn't think they added much flavor--just a nice crunch) and I used black olives because I didn't have kalamata. I used 4 oz of feta instead of 6 oz because that's the size of the container I had but I think next time I'll use about half that amount. The basil added such a wonderful flavor and the creamy avocado gave the dish a great texture. It didn't make the greatest leftovers though--best eaten on the first night.",

I could have EASILY made a double batch and it would have all disappeared. I really feel the fresh basil is a must dried really wouldn't give it the same vibrant flavor.
