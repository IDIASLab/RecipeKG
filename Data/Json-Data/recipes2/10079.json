Our son is a vegan and I'm taking a big bowl in to work tomorrow for him! We may add in milk or soy milk tomorrow.I did use extra carrot's as another reader did. It took a while for the celery to cook down and i used olive oil for that,plenty of onion in the veggie broth so i didn't need to use more than a half of a small onion...!! will make this again many times!! a great way to get fresh celery and carrots on the dinner menu!!!",

Again, I used red onions because that was all I had.  I put all the veggies through a stick chopper.\nThey were so nicely done, I didn't even bother with pureeing.  I am getting ready to do another batch this evening.\nThis recipe is a definite keeper for family, guests and take along for potlucks. It deserves 5 stars but some people may think I am exaggerating.  Awesome soup.",
