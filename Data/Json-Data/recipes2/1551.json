But having said that when layered the way the recipe was layered. The taste was way better mixed with the other flavors and not notice the weird back taste that the pudding mix gave off in the beginning. I will make again but won't be using evaporated milk will use regular milk in it's place. The whole idea and the ease of the recipe was great. Just not so much with the evaporated milk in this.",
