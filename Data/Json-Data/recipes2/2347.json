Used a dry white Riesling wine.  Added in cracked black pepper and 1T onion powder on top of the chopped sweet onion.  Also added in a bloop of powdered stevia.  I skipped direction #1 and soaked the seeds overnight with the wine and vinegar.  Went to step 3 and blended the seeds and liquid with the water, raw onion and garlic, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I then simmered on the stove about 30 minutes.  Canned, put 3-12 oz jars up and 1, 1/4TH full jar in fridge.  DELICIOUS!",
