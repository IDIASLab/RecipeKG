I typically shy away from recipes with condensed soup in them because I don't like the richness/saltiness that it usually gives but the sauce this recipe makes is so good you can't even tell condensed soup was used. The only suggestion I have is to use two cans instead of one. One can just didn't seem to make quite enough sauce but two would be perfect.",

The one recommendation I would make is to increase the cream of mushroom soup to two cans. I used three pork chops and 2.5 cups of rice with one can of cream of mushroom soup and it was just right for my fiance and me. Therefore with 4 cups of rice it may not be saucy enough. I seasoned the porkshops and added thinly slice onions to the garlic and pork chops. These were a great add if you like onions.",
