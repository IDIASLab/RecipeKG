There was no conceivable way to roll this into a piecrust. I did however press it into the pie plate. It did brown up just like regular pie crust though. I did not care for the overpowering taste of the macadamia nuts. They are best eaten in small doses if you ask me and for 5 a bottle I'll try another recipe. thanks for the effort though",

I think I may have messed up and left out about 1/2 of the nuts so this may be my own fault but I didn't like to initial flavor so I added about a tsp of cinnamon to the crust. I thought it rolled out just fine. I tried making a pretty edge to the crust which was easy to do but would not cut through at the edges so I don't recommend doing that. Also this seemed a little soggy under the filling and not crispy and flaky. I am going to try this again with a pecan pie making sure I use the right amount of nuts this time to see if that makes a difference.",
