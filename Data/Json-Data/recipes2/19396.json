We did take the recommendation of rotisserie chicken and that worked very well. We usually make our own cranberry sauce but as we couldn't find any cranberries we picked up some pre-made sauce in a container (not can) from Trader Joe's. Pretty good stuff. I think next time I will only use the sauce as the base and not also mix the chicken in it the cranberries can take over the pizza. Also I was conservative and did not use as much brie as suggested. Next time more brie!",
