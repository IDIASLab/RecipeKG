I boiled 5 medium sized red potatoes that were cubed in a vegetarian chicken broth. In a separate pan I sauteed a full onion and about 6 cloves of garlic that I minced in a food processor. I took a host of tomatoes from the garden and pulsed them in the food processor and added it to the onions and garlic and reduced this mixture. This I added to the potatoes and kale. I always de-stem kale (the main stem) I think it reduces the bitterness - I also chopped it finely. I used no other spices other than extra salt and pepper. It really needs nothing. So impressive and simple. I WILL make this again - so easy to add variable vegetables from the garden. Thanks so much for posting!",

I did cook a little longer at the end, just because I wanted the kale cooked a bit more.***Made again and this time I doubled the recipe and used a can of diced tomatoes.  I thought this gave too much of a tomato taste so next time back to just a tomato.  Did add some garlic again to the onion while sauteing.***Made again and used Roma tomatoes instead of can and it was good. Forgot the garlic this time and I could taste the difference.",
