This is a local cheese manufacturer and willbe difficult although not impossible for you Easterners\" to obtain. Everyone knows that Northern California cheese is second to none and hence the difficulty to obtain. I worse comes to worse and you can not get it emeil me and I will ask the owner to oblige you.

I used crab claw meat and approx 8-10 small to medium cooked peeled and deveined shrimp and Jarlsberg cheese. I used a Ulu to chop the crab shrimp and cooked mushrooms together. The omelet came out super fluffy (like it does in fine restaurants). Otherwise I followed the recipe to the \"T\". I would rate this a 9.5 out of 10. Only change I will make next time is to set my electric stove top to a setting of 6 instead of 6.5 as it came out just a bit browned on the top.",
