I used an 8.5 oz packet of quinoa and brown rice and because I used shredded pork from leftover carnitas I added about 1/4 c. BBQ sauce to the 1 1/2 c of meat. I also accidentally used 3 eggs instead of 2. That was my error but it still turned out really well. I don't have a mini-muffin tin so I used a regular size tin and baked them for 28-30 minutes. This perfectly filled 12 regular-sized muffin. My family really liked the taste. I will make them again.",

Since I am using up leftovers and have odd amounts of meat my rule of thumb is equal amounts of meat cooked rice and cheese and adjust eggs accordingly. I usually sub onion for the beans. It doesn't have to be BBQ sauce either. I've used it with leftovers in other kinds of sauces including chicken tikka masala. The only downside is they sticks to the paper liners really bad so I use non-stick baking tins without the paper liners.",
