I used 12 oz of cod filet (nice firm white fish) and I also added a stalk of celery finely chopped to the onion. I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and some milk to get the right consistency and a couple of dashes of hot sauce. It needed salt very badly! and oh I cooked the potatoes mostly in chicken broth. Guess I changed it somewhat but t was really delicous. My 90 yr old dad said it was just like mom used to make....a real complement for sure!",

I made a white sauce (to thicken my milk a bit). I used whiting (about 4 fillets. I cooked the celery and bacon before adding it to the crock. Cooked it on high for about 4 hours - came out delicious! Even our kids loved it.",

This time I added celery mushrooms & scallions w/ the bacon & onion sautee also used half & half instead of milk and chicken broth in place of the water for potatoes. I also added 1 can of corn - again I used leftovers grilled swordfish steaks in a terriyaki marinade. I have not tried raw fish yet but this recipe will work with anything - very versitile and absolutely perfect!! I get such great compliments on this dish you have to try this!
