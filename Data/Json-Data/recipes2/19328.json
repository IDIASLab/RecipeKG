The mango was so diluted with the whipped cream and egg whites that the flavor not to mention the color suffered. The amount of honey didn't seem generous enough so I sweetened the cream with 2 T. of sugar as I whipped it. Even with that I wouldn't call the finished mousse sweet and I can't imagine how even MORE boring and flat this would have been without the additional sweetener. Further I agree with another reviewer who remarked that the texture was \"odd\" - indeed it was and I agree with her that it is because of the puree which still of course retains fibrous bits of mango. For a succinct way of describing this this tastes like mildly mango flavored non-smooth egg whites. The rich juicy sweet mango would have been infinitely better on its own or even topped with fresh whipped cream. I don't necessarily have to have a rich sweet robustly flavored dessert but this all but put my taste buds to sleep.",

If you need the color to be more \"mangoish \" then just add some food coloring it won't ruin the flavor. I've never had Cuban mango mousse before and just maybe it's not supposed to be super sweet. Just saying.............. I halved the recipe and the only thing I did differently was add a little more lime juice just because I had some extra. If anything I think the lime juice enhanced the mousse's flavor. I thought the texture was fine the flavor mellow and wouldn't hesitate to make this again. A nice light ending to a summer meal!",
