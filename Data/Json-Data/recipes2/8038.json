A traditional risotto is cooked with a warm broth, added slowly, to create a creamy consistency. I remember my Nana would make a cup of coffee and grab her stool and sit at a stove for an hour while preparing risotto! As a paleo dish, it takes less time to prepare and the cauliflower gives it a perfect risotto feel.",

The one thing I did not like about the recipe is the color the cauliflower turns as soon as you add the vinegar. I recommend using a white balsamic instead of the dark one that I used. This has a nice earthy taste to it and would go with many different things. Thanks for sharing!",
