Half way through realizing this was not going to work I made a few without nuts. I \"ribboned\" the caramel from the spoon onto the apples and twirled it. Then proceeded to blow on it and kept swirling. Once I laid it on the paper it didn't drop as much but definitely still dropped. I made sure the apples were extremely dry also. Once it \"hardened\" I tried to manually squeeze the caramel around the apple with my hands but alas my efforts just made them a big sticky mess. Giving up I just stuck one in my mouth just to see how it tastes. And if it wasn't delicious. Someone needs to figure out how to make the caramel stick! It will be delicious!",
