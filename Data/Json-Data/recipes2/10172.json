I tried your technique and just loved it!\nMy changes...I used a large carrot rather than mushrooms, no fennel or oregano and I did not deseed as I wanted it spicy.  I used peppers from my garden so don't know what kind they are...they get passed down every year, nor did I add a sweet pepper although I may next time. We do not use as a dip but rather as a spread to augment, or additive to sauces and soups.  It was delicious.  Thank you!",
