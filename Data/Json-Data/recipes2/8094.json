As far as the coating falling off, it works better if you use a spatula when you turn and not a fork. Also make sure the panko mixture is dry when you coat. It tends to start getting moist when you roll the meat. Thanks everyone for your reviews!",

(Though I often do not go to the trouble of refrigerating after coating in the buttermilk or after I coat with bread crumbs and it turns out just fine.) This recipe is great just the way it is (not every recipe has to be absolutely bursting with flavor and/or spicy heat some simpler recipes are great just the way they are - that's what we usually call comfort food! ). But... it can also be considered a starting point if you choose to leave out or add other herbs spices or ingredients. One tip place a cooling rack on a cookie sheet or shallow pan and bake your chicken on the rack. No soggy bottoms!:)",

It helps things like this to get crispy on the bottom, and lets most of the oil drain away. Just shoot a small spot of pam, right where the chicken piece will set, then shoot the top of the piece like the author says to.  Seriously yummy!! Tonight I'm making chicken cordon bleu with this same exact coating. Great recipe!",
