I added mushrooms to give a bit more variety and therefore needed a bit more wine / water to make it a bit more 'saucy'. I still found it was only enough for about 3 people so add more tofu or other vegetables for 4 people. The 'bourgignon' taste was great and worked really well as the wine soaks into the tofu... yum!",

The previous reviewer said that the tofu soaked up the red wine flavor...I don't think it did. The tofu was a little bland. Also the 15-20 minutes simmering did not thicken the sauce so I had to add 1 tablespoon of cornstarch/water slurry at the end to help it along. If you are serving this as a side dish then it produces 4 servings. However if you are preparing this for a main course you do only get 3 servings tops. This was an okay dish but I probably would not make again. It was a lot of effort for something that was just a little too bland.",

I did make a few changes as I added more mushrooms and instead of one fresh tomato I added 1 can of stewed tomatoes which gave the sauce more juice. I did not have a problem with the sauce not getting thick after simmering it. However the tofu was not very good with it. It did not soak up the red wine flavor even after simmering for 45 minutes so it was very bland. Also even one whole package of tofu was too much for me--any beginning vegetarian should only use half of a package at most. In addition the look of purple tofu is not very appetizing. I will use this recipe again but I will use ground burger-style vegetarian crumbles instead of tofu or just make the tomato sauce by itself and serve it over some penne pasta or liguine.",
