I just dumped everything in the crock pot and cooked on high for 3 hours and it couldn't have been easier. Everyone is asking for the recipie. Thanks for sharing!",

So I thought chili would be a safe start.  We were both a little freaked out about the vegetarian meat substitute so I remembered a chili I've had from Pullman, WA where we went to college (they grow a ton of lentils) and substituted lentils.  I boiled 2 cups of lentils according to the directions on the bag and added it to the dish instead of the meat crumbles.  It came out AWESOME.  I hope others try my lentil substitute, because it was really amazing.  Great recipe!",
