This recipe fit perfectly with the only needed modification being the use of Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free 1 to 1 Baking Flour. I usually add applesauce to my GF desserts and breads to keep them moist. It was already a part of this recipe adding coconut oil. The cake came out fabulously! The taste was great and it didn't have the gritty feel that can often accompany GF cakes and breads.
