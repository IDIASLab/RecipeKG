As written it seems a little heavy on the cilantro and the tomatoes although a bunch of cilantro is vague. Also I didn t cube the avocadoes preferring the guacamole to be a little less chunky. I normally add cumin to my guac but Hubs and I both agree this was really good without it and as this recipe s first reviewer I happily endorse it.",
