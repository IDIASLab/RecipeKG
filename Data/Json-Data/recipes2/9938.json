                "reviewBody": "4.29.17 I baked these on a rack over a foil-lined baking sheet so as they were cooking the fat from the sausage drained rather than having the egg sit in a little puddle of grease on the parchment paper. Sitting on the rack the egg cooked all over so there s no need to turn every 10 minutes either. I used Italian Panko Crumbs (what I had on hand) and I think a little salt mixed into the crumbs prior to breading would be a nice addition. One tip when you re wrapping the sausage around the hard boiled egg is to keep your hands wet so you can get the egg completely covered more easily. These are baked so they re healthier than the traditional deep fried Scotch egg so they ll never brown up or look quite as appealing. BUT they still taste delicious. Served with Mustard Cream Sauce from this site. Thumbs up from us!",

I was able to make all 12 eggs with 1lb of sausage but some of mine popped open during baking, so next time I'll pick up a little more than a pound of loose sausage from my butcher to make sure they stay sealed.\n\nThey were tasty but did not come out crispy.  I used regular breadcrumbs and they might have been too fine, maybe try panko.  Wish I had read the other reviews before making - definitely would try putting them on a wire rack rather than directly on parchment.  They'll probably never be as good as fried but an excellent and much less messy alternative - thank you!",
