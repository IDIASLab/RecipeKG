I used red leaf lettuce and a little bit of fresh spinach; all around it had a lovely presentation. (I served this with Creamy Curried Pumpkin Soup and Irish Soda Bread also found on this site.) I was intrigued by the idea of the pear and cream cheese mixture as the predominant dressing agent in the salad: it was delectable. The hubby also liked it although my roommate (who's favorite food is Kraft macaroni and cheese) thought there was \"too much going on with it.\" To me that was final proof that although the salad was simple to make it comes off as beaufifully complex and a delight to multiple senses.",

Could be a little on the sweeter side so next time I will watch the amount of french dressing.I used fresh and they were delicious. I also used dried prunes instead of dates as I did not have any. Its a good alternative though. Thanks for a pretty salad recipe. I think I will certainly make it again and also for company!",
