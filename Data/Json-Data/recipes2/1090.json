I used my homemade pesto and simply decreased the amount of olive oil.  Also, because the packet said creamy I used light cream instead of milk. Simple adjusments that work out very well.  I used Johnsonville sweet sausage.   It came out perfect. The flavor combination is spot on.  Everyone loved it.",

Less sausage is better because it allows the pasta flavor to shine through and don't shy away from the Parmesan.
