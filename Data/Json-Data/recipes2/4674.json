So now I'm testing it again after 15 more minutes thinking maybe I can salvage it but I certainly can't serve it to guests. Well now that I have calmed down I have amended my review to 4 stars and not 5 because the cake fell however when I turned it out of the bundt pan it looked perfect I frosted it and served it to guests with rave reviews. Everyone said it was really really good! I'd like to make it again if someone can give any thoughts on why it fell in the middle.",
