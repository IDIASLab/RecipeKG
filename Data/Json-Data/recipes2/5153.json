Next time I will cut the sausage rounds in half or even quarters for easier eating and to brown them all over. So easy full of flavor. The kiddos barely had time to wash up before dinner was ready.

I used a couple of tablespoons of canola oil and browned the sausage on medium high, then added Green pepper and Onions (not called for but should be), while stir frying for some minutes (didn't count).  Then I mixed a teaspoon or so of corn flour into the pineapple juice and allowed to slightly thicken, stirring until peppers and onions were  slightly crunchy.  Finally I added the Chili Garlic Sauce and heated through.  Served over white rice.  Delicious indeed.  The next time I make this I shall use pineapple with syrup as I think the pineapple flavor needs to be brought out more.\nI have now made this two times and have it perfected to my liking.   For my liking the recipe has too much meat so I split the meat lengthwise and then cut into sections.  Then I browned the meat on med high for a few minutes , adding 2 each chopped green peppers and onion (not called for), then stir frying until partially cooked.  Then I thickened the syrup from a 20 oz can of pineapple, and added this to the skillet with the pineapple chunks.  Finally I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and the chili garlic sauce and blended. This made two batches and several days worth of meals.",

I adapted the recipe and put in the mini sweet peppers as mentioned here along with onions - usually red and sometimes some broccoli crowns if I have them on hand with pineapple juice and pineapple chunks and a little bit of garlic. I also used the sweet thick soy sauce instead of the regular one and add that to it as well. Once it is thick I put it over basmati rice with the tops of some fresh green onions chopped and added a little of fresh cilantro. Next time I think I will try adding the chili sauce along with the thick sweet soy. Delicious and very easy; thanks for bringing back memories.....will be making this very soon again!",
