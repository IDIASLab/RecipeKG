Someone else said the Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies was too hot so I just used a can of regular diced tomatoes, (I'm not a fan of hot spices).  I also used 2 Cups of Basmati rice instead of one because 1 cup didn't sound like it would be enough, and of course, I added at least 2 extra cups of water in order to hydrate the extra cup of rice that I used.  \n\nThe original recipe seemed like it would be a little bland, without many spices, so I added 1 tsp cumin, 2 teaspoons Oregano, 2 teaspoons salt, 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper, 1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 small can of sliced black olives chopped, and a handful of green olives chopped.  Remember I used 2 Cups of rice instead of one, so these amounts of spices might be a little too much if  just one cup of rice is used.",
