I've tried some of the other fruit pizza recipes and have these comments - the cream cheese and marshmallow combination is by far the best of all the recipes, there is no need for any type of glaze on this - it is perfectly sweet without it, and finally, I find store bought sugar cookie dough to be the easiest to work w/ and tastes/sets up the best (I think the dough recipe ones taste too much like cream of tartar). I let the dough cylinder get to almost room temp, then shaped into a disk, placed saran wrap on top and rolled it/pressed it on the pizza pan. Baked until entire top was light brown and let it cool completly before spreading chilled cream cheese mixture on top. I think chilling the final product in the fridge (for around 5 hours in my case) helped the taste of this pizza as well. Used blueberries and sliced strawberries for the fruit.",

                "reviewBody": "This is such a great recipe - and an even better crowd pleaser!  I've been making Fruit Pizza similar to this for about 15 years now, and each time I know it will be enjoyed by everyone.  You can make it year-round, and vary the fruits depending on the season.  I've found that canned sliced pineapple (drained), canned sliced peaches, bananas, strawberries and kiwi are a great combination.  The key to keeping the fruit fresh (especially the bananas) is to pour a lemon sauce all over the top after you've assembled everything.  This \"sets\" the fruit and keeps things fresh.  The sauce is the pineapple juice, 1/3 cup real lemon juice, and 1/4 cup sugar.  Heat and stir until this boils, then slowly stir in cornstarch (that's been dissolved in a little cold water).  Cool completely.  In fact, if you make this first, it will be cooled by the time you're ready for it.  You want the consistency of this syrup to be sorta thick like kayro syrup.  Pour over fruit and then refrigerate a couple of hours.  Also, the Fruit Pizza does well made in a rectangle pan, too.  It's easier to serve, and can be made to be as attractive as a round pizza is!  Either way, it's a great treat for everyone you serve it to!\r\n",

I sliced my cookie dough into rounds and pressed them together in a well greased pizza pan.  This recipe is so versatile and would work great with just about any combination of fruit.  I'm definitely going to play around with this one in the future.  Thanks Lois for a perfect ending to any meal!!",

The cookie dough was very sticky and hard to spread evenly in the pan (I even tried using a rolling pin but that didn't work.) My \"crust\" was perfect on the edges but not done in the center because it was not spread evenly enough. Maybe my dough was too warm and should have been colder to start with? Then it stuck to the pan badly like another reviewer said and crumbled and cracked when I carefully tried to pry it off. I ended up throwing the whole thing away because it could not be salvaged. Parts that WERE edible were delicious though. I will try this again but will make the actual cookies first and will then \"frost\" each one and add the fruit to make little individual fruit pizzas.",
