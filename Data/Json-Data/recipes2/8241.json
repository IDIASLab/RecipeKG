I still have no idea what two cups of pasta means, but I used about 4 oz of the pasta as well as some capellini pasta for my husband.   I always wondered how to make marinated artichoke hearts, and this recipe tells you how!  I served this with some chicken breasts using a chicken rub from this site.  It was very tasty, and I'm grateful that we have some leftovers for tomorrow night.  I know this will go over well as leftovers!  Thank you!",
