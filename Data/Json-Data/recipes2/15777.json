With a little help from my sister (who lives in the US) we discovered that Mars Bars are the equivalent to the US Milky Way bars. You need to use \"king size\" Mars Bars or 6 of the regular size.  Happy baking!  You'll be sure to love this one!",

I like the peanuts from the last two candy bars but they do not melt as well as the Milky Way. The mixture becomes more liquified instead of thick and rich. They also need to be refrigerated longer. I like the topping on them because I don't think they look finished without it. Quick and easy recipe!!",

Instead of chocolate chips using Cadbury milk chocolate bars is much better topping (nicer consistency and taste). I also prefer to serve these at room temperature so they aren't so hard.
