I used Hellman's light mayo and regular horseradish vs. cream style - you can adjust the amount to your tastes. I  used pickle relish vs. chopping a dill pickle. I also added some finely chopped celery and a bit of salt and pepper. I put this on toasted whole grain bread along with the Swiss cheese, tomato slices, and some crisp lettuce leaves. Overall, very good with a nice \"kick\"!",
