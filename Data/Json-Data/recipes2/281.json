All in all this had nice flavor w/ the sausage and the sage and a nice peppery taste that we all enjoyed. I served this over homemade biscuits and scrambled eggs. I would make this again!

I used the proportions per the recipe except for a couple details or changes: 1) I used sage flavored Tennessee Pride instead of adding rubbed sage. 2) I used two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and one of extra light. Left a noticeable but subtle flavor of the oil in the final result, was good in my opinion. 3) I used one tbsp of ground pepper rather than two, and it still was peppery. I like it but the family wouldn't. 4) I used 4 cups of milk rather than 5. Came out in a good consistency, for me anyway. Recommend it.",
