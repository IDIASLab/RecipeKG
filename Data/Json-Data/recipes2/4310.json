Today I checked with an oven thermometer (our church kitchen has a huge expensive almost-brand-new industrial expensive stainless steel range/oven--and did I mention expensive?) but it was on point. Next time I would check it after 25-30 minutes. It wasn't overdone to the point of being burned but it definitely was in too long. I used a 13x9\" glass baking dish; maybe I should have turned the oven down 25 degrees like you're supposed to do when baking a cake in a glass dish. I assembled it the night before and baked it at church during the service. The only modifications I made were to omit the bell pepper which I abhor and instead of putting cheese on the top I just put the extra inside the casserole. It was very good!",
