To speed up the cooking process cook squash in microwave cut-side down in 1/2 in. of water for about 10 minutes. I sauteed fresh mushrooms and fresh spinach with the onion and added some minced garlic seasoned salt and pepper. I mixed mozzarella cheese in with the squash (about 3/4 c) and added a few dashes of hot sauce. Instead of bread cubes I used homemade whole wheat garlic croutons. It was delicious with unique flavoring!",
