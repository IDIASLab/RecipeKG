This was wonderful with braised and buttered cabbage. I had to cut the recipe way down since there are only two in my household.  Four potatoes, 8 anchovies, and I used half/half for the cream. I might use just a bit fewer anchovies next time.  I enjoy stories so thought I'd share this story I found about Mr. Janssen and his tempting dish:  http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-first-catch-your-anchovies-1295644.html",

I used 12 anchovies instead of 20 and I liked it - it was not overly fishy that way. This dish was a hit at a Swedish Christmas party (julfest) I attended. Thanks for the recipe!",
