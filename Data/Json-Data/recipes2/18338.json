For better results mix the sugar and vanilla together first adding a splash of milk to help combine. THEN go out and retrieve the snow. It melts remarkably fast once it gets inside. Don't premeasure the milk and just dump it in. Instead add as necessary to make your desired consistency. Because this is the week before Christmas we have egg nog in the fridge and used it instead of milk and it made the treat creamy and oh so yummy! For those who don't like overly sweet treats you may want to reduce the sugar and/or vanilla if using egg nog instead of milk. We didn't but then we liked it super sweet. Enjoy!",

Thank you.....I stirred the sugar and vanilla into the milk and put it into the freezer for 1/2 hour to make it kind of slushy before heading outside to make the snow pudding. It stirred in really well and it was a wonderful treat.",
