For my pinto beans I bought a can and threw em in a pan with a splash of oil and half an onion sliced. Heated them up then mashed em. Slathered all the ingredients onto my bolillos. Folks this is key: slather. Don't be cheap. I like my Queso Fresco thinly sliced instead of crumbled but that's just me. I also really like the Daisy brand sour cream. (Sour cream is a staple in Mexican dishes so I have tasted quite a few brands). Another thing is get a nice head of lettuce it taste so much better with big fresh whole leaves instead of the pre-packaged thinly shredded flimsy stuff. I left out the cilantro and tomatoes. These tortas are the bomb folks.",
