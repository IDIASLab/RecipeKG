I use Emmentaler swiss cheese melts very well and is cheaper than Gruyere.  If I can't find button mushrooms I use regular sliced mushrooms.  I add a little flour and water (before adding the scallops)  to the sauce so it's not too runny.  And very important...the bread crumbs.  I use plain Panko (Japanese style) bread crumbs...so much better than the fine bread crumbs and I squeeze a little lemon juice into the melted butter and Panko crumbs. Let the casserole stand for a few minutes after removing from the oven to allow the sauce to thicken.  Better than any restaurant!",

Apart from that followed recipe exactly and it was fabulously good. The other half practically burst into song and said it was the best Coquilles St Jacques he'd ever had. What we both loved about it was that the balance of the wine in the sauce was perfect - sometimes restaurants use so much it's overpowering. Will definitely make again. And again. And again.

Whatever he did this was beyond 5-star delicious and decadent. Prepared in porcelain shell dishes this was impressive and elegant as well as lip-smacking good.",

Once that all blended together turn off the heat add the scallops and a splash of cream....maybe 2-3 tblspns. Amazing!",
