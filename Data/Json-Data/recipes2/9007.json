After an hour and 45 minutes I turned it down to low and left it cooking with the lid and paper towel because I was concerned it was starting to burn. Total cooking time was 2 hours and 15 minutes (and 30 minutes of that time was on low). I suggest you do not disturb it at all for 1.5 hours and then check on it. Also I substituted coconut extract for the vanilla in the frosting. Other than the hassle over the cooking time the cake was excellent.",

One side was a little burned and it was pretty crispy on the edges even where it wasn't burned. My crock pot clearly doesn't heat evenly though (which I'd always suspected) and I do not fault the recipe for that. When I checked on it after cooking for 1 hr 15 mins the burned side was already too dark but the center was not cooked- it needed a full hour and a half before it was cooked through. (We cut the burned part off and it was fine.)",
