My friend Daisy, a physician's wife from Burma, made this for me, and although it is time consuming, it is one of the best dishes I have every had. Shan's&reg; biryani mix can be found at any Indian or Middle Eastern Market. According to Daisy, the dish isn't the same without the seasoning and the dish does have a spicy kick to it. I like to serve it with a sauce of plain yogurt mixed with mango chutney and cilantro on the side to cool it down.",
