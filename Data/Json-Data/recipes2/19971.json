This goes together in a snap, and because the key ingredients (of grated cheese and both dressings) are all equal quantities, it is easy to make a huge bowl or a small bowl without any major calculations.   As long as I put the same quantity of each in, the recipe comes out perfectly.  Once I have the pasta, cheese and dressings together, I use whatever produce looks best at the store--not just bell peppers.  Sometimes I use cherry tomatoes or a can of drained, chopped artichokes which is wonderful.   (BTW, I make it with the Dreamfields low carb pasta, and no one knows the difference.)  My much beloved nieces crave this recipe.  Once, when I sent the leftover salad home with my niece, her dad ate it out of the fridge.  She had a complete melt-down, laying on the floor, sobbing (20 years old!)   I'm sure it was hormones, but I like to think it was my salad.",
