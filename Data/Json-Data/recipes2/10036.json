He raved about it and it caught my attention - it's hard to think of something that isn't even better with bacon so I decided to give it a whirl. As a popcorn purist I kept it plain and simple - just popped the popcorn in the bacon grease (didn't measure either) and added a little salt. It really was quite good! While it won't take the place of real buttered popcorn for me it was an interesting variation I enjoyed.",
