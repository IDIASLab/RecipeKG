After reading the reviews, I opted to use hashbrowns instead of French Fries, and I shredded my own potatoes rather than using frozen -- mostly to make sure the potatoes would cook thoroughly.  They cooked fine, but the dish is really not very appetizing to look at when made this way with hash browns.  Next time, I will use potato slices that I parboil for a few minutes first to ensure they cook through.  I will also add some sauted onions and garlic, along with some salt and pepper to taste.  Will definitely use more Cheddar Cheese next time too.  Even without my changes though, I think this is a great comfort food and my whole family liked it.",
