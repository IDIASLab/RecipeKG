                "reviewBody": "I bought pre-cubed EXTRA FIRM tofu for this. I drained the water and I didn't freeze it for 24 hours but only till It was frozen and left it in the fridge. I used Atkins Teryaki sauce and it wasn't the least bit overpowering. I only added enough sauce to coat and slightly marinate the tofu. I also just layered the pineapples on the top and used about 1/2 cup of pineapple juice just incase. I marinated the tofu for about an hour. The problem with this recipe is it has a very basic flavor. So try to spice it up a bit with a little seasoning (make sure it will mesh well with the pineapple and teryaki). Tofu taste like whatever it's cooked in so you don't have to use very much of anthing to get a good flavor. I cooked it in the over till it was bubbly and I mixed it around a couple of times to coat the pineapple. After it was done cooking I broiled it for about 5 minutes. I placed the tofu and pineapples on teriyaki noodles and it was FABULOUS. even my dad enjoyed it and he isn't a big fan of tofu. If this recipe did not work for you you must of done something wrong. Tofu is very hard to work with.",
