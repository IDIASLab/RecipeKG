This recipe popped up when I searched for \"beef butternut.\"  I chose it as there's no cumin in it.  I like cumin, but think it is used too much.\n\nWhile the recipe with no doubt be great as it stands.  I know my, and my wife's tastes, so I modified it a little with a tablespoon of tomato paste.  \n\nI omitted the honey as I was out of it. When I sampled it, I added another half teapoon of cinnamon and salted to taste.  \n\nI did not add oil in step 2.  Instead I deglazed the pan with a small amount of Warka Pilser.  We also had the Warka with the chili and recommend a Dark Pilser beer with this,\n\nNo beans were added, but I might add in the future as I plan to do a vegan version.  We loved this recipe and plan to make it often and substitute beef with beans for a Meatless Monday meal.",
