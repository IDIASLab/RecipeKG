While not totally as wonderful as mom's crust, it's pretty darned close.  Note: if you don't have sweet onions available, I've found that steaming regular yellow onions works very well as a substitute. A great dish reheated as well.",

Instead of making this as a side-dish I decided to make it a main dish by adding a pound of ground beef. Before assembling the pie I browned the beef adding salt and garlic. I used only two BIG sweet onions and steamed those before-hand to assure that they'd be cooked. When assembling the pie I used layers: one layer of onions then a layer of beef then a layer of sliced Velveeta cheese then I repeated one time. After putting the last layer of Velveete cheese I poured about 1/4 cup of milk over top. Then I placed the final pie crust with slits. Even though my meat and onions were fully cooked to start with I still baked the pie for the assigned time to assure that I'd have fabulously melted cheese and a thoroughly cooked crust. The end result was a delicious meat cheese and onion pie that was SO GOOD! Somewhat of a cheeseburger pie really. It's so good--you've just gotta try it!",
