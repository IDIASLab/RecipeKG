I love a classic meat sauce as much as the next half-Italian, but when I want something quick and easy for a weeknight meal, I reach for the tuna. What if you don't like fish? Then this is perfect. The taste and texture is really closer to a veal sauce than one made with fish.",

I cheated by not making the sauce of this recipe the last time by using Chef John's \"Hide The Little Fish\" pasta/pizza sauce that I had leftover in the fridge and it was great! I prefer using imported pasta from Italy because it is pressed through bronze extruding equipment that gives the pasta more texture and that makes any sauce stick to it a little more. Another tip: ~ 1 teaspoon of anchovy paste equals 1 anchovy filet. I keep a tube of anchovy paste in my fridge for sauce recipes like this or for my Caesar salad dressing recipe.",

I like to saute my tuna fish for a minute or so after putting the garlic in and use my immersion blender on my tomatoes before adding it into the pot.  I also like to simmer it covered an hour or so.  Thank you for reminding me of another great economical way of getting fish  into my diet.",

We needed enough for two plus lunches tomorrow and it worked out pretty well for four servings. Used three anchovies 4 tbsp capers olive oil but had to substitute reserved tuna water white wine vinegar a tiny bit of mirin and enough water to make 1 cup of liquid to replace the 1/2 cup of white wine that is called for. Added that and then reduced it down to about 6 tbsp liquid then added one can of red pasta sauce and one can of diced Italian style tomatoes thickened it then added the two cans of drained tuna and the parsley. Thickened it a bit more and then added very al dente vegetable spaghetti noodles (1 lb. when dry) and let it finish. Used double spices and subbed Italian seasoning for oregano. We garnished with lots of fresh parsley shredded Italian cheese blend ( out of Parmesan ) some of the olive oil from the anchovies and a little minced anchovy cause we love them.. Awesome! A small mixed green salad with a slightly sweet vinaigrette some crusty bread and a slice of cheesecake would have made this restaurant worthy lol. Note: doubling the red pepper and cayenne was fine the first day but a little spicier than necessary the next day (still good though.)",
