I used a full 8oz bag of mexican cheese. I did everything else the same as the recipe. The toppings we used were sour cream, salsa, olives, and jalapeno peppers. My husband and three kids loved every bit of it. D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S",

I added some garlic powder, minced garlic, chili powder, and cumin to the mixture too. I will probably use this method of preparing chicken for our other Mexican dishes. The flavor combination was just great. We even ate the (few) leftovers the next day, even though the chips were soggy from being in the fridge. This one's a keeper. Thanks Michelle!",

THEN - my second tweek; I added Sazon Goya seasoning and some fajita seasoning as well as an onion to the chicken as I cooked it.  I cooked the heck out of the chicken and chopped it very fine.  Pop it in the oven,  pull it out, plop some sour cream and salsa on it and WOW!  Superb!  Thanks again!",

Instead of using already shredded mexican cheese I used some jarred cheese sauce and added additional fresh shredded monterey jack and cheddar cheese. My family devoured this! We had never made nachos at home. We liked the fact that they didn't come out soggy. Will definitely make again using ground turkey sausage and beef.",
