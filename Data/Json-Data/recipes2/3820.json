I followed the recipe and the rice never got cooked all the way.In fact it burnt to the bottom of the skillet and most of the liquid had cooked down so there wasn't much of a sauce. I recommend cooking the rice seprately. Other than that this was really tasty. Served with a side of summer veggies(squash zuccini broccoli cauliflower).",

Does this look anything like the original recipe? Guess not but it gave me a good idea to start with so I could get dinner on the table.",

I made the rice by the box directions substituting chicken broth for water. I flash fried the pork (about 5 mins on each side) and seasoned them well. Then I used chicken broth preserves and mustard to make a sauce. Brought that to a boil then added the pork and let it simmer in the sauce till the meat was cooked all the way through. Finished by mixing it all together. The sauce had an amazing flavor and the meat was very tender! I would try adding some veggies to make it more of a stir fry but a very good starter recipe!",
