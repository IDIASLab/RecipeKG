It is not as creamy as those make with yogurt and/or milk but definitely easy and quick. After a taste test my only change was adding some more fruit to take away some of the tartness of the orange juice. I could have drank it either way but my daughter preferred it (and I agree) with a few more strawberries and touch more banana. Also if you are looking for that slushy texture but don't want to water it down with too many ice cubes use frozen bananas & strawberries... you could even freeze some OJ in ice cube trays! We might try that! Overall a good quick easy way to get in a great serving of fruits!!",

It was flavorful refreshing pleasantly sweet a litte tart and creamy even tho' there is no cream milk or yogurt in it which in by book is refreshing enough in itself.
