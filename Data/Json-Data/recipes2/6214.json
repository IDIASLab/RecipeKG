I didn't bother microwaving the raisins to make them soft, I just let them soak in the milk/egg/cereal mixture for five minutes.  I used all-purpose flour as opposed to wheat and 2 Tbsp. of veg. oil instead of melted butter.  I also added 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar.  These made exactly 12 muffins that rose up nicely and they were done in 20 minutes - perfect!",

I also used white flour and subbed blueberries instead of raisins.  They were very moist and tasty.  I did bake them at 400 but they were ready in 15 minutes.  I'll keep this in my files and definately make again.",

My 9 year old wanted to sign up on here to tell you all that even though she really, really doesn't like raisins you don't even know they are in here. I have made several batches during the last week and they are wonderful every time, friends raved as well.  I use the following substitutions: SOY MILK instead of dairy, 1 Tbs OIL & 1 Tbs APPLESAUCE instead of butter.  I like to add 3/4 tsp BAKING POWDER for just a little fluff and I prefer Granny Smith apples not only for the tartness but also for the pretty flecks of green from the peel. I have even substituted 1/3 ground oat and flax for 1/3 of the flour (that I ground myself when I was short on WW flour) and they still turned out light & moist. This will replace my refrigerator muffin mix as they are well worth the bit of time. Thank you for sharing Roxie's recipe :)",

I used Raisin Bran Cereal instead of using raisins and plain bran cereal. I soaked the cereal in the milk and egg for almost 10 minutes-just while i was getting the other ingredients together. Also used 2 Tbsp of applesauce instead of butter and 1/3 cup honey as others had suggested. I also used all organic ingredients which i think makes it taste better. I will surely be making these again and again. Might try making them different ways. A handful of walnuts would sure top them off! OH and my daughter LOVED them. She kept asking for more. Eventually had to cut her off, lol.",

It was perfect like it was just be sure to fill your muffin cups full b/c they do not rise much. My huband said these were the moistest muffins he's ever had. My kids couldn't get enough of them.

I opted for dried blueberries instead of raisins and used a bran flake cereal with strawberries in it for more of a berry medley muffin which worked out well. The banana added a subtle layer of flavor. I was worried that the banana plus shredded apple would provide too much moisture however they weren't over moist. There is just enough though to ensure that these won't keep for long.",
