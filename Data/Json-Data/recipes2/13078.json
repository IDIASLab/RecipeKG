Definately drain the salmon and use the liquid as needed.We double the recipe and added 3 tbls of minced onion and one extra tbls of red wine vinegar left the cappers whole and added some of the brine liquid (loved the \"tanginess\" of the finished product. My daughters liked it and my 10 yr. old asked me to make it for her school lunch. Canned salmon can be expensive up to 5.99 for a 14.5 oz. can but at wal-mart it only costs 2.74 for the big can very inexpensive if you have this with a salad/soup for a weeknight meal:)",
