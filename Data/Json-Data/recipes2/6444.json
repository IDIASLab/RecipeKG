I was worried these would still carry the sweetness of the potatoes but it's totally mellow and not sweet at all. They definitely need a dip or a sauce because they're a little dry but they're versatile so you could add anything to suit what you're making. They would probably be good as a substitute for meatballs in a red sauce pasta dish. The only thing is change would be to add salt to the mixture. It's too bland without it. I added salt afterwards while they were still hot and they were fine. I'll be experimenting with these again!",

I had to use 3 Tbsp of mayonnaise instead of the egg. I served them with some tartar sauce and the tanginess of the capers complimented the sweet potato and onion quite well. The oatmeal was more of a texture input than flavour I think. I served these as an appetiser with Popa's Pickled Eggs (there's why I had no egg left for this dish) marinated artichoke hearts and mild banana peppers. The texture went well with the artichoke hearts but the flavour with the vinegary/hot peppers and pickled eggs really sent it over the top. I used left over baked sweet potatoes that had been in the fridge for 2 days and they came out perfectly. I obviously don't know what size a golf ball is so I was able to get 14 balls out of one batch. Thank you Sueb for the recipe.",
