Serve with tacos, nachos, tortilla chips, black beans, refried beans, or fajitas or use as an ingredient in many Mexican recipes. My family uses it as a side in which to dip grilled steak. If you like it hot, then this is for you; this pico is not for the faint of heart. It is very hot, which most people in my circle like. If you don't like highly spicy dishes, you might might want to try something less spicy or cut down the jalapeno and use a type pepper that is more to your taste.",

White onion was great though. (BTW - I found the red onion about a half hour after I had made this.) Next time. Thanks!",

I am not giving it 5 stars for several reasons: I find that salsa recipes stating quantities of tomatoes and onions are inaccurate as tomato sizes vary largely. I replaced \"2 tomatoes\" to be \"two CUPS of tomatoes\" and likewise for the onion. The 2:1 ratio for tomatoes and onion in Pico seems to work really well. I did the same with the cilantro converting the sprigs into tablespoons. After it was all said and done I added sugar to mine (would be 1.5 teaspoons for the original recipe) as this always seems to just finish off a good pico for us. Kudos on NO VINEGAR as I feel vinegar ruins pico. The lime juice quantity was a bit more than other recipes I have used and we were pleasantly surprised at the wonderful difference it made.",
