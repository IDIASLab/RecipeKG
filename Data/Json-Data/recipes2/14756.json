It might also benefit from using a little lemon juice in place of some of the vinegar, but all around really good as is. Thanks Kelly.",

But I had to review it because I got such great ideas from the recipe and the other reviewers.

With all the additions it made the biggest batch of pasta salad I have ever seen but I have no doubt that we will finish it in a few days. I did stick with just 8 oz of pasta and that was enough for my huge batch. And I only added 1/3 c each of red wine vinegar and EVOO. I probably could add a touch more vinegar but overall this is awesome! I can't get enough of this salad!",
