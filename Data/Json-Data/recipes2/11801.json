        "description": "There are not that many desserts with persimmons. However, they are very healthy and make your desserts delicious and naturally sweet without adding sugar. They will also make the texture of your cheesecakes more sophisticated. The cake is good on the same day or on the next day. If you want to eat it on the next day, keep it in the fridge uncovered. Your cookie pastry is still very soft and fresh. If you cover it, it will become soggy.",
