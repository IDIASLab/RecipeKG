Take time to freeze this dessert after spreading the chocolate sauce on the first and second layers of graham crackers. If you don't, you'll lose those sharp, clean lines. The recipe calls for vanilla and chocolate ice cream, but try any flavor that complements the graham crackers and chocolate.",

This was not convenient so we just melted some marshmallows with a bit of milk in a saucepan and poured it over the dessert just before serving. Another suggestion might be to use the ready-made marshmallow frosting and spread it over the top. You might also try peanut butter flavoured ice cream. My cousin accidently put 4 cups of vanilla ice cream instead of 2 cups but it was unanimous that the dessert was better with the extra ice cream so I'd recommend putting a bit more ice cream than the recipe calls for. All in all a very good dessert - most people had two helpings. Will definitely make again.",

After I made it I thought it was boring sounding but boy was I wrong! Yummy! Looked nice too with the lines of chocolate and vanilla and chocolate ice cream! I didnt do any thing with the marshmellows...left those out completely! A keeper!",
