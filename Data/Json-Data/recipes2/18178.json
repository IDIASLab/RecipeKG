I did use about 1 pound of chicken and almost 1 pound of shrimp (just to use it up). After I poured in the sauce I thought it was a bit too thick so I added a little water to the jar closed it and shook it to 'clean' it out and poured that in too. The flavors are really REALLY good and everything seems to compliment each other nicely! This is definitly gonna be a repeat recipe in our house YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
