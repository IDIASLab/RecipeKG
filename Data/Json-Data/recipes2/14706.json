Also, I added 2 teaspoons of minced galic and I chopped up 2 red bell peppers to add another flavor. It was great and I was requested to make it again for Christmas dinner!",

Cooks would have better luck substituting brocolli or spinach for the eggplant. The minute I read \"boil\" the eggplant I had doubts. But that is just me; I love this quirky vegtable but it must be either panfried or oven baked at high temperature. This recipe is not a total failure it smells good and looks inviting all brown and crunchy on top- I just prefer my eggplant anything but boiled. Thank you anyway.",

I went with some of the reviewers and amended it a little: added cayenne pepper to the bread crumbs (not sure how much, just dumped a good bit in there), used zucchini instead of yellow squash (and didn't peel it), and instead of boiling the squash and eggplant I sauteed them with the onions and some garlic, along with pepper and some other seasonings. I only had one small eggplant so it didn't look like enough stuff - so I threw in one chopped raw red bell pepper, tossed it all up with the green chilis and put the crackers and cheese on top. Topped it off with a few sprinkles of paprika and baked it. The cayenne gave it a nice kick! ",
