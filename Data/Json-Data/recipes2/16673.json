I also agree with the other reviewers - chop up the grapes in tiny pieces and put a lot of them on there. The grapes are absolutely needed to give depth and flavor to this appetizer. I was slightly disappointed by the lack of flavor but think it can be altered by stir frying the pecans in brown sugar/butter and using a lot of grapes. Easy good recipe - thanks!",
