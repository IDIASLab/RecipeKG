Very healthy snack with no flour sugar or dairy. Although Apricots are high in sugar. I guess we could use any dried fruit. Wonderful thanks",

I'll grind up the nuts and apricots then sprinkle the cinnamon on the top of the mixture and then pulse until the cinnamon is incorporated. You could probably get away with adding half the amount of almond extract as that flavor might was just a little too dominant (at least for me). Each truffle is just a pop of fruity sweetness; nice and easy recipe.",
