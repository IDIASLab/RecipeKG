Why not just completely grill the corn getting more of the grilled flavor and save yourself a dirty pot to wash later? Lots of fresh flavors here and that little pop of balsamic really brightens the salad. I didn't miss the oil that you often find in grilled corn salads. This has very good eye appeal and was a tasty side kick to grilled pork chops.",
