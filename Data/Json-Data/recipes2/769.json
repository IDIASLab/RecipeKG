It is much healthier than regular chocolate mousse. Try adapting it further by adding coffee for a mocha mousse, peanut butter, or even strawberry jelly! It can be served immediately but it will set up further when chilled.",

I think next time I might try using unsweetened chocolate and adding the same amount of sugar. I used a combo of 60 64 and 70% chocolate (odds and ends from the freezer) and used a hand mixer (because I hate washing the food processor) and it was fine. Probably could have been even better in that or the blender but was still pretty great. I used a scale to measure and another possibility to make it less sweet could have been more tofu. My package was 16 ounces and it called for 12 so maybe if I had used it all it would have been a little more mellow. Overall pretty enjoyable and I would make it again.",
