But as this recipe s first reviewer I felt it was important to prepare the recipe exactly allowing future cooks to make tweaks if they so chose to based on my experience with the original recipe. For my tastes I didn t see this as a full sandwich but I liked the submitter s suggestion of tea sandwiches. Working off that I just spooned it onto crostini and sprinkled them with chopped green onion for a garnish of color. Unfortunately I regret to say that my first instinct about the mustard was correct it was a real deal breaker for me. It dominated pure and simple masking all other flavors including the beautiful shrimp I used for this recipe. (I used 16-20 count which really is much too expensive to be chopped up but it s what I had on hand). Just a suggestion if you re going to use the mustard at all (and frankly I wouldn t) start off with a much smaller amount. You can always add more but you can t take it away. It s a shame - were it not for the mustard I know I really would have liked this. Also this is rich too rich I think to eat as a full sandwich.",
