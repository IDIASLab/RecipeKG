This is one of those recipes where you need to be able to adjust on the fly to what you need -- I used bottled lime juice so I just guessed at it and added a little extra later. Not every lime yields the same amount of juice so keep more OJ handy in case you need to dilute this sauce to get the saltiness down and taste as you go! Thanks ajt1120 I think this is my new favorite dipping sauce!",

Also i didn't have sesame oil so i just upped the amount of sesame seeds used to give the sauce more sesame flavor. A little spicy for me but i don't like a lot of heat. Next time a little less pepper. Over all a wonderful and versatile sauce.",
