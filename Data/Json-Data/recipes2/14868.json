Oh also I saw a tip on another toasted sandwich recipe from this site saying to keep it from getting soggy is to toast the bread first. It works and I'll never go back to the old way! I lightly toast the bread let it cool on wooden cutting board (so butter won't melt) then butter and grill.",

THIS IS EXACTLY HOW I MAKE MY GRILLED CHEESE! I did not know there was a recipe for a basic grilled cheese? Then again I think I have seen recipes on here for baked potatoes and fried eggs. I haven't come across toast yet but haven't looked! Either way I use somewhat less butter and sometimes 1 1/2 pieces of cheese. Cook the grilled cheese on no higher than 5 and only flip once. No flattening the grilled cheese with a spatula either! Follow this and you will get a buttery crispy delicious grilled cheese.",
