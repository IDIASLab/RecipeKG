Instead of Cream cheese, i used a half can of Mushroom Soup (store brand), and a table spoon of sour cream. I used 3\\4 cup of canned corn and canned carrots to mix with ground beef.  Instead of garlic clove, i substituded garlic powder. I also added dried french onion soup mix and pepper to season. My family ate it all. Wish i had made a bigger dish.",

Now add one package of Lipton soup beef and onion. Once this thickens add it to the meat and vegetables. I also used Idaho instant garlic mash potatoes. Lots of warm flavor on a cold night.
