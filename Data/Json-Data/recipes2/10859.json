Bonus is that any leftover filling makes great breakfast burritos. Made as written and these were great! I did soften the cabbage in the microwave as the recipe submitter suggested. I don't mind the taste of raw cabbage but it just seemed to make them easier to fold up and eat. Don't skip the carrot salsa. It really brings everything together perfectly. Good job bd.weld!",
