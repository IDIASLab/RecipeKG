I chopped them very finely, then blotted off any extra juice they released with a paper towel to keep the frosting from curdling/separating. I also only used 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar and felt that was sweet enough. The flavor of this isn't overwhelmingly strawberry, but it's there. I enjoyed this more after adding some vanilla extract and lemon juice to balance the flavor. The frosting paired well with a vanilla cake I made. Thanks for the recipe!",
