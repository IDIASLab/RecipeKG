I also appreciate that it is a low-fat heart healthy recipe. I cooked the ground turkey/vegetable/spice mixture in a wok. The only problem is that the final product came out too dry. Though I can't say definitively how much I will consider adding more tomato juice or tomato soup to prevent the casserole from being too dry next time. With that fix this dish could easily move from three to four stars.",

Only problem I had was the recipe says to use 16 ozs of pasta. Is that 16 ozs dry or cooked? It definitely is not cooked because I cooked 16 ozs and it way too much. The turkey mixture fills a 9 x 13 casserole half way so you can only put in about 3 cups of pasta before the cheese on top.",
