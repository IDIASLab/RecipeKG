I used gluten-free sandwich cookie crumbs (from which I removed the cream) and baked them in the oven first as I was worried they'd get soggy (7 minutes at 350). There was definitely enough peanut butter/cream cheese mixture to make two more cakes so next time I'll increase the cookie amount a little to accommodate. I also didn't whip the ganache at the end and just poured it on when it had cooled a bit. It made a nice shiny top that I stuck half of a peanut butter cup in. Delicious!",
