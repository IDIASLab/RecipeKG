I stored the leftovers in a sealed plastic bag overnight. The next day the moisture from the pound cake had softened the Chex cereal. I wonder if there's a way to preserve the crunch of the cereal while keeping the softness of the pound cake. I'll definitely make it again but will play with some possibilities (toasting the pound cake squares using day-old pound cake not using a sealed bag or container to store the mix maybe something else if I think of anything). The flavors were still excellent on the second day.",

I made my own pound cake, super yummy, as a sheet cake to make it easier to cut into squares. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding more cake pieces. It turned out nice and will be a fun surprise for my sis who loves tiramisu!",
