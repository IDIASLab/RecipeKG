You can make changes to the recipe based on your preferences or what you have without changing the character of the recipe as long as the three main ingredients--peach corn and tomato--are there. For example both times I made this I forgot to puree the ingredients. It's great just chopped though I will try it the correct way sometime. One time I inadvertently added a lot of extra peach and tomato and it was still good. I like it and the people I have served it to like it. Everyone says it tastes \"fresh.\" It's good with tortilla chips; I have yet to try it on fish or meat. The other change I make is that I use fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. I was afraid that fresh garlic might be overpowering but it's not--just one clove is perfect. I highly recommend this recipe.",

If you have good sweet corn don't bother cooking it first just slice it off the cob and add it. Also I just rough chop everything - we prefer chunky salsa anyway and I like chopping by hand (therapeutic!). I also use one clove fresh garlic instead of the powder and have also sub'd various types of peppers.",
