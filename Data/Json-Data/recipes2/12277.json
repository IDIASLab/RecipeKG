I had everything on hand and I really need a way to get whole oats into my diet so I tried it. I did make it for 1 serving so instead of using the food processor I used my immersion blender on the oatmeal pickle juice and garbanzo beans and then hand chopped the onion pickles & celery. Mixed together with the mayo & mustard. Loved it! I used Klaussen dill pickles and thought the flavor was great could even throw in some sweet pickles too. Definitely a keeper!",

Unlike another reviewer I didn't find the pickle flavour (or dill flavour as she said) too much at all. The only addition I made was salt and pepper. Next time I may use half mayo and half fat free plain Greek yogurt to make it even healthier. I might also swap the regular onion with red onion to make it prettier. Thanks for a great lunch alternative!",
