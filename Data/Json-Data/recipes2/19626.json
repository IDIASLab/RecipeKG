I used half-n-half in place of the milk kale in place of the spinach lots more garlic added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of diced onion with the sausage and added sliced green onion tops with the parsley. I cooked the linguine two minutes shy of al dente (9 min) as it finishes to al dente as you toss it with the sauce and a good splash (1/4 cup or so) of the pasta water. The sauce is very rich but the greens and lemon zest balance the richness. I will make this again!",
