I used vanilla yogurt and only 1 very large banana. I will probably add more oatmeal next time just for personal preference. I need bigger glasses to serve this to adults I used custard cups and they just weren't big enough to hold many bananas for my husband and I but made in smaller portions were perfect for the kids. Thanks a lot for a yummy and very easy recipe!",
