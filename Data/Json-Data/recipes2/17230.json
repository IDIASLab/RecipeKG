I didn't have the knorr's dried veggie packet. I only had dried french onion dip and dried ranch dressing mix so I decided to try it with the french onion. My daughter doesn't like her salsa \"chunky\" so I put it in the food processor to make it smooth. We liked it made with cold salsa and not room temperature. Tasted like a dip a store named Lawson's carries! Next time I will try it with the dried ranch dressing mix or actually what the recipe calls for to give an fair review.",

The only problem was that it was a little too salty for me. next time I will add only half of the soup mix to start with or skim mostly the vegetables off of the top of the soup packet. Would also be good with celery or carrot sticks. Ok time-warp to alot later. It has been a while since I wrote this review. I would just like to suggest to anyone looking for SOMETHING to mix with that sour cream that taco seasoning is the bomb. My son and I discovered that some sour cream mixed with a some of a taco seasoning packet (to taste) is our new must have for bean and cheese tostadas or nachos. I love it with tortilla chips.
