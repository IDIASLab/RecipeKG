I think mushrooms would be a good addition if you like them.  I cannot imagine anyone who likes pepperoni pizza not liking this. It doesn't sit good for very long periods of time. Once it starts cooling down the texture gets a little weird so keep that in mind. This would be a big hit for a SuperBowl party.",

I separated the mixture into two oven-safe 16 ounce bowls and added 5 minutes to the bake time they could of used 10 since they were deeper than the 9 inch pan recommended at the 30 minutes. I have to tell you I never did find the Herb and Garlic soup mix despite looking in multiple stores so I substituted by looking at some suggestions. Thank you!",
