My one complaint would be that the recipe instructed me to cook the tomato until its juices had mostly evaporated, I cooked them for an additional five minutes.  However, the ripe tomatoes continued to leak out  water.  I went ahead with the rest of the recipe steps, but I could never get the tomatoes to stop leaking juices.  After another 10 minutes with the eggs and everything else, I used a lid and strained the juices from the pan.  After that the dish was great and still quite moist.  I agree that it could use a lot of salt and pepper, but the person eating can add that to their own taste.  I could see this being stuffed into tortillas and it needs to be doubled for my family.",
