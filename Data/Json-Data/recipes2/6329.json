Otherwise followed it as written. Since I made a double batch I made them as regular size muffins (a heaping 1/4 cup of mixture in each) and it made 24 of them. Baked them for 25 - 30 mins. They were tasty and healthy... And they were good with a little Sriracha sauce on them.:-) I served them with saut\u00e9ed veggies on the side. Thanks for the recipe!",

There was barely any fat to keep them together! I might make these again but not brown the ground turkey first. I did drizzle hoisin sauce that I mixed with sirachi sauce as I found the recipe VERY bland as well. Wished I liked them more since I made alot of them hoping they would make a good appetizer.",
