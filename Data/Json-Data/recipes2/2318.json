Secondly I used salted honey roasted peanuts makes the sweet and salty ratio balance. I also put green food coloring in one batch of icing. It made it looks so festive and moss like! Lastly this recipe way underestimates the amount of icing and crushed peanuts you will need. I had to triple mine but I coated them very well. This recipe also does not say to refrigerate anything. However i refrigerated the pound cake until completely cooled before cubing and i refrigerated the finished blarney stones when i was done coating them so they could set up overnight. After that it is ok to leave them out as long as it is not too hot. Enjoy!",
