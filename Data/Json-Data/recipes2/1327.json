I did a mixture of vanilla and lemon extract and still wasn't dying to taste one when they came out of the oven. Also they don't look very pretty...if you're going to make a shortbread balls might as well take the extra step and make it into an appealing shape. I'm thinking about putting in some natural coloring next time. Overall: These are hard to mess up and super fast to whip up--just make sure your butter is at the perfect consistency.",

It has a lovely delicate flavor but bland and dry be comparison to what I was expecting. Not sure if I was using salted or unsalted butter that may have made a difference. Additionally I added 1 tsp of almond extract but still felt bland. I think I over cooked them as well as cooking time always takes longer on stoneware. Enjoyed this recipe a lot and will be making again!",
