Our church small group was having an Italian themed potluck dinner and I figured a lot of people would bring pasta dishes so I would give this a try. Unfortunately the Tuscan Chicken Flavor Infused Broth was very overpowering and it was the only things I could really taste. I did not enjoy this and apparently not many others did either. I brought home a pretty full crock pot. I would suggest to others who may want to make it to use regular chicken broth and then season to your taste so that you can savor all the flavors of the dish.",

The leaves of the entire bunch only weighed about 5 ounces and I ended up only using HALF of them in the soup. I can't imagine what it would have been like using the full 20 ounces of kale that the recipe calls for. Overall we thought it was just OK and not something that we'd make again.",
