The bison dogs from High Plains are big and juicy and they fit perfectly inside the big rolls. I used Tillamook mild cheddar cheese just because I'm a fan of the brand and I thought the bison dogs deserved something special. I loved the addition of the cornmeal on the top and bottom also. I didn't add the mayo to the honey mustard but instead combined yellow mustard and honey-I tried some with the mayo and my family wasn't a fan neither was I. The bison meat was rich and I couldn't finish but half of one dog. My 5 year old grandson only finished 3 bites even though he loved them. We aren't used to bison and even though they were good they were very very rich. Would I make them again? Of course! We all got a kick out of eating bison instead of beef for a change-maybe I would serve them with a light salad next time. Only 4 stars because of the dressing and cheese in the original recipe.",
