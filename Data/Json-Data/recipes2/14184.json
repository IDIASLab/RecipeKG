Instead of the Soy Sauce, I used 1/2 cup of Yoshida's Original and then didn't have to use the corn starch, it's already thicker.  Let it marinade for about an hour, and used mixed oriental veggies.  My husband and I love spicy but the kids like it just \"tasty\", this was good!  We added more chili peppers and it was great for us!  (Of course we also added more garlic, love that too!)  We had it over rice, good quick meal!",
