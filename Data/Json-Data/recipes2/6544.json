I always have homemade chicken broth in the freezer for soup -- it's much much better than canned (see my review for chicken broth). To this soup I added half of a chopped onion cracked pepper sea salt fresh basil and a combination of chopped zucchini and yellow squash. I had all the ingredients onhand except for cellophane noodles (so this was omitted) and fresh ginger (so I used small amount of ground ginger) which didn't seem to compromise the flavor. We'll make this often. Note: Especially good for dieters!",

Made it twice so far first time I added carrots instead of zucchini and used gluten free noodles instead of cellophane noodles. I had to add 4 more cups of broth because of the noodles I used but it was great. Second time I poached my chicken breasts first then used the water from that (4 cups worth) and added 4 cups of boxed chicken broth. I doubled the garlic and ginger root because of the extra liquid. I used 1 cup of frozen peas instead of zucchini. I used 2 cups of shredded chicken and 4 cups of spinach and a box of gluten free shell pasta. I love this stuff!! better the second time with the increased garlic and ginger. Thank you for a great recipe that is also very flexible!",

This fits perfectly into my diet - low calorie and low carb with a good amount of protein. I ended up adding an extra 2 cups of broth because the soup was really thick. Even then this definitely is not 8 servings (unless you're planning on tiny bowls). I'd say this is 4 servings if you want a decent-sized portion - so 210cals. Still very healthy! The flavor was good as written but i then added some sliced green onion for garnish and a couple dashes of fish sauce. This would also be excellent with a squirt of lime juice or some thinly sliced jalapeno. Yum!",
