All measurements were the same only substitution I made was almond milk. All ingredients were purchased recently. I ended up thinning out the mixture after trying to cook the original. I'm not sure what the secret to this is possibly mixing it with another flour. Worse cooking experience I've had in years AND I was hungry.:(",
