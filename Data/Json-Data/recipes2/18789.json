I use two pieces of thin cut chicken breast instead of slicing a regluar breast in half, I double the amount of provolone, keep the same ammount of basil, leave out the tomato, double the amount of bacon, and leave off the parmesan.  I cook it on a rack set over a baking sheet so that the bacon will crisp (instead of cook in the juices).This tastes especially good with \"Pasta with Scallops, Zucchini, and Tomatoes\", found here on this site. EDIT: I've made more changes to this dish since I first made it.  I now marinade thin cut chicken breast in Italian dressing overnight, drain it, spread basil pesto on the insides of the chicken, lay double the amount of provolone (smoked provolone is best, yum) on one slice of chicken, top it with another slice of chicken, and wrap it in double the amount of bacon (first lengthwise, then widthwise, then lengthwise again to remove the need for toothpicks).  The basil pesto makes a huge difference and really enhances the taste of the dish, and the more fat the bacon has in it, the better.  It seems to soak into the chicken and leave it extra tender.  Everyone LOVES this recipe!",

I dont have a broiler pan so I had to cook these on just a plain cookie sheet which worked out well minus slightly burning the bacon and setting off the smoke alarms lol. I cooked the bacon for a few minutes in the microwave to make sure it got fully cooked in the oven. also didn't have grated parmesean so I just used mozerella and it was still amazing. My 3 yr old loved it and so did I. I butterflied my chicken and pounded thin before marinading...which I did for about 4 hours before cooking. highly recommend this dish! I also used roma tomatoes...just as a personal preference and would recommend those for this dish",

So if you're watching what you eat feel free to omit the bacon and you'll still have a great dish. Served this with whole wheat speghetti in a white wine olive oil sauce. So the cheese won't spill out while baking try securing the chicken with toothpicks. Soak the toothpicks in water first.",

I used sun-dried tomatoes instead of fresh ones but the flavor of the tomatoes was completely overshadowed by the basil. I couldn't really taste the provolone either. I think the keys to this dish were the marinade basil bacon and parmesan on top. I made my own marinade with fresh crushed garlic Italian seasoning lemon juice olive oil white wine and salt & pepper. If I make it again I might just omit the other ingredients that I couldn't taste and see if it makes a difference. All in all a fabulous recipe!",
