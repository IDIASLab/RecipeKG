Used broth instead of water, added a splash of red wine vinegar at the end for a little acidity (always use vinegar when I'm making chard, spinach or kale) and added capers and olives just to have a bit more interest to the dish. I used the Italian cheeses but I think goat or feta would have been good too - making it more greek than italian. Very tasty, very flexible.",

It didn't make sense to me to only saute the onions for 2 minutes and then add water; I salted them & cooked them way longer to give a little more depth of flavor, and sauteed the garlic for about 30 seconds before adding the liquid (I used broth instead of water).  I also added red pepper flake for a little extra kick.\n\nI LOVE this approach to cooking gnocchi; the browning really takes the flavor and texture up several notches.  Great, healthy, flavorful dish - I'll be making again and again!",

Used green Swiss chard as I find it has a less earthy taste than kale or spinach. I also used a bit of chicken bullion granules with the water but it added too much salt so I will try a low sodium broth and a little red pepper flakes next time for a little extra something. Great weeknight recipe since it was really quick even with the extra cooking time for the ground sausage but using a precooked link would cut down the time and extra dishes.

I added a low-fat hot turkey sausage that I crumbled and it was so complementary to the flavors of the dish. Highly recommended. Thank you so much for the recipe!",
