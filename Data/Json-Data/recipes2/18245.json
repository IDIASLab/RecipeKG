I used the ones in scotch whiskey on ice cream and the brandy soaked ones in black forest cupcakes in place of the cherry topping which is sometimes \"spiked\" with kirsch liqueur. This is a nice alternative to plain cherries and can easily work with your favourite liqueurs. But I'd limit the taste combos with certain liqueurs cause it can be a bad combo or too strong tasting.",

I pour out all the juice (I save it in another jar) add the liquor to half full then add some cherry juice back in. It's the perfect amount of liquor.
