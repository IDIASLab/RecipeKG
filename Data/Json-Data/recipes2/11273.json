Recently I tried grated apple with  1 cup of apple sauce, and a quarter cup of slivered almonds, and pumpkin pie spice. I do add about 1/3 of a cup of Splenda for taste.  I'm also going to try pureed canned butternut squash, as soon as I find some! It could also be good with a grated carrot! I like it chewy, but it could be baked longer for people who prefer crispy.  I recommend a pizza cutter after it cools, to cut it up.",
