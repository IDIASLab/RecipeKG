I added extra garlic and chili's to the vegetable mixture rather than at the end of cooking. And mixed the sauce in the same pan rather than a separate pot as that was simpler. I also added some Sriracha to the sauce to give it a little more heat. When I was making this I thought some sliced ginger might be a nice addition but I don't miss it it's perfect the way it is. The peanuts are what really makes this dish so don't skip them! I also used really flavorful concentrated chicken stock (low sodium) sometimes your ingredients can make or break the dish! I did add some green onions for a final touch which added some freshness and brightness. I will definitely make this again!",
