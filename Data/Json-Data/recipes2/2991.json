I found the addition of the balsamic vinegar added a nice sweetness to the steak off setting the lemon-pepper seasoning slightly. Like another reviewer mentioned the addition of the balsamic does wilt the lettuce a bit and turns the mozz brown but I waited until the steak was done before I dressed the baby spinach. The heat of the steak and naan also caused the spinach to wilt but no-one in our house minded at all. Will definately make this again!",

No matter how good of a brand of balsamic vinegar I have used I find it slightly tart and that the main problem is it just turns vegetables and cheese brown in color. It appears with the topping on this it was no different. It also wilted my spinach and it sat for a very short time while I carved the meat. The main pic for the recipe I believe the ingredients were added in layers and not mixed together. Only change I made was using a little dry basil as I did not have fresh. I found the basil flavor too dominant as I do fresh basil in many recipes. It just didn't come together for me and was rather time consuming for such a simple looking recipe.",
