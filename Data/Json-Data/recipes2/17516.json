Only change I made was I did not infuse the cherries into rum and used a little extra rum... tossed scoops of washed seeded and halved cherries into the blender with ice and rest of the ingredients and got wonderful frozen cherry daiquiris! Will definitely make again with fruits in season! Thanks for a terrific recipe...they kept the party going until dinner was served which was by the way peppered chicken breasts with cherry wine sauce!",
