I only made 3 hard-boiled eggs and used all the yolks in the recipe.  Yes, I did have extra filling, but I just finished it on a cracker or two.  The one change I made was an optional item.  Instead of the dash of hot sauce, I added a sprinkle of the cayenne pepper.  Eggs were delish, and a definite keeper in this house.  Thanks, thehealthyhousewife for sharing.",

I didn't have lime juice on hand so I used lemon, a little more garlic than called for, and left out the turkey bacon (I didn't have any either), added the pepper to the filling and also sprinkled on top.  It had a great flavor, not too heavy, and with just enough kick to make it exciting.  Thank you for sharing.",
