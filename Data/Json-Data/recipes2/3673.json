Both worked good especially the cheese. The flavours were good and not too salty. This is not a gourmet meal but why would you expect that from a dish that literally takes 5 minutes to prepare? Made with rice and poured a little milk in with the chicken before cooking (did not have any more sour cream) to give more sauce. Worked really nice with the rice and I did not have to season the rice at all. Will definitely make again - it is more a meal you make for yourself and not a dinner party where you are trying to showcase/impress.",

Although the first time I make a recipe I like to try it as written my husband doesn't like mushrooms so I substituted cream of chicken soup and fresh green beans. Instead of heating my oven up in nearly-100-degree weather I used the crock pot on low for 8 hours. Then a friend called to invite us out to dinner so I put it in the fridge for the next day. Reheated it in the oven at 200 degrees for 1.5 hours approx. While it was a tad salty it wasn't too much for us. May have been saltier the first day though.",
