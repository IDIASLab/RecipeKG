I started with a \"Cure 81\" boneless half ham. And I've never seen a 6 oz. can of frozen orange juice concentrate, so I just measured half of a 12 oz. can. After basting every 10 minutes for the full hour, the \"glaze\" is still mostly in the roasting pan and not on the ham, although it does thicken up later and is better on the leftovers. The ease of making this recipe, and the fact that so few ingredients add such great flavors, are the major pluses of this recipe.",
