The mozzarella helped \"bind\" everything. I used vine-ripened small tomatoes and their size was perfect. A melon-baller made scooping out the tomatoes a snap. I then let them drain on a paper towel so they wouldn't get mushy. They took about 15 minutes in the oven - - give or take. This was a nice compliment to my Father's Day dinner. Thanks lovedody!",

This is one of my favorite flavor combinations - nothing better than a great tomato with basil and parmesan! I only baked mine 10 minutes basically just to warm them through and then slipped them under the broiler to brown/crisp the parmesan. We'll definitely be having this again this summer while great tomatoes are available. Thank you! 10/15/10 UPDATE: Made these again using sun dried tomato pesto which was equally as wonderful as the basil pesto I used last time! This time I used a melon baller to scoop out the tomato which worked very well.",
