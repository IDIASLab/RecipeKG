I halved the recipe and it worked fine althought it would have been just as good to keep the full amount of grits if not better and easier.. I had large shrimp that I cut into thirds; use the full amount (based on halved) of hotness and after the first surprising 'bite' we decided it had the perfect amount of heat to it. Since there were not much grits I could not layer it so I just poured some shrimp mixture in the pan and then put grits on top and mixed it up; then I did that again madce about three 'layers.' - put the cheese on top baked and it came out super. The smell while cooking was so good too. I will make this again and again. Perfect amount of everything. Mine was not soupy at all. UPDATE - made again for my 85 year od parents from NC and they too LOVED it - in fact loved so much they kept complimenting me on it all during the game. I accidently poured all the can including juice into it; but it was fine. Its now in my 'Favorite' Box. Thanks",

My hubby and I like only a little bit of heat so I skipped the hot pepper sauce and only added a pinch of cayenne. I halved the recipe using only 1 lb. shrimp but I wish that I had kept the grits the full amount. Just be sure to watch the grits and not let them boil over (I ended up scrubbing my stovetop for a while)! We really enjoyed this meal. Creamy yummy goodness!",

When I served it I gave extra hot sauce and cheese to whoever wanted it spicier or cheesier and it was a hit everyone loved it and asked me to make it again! I did intend to halve the recipe and based on previous comments I left the grits at the full amount and I m glad I did. There was big shrimp and plenty of grits and veggies to go around without anything being over powered. The grits were a little runnier than I d have liked so I may either add a little less milk as they loosen when they bake due to the onions tomatoes and shrimp releasing their yummy liquids into the grits. It wasn t Too bad but just a bit beyond where I d like so I ll try by cutting the milk by cup or so.",
