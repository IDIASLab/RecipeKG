I made with Mexican shredded cheese for it was what I had on hand and Bac-O's bacon bits because I wasn't sure the actual specification(which I liked in this)with regular mayo as well. Tasting this alone with crackers can be a bit salty. But having said that using crackers actually takes that saltiness away and compliments the cheese ball. One thing I noticed in the mixing(preferring to the making into a ball) was it being extremely greasy from the mayo and slightly hard to shape. I shaped it after I wrapped in plastic. I would recommend a decrease of mayo by either a 1/8th to 1/4th cup of mayo. But either way it did taste rather good.",
