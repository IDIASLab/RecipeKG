The first batch was so thin I basically baked orange poppyseed paper not cookies. (I made no variations.) So I added flour which made them hard and tasteless. Furthermore a chocolate button is a large chocolate chip which looks really stupid in the middle of a cookie any larger than a quarter and didn't help the flavor of the cookie anyway. This is the first recipe on this site that has failed me but it failed miserably. Sorry. I really wanted to like it.",
