I used Panko for the breadcrumbs and the only thing different I did was use buttermilk instead of the egg wash for the breading/ coating.  Made a basic remoulade sauce to dip and these were pure bliss.  Tip: Not mentioned in the recipe but make sure to let the balls rest for about 15 minutes after breading so that they set properly and when you fry them the coating won't fall apart.
