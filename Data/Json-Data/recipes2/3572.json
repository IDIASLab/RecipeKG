I pounded the boneless skinless chicken breasts between two pieces of saran wrap to make them tender and less thick. I used my fav. teriyaki sauce to marinate and I also sauteed some sliced mushrooms then added some sauce to the mushrooms. I grilled the chicken on wood chunk briquettes (the smoky flavor was amazing). I use swiss or provolone cheese and grill the pineapple per the recipe. I used plain mayo instead of thousand island. My sister suggested to use chipoltle mayo to add a little kick. I may try that next time. Great recipe to add your own touches to!",

Also I'm not a fan of thousand island dressing so I used dijon mustard and instead of the provolone I used muenster jalapeno cheese!

This is the taste we remember we both love it. The Thousand Island dressing makes it great. We like using a soft bun. If you can't find Hawaiian marinade I've had to use a sweet and sour dressing for the marinade and it came out great also. As I make this again today I realize I didn't write previously that I pound the chicken to all one thickness so it cooks more evenly. Also I find with some chicken breasts they are just too big often I can make two sandwiches out of one chicken breast.",
