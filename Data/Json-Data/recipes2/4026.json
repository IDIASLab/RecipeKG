I was thinking about saut\u00e9ing lightly the apple with a little shallot and something to add some color to it. I did use my friend Lissa 's Chai Tea Jelly to top my baked rollup for a little moisture. Also mine did take a little longer than 25 minutes to bake---maybe 10-15 minutes more. I love the idea of this dish and I'll use it again. Thanks!",

I thought it was ok but a little bland which I realize would have been more so had I not added seasonings. The chicken was a little dry as well almost like it needed a sauce of some sort with it. Perhaps with applesauce even. I liked the flavor of apples and chicken together so good to know in the future I can experiment more with those together. My husband seemed to enjoy it the most my teenage daughter ate it as well. I may make it again but will add/adjust things probably. I had to cook it an additional 15 minutes or so to be fully cooked.",
