In my case it was a head of cauliflower! ;)  I agree with other reviewers that 30 minutes is too long to steam the cauliflower. I steamed mine in an electric steamer for 15 minutes and let it drain well. The sauce is great but you will need to adjust it to your own personal tastes -- are you a mayonaise or mustard person. If you have a preference you might want to increase your favorite. In our case we used 2 T mayo to 1 T mustard. I also added a sprinkle of grated cheddar cheese to the top because I was afraid it would dry out too much. Next time I will make a lot more sauce. My family liked it and wanted to taste more of it on the cauliflower. I am going to also try to thicken the sauce some so it will stick to the cauliflower instead of have to be drizzled over the top. Good \"different\" recipe.",

Steamed for only 10 minutes then put the mayo mixture on then topped it with 1/4 cup fresh grated parmesan cheese and broiled it until the cheese was brown and bubbly. I have used American cheese slices as well. SO GOOD. If you add the cheese you dont really need the butter.",
