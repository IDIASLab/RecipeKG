I mix the entire can of beans with salsa - enough to make it easy to spread (we use HOT salsa so the pizza is hot).  I spread the beans on the all ready hot crust and top the beans with LOTS of sharp cheddar cheese.  I cook it in the oven until the cheese is melted and browned.  That's it!  I top slices with lettuce, onion, salsa, sour cream, black olives, etc.  It's the best taco pizza ever.",

I spread the refried beans first which I did add a little homemade taco seasoning then homemade salsa and just topped with shredded lettuce chopped tomatoes and olives and the green onions then the cheese. I then drizzled homemade ranch-mexican dressing over the top. I did not use the tortilla chips only because I don't keep them on hand. Really quick supper and quite enjoyed by my boys.
