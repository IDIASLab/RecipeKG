The curry adds interesting flavor and the raisins are a great compliment to it. I made a few modifications: - I used half turkey and half beef just because it's what I had on hand. - I used Worcestershire sauce instead of hot sauce because I love Worcestershire and kids hot sauce = no. - I added extra ketchup and Worcestershire because I felt it needed more moisture (maybe an extra tablespoon or so of each). I also added a second egg. - I used steel cut oats instead of rolled because that's what I had. It turned out perfect! The steel cut oats added nice nuttiness and texture. Because of my schedule I needed to let the prepped meatloaf sit in the fridge for a few hours before cooking - maybe that allowed the steel cut oats extra time to absorb moisture? - I used celery instead of green pepper because that's what I had. - I added a few tablespoons of capers per suggestion of another reviewer - loved the saltiness with the raisins. - I felt the recipe needed more salt. When I make this again I'll add a teaspoon or so of salt and about a quarter or half teaspoon of pepper.",
