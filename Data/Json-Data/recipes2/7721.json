Even after blending the corn mixture for 2 minutes, it seemed to be very smooth, but as we later realized, there were very small pieces of corn throughout the soup, which gave this an odd mouthfeel. Next time, after we pur\u00e9e the first corn mixture, we will strain it to give this soup better texture. Other than that, great soup!",
