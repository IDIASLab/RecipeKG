However after being delayed in traffic on an empty stomach I decided to just eat one or two of the already cooked tails. Well one or two led to just about all of them! So once I got home I used shrimp that I had in the freezer. This is a quick easy and delicious recipe. I sauteed the onions and bell pepper in 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the cooker before adding any of the other ingredients. I didn't use butter. Also rather than add the green onions at the beginning I stirred them into the rice after it finished cooking. A very good recipe.",

In addition to working as-is it's a fine base recipe for variations depending on what you have on hand.
