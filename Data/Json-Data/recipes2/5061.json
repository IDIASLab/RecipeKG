However, I had to improvise a little b/c I didn't have some of the ingredients and am without a car today, so here's what I did: First, I didn't have any farfalle pasta, but I did have this really cool giant elbow shape, so I went with that. We love, love, love radishes and feta cheese, but I didn't have either so I used sliced black olives and a sharp provolone instead. OMG!!!! This salad is DELICIOUS! My 2 year old tore up a bowl of it at lunch time before it was even chilled...he loved it! It is such a wonderfully different take on traditional pasta salad and I can't wait to get some radishes and feta to make it again, b/c I know it will be even better! Thanks, ADZELL for another winning recipe! :)",

I used a whole 16oz bottle of kraft Greek vinaigrette 5T mayo 6 radishes (chopped super fine with food chopper) 1 whole cucumber 1 can chick peas and 1 can olives (which I think adds alot to the salad in my opinion) I only had 1 cup of feta so thats all I used and thought it still tasted great. This recipe doesnt make a lot so I probably should have quadrupled it because everyone licked the bowl clean. Thank you for sharing. I will be making this again very soon!",
