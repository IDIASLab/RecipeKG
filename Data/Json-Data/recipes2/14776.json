We do add about double the spice and usually I just use pumpkin pie spice. For frosting we use a can of vanilla frosting and beat 4 oz of cream cheese into it and add some pumpkin pie spice. For fall events we decorate each bar with a marshmallow candy pumpkin or candy corn. Everyone I know like this better chilled in the fridge before eating. YUMMY!",

It was a bit dry and needed a lot more spice to make it more of a pumpkin flavor. After tasting that I decided it would make better cookies which it did! They were delicious:) On my second attempt I added a total of 2 tablespoons pumpkin pie spice ( 6 teaspoons) use a mix w/o pudding in the mix and added pumpkin pie flavored pudding mix (found at walmart) 4 eggs (helped solve the dryness) 1/3 cup oil and 1/4 cup milk. The end result was fantastic. I did not use the icing because the proportions were off and instead used my own recipe. I hope this helps!",

I had a spice cake mix laying around (don't even remember what I bought it for in the first place) and figured this was a good way to use it. In spite of the spices already in the mix I prepared this recipe as written including all of the spices. I baked it in a Bundt pan about 45 minutes. If the aroma as it was baking was any indication of how the cake would taste I knew it was going to be good. And it was! It was moist of course as cake mix cakes generally are pretty nutmeg in color richly pumpkin and robustly flavored with spices. And no characteristic cake mix taste which is always a plus for me. I wonder however if that would have been the case had I used the yellow cake mix called for...",
