I sauteed the ground beef with garlic/red pepper (skipped the onion), drained and set aside. Added the chopped eggplant and some chopped mushrooms to the same pan and sauteed in a little olive oil. Then mixed it all together along with the egg, cheese, Panko, herbs, etc. Loved the Panko on top. I think I'll make this again with Italian sausage sometime. Thanks :)",

It was so good My husband absolutely loved it! He wants to try this same recipe in a Portabella mushroom next time.",

The Hubbs liked it but didn't give his normal rave reviews over one of my meals. For me the texture was the deal-breaker. I absolutely LOATHE \"mushy\" and this - though cooked completely as directed with no variatioin - was way too mushy. Then again I'm the person who won't eat the stuffing from within the Thanksgiving turkey because I don't like the soft texture. The flavor was great the house smelled great the eggplant \"shell\" was delicious. If I could have cooked the filling separately and/or had it set up more firmly I'd have loved it.
