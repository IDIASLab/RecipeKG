Added 1 1/2 teaspoons old bay into stuffing mix. Used imitation crab and chopped up that and some large shrimp rather than using the canned products, added water to right consistency since I didn't have the \"juices\". Used about half as much butter. Used flounder fillets. Put a large handful of stuffing on one side and folded the other half over. Basted with butter and sprinkled liberally with old bay and cajun seasoning. Looked awesome. Added a sauce of 1/2 C mayo, 1 T lemon juice, 1 t milk, 1 t Old Bay. Made a pool around the fish and drizzled over. For a fairly simple meal, it looked and tasted out of this world.",

My husband had some with and without the sauce, and we both agree the sauce made what was delicious even better.  I would recommend trying this recipe.",

I used just one talapia filet and topped it with the stuffing. Dredge talapia filet in bread crumbs (I used Italian Seasoned bread crumbs) Lay filets down in a buttered (greased) 13 x 9 pan (I had a glass pan) Spoon the stuffing on top and flatten with the spoon (to make room for MORE stuffing!) Bake at 350 for 25 minutes. As for the stuffing I sauted (sp?) the celery and onion in a bit of olive oil -- again to minimize the butter. That mixture plus the juices from the canned shrimp and crab was plenty to soak the stuffing mix. All in all this recipe was GREAT! Hubby loved it! The stuffing was amazing -- the best part!",

We ended up cutting off the head and butterflying it but leaving the bones in and eating with caution. I didn't have celery and I wish I'd gone to get it at the store before cooking-- the stuffing definitely needs the crunch of the celery. Also added chopped parsley after baking for color and presentation. Go easy on the seasonings- the stuffing can get pretty salty with all of the spices in the stuffing and canned shrimp and crab. Keeps great in the fridge for a few days.",
