The 2nd time I added 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 bunch cilantro.. great!. The 3rd time with salt & cilantro I streamed 1/4 cup olive oil into the blender INSTEAD of the mayo... Delish!!! --no mayo aftertaste healthier and tastier-- it seems to bring out the flavor of the lettuce and cilantro. Update: This is my 5th try (you can tell I love this recipe) and I added 1/2 onion... OMG how flavorful! That's it. I can not improve this further for my taste. A real winner!!! Update 2: How I control the heat: Mildly spicy - remove the seeds and veins from the jalapenos. Spicy hot - remove the seeds only and leave the veins in.",
