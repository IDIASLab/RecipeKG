I really enjoyed the potato/onion/pepper combo (which I seasoned with salt & pepper) and I think it would also make a really great side dish for Mexican-inspired meals. For the steak I added some cumin and instead of using chili powder I used ground chipotle chili peppers. This gave it a great flavor and a little heat. After rubbing the seasonings onto the steak I lightly brushed both sides with olive oil and cooked it to medium on the grill.",
