Considering I have not eaten sweets in 8 weeks I thought it was very refreshing. It's definitely a healthy alternative to sugar laden sweets and snacks and something I don't feel guilty eating. The only problem I see is that the bananas darkened a little. I'm wondering if they will darken even more by tomorrow.",
