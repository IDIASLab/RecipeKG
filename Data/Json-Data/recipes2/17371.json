Sauteeing the squash in butter, however, really aided in the browning factor and gave this a wonderful, rich color. I used a combo of zucchini and yellow squash, fresh garlic rather than garlic powder, and just used the soy sauce and toasted sesame seeds to taste. Very nice presentation and great flavor.  ",

Secondly why does the ingredient list say to divide the soy sauce? The directions have you put it in all at once. Thirdly that's too much soy sauce. I would use 1 tbsp. Instead of using garlic powder I would use 1 clove fresh garlic and also some fresh grated ginger. I would also use olive oil instead of the butter. Also I think 2 tbsp sesame seeds is too much; 1 tbsp would suffice. As written this ends up way too salty and is not enough for 4 adults.",
