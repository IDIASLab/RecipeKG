The coconut milk (keeping low on the water helped make it thicker) flax seed milk pumpkin (I just dipped my Tbsp into a fresh roasted pumpkin) and pumpkin spice mix were all made in house from recipes from this website. I added rice syrup instead of maple. In the end I added 2 Tbsp of coconut oil for a nutrient boost (as if this needed it) and absolutely loved it-and I'm not paleo or vegan. This is simply a great way to flavour coffee and get something good out of it rather than the store bought syrups or additives. Thank you Brooke for your recipe!",
