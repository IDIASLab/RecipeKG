I don't cook it to 145, that's in the medium + range, I only cook mine to about 122-125.  Also 5-10 minutes in the screaming hot oven is usually enough, you just want a crust on it, you don't want to overcook it. Or if you have your grill going, sear it on all sides on the grill.",

The taste was fantastic.  Even my very picky 6-year-old grandson loved it and I thought my son-in-law was going to lick the platter.  New holiday dish is on the list!",

I also poked holes into the roast and inserted whole cloves of garlic throughout.  I used an electric smoker at 200 degrees and smoked with a mix of cherry and a little hickory wood for approx. 3 hours.  Always use a good thermometer though.  I pulled off the smoker at 115 degrees, wrapped in foil and placed into a thermal cooler till the temp got to 123 degrees.  Then I reversed seared directly on a super hot gas grill for about 45 seconds on all sides to create that crispy exterior crust.  This brought the temp up to about 130 degrees and after I let them rest for another 10 minutes, it sliced to perfection. Even pink from end to end with no overcooked parts. The leftovers froze well and I reheated the \"prime rib steaks\" on a hot gas grill for about 1 minute per side till they were just warmed up.  They were almost better than the original prime rib.  The grilling added more smoky goodness and the grill marks added texture.",
