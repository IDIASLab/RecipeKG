I always have those on hand, but King Ranch Casserole is best made with tortilla chips. Yep--Tostitos, Santitos, even Doritos! They will soften up in the sauce & provide a good corn flavor. I've never, ever used actual tortillas.",

(I don't put much stock in reviews that don't evaluate the actual recipe!) Honestly, the flavor is good. my only complaint was the texture. There needs to be something in there with some crunch. Maybe I cut the chicken into pieces that were to small. It would have been better if the peppers or onions had maintained some of their crunch. I'll try it again and maybe not saute the onion and peppers. Or perhaps garnish the top with crushed corn chips. It just needs something to give it more structure. But again, the taste is great!",

Changes I made:  mix of red and yellow onion, low fat/sodium version of the condensed soups, light sour cream, only 1 tsp of cumin, twice the amount of chili powder, 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp. of onion & garlic powders, a Tbsp. of minced garlic with the peppers & onions, several grinds of black pepper and sea salt, 1-2 Tbsp of Frank's Red Hot Wings Buffalo sauce, couple dashes of Tabasco. Believe it or not, it wasn't very spicy-hot after all that. But it definitely needed something, since I was using the healthier soups. That's the great thing about this recipe-- you can make it your own! I also added some tortilla chip pieces on top of each serving for added crunch.",

I myself prefer to substitute chopped green chiles for the RoTel or other brand of tomatoes and chiles, making it more a 'green' as oposed to 'red' casserole and use only white cheeses like jack or asadero or a combination of the two and going with the green chile powders with the exception of cooking the chicken with a little red chile.",
