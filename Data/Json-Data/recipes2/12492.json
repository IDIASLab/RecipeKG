I have long hair and also have to color it due to grays so a deep conditioning is a must for me every month. Edible and hair in the same sentence are a big NO for me so I did not eat this but the solid works great on the hair. I've been using coconut oil in my hair for a couple of years now but this combo worked even better. I am fortunate not to be split end prone but I am prone to tangling and this worked wonders. After freezing I just let it sit out until it was room temp and used it like that. If 20 minutes is all you have then that is okay but I recommend leaving it in for at least an hour. Now that I know this works I'll leave it in overnight next time.",

I found that the milk separated slightly which is not a huge deal. I used 90% of it on my hair as it s longish but since it s been on the oils have warmed from my scalp and have been dripping down my face and back (even with a shower cap on) I will re-evaluate if this works well on the hair as that is the main objective. I would definitely put up with these little issues if it works wonders on my hair. Don t think I could sleep with it on though as oil would be all over the bedding. Part 2- originally gave this 3 stars but changed my rating! I m finding today after washing/drying my hair it looks much healthier after just the one treatment. I m going to use this 2-3 times a week????",
