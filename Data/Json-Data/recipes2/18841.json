Here are some of the things I altered though: I used frozen mango instead of fresh (less work peeling and chopping also adds to the frozen elements). I also made a simple syrup and added about a jigger of that to the mix to add a little sweetness as the mango nectar isn't that sweet. I never use triple sec just a splash of oragne juice and Rose's sweetened lime juice.. buzz away in the mixer with plenty of ice and you're seconds away to happiness in a glass!",

She's not much of a drinker so this waters down and sweetens the recipe and fills up a blender for a party. Enjoy!:)",
