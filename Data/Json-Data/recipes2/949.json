        "description": "This mammoth plate of food features three eggs, a half-pound of meat, and more than enough spinach. Apparently a late-night patron requested his spinach omelet include a hamburger patty, and this is what happened. In respect to good ol' made-up 'Joe,' I've kept the original portions, so feel free to share with a friend or three. This version is mostly meat and spinach, but if you want something closer to a classic scramble, then cut the beef and spinach amounts in half. This is how most restaurants that copy the recipe do it!",

I can't tell!\" to which I responded, \"sweetheart, this is HEAVEN.\" Awful to look at, but I remedied that slightly the 3rd time that I made it by adding 1/2 chopped red bell pepper to the onions. The parmesan and the fresh herbs really add something, as I tried it once w/ dried herbs and cheddar cheese and wasn't nearly as thrilled. Really, as written it is fantastic, but our vote (besides it being a no-question-about-it-Five-Stars) is that it needs 1. Color and 2. 1 more egg. Oh and we love to eat it w/ crusty French bread and a side of steamed squash for some reason!",
