If you eat it after chilled I would add some more salad dressing and some salt an pepper as it tends to get dry and bland after it sits... Would be great as a meal with some chicken cut up in there!",

One change that I made was cutting back on the number of hard-boiled eggs concerned that the eggs would just take over the salad. This was a superb side dish to Kalula Pork (slow cooker) and such a nice break from the same-ole macaroni salad. Love the sweetness from the pineapple and the crunch from the apple. I also love that this can be made early in the day for a no-fuss dinner on a hot summer day. Thanks Alicia we enjoyed this new macaroni salad.",
