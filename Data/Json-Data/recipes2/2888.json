This one pot chili mac was so good I decided to finally get around to setting up account.  The only thing I changed was very minor.  Used petite diced tomatoes in place of rotel (all I had on hand), added about two tablespoons chopped peppers and served cheese on side just because hubby doesn't really like it cooked in.  Very quick and easy! Also delicious!  Will definitely make this again!",

We liked that it wasn't super chili-flavored. It had its own unique taste. We did not want it to just be chili with macaroni added. The only change I made was to skip the beans and add a can of corn. And I probably added a lot more cheese than 3/4 cup - probably twice that in finely shredded taco-style cheese. It melted nicely. I also added some green onions I had on hand when I added the parsely. I'll be making again. Thanks for a great recipe!",
