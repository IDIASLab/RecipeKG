As fate and a chaotic supermarket trip would have it Blueberry became Blackberry. Nevertheless the Chill blue black red or yellow turned out to be a crowd pleaser. Easily made and proudly claimed this dessert became my go-to dish for several events on the special occasion calendar. Blueberry or in my case Blackberry Chill is the ultimate frozen treat I dare you to serve it at a dinner party and get through the evening without hearing how refreshing at least three times. Love it!",
