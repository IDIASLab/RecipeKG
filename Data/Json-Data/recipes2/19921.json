I did as others suggested and went with Key Lime Yoplait NonFat yogurt instead of Lemon, pecans instead of walnuts, seedless green grapes instead of celery, and mandarin oranges instead of a nectarine (but only because nectarines aren't in season). I cut up the apples and put the yogurt in right away to keep them turning brown, then put in the grapes. Don't put in the mandarin oranges, dried cranberries, and pecans until right before serving to keep the oranges from disintegrating (stir them carefully) and to keep the cranberries firm and the pecans crunchy. I strained the yogurt with cheesecloth, and I guess I needed to double the cheesecloth again because some of the yogurt went through. (If you don't strain the yogurt, some of the runny liquid accumulates on the bottom of your fruit salad bowl. Truthfully, I wouldn't know since the hubby wolfed it down so fast! :D)",

Also mandarin oranges and canned apricots (I'll leave those out next time -- too soft).  I followed another reader's advice and added the cranberries just before serving.  I would suggest you do this with the nuts too if you like chewy and crunchy.  The key, I think, is that lemon yogurt.  Seems no matter what fruit you use, that yogurt sets it off just right.  It reminded me of a wonderfully updated Waldorf salad.  There were no kids at my open house, so I have no idea if they would like it -- but I bet they would.",

I received several compliments on the salad, and my husband loved it.

The lemon yogurt is great but so is vanilla and key lime. I have also cut the sweetness of the other flavors of yogurt by adding a half carton of plain non-fat yogurt to the flavored one. By using half plain and half flavored the taste of the fruit is allowed to shine through. YUM!",
