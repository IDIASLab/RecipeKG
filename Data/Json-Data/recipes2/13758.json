My mother-in-law is an excellent cook by the way so I take notice when she likes something. I followed the recipe almost exactly...my cans of cream of mushroom soup were already seasoned with roasted garlic and so I just left out the garlic powder. And I did drain the green beans...the recipe doesn't mention that part which might be helpful for a new cook. Like another reviewer I had never boiled pork before and it worked great. I used whole wheat rotini. All the different textures and tastes were great. Serving size above is listed as 5 I think it would serve at least 8. We had lots of leftovers. (My side dishes were honeyed carrots and kiwi fruit.) I froze some of the leftover casserole...we'll see how it does reheated. Picky little kids who don't like their foods mixed and sauced like mine might enjoy ingredients from this recipe set aside and kept separate for them: pasta cheese green beans small pork bites rice krispies. Then at least they are learning to eat the same foods the adults are.",

I normally make Caramel Apple Pork Chops whenever we have pork but we were looking for something different this time. Since we were in a time crunch I had to make do with what I had on hand. My changes were: - Used a \"family size\" can of cream of chicken soup (26oz) and omitted the mayo. - Added a can of corn in place of the green beans - Only had 4 pork chops on hand - Used egg noodles instead of rotini but upped the amount to 2 cups The result was wonderfully bubbly lightly crispy on top and a little too salty for our tastes. I know pork is salty to begin with but I think it was the cream of chicken that was the real culprit. Next time I'll cut the pork into even smaller pieces and increase the noodles to at least 3 cups. Adding some diced potatoes would add another dimension and combat the saltiness. I think this is a very versatile recipe that lets the user play with ingredients based on what's available.

The crunchy topping was interesting and a good idea but I would cut back on the seasonings a bit as we found it to be too salty.
