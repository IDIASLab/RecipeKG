I generally prefer cheddar or Jack cheese for something like this and was a bit leary of the American cheese. And I could tell it was American but it was very subtle and just blended in with the other flavors. This is not a very spicy dip and is a bit different than some other similar ones but it does have flavor. (And a hot salsa would spice it up if someone wants that. I used mild.) Great with tortilla chips and I wanted to just keep eating the stuff after it was gone. Unfortunately it's not something I would make often cause it's so fattening (even w/low fat cheese milk & vegetarian beans there's still the beef & tortilla chips) and I also try to keep cut back on the red meat. Definitely \"junk\" food. So sad.:-(",
