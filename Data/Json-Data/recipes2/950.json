There is a misconception about Spanish food, we do not have that many spicy dishes at all, far from Mexican food, where they like it hot. A variation is to cut the bread in cubes instead of leaving it whole, and to stir in the egg beaten, like you do with Chinese egg drop soup.",

We've modified it a bit for our tastes like using about 1 lb of cubed ham steak to  4 cartons of stock  and using a combo of sweet, smoked and spicy paprikas.  If you toast your paprika in the oil a bit before adding the stock, it really brings out the flavors. We add a lot of paprika because it's delicious. When we poach the eggs, they always seem to sink to the bottom, but we can still fish them out when serving.  This is also one that gets better as it sits. The bread makes the leftovers almost creamy.  So tasty!",

Didn't have EVOO so just used regular olive oil. I also just used up my remaining ham and thus didn't measure. The biggest changes resulted from my not having a large enough pot: I ended up having to use two, which was rather chaotic. Also, this was probably due to my imperfect measurements, but my eggs didn't really poach properly; rather, they sort of poached but mostly just seeped into the soup dish. Anyway, it was still totally delicious, and I'm now in love with the taste of savory smoked paprika.",
