The lemon-lime soda and the white grape juice add all the sweetness it needs. This recipe minus the syrup fit the bill perfectly for a wedding reception I was catering. Guests were surprised that there was no alcohol in the punch- maybe a little disappointed too! (lol) Since that wedding reception in Aug 2006 I have made this punch 3 or 4 other times to great acclaim. A classy alternative to that yucky red punch we see far too often.",
