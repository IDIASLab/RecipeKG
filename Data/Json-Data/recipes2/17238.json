They were huge in the hot dog bun and my kids could barely finish them. But they said it ROCKS!!!! I made this to a T but using a seedless raspberry sugar-free w/splenda jelly. Topped with golden raisins. Fun quick and easy. I put the peanut butter and jelly in plasitc ziploc baggies and snipped the corners off to pipe easily along the sides of the banana....was totally fun. Thanks for the sweet recipe.",

I thought it was really cute and creative but for some reason I couln't get past the hot dog bun lol. I don't know why it's bread but I just couldn't do it. My son on the other hand really enjoyed it but it was a bit too much for him food wise (he tried though). I did omit the raisins only because I didn't have any and used his favorite grape jelly instead of raspberry. All in all this is a great idea and it made my little guy smile Thanks!:)",
