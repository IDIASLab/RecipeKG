This recipe is the best batch of cinnamon rolls I have ever made!  Family and friends all agreed!\nI was looking for something that would use the yeast I had left over from Christmas.  I was intrigued that this recipe called for \n2 TBS of yeast.  If you are wondering how many packets that would be\n1 packet = 2\u00bc tsp\n2 Tbsp = 6 tsp.\nYou will need 2 whole packets PLUS 1\u00bd tsp. out of a third packet.   A lot of yeast but well worth it.   I did reduce the brown sugar slightly as a personal preference.  The recipe called 1/4 tsp of salt in the caramel topping.  However I did not put the salt in the caramel instead I sprinkled sea salt in the prepared pans.  It gave the sweet caramel just the perfect taste of the the saltiness I have learned to love in my salted caramel candies.  Enjoy!!!!",

I didnt have cream so I used sweetened evap and it was pretty yummy but not as drippy gooey as I'd have hoped. going to try again with fresh flour. I think it's probably a perfect recipe tried by an imperfect baker lol! Thanks",
