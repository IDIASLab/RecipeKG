NO ONE CARES if you think there's too much fat or sugar or whatever in a recipe, we are free to eat what we want and so are you.  Go enjoy your egg whites and mush, I'll have a piece of French toast with BUTTER and spices and real eggs.  Wonder who will enjoy their breakfast the most?  :)  Great recipe, loved the spices and butter, easy to make.  I cook this in a cast iron skillet over a camp fire when we meet up with friends to go on trail rides on our horses and it is a huge hit!  I serve it with BACON and HONEY HAM and skillet potatoes!  If it kills me, at least I enjoyed my meals.",
