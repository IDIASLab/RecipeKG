I enjoyed sampling this dish - but I did add a shake of Cajun seasoning though! I didn't do this but think --- cooked in cast iron over a fire - then served with eggs ham and a cup of black coffee - you could just close your eyes and imagine how they all tasted together on a cold winter morning so long ago. Some may not like the taste of this to fix again - but what a wonderful thing to fix once - especially to let the younger ones know the foods that used to be eaten during the history of our Great Country! Thanks again!",

I used yellow hominy instead of white and made a butter/flour roux after cooking the bacon and before adding everything into the skillet. It really helped thicken it up quickly. Seasoned it with fresh ground pepper and my favorite seasoning salt. Goes great over biscuits or toast! Serve with eggs on the side and sprinkle with chopped parsley or green onions to add some color. Will definitely make it again. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",
