I think I would've liked the pesto better on another type of protein. Perhaps a seared beef on some orrechiette pasta. Really you could use the Pesto on anything. I would make a couple changes to it though. Unfortunately I couldn't find macadamia oil and I wish I had because I think it really is essential to this recipe. There was something about the raw taste of the garlic that I didn't enjoy (and I LOVE garlic)...next time maybe I would use garlic powder or roasted garlic. But overall Thanks for the recipe...it really was an amazing combination of flavors...so many flavors!",

I wanted the salmon to have more flavour so I added a pinch of black pepper thyme garlic powder and oregano before searing it. I used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil to sear the salmon and scallops b/c it has a higher smoke rate. I really enjoyed this recipe!!! I found that using a microplane grater w/ the ginger was extremely beneficial.",
