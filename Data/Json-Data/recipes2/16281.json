I read the reviews about the beef patties being too wet so I cut the catsup and the barbecue sauce in half and added more flour. I cooked these on the grill and had a disaster on my hands because they just fell apart and through the grate. I m giving this recipe 2 stars only because what I was able to salvage actually tasted pretty good sort of like meat loaf. BUT if I want meat loaf I ll turn to one of my meat loaf recipes. I m not going to try to tweak this recipe so that it works rather I m just moving on. Seriously I think this recipe has major flaws as written.",
