I was greatly embarrassed to see how quickly it was disappearing, and ended up with a greatly diluted version before long. I just had to keep adding regular white wine to the mix when the second batch started to empty out. Punch is not hugely popular here, but it certainly was that night!",

The Champagne adds the fizz and it is delightful. On the second batch I used slightly less of the mulled wine and more of the champagne because the spices are strong. Not to worry though. We used up the leftover mulled wine with more champagne the next weekend! It seems to keep quite a while.",

I also added a small amount of cointreau to the saucepan with the apple juice and spices. The frozen fruit ring was great although I was hesitant about the three fruits...it was great! Make a double batch...better to have a little left over than to run out. I have given this recipe to at least a half dozen of my guests. I rate this a 5! Glenys C.",
