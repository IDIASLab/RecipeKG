I was afraid the asparagus would be undercooked so I added it to the saut\u00e9ed veggies about one minute before they were done. I also used bacon instead of ham because I had some bacon already cooked in the freezer. I used more than two slices of provolone because I love cheese in an omelet. The provolone was an unusual ingredient but it added lots of flavor. Mushrooms would also be good. As the author said, it was filling. I only ate about half and it was great reheated the next day.",
