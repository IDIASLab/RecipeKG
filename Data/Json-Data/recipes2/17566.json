                "reviewBody": "OK, here's the deal.  This is the best sandwich ever, but it has to be done right.  There are 2 essential and 2 secondary things people are missing.   Essential 1: real peanut butter - this means no sugar added (not sweetened factory goo) - it's just ground up peanuts (with maybe some salt and palm oil). Sweetened peanut butter spoils the bite of the cheese (see below).  Essential 2: hot sauce - the sandwich is to be dipped in hot sauce.  Not crazy habanero but-in-the-tub stuff, liquid-y hot sauce like Cholula or Tapatio.  It provides essential softness and flavor.  Secondary 1: sharp cheddar cheese only - preferably extra sharp, good cheddar (like Tillamook). The cheese has to compete with your good, real peanut butter.   Secondary 2: whole wheat bread - with the powerful elements of real peanut butter, extra sharp cheddar, and hot sauce, white bread just can't hold its own.  Enjoy!  Convert your friends - they will be appreciative, eventually. Oh, and it goes great with a fresh-from-the-fridge Pabst tallboy.",

I threw the sandwhich together flipped it on my GeorgeForman grill for 5 minutes rotated 45 degrees 3 more minutes (gives it a nice diamond grill pattern) and done.",
