Well, as you can imagine, it had some freezer-burn and I was ready to toss it till my hubby said, why don't you go to that recipe place online and find something to do with the shrimp?!  I found this recipe and we loved it!  I did add a bit of cayenne and a dash of worstershire along with my Tabasco as others had suggested, I chopped up the shrimp and it was fabulous~who knew the shrimp wasn't in its finest form?  It was gone in about 5 minutes and I didn't have to ditch the shrimp!!  Thanks for a keeper!!",
