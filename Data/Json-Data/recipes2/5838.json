Thanks to the ingredient search on AllRecipes I was able to use them in a sort-of new way.

The kids thought this was great--they ate every bite. Next time I'll try this with regular oats I'll just cook it 4 minutes in the microwave.",

I find that it tastes rather like rice pudding; sometimes at night I'll have some of the leftovers cold--then it really tastes like rice pudding.

Cooking in milk makes it taste just like instant oatmeal for those of us who grew up on instant and decided to make the switch to old-fashioned. All you have to do is use 1 part oats to 2 parts whole milk. Cook on med heat and stir constantly til the milk has thickened and the oats are the consistency/texture you prefer. I've used honey to sweeten but when I was out of honey I tried maple syrup and it was delicious as well. It's very filling not to mention packed with tons of vitamins and healthy fats. My kids rave over this every time I fix it. My husband even likes it and he has never cared for oatmeal.",
