This was a great recipe and I just adjusted the timings and covered the tips from beginning. I let it go for about 10-13 minutes in the shaped bowls (tips covered with tinfoil) and then removed the bowls and tin foil and turned upside down for another 8-11 min. Keep an eye.! Don t get to distracted at the end! Lol I made this with red onion lettuce pulled pork tomatoes salsa bbq corn black beans nacho shredded cheese sour cream and guacamole! Everyone loved it. Was pretty easy and something different for our house. Left over stuff made wraps for school/Work and also quesadillas!",

I have not made these yet but I am a Southern California woman who has been living in Europe for the last 30 years -- the last twenty of them in Sweden with my Swedish husband. Through longing and necessity I have learned to prepare masses of varieties of (So Cal) Mexican Food. We live in a beautiful small town on the east coast which is located only one-hour away from Stockholm Sweden's capital. In any case I have always loved Mexican salads served in these sorts of tortilla bowls which are impossible to find in Sweden. Not only that the ONLY kind of tortillas available to me are flour tortillas. You have just blessed my life enormously! Thank you from the top to the bottom of my heart! Also since this is clearly a fan letter I follow \"Food Wishes\" nearly religiously. Love your puns and sense of humor and especially how you make recipes so accessible to the common cook.",
