I liked it with the polenta, my college age son skipped the polenta and just had the meat. My vegetarian hubby just ate the polenta. For once, something for everyone. Before making it, however, I had to research Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche. Had no idea what is was. Midwest born and raised, I found out that it is a bit like sour cream but holds up better when cooking. It isn't stocked in my local grocery store, so I made my own by mixing one cup heavy whipping cream with one tablespoon yogurt (per one cooking discussion can also use buttermilk or even lemon juice). I then let it sit unrefrigerated for 24 hours. Since Chef John is a chef, maybe he gets his  cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche at a speciality store or supplier, but this worked for me. In researching it, apparently  cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is not sold much in the states because (allegedly) laws requiring pasteurization of dairy products.",

I was in search of a recipe to use up my pork shoulder that wasn't pulled pork- this was so good! The part that was the most involved was browning the pork as I did it in batches due to size of my Dutch oven. Used creme fraiche (got at trader joes). Served over homemade mashed potatoes. Amazing recipe! THANKS CHEF!",

                "reviewBody": "I made this tonight followed the recipe exactly. It was devoured! I did double the recipe because we had a 3 lb. pork roast. Hubby went crazy over it. Fresh sage is a must! I served it over mashed potatoes with a side of mixed vegetables and some crusty bread for sopping up the sauce. It's relatively easy to make however I did find I had to cook my pork over 2 hours to get it tender enough so take that into consideration (I had a pork sirloin roast maybe that was why?) Next time I might increase the sauce 50% or maybe even double it because it really needed just a little more sauce (I think hubby might have been a sauce hog haha). Even my picky toddler grandson inhaled it. Watch the salt though it shouldn't need any additional salt because you add it to the meat before cooking and also to help sweat the onions and that's plenty - also use low sodium chicken broth! I would highly recommend watching his video first before you make it the first time. You will not be unhappy with this recipe. I would also advise sticking to the recipe exactly the first time because you will see it doesn't need any changes. It will definitely be one of our favorites from now on. I could not find creme fraiche so I made it. It does take 24 hours so if you can't find it make it the day before. Whip together 1 cup heavy cream 1 to 1 1/2 - tablespoons buttermilk. Let it sit 12 hrs. room temp lightly covered and then refrigerate 12 hrs. before using. (will keep for 10 days in the frige).",

I serve with the Chef John's polenta recipe also found on this site or on Foodwishes.com as well and make my own Creme Fraiche a couple days before also using Chef John's technique (pint whipping cream 3 Tbsp Butermilk or plain active yogurt stir - 24 hrs lightly covered at room temp then 24 sealed in the fridge - viola Creme Fraiche) I love how Chef John's recipes rarely need any tweeking - perfect - every time. Try this and I doubt you'll regret it. While I go to the trouble to make my own creme fraiche I am sure sour cream would be just as lovely and in a pinch even plain whipping cream but it would lack that tiny tartness that the creme fraiche has... still with all the other flavours and the fact that this is a stew I doubt it would be missed much)",
