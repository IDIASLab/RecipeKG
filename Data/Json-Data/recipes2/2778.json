Only things I changed were,  adding fresh mushrooms,  salt and pepper while Browning the meat and onions in the skillet. I also finished all remaining ingredients and rest of cooking in a crock pot.  Meat was so tender and the sauce had a wonderful flavor.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Sorry I don't have a picture,  family got into it several times before it was able to get to the table. I will definitely be making this again!  Yum:)",
