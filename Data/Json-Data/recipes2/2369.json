Had put the cooked chicken cooked pasta grapes and green onions in a bowl with every intention to make that night. However I ended up going to bed early. The next night I mixed the cole slaw & mayo ( I omitted miracle whip-instead added extra 1/4 cup mayo and 1/2 tbsp of lawry's seasoning) and added the mayo mixture to the cold pasta then added cranberries & pecans. It looked so yummy I decided to eat some then and it was delicious! However I made this for the next day and as the recipe suggest I let it marinate overnight the next day it was a let down! The flavors just \"fell flat\". I would suggest prepping the salad chilling overnight then adding the dressing! Also make sure you add the cranberries right before serving as they will turn your salad a grayish color.",

Since I think Miracle Whip is incredibly gross I made my own creamy dressing with mayo sour cream dijon mustard honey garlic fig vinegar and bit of worcestershire sauce; limited celery and diced it rather than sliced so it wasn't so overpowering; I also used half the grapes indicated; and toasted the cashews. it was fabulous.",

I used a rotisserie chicken for ease. I love recipes like this very flavorful and looks great too!",

I used pecans because that was what I had on hand (I think cashews may have worked better with the flavor combo of this recipe).

I used \"Eating Right Light Poppyseed and Caramelized Onion\" salad dressing instead of the coleslaw dressing since I use this with the green salad I make and stock up on it when on special. It is very figure friendly although you'd never guess it was! I don't keep Miracle Whip on hand and since the dressing is plenty sweet i just added light mayo to the right consistency. And if you want to be really decadent add a little crisp bacon (freshly fried and drained) and a little goat cheese!!! Serve on a bead of greens and you've gone to heaven!
