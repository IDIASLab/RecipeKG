I've been trying out various healthy breakfasts for years now (chia seed pudding, overnight oats, etc) and this recipe tops them all. It's high-protein, has tons of fiber, almost no fat (depending on the yogurt you use), and is low calorie. And for how fast it is to prepare and how full you'll feel after eating it...it's just perfect. Great start to your day. Apologies if this is coming off cheesy - I just can't stress how excited I was to find this recipe. My favorite combination is to use just plain Greek yogurt, a cold gala apple (the coldness really does taste fresher!), a handful of frozen blueberries, and some Honey Almond Kashi Go cereal. It's even better with granola, but I'm digging the Kashi for now. But srsly: give.this.recipe.a.go. SO good. Thanks for sharing, Chef John!",
