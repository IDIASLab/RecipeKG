So tasty so easy to make and the little kids could have a complete breakfast in one little muffin. I used silver cupcake liners to make them easier to hold and for them to transport on their trip home and have as little snacks in the car.",

That being said I do appreciate the concept and would make them for a morning tailgate or brunch event where you would like eaters to be able to \"grab and go\" and eat without need for utensils. I made as is though I did choose to season the egg filling with sea salt and white pepper. For us I think a lighter flakier buttery base like tuned croissants would have been more palatable. These are definitely worth trying out for yourself!",
