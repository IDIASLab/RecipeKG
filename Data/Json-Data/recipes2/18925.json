I bought a cornbread mix a couple of weeks ago and realized i needed to do something with it and thought well chili would work, and thus i stumbled onto this. I doubled most all the veggies since i am a veggie.  it made enough left-overs for my boyfriend and I to enjoy for three days! (he even had chili dogs, since he is a meat eatter.) I used chedder cheese, chopped green onions, and even sour cream as toppings! this is a regular for me now!",
