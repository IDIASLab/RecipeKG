This is an easy appetizer to prepare the day before, except for the assembly. The cream cheese mixture is actually better after about 8 hours. Feel free to experiment with the dressing; we prefer the buttermilk dressing but ranch or Italian works great, too. Also, cocktail bread can be substituted for the hand-cut bread, which will save 10 to 15 minutes.",

I made a recipe and a half of the cream cheese mixture hoping it would work for 48 quarters of bread but it was way too much. I'm using the leftovers for a nice veggie dip and big veggie sandwichs (it is delicious with roasted red peppers). Will make again! Thanks!",

Also I didn't have whipped cream cheese with chives so I used some fresh finely chopped green onions. And I forgot the fresh dill...however sandwiches were a hit and there was nothing left over!
