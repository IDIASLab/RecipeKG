I didn't have any garlic cheese spread so I melted a block of cream cheese (8 oz.) and added garlic powder to it. It's probably cheaper than a garlic cheese spread when you just buy generic cream cheese anyway. I also only had one can of green chiles so I threw that in and also added some hot taco sauce and some salsa to kick it up a little. Last but not least I added half a packet of taco seasoning. This was excellent! Thanks for the idea!!!",
