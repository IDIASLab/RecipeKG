I went with what I had on hand that had to be used up: vanilla soy milk and vanilla Greek yogurt. For me no additional sweeteners were needed probably after adding those. I didn't want to add the peaches in case I didn't like this so in their place I added a few tblsp of dried cherries. I did add the optional pecans and chia seeds. I heated it and also added a little non-dairy creamer. Half of this was plenty for me so more for later! The peaches would be good here; many possibilities for other add-ins as the author suggests. Very filling nutritious and saves time! UPDATE 1/15/16: Used mixed berry yogurt and it worked well here.",

Instead of mixing everything together I layered the bottom with yogurt added the oats then added milk until the oats looked almost covered then put the fruit on top.
