Being vegan I used a vegan aged raw cashew cheese which made this dish a fully raw vegan dish which was nice. I make a sugar free fat free maple mustard vinaigrette that is to die for that was really nice atop this stack as well. My husband also had trouble deciding how to dig into this as the previous reviewer mentioned. He picked it up and bit (LOL). I cut into it with a very sharp knife and fork but fully expected it to collapse like Jenga (it did). But it still tasted nice.",
