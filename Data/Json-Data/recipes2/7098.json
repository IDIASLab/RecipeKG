I recommend soaking the rice noodles in warm water for 15 minutes and then adding them directly into the chicken and chipotle mix so the noodles have some of the flavor. Adding noodles into the chicken mix to cook is also a great solution if your spice mix ended up too spicy.",

It turned out to be an amazing combination.  I also loved the simple fact that it is a one pot (ok, two because of the noodles) meal.  It was easy to make and easy to clean up. This is a keeper.",
