I added diced ham and some seasonings to the eggs (sage, red pepper flakes, brown sugar, margarim and ground pepper). I will cook the bacon and sausage until mostly done then add the hashbrowns. It doesn't say it in the recipe so I mixed the cooked eggs and the meat and hashbrown mixture together. I would also not put so much gravy on the crust. I used mozzerella, gouda and white cheddar for the cheese. Everyone really loved the crescent roll crust. I was told to add this to the regular rotation.",
