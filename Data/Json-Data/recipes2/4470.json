My family generally doesn't like \"egg bake\" type dishes because they are dry and flavorless...this one was neither!! The fresh herbs and the chicken broth gave it excellent flavor! Next time I would cut back a bit on the broth and add 1 more egg--I had to cook it another 10 mins and let it sit and \"set\" before serving. It was rich and creamy--everyone went back for seconds--my step-mother said it was better than my step-sisters not that she would ever tell her that.:)",

I added extra cheese and cooked it 10 extra minutes under foil to let it firm up. The fresh herbs were a hit and the fact that it was creamy and not loaded down with heavy meats (pork- sausage bacon and ham). It is a large recipe. I'm making it for Christmas breakfast tomorrow!",
