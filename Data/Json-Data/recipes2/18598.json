I scaled the recipe down to 5 servings which was plenty for the 3 of them to \"test\" it out. Although some of the ingredients are very sweet there is also peanut butter and milk which adds to their protein intake. I agree it is a wonderful idea to help younger hands develop better small motor skills and have fun at the same time! Their little hands got somewhat sticky from playing and eating this but they didn't mind washing up when they were done. This recipe is a Great idea!",
