I have removed the onion that is traditionally found in a Greek salad as it does not complement the addition of mangoes. You can use your favorite Greek salad recipe as well just leave out the onion and add the mango. Goes very well served along with grilled chicken, grilled vegetables, and rice.",

I love the healthfulness of it. I might try white balsamic next time.The recipe portions are pretty big so I cut it down to a 1/3. It still made a pretty good sized bowl full.

If you love mango and avocado and balsamic vinegar you'll love this! Since baby cucumbers are in season I opted for those and they added a great crunch with the peppers among the softer ingredients. 6 stars if I could! Thanks for a great recipe Wayne.",
