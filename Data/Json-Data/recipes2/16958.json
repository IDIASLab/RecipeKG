I used 3 cloves of garlic, minced and instead of green pepper added 4 cups broccoli flowerettes and 1 1/2 cups pea pods. I tripled the mushrooms, and I sliced an onion to add to the stir fry, and put chopped green onion over the dish before serving. I added 1 tsp of corn starch to the reserved juice, which slightly thickened it. Served over jasmine rice, this was delicious (not too salty - the extra vegetables and the chicken broth likely helped).",

I backed off on the marinade by half and that sure worked  better for me than the full amount would have.  Still, the amount of soy sauce was enough to color the vegetables as well as somewhat obscure the flavor of them, and there was still enough of the vinegar for it to impart a slight, but unpleasant,  tang.  I included the ginger, even tho' I typically don't care for it, but believed I could tolerate it if I reduced the amount indicated in the recipe. That, too, was unpleasant.  The ginger should add just a hint of its flavor, not announce itself boldly.  A little soy sauce, a little mirin, and a little garlic and I would have liked this dish far better.",
