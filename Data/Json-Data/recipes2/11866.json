The meat stays moist it is easy to put together and quite straightforward cooking time is right on and it's full of nutrients. Additionally the goat cheese and habanero filling is a nice touch. I don't understand why it is so bland. I used all the ingredients except mushroom each in their written amounts. I enjoyed the vegetable/meat ratio seeing that we try to eat very little meat but even the taste of the fresh veggies (not being saut\u00e9ed first gave them a crisp flavour but a perfect texture) but it needed some pizzazz. I think next time I'll add some Sriracha or similar in the mix to give it a bit more of a kick. Definitely worth trying just add some fresh herbs or more punch when mixing the meat.",
