If it \u201cpours\u201d you didn\u2019t beat it long enough. ?  I made several and they freeze nice. Make a bunch a head of time and keep in the freezer for parties and potlucks when you don\u2019t have time to make anything\u2026 try putting a carton of fresh raspberries on top before serving for an added kick.
