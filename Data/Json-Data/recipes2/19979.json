First of all I did use all of the Olive Oil plus I added 3 T. of Red Wine Vinegar, garlic powder and 3T of sugar.  Once I added the sugar that was  La Difference!  Viva!  It made all the difference in the world.  The dressing was so good that you could have lapped up the remaining dressing in the bottom of the bowel with some warm buttered French or Italian Bread and made a meal on that alone!  Try it with the sugar.  Its sensational.",

I added more oregano (doubled the dressing portions) used mediterranian feta, no olives, and red wine vinegar. Now the red wine vinegar gave it the missing zip in my opinion. This may change the healthiness but if I live on this stuff, I am sure it will be great eating vegees regularly! Pita bread is a must w/my Greek salads too! (my next quest~to find a lowfat recipe!)
