I am not a chili fan mainly because I don t like kidney beans but my husband loves chili and had been saying he wanted to make some so I told him to find a recipe without kidney beans. He found this and we are both hooked! We subbed in a can of chick peas for 1 can of black beans and enjoyed with sour cream guacamole shredded cheddar cheese and chopped green onions along with some fresh bread. Loved it!! Hats off to Betsy for a great recipe - I now love chili!!",

I use 2 lbs of First Cut top round finely cubed and browned meat in 2 or 3 TBLSPS OF EXTRA VIRGN LIGHT OLIVE OIL, & I buy 2 packs of Mild Chili seasoning, & a large can of crushed tomatoes. Meanwhile I use two large cans of Bushes Best black beans, & 1 small can of Bushes Best Seasoned black beans, in a large pan with enough water to keep from sticking. Bring to a boil, add the meat, and reduce heat to medium low.  Simmer , stirring & adding water until all is tender. I add the crushed tomatoes in the last 20 minutes or so. Serve hot in bowls top with extra sharp yellow cheddar cheese. Enjoy!!",
