Of course we cut way back on the portions and timing is everything when you do it this way. Potatoes would have to be cooked first and so on. This is an excellent dish for anytime of the year but an even better one in the summer when you and your friends can just kick back and really enjoy this fabulous feast! Great Star!!!!",

On a trip back to my home state I loaded up a cooler full of the seafood straight out of the fish markets and drove straight back only stopping to refill the ice. The next day I invited a big group of friends out to a lake ( close enough!) and followed these directions. Fantastic! The seaweed I dragged all the way from Maine was novel enough to make the whole excursion!",
