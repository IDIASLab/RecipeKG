First, you really do  need to drain the ricotta, and I prefer whole milk for the richness.  Powdered sugar is a must, also.  But I don't like the citron, so here's where mine really veers off the beaten path.  I add vanilla powder, a spoonful or two of mascarpone cheese, a splash of really good dark rum, chopped dried cherries (tart is my preference), and chopped toasted almonds.  I drizzle my cannoli shells with dark chocolate and let that set, and then fill the shells with my ricotta mixture.  It's certainly not traditional, but in my family, these reign supreme.",
