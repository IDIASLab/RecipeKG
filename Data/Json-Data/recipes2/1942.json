Cubes of fragrantly spiced pork are slowly cooked in lard until they're crispy on the outside while at the same time remaining soft and succulent inside. Bust some up on a warm tortilla, drizzle with braising liquid, top with a little salsa, onion, and cilantro, and you're probably enjoying the world's best taco.",

NO.\" The cinnamon totally wrecked this for us; b4 the broiling stage, my husband actually removed about half of the meat and rinsed it off under running water b4 returning it to a separate pan to broil on its own w/ bbq sauce. I decided to try to recipe as it was written by CJ, but my nostrils and my house were already permeating w/ the overwhelming scent of cinnamon that I had a feeling I was in for disappointment. W/ enough cilantro, salsa and colorful taco-toppings, the meal was salvaged for my daughter and I, but like I said, my husband had already separated, de-cinnamoned, and doctored his own pork. I did everything as written, and the method I will absolutely recreate for a pork butt again, but will not be using cinnamon. Oh, I also want to add that the directions never mentioned shredding, so we left ours in the 2\" cubes, which did fall apart nicely anyways, but b/c the hunks were so large, there wasn't enough surface area to get crispy when broiling, so I would shred the pork after straining as well.",

Although the orange is okay, I think the cinnamon leaves a bad taste to the meat.  I was very happy with the way both batches cooked.  Both were juicy, tender and crispy.

The orange peel ended up disintegrating the first time I made it, and, though I tried really hard not to get any pith, it gave it a sort of bitter taste.  The lime juice goes really well and doesn't overpower it.  I think I cut back on the cinnamon a little bit, too.\n\nI usually serve it with fajita stuffs - flash fried green peppers and onions with a tiny bit of seasoning in a warm tortilla, and sometimes over cilantro lime rice.",

Just ridiculous, melty, flavorful, makes your house smell amazing pork goodness. This is absolutely delicious. The cinnamon and Chinese 5-spice does not overwhelm, it boosts the pork flavor like I\u2019ve never experienced before. I had a 7.6 lb pork butt, bone in, and it took me a minute to cut it all up and I could have gone a wee bit smaller on the chunk size. I doubled the recipe to account for the amount of pork and had to split it between a 9x13 and an 8x8, but even just eyeballing it, it worked out spectacularly. My husband tried it and closed his eyes while chewing, it was so good (a la Remy in Ratatouille). Don\u2019t be afraid, make it just like it says. Watch the video. You won\u2019t be sorry.
