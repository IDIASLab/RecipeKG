The cream tomato paste and curry powder was a great combination. But this was my first time eating kidneys and I don't think I will be getting them again. They tasted & smelled even after cooking like the outside of an animal. I'm not sure if anything can be done about that. I have eaten half of them because the sauce was so good but I had to eat them slowly and at first I wasn't sure I'd be able.",
