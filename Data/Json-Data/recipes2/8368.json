My husband said these were light and fluffy pancakes the first time I made them. It must be the extra baking powder, or the butter instead of oil in the mix. Two pancakes per serving here, but a pancake stack is three or more! We use a brand of syrup that is made without high fructose corn syrup. Syrup is important!",

The buttermilk in this recipe was regular low-fat all mixed Minnesota buttermilk. I recall in some areas of the U.S. there is thin buttermilk with butter chunks in it and it never worked right for me when I cooked with it (and I could never drink it). And all vanilla is not the same. The types of products used when trying a recipe make a difference. ---------------------- I am the author of this recipe. This is a reprint of my recipe. The original recipe page had my photograph. This page did not have my photograph and it was so long ago I had to download from my old recipe page. I now eat gluten free and dairy free. I have done many versions of pancakes with my diet restrictions. All are based on my original recipe here.",
