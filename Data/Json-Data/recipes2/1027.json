We originally adjusted recipe to amount of steak we were doing but hubby still had to cut it in half again & had plenty to marinate in. I did think the soy sauce was a little dominating & made it salty for my preference so we'll cut that back just a tad for next time. I suppose since we marinated overnight could be why it seemed salty to me. We decided a serving for one will be enough marinade for one pound of steak. If that doesn't work we'll adjust accordingly.",
