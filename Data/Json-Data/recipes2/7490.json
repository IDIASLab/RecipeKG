Maybe next time we will up the amount of blueberries from what I already used which was 2 cups (1 cup blended and 1 cup whole). I also added about 1/4 cup powdered sugar just before churning to up the sugar content. Maybe upping the honey to a 1/4 cup and not using the powdered sugar would be just right.",
