The only change I really made to the recipe was cooking the rice in chicken broth instead of water and cooking all the tomatoes instead of leaving half raw. Also, because I used seasoned salt, I left out the additional salt. I was surprised by how good this was. Don't skip the cilantro and tortilla strips. They added a great flavor and texture to it.
