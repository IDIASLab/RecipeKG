To the broth I added 1 celery stick cut into big chunks so I could remove it easily salt 2 crushed cloves garlic 10 peppercorns a bay leaf some dried thyme and the juice of one lemon. I omitted the peas and onions because I had none. At the end of cooking I strained the broth and thickened it to use as gravy. As is I have to give it four stars because it needed a little something extra but with the added ingredients it's a 5. Many thanks to Cindy to providing this recipe!",
