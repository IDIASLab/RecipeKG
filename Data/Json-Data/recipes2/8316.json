I didn\u2019t think there would be anyway I would love this style of shrimp cocktail better than the  other kind I had been eating all of my life but boy, was I wrong!  I couldn\u2019t find any clam juice anywhere, so I had to use Clamato. It was spicy so I omitted the cayenne pepper, and I added a little garlic salt that had parsley in it in addition to the parsley (because we are garlic lovers). Everything else I followed to a T.  I made a huge bowl of it, thinking it would last but it was gone in 24 hours with just 3 of us eating it for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  This is easily my favorite recipe I have found in years. Not to mention that aside from the ketchup, it is a pretty darn healthy meal (and snack) for anytime of the day. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",
