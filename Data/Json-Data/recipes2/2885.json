Also we like things spicy and tomato-y so I used 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes (original w/ green chilis) which was a few more ounces than called for in the recipe. I was afraid a \"no-bake\" recipe wouldn't be that great. However it turned out wonderfully. Hubby could not get enough and raved about how good it was. He also asked to add this to the regular rotation. I think the ingredients here (minus the noodles) would make a good base for a Mexican chili. I'm going to try subbing out the noodles with various beans and see if I can make it work. Try this recipe. You wont' regret it!",
