I also used lower fat cream cheese instead of fat free and used \"Egg Beaters\" for the egg. (I think fat free cream cheese would negatively effect the consistency too much. It helps to beat the ingredients very thouroughly! This is a riccotta recipe, it is a \"grainy\" cheese which will show up in the texture of the final product.) I also added 1/4 cup lime juice and the jest of two limes to the batter. As we are low carb people, I used sugar free wafer cookies, pecans and Splenda to make the crust. Will definitely make this again and again. Highly recommended!",

So I used lowfat cream cheese and sour cream for this, same amount.  I added a few tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and lemon zest of one lemon.  You MUST I repeat MUST put all ingredients into a blender or food processor and pulse for a few seconds to smooth the ricotta.  I let all the ingredients set in the refrigerator for a few ours as well to get more flavor and I followed the advice of one reviewer and made a crust of sugarless nilla cookies crushed and splenda and crushed almonds for the crust, I mixed with melted trans fat free margarine and packed into the bottom of the pie plate before pouring in filling.  Very good!!  Try it!!",

                "reviewBody": "I recommend a change in formula. Why use ricotta? In the 1960's it was possible to get a \"smooth\" cottage cheese and I used to make a very simlar cake with that which everybody loved. I've discovered that you can smooth out cottage cheese with curds if you have a good strong blender. So I recommend this: use a quart container of cottage cheese 1 cup of low fat sour cream or Greek yoghurt 3 egg whites 1/2 cup granulated Splenda and either lemon zest or vanilla to flavor it. You can add the tablespoon of flour or not as you prefer. It does help the cake stiffen a bit better. Blend all the ingredients thoroughly in a blender and pour the batter into a deep pie plate and bake. When the cake is close to being done at about 45 minutes you can add a topping of 1 cup of sour cream stirred up with 2T Splenda which you spread carefully over the semi-soft cake with a spatula returning the cake to the oven for another 15 - 20 minutes. The sour cream topping is very nice and some people might want to double the layer and bake it an extra half hour. Personally I prefer cheesecake without a crust so I haven't experimented with how to make one without carbs. We would rate our own low fat low carb cheesecake as five stars.",
