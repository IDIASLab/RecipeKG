        "description": "This is my take on a healthy, protein-packed, energy-filled peanut butter ball. We all know nuts and seeds are nutritious, but getting them into your diet can be hard when eating them raw doesn't appeal. Here they add a lovely crunchy texture and complement the strong peanut butter taste. This is a great low-carb snack between meals or to satisfy an after-dinner sweet tooth. Make sure you use an all-natural peanut butter with no additives.",
