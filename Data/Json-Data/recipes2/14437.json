We use Rotini instead of spaghetti and specifically Barilla Plus Rotini.  Really adds to the protein and fiber and is much easier for us to eat.\n2.We also use Light Zesty Italian dressing to eliminate 2/3 of the calories from the salad dressing.\n3. We use real crumbled bacon rather than frying it ourselves.  I use 1 cup. (When my wife makes the recipe she uses pepperoni...I almost always volunteer to make it)\n4.  Finally, I use three tomatoes rather than two.\n\nWe hope you find these modifications useful in your enjoyment of this wonderful pasta salad.",

I used bacon and hickory farms beef stick instead of all bacon because I didn't have enough bacon. I still didn't have enough meat so I added in some chunked up hickory farms cheeses. I used sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh in case people were nervous about eating fresh tomatoes due to the salmonella problems. I did find the Superme salad mix but doubt I used a full 1/4 cup of it. I got a bottle of a tuscan dressing at trader joes and the salad really only need one 8 ounce bottle IMHO. I dressed the salad with half let it refrigerate over nite and then added the rest just before serving time. No parmesan since I had chucnk of cheese in it.",
