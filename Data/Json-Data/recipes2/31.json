We added about a tablespoon of spicy mustard which helps with the flavor. We also used asparagus as a side dish and covered that with the sour/cream mayo onion cheese mixture and loved that combo. Now we are down to about 30 lbs of Halibut to try other recipes. Will keep you posted on the others.",
