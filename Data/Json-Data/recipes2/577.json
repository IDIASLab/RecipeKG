My regular blender didn't work well for 1/2 recipe. I also screwed up by adding the full amount of pasta water instead of cutting it in 1/2. Still I think it would be wise to double the pesto for the amount of pasta this calls for. The pesto was good but once combined with the pasta it seemed lost. I liked the cashews and cranberry combination a little sweet and salty - a favorite of mine. I may try again with these changes and try with zoodles (zucchini noodles) for fun and lower carbs although Barilla is my favorite go-to pasta.",
