On a chicken sandwich or wrap a sauce for crab cakes perhaps or on a Po boy sandwich this would be much more appropriate. On a classic All American Burger however nothing beats ketchup and/or mustard. Note: I prepared this exactly as written in order to provide an accurate representation for myself of what it was supposed to taste like. I found it a little heavy on the yellow mustard and if there were to be a next time (probably not) I would eliminate it altogether.",
