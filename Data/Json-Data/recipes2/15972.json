I don't have any children but less the sharp objects I think it would be easy for them to make. I don't have proper deep frying equipment or I am sure it would be faster. This recipe is awesome and tastes great!!! Thanks.",

Great as written if you have a sauce to dip it in but if not I recommend adding some dry rub to your chicken to give it more flavor. The possibilities of this recipe are endless and I just might try it with shrimp next time. Thanks for sharing LOVE2COOK2!",
