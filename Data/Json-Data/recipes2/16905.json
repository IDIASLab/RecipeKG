Used a 10 oz. bag of kettle chips which were well crushed and pressed into the mayo as suggested by another reader. We tripled the Wasabi powder plused used Wasabi paste for added flavor. It was NOT spicy hot. The bake time was longer than 20 minutes. It reheated very well in the microwave at 50% power for a short time. The only thing lost in reheating was the crunchiness of the chips but the moistness and flavor was still there. Definately a 5 star recipe.",

First you lay the slab of salmon in a baking pan then pour YOSHIDA sauce (found at Costco) or any teriyaki sauce till it fills the bottom of the pan. Then spread the wasabi-mayo over the entire slab of salmon. Then sprinkle the Japanese seaweed/sesame seasoning \"Furikake\" over it. Then bake! I think this variation will have a more Asian kick to it... and also more flavor cuz of the Teriyaki sauce!",
