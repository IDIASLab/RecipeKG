The mixture was more than wet enough and I didnt need any of the reserved juice.  I used 1/2 cup of crushed crackers in the mix, I found that only 1/3 of 2/3 cup, as the recipe indicated, was not enough.  Refrigerating the patties before cooking really helped hold them together.  Other changes: dijon mustard for the dry, dried parsley for fresh.  I added about 1/4 tsp dried dill also.  For the salmon I used pink boneless/skinless canned salmon.  I served these with the Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties posted on this site.  Delicious!",

I began by sauteing some baby bella mushrooms in butter and balsamic vinegar. When it came to the actual patties I, like many others, did not use the 3/4 cup liquid from the salmon.  In fact, I didn't use canned salmon at all. I had grilled some salmon in butter and onions two nights before  and had some left over. I just picked this apart and used as much as the recipe looked like it could use.  I also added a little more than 1/3 cup of the crackers. (I used buttery Ritz crackers and they worked great.) I also chose to add some dill and lemon pepperto the pattie mixture and instead of the butter or shortening, I substituted olive oil. (I saved the butter for the mushrooms and the sauce.)  Finally, I made the lemon sauce for salmon patties from this sight like so many others suggested. This sauce made the meal. I will admit that the patties probably would have been a bit dry without it. I put down a bed of the mushrooms, set a pattie on top and then topped the pattie with a generous tablespoon of the sauce. I finished the presentation with a swirl of the sauce around the pattie on the plate to make it look like it belonged on a menu in some upscale restaurant.  It looked amazing and had a taste to match.  I will make this over and over again.",

I will *definitely* try and find BONELESS canned salmon next time.  That was a bit tedious trying to remove all the stubborn bones...and just a tad gross.  I used other reviewers recommendations and used LEMON JUICE instead of the canned juice--added OLD BAY seasoning [but will add more next time]--added some cayenne pepper--and fried in OLIVE OIL & BUTTER.  I also refrigerated these for an hour or two before I fried them so they'd be easier to handle and stay together.",

I used just a splash of salmon juice even though I doubled the recipe and 2 1/2 cups of ritz cracker crumbs.    They were a little soft to handle but they fried up perfect.  Very delicous.  UPDATE:  I made these again and this time I didn't feel like making a mess with coating the patties in the crackers so I just mixed all the crackers right in with the salmon.  It was just as good and a lot easier.",
