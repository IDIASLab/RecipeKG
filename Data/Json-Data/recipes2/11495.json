I added a splash of red wine and some garlic powder which brought the flavor up to what I was looking for in today\u2019s dinner.  Bangers & mash traditionally is served with sliced onion gravy, so I sliced rather chopped the onions and did not put the gravy into the blender to puree it.  This turned out well with the couple tweaks I made.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it.",
