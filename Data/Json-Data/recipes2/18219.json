This recipe has become a Xmas cookie favorite in our home; I just made it for the third time. The flavors of orange and chocolate and 'nuttiness' are comforting and classy. Some things I've adjusted: -I sometimes roll them into 'fingers' and then dip them kinda fun for presentation. - I always have issues with using the chocolate chips and reccomend quliaty semi-sweet or dark baking chocolate instead. - Toast the pecans first for a richer flavour - Squish the dough balls down they're better if they're a wee bit thinner - A add a bit of orange zest right into the melted chocolate and a splash of orange liquor into the dough Thanks for a fantastic recipe!",
