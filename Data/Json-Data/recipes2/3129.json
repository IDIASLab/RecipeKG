I also like the way you use the whole piece of meat and roll up.  I would cut it up into 3 pieces and makes smaller rollups which is so much work. and I use toothpicks..my mother also made a saltine cracker stuffing (crushed crackers, chopped onions, 1 egg, Kellogg's corn flake crumbs, and milk) rollup along with the pickle ones. Thanks for posting and the idea of rolling up in one piece!",

I followed the recipe exactly right up to the point where you would return the rolls to the pan with the gravy to simmer on the stove until done. Since I was cooking 8 fairly large rolls I put them in a roaster, poured the gravy over them (I made enough to cover them almost completely), covered the roster with foil, and baked at 350 degrees for 90 minutes. When they were done I skimmed the grease (there was a lot), put the gravy back in the pan I browned them in, and thickened it with a little slurry of flour and beef broth. The ONLY thing I might change next time is maybe going with thinner dill spears our cutting it down to 2 per roll. I will without a doubt be making this again!",

The only differences in how we make it are: 1) After browning the rolls we place in a 350 oven for 1 hour. 2) To make gravy we add baked drippings with mixed flour/water until it thickens stirring constantly. I also don't believe we've ever used paprika. So good! I also frequently make some with chicken for non-beef eaters. It is almost impossible to get it thin enough but the flavor is on point!",
