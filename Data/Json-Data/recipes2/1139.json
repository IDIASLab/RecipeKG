What a hoot!  Going to get my shiv out of the dish washer and get busy!  Will rate the finished product later. Thanks, Chef John, for making my afternoon with this cute video!!\n\nUpdate April 22\nMade this last night and boy, it was good!  I made only very minor changes to the recipe based on what I had on hand.  I used 80/20 ground chuck even though the video recommended 85/15.  I omitted the parsley because I forgot to get it at the store.  I used a major brand fine Italian bread crumb because that's what I had on hand.   Used jarred minced garlic and (OMG!!) had to use \"fake\" (pre-packaged) Parmesan.  I also used a major brand jarred mushroom spaghetti sauce.  I accidentally let the temp get to 165 before taking it out of the oven.  No worries.  It was still very moist and just delicious.  My hubby, unaware of the \"Italian meatball inspired\" comment on the video, said...it was like a giant, yummy meatball\".  With the very fine bread crumbs, I was not able to squeeze ANY milk out.  They soaked it all up.  This made alot for the two if us.  I've taken half of the leftovers and put them in the freezer using my vacuum sealer.  Hubby had a meatloaf sandwich for lunch today and said that it was even better left over.  The rest of the lefties will be supper in the next night or two.  This is good stuff.",

This was moist, and tasty.  The sauteed onions gave it extra flavor, and allowing the breadcrumbs (I used panko) to absorb the milk was probably the secret to the moistness.\n\nHubby wasn't as happy with it as I was -- probably because he likes his meat cooked well done and dry.",
