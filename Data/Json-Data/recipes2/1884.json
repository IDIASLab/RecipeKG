I added 1/4 cup of chocolate chips (melted in the microwave) and added the melted chocolate to the cream cheese and sugar mixture prior to beating in the eggs. It added a nice extra flavor. I also found the cooling in the refrigerator only took 3 hours instead of 4. I put the raspberry sauce around the edges and down the sides right before serving instead of directly on top and I lined the top edge with whole fresh raspberries. Overall very tasty!",
