I melted my butterscotch chips in a large bowl and when melted added the rice krispies and then poured and spread into my 9x13 dish. I chilled for 10 minutes but the chill time should be longer so the rice krispies can set/firm up. Otherwise when you are trying to spread the chocolate you get bits of rice krispies mixed in.I chilled over night and pulled out and let sit on the counter for an hour before cutting. These do crumble and fall apart easily, yes, I was able to get a pretty pic of them but I was concerned with the amount of crumble. As for the taste, these are VERY sweet and sugary, so much so that a small amount made me sick to my stomach. They are good, just too sugary for me. I am sure my boys will love them while my daughter will also say they are too much for her too.",
