Charro Beans!  The only difference is she used chopped hot dogs in place of the ham and hers had a rough-chopped bell pepper (both of which I prefer and use as well).  DO NOT skip the chipotles - they MAKE this dish with their smokey goodness.  Will be a good side dish for Chilaquilles on this site and of course as a side for ribs!  I LOVE THIS RECIPE.",

I used 6 strips of bacon 1/2 pound jalepeno sausage cut in 1/4\" slices 1 pound of dried pinto beans 1 poblano pepper 1/2 bunch of cilantro 1 teaspoon cumin  I started the beans in a pot of boiling water for 30 minutes and then transfered them to a crock pot and cooked them all day with the garlic, pepper and cilantro. 30 minutes before the beans were finished I reserved 2 cups and mashed them with a potatoe masher returning them to the crock pot, then added all of the other ingredients and cooked it for the final 30 minutes. Of course I put the cooked bacon in the pot as well even though it does not have that in the recipe. I did not remove the garlic or pepper since they cooked in the crock pot all day and pretty much broke into tiny peices.  The pot of beans was devoured and I am going to have to buy another large crock pot so I can double the recipe next time. This is a great recipe since it gives you all kinds of wiggle room to modify it to what you have on hand and your families taste.",

I cooked the meats and added them to the crockpot and let it all cook overnite. Added some salt & garlic salt the next day and it was ready for lunch. Ate with cornbread (Golden Sweet Cornbread Recipe) and another day mashed them for some burritos. WONDERFUL!",
