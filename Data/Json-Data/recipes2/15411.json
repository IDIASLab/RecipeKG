I alter it a tiny bit - I use less butter (about 4 tablespoons), 1% milk instead of skim, 1 cup of Romano cheese (I really love Romano cheese), and a whole bag of frozen peas ('cause they're good for you!). Oh, and I leave out mushrooms 'cause I don't like them. But this recipe is really great. I find it comes tastier if you use the moist smoked salmon instead of the dry smoked salmon.
