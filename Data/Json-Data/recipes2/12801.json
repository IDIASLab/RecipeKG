I can't say that I really 'measured' anything but I did use less celery and onion than called for and 1/2 of the rosemary as it can be strong for us. Also I wanted to serve this on sandwiches so I did not use the lettuce leaves but I did drizzled the ham salad w/ ranch dressing before serving which gave this a nice extra layer of flavor. I'm used to making my ham salad w/ only ham relish pepper and mayo so this was def a nice change and one I will be making again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
