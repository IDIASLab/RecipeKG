Bit messy to eat.\" In the end I think I'd be OK w/ regular apple slices smeared w/ peanut butter and maybe sprinkled w/ a little granola for crunch but this was still a fun recipe to try. Used a pouch of Larabar's cinnamon \"Renola\" and honey-roasted PB ground at Whole Foods along w/ a chubby Gala. Didn't really measure but I'm sure I hovered around the 1/4 c and 1/2 c called for. My daughter and I agreed that it was a little messy to pick up sandwich-style and eat but as one would expect w/ this ingredient combination the taste was delicious.",
