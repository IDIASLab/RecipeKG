It is quick, easy, forgiving, and has all the pizza flavors my family enjoys. I chose to use sausage, onion, peppers, and Parmesan. I eyed the amount of sauce since everyone I know  who makes pizza doesn't use a measured amount, you just eye it. It is a great quick evening meal. thank you!",

I used a 2qt dish reduced bisquick to 1 2/3c used the same 1c of milk and added 1/4 Parmesan cheese and 2T of italian seasoning to the crust mix. I think the seasoning makes a big difference in the crust! The extra milk keeps it from being too biscuit-like...it's definitely more like a thick crust pizza. Add sauce and toppings of your choice (I used cubed pepperoni and fresh mushrooms) with a ton of cheese and mmmmm that was good! I did not put extra dough on top - used it all on the bottom. My family loved it! My changes will serve 3-4 people.",
