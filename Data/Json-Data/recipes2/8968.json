I would serve it with soft oven baked pretzels. It does pair so well as stated. My only issue with the recipe is the fat to flour ratio in the roux is a bit off. I compensated by straining the gravy once but that was a bit nessy. I suggest upping the fat a bit to make a smooth paste before adding the liquids. My only change was not finding cheese curds and using 4oz German beer cheese. Using Johnsonville Beer Brats and McCormick reduced sodium brown gravy as pork gravy was not available. That all worked fine. Ty",
