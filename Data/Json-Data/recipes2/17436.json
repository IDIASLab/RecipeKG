I'm not a big fan of frying food so next time I will lessen the oil called for and just saute until done. Really a good flavor even if you don't have enough time to marinate for the full 4 hours. I will definitely make again. Thank you!",

I would make sure not to use a really thick teriyaki sauce nor one that is too sweet.
