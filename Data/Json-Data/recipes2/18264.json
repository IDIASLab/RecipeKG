When I was ready for the party, I inverted it onto a large plate, topped with the rasberry jam (I thought it would be prettier and easier to eat this way) that I surrounded with Wheat Thin crackers.

I added a package of cream cheese used a couple shakes each of cayenne and garlic powder and molded into a ball which I rolled in chopped pecans and covered with seedless raspberry jam. I think strawberry jam may go better with this dish but that's me. I also think this is much better on Ritz type crackers than Wheat Thins. Looks very fancy with minimal work and tastes fabulous! Update: I have since made this ball with red plum jam and I think it to be MUCH better than the raspberry and you can usually find a generic.",

I did make the following adjustments: Add 1 block of cream cheese (I whip a room temperature block in the bowl prior to adding any other ingredients), in addition to cayenne and garlic salt, I also added onion powder, paprika and garlic powder (about 1/2 tsp of each.  I mix the seasoning into the cream cheese before adding the remaining ingredients).  I use a combination of sharp and mild cheddar cheeses (50/50 of each) and I make this dip the night before to allow the flavors to blend.  I also recommend using a 8\" springform pan (lined and sprayed with butter flavored Pam) instead of the jello ring. Once the dip is turned out on a plate, top with raspberry preserves, chopped pecans and fresh raspberries.  It tastes great and looks fantastic!  By using a springform pan, you can get the dip and preserves in each bit...which is really yummy.  This is very simple to make and tastes great!",
