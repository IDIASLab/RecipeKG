I have not prepared asparagus in the microwave so I was interested to see how this would work. I set the timer for 3 minutes and it was a little long for us because it was past the \"toothy\" stage. 5 minutes would have caused it to disintegrate I believe. There were no problems with the lack of a vent in the plastic wrap. As a matter of fact it worked quite well and as soon as the dish hit room air the asparagus looked like it had been shrink-wrapped. Nice touch to add hazel nuts but I feel walnuts would have worked just as well. This was a tasty salad. Thanks!",
