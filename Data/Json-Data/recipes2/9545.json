Really didn t measure anything and they were very good and very easy. That lime juice really brightens and enhances the flavor of the sprouts. You won t need a recipe in the future this is waaaaay easy. mommyluvs2cook excellent recipe thanks for sharing.",

Added the lime juice and salt and pepper but it just seemed to need something more.  I served this as a side dish for a Mexican themed dinner - maybe some more spices might have helped?  The little crunchy parts were good though.  :)  Thanks!",
