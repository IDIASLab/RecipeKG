I added more stuffing because it thickened the soup a little and also gave it more flavor. It is good by itself or over egg noodles which is what I did. I will definitely make this again and it s a excellent way to use your Thanksgiving leftovers.",

I didn't cook the onion as there was enough onion flavour in the stock and stuffing. Used canned tomatoes and dried parsley. Nice hearty soup with good turkey flavour. Put the noodles in but the soup could stand alone without the extra starch item.",
