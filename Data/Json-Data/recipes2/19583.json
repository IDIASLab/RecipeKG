I ran out of mayo so I used heavy cream instead. To make the mixture more stable and not fall apart when placed on the pan, I reduced the flour by half and substituted the other half with cornstarch; these were combined straight into the mixture instead of rolling the mixture on them. I had to set the mixture aside for 5-10 minutes in the fridge to allow the ingredients to bind together, and just before frying I added around 1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs to add a bit more crunch to it. Turned out great.",
