I use all cornbread no other bread, for broth I used the stock made with the neck from turkey.  I also recomend cooking your cornbread (Jiff) 5-10 min longer than recomended.  This does two things one it gets a denser crust on the edges adding some great texture and two it dries better allowing for more absorbsion from drippings and the initiall mixing enhancing the flavor.  You will not go wrong with this recipe.",

I did not alter the ingredients in this recipe at all. First, I cooked the chopped onions and chopped celery slowly (on med-low heat)by itself in a little bit of melted butter until all of it was tender soft.  Then, I cooked my sausage in a separate skillet(I used Jimmy Dean - Pork Sausage). Next, I combined them in a big bowl and put them in the refrigerator to let the flavors blend. Several hours later, when it was closer to our dinner time, I warmed up this mixture in the microwave. I added the rest of the ingredients exactly like the recipe called for, and then baked it.  Very Yummy! I had so many wonderful comments. This will definitely be our annual Thanksgiving stuffing recipe! It turned out perfect!",

Also cook your cornbread a few days ahead of time, wrap tightly and store in the fridge.  It dries out which is good for making stuffing :)  Also, bread crumbs are to fine. I get a bag of dried bread chunks or toast old bread (white/wheat combo is fine) and add.  I also only use one onion, about 1/2 cup celery and 1/2 cup green pepper and I don't cook it with the sausage. it goes into the stuffing mix raw and cooks in the oven. Finish off the mix with seasoning salt and fresh ground black pepper...the mixed peppercorns are great. add enough broth or water til sticky, but not drippy wet. Also if you are running short on time or don't like all the chopping, omit all the veggie chopping and use chicken broth with herb seasoning. College in makes a good variety.",

I start off by baking a small pan of cornbread by mixing one cup each of cornmeal and flour with 2 tsp. baking powder, and water.    Once cooled, the cornbread is crumbled into a large mixing bowl along with the sauteed onions, chopped bell peppers, and celery.  In addition to the pork sausage, we cook the turkey neck, gizzards, and the turkey heart in a small pot with 3 cups of water.    The cooked meat is removed from the neck bone and chopped along  with the cooked gizzard and heart, all of which is then added to the cornbread mixture.    The remaining broth is added to moisten the stuffing with additional water as needed.",

This looked like a winner, both in prep and ingredients.  I used 2 Jiffy cornbread mixes and had a fair amount leftover; Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Stuffing Mix (I can't imagine our recipe giver Sal meant bread crumbs like Progresso), and just to save a step I took another reviewer's suggestion and used sage sausage, therefore omitting the 1 tsp of sage.  I made the stuffing the day before Thanksgiving, then baked it the day of (I let it sit at room temp for about 20 minutes and then baked it per the regular directions).  This dish was the hit of Thanksgiving dinner, so I decided I better see what all the fuss was about -- I could have eaten the entire pan!  Delish!  It had a little kick to it, don't know if that was from the sage sausage or all the onions, but wow!  I will make this every year from now on!",
