Like others I also used fresh garlic. Once this was done it was great and I got tons of compliments at Easter dinner. I had plenty of leftovers so I cooked 1/2 a pound of bacon cut into pieces removed it from the grease and cooked 1/2 pound of boneless skinless chicken breast cut into pieces in the bacon grease. I mixed the chicken in with the potatoes added a can of mushrooms and topped it all with bacon and a sprinkle of shredded cheddar. I baked it uncovered until it was bubbly all the way through. Fantastic!",
