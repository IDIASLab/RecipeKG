I lived in Seville and the part-time local cook made a much more bold version which becomes quite addictive especially on hot days. This recipe calls for about 2X the garlic and 2x the cucumber. Also no cayenne. I believe a red pepper is better as it will keep the soup red and not brown. Here in the States I buy the Pomi brand chopped tomatoes (excellent low sodium) makes it real easy and they are flavorful. This is the kind of recipe you can experiment to make it to your particular taste. But the basics of this recipe is right and original to Andalusia.",
