The recipe I used had some of the stuffing mix on the bottom (which absorbs some of the liquid) and the rest of the stuffing mix on the top. Cheese then would be mixed with the veggies. Thank you so much for reminding me of this. Also if you microwave the veggies with a little water or steam them they won't be watery.",

My zukes are enormous right now...so saying use 4 chopped is misleading.  Should it be 4 cups?  Do you put the soup mixture over the top or should it all be completely mixed together and then put into the casserole dish.
