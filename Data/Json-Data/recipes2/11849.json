I questioned myself first and then should have listened and gone with my instinct but there is way to much black pepper and dried thyme in the recipe. And it's all we could taste above everything else. They both were totally overwhelming. The thyme sat on the tongue above the flavors while the black pepper did a party in the back of the throat and wasn't fun. My youngest had the most difficulties with this issue and this momma felt horribly bad. I'd ONLY try this again with taking my instinct like I should have done and reduce the black pepper to 1/4 to 1/2 tsp verses 1 1/2tsp total as well as the same with the thyme. I did top the recipe with 1/2cup shredded cheese mixed with 1/4 cup of shredded parm and a sprinkling of home grown dried basil before placing in the oven.",
