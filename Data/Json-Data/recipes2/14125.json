I halved it and combined everything a bit differently...Instead of  mixing it all in the food processor, I Just chopped the beef (that I rinsed and dried) very finely, then mixed it by hand with the cream cheese and dressing. I did make this the night before as suggested. We all really enjoyed the flavor of this and I also enjoyed the simplicity! I will be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",
