Next time I'll reduce the liquid even more. Instead of Sriracha, I used a pinch of Cayenne, despite the fact  I love Sriracha. I then substituted rice wine vinegar w/cider vinegar. Since cider vinegar is far more potent than rice wine vinegar, I cut back on the amount used. Overall the recipe was great as a side to a barbecue sandwich. As usual, allrecipes.com, thanks for turning me onto new taste sensations.",
