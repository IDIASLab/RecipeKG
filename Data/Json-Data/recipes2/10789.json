Omit the syrup as triple sec is already sweet...unless you like girlie/dessert types of drinks. :P I let this marinate for 3 days in the fridge. Add the fresh squeezed lime juice when ready to serve! So much fresher that way. :) This recipe is also quite amazing with ripe mango instead of cucumbers!",

If this doesn t make you feel the summertime fun nothing will. I agree with other reviewers that you need to use at least a half a cucumber in order to taste the cucumber. The jalapeno gives it a fun little kick but they are superb even without the jalapeno except they go down a little too smooth and a little too fast. Thank you daddyyumyum for sharing your outstanding recipe! (P.S. Simple syrup is easy to make just follow the recipe for Simple Syrup here on allrecipes.)",
