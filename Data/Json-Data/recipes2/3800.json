I made this with 2% milk regular chocolate syrup and Starbucks peppermint hot chocolate because those are the ingredients that I had on hand (I wouldn't recommend buying Starbucks hot chocolate for this because it is expensive and I only used it because it was a gift and I haven't been drinking it). I also didn't have cold coffee on hand so I used the frozen coffee that I kept in ice trays for my other recipe and blended everything together in my magic bullet it was great! I'll be making this from now on. Also I think that it tastes better if you brew fresh coffee to melt the hot chocolate in rather than just heating up old coffee but make sure that you get the hot chocolate dissolved either way because if you don't it will leave random dry chocolate particles in your coffee.",
