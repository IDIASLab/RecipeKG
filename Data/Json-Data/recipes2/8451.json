I liked that the recipe did not have to even be flipped adding to the ease while busy. I made a few changes based on what I could find at the store. I could not find the specific seasoning. So, I used an equal amount of Italian seasoning and added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and a very small pinch of salt. The store I went to did not have any small packs of chicken breasts left. I went with thin cut turkey cutlets. It was about a 1 lb package and it worked perfect. They almost sort of tasted like a pork chop. I would recommend trying this poultry also. I was able to to bread six pieces and line them up with space on a baking sheet. I lined my sheet with foil and sprayed with cooking spray and there was no real issues with sticking. I will definitely make this again. It was flavorful, the meat was tender, and the coating was nice and crunchy. Ty",

Next time I will use some of my favorite Papa's Seasoning from this site before dipping into the butter. Other than that this recipe was declared by the two of us as a total winner! My husband \"stole\" some of my chicken and that tells me that he meant it when he said it was a 5! EDIT 11/13/16 I was one of those who bought the huge bag from Costco of the crispy onion rings. So I added some of those to this recipe tonight and think it was a very tasty addition. If you have any left from that (awful but traditional) green bean casserole just use it here!:)",
