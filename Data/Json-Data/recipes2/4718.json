I made my own almond flour by simply grinding almonds in a blender. My first batch burned on the outside before they were even cooked inside. On batch two I turned down the oven from 350\u00b0 to 300\u00b0 and they cooked throughout, perfectly in 30 minutes. I allowed them to cool and they tasted so good with a little powdered sugar dusted on top. I used pine nuts instead of walnuts-it's all I had on me. Definitely use some sort of nuts, they made this even better. Thank you michelle taylor for sharing this recipe!",

The coconut oil flavor was noticeable, so keep that in mind if you are not a fan of coconut. I used honey because I didn't have agave and they turned out with just the right amount of  sweetness. I added chocolate chips instead of nuts and loved the addition.",

I couldn't put my hands on my almond flour so I used toasted hazelnut flour but otherwise followed the recipe except I  reduced the baking temp based on Buckwheat Queen's review. Since mine turned out really well, I would recommend sticking to her method. Using the hazelnut flour, they are reminiscent of Nutella which the son loves.  I will make them again and play with different nut flours, too. It's a great base. I also think they would be good with a handful of chocolate chips sprinkled on top before baking.",

Brownies rose to about 1 1/2 inches. I also cooked my brownies on 300F degrees for 33 minutes. I used refined coconut oil because I don't like  the coconut flavor that unrefined coconut oil has. The flavor is very rich, soooo good!\nAlso, the texture of these brownies is a bit greasy and very moist. I might try to lower the  amount of coconut oil the next time I bake these.",

I had no agave nectar so used an abbreviated amount of brown sugar only just a bit more than 1/3 cup. I baked them with a few dark chocolate chips on top then when I took them out spread the softened chips over the top like frosting. Oh how delightful they were. I think they will be the only brownies I ever make!!!!",
