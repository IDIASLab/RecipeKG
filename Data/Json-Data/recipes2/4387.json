                "reviewBody": "It breaks my heart to give a bad review of a recipe someone took the time to post. But even though I followed the recipe (which took me closer to 40 minutes with the chopping and shredding) and rather than \"cakes\" I got \"mush\". The \"heat\" in this recipe comes from \"spicy mayonnaise\"... for which no recipe is given. I used a spicy mayo recipe I found elsewhere on the web but the \"heat\" disappeared in the mix. The \"bunch of sliced green onions\" turned out to be 2 cups worth. The same with the parsley. Once I mixed everything together the mixture was on the runny-side but I though it might gel in the 'fridge. But when it came time to cook them the cakes began to fall apart on my spatula so I lifted them by hand and reformed them in the pan. I cooked them in two batches of 6 letting them cook a little longer on the first side hoping for some cohesion. It didn't work. The end result resembles a crab-like stew with flavors that overpower the subtle flavor of crab. I plan to add the mix to a salad or maybe a pasta dish. Were I to try this again I'd increase the crab to 16 or 18 oz. add another egg and some flour use just 1 c. sliced scallions and 1 c. chopped parsley. I'd also use regular mayo and add chili and/or cayenne and Tobasco sauce until the flavor reaches \"spicy\" and I wouldn't bother with the black beans. Unless something is missing from what's posted here this recipe (unfortunately) doesn't make crab cakes worth the price of the crab.",
