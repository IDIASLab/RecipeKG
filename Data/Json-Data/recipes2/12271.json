Because I left off the tomato (I would have loved the tomato by the way) I gave the sandwich a sprinkle of paprika for some color. My mom always sprinkled that on her deviled eggs so I thought why not? This was really good. If you are like me and you like vinegary-y things you will love this. For the hot sauce I used Sriracha because it is thicker and I was going for a Sriracha mayo flavor. Excellent!",

I used English Muffin Bread (what I had on hand) and skipped the tomato slices (personal preference). But I could see removing the pulp from a tasty summer tomato stuffing it with this egg salad and just skipping the bread. I gave this an extra shake of Tabasco and used Popa s Pickled Eggs from this site. Phoebe thanks for sharing your recipe it s good.",
