So I searched high and low for a great recipe that would taste authentic and this is it! However I made some few additions: - I skipped out on the mint and opted for a mix of herbs instead. A friend got me a bag of salad herbs straight from Crete ( mix of dried mint thyme and oregano ). I added this to the cheese mixture and it was amazing. - I also added the nutmeg which gave it that authentic Greek cuisine flavour. Other than that the recipe is perfect and now it's become one of my favourite things to make in the kitchen! I made a whole batch and stored them in the freezer...they were gone within 2 days between my boyfriend and I!",
