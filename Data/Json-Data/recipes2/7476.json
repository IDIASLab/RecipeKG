Don't expect the taste and texture of store-baked, processed, full of sugar and fat muffins. But for what they are (gluten free, low carb) these muffins are amazing.\n\nYou can replace honey with stevia. And banana with pumpkin puree or other type of mashed veggie or fruit similar to a banana. I even pureed a zucchini instead of a banana. Next time, I'm gonna try mashed beats. But half a can of pumpkin puree works best, if you need a substitute.\n\nThe best taste is making the original recipe as is (banana, 2 spoons of honey). And it's awesome!\n\nMy best variation so far: 3 cups of almond flour, 3 eggs, 2 spoons of honey, half a can of pumpkin puree, the rest of the ingredients as listed in the original recipe. Makes about 12 medium muffins.",
