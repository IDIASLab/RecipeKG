It's also great if you have a vegetarian living with you...make one batch of this and it's lunch for a week. My mom commented that it's just like one of the salads sold at Whole Foods only this doesn't cost 8/lb. I use Roma tomatoes rather than cherry tomatoes because they maintain their shape a bit better...and a word on couscous...make sure you check the outside of the box about how much one box makes. If you use Far East brand you have to use 2 boxes instead of one. Two chopped red bell peppers seem to go over better than mixed ones. I also put in a larger container of feta. If your grocery store doesn't have greek salad dressing in a bottle mix together 1/3c each of olive oil and balsamic vinegar and that works too. When not making this for a party I serve this as the side dish sometimes with \"Cousin Cosmo's Greek Chicken \" also on this site. We call it Greek Night and my 3 kids LOVE Greek Night!",
