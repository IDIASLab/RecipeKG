The creamed spinach was delish and I think I could make myself a huge bowl of that stuff and the b\u00e9arnaise was wonderful I'd never made it before ate it but never made it and it was quite simple. I over did the steak a little but hubby likes it that way. And said it was just fine. These were perfect in every way. Will make again for sure. Making these earned me a huge kiss on the cheek and coffee served to me after dinner instead of me making it myself. What a reward! Thanks Doug.",
