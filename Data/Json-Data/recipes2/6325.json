I did add a bit of extra adobo sauce to the burger mix and instead of banana peppers I used some canned mixed hot peppers to the onion mix. I wasn't convinced the spicy and blue cheese would be a hit but it definitely was great. We cooked these a little rare and I didn't use quite as much blue cheese. Oh and made them into 8 patties - they would have been huge otherwise.",
