My assumption from you \"seriously?\" is that you've never made these.  So why give a review at all?  If the recipe doesn't appeal to you...simply move on to the next.",

That way I figured one each to try if they were good we had one more if not then I wouldn't feel bad throwing them out. Let's just say everyone wished I had made more! They were so good. One thing I did extra was broil them on each side after baking for the first 25 minutes. I can't stand soggy bacon this way the peppers got nice and soft from baking and the bacon was nice and crisp from the extra step.",
