I cooked for 5 minutes turned the chicken over and cooked 5 more minutes. Then removed the covering and turned over again and cooked another 5 minutes. I took the cover off for the last 5 minutes to make the sauce thicker. This turned out great in taste and looks!! I also made another recipe from this site called \"Italian Chicken\". It was good too. But the Loga's Microwave Chicken was better. It was more tender faster and much less mess and tending too. Gosh I will surely be making this time and time again!! I even took a picture of it...need to try to figure out how to add the picture to the site. Thank you for this reicpe! Oh..also..my husband that claims he isn't that crazy about curry...he loved it!

I have tried it twice now once with only 1 leg scaling the recipe to just 1 serving. I was totally shocked that it actually tasted ok. But since I scaled it down so much my ketchup mixture burnt. So I decided to give it another try with 2 legs and more of the ketchup/curry mixture. I'm new to curry so I did use a lot less than called for and since I was only doing 2 legs I cooked it 6 minutes - stopping after 4 to let it rest and continuing on for 2 more minutes. Leaving it to rest & continue cooking outside of the microwave. It's my belief that for this to work you really need to know your microwave & be comfortable cooking in it. If you have an older one it probably doesn't cook as fast & if you have a newer one (like mine) it can cook the heck out of stuff. This is extremely easy economical and really quite good.",

I've made this a couple times now and found that even with a newer microwave 15 minutes doesn't come close to getting the chicken to a safe temperature. Also needed a few things to jazz it up I added a little salt and garlic powder as well as a bit of chicken stock because the first time I made this the sauce burned while the chicken barely cooked. Also cooking it at a lower setting for longer resulted in a better overall dish (I did about 25-30 minutes at 70%). One addition that was fun was adding and mixing in a can of rinsed pinto beans with about 5 minutes left which resulted in what was basically bbq beans.",
