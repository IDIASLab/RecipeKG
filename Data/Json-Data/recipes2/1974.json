We left out the mushrooms due to one child's issue with them and midway into folding in the peas, I stopped when it looked like too much for us, and only added 3/4 of a cup. That was plenty. The one suggestion I might give the next person is, instead of sprinkling the all-purpose flour over the mixture in one of the steps. Reserve a 1/4 cup of the vegetable broth and make a slurry with the 3 TBSPs of flour. The ease of doing that will allow you to avoid clumpy flour bits when the directions tell you to sprinkle it over the mixture. I always tend to have that happen and avoid it as much as possible so that the mixture is smooth. Flour does not sprinkle well at all. Avoiding this will have better results in your dish in the long run. But other then that. I will make this again because it was just flavorful and comforting as a wholesome dish for my family. 10 stars if I could rate it that high.",

I used No Yolks Dumpling noodles since the store was out of the No Yolks extra wide egg noodles and they worked I think for the better- it didn't come out mushy.\n I did cook the noodles first and set aside even though it was not stated in recipe.  I also stirred the  flour into 1/4 cup of the vegetable broth (room temp is fine) until smooth then added this slurry to the mixture when called for. You should always do this to avoid clumpy lumpy flour! The ingredients for the topping was not specified- for those who would like to know it's the melted butter mixed with the panko bread crumbs :) Also, instead of frozen peas- I used frozen mixed vegetables since that's what I had and I added 3 cans of tuna. Everything else I made as is....DELICIOUS!",

Used 4 oz of cream cheese instead of the recommended 8 oz cube.  I also used 1/2 cup of reduced fat sour cream. I let it bubble for about 8-10 minutes after this step. I didn't used that much shredded cheese, maybe 1/2 cup instead of recommended 1 cup.  My Panko crumbs were rancid, so I used herbed  breadcrumbs , but barely dusted the top.  Cooked 18 minutes and left the casserole in the oven after it was turned off 10 minutes. \nThis step made it actually look and taste like casserole. \nIt was delicious! Will make again and again.",

My husband said it was a pretty good base recipe, but suggested additives afterward. I totally agree with him.\nAlso, I used 3 cans of tuna instead of just 2 although this recipe could use 4 if you want to really enjoy the tuna aspect. Perhaps next time I'll sub sour cream for the cream cheese, use 1/3cup bread crumbs, and also to with grated parmesan cheese! Mangiare!",

I adore peas and thought the amount was just fine, but my daughter thought there were too many.  Too bad, I am the cook, I get to decide how many peas go into my tuna casserole.  This is plain comfort food, so don't expect a culinary masterpiece.  You should expect a wave of nostalgia, contented family members, happy cats who get the tuna juice, and a full stomach.  Best made and served on a cold winter's evening in New England, but I'll eat it anywhere.  Thank you for posting.",
