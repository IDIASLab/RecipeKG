I put the milk into a pie plate and the pie plate into another dish that I filled with boiling water. I placed this into a 375 oven for about an hour. Then continued with the recipe. I also blended the mixture because otherwise there would have been lumps. It is delicious and only took an hour and 15 minutes (total) to make instead of the almost 5 hours it states on here.",

The top layer of the milk did nearly burn after an hour but it was easily removed. I used 1/4 rum for one can of milk to adjust it to my tastes...IT'S SO GOOD. I hesitated to use the original method of browning the milk simply because the can has a label saying 'Do Not Heat in Can.' I've been told this pertains to using on a fire but it was easier and FASTER to go with the oven method anyway. I do not like the taste of alcohol so add the rum slowly until you have the taste you want. The full amount would be too much for 'light' drinkers.",

I didn't want to go out and the only alcohol I had on New Years Eve was about a 1/3 of a bottle of Amber Brandy but I did have a can of sweetened condensed milk. I was skeptical (and a little scared) but it worked wonderfully. I peeled off the paper and boiled the can in a 3 qt. covered Farberware pan covered with water for 2 hrs and 45 mins. It was perfect. It did take some mixing to combine the brandy with the caramel. Very smooth. Looking forward to trying it again with spiced rum also in my coffee. Happy New Year!",
