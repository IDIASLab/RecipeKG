We liked this for our butter cream egg recipe, but were slightly disappointed with the somewhat cream cheese flavor in them, which you don't find with most butter cream eggs.  I personally like them, but will probably try a different recipe next time that doesn't call for cream cheese (or not as much of it) for butter cream.",
