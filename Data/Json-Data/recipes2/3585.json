I used fresh strawberries instead of preserves about 3/4 of a pint. blended them up with all the rest of the ingredients. I used Italian dressing on hand so I used that instead of the Russian. Also I used a whole packet of the dry onion soup mix. Also I only used one very large chicken breast a large red bell pepper and some red potatoes to make it an all in one meal. It fit in a 9 x 9 and would feed 4. just cooked till the potatoes were done. oh delicious!",
