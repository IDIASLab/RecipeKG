I always make as directed the first time otherwise why use the recipe in the first place (unless of course I don't have all the right ingredients on hand). To make it a bit thinner just added a bit more liquid and to make it a bit spicier added a bit more curry to taste. This recipe is perfect for my children to eat the way that it is (not spicy and thick enough to keep the mess down).",
