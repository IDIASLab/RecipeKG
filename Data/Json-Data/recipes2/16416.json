I say that only because they are fried in oil and butter. I think this recipe would be much better if fried in a pan instead of baked. Healthier baked but they were to dry for me.

When i served these to him last weekend he told me that he was never eating seafood outside my house at a restaurant again! My family and i loved them also. I did make a few changes though... Used tinned red salmon (i know! fresh is better but salmon in Australia at the moment is more that 30 per kilo) i didnt use red bell papper because i dont like the taste( used red onion instead and i used jarred jalepeno(cant get fresh here). They were still amazing! Also served with Tartare Sauce I from this site... also amazing! Thanks Bubba",

I once had some Crab Jalapeno Bites at Phillips Seafood that were phenomenal and I've thought of them ever since - these were just like them! I followed the recipe exactly (even measured) but didn't have whole wheat bread crumbs or chives so I used italian crumbs and red onion. I baked at 400 for 30-35 min based on other reviews which seemed perfect. Next time I would chop the shrimp to marble-size chunks (bigger than I did) to add variety to the texture. I like making this with leftover salmon and frozen cocktail/salad shrimp as a shortcut. A nice chopper (like Pampered Chef) also makes this very quick and easy.",
