I also added in some vegetarian hotdogs before I baked it to make a vegetarian main dish.  My husband loved it hot and took it cold for leftovers the next day which is something I'm always looking for in a recipe.  I sprinkled it with some paprika once it was done to make it pretty, too - ha.  \nIt was easy and comforting on a cold day and since I have the other half of my cabbage left, I might just be making again in the near future.  \nThanks for a great recipe!",
