When I was frying the onions, I added hot peppers and cayenne pepper to give it some kick.  After the soup was fully blended and cooked,I also added in pieces of cooked potato.  The potato adds some hardiness to the soup, and makes it much more filling---while maintaining the great curry and zucchini flavor.",

Just a note for all those out there who are not veteran soup makers,  be careful when you go to blend it in a blender, let the soup cool for a bit, the steam plus the blending of the soup when it is still hot will blow the lid off the blender...
