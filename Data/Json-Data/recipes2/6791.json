Spread nuts out evenly on large microwave safe plate and toast 1 minute at a time stirring at those intervals until a nice toasty smell develops 2-5 minutes. Check often as microwaves differ of course. Also if the nuts seem too crowded toast in more than one batch.)",

I didn't have parmesian cheese so I subbed pecorino romano and it worked out fine. The recipe is silent as to which kind of olive oil to use-- I decided not to use EVOO in favor of lighter olive oil. This pesto has a lovely delicate flavor that my family enjoyed served with crispy gnocchi. Glad to have a delicious affordable alternative to pinenuts. Thank you grettagirl for the delicious recipe.",
