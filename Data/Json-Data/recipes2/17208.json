Taking out about 25% of the milk is best if you are not draining the creamed corn. It's enough bacon but a few extra slices never hurt anyone:) and don't be afraid to overcook it. You are going to want that firm bite. I cooked this for ages you really can't overcook it as long as your poking it every 10 minutes or so after the first hour. Thanks for posting this recipe it's really fun to play with and customize.",
