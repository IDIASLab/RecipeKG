I'm a big blue cheese lover so this was the perfect salad for me. In the future I'm planning on making a few modifications for those of us who don't like blue cheese such as: -Intead of blue cheese dressing use Thousand Island Dressing. (A creamy kind.) and I plan to replace the cheese with crumbled feta. Also for all the blue cheese lovers I would recommend using crumbled blue cheese. Thanks for sharing!:)",

Also I have always added fruit to my salads for some reason---I love the pineapple or canned peaches and Ranch combo and that might be an aquired taste too. (:",
