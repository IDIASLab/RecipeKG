Some of mine were too big to fit into the pocket I pushed into the cinnamon roll. There's no 'pretty' way to seal the cinnamon rolls together without ruining the look of the cinnamon roll. I ended up simply placing the top cinnamon roll on the bottom and hoping for the best. Family had no complaints! Assembled the night before and made for a Monday morning breakfast. Happy Family!",
