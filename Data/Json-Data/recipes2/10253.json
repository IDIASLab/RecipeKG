The flakiness of the puff pastry, the crispy corned beef hash and the bite of the Swiss cheese marry perfectly with an egg cooked on top that melts its yolk over the entire concoction to help bring everything together. The sriracha sauce is a must on this dish! It is an eggs best friend and shouldn't be skipped. Try this one out for your Sunday brunch, you won't regret it.",
