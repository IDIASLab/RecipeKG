It's a very flexible recipe (I used a red bell rather then green and tossed in some extra stray frozen veggies from half-empty bags) and the little bit of mustard adds a great flavor to the Italian dressing. The longest part of the whole thing was cooking the bacon which gives you an idea how quick this throws together. The only thing I might've changed would be to season my turkey a little more as it was cooking or maybe cut it in to even smaller pieces before putting it in the salad to soak up more flavor. This recipe will definitely get pulled out again when the unused frozen veggies and leftovers start to add up!",
