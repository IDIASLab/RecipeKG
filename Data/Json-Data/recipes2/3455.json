After reading how many felt it lacked flavor I just made a minor change.  I added dry oregano and thyme to the onions and potatoes before adding any stock. And, since my husband is not a fan of lemon I only used half the amount.  I used boneless chicken breasts and followed the directions for that regarding timing etc. however, my vegetables were cut to the size of the original  recipe and that was a mistake.  Next time I will cut them into smaller bite size pieces so they finish the same time as the chicken.  I might also, put some bread crumbs on the chicken for a bit more crust.  Very easy and will definitely make again.",
