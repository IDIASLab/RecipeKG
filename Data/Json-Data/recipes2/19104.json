I also accidentally added the yolk of the egg but I'm not worried about cholesterol or calories so I figured it couldn't hurt. It turned out pretty well although I had trouble keeping it all in one piece in the pan and had to keep squishing it back together. It was soft and moist not dry but had a similar texture to my mom's salmon patties only better. It tasted nothing like beef but I don't mind at all.",
