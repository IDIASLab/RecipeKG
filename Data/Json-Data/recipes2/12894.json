They took much more chocolate to coat than the recipe calls for and were not a clean ball as illustrated. The White chocolate gets muddied with the cookie balls so I had to melt the chocolate in small batches. In the end I didn't even bother to decorate them because it was just too long a process. A disappointing endeavour. UPDATE: January 2016-my son decided he loved these so I made another attempt. Using suggestions by others I stuck a toothpick in each ball which I formed after rubbing my hands in veg oil so the muck didn't stick. Then I dipped them in the White chocolate and there was minimal transfer and they actually didn't look too bad. Keeping the balls well chilled helped and I set the chocolate in a hot water bath to keep it liquid. He loves the flavour so he got the whole batch to share with his work friends.",

I froze them a bit longer and only took half out of the freezer at a time. I also kept the chocolate in smaller batches to keep it \"clean\". Finally, I used a toothpick in the ball to use for dipping. It's easy enough to fix that small spot with either more frosting or decoration than if you are using your hands to dip these.",

Then the remaining pellets by hand. That took time. I oiled my hands so forming the dough with the mixture w/softened cream cheese was fine but time consuming. I must not have an ounce of patience!! Then comes the nightmare. I used white baking chocolate like the recipe says. I did not have a Pyrex bowl so used a small measuring cup and heated small batches of chocolate. The chocolate seemed to take an eternity to melt. Then applying the chocolate to the frozen balls was nuts!! Tried two forks a toothpick a spoon. It is all in the timing. This is a very messy recipe & might be okay once you figure out what works best and the timing. The chocolate turns to glue quickly. You have to work really fast. Maybe Almond Bark would work better. I knew going into this it might be a fiasco but never dreamed it would be this bad. Ain t nobody got time for this!! Or if you do you are a Saint. This recipe was exhausting. I was looking for something no bake because my oven is broken. Next time I will do something with Jello. Merry Christmas signed The Grumpy Grinch.",
