The pecans add a nice texture as well as taste. Inexpensive and on hand ingredients make it a regular from now on.",

I love the taste of curry in tuna so I increased the tuna to 1/4 tsp. Only had walnuts on hand so I toasted and chopped those instead of pecans. I tried the tuna warmed as directed on Ritz crackers and it was terrific but I actually enjoyed it later in the day on toast with melted provolone green onion and tomato. With the sweet pineapple savory curry and crunchy walnuts this is a nice and unusual take on standard tuna-salad. Oh and a little shake of S&P doesn't hurt either.",
