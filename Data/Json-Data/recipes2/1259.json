Use good orange juice!\" I marinated our pork chops (on the more slender side) for nearly 24 hrs. in the exact ingredients and ratio as Andrew directs. At about 10 min. per side on the grill they were perfectly done and really tasted great; however I'm almost glad that I couldn't detect the rosemary b/c I think that an herb w/ that pronounced of a flavor wouldn't jive so well w/ OJ and soy sauce. In any case we're looking forward to using this marinade on another occasion b/c it was quite good.",

I had actually purchased a rosemary plant a few days before so I was able to use the fresh herb in this recipe. I did marinate them all night. My pork chops were \"bone-in\" and not the thick ones as the recipe stated but the chops were still AMAZING. My next trip to the grocery store will include some thick boneless center cut pork chops! I am looking forward to making these again. Thank You Crystal and Andrew!!",

I chose the recipe - how could I not given Andrew is my baby grandson's name and the fact I had a lonely zestless orange in the fridge I needed to use before I headed out of town again? I marinated the chops; the Grillmaster cooked them over charcoal. Hubs is the one who's not a fan of marinades yet he was more impressed with this than I. He remarked that it was quite good nice balance of flavors with a pleasantly delicate hint of orange. I personally wouldn't have detected any marinade on the chops at all had I not marinated them myself. I guess my tastebuds must have been a little numb tonight. Botton line - if Hubs liked this marinade it must be darned good as he is particularly discriminating.",
