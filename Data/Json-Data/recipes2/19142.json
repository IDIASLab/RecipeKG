I made everything to the specifications and it was SO MUCH food! I have a family of 4 and easily could have cut the recipe in half and still had plenty.

For those of us who live in the States and can't get the Irish bacon sausages and black pudding from our local stores there are some US-based online companies who offer these goods. I can personally recommend Tommy Moloney's I've ordered from them several times and have been very satisfied. It costs a little more than what you'd find at the supermarket because of the shipping but it's worth the splurge every so often. British/Irish rashers (bacon) and sausage are very different from the style we have here. Their bacon is much less fatty than ours. I love it!",
