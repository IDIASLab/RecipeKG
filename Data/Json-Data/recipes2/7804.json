The ONLY thing that was off was the refrigeration time.  A minimum of two hours implies it will be fine in two hours.  I actually had to refrigerate this for 6 hours before it had set enough to be fudge- a disappointment because I had to serve it while it was still spoon-feed material.  Once it hardened though, it was great.",
