My husband loves tres leches and his only complaint was that it was more dense than what he is used to. cake turned out exactly like the picture which I am thrilled about! I am not a fan of sweetened condensed milk or milk in general yet I found myself sneaking pieces of itThe flavor is considerably better a couple days in so i suggest waiting at least a full 24hrs. It's kind of complicated/time consuming compared to traditional recipes for regular cake but I love that it's a blank canvas and you can change flavors fruit and extracts to make it unique.",
