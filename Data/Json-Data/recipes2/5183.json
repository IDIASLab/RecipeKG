I liked the addition of coconut milk and the cinnamon was a nice touch. Very tasty! I felt like the soup was lacking something though. I had to add some salt and freshly ground pepper. The condensed tomato soup left a bit of a bitter and acidic taste. I think letting the soup cook a bit longer would help mellow out the bitterness or even adding a pinch of sugar. Fresh garlic would also work well in this soup or even garlic powder if you're trying to save time. This would also be very good blended. If I make this again I might take my immersion blender to the pot after the soup is cooked. I would probably also use regular coconut milk instead of low-fat. Thanks for the recipe!",
