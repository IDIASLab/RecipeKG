I'm not a huge fan of a giant piece of apple pie...so this is a great recipe change up!! I made some changes to the actual recipe and I liked my version better. I used puff pastry instead of frozen pie crust (easier to work with and the crusts \"puffed\" beautifully). Also instead of using cold butter to make the topping I used melted butter and the crumbles stayed together much better. No major changes. I would highly recommend this recipe!!",
