I also didn't heat them in the olive oil with the basil and garlic.  Instead, let them marinate overnight with the olive oil (only 1 tablespoon), basil, garlic, and I added a splash of balsamic vinegar and some minced kalamata olives.  Spread the feta/cream cheese mixture on the bread, then put it in the oven on the broiler setting for about 2 minutes. Add the tomato mixture with a sprinkle of mozzarella on top, then put back under the broiler for another 2-4 minutes (depending on how crisp you want the bread).  This melted the cheeses perfectly!  It was honestly like having an authentic mini italian pizza.  We're thinking of trying pepperoni with it next time.",

I changed the recipe a bit to fit my tastes but combining the cream cheese and feta was phenomenal! It made for a creamy and zesty spread. I sauteed 3 cloves of garlic and chopped 4 tablespoons of fresh basil 1 chopped roma tomato and spread that on top. That is all it needed--cheese tomato fresh basil and fresh garlic. I reduced the recipe for 1 (just me and my wine) and so only made 4 pieces of bruschetta. I also sliced an italian loaf of bread and broiled it on both sides. I drizzled a lil olive oil over the toasted bread for extra savory flavor. AMAZING! I would not recommend shortcutting to save time. This took me only 10 minutes and the fresh ingredients were well worth the prep. Now....back to the rest of that wine:)",
