At an hour and a half it hadn't quite pulled away from the sides but the center was only barely jiggly and we like it on the gooey side so it was perfect for us.  Note-  I could have gone for a stronger PB flavor, but that's what happens when it is made into dough, maybe I will add chopped PB cups instead of the chocolate chips next time (or both ;-).",
