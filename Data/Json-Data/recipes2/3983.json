I made a double batch but only had one can of green chilies so I diced up a jalape\u00f1o to make up the difference. This is not a low calorie soup so since I was making a double batch I used heavy cream and half and half to make it lower in calories. The flavors in the soup blend and work really well together. My DH and I loved this soup. It hit the spot on a rainy and icy December day!",

Like a few others, I added a can of black beans as well as a half bag of frozen corn and simmered until heated through. Since the husband and daughter like brothy soups, I doubled the chicken broth in addition to using half and half in lieu of the heavy cream. Reheats wonderfully and made a great lunch the next day!

I added 2 cans of various beans (Great Northern and Tri-Bean which is Kidney Black and Pinto mixed together) then I only had 6 oz of cream cheese on hand so I used that and added enough cottage cheese to make up the lack. I cut back on the water by 1/2 a cup and the cream by about a cup because I wanted a thicker consistency. I also added a can of whole corn. Very yummy. Thanks!",
