Powdered sugar to make up for it. I decided I d add a little bit more of the spices and did 1tsp. apple pie spice 1/4 tsp. each of ground cloves ground ginger and ground nutmeg. (I didn t have pumpkin pie spice on hand so I used apple pie spice in its place). Great recipe and everyone loves it. Set out with ginger cookies graham crackers or graham sticks and best of all is to eat with apple wedges! I soaked the apple wedges in a mix of 2 tsp. citric acid (or use juice of one lemon) and 6 c. water for 5 min drain and pat dry with paper towel to keep them from browning.",
