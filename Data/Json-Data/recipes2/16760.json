I served this with popovers this evening and when those were gone I still had the craving for this and made some toast. This is awesome!! I can't decide which I like better...honey butter OR honey butter WITH cinnamon (and sugar). Both delicious and melt in your mouth! Thanks Karena!!",

The sweetness completely overpowered the cinnamon and butter...I'm sure that if I'd used a different honey, the result would have turned out more pleasing to my taste buds.  Personally, I don't recommend using it on waffles or pancakes because it's more of a spread than a syrup.",
