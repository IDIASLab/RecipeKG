We served it over the rice and had slices of fresh baked bread as a side. Delicious meal and super simple! I changed two things: #1 omitted the cayenne. My husband can't handle spicy. #2 put 2lbs skinless bone-in whole chicken thighs instead of 1lb chopped boneless skinless. (I figured the bone made them twice as heavy so I doubled it.) We had to remove the bones after it was done cooking shredding the chicken in the process. I don't think this made a difference taste-wise just ease-wise. Shredding already slow-cooked chicken is way easier (and cleaner) than chopping raw chicken.",

Here too I used chicken breasts instead of the chicken thighs called for. And I was happy. I didn t add the cayenne because I don t like heat in my food and I m glad I chose not to. Between the Cajun seasoning I used and the Cajun andouille sausage I threw in it was really quite hot enough thank you very much. I also added some frozen okra something fairly new to me and I enjoyed it (FYI the frozen was infinitely better looking than the fresh ). I m not sure this was as good prepared in a Crock Pot as it would be in the conventional manner but it sure was good enough! Note: I also didn t use the slow cooker liner and the pot cleaned up quite nicely and with little effort without it.",
