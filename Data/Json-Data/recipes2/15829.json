I didn't have any green bell peppers in the fridge, so I substituted a poblano pepper.  The slightly spicy flavor of the poblano mixed nicely with the cumin, corn, and garlic.  I also used frozen diced hash brown potatoes instead of the red potatoes to save some prep/cooking time (something I do with most recipes that call for potatoes).  The biggest change I made, though, was substituting evaporated skim milk instead of the milk and cream so that it's much lower in fat.  It was still thick and creamy, thanks to the pureed corn.  Oh, and (recipe author, please correct me if I'm wrong), I think there was a typo on the amount of sausage--I think it's supposed to be 14 oz, not 4 oz.  The packs of kielbasa from the store only come in 14 oz packs, so 4 oz would be just a tiny bit.  I used the whole 14 oz and it seemed to be the perfect amount of sausage for the recipe.",

In step 2 - browned kielbasa in same skillet transferred to pot. Mopped up excess grease from skillet with paper towel then deglazed with chicken broth to release the fond then added to pot. I used a bag of diced potatoes which seemed to take a long time to soften. Next time I will use red potatoes the recipe calls for. I also found I needed more chicken broth. I will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!",

Looked through 59 reviews at time of this one and identified changes others had made and then threw in one or two new ones. Used a 15-1/4 ounce can whole kernel sweet corn and a 14-3/4 ounce can cream style sweet corn and placed those directly in soup without pureeing the corn. Subbed 6 oz. evaporated milk for 1/3 cup milk and 1/3 cup heavy cream. Used 14 ounce hardwood smoked turkey kielbasa (4 ounces shown in recipe is likely an error). Added 2 fresh jalapeno peppers thinly sliced 5 stalks chopped celery and 3 chopped carrots to cook with the onion mixture. In the 2nd step added 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning and 1/2 cup fresh finely chopped parsley after stirring in the corn kielbasa and milk. The jalapenos gave this soup some heat but was perfect for us. We super enjoyed this soup and will be among our favorites. Thank you MOLSON7 for sharing and we couldn t have done it without you.",
