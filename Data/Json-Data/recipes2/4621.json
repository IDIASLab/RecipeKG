One batch would have been plenty. They held together much better than I expected but I couldn't flip them worth a darn so there was a plate of patties and a plate of not-patties.  I think I tried to cook too many in the pan at the same time.  We had frozen onion rings on the side and some nice green beans. Tarter sauce was nice on the onion rings but not really needed on the patties, they had great fishy flavor.  I wasn't sure about the pork rinds at first but I'll make this again.",

The mackerel adds great texture, and the raw onions are excellent (I usually saute' them for my salmon burgers because my husband *hates* raw onions, but these really get nicely cooked in the process).  My family was so impressed with these (and they're big fans of my usual salmon burgers -- they said these were even better!).\nThe pork rinds we had were BBQ flavored and fairly spicy, and that really added a nice kick to the overall taste.  Didn't have any parm, so I substituted coconut flour.  Eggs were on the small size, so I used 3.  Texture and stick-togetherness were all great!  Medium high heat was too much for our stove, so I tuned it down to the low side of medium once the pan was good and hot.",
