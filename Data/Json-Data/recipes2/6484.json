So I opened by RB for him to decide. A young teen will not take long to make a decision-last pasta recipe saved first one he tried-This was so good, Maui, the perfect carb supper for our busy day. It was very easy and came together quickly even for the young one. Used garlic chives and a cut up tomato. Do not skimp on the cream, I rarely measure cream when I make pasta,  this is a great amount for a creamy pasta. We used 1/2 whippping cream and 1/2 coffee cream, delicious. The young redneck even took a pic, our camera is bad, but he likes your pasta:) Thanks Maui.",

I could not find pancetta bacon, so I subbed Canadian bacon.  I had 2 c. of heavy cream on hand and 2 c. of half and half \u2013 so I used those.  I know my sauce was a littler thinner than what it should have been, but the taste was still incredible.  Loved the tomatoes and fresh basil (from my herb garden) taste in this dish.  It really did make it taste like a summer meal.  I served this with a simple green salad and multigrain French bread.  We had a wonderful meal and I have a \u201cnew favorite\u201d summer meal.

I changed a few of the ingredients instead of pancetta I accidentally used very thinly sliced cooked ham and 1/2 half and half with 1/2 whipping cream. I also added a clove of garlic and blanched asparagus. It turned out really well and I'll be making it again- using either pancetta or ham. The ham went well with the dish. Thanks for recipe. It was easy to make and very tasty.",
