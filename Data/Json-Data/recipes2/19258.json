I added some pepper italian seasoning and a sprinkle of italian seasoned bread crumbs (I had some I wanted to use up) to the meat. I also topped it with grated parmesan cheese. Oh and I used green bell peppers. It turned out really great! I served it with bread and butter with a bit of garlic salt sprinkled on it. It went really good with it. It was a hit with my Husband I will make this again for sure!",

These freeze extremely well so I made up a few lunch containers that my husband can just \"grab and go!\" Thanks for the recipe!",
