After it was cubed, I softened them a bit so they would be thoroughly cooked. I prepared the eggplant before cooking by putting the cut chunks between salted paper towels to drain the fluid while the chicken cooked. I also added a teaspoon of Italian spice mix, garlic powder, smoked paprika and salt and pepper to taste to the chicken before I cooked it. After I added the eggplant, I added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, cinnamon, graham marsala. I served it as is with some pita bread.\nI will definitely put this on my keeper list. Very tasty and easy.",

I'm an experienced cook and know my way around the kitchen but the prep time was seriously beyond the 15 mins as listed. (From start of prep to final cooking I was just under 2 hours!). The recipe also did not state if I should use canned or fresh sweet potatoes so I opted for fresh. (If I do this dish again I will use canned). Reading another reviewer stating she had done the same I decided to \"soften\" my fresh potatoes as well. (I cubed the potatoes prior to cooking & these became a bit overcooked /\"mushy\"...I suggest boiling for only 7-10 mins.). Decided the overdone potatoes was not a big deal and continued on with the dish. I served this over brown rice. The first bite or two seemed tasty but I thought the tumeric and other spice combinations were very overpowering.",
