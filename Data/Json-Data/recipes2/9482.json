I doubled the ingredients (for four servings) and made it as written except for using curly kale and substituted 1 tbsp dried oregano for the fresh. Sorry but nobody in my family including myself cared for it. The oregano was especially overpowering and the kiwi tasted like very sour lemon. If I ever make this again I think I'd cut the oregano way down and use only half (or less) of the kiwi called for.",

It sounded pretty sketchy but I made it anyway. I didn't have fresh oregano but I had fresh cilantro so I used that with the same measurements. It turned out delicious!! It has a sort of citrus-y taste and the ginger is fantastic. I highly recommend you try this. I tossed some fresh diced mango on top perfect. This will definitely be a new staple side dish.",
