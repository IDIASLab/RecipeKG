It adds to the flavor and a great presentation. I let the asparagus marinate overnight as I like to do as much prep in advance as possible.  I also blanched for longer than one minute...maybe 3 minutes...as my asparagus was not thin.  I didn't serve the balsamic vinegar on the side.  It really didn't need it.  Overall, a healthy, easy low fat recipe.  I'll repeat it again and again.",
