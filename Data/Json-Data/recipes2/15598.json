I did alter the recipe a little and took the advice of some other reviewers and added a touch of sour cream - definitely gave it alot of body and fullness to the flavor. I used Kens' lite ranch which was really good and not as heavy tasting as the regular ranch. I added some taco hot sauce some green peppers canned mexicorn some cheese and I also used a zesty italian dressing for a kick. Additionally I used some cajun seasoning for a bit of warmth and alot of seasonings. It was very funky tasting and it is now on my husbands list of favorite dips....oh and try eating this with ritz crackers - I think it's better than tortilla chips!",

It is a MUST that you make it the night before or at least let it sit in the fridge for 8 hours. It makes all the difference. I also have added an avacado both times and think that that really adds to the flavor. I also add a couple of spoonfuls of sour cream like someone else suggested some diced pickled jalepenos and cut back just a little on the dressings. Last time I served it with Red hot roasted pita chips (pitas cut into wedges sprinkled with spicy spices and toasted in the oven).
