I did some in the oven broiler and some on the grill - either way I ended up pulling them out before the bacon was really crisp - but the fish was done. This is solid recipe - well worth making again. Next time I would make sure to have really thin bacon and I would season the fish with some smoked paprika. Thanks for a great summer recipe.",
