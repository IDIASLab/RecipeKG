        "description": "Oh my god! is my first reaction.  I love chicken saltimbocca but it's something you need to make and eat immediately. I decided to make it an entire day in advance and this was simply amazing. My husband does not like the word meatloaf! However, every time I make him one he loves it, including this recipe. I used all of the ingredients as my chicken saltimbocca but used ground chicken. Enjoy this delicious paleo dish today (or tomorrow). You can make just 1 loaf or up to 4 mini loaves! You pick.",
