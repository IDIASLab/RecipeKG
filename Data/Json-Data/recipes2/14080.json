I guess the prep time (for me) was a little more than what's suggested here but the cooking time was right-on. I did the prep a little ahead of time so that when company came (and we were having drinks) I was able to turn the water on to boil... then toss the chicken in the pant... etc. In short it was a great (easy) dinner to prepare while people were over. The meal itself? Terrifc flavors. Will definitely do this one again. Word to the wise: This is filling - so don't make your servings too big (like I did)... Also my partner thought the chicken was bland. (I didn't...) So keep that in mind when preparing the chicken. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish however - everything about it... the taste as well as the appearance. A",

I also didn't have basil and replaced w/oregano and didn't have parsley and had to leave out. Had I had all of the ingredients I believe this would have been very good! Nonetheless I would definitely add twice the green onion garlic and olive oil it calls for to add more of a robust flavor.",

I added artichokes and substituted grape tomatoes for sundried. since there alot of mediterranean flavors here i marinaded the chicken in greek dressing and Cavender's greek seasoning first. Chicken came out very tasty. To make more of a sauce to coat the noodles i added chicken stock and a small amount of tomato sauce at the end. Great recipe!",

I was orignaly going to take out the olives but at the last second i kept them in. They help with the taste and you can always do what i did put them to the side. Try it see what you think.",
