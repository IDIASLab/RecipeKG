And I don't add the onions too soon so they still retain their crunch. NOTE:: With regards to BLAND potatoes, the TRICK is to add salt n pepper right after you add the potatoes to the pan. It's also the reason you add salt to pasta water, gives them flavor As they COOK and not just on the outside of food.I have learned this the hard way. TRUST ME your days of bland potatoes is Over;)",
