I picked this recipe to prepare it not knowing what else to do with moose meat. My whole family loved it! I did add a raw egg and about 1/3 c. bread crumbs to the moose meat to keep in from coming apart while making meatballs. Excellent recipe and I will make again even if I have to use ground beef. (p.s. for those who do not have moose it tasted really similar to bison/buffalo. I think that would be a easy to access alternative)",
