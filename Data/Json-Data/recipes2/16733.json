I agree that it can be too dense or watery but that's easily fixed by partially baking the buttermilk crust before adding tomatoes and other ingredients. The second time I made this I replaced celery with some sauteed sweet anise (it's much better than it sounds I swear) and I removed the sour cream. I also replaced the green pepper with red bell because I don't like the bitter bite of green peppers. I think this is a good simple recipe.",
