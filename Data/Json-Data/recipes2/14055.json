My kids...well they are really picky and don't like sauce on pasta so they didn't care for it but it has a mild flavor and tastes very cheesey so most kids should really love it. I kept back about 1/2 cup of the cheese and put it on top. I definitely will make this one again.",

Would be easy with the pre-cooked grilled chicken. This would make a good dish for leftover turkey. I also used cavatappi pasta as I couldn't imagine it with spaghetti.

I did not have tomato soup so after i put the cream of mushroom in I put a small amount of ketchup in the can and the rest of it water. And I did not have 2 cups shredded cheese so I used one cup and one cup mozz. cheese. I know that my grandchildren and sister would love it because they love kielbasa sausage along with us. So I suggest you don't try it and give it bad reviews if you do not like it. Thanks Laurie!!!!!",
