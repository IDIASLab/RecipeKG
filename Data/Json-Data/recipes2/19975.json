I did NOT toss the dressing with the salad I served it on the side. I didn't have melba toast I used Texas Toast croutons instead. We enjoyed this salad especially me. I went back for seconds.",

I also used half fat free honey dijon dressing instead of all italian. My advice: throw in as much crumbled melba toast as reasonable- they soak up the dressing and taste soooo good! They add nice texture. Thus was a very easy recipe and i will make it again.",
