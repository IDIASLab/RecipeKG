I used a can (2 cups) of chicken broth instead of 1 cup and cooked it down a bit longer (like 30 minutes) which gave the flavors time to \"meld\" and thickened it up some. Spouse thought it was a tad salty which could have been my fault from using twice as much broth and cooking it down. Next time I'll use low sodium broth and maybe No Salt Added beans. Sprinkled some grated cheddar on top. Good recipe a bit unusual but quick and easy. Will make again with low sodium ingredients.",

May need a little more spices to taste if you're making liquid and bean adjustments. Definitely top with an extra sharp cheddar and some parsley (we also tried cilantro but it was better with parsley believe it or not!).",
