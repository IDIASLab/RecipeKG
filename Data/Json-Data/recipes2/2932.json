He never said a word as he was eating them and when asked admitted he liked the potatoes and didn t even know the Boursin was in there. It then begs the question So why include the Boursin if you can t taste it anyway? Trust me you can taste the Boursin. And it s good. So Hubs just THINKS he doesn t like Boursin. I prepared this as written but did not precisely measure any of the ingredients particularly the amount of buttermilk. I really doubt I used as much as called for. As this recipe s first reviewer I regret having to say I didn t get an immediate yum factor with these. I missed the creaminess and richness that butter provides. So I added the butter and yum.",

Boursin is a very mild, slightly tangy cheese, meaning that the herbs in it won't have the strength to properly complement the potatoes. You're better off buying unseasoned goat cheese and flavoring to your preferences. The buttermilk needs to be cut in half. Overall, the only thing this recipe got right is potatoes.",
