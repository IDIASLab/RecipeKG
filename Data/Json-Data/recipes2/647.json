We used frozen octopus we'd had for some time 2 large regular onions as that was what we had in the house and I just added some chopped greek olives. It was 'out of the park' delicious We served it with whole wheat pasta green salad & crusty panini rolls. So easy so delicious. Left overs the next day were just as scruptious!",

The time it takes is worth it. I deglazed the sauce pan with Brandy after the reduction part which I think adds a little depth of flavor and added a teaspoon of red curry paste because I like everything spicy. I also used just 1 very large onion only because my daughter (11) isn't a big onion fan (yet). Otherwise everything here is absolutely spot on! I served this over pain white rice. This will not disappoint. Thanks again!! Definitely making this again.",
