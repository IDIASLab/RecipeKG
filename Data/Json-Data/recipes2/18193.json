I put the mushrooms & onions in a small food processor, used only 3 eggs, added 1 tbsp sherry, and used combo of romano & gorgonzola. Only add bread crumbs until you have a sticky consistent, not dry. I made large & small balls & they were all very tasty, rest in the freezer.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!",

I added a little more parmesean and used freshly minced garlic instead of the powdered kind. Thank you so much! You just introduced me to one of my favorite recipes.",

A GREAT meatless meatball option nearly as good as my Italian grandma's meatball recipe! I also used crushed up Club crackers 1/2 tsp dried oregano 1/2 tsp dried marjoram 1 tsp dried basil and a pinch of ground red pepper in place of the seasoned bread crumbs. I also reccommend allowing the mixture to rest for 10-15 mintues before shaping into balls to allow it to hydrate though this is not absolutely necessary.",
