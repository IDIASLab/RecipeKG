Rinse, drain and dry (on a towel) pea pods. I pop off the stems & slit open one side with a sharp paring knife.  I mix softened cream cheese with dill and mashed garlic paste.  Fill pastry bag, fitted with a star tip, with the cream cheese mixture. I just pop open the length of the pea pod as I get ready to pipe a scallop of cream cheese into the pea pods.  Beautiful piping looks sufficient as garnish but the peas sounds like a cute idea. If you garnish with peas, I would use fresh, dry peas, so they don't look messy. My method is really quick if you clean your peas in advance. There is no need to soak.  I could whip these out real quick. ",
