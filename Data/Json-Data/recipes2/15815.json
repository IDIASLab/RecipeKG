I usually use a casserole dish to make it and once I have poured the spaghetti sauce on the noodles I take a fork and \"poke\" thru the sauce into the noodles. That way the noodles are not just mixed with egg and cheese but also some sauce. As long as you don't \"mix\" it the layers still stay intact to cut into wedges for serving. This just slightly mixes the casserole so as to not be in such defined layers.",

I used my usual meaty speghetti sauce and it just tasted like spaghetti with a thicker consistancy.Next time i may use a maranara and layer in peperoni to make it taste more like an actual pizza. that said i'll deffinately be making this dish again. i think there are a million things you can do with it.",
