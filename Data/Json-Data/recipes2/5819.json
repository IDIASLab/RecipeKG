We absolutely loved the sauce, though I couldn't for the life of me find the Ponzu Lime, so I just squeezed some fresh lime juice in there and added a dash of Kikkoman soy sauce. The combination of the breaded shrimp with the garlicky, buttery rolls and the super spiciness of the sauce made this sandwich a winner, and one I will be making again! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I love the idea of making the French bread into garlic bread and thought that was a great touch. I followed the directions to a tee and wouldn't change anything except perhaps adding more creole seasoning to the flour mixture and 1-1.5 lbs of shrimp is PLENTY. I was able to find the Ponzu sauce in the Asian section of Safeway but for those that can't it's basically watered down soy sauce with lime and a touch of sugar (as indicated on the ingredients list and this is what it tastes like). I used one loaf of french bread assembled the sandwich and then cut into 4 pieces. Served with cajun fries and it was a big hit!",
