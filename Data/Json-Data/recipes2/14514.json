After filling the muffin cups with dough, I baked the dough by itself for 2 minutes before adding the beef filling.  This made sure the entire bottom was firm and cooked thru.  I added chopped onion, green pepper, garlic, crushed red pepper, worstechire sauce, prepared mustard, honey, and hot sauce.  I mixed the cheese in to the beef mix.  This made it turn out kind of like a sloppy joe.  It tasted great!  Also, I used butter crescent rolls, and the cup was perfect!  This is a winner!",

I made homemade ones using the Never Fail Biscuits recipe also found on this site. I diced up fresh onions and sauted them with the beef instead of the dried onion. Also when the meat was simmering with the bbq sauce I grated some cheese into the mixture. I couldn't wait to taste these as they smelled so yummy all through the cooking process. I still put grated cheese over them even though I added a little into the beef filling. As I stated before they were great! Thanks for the recipe.",

When I was reading the recipe I was thinking that plain ground beef cooked with BBQ sauce needed something more, so here is what I did:\nI melted 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter in a skillet, and browned 2 cloves of minced garlic, and one sweet yellow onion which I had finely chopped.  Seasoned well with kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper, and cooked till the onion was very soft.  I then added about a tablespoon of brown sugar, and let the onion and garlic carmelize a little more.  Added 1 lb. of 90% lean ground sirloin to the onion/garlic, and cooked JUST till no longer pink.  Drained off any excess grease with a spoon (wasn't a lot).  Then added probably more than a cup of my favorite bottled BBQ sauce, and let simmer maybe 10-15 minutes.  Right before spooning the beef into the biscuits I added about 1/2 a cup of grated cheese and mixed it in to the beef mixture.\nUsed 'Grands Flaky Layers' for the biscuits, and a pre-shredded colby/jack blend for the cheese.  Ended up baking them for about 20 minutes total, but they got nice and brown.\nThese would be fantastic for poker night or a superbowl party, as you really can carry them around and eat without any utensils!\n\nI'm thinking that all kinds of combinations would be good....greek seasoned ground turkey topped with feta cheese maybe!",
