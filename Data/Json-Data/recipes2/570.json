I have a little cousin that is a very picky eater and asks alot of questions when he eats things. I was so unsure that he wouldn't like this that I didn't even offer him any.Well he asked to try it and he loved it. My whole family was shocked. Before I went home his mom asked for the recipe. After the dish was gone I still had some ingredients left except for cream cheese. Well my little cousin begged his mom to go to the supermarket and get more cream cheese so I could make more like right away. My family loved this dish and we make it all the time now. The only difference was that we didn't use onions. Oh and once I made them the second time I used regular dinner roll biscuits instead of crescent rolls. I was surprised that the children in my family even loved this dish.",
