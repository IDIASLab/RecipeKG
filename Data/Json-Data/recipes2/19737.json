I love grilled pineapple, and I didn't really think it needed anything, but the marinade added subtle flavors that complemented it.  It's really hard to recommend a grilling time for chicken, because the pieces in one package can be wildly different in size.  Let an instant read thermometer be your guide.  I had one piece of chicken that took twice as long as the others to cook.  I used Lime Cilantro Rice, a recipe from this site, and we grilled some asparagus.  Thanks for posting!",
