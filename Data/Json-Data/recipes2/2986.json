You can get amazing California EVOO for less than $10. You can get great EVOO from Crete for the same price. Everyday EVOO... check reviews and make a decision.  Respectfully submitted.",

In order to avoid the chicken drying out, prepare as described, but cook just the potatoes for the first 20-25 minutes.  Then pull the pan out of the oven, place the chicken on the pan, making sure to recoat it in the marinade, and cook for the remaining 20 minutes.  It comes out juicy and flavorful every time.",

The lemon flavor was nice in the chicken, but is rather strong in the potatoes so some of the kids were put off.  Chicken was very moist.  I ended up having to cook longer than the instructions and turn on the broiler on the chicken to crisp up the skins.  I drained out the excess marinade in order to even get the potatoes mildly crispy under the broiler.  Maybe it was the 2/3 cup of broth that made the liquid ratio out of balance, but I was very dissatisfied with the consistency of the potato ( 1/2 mush, 1/2 just right).  I read and re-read the recipe several times thinking I had missed a step or gotten something wrong.  Wouldn't make again, but was ok for a dinner night.",
