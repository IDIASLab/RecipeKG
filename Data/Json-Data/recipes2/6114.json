The honey was so overpowering that I could barely taste the other ingredients. I thought about just dumping it but then decided to add an 1/8 tsp of lemon juice. The lemon really helped. But it still wasn't a sauce to brag about. Finally I just dumped a tsp of red chili flakes into it. The flakes at least added a bit of interest to the sauce. With my fixes it's OK.
