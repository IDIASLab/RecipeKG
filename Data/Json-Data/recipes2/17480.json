The most significant thing I did that added flavor was to use leftover chicken that was baked with lemon and garlic--I even chopped and tossed in the clove of garlic that was baked with the whole chicken. It turned out great--five out of five family members liked it including the one who wrinkled her nose before the first bite. The only problem was that it was watery and that made the crust a little soggy. Anyone know where the liquid came from and how to correct that? Even so this is a keeper.",

I did add just a little more chicken (1/2 cup) to make it a little more hearty and I only added 6oz of swiss so I would have the opportunity to add a good sprinkle of parmesan ramono and mozzerlla. I LOVE cheese and all these go well together. I highly recommend this quiche. My husband isn't big on quiche because he says it's not \"meat and potatoes\" he really like this one and he's also the reason for the addition in chicken. Thanks Shannonlia for such a great dish!",

I had the pillbury crust you unroll and put in a glass pie plate so I used 3 X-Lg eggs and the 1 cup milk. I also added salt and fresh ground black pepper. I decided to address the blandness by adding 4 strips of crumbled bacon to the chicken mixture. I still thought it needed a little more flavor. Next time I will try adding part cheddar and part swiss cheese more onion and maybe a dash of worcestershire.",
