If you want more chocolate try substituting chocolate milk mix or syrup - something designed to dissolve in cold liquids. We did 4 shakes & 2 people (1 man & 1 woman) could not finish. Easy prepared with items already in cupboard and makes enough to be dessert. Biggest complaint - TOO THIN. Add less milk & you'll be fine.",

And it saved me about 7 dollars because it's expsensive to buy. It made 2 tall glasses!
