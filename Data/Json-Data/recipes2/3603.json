Hubby said it tasted really good but had to admit the curdled look was a bit off putting.  Followed recipe to a T so not for sure why sauce looked as it did.  My family is a visual kind of brood so something looking appetizing is a must! Won't make this one again but gave it three stars for ease of making and taste.",

We like \"saucy\" recipes because baked chicken can be a little dry, so I used the entire can of FF evaporated milk and increased the parmesan cheese.  This tasted like a chicken cutlet with incredible gravy.  This recipe uses a few pots, pans and bowls but definitely worth it.  Paired this recipe with the herbed noodles (from this site).  I'm so glad I made the extra sauce to put over the bland noodles.  This will be made again and again in our house!",

There is no way you can brown all of that chicken in 2 tsp of oil so I kept adding more to the pan. Also it took way longer to bake than 25 minutes. I had to keep it in the oven for 50 minutes before it hit 160. It was still moist but the baking time is understated.",
