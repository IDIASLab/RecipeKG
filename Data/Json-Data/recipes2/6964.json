Really love the flavors but my only problem was that the grease/liquid never evaporated enough so I did have to end up draining it which was fine (the flavor was still there) but I thought it would all cook down better. I would call this more of a bacon 'topping' b/c to me a jam or chutney would be thicker and more on the sweet side IMO. Anyways I think next time (yes I will be making this again) I would drain some (if not most) of the fat from the bacon before adding the onions butter and garlic so maybe the bourbon would evaporate better. Thanks for sharing.:)",
