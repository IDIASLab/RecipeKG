I found the oats proportions to be fine I used \"Silver Palate\" Oats which are high quality (afterall these are adult cookies). My hubby also has high cholesterol so I use a stick of regular \"I Can't Believe It's Not Butter\" instead. (In any recipe I just omit any additional salt because ICBINB unfortunately is pre-salted) I don't bother with the hand blender I just use a wooden spoon and a big bowl and break up the butter as I add more \"wet\" ingredients to the bowl. Even as I add the flour mixture if I have any leftover chunks of butter I try to flatten them with the wooden spoon on the sides of the bowl as I mix. Next time I'll try to lighten up on the Splenda blend by 1/4c as we found them a bit oversweet. When you have really good quality Oats you want to taste them and not sugar. The texture was wonderfully chewy inside and slightly crisp outside.",

I tried the recipe again only I used 1 c. regular splenda (not the blend) and 1/2c of sugar free syrup. I also added 1/2 c. whole wheat flour doubled the molasses and used 3 large eggs. This time they were AMAZING!!! The dough balls turned into perfect cookes crispy outside chewy inside. With the modifications I'll make these again.
