I baked it in a 350\u00ba oven for a few minutes until the cheese melted.  Fantastic!",

I chose it not for its unique qualities or its creativity, but simply for that fact that I'm not too familiar using a steamer so I chose this as a reference guide to gauge how long to steam the zucchini. Even being strictly just a \"recipe\" for how to steam zucchini, it was way off.  The cooking time is far too long, resulting in zucchini that turned to mush once touched.  For a recipe that calls for nothing more than cooking directions and simply seasoning with olive oil and a little garlic (not even salt and pepper!) one would have thought that its fundamental purpose, steaming the zucchini until done, would have offered a reliable cooking time. Next time I do this (if I even bother to steam zucchini again) I'd immediately shave a good four or five minutes off the cooking time.  You can always cook it longer, but once it's mush, it's mush.",
