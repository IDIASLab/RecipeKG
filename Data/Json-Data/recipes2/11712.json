Yes there is a tiny bit of a tang from the yogurt but it's not overpowering. Effortless to make literally taking just a few minutes. I didn't have Greek yogurt so I used the Dannon non-fat plain yogurt I had in the fridge and just drained it for about an hour in a colander lined with paper towels. I could see using vanilla yogurt for a slight variation on flavor as well. On top of these positive comments nutritionally it's a superstar...you can satisfy that sweet tooth without guilt!",

So, I decided to just blend it and drank it. It tasted like tart chocolate milk. The second time I made sure to buy the thickest yogurt type I know of and used that. This time I mixed in and it had a thicker texture. However, it just looked and tasted like chocolate flavored yogurt. It definitely didn't have the dark chocolaty appearance of the main photo. It was more of a tan color. If you are looking to make flavored yogurt, this would be the recipe to go to. Using a thick Greek yogurt works well to do that. A mousse though, this is not.",

As a result I had to microwave chocolate for about 2 minutes (and I used 80% power to avoid burning chocolate). I also used a 70% cocoa dark chocolate (was a bit bitter for this recipe I think a 50% would be perfect!) and I only added 1c plain greek yogurt (this is the key...it MUST be greek for it to have the mousse texture) and added 1/4 tsp of vanilla (pure) to it. I topped it with fresh strawberries! Delicious. Serves 2. THANKS for the great recipe idea!!!",
