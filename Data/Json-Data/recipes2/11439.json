Products/Brands Used: I used Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers (9 oz pkg) Lily's Extra Dark Stevia Chocolate Bars (4 of their 2.8 oz bars) Domino granulated sugar Stevia in the Raw Land O' Lakes salted butter and Carnation Evaporated Whole Milk (12 oz. can) Crust: Omit the sugar and stevia. Just use the crushed chocolate wafers and butter. Ganache: Reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and use 3/4 cup Stevia in the Raw. Since I used Lily's Extra Dark Stevia Chocolate instead of unsweetened chocolate I was able to use less sugar. To reduce the fat content I used 1 cup of Carnation evaporated whole milk and reduced the heavy cream to 1/4 cup. To roughly crush the chocolate I beat the chocolate bars with a kitchen mallet while they were still fully wrapped in their packaging.",
