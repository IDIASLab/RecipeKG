I also added about 5 oz. of low fat cream cheese to the low fat cool whip mixture.  Then used cut up strawberries, blackberries, bananas (with pineapple juice mixed with them to keep them from browning) and pineapple pieces.  Next time I will cut the pieces of the pizza before adding the fruit, because when I cut the pizza after adding the pieces fruit, it got all messed up and didn't look as pretty.
