Made this last night for dinner on my George Foreman grill.I did everything according to recipe.I marinated a thick Ribeye steak for about 9 hours and sliced a large portabella mushroom for the sauce.It was soo delish!!!! I often sautee mushrooms or onions with our steak but My DH always uses steak sauce anyway but with this recipe no steak sauce was needed. He loved it!!! I thought it was a bit sweet but very tasty. We will definately be having this again. I made this again and had a different taste - The cocktail sauce you use makes a big difference in flavor. Thank you for sharing your recipe",

Instead of on the grill I cubed the steak and let it simmer in all the marinade in a large skillet. After the steak was a little over half way done I added the mushrooms and let it continue simmering. I served it over rice and it turned out great. The only thing I am going to do different next time is add some sliced onion to the mix.",
