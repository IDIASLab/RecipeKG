I also sauteed the chicken in garlic and a bit of chicken broth for added flavor eliminating the grease of the bacon but scraping up the drippings from the pan instead so we got the bacon flavor. Also added some fresh broccoli per another reviewer. Served over buttered noodles and with garlic breadsticks. I might make it again with the changes.",
