I used \"Fajita Seasoning,\" also from this site, for the fajita seasoning and I was very pleased with it.  I used a combination of thinly sliced strip steak and shrimp, marinating them together with the seasoning and a dribble of water and olive oil.  I saut\u00e9ed the vegetables first, seasoned with the fajita seasoning and garlic.  Once crisp-tender, I removed the mixture from the pan, then continued by cooking the beef and shrimp together.  When that was cooked I combined everything together.  Not only were these easy to throw together, served with a squeeze of fresh lime,  some shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream,  they were awesome good too,  a huge payoff for such little effort invested.",
