I asked the submitter about the difference if using mayo verses Miracle Whip before executing the recipe and was told it shouldn't make a difference. SO I proceeded. Everything came together nicely and the marshmallow creme frosting was very nice and light which gave a nice contrast to the orange flavored that topped it. I will make again My kids just loved them.
