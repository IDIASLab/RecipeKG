Let simmer to just wilt the spinach and dish out to plate. Top with sliced provolone cheese. Let stand for 2 minutes to allow cheese to soften and slightly melt...serve!!",

The second time I used pork cutlets because veal is too expensive to use in an experiment. It worked well with my changes so I made it again with veal. I season my flour with white pepper rubbed sage and garlic powder. I switched to dry white wine and cut it back to 1/4 cup so the veal doesn't stew in the oven and honestly I think it would be just as good without it. Ryan your instincts were good and I hope you aren't offended by my changes.",
