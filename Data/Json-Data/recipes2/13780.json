I did my own version: Substituted olive oil with canola oil; Supplemented the paprika with cumin; Used the chicken skin to flavor the rice and peppers then discarded the skin; Supplemented the bell pepper with 3 more serano peppers; Supbtituted whole tomates & liquid with diced tomatoes & liquid; Also I believe using my Le Cruset for this dish made it better than a regular pot. I think it will make good leftovers too.",
