I just added some minced garlic to butter with a splash of olive oil and spread that over the bread. I broiled that until nice and golden brown. I sliced the tomatoes and sprinkled a little kosher salt and cracked black pepper over top then drizzled with the balsamic vinegar. I then assembled the sandwich and didn't bother putting it back into the oven. I cut it into sections and it was oh so yummy!",

Toasted ciabatta really is the perfect choice for bread--nicely \"bulky\" but not heavy. The family felt balsamic vinegar was critical to the dish. This may have been especially true because rosemary didn't sound quite right and I omitted it. Otherwise made precisely as directed. A wonderful recipe.",
