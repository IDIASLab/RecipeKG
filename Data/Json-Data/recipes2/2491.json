I was surfing for an idea for dinner, saw the recipe and immediately wanted to try it . I didn't have all the ingredients on hand - I had to sub whipping cream with evaporated\u00a0milk, smoked salmon with canned salmon, fettuccine with Chinese quick-cooking vegetable-flavored noodles - and topped it off with black caviar. This dish was simply superb! I will be making it again following your recipe as is because I know we will not be disappointed.\u00a0Thank you for sharing.",
