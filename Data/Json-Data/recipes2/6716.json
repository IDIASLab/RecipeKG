I seasoned the meat with salt & pepper prior to adding it to the marinade. I did not add the onion & peppers to the marinade because I was leery about the contamination from the meat. I cooked everything in a cast iron skillet cooking the onions & peppers first until tender and softened then I added in the meat seering it on both sides. Delicious!
