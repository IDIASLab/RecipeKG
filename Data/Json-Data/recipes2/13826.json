I was prepared for the cake to be ugly it isn t. It has a pretty golden exterior and the cake itself a delicate and pretty pastel green. Too sweet and too limey some reviews said nope it s just right. In fact in hindsight I would have added some grated lime zest maybe a tablespoon. Tastes awful SO like a cake mix. Wrong again. While I don t necessarily think it would fool anybody it nevertheless does not have that obvious commercial cake mix taste tho I m convinced this is because I started out with a French Vanilla cake mix better as far as I m concerned than lemon yellow or white cake mixes. I thought maybe a cup of oil would make this heavy and greasy but it was not. Again I used a Duncan Hines French Vanilla cake mix (deliberately as with all this oil I did NOT want a pudding-included cake mix). I used fresh-squeezed orange juice which really was why I chose this recipe in the first place as I had a number of oranges to use. I baked it in a Bundt pan 325 degrees for about 55-60 minutes. Fearful of infusing any more moisture or sweetness into the cake I did not use the recipe s glaze. I used a simple powdered sugar and fresh lime juice glaze. I m pleasantly surprised.",

I just baked it, and havent even poured the frosting on it yet. I just leveled the layers and got to nibble on some of the extra..WOW! its delish!\nI did not purchase the lemon cake mix, I used yellow instead. All I had here in my pantry. And it still came out wonderful, I just added 1/2 tsp of lemon extract, when I still felt that diddnt give it enough tang I gave it 1/2 tsp of lime juice. I am going to frost it with a cream cheese frosting with a few tbls of lime thrown in. I will make this over and over. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!Edit:8/27/08- I have made this cake over and over. I have made it in a bundt pan with a lime glaze and powdered sugar over it. I have also made it into a 1/4 sheet cake by doubling the recipe, and using a cream cheese lime frosting. YUM",
