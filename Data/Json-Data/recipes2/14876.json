Anyway, my \"build\" idea is this (seems complicated, but it's not).  Heat the empty tray under the broiler.  Meanwhile, LIGHTLY toast the bread -- you just want it dried out, not actually toasted.  Butter the sides of the bread that will face down.  On one slice, stack corned beef, sauerkraut and cheese on top; on the OTHER slide, stack beef, cheese, then kraut on top.  Take the baking sheet out, place the two stacked halves next to eachother, and broil.  When done, slide them off with a spatula, top with dressing, and combine.  Now you have altnerating layers of heaven, and the bread should be buttery, crunchy, not burnt, and not soggy.  GREAT recipe! :)",

You have to be really quick or the bottom piece of bread will get soggy. It's best to make an extra sandwich rather than piling it high.
