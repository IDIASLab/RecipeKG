                "reviewBody": "As others have suggested you ll probably end up tripling the sauce amount; the fried chicken chunks generally absorb the relatively small amount of sauce mixture that is called-for very quickly. Use sesame oil (refined for high heat) for frying. I d also recommend that you pre-mix together the teriyaki sauce and honey separately in a small dish (or measuring cup) as opposed to adding each of those separately to the chicken pieces after you put them back in the skillet. This prevents one or the other tastes from becoming overly dominant. And I would definitely not omit the five-spice powder as this is the unique exotic ingredient that has a chance to give this dish a distinctively Asian taste. The end result of this recipe is relatively unsweet; if you do like more sweetness (most restaurant-style sesame chicken is actually sweeter than this recipe) I d add brown sugar to taste when you're at the final mix and maybe a little soy sauce and ginger powder. Not the best I've had but all in all a very well-done easy recipe!",

I halved the amount of flour and I substituted the five-spice powder in favor of a packet of Honey Sesame seasoning mix that I found in the oriental food section of the supermarket. I used thin sliced chicken breast which browns quicker it only took about 2-3 minutes per side. Also I used broccoli and carrots rather than the onion and peppers. Like many others had suggested I made more sauce than called for. I tripled up on the teriyaki sauce but be cautious to not use too much honey. Don't bother to add the toasted sesame seeds until the end. I recommend keeping the red pepper flakes as they add just a slight amount of heat. Very simple and quick to make as well as delicious!",

To make quick work of the sauce and to cut down on overmixing (and by overmixing I mean losing some of the \"crust\" on the chicken) I mixed the teryaki sauce and honey together before pouring it over the chicken. I do not have a wok I made this in my cast iron skillet--I was pretty proud of that. Wok or not this still turned out darn tasty. My husband and kids inhaled this. I made a Japanese-Style cabbage salad to go with it my husband made a comment that those two combined would make a great lettuce wrap.",

It is going from a 5 star to a 2 star - something has changed in the listing of the recipe! The first time it must have said to make the Fish and Things Teriyaki Marinade this recipe now states add 2 T teriyaki sauce. Well I thought teriyaki sauce was just out of the bottle and it was really bad. Not sweet no flavor and definitely not enough. Like a had to add 3/4 of a bottle and a ton of honey and it still wasn't sweet. SO- remembering the first time when it was a \"5\" I used the Fish and Things and it was to die for. Somebody please fix this recipe back the way it was. It had been great before!!!! MY MY MY! Very addicting! This is awesome!! We also made enough sauce to make it drowned in it! The Teriyaki recipe makes plenty so why not use it. We served it over basmati rice and the whole family loves this!",

I skipped the five-spice (I HATE black licorice and that's what the flavor primarily is -- comes from the anise) in favor of some powdered ginger. The flour didn't stick well to the chicken so the pieces didn't have a \"crunch\" but that's okay with me. Also I sauteed thinly sliced onion and a clove of elephant garlic in a combination of sesame oil and wok oil (basically garlic oil) first then removed them before adding the chicken. Then I added 1/2 C each of honey and teriyaki which made plenty of sauce (enough for the jasmine rice to soak into) before returning the garlic and onion to the skillet. My picky picky 4-year-old cleaned his plate! Can't wait for lunch leftovers!! Thanks SO much! Had leftovers today and wasn't pleased -- way too sweet. Will try replacing some of the teryiaki with soy sauce next time to cut down on the sweetness.",
