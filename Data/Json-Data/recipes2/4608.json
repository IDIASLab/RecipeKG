My version adds 1/2 cup chopped nuts (we always used walnuts, but pistachios, almonds or pecans would be good.)  This time I decided to forgo the DreamWhip and made my own whipped cream mixed with pistachio pudding for the frosting.  It turned out great and I'll make that substitution from now on.  My handwritten recipe is looking a little grungy, so I'm glad to have it here, as well!  Thank you!",
