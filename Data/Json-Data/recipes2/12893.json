The almond bark melts into a smooth consistency way better than the chips. I refrigerated the balls before covering however I recommend freezing them. The balls still crumbled and \"dirtied\" the white melt. I also used toothpicks to remove the balls after rolling them in the melt. This helped a little as using fingers left bare spots. If anyone has tips on how to make them as smooth as the pictures above I'd love to here. They taste great however I am disappointed with them visually.",

For decorating I used colored chocolate discs melted in decorator bottles. It is thicker than the gel and not as messy. They were adorable!",

I apparently make my balls bigger because I tripled the recipe and I still only ended up with about only about 22. The store didn't have red oreos so I used the green mint ones instead. I also used vanilla almond bark. I also was a little generous on the cream cheese because I wanted to make sure they would stick together well. I did put the snowman faces on them but they sure don't look as cute as the professional ones. However I work with kids so they won't mind at all. I didn't have problems with making them solid white but I did put them in the refrigerator for about 30 min before I warmed up my almond bark and when I made them into balls I rolled them in my hands like play-dough to make sure they were put together well. These were fun to make and I will most likely do it again before the season is over.",
