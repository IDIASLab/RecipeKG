Have made it a few times and it's better with higher fat milk of course but also if the yolks are tempered with the hot milk/Splenda mixture instead of stirring them in at the beginning. This eliminates having to strain the scrambled egg bits out of the drink later on. Very custardy and rich. The addition of the rum is just OMG good.",

To get the rum flavor without the alcohol (because my kids love eggnog just as much as I do) I added a tablespoon of pure rum flavoring. For a fake-it eggnog this is actually pretty tasty. This makes a GREAT DIY coffee creamer. To store it I just poured the hot \"eggnog\" into Ball jars and let it cool in the fridge. NOTE: Make sure you stir this before you serve it.",
