It's a meltingly tender, sharp-flavored stew that can be made with pork or chicken. Best served over rice. (For a thicker sauce, be sure to blend flour with liquid before adding to sauce to prevent lumps from forming.)",

I let the soy sauce vinegar and broth (and bay leaves and garlic) reduce in the dutch oven which worked wonders on the chicken but I didn't feel that adding the coconut milk really improved anything other than thickening a sauce that didn't really work as a sauce for me. I would make this again because it flavored the meat so well but maybe next time I'll serve the chicken without a pool of sauce to flavor it and the rice if that makes sense. Either way Metalmommy thank you for the recipe. I liked it very much and I hope my comments don't seem to indicate otherwise:)",
