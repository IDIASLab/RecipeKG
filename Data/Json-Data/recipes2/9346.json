She did, however put a small pile of fried potatoes in the center of each serving which added a nice  crunch.  Since she was not concerned with photographing her picadillo  she served on top of a bed of rice and the fried potatoes provided the garnish.\n\nAnother essential feature of her Picadillo was a side of tostones or fried plantains.  Unfortunately, plantains can be hard to find in the Pacific North West.  Her tostones were not sliced plantain chips but were inch long chunks that were fried twice.  After the first frying they were cooled in iced salt water and then smashed, by hand,  between  two layers of paper towels before being  fried the second time.",

I didn't have red wine vinegar or pimento olives---so I used a little mix of red wine and balsamic vinegar and just regular black olives. I also used raisins instead of currants. I really liked the combination of spices, and that little bit of sweet you get when you bite into a raisin. I've never had Picadillo before, so I can't comment on this tasting \"authentic\" or whatever, but I do know that this tastes good! It is also very easy and fast to make for a weeknight dinner.

I got many compliments and a request to bring it next time we go to a pot luck. Great served over rice leftovers are good so this could be made ahead and reheated with no problem. The combination of flavors is unusual but truly worked. BTW we didn't eat this in Cuba but wish we had since it was so much better than our meal there. I'm thinking of trying the recipe with deli chicken for a change but I wouldn't mind eating this every week. Thanks for a great recipe!",
