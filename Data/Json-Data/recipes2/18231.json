The second time I made them, I did so based on what I learned from the first time: I used candy coating discs with just a handful of chocolate chips thrown in. Great flavor and they set up much firmer than straight chocolate chips.  No need to worry about the temperature...just whisk and 'nuke' til fully melted.  I used ridged Kettle chips.  They're sturdier, hold up better to the chocolate and you actually get a potato chip flavor afterwards.  I held an end of the chip, dipped all but about 1/4 of the chip into the chocolate, gently wiped the excess chocolate off on the side of the bowl, laid the chip on a cooling rack (laid over a jelly roll pan) and added just a SMALL pinch of popcorn salt across the top.  We're huge fans of the salty/sweet combo and this is the 'icing on the cake' for that.  Allowed them to 'set' and stored in an airtight container.",
