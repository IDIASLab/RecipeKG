It wasn't great. I stuffed it in the freezer and cranked the thermostat to get the air flowing. After some time to chill it became better but still had the after taste that I personally didn't enjoy but during the eat I did enjoy the chilled version. Tried it again the next day... but added Feta to it. The Feta helped so much to kill the taste of the oil. Finally I added half an Italian dressing packet to the remainder. Add Feta when plated. Now I love this combination. everything has a bit of a crunch and the after flavor is nice as well. Great combination just needs an extra kick in my book.",
