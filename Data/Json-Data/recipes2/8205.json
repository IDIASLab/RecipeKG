It smells so good while simmering.  The Chef's notes talk about removing the pork chunks into a separate bowl to shred them and that was exactly what I did.  I served it over Tagliatelle pasta, but it is so good and thick that I could eat it with just a loaf of Italian bread!",

I served on creamy Parmesan polenta and it was divine.\n\nChanges:  Removed a lot of the fat . . . Didn't fry.  Cut up meat and everything else into the crock pot.  (I tried it both ways and didn't get extra flavor by searing the meat).  It's certainly more manageable to make it a crock pot recipe where you put everything but the mushrooms in at first.  Then I followed instructions 3 to 4 hours on high add mushrooms when meat starts to fall apart and 1 to 2 hours on low after adding mushrooms.",
