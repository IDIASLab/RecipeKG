I made a few adjustments; first of all I forgot to pick up fudge topping so just subbed chocolate sauce & a few pieces of melted milk chocolate. In addition I only used 16 Snickers fun size bars. Once I folded in the whipped topping I also added in a few chuncks of Reese's pb cups that I had chopped up just for texture. I used a deep dish graham cracker pie crust and had waaaayyyy too much filling; probably could have made 2 regular sized pies. Put the pie in the freezer for 5 hours and then swirled with chocolate sauce & topped with more chopped peanut butter cups. Everyone at dinner said it was really really good (even my picky mother) & that is what I was hoping for! Just make sure to remember that a little slice of this pie goes a looonnnggg way.:)",
