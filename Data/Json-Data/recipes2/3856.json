                "reviewBody": "Excellent alternative to the Vietnamese spring roll. However I would make some changes to recipe. I peeled the carrot and half of the cucumber to reduce the toughness in each bite and that worked out well. It only took me about 3 seconds to wet my rice paper wrapper including flipping to the opposite side. I was confused by Chef John's meaning of \"baby greens \" so I would rewrite that to cucumbers and carrots. I found that I already had enough in my roll without adding another layer of chicken and pepper and I ended up making 6 rolls instead of 4 and they were still huge something to keep in mind if you're making a large quantity. As others mentioned this is delicious with a peanut sauce and I recommend a simple one by the Minimalist Baker on the interwebs.",
