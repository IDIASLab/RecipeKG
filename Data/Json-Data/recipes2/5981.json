This was a last minute deal so I used what I had on hand: one pound of lean ground turkey two links of uncooked sweet Italian turkey sausage panko plus 1 cup cooked rice instead of breadcrumbs 1/2 an onion a large red sweet pepper (no mushrooms) which I saut\u00e9ed until caramelized. 3 minced garlic cloves 2 carrots shredded and cheddar instead of feta were added uncooked to the turkey mix along with the listed spices and an extra egg. Tomato paste plus some ketchup (no tomato sauce) along with cayenne and smoked paprika honey and balsamic vinegar made for a thick and tasty sauce on top. Even with my sad list of pantry substitutions this turned out great. The meatloaf held together perfectly (I hate crumbly meatloaf) and the sauce turned out smoky slightly sweet and with a bit of heat. We had enough for cold meatloaf sandwiches the next day (equally terrific). Yum.",

However it doesn't get 5 stars because it requires some changes (well at least for my palate): 1) The seasoning is weird. The \"Italian\" doesn't go well with the other flavors so I would minimize it and play around. Also I couldn't find the other mix so I just added cayenne salt pepper and garlic. 2) The sauce is too \"balsamic-y\" with just the few ingredients and there isn't enough for my taste. I more than doubled the sauce and added tamari Worcestershire sriracha and instead of honey I used a pineapple habanero salsa from Costo (we can't get enough of the stuff). Obviously we like things spicy-sweet. 3)To cut down on carbs I used less bread crumbs and I used panko (because that's what I had in the house). 4)I served it with spaghetti squash. 5)I upped the quantities of most things and for 1.5lb of turkey we got 8 servings.",
