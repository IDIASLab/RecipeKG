The marinade is so easy and uses equal parts of lime juice, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Adapted from the cookbook, All the Best Mexican Meals by Joie Warner, which is no longer in print. Top with your favorite condiments such as fresh lime, cilantro, sour cream, and cheese--I like to combine Monterey Jack and Cheddar.",
