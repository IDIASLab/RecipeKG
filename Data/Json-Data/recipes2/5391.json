I pat dried and butterflied my shrimp. I did add 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch to the flour mixture. Also I used 4 eggs instead of 2 as I double dipped. After the first coconut dip I dipped in egg again and packed the coconut and panko mix again! Saut\u00e9ed in olive oil 1.5 minutes each side. Came out perfect!! Boyfriend said better than the ones we had on our first date??",
