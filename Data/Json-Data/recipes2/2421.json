We did a smaller batch as more of a tester/treat. We followed the directions up until the end where we used a light brushing of oil to coat the dish - rather than butter or parchment paper. We also let ours chill for three hours to ensure a proper set. The end results were very pleasing and I can happily say that we will be redoing this recipe many times over. Next time we may even switch it up entirely! Personal Summary: Level of Difficulty: Easy Price range: 5 - 10 Time frame: 30 minutes - 1 hour",
