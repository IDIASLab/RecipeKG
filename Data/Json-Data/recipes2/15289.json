I could NOT get the breadcrumbs to stick to the onions! I crushed the crumbs down to almost nothing but they would not stay on the onions. I then got frustrated with that and started just coating with flour and dipping in the batter. I couldn't tell the difference between the two. My bread crumbs were soggy and stuck together; they ended up being a great treat for my dogs! When eating the rings they were incredibly bland. Maybe if the crumbs would have stuck it would have tasted better but that didn't work. I sprinkled with garlic salt and that seemed to give some flavor. I won't make this again.",
