They are almost square which shows off the mix beautifully, plus a regular mason lid, metal or plastic, fits perfectly. I use these jars for canning since they're so pretty and right between pint and quart size. I also put the pasta in small plastic bags and knotted them to prevent spilling when removing from the jar.",

I gave the soup mix along with a wooden spoon, the can of tomatoes and 2 cans of tomato sauce in a gift bag with a box of corn muffin mix.  (The only thing the recipient had to provide was the ground beef, garlic powder, pepper and water).  Needless to say, it was a HUGE hit and everyone that has tried this LOVES it.  This recipe makes a ton, but those that had company over the holidays appreciated this no fuss meal that served a gang  THANKS SO MUCH!  Again, my dogs got a sampling in their dog food which they gave 5 stars to also.  GREAT RECIPE",
