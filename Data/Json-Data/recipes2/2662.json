I did use a teaspoon of dried parsley rather than fresh, and the olive oil I used was lime flavored.  I think that between 1/4 and 1/3 cup of bread crumbs would be a great option because I had some of my Progresso Italian crumbs left over.  I wondered how I was going to make this breading stay on the pork chop without the usual flour/egg/breading recipe type, but it just did.  My pork chops were bone-in and not as thick as I'd have liked them, so they did cook fast in the oven---only about 15 minutes after browning them on stovetop.  You need to moosh the breading mixture together with a fork to get it to hang together, but it really does.  Thanks for dinner tonight, Fenhoff!",
