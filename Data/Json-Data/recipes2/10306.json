Though it didn't say what type of salsa so I used salsa verde which is my favorite and with enchiladas. I bought a pack of handmade flour tortillas from Trader Joes. It had 8 in the pack but they were a descent size to use. I lined a 13x9 with the foil and sprayed with cooking spray. I actually do this often when baking and highly suggest. It works great for clean-up. The recipe did not say how much cheese to put inside versus on top. So I mixed 1 cup with the filling and a generous 1/2 a cup on top. I used shredded pepper jack cheese to add more flavor. For the chicken I just boiled 3 large chicken breast let them cool and shredded them. I also used lite soup and sour cream as it was what I had and it did not seem to be a problem. The cook time was perfect on this. ty",
