It didn't have enough \"liquid\" for us--I added a quarter cup more of the mayonnaise and a second tablespoon of dijon mustard. This is a great simple potato salad recipe--everyone loved it. Next time I'll double it and add more garlic. As with any potato salad the longer it sits the better it gets.",
