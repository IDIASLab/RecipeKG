Didn't have Verdelho so I used an open bottle of cab that I had. Substituted fresh spinach (6 oz) for canned because I like the taste better added a second can of tuna and used cream in place of milk because I wanted to use it up and thought it would be good. I also had french fried onions that I used in place of bread crumbs. Despite the substitutions (which I don't think changed the flavor all that much) I think this is a great basic recipe that adds more flavor and veggies to a traditional tuna noodle casserole. You can really add any veggies you want to this- I think it would be good with onions corn peas etc.",
