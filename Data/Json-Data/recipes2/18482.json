The hot chocolate is the secret ingredient here; it flattens the heat curve, allowing the full flavour of the chili to present itself before the heat comes on in a satisfying finish.  I made only a couple of changes to the recipe; being a red meat kind of guy, I used 1 lb of lean ground beef and 1 lb of ground moose, and added about a cup of pinto beans.  The only other modification was using one red bell pepper and one green pepper.  The finished product was absolutely stellar, and wound up easily winning first place at the company chili cook-off; it was the first pot to empty and people coming for thirds were disappointed to see it gone.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  To anyone considering deleting the hot chocolate or subbing pure cocoa: if you do, consider trying with the hot chocolate as well.  The effect of the cocoa and the sugar on the heat of the habaneros and hot sauce is pure magic.",

I am usually not a fan of spicy foods but its the kind of spicy that creeps up after you put it in your mouth then gets milder as soon as you swallow so you aren't frantically gasping for water. I used the exact recipe except for two things: I added two whole jalapenos in with the veggies to sautee only because my boyfriend likes to eat them whole. I also added a full can of corn oh and because I only had 1.3 lbs of turkey I added an extra can of kidney beans. I used both light and dark which makes for pretty colors. Thanks so much for this!",
