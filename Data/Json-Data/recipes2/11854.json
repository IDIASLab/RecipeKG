It is more like a healthy scratch recipe for a hamburger helper with beans instead of the noodles. I used lean beef and simple subs I had to make were using chicken taco seasoning for fajita seasoning kidney beans for the pinto cooked farro for the brown rice and I made my own homemade fresh salsa today with tomatoes onions green peppers etc. I have to admit I liked it best before adding the cheese. It tasted much better on top. I later added extra homemade salsa to bring back the fresher flavor and a little extra seasoning. Just be careful with the seasoning if not wanting too much of a salty flavor. Either way it made for a quick meal on a busy day and I don't normally consider hamburger dishes high fiber ones.",
