I made some cinnamon sugar (1/4 cup of white sugar with 1 tsp. of cinnamon) and put that into a ziploc bag. I cut a loaf of Italian bread (cinnamon raisin bagels would be great with this too) into nice sized cubes and tossed them with melted butter. I tossed the butter coated bread in the ziploc bag and shook them until they were evenly coated. They baked up nicely and smelled great in the oven. I can see a lot of uses for these if I can manage to put them in a recipe before they're all gone.....",

I imagine all sorts of possibilities for these sweet crunchy little treats - as a topping for vanilla custard over ice cream with caramel sauce or over warm homemade applesauce. They could be layered into banana pudding with sliced bananas and left in the fridge overnight like you do with 'nilla wafers. Crunch them up into crumbs and sprinkle on top of your yogurt in the morning. The sky's the limit! Think of all the ways that you could use savory croutons and then apply it to a sweet situation. Great recipe!",
