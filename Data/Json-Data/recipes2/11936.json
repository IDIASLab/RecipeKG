I prepared exactly as directed and I did not change any ingredients except to use only one head of cabbage. This dish was not part of my culture growing up so though I have heard of it I've never had it before. It was tasty and filling. A great way to incorporate vegetables I believe I will omit the cabbage and turn it into a meat loaf which IS part of my culture. I served it with pureed cauliflower subbing for mashed potatoes and we enjoyed the meal. Thanks for the idea!",
