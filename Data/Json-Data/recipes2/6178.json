I followed the recipe instructions, but found myself having difficulty visualizing the little cheese balls just hanging out and being eaten at a bbq, so I basically dumped all of the cheese into the bowl and made one large cheese ball. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. I drizzled the rosemary honey on top (and reapplied throughout the evening as needed), and everybody was blown away. People were literally standing in awe in front of the bowl - that's how good it was.\n\nAs far as pecans go, I somehow found these Emerald Nuts Pecan Pie glazed pecans, and I think the extra sweetness pushed this recipe over the edge from yummy to go away this bowl is mine get your own. EVERYBODY loved it. I've committed this to memory and will definitely be making it again, probably even better around the holidays.",
