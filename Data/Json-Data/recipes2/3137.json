If I were to make it again, I'd make some adjustments: More butter in the crust layer, it did not stick together. I think the cream cheese layer could be eliminated completely. I would only use 1 packet of pudding and cut the bananas into smaller pieces. And possibly more sugar in the whipped cream topping!",
