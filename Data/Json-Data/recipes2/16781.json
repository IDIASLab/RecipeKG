The contrast of the bite of the peppercorns with the sweetness of the red pepper was interesting piquant and delicious. This \"paste\" permeates the meat and flavors it beautifully and that coupled with the wine and chicken broth the submitter advised to add in a separate review made for a wonderful sauce. I left the lemon off mine hubs included it in his - -we were both pleased as pie! I served this with rice pilaf (parsley buttered potatoes would have been good too) and fresh asparagus. Great dish with a lovely presentation.",
