All desert recipes assume that you will use unsalted but for most of them it makes little difference. In a recipe like this one the difference is huge. With unsalted it is rich and delicious. With salted it is like just eating a cube of butter. This is not a light fluffy kind of mousse but a rich and dense one. It makes an excellent filling for cakes using either white or brown chocolate. And if you whip it for a very long time it will be solid and crumbly when chilled",
