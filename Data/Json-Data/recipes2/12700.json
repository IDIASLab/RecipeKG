The directions mention that it will be lumpy but do not fear! They turned a nice golden color and released from tiny waffle maker nicely. We opted to top them with Hershey's S'mores pieces which are new. It's a bag of milk chocolate chips graham cookie pieces and mini marshmallows. We also melted some Reese's peanut butter to drizzle across the tops. This meal is something that you pay a lot of money for at a restaurant but we were easily able to make at home!",
