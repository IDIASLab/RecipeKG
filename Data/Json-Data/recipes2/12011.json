Next I took the recipe's liquid ingredients along with the pumpkin and pureed it all in the blender. Next poured it over the bread cubes and baked it for 35-40 minutes at 350F. When it was done I sprinkled cinnamon sugar over top and drizzled with powder sugar and milk glaze. Yummy from all my coworkers. and what raves! Just remember to heavily grease the pan and easy clean up. Another Bake and Take.",

I took 1/2 c. pumpkin and whipped it with 1/4 c. powdered sugar and 1/2 c. cream cheese. I added 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice when it was near the end of whipping. I also added pumpkin pie spice to the egg mixture instead of the spices alone. I spread the pumpkin-cream cheese mixture inside of two slices whole wheat bread and made stuffed french toast. I served it with hot maple syrup and bacon. This made for a nice lazy Sunday lunch.",

I would not increase the pumpkin past 1/2 cup or the egg mixture may lose its consistency. I added a splash of vanilla extract (personal taste). Using Texas Toast this recipe made 6 slices = 3 servings. Either add 2 t. sugar or serve with powdered sugar or syrup. This was fantastic we'll make it again.",

I personally swapped out some of the straight cinnamon for pumpkin pie spice then added a bit of white sugar to the egg mixture because I always do for my french toast. The pumpkin flavor is subtle and my daughter even asked \"Where did the pumpkin go?\" but it is delicious. I only got six pieces out of my mixture though my bread pieces were not large and I didn't dip them very long. A big hit nevertheless!",

I doctored the recipe quite a bit which is why I gave it only four stars...but the idea alone is worth four stars so there ya go. I used only 1 egg with 1/4 cup pumpkin and added a touch of honey and a bit of milk to thin it up a bit. I kept the spices the same. My son gobbled his slice up and asked for \"mo\" which is a rare thing these days. I added the honey so no syrup would be necessary and I didn't even want any. I bet maple syrup could be used for the same effect. Overall great flavor and a good way to get some veggies in without complaints!",
