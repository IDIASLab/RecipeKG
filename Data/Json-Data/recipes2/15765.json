I think her end result is more like a brownie than cake. So call your grandma before she dies don't wait like I did! Anyway I used a can of cherry pie filling instead of the maraschino cherries. I just put half a cherry with some goo on top of the cream cheese mix before baking. I also used dark chocolate chips because IMHO they are the only kind! You do have to be careful about filling these too full the cake mix overwhelmed a few of these. My grandmas were always level with the top of the foil cup. She was a very careful chef! One recipe made many more than 48 minicupcakes. Oh and I also tried the new Yogurt/cream cheese mix...tasted too much like yogurt. Second batch I used 1/3 less fat cc and it was great. Susan",
