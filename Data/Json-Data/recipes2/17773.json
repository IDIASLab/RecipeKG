I'm glad I chose it! I did make some changes based on reviews and what I had on hand. I can't have store-bought Ranch Dressing so I make my own. Instead of using the salad dressing/mayo and the dry mix I just used an equal amount of already prepared Ranch Dressing. I used a can of chicken breast instead of tuna dried cranberries instead of raisens (rest of the family doesn't like them) and shredded the carrot. Since I didn't have tri-color pasta the salad needed some green so I added chopped parsely. I used a Fuji apple and sharp cheddar. Scrumptous! Thanks for the quick and easy and delicoius recipe!",
