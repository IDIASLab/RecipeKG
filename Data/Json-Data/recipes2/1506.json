I don't know if it's a difference in ingredient or what. I always use herbs fresh out of my garden and local produce. We do tend to eat this on fish tacos or pulled pork sandwiches rather than by itself so that could be part of the issue. I have experimented with this quite a bit and have found that the addition of more herbs red wine vinegar finely shredded sweet walla walla onion lemon olive oil an orange (with the juice) and a bit of sugar improve the flavor. I tend to make stuff from whatever I have on hand and this recipe was the result of needing to clean out my veggie drawer. I'm sure you can sub in just about any vegetable (broccoli slaw would be great here as would pineapple or mango.. and chili peppers to give it a spicy kick) and I recommend upping the amount of cilantro. There should be a balance between acidic sweet sour salty and spicy. Hope this helps!",
