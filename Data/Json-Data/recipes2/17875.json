My boyfriend insisted on saving the leftover sauce so a couple days later I added some shredded chicken to the peach curry sauce and sealed it in a pie crust 'pocket' like a calzone...and that was another superbly delicious meal. I would rate it higher than 5 stars if I could...thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!",

I used 3/4 cup of maple syrup and 1/2 cup of white sugar for the peach syrup. I didn't use jam. I used half a white onion instead of green onions and parsley instead of cilantro. Next time I'll use 1 1/2 tsp of curry because my children thought it was too spicy. Also I'm going to throw in some raisins. If using fresh peaches be sure to reduce heat and cook until the peaches are as soft as canned peaches and the liquid thickens.
