Usually I'm annoyed when people rate a recipe when they've completely changed it but it's like passing a stone to get a recipe approved on this site (unless of course you have a recipe for Corn Fudge which apparently they have no problem publishing... but I digress). I saw the reviews that said too saucy and too bland... so here's what I did and it might just be the best thing I've ever made. My husband is washing all the dishes right now if that's any indication. I carmelized some red onion and put that at the bottom of the 9x13. Then I put down 3 butterflied chicken breasts I had lightly browned first. Covered with a slice of swiss cheese. Poured the sauce over (sour cream sherry & 1/2 the amount of soup) and baked. Oh then sprinkled about 6 thin slices of crumbled cooked bacon. Served this crazy mess over some egg noodles and I swear I'm so darn proud of myself. This was really excellent. I stole the ideas from some other similar recipes on this site. Forgive me please for reviewing a recipe I changed so much. I just had to share.",

I used 2 mushroom soups and 1 chicken(not a fan of too much cream of chicken flavor)-the 98% fat free soups-turned out great 16 ounces of sour cream and 3/4 cup of sherry. It made a good sauce over egg noodles. I also browned the chicken before baking and I seasoned the chicken with salt/pepper/onion powder as it browned. Very tasty.",

It's funny to me that my mother & step-father make it and also my father & step-mother.  We actually switch it up occasionally with marsala instead of sherry, both are good.  My mother omits the cream of chicken soup and I like it that way better.  It is one of those things that I can throw together real fast if I just have a tub of sour cream and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  (I use one can of soup and 1/3 cup of sour cream, 1/4 cup of sherry).",
