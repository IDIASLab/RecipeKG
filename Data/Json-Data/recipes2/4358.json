This recipe consists of picking the largest dandelion flowers and leaving the entire stem behind, battering the flowers up and frying them in butter. Has a flavor similar to that of mushrooms. One word of caution...to avoid a bitter taste, make sure the dandelion flowers you're picking have not been sprayed by dogs or pesticides.",

We went out for a nice walk in a nearby field and picked dandelions then came home and fried them up. I wasn't expecting for them to taste DELICIOUS and for my three and two year old to beg me to make them again and again!! I always describe them as tasting like fried green beans without the juiciness of fried green beans. These are just crunchy little bites of heaven. To this day the minute dandelions appear in the spring my kids ask me to make them. I love the tip for soaking them in salt water to get rid of any bugs! Next time I will definitely do that.",

You should use fully opened ones and the larger ones are better in my opinion. Also the next time I make it I might try to think of a dipping sauce to add more flavor. But it was great as it was. They are also best served immediately. I also used way less flour than the recipe said.",
