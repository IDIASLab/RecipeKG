I served it with the Raspberry Sauce recipe from this site (just type Raspberry Sauce and it's the very first one) and it was great.

I used one giant avocado added four packets of Stevia and some fresh squeezed lemon juice and left the zest in. In my opinion it is rather delicious but I will have to see what the ladies think at our church meeting this evening. I will be making a raspberry sauce to top it off. I have had good success in the past using my VitaMix to puree raspberries with chia seeds to thicken and will add some Stevia if necessary.",
