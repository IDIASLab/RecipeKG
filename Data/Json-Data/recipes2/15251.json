I did not need to use any of the reserved liquid and did not have to soften the cream cheese because it was whipped style. I did not even have time to chill it. It still turned out great. I like that it has no garlic in it. The key is to be sure you really like the mustard you are using. Many thanks for sharing this recipe. I will be making it often.",
