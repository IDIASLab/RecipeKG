I cooked on foil and baked in my oven using a pizza dough recipe I found on Kraft that we like (I made one large 16\" round pizza) and adding diced onions and peppers to the sausage when I cooked it. I used canned mushrooms since we were out of fresh. I used mozzarella cheese and sprinkled Italian seasoning and garlic powder on the ingredients to give a little extra \"Italian\" flavoring along with the sprinkling of Parmesan. Baking on the foil was not only super easy for clean up it gave a very nice texture to the crust and we all really enjoyed this dish!",
