I prepared the marinade the night before.  I first started with 1 batch, and realizing how little it makes, so I decided to double the recipe.  I used all together 3 tbsp soy sauce, doubling calls for 6, so I cut in half, about 3 tbsp of honey, 2 tbsp oil, juice from 2 fresh limes(squeezed dry), 2 tsp of garlic, and chicken(I used chicken tenders).  Lowering the soy sauce and upping the honey and lime juice is key.  I can see how the soy could become a prominent flavor.  I marinated over night, turning once.  The next day I grilled on low, and the chicken came out tender, juicy, and full of flavor. The flavor was very well blended.  You could taste just a hint of everything. My family loved this.  There were no leftovers disappointingly.  The next time I will be sure to make a little extra marinade and set it aside.  This would be great to have on hand at dinner for an extra kick of flavor and juices. Also, I served this with the oven roasted potatoes from this site, and asparagus (which we put on the grill with the chicken). I topped everything off with some fresh parmesan and romano cheese.\r\n",
