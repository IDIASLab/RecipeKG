Major plusses:   it only took a few minutes to make since I used packaged shredded cheese AND it can be made a few days ahead.   BUT it does need more flavor.  On the recommendation of previous reviewers,   I doubled the spices,  and increased the dried cranberries to 1/2 cup.  I added Worcerstershire Sauce to taste (beginning at 1 teaspoon) and  also used the sharpest grated cheddar I could find.  Finally,  just before serving with crackers, I sprinkled 1/2 cup of toasted slivered almonds (obtained already toasted from Trader Joe's)  over the top of the cheese.  So easy and very flavorful with the increased flavorings.  I'll make it again for guests and potlucks.",

Here is what I did: used extra sharp cheddar cheese used mayo instead of the milk doubled the spices & used about 1/4 cup of the cranberries (which I chopped in the food processor before using.) You definatley need to use the extra spices & berries. I can't imagine using only 2 T berries. Just eye-ball it - trust me you need the extra berries.You might even want to throw in your favorite spices to jazz it up. I would suggest using this as a base to play with until you get a flavor you like.",
