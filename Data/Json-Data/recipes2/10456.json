First of all I made 1/2 the recipe but added 1/2 of a jalapeno pepper to the mixture, toasted the bread that was drizzled with olive oil &  garlic and topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese, put mixture on toast back into the oven to melt the additional cheese...so so good! One small avocado mixed with the feta and pepper was enough for 2 ciabatta buns (top and bottom) perfect little appetizer.",
