The bowl I chose to photograph it in did not show it off but trust me it is gorgeous. Such a deep golden yellow that you can't wait to dig in. Where I think the recipe could use some improvement is that I felt it needs a veggie of some sort. Any veggie really. Not just for color but for additional texture too. I can think of many veggies that would go good in this but in keeping things simple a handful of frozen pea/carrot mix thrown in would do the trick nicely. After tasting this I decided a few squeezes of Sriracha was necessary for me too but that is just my preference. This is a super simple recipe and a great way to use up leftovers. Not only would I make this again it has shown me a way to improve the base in other soups. Thanks for sharing!",
