I also used fresh hatch green chili also that I sauteed until skin started to brown. I then added tomatoes and corn. I increased corn to 1/2 cup. I then used 1 cup milk (I did start at 1/4 cup but it was pasty and added more to get a good consistency) to 1/4 cup flour and cooked until thickened and then added 8oz cheese. If you like things extra cheezy add the other 8oz. I then tasted the dip and it was pretty bland so I added onion powder garlic powder cayenne pepper and fresh ground pepper. Fresh cilantro would be a good addition also.",
