I used frozen figs and a fresh banana and non fat milk.  I also made it again and added a serving of fat free greek vanilla yogurt, it was yummy and made it thicker, more like a shake. Thanks, this is a great way to use up my figs a few at a time and help me in my pre-holiday dieting!",

It was great! It makes a great summer morning treat and was a hit with my kids who didn't like fresh figs before this.",
