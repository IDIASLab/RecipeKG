He said that you leave the almonds and raisins out in a dish NEXT TO the pot of glogg. People serve themselves hot glogg and add the almonds/raisins if they choose to. That way they do not get soggy.  I prefer this with MUCH LESS sugar...I don't like sweet things and I felt that the sugar brought out the flavor of the spices so much that it masked the wine. When I cut the sugar to half, it was much better.",
