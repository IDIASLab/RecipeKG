I've seen a lot of Cake Mix Cookie recipes, but I like this one because it calls for 15.25oz box of cake mix, which is usually what \"dollar stores\" carry, which is usually where I run to, when I need something at the last minute haha!! I lowered the oil to 1/3 cup, only because I prefer the taste/texture to the 1/2 cup. I've made these with various cake flavors and mix-ins (again, whatever is in stock at the dollar store). I've also used either a \"kiss\", or powdered sugar on top, in lieu of a mix-in. Any which way I've made them, they're always, quick, easy, low-cost, and a big hit with everyone!!",
