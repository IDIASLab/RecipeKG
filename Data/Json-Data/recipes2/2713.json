I found 2 tbsp per cake worked passably for me but I also didn't have a large pan. Step 1 is poorly worded. Make sure to set aside half of ONLY the green onions and parsley into their own bowl and mix ALL the salt, pepper, and rosemary into the potatoes. The part about using a silicone turner needs to be bolded. My first batch burnt after 2-3 minutes, so I recommend ignoring the time suggestions and just wait for the golden crust.",
