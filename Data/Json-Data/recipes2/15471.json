I add toasted pecans or walnuts (adding some toasted nuts is a must!) apples grapes and remove the honeydew cut the fruit cocktail to one can and take out a little of the liquid to make it not so soupy and it turns out AWESOME. I've even added mini marshmellows to it for a more ambrosia style salad. My hubby who doesn't like cream cheese even likes this. Thanks Veronica for a great fruit salad staple recipe!",

I added 1 cup chopped nuts. I had some of the cream cheese mixture left over so I used it as fruit dip the day after Thanksgiving. A real winner!",
