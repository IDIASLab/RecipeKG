While hubs ate his over rice and I ate mine over chopped lettuce both of us were pleased with this simple but flavorful healthy dish. However after trying it he pushed the avocado to the side of his plate remarking that \"it didn't belong there.\" And while I thought it was okay I still have to agree with him and in hindsight would leave it out. I did measure the soy sauce/broth mixture but the remaining ingredients I just played by ear to suit my tastes probably using more chicken and mushrooms than called for and less avocado and green onion. I actually liked that the meat was not marinaded before cooking as sometimes the seasoning can be overwhelming. The seasonings that were combined in advance and added at the end were just right - understated simple but still plenty flavorful.",

The only thing I changed was to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil because it is healthier and used low sodium soy sauce instead of regular soy sauce. It was different but not in a bad way at all! I am really glad I used the low sodium soy sauce though because it would have been too salty otherwise! The low sodium soy gave it just enough flavor and the flavors of the veggies chicken and sauce all blended perfectly. If I change anything at all next time it might be to add a tad more garlic. My husband is an avid avocado and mushroom fan so I thought I couldn't go wrong with this one. I was right! He loved it! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! It will be a repeat for us!",
