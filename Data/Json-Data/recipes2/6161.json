I rinsed the artichoke hearts & the pimintoes separately under cold water to get rid of any excess salt. You should make sure they're drained well so the dip isn't watery. I substituted 1 tsp garlic powder for the diced garlic. Finally I didn't bother with the tomato & scallion garnish although I'm sure it would have added some nice color. The main point though is that I doubled the recipe (using a total of only 1 cup mayo when doubling it) & it was a huge success at a party I attended last night. People told me it was yummy & I even was askd for the recipe. I asked the hostess after I told her the secret ingredient was feta) whether she thought it might be better with a garlic & herb feta or a tomato & basil flavored one. She said it was perfect the way it was.",
