The baking time is a little short, recommend a \"Cook Time\" of about 25 minutes, instead of 20. Besides that, these are wonderful low-fat muffins that I adore! The only things I can think of that threw people off were cook time and maybe the title, since it didn't say bran or raisin anywhere in it! (Another reviwer mentioned that too). Anyway, if you are going to bake these muffins, give it a try because the last thing you'll be is disapointed!",

I do think the title is a bit misleading considering these are more like pineapple-bran muffins. If you are expecting pineapple muffins you might be slightly disapointed. Also for those of you who claimed that the muffins were tasteless I would recommend 1 cup 2% milk instead of the non-fat skim option. That will make your muffin richer. Also for the 3 tablespoons applesauce use three tablespoons unsalted butter. Personally I think the muffins are also fine as written. I might also consider elimanating the 1/2 cup crushed pineapple drained and simply making raisin-bran muffins and adding a few more rasins then what was provided in the cereal. Also for a muffin with more flavors try addind a little sweetend coconut! If you are thinking about making this recipe take into consideration what I said but don't let the other reviews discourage you from making these muffins! You will not be disapointed!",

These sounded like they had the potential to work but there are several problems with the recipe. First do NOT use paper liners. Half of the finished muffin sticks to the liner and it's a mess when unwrapped. Second this recipe lacks flavor. It needs some salt sugar maybe some vanilla and some type of spice cinnamon maybe to amp it up. The muffins as made were very bland. They didn't taste like pineapple or anything else really. The muffins tested done at the 20 minute mark but they were heavy dense and very wet inside. I rarely rate anything lower than 3 stars but I ended up throwing these away. Sorry.",
