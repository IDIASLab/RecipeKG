I don't carry kosher salt at home and only table salt; used 1/4 tsp and it came out fine.  I also only had 2% milk and not whole milk but followed the same measurement of 2 cups; came out fine.   Don't have vanilla beans at home so I added 1 tsp vanilla extract into the milk on the stove; came out fine, too.  This recipe is a keeper!",

If you only have salted butter, then use even less salt!! \n\nVery delicious! I was extremely skeptical of this initially. When I tasted it on its own I thought it tasted too much like vanilla pudding. It wasn't until after I finally chilled it for a few hours and piped it into some choux pastry puffs that I found it very good! \n\nI didn't have actual vanilla beans and used 2 TSP pure extract and it still came out ok. I think that next time I will definitely use either beans or paste. This is a recipe where you will really taste the vanilla you add to it so a better quality one is necessary. \n\nI also did not follow the note to add whipped cream to the pastry cream when piping into cream puffs. It was fine in my cream puffs without the whipping because I didn't cut the puffs open (just piped the cream straight in). If you want the pastry cream to be visible/outside you might want that whipped cream for structure. Otherwise it jiggles around like pudding!",
