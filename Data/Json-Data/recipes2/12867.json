Little splashes of champagne help give this cake a delicate evanescence that is sure to be a show stopper. This is a great cake to serve for birthdays, showers, or for any very special occasion. Guests will rave for the recipe. Keep cake refrigerated.",

Next time I will add less liquid to the cake (1 cup champagne) and less to the frosting.  I would add the butter, champagne, vanilla and cherry juice then add the half and half up to the consistency you want.  Great champagne flavor.",
