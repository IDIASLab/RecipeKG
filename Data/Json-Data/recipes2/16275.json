Removing the heads was easy but it took a few mangled fish before I realized that you can remove the backbone by (a) cutting the fish open along full length of belly i.e. butterflying the fish (b) carefully lifting the backbone by lifting it gently starting with the tail then (c) folding the fish back up before frying. Once I had all that figured out the rest was a piece of cake!",
