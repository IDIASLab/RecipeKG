Because I didn't have time to prep and cut puff pastry, I bought frozen mini phyllo cups.  These were actually perfect and made for bite-sized appetizers.  I would do this again every time!   I also did not cut off the rind of my brie.  It's not necessary and it's totally edible.  Save yourself some time :)\n\nI put the phyllo cups on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper then prepped my cups.\n\nI used probably about 1/4 teaspoon of cranberry sauce  in each.  My brie pieces were about 1/4 to 1/2 inch and I finely crumbled my walnuts and sprinkled them over, since chopped pieces would be too big for the cups.  Topped it off with the coarse sea salt.\n\nI baked these according to the directions on the phyllo cups which was 350 degrees F for about 18-22 minutes until they were golden brown.  The bites were crispy, the flavor was amazing and the clean up was a breeze!   \n\nGreat recipe!!  Wish I would have taken a photo.",
