I added some garlic powder, salt, pepper and parsley for a little extra flavor/color. This was really tasty! Thanks for sharing. :)",

I haven't had any energy to spend time in the kitchen but am sick of take-out (my fiance is too). I had all of the ingredients to make this handy and my fiance and I thought this sounded yummy so we decided to go for it. I must say (despite my mediocre review) this certainly was easy to put together and made for a quick weeknight meal. Unfortunately the end result was VERY dry - and BLAND!!! We even added more bacon grease than called for a few (fresh) garlic cloves and pepper (no salt b/c Parmesan is salty enough). Served bowls of pasta with sliced baugettes slathered with garlic butter (Denyse). The garlic butter was the best part of our meal lol! Although I don't think this is \"terrible \" I won't waste my time making it again. Thanks anyways SusieQ!:-)",

A pound of bacon for a pound of pasta for me was bacon overload. For the 1/4 pound of pasta I cooked for the two of us two slices of bacon was just the right amount. I couldn't resist adding fresh minced garlic and it was a worthy addition. Once ready to serve it was clear it needed a fresh pop of color and some chopped fresh parsley did the trick. We really enjoyed this and Hubs either didn't notice or didn't mind the Parmesan he has always made clear he dislikes! Note: Don't worry if you don't have penne pasta on hand. Just about any type of pasta will work! Tonight for instance I used orecchiette (little ears).",

I gave this recipe 3 stars because as written, the recipe is a little bland. I had to make a few simple adjustments to give this dish some flavor and the end result was appreciated! My adjustments were the following:\n\n*Cooked the bacon to a desired crispiness 1st and drained most of the bacon fat leaving about 1 TBLS in the pan and used 3/4 lb of the bacon (crumbled).\n*Satueed fresh sliced garlic (4 large cloves), 1/8 TSP red pepper flakes, 1 medium Vidalia onion (chopped fine), 1/2 TSP each dried parsley & dried basil in the bacon fat and broken up bacon pieces.\n*Added 1/4 cup white wine (Aldi's Winking Owl Pinot Grigio) to the bacon mixture in the pan. Cooked off the alcohol content.\n*Added 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken stock, the partially boiled spiral pasta (1/2 lb.) and 2 ladles of pasta water to the bacon mixture in the pan. \n*Finished boiling pasta in the pan until pasta was tender and liquid has thickened and partially reduced \n*Turned off the heat & sprinkled 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese on pasta and tossed to blend. \n**BOOM! Dinner Was Devoured!**",
