I did rub the leg with a bit of EVOO and vinegar before adding the garlic (I used fresh - inside and out) and rosemary. I threw some potatoes in during the last hour of cooking, and when I took the roast out to rest, cranked up the oven to 425 to crisp up the potatoes a bit. So delicious!  This made a really nice Sunday night dinner.",

                "reviewBody": "JMO, however, while this treatment produces a nicely moist and flavorful piece of lamb, I felt it fell short  of the special extra touch which justifies a five star rating. The only thing I did differently was to layer the dish with thinly sliced potato & Vidalia onion, a middle layer of thinly sliced tomato and then another of potato & onion (each layer about 3/4\" deep), each treated with some freshly mashed rosemary in EVOO, before placing the lamb on top. Then, like another reviewer, I roasted the veggies at 450 for about 15 minutes while the meat rested. Been preparing lamb this way for several years w/o the rosemary sprigs; this touch is a definite improvement - thanks hkwilkins1. One tip: use large garlic cloves, trimmed into multiple smaller, chisel-tipped spears roughly the size of small cloves to ease insertion and promote flavor transmission.",
