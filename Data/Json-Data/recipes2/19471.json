If I had added a tsp of black pepper I would never have been able to eat this. I am not a black pepper fan. I did put a few shakes in, though. I was almost leary of adding a whole teaspoon of garlic powder, but, I did add it. I really like garlic/garlic powder and use it quite a bit. I didn't really taste it all that much while I ate it but there was a bad aftertaste. I'll only add 1/2 tsp next time. I will make this again.  P.S. I just noticed this recipe is for 6 people!?!? LOL! I ate the whole thing!",
