Half of us were chugging glasses of water after a few bites - meanwhile the other half had no complaints. I'd love to make this again but I have to find a way to make it less salty.

Add some summer sausage and crackers and it makes a beautiful presentation. I make them the night before so I cut the amount of spices in half.
