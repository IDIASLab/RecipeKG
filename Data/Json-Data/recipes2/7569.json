I ended up adding another 8 oz tomato sauce at the end to thin it a little. It was a big hit. Our meat eating guest didn't even notice there wasn't any in it. It was perfect for my dad who doesn't like things too spicy. The rest of us passed the ghost pepper powder and the reaper sauce, but we like things crazy hot. Will definitely continue to make this recipe.",
