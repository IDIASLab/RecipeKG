Sift flour over top of batter and fold it under with one of the beaters. Since I had no self-rising flour, I used regular flour and 1/2 tsp baking powder - sift the b.p. over the flour and mix it under, then sift the flour over the batter.\nPut batter in an UNGREASED baking pan or just lightly spray the pan, peferably a spring form. I lined the bottom with wax paper then very lightly sprayed the rim with baking spray (just a tad so the batter wouldn't stick). Bake on middle rack for about 15-17 min. It comes out great. \nLet cake cool in the pan for about 10 min then invert it on a cake rack take off the wax paper and put it right side up on a plate.",
