Ohh my how good they were and how people raved about them.  The filling itself I used only 1 tbsp grand marnier liqueur and found it waaaay to overpowering so I added in a little extra sugar, and a few tbsp of fluff and grated in some nice semi sweet chocolate.  That was good but next I think I'll skip the liqueur and add in some vanilla bean or almond extract.  I would only give 4 stars as is but DIPPED IN CHOCOLATE..they are fabulous.  I bet adding mini choc chips to the stuffing would be great too!  This def is a great recipe that you can experiment with.***update..I now have made with the vanilla bean and/or extract on they are TO DIE FOR!!",

I didn't  understand how the strawberries should be cut from the directions given, so I sliced them in half and piped the cheese over them.  I used neufchatel cheese and shaved half a Hershey's extra dark almond, cranberry, and blueberry chocolate bar into the mixture.  Not having orange liqueur on hand, I replaced it with a teaspoon of vanilla extract and only used 1/4 cup of powdered sugar.  My husband absolutely loved these and said this was the best quick dessert I've ever made!  Thanks!!!",
