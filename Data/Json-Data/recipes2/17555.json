I still love these and just made another batch last night. I don't stale the bread I just use it fresh and the cookies have never been dry. These aren't the pretties cookies ( I have never made them so they turned out beautifully however I am not the \"prettiest\" baker). They are so simple and would be fun to make with small kids who want to learn how to bake. Some people said they didn't like how they tasted I always thought they tasted like a chewy coconut nougat candy bar. I'm considering trying something new. I'm considering mashing the bread milk and coconut all together to form a thick paste then forming that into half-inch tall coin shaped cookies. I did that with one last night (unintentionally because my hands were covered in gunk and it ripped the bread apart) and it turned out great and not runny like the other ones.",
