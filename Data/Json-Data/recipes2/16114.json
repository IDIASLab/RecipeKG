Now - much better (but technically, a different recipe altogether).  My friend (and boyfriend) still wasn't fond of the thick texture but I enjoyed it with the changes made.",

The end result was a pleasant surprise! This was fresh and fruity tasting and not as bogged down by the slightly sour tang of yogurt as some smoothies can be. I added a little honey to sweeten it up and this time Hubs actually commented on how \"really good\" this was without my prompting him. (Hmmm I have to remember that - frozen fruit and LOTS of it more milk and less yogurt) What is particularly nice about this smoothie is that there are no \"exotic\" ingredients you are not likely to have on hand. Smoothies at least for me anyway are something made on the spur of the moment and bananas and strawberries are simple basic ingredients you can always have available in your freezer.",
