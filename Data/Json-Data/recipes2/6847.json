I followed the recipe very closely, only having 2 deviations:  I added 1 tsp. sea salt, and I used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, instead of the more expensive tenderloins.  First of all, I think the recipe has promise, but overall, the mix is just too wet, and the carrot taste is much too prominent.  Back down some on the carrots, even add some fresh parsley and some red pepper flakes, and cut the eggs down to 2.  The loaf had a good aroma while cooking, but the finished product was a bit tame, for me.",

Naturally like all types of meatloaf the opportunity to improvise is available I expect us to experiment with that as well! High in fiber so those not used to this should take notice I loved it.
