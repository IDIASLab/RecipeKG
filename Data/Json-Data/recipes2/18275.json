I used extra ketchup and bbq sauce since I didn't use the tomato soup. Instead of Worshirshire sauce I used balsamic vinegar for a good zing...and added chopped garlic to the sauce as well. As another reviewer suggested I used wheat germ instead of bread crumbs (now I think I will do that w/ every recipe that calls for bread crumbs for the health benefits!). Everyone liked this one!",

Used A-1 on top because ketchup & bbq sauce are high in sugar. Kids ate it with ketchup on top the whole family raved about it. It was moist & delish! Thanks for the recipe!",

Instead of using the seasoned breadcrumbs I used a cup and a half of cooked white rice. Also I did not have the tomato soup so I used a can of no salt tomato sauce. Using the rice instead of breadcrumbs made it a little harder to handle so I just put the mixture in the pan and then shaped the loaf. I made the sauce for the top just as stated but with the tomato sauce and I added Parmesan shaker cheese to the tomato sauce. This helps thicken the tomato sauce and adds a little zing.
