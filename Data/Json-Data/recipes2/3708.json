However, what I would suggest is that after taking the coconut milk cans out of the fridge after being chilled overnight, I would use just the solid creamy part of the milk and disgard the liquid it got separated from. It would just make the ice cream more creamier, but that's just my opinion. Also, I just used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the dark chocolate bar and it still turns out good. One change can be made, but it's still a good and simple recipe on it's own =D",
