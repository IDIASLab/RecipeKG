It was basically like a hash with hamburger, ham and bacon, which wasn't terrible (although the hamburger tasted out of place to me). The BBQ-RANCH mix didn't do the dish any favors (and my family loves them both, separately anyway). My husband ate his, but the kids and I passed after a couple bites. He took the rest to work and some of his (single male) coworkers liked it, so maybe it's more of a bachelor dish. Sorry!",
