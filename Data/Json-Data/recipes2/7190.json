Always use coconut oil or other appropriate high heat oil. Olive oil should not be heated to this degree. The first time we made this in the skillet as the recipe called for. Trying to get the chicken all the way cooked resulted in a burnt disaster for both chicken and pan. The chicken was cooked the coating burnt the pan burnt. Not one to give up we made it again but this time we cooked it in an oven safe skillet for 3 minutes a side to brown the coating then finished it in a 350 oven for 30 minutes. This was perfect. We had a nice crunchy coating and moist completely cooked chicken. We'll make it again oven finishing it.",
