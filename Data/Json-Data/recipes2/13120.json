First time trying it too. I used unsweetened vanilla soy milk. After it was hot enough for me I added the tea mixture plus some agave nectar to sweeten and a small amount of vanilla extract. I let it continue to warm until all was incorporated not the full 5 min. It seems like this would be very good chilled with ice in the warmer weather; will have to try that. Thanks for this good and healthful recipe idea!",
