He graciously gave me this simple but elegant recipe that I've been making for 10 years.  This sauce has a mild sweet taste, a beautiful color and tastes delicious with delicate game meats such as grouse, pheasant or quail.  Serve with wild rice pilaf and it's perfect for company.",

First of all we took the meat off the bones and \"bled\" it to get rid of the game-y taste (just soak in salted water overnight in the fridge). When I cooked this the next night and let him taste a piece before dinner he said \"Oh my God that's the best thing I've ever eaten.\" In other words we loved this recipe! It compliments the game bird perfectly. I cooked it exactly like it's written and I honestly can't wait to make it again.",

Everyone loved this preparation so I'll probably be expected to go to achieve this level of flavor and sophistication for future game birds. I did not soak them in buttermilk. I doubled the sauce and simmered the birds covered for about 15 minutes after a quick browning. Used apricot preserves and extra garlic which I reintroduced with the bird pieces. Next time I will probably salt and pepper the partridge before cooking. Excellent recipe!",
