My kids put whipped cream on them and ate them for breakfast. Will definitely make again!",

I also upped the spice by about 1/4 as a few reviews before said it tasted bland. It turned out wonderful! It was very much like a bite-size pumpkin pie and I served with light whipped cream on top instead of icing. Found it to be a little high on calories for a 'health' snack but for a dessert under 400 isn't too bad and that's what I ate it as. Thanks for the unique and relatively healthy recipe!",

After the first time I made it I realized that it was more like pumpkin pie. Just leave it in the pie pan and serve with whipped cream instead which was better than the too sweet icing in the recipe. I made it again last Thanksgiving and offered it and a bakery pie and this one was preferred. I only use sugar so I don't know if Splenda works well or not. I made it again today for Thanksgiving and replaced 2 of the eggs with Eggbeaters. We didn't see any difference. I didn't bother buying the \"real\" pumpkin pie and it wasn't missed at all.",

I'm trying to eat \"heart healthy\" so the low sugar - high protein is great. I did alter a bit - I used 1/2 cup splenda brown sugar blend - and I found it a bit too sweet. Also instead of pumpkin pie spice used 1 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp cloves - plenty spicy not bland at all. I did notice there was no salt and I added 1/2 tsp to balance the flavors. Oh and maple sugar? Ended up using maple syrup instead. I don't know whether I'd make it again - unless if needed for gluten free dessert. There's just this after tast when you cook splenda that I don't care for.",
