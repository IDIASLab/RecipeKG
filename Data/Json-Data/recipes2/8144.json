The measurement for 1 small onion is subjective so I used about 1/2 cup finely chopped. Thought that was about perfect the meatballs weren't overpowered by an oniony taste. Another tip I was tempted to use an egg to help bind the meatballs but it's not needed the rice did the trick perfectly! Lastly be sure to cook the sauce at least 30 min per the instructions. I kept tasting it along the way to check for any seasoning adjustments and it took about that long for the alcohol to finally dissipate. Overall a fantastic dish with no changes needed. I'll be adding to the rotation. Thanks for a great recipe!",
