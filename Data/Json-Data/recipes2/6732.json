It has a sweet and salty type tang to it. I personally didn't realize how sweet it was going to be and I didn't use much. I prefer my fish cooked with lemon and butter and/or capers. So this wasn't for me but I encourage you to try it if you were interested enough to pull up the recipe!",

In a momentary lapse of judgement (brain fart) I used a whole stick of butter thinking it was a 1/4 cup. As the sauce was reducing I tasted it and was surprised that the butter was so prominant. Ooops. I ended up adding more honey and red pepper flakes and also added a little brown sugar. The end product was just ok by itself but is HEAVENLY when eaten with the fish. Next time I'll use the correct amount of butter. Oh yah I used tilapia since that's what was on hand. Thank you for the recipe this is what we call a \"do-againer\" in our house.",
