Even though it was not difficult to construct with the biscuit dough I tried several methods of pinching and rolling them closed. Most opened up atleast partially during the cooking process. The cresent roll would probably be better presentation wise.",

Heated the sausage covered with water in a sauce pan for 10 minutes over medium heat to cook out a good bit of the far. Cut each sausage into 3 pcs. Used Pillsbury Crescent rolls. Spread 1/2 tsp of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce on the roll.( tsp will run out all over the place) Next added 1/2 slice of Sargentos Pepper Jack on the roll. Then rolled up a piece of sausage in the roll Bake for 9-10 minutes at 375.(400 is too much for the rolls..look at the container) Tastiest game treat I have ever made. The BBQ sauce mellowed out the peppers. Much.. much tastier than a wiener.",
