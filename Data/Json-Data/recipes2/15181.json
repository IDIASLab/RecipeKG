First using five pecans made them just way too big so I used just one pecan. Then I cut the caramels in half and put them on the pecans. Second they were always too hard. So I baked them for just 2 to 2 and a half minutes at 300 degrees... just until they were malable. Then I smoothed the caramels over the pecans with my fingers and let them cool. Third the chocolate was always too tacky it just never firmed up. So I added one eighth of a bar of parafin to the chocolate and dropped a dollop on the caramel/pecans. They turned out perfect! I've made two batches this year so far... one with dark chocolte chips and one with semi-sweet chocolate chips. They were both yummy! Hope this helps others who have had problems with turtles.",

I start with melting 1 bag chocolate chips and add 1/4 bar paraffin for a better handling finished product. 3. On waxed paper spoon half dollar size circles of melted chocolate; position four pecan halves in the chocolate then place in freezer for a half hour. 4. Melt caramels adding one tablespoon of milk or half and half per bag of caramels. Cool caramel mixture until it begins to stiffen again but still stirrable. 5. Using two teaspoons spoon a quarter size dot of caramel on the cold chocolate/pecan bases. Return to freezer for a half hour. 6. Spoon chocolate over the caramel dot making sure the top layer of chocolate completely covers the edges of the caramel and coats the edge of the base chocolate... this way the caramel will not leak out at room temperature. 7. When top chocolate sets up gently remove from baking sheet and allow to come up to room temperature before serving. They store well in a sealed container at room temperature!",

I was pretty annoyed last night for wasting so mucb money on the pecans and caramels just to throw it all out. First tip - for best results - make your OWN caramel to use. If you use hard storebought caramel - your turtles will be hard. Turtles are supposed to have soft yummy caramel but using the store bought squares just doesn't work. Maybe if you found some good quality soft caramels it would - I don't know - I tried kraft and trust me it doesn't work. At 10 minutes of baking - mine were still retaining their shape so I stupidly let them go 2 more minutes. Of course by trhen they looked perfect but when firmed up they were rock hard.",
