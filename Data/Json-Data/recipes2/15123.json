The only advice I have is that when you add the bourbon and corn syrup leave your heat on low.  I had taken the chocolate mixture off the double boiler and when I added the bourbon and corn syrup it hardened the chocolate a little.  I just put it back on the double boiler for a few minutes until it was smooth again and then mixed in the rest of the ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe Cindy!",

I also took hints from several reviews. I soaked my cherries in Captain Morgan Rum. I used the rum from the cherries in the recipe and I chopped my cherries pretty fine and just mixed it all together. The mixture got easier to roll the cooler it got. I ended up just rolling the balls in sugar first then making the balls and then rolling in sugar again...not really to much extra work. My goodness but these are the BEST I have ever made. This recipe is definately going into my Christmas candy recipe box! The would also be wonderfuls at weddings bridal showers etc...FANTASTIC. For the lady that said these were too strong...try a \"virgin\" variety and simply leave out the rum or try them with rum flavoring from the grocery stroe and just don't add as much.I think they would be just as yummy! GREAT RECIPE!!!!:)",
