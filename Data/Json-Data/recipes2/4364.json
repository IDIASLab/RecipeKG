I cooked the sausage with onions and garlic which I just about always add onions and garlic to everything anyway. Also I covered it and baked it 40 minutes then uncovered and baked it an additional 15 minutes. It came out fine and not soggy. I didn't have Mexican cheese so I used what I had which was sharp cheddar. It was really good. I think the next time I'll add some mustard to it as well. Thanks for sharing!",

After baking, I cut them in half and lined the bottom of the pan. After cooking the sausage (I used maple flavor) I added a small white onion and green pepper (both chopped small) to the skillet. I let them cook together for a few minutes before adding the hashbrowns. I also added a few seasonings such as Simply Organic All-Purpose Seasoning, Spike, ceyenne pepper, and black pepper. I did add a few extra eggs and baked at 375. It turned out great!",
