If you re in the States or somewhere you can t get Club House spices I substituted it with a mixture granulated garlic onion rosemary thyme black pepper and pink salt. Came out phenomenal- flavor texture everything about this was amazing. It s (obviously) very filling too- a serving is a serving. 6 servings allowed my family of 6 to take home left overs. I couldn t give this recipe 5 stars in good faith because I didn t use the spice mix that the recipe required but this is overall an amazing recipe.",
