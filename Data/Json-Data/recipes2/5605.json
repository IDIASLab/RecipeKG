I liked the idea of letting everyone top their noodles as they preferred so I set out bowls of shredded veggies (carrots cabbage green onions etc) coarsely crushed peanuts fresh chopped cilantro diced cooked meat (beef chicken or shrimp etc) and a bottle of sriracha sauce for extra flavor and heat. This is a fun meal to serve! Also I have served the noodles in a spicy broth with same toppings. Either way it s wonderful.",

This recipe is perfect for a buffet style meal so everyone can pick and choose the ingredients and their amounts as desired. The sauce is delicious as is then I added a bit of rice vinegar fermented bean paste and hot chilies to the sauce. Thank you for the recipe.",
