I fed them to my three kids plus two of their friends (ages 6 8 7 8 9)... they ate them up but all complained it was too much peanut butter and cinnamon was too strong. The pockets were good and I will try them again... however here are some changes I will try: a little less PB less cinnamon and possibly mix with just a bit of sugar more cheddar in each pouch. I also wonder if it could be better with pie crust? I guess that would be making it less healthy though!",

I would suggest using the peanut butter sparingly as it can easily overpower the delicate flavor of the pear and even the sharpness of the cheddar. Next time I m going to try substituting TJ s cookie butter for the peanut butter. I sprinkled some cinnamon-sugar on the top after they came out of the oven and that added a little sweetness. Easy to make and it was enjoyed for a lazy Saturday breakfast.",

Overall it was ok - my kids liked it but weren't overly excited about it - I don't actually like pear so will probably make it again but with apple instead. I will probably try it with other fillings too - I love the little squares of pastry - super super easy if you are in a rush but like another reviewer suggested I may try making it with my own pie crust recipe. Great base idea though!",
