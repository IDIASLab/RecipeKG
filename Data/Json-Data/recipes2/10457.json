Also cut the cooking time down to 35min. It was wonderful! Unusual to cook the Avocado but tasty never-the-less. This is worth a try if you are looking for an EASY new way to do a tenderloin! (We also used 1/4 of Santa Barbara sauce in place of the 1/4 steak seasoning. Santa B. sauce is a cross between salsa and steak sauce. This seems like a negotiable part of recipe)",
