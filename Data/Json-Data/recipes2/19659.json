This curry recipe is the result of many years of subtle refinements and fine tuning with an interesting Canadian twist! It's worth the effort to find fresh lemon grass and either fresh or freshly frozen kaffir lime leaves. Serve hot with basmati or jasmine rice.",

Used honey instead of maple syrup. Skipped the lime leaves (next time I make it I will add fresh lime juice to finish it). I used hosin sauce instead of fish sauce. Even with all that and being my first Thai curry it was amazing! I also little it simmer for hours which helped thicken it.",
