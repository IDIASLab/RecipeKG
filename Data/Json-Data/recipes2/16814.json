The only things that keep me from rating this higher is the recipe calls for vinegar but what kind?

I will give this recipe another try with a few changes to see how I like it.",

After slicing the eggplant tomatoes and onion (and sweating the eggplant by salting it and letting it sit for 30 minutes then rinsing off the salt) I chopped them up into bite-sized pieces. Needed more butter than the recipe called for but instead I added olive oil... also browned the onions per other reviewers' suggestion. Used less olive oil in the end dish (because I had used some in cooking the eggplant & onion.) I love balsamic vinegar so I used that - it gave the dish an ugly brown color but tasted good. I will make this again - would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.",

The only changes I made were to substitute olive oil for the butter baby eggplant for the eggplant (I used 5) and dessicated (dried & finely chopped) coconut for the flaked coconut - same ingredients just different form so I guess the taste is the same! I wondered too which vinegar to use & went with white. It's delicious!",
