I used about a half cup of feta because I love it and also added a little mayonnaise because my favorite store bought version has a slight mayo taste.  To avoid a trip to the store for sun dried tomato pesto, I attempted to make it myself.  Based on another recipe from this site, I added two sun dried tomatoes (in oil), a few fresh basil leaves, a splash of balsamic vinegar, and about a half teaspoon of garlic paste.  Finally, I added a splash of fat free half and half to thin it out a bit as it was very thick with the added feta. I will definitely make this again and not feel as guilty as when I eat the store bought kind.",

I couldn't find sun-dried tomato pesto so I just used regular. I also threw about 3-4 maritnated artichoke pieces into the food processor as well when blending. Beyond that I agreed with another reviewer that made as directed the dip comes out almost more like a cheese log consistency which would hold up fine to cut veggies but was a little too thick for the pita and bagel chips I had. So I added about 1/4 c each lite sour cream and fat free creamer. This made it more dip like and absolutely addictive. I loved this and so did my company. I gave 4 stars since as is the recipe was too thick in my opinion but the flavor was spot on!",
