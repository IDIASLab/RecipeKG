I normally use 1/2 lb of salad shrimp (from the frozen section) instead of the canned shrimp. Sometimes I'll add a little bit of Old Bay seasoning. One time I did not green onions so I substituted chopped sweet onion and it did not turn out as well. Stick with the green onion. Also when I mix the ingredients I start by combining the mayo and the tuna at the bottom of the bowl so that I can mix it well. Then I add the pasta and other ingredients.",

But once made there was plenty for more! For the dressing I increased mayo to 2 cups then used 1/2 cup Italian Dressing (Bernstein) & 1/2 cup Catalina (you can play around with other dressings too) & I added 1.5 Tablespoons of Old Bay as other's have done. Mixed all together and used 1/2 of the mix on the cooked pasta. Let chill for 3 hrs then added the seafood & the rest of the dressing mix. I only used 1 can of Albacore Tuna (drained) 1 lb of fresh salad shrimp and added a package of immatation crab (shredded). I also added 2-3 cups of shredded Mozzarella cheese. And it does get better each day YUMMY!",
