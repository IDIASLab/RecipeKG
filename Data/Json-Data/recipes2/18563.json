Both my boyfriend and I liked this recipe, but I recommend a few changes.  \nOne: don't drain and rinse the black beans; they don't \"boil\" when there's no liquid in them.  Learned this the hard way, d'oh!\nTwo: They need spices, or they're a wee bit bland.  I added two teaspoons of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of cumin to the artichoke/onion mix.\nThree: I added a chopped red pepper in along with the onions, garlic, and artichokes.  Purely my own taste.\nFour: I recommend grilling these or sauteeing them after you've assembled the burritos.  It keeps them together much better, and gives them  a little crunch (assuming you like that).\n",

I added the diced tomato to the pan during the last few minutes of cooking. With the diced tomato (I used 1.5) the serving size listed here was closer to correct. I also took the suggestion of another reviewer and grilled them on the George Foreman. I then sliced avocados and placed the slices on top of each burrito along with a squirt of lemon juice. After that they were so great! My husband told me it was the best meal he'd had in a long time. Thanks for the keeper!",
