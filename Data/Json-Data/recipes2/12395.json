Just regular pickle juice does the trick.  I know, I had to throw a batch of fried chicken out with that experiment.  Live & learn.",

Not liking the final prep instructions over there I wandered over here to find THIS Pickle chicken. \nGREAT double dip technique. Of course I had to make my own from milk and vinegar and it was even thicker than buttermilk. \nI HIGHLY recommend THIS recipe. But do not let your chicken swim in pickle juice for 24 hours.",

I didn't double dip the thighs because the coating seemed pretty thick and just fried them till done vs going in the oven because I'm more familiar with it. They did have this odd green-yellow hue from soaking in the brine, but the BF commented on how flavorful and juicy they were...so I will have to do this again!! Thank you",

I had never heard prior of using pickle juice, but after tasting deep fried pickles, my mind went crazy. I love my salt, which is bad, but pickle juice  not only marinades, but tenderizes. Great with tough meats. It breaks down the tough muscle meat from the salt and vinegar, while also adding amazing flavor. Great recipe!",
