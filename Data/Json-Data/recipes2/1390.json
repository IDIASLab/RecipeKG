I super simplified this by using a bag a pre-cut frozen tricolor peppers & onions and a bag of pre-cooked pre-sliced Italian sausage. I sauteed the veggies & meat in a large skillet until tender then added in the delicious Classico sauce and stirred it all together until hot & bubbly. I went with Paula's suggestion and only used a bit over half the jar. This recipe takes minimal effort but you get maximum results. I served it with some crusty bread and even though it serves four hubby and I just kind of pigged out. This would also be amazing served over top of some rigatoni.",
