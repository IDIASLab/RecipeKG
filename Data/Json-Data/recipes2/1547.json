Added a little taco seasoning to the cooked chicken and a little to the mixture before cooking. Instead of using canned corn, I used a bag of frozen (keeps from having to drain the can). Used the Rotel as others had suggested instead of salsa. Did not put the Doritos on the bottom, but put them on top for the last 5 minutes of cooking (on top of the cheese when adding it), because it keeps the Doritos nice and crunchy. We all very much enjoyed this!",

My grocery store pulled two of their cooked chickens while I shopped - a great time saver!  I did not use sour cream, but instead used almost a full large can of cream of chicken soup, no cream of mushroom and instead used 1/2 of a big jar of Tostitos Medium Salsa con queso.  I too used the Ro-tel tomatoes but those with lime and cilantro and also added the Mexican shredded cheese. \n\nPlaced about 2 pounds of chicken in bowl, sprinkled with chili powder and a spicy garlic/hot chili blend spice, dried cilantro and then added all of the above.  Lightly sprayed (with olive oil mister) the 13x9 pan and crushed Nacho cheese Doritos.  \n\nFilled with chicken mixture and baked at 350 for about 25 minutes.\n\nRemoved, sprinkled more cheese and topped with additional Doritos (lightly broken) and baked an additional 10 minutes.\n\nServed with a boxed garlic chicken rice pilaf that I added a small can of green chilis to and also used hot chili olive oil for the oil portion needed.\n\nEveryone loved it - so glad I found the recipe.  Will definitely make again.",

The results were delicious my son is a picky eater he actually asked for seconds and this is unusual when I make a new dish so I am reading this recipe a four star but like I said I didn't make it according to their directions",
