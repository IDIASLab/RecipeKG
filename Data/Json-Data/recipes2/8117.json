Also I thought there was no reason to make them \"giant\" so I made them normal sized cookies...started with about 1\" sized balls of dough which I flattened and sugared. These cookies really spread out when baking and made really thin cookies...thin and kind of ugly. Maybe if I had made them giant they would have worked better but I doubt it. They are good but I would not make this recipe again. Also I missed the usual cinnamon which can be spicy itself. So far favorite from this site is Grandma's Ginger Snaps.",
