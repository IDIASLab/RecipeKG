We ate this alongside leftovers of Chef John's Beef Stroganoff and a salad and we were happy campers. The only thing I did different was to use arugula rather than spinach because that's what I had on hand (and I LOVE the little bite of arugula!) and also because I love butter so much I added some to the bottom of the split potato before adding the sauce. Excellent! If you have just two of you to feed one 15 oz jar of Classico Fresh Alfredo Sauce is perfect for several meals. Just check out their recipes! You won't be sorry!",

We grilled up a couple of extra large russet potatoes so I had them ready for this recipe. Being as I only had 2 large potatoes I divided the rest of the recipe in half. Then accidentally used the whole jar of alfredo. It still worked fine! I made the sauce the night before. For some reason as it sat in the fridge it got thinner and not thicker. So this afternoon I made a roux to thicken it and that worked great. My only additions were a pinch of black pepper and garlic powder. I also added a large roma to the sauce in addition to on top. I like tomatoes and the color was pretty mixed in the sauce. My only issue is the saltiness. Although to the submitters credit no salt is added. I just find many bottled sauces salty tasting personally. I liked all of the fresh ingredients added to doctor up a regular or plain alfredo. It would work great on pasta too.",

My first suggestion would be to season your potato before dressing with the sauce (butter salt pepper ect). The second would be to thicken up the sauce with parmesean cheese. Or even better make your own alfredo sauce. I used the brand recommended and im sad to say it was awfully bland. I like a more cream cheese flavored sauce and this was nothing like what i had hoped.",
