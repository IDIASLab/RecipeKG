        "description": "This is a Scandinavian dish. Lutefisk is cod that was was traditionally dried for storage through the winter. Then when it was time to use it, it was soaked in a mixture of lye and water which rehydrated and softened it. The texture is like Jell-O&reg; and will fall apart easily so it needs to be handled carefully.  It is an odd food for sure, fish-flavored Jell-O&reg;, so don't be too critical.  Some people love it, others will hate it. This is just the best way I have found to prepare it.",
