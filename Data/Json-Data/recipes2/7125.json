I am familiar with the dish but I was concerned with the jalapenos peppers this recipe calls for making it too spicy. No worries needed this had just enough \"kick\". I do recommend wearing disposable cooking gloves when you clean the jalapeno peppers to protect yourself from any accidental encounters with their lingering burn! Their aroma alone made it a bit uncomfortable to breath while cleaning and chopping them but oh my they were worth it! I thought the size of the cut vegetable in the end product might be too big but they were perfect! I could not find the Swanson Mexican Tortilla broth anywhere so I just used regular Swanson Chicken broth. Yummy!",

Left out bell pepper because I detest it and didn't have fresh cilantro so used dried but fresh would have been better. Might leave some of the pepper seeds in next time to add a little more heat and would chop the peppers up into slightly smaller pieces but that is purely aesthetics.
