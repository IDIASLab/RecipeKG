I followed the recipe exactly.  So now here's my dilemma, how do I rate it? If I judge it as Quark, it's a complete failure and zero stars. If I judge it as sour cream, it gets a solid 4 stars, it's very good. Although I was not able to make Quark, I now know how to make my own sour cream. Not a total loss there.",

I've made cheese before so I thought it should at least have some solidity when draining the whey through the cheesecloth. I then left the mixture for two days at room temperature; then strained it through the cheesecloth and that did the trick! The taste is kind of bland so I added a little salt for flavor. Now it tastes like soft cheese - great on crackers with toppings like fruit or herbs. So I rated it four stars for taste and texture but only after doing my own thing.",

I strained in cheese cloth squeezed a bit then hung the little ball over the sink. We've been eating it with salty flat pretzels tasty! For other purposes it might need a bit more salt or it could go the other way toward sweet. Thanks for the recipe.",

Now I can be transported back to great memories of my childhood in Germany!  Thank you for this recipe.   I am already making my second batch.",
