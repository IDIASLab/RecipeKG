I think his grandmother made it all the time. He calls it Cabbage and Noodles though so maybe that would make the naming police around here happy?;o) I must say that this makes a lot of cabbage and noodles and I halved the pasta amount. Cabbage is big. I thought it would cook down and it did. Sort of. But unless you have a monster huge skillet and 10 mouths to feed you might want to try halving this recipe. Or quartering it. I don't have a monster huge skillet and everything was spilling out of my biggest skillet. So I spent half my time picking up cabbage and noodles from the floor stove and counter. If you really want to be like me I suppose you could and I'll take it as a compliment.;o) Still I'd reccomend a monster huge skillet or big pot for a full recipe of this. I'm not a fan of bf's cabbage and noodles but he bought a cabbage at the farmer's market and it needed used. It's funny how he buys things I don't like and I end up cooking them to get them out of my fridge...but I digress. Back to cabbage & noodles. Yes it's bland as written. Bf complained that I didn't fry bacon and then cook the cabbage in the bacon grease. Which is apparently what Grandma does. So try that and see if it's more to your taste. Other than that bf ate it. So I'm happy. He's happy. Let's all be happy! Thanks for the recipe!",
