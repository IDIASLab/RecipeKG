But if something tastes like candy...she'll take it! My 4 year old said it was ok but didn't want more than a couple bites. My husband LOVED it...which was a surprise I didn't think he would like anything that sweet. He basically ate the whole bowl. I wasn't a huge fan. It got soggy really fast and I'm wondering if my husband liked it because it was covered in so much butter! Not sure if I will make again. I did make it exactly according to instructions and ingredients.",
