I couldn't stand to lose all those nutrients from the boiled carrots, so I made a standard soup base by sauteeing the onions and carrots for about 8 minutes, then added the garlic, then sauteed for another 3 or so and added the chicken stock.  Boiled for about 15 minutes until carrots were quite tender.  Pureed as indicated, and honestly at this point with a tad more liquid this is an awesome soup on it's own!  I did add extra chicken stock vs milk, and then the herbs - fantastic!  Thank you for sharing this surprisingly wonderful recipe!",
