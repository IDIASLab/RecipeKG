Maybe it was the Chipotle peppers but I had to use 4/1 of the other ingredients and it was still spicy. I used fresh squeezed lime juice and a tad bottled lemon as well as fresh cilantro and lime zest. I don't have a stand blender but my immersion blender handled the job just fine. These are excellent on wings. :)",
