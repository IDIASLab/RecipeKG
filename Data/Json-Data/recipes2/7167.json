I had both red and green chard in my garden, so the red stems are pretty in the soup also.  Just chop them up into 1/4 inch pieces and throw them in to saute with the onions.  The stem pieces are a little bit like celery in texture.  Oh yes, I omitted the flaked coconut because I didn't have any, and also because now the chard stem pieces provided a bit of crunch.",
