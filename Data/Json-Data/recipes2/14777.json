                "reviewBody": "This frosting is amazing but it can be a bit tricky. First you don't need cream milk works fine actually better because you have to cook it longer to get it to thicken. That's one of the keys. Make sure to cook the flour / milk mixture long enough so as not to have that raw flour taste. Then you must cool it COMPLETELY. (I set mine in a bowl of ice and stir it until it's cool although if you plan ahead you can just let it cool on it's own. Cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin.) Second cream the butter and sugar very well. I like a little more vanilla. You can use regular granulated sugar or powdered sugar. Powdered sugar will make a sweeter frosting and granulated sugar will take a little longer to get the sugar dissolved into the butter. Third when you first combine the butter mixture and the flour mixture together it will look weird and lumpy. Keep whipping it. You have to use an electric mixer for this preferably one with a whisk attachment. You eventually will end up with the lightest fluffiest butteriest (I made up that word) frosting ever and it will so be worth the time and effort.",
