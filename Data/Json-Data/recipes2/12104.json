With almond as the dominant flavor and its' soft texture, it reminded me of marzipan.  There is no pumpkin flavor. And this is not an imitation \"Almond joy\" candy bar, although if you added shredded coconut and dipped it in chocolate it probably would be.  I'm inspired to try other flavor variations such as rum extract (instead of almond), walnut butter (instead of almond butter)  and ground walnuts; or vanilla extract with white chocolate peanut butter, ginger and pecans. Chopped dried fruit would also be good, such as craisins. You could also dip these in different flavored chocolate to create a truffle. So many ways to play with this recipe, thanks for the inspiration.",
