I zapped the potatoes in the microwave for 7 minutes before chopping them so they were just right after 10 minutes of simmering. I like a chunkier soup so I removed about 1/3 of the veggies pureed the soup with a stick blender and added the veggies back in; the texture was perfect. One word of caution: Even if you love spicy food (which I do) don't overdo it on the cayenne. I did and although the soup was still delicious the cayenne overpowered the other flavors.",

Wondering if anyone peeled the zucchini or left the skin on?? It tastes great and has wonderful presentation capabilities with the red pepper garnish. And I agree on watching the amount of cayenne:)",
