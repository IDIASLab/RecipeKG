I also used whole wheat panko bread crumbs on top and I had more than enough crumbs left over. I also added a few cups of leftover ham that was in the fridge, which I browned well first.  I had no issues with the texture of the sauce; it was perfectly smooth and creamy. Be sure to stir constantly as you add the milk and while it's thickening.",

Wow... creamy, comforting and fattening.  I did not use garlic powder because even though I love it, it did not sound good in mac and cheese.  The amount of pepper is way off.  The baking time was way off.  It took nearly 45 minutes to get bubbly in the center.  After that I made it so much, using no ground mustard and less pepper 1/4-1/2 t until it tasted good to me.  I also used crushed corn flakes instead of bread crumbs on the top of the casserole and drizzled the whole thing with another 1/2 cup of melted butter.  Definitely use a larger pan if you have one.  This went right to the top of my largest oblong glass dish which is larger that 13x9.",
