        "description": "My mom threw this together for a family gathering one year at the last minute, and it is now the single most requested dish at every gathering...family or not! Wonderful shrimp and pasta salad that satisfies the carb crave and is healthier than some of the other options we have these days. Great for backyard barbecue with friends or a quiet dinner inside with family. Serve chilled. Add vinegar for an extra tang! Feel free to add olives, peppers, or whatever veggies you love. This recipe is very flexible and forgiving.",

I also guess I was in a hurry and mixed the Italian dressing and mayo together and poured it all into the salad but that was fine and probably easier than waiting to add mayonnaise right before serving. I let the salad marinate for about four hours before eating. I liked the combination of Italian dressing (I used my own homemade) and mayo together I've never had a pasta salad that used both. I only had fresh shrimp so I just sauteed in butter with a bit of Old Bay garlic and parsley then let cool before adding to the salad. Of course I took the cook's advice and added in more veggies bell peppers were a nice addition. I will probably make this one again and add in some black olives and cilantro next time.",
