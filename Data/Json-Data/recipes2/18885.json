Next time I'll probably head out to the store and find some leeks or green onions or half the onion. It wasn't clear in the instructions but with the amount of flour I used the bacon fat with a reduced amount of butter for my roux. It lent a nice smokey flavor throughout the sauce. I also used an extra cup of milk based on the reviews saying it was such a thick sauce. It was still very thick. I also didn't have quite enough feta so I added a handful of freshly grated parmesan cheese to compensate. Instead of adding the onion and bacon back to the sauce I reserved it as a garnish. I served the sauce over pasta with blanched green beans and a grape tomato dice. It was a very tasty and filling meal.",
