What's great about this drink is it gets really frothy which makes you think you're drinking bananas and coconut that have been folded into whipped topping. We were divided on this smoothie. The youngest and I really liked it but my oldest did not. I'll make this again if just for me.",

I ended up buying lite coconut cream and using low-fat milk, and getting 2 servings instead of 1. That helped the calorie count some. However, the sugar and saturated fat count is still a kind of high from the coconut milk, even though there is no added sugar in the recipe. I did not know that about coconut milk. The drink doesn't get real thick, but the taste is awesome anyway! I used 5 ice cubes as it did not indicated how many to use. I did enjoy it though. ty",
