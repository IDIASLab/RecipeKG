                "reviewBody": "I liked the flavors in this recipe, but there are problems with the ingredient proportions.  First of all, if I make this again, I will use less pasta and more broccoli.  The broccoli was a welcome addition to the heaviness of the sausage, and I wanted more broccoli and far less pasta.  Secondly, I use non-stick skillets to saute, and 3 Tablespoons of olive oil seemed excessive to me.  I cut back the olive oil to 2 teaspoons,and it was quite enough.  Also, I feel the cooking method could be streamlined.  Three pots are necessary if you prepare the way the recipe suggests.  In addition, the sauce is quite watery, so if your family is accustomed to a thicker sauce, you will need to make some adjustments here.  Since I used Johnsonville hot Italian sausage, the dish was quite flavorful.  I just feel this recipe is not quite ready for prime time.",

Here's what I made: I started with a whole wheat spaghetti. I usually hate wheat pasta, but I didn't even notice that it was wheat, and neither did my husband! I added in turkey sausage, broccoli, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and lots of garlic and herbs. I didn't have any chicken broth, so I made a cream and red pepper puree that I added in to the pan. It was SOOO GOOD. I also made a basil-infused oil that I drizzled over the top. My husband has already asked me to make this again and it's been less than a week. Thanks Johnsonville for the idea!",

I didn't want the sauce thin and soupy as the other reviewers mentioned so I left out the chicken broth altogether. I also added cream cheese as several others mentioned to make a pink sauce a creamy tomato sauce. I swear it's incredibly close to many gourmet dishes I've had in fancy Italian establishes. Being Italian myself I'm very picky. I was truly amazed that this simply delicious meal came together to impress my family and friends so well. I had my doubts all the way up until serving when the sauce finally thickened on the noodles. It's a perfect dish with my two small adjustments based on the other reviews! I would've given 5 stars if it had listed these imperative changes. I also used ziti instead of linguine. It just seemed to fit and hold the sauce better.",
