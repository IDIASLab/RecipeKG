I sprinkled the salmon with the cajun seasoning and cooked on medium heat with olive oil and butter - kind of gave it a nice seared outside then after i flipped it once I drizzled just a bit of orange on each piece of salmon then after the salmon was done I made the orange juice into a glaze type - I poured the fresh squeezed orange juice (I used 2 oranges) into the pan threw a dash of cajun seasoning and I added a few drizzles of honey (to taste)and let it come to a boil then served the glaze with the salmon. My husband said it was wonderful - one of the best salmon recipes he had eaten. I did not use any measurements from this recipe I just did everything to taste or what I thought was \"good enough\" the amount of seasoning that I used gave the fish a really good bite not hot but a good bite. Very good and will make again.",

I didn't have Creole seasoning and I don't even know what's in that so I used chili pepper hot curry powder and Chinese 5 spice powder (very random I know). Then what I thought was an orange in the back of the fridge turned out to be a grapefruit! I just used that anyway although there wasn't enough juice and after a few minutes it was becoming a thick syrup in the pan so I added a little mango nectar the only juice we had. But despite my complete lack of following the recipe the salmon was delicious! It just goes to show this is a very flexible recipe you can use any seasonings and any juice and get great results. I'll definitely try to original version next time though!",

I chopped one clove of fresh garlic and added that next time I will probably cut that in half. I used a Blood Orange for the juice. I also added about 3 Tablespoons of low sodium Soy Sauce to the orange juice. I baked in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes before adding the orange juice and soy sauce mix. Then I baked for about 15 minutes more. Next time I think I will just pour the orange juice on before the whole baking process as the blood orange flavor was very light almost not there. I like my flavors to really pop. Served with plain mashed potatoes and lemon herbed asparagus spears. This was a hit with my family!",
