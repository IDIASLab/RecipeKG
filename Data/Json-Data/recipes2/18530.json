The chorizo is sweet yet mildly spicy, and the cheese complements the mixture of chicken and Mexican sausage. Sometimes, I use a  creamy tasting Mexican cheese instead of Monterey Jack. I serve this with rice and warmed flour tortillas. Add a black bean and corn salad and you have a fabulous meal!",

The Masa really adds to the flavor and texture. The filling was more than I needed to stuff four chicken breasts so I quickly thawed and pounded two more and had six. I will enjoy playing with this one. It would be good with pepper-jack cheese and I can see how different brands of sausage or salsa could really add variety. I served this with Mexican Rice II from this site. Mmmmm!",

                "reviewBody": "Great recipe although I will admit I made changes. I didn't have chorizo and I was looking to use up some chicken breasts and found this recipe. I used two links of cilantro chicken sausage from Whole Foods 1/2 cup Italian cheese blend and 1/2 cup goat cheese. I pounded the chicken breasts down and spread the sausage mixture over top. Rolled them up and let them sit in the fridge until I was ready. Then I rolled them in the masa harina (you don't really need 1 1/2 cups -- 1 cup or less will do) and put them on the lightly oiled cookie sheet and sprayed with Pam. Baked for 20 minutes at 375 degrees and raised temperature to 400 for last 15 minutes and then broiled for a few minutes before serving to get it slightly brown. My son loves chicken although my husband is less inclined to eat chicken and they both loved this. The masa harina forms a crust on the outside that keeps everything moist inside. The sausage and cheese cooked evenly as did the chicken while staying moist. They loved it! I didn't serve it with salsa -- just plain although I think a balsamic reduction would be fantastic with this. Thanks!",
