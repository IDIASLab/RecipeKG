These made for a tasty appetizer for dinner tonight. Word of caution though... please DO NOT saute the crushed garlic for 10 minutes or you will end up with bitter burnt garlic! You only need to saute it for about 30 seconds to 1 minute MAX! These remind me a lot of bruschetta. I'm knocking this 1 star for the bad directions on the garlic but other than that - five star recipe!",

Only negative was directions state to add olive oil to tomato mixture. It wasn t clear if it was plain olive oil or leftover garlic oil from brushing bread. Bottom line- Family and I loved it.",
