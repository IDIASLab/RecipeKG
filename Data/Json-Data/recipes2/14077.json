I did add pepper, parsley, and garlic to the sauce.  Having said this I would like to point out something I didn't understand in the recipe.  Why would you add cooked shrimp and then cook it for 15 min.  I really think that if you followed this part of the recipe you would end up with bad shrimp.  Don't add the shrimp until after you have cooked the sause for 15 min and then just heat them through.   Very simple, easy tasty recipe.",

I used a 1 pound of shrimp but didn't thicken I like I wanted--guess I'm picky. I don't like runny I like real creamy sauces. But I added Konjac glucomannan powder used like cornstarch about 3 teaspoons for doubling the recipe(if your curious I bought the powder from miracle noodle dot com--it's amazing). I cooked the pound of shrimp with 2 tbsp butter 1 tbsp of fresh minced parsley & 1 tbsp minced garlic. Then added it to the cream mixture. But would add more shrimp the next time I make this. I soo will make this again. Flavors in this dish just popped! YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!!!",
