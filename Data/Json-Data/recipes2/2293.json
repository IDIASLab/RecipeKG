The flavours are quite delicate yet the whole outcome is a pleasantly surprising method of combining flavours and textures. The sweet and sour marry very well with the roasted pepper flavour. The crunchy quinoa and onion mixed with the softer textures of the peppers and cranberries seemed to dance around in your mouth; as strange as that may sound. The proportions are well balanced.  This is a great summer salad indeed. Thanks Manella for sharing!  Update:  I have just made this with three colour quinoa and it was nice and looked like a ticker tape parade!  This would be a great salad to take to a Carnival party!  :-)",

I subbed chick peas for cranberries and since I couldn't find my roasted red peppers (they're hiding in the freezer) I subbed grape tomatoes.  I used sweet vidalia onion in place of red onion.  I think that even with the tweaks, the spirit of the recipe survived.  I really enjoyed the lemony-basil  combination with the quinoa.  This recipe will be part of many meals so long as fresh basil is available.  :):)",
