Started the meal off w/ a glass of Sauvignon Blanc pesto bruschetta Asparagus Wrapped in Crisp Prosciutto (from allrecipes) then this fabulous steak recipe & a huge salad w/ Sweet Cherry Soup & Butterball cookies (both are recipes I got from a friend at my cooking forum...Cooking Friends) for dessert. Loved every bite....thanks Ryan Nomura!",
