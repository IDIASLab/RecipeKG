We'll skip to the end of that and say like so many others that it's just not terribly good for pie crust. It's rather chewy and tough. Quite a bit like a pasta noodle actually... So! Since it yielded enough for two crusts and I only made the one pie I realized that it's a very similar consistency to pierogi dough. Since I had quite a bit of squash left over I made squash pierogi from it using a simple pierogi recipe. Added chopped walnuts and nutmeg to the mashed squash to dress up the filling just a little. So delicious! Freeze them and they're probably good for months though they never last long enough to find out in my house. I make this every few weeks now it's a new favorite. Delicious fried up in some butter or served with alfredo like ravioli. Would probably be tastey with other sauces as well.",

I don't think we'll be making the traditional Crisco crusts anymore we just have to make sure we roll this crust thin and not overbake or it'll be hard and chewy.
