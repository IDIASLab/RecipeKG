I made 3 chicken breasts and still have a huge bowl of filling. I am going to try to make several other dishes with it. Tonight - stuffed burgers. Tomorrow - filling on rye bread topped with shrimp or cucumber as an appetizer. It might also be delicious with lamb, fish, or in a pita wrap with lettuce. Experiment with this filling because it is delicious all on its own. Serve with Greek salad or side dish of choice.",

I didn't have any spinach so left that out but will add next time I make it. I baked it in the oven for about 40 minutes. I'd like to try breading it next time. Overall a nice change from what I usually make. I served it with wild rice and steamed asparagus.",
