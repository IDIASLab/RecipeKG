It also is one of the very best if you use really good chicken stock (preferably homemade)and the beef with bones as recommended. The compound stock is very silky do to the gelatin and has outstanding flavor with the other ingredients providing a perfect harmony of taste and texture. If making this I strongly suggest quadrupling the stock and freezing it as I guarantee that you will find other uses for it. My Grandma Li has always made compound stocks but usually uses pork instead of beef . So when she tried her hand at the recipe she made hers with pork instead of beef  which is also great but we like the Chef John's original version best - Brandon, the Twins, Pops, and Aunt Gina\n\nBTW - This deserves much more than 5 Stars but that is all we could give it.",

I had lots of greens in frig so used one 10 oz packages of Kale and 1 pkg Southern Greens from Trader Joe's with eggs, heavy whipping cream and bread. Made meatballs with 1 pound ground beef and one pound ground pork gently turning with a wooden spoon to incorporate. Now don't get mad at me Purists, but had to also use Herbs de Provence because because my Anise had walked away and I thought Herbs de Provence would do fine in the meatballs. Baked meatballs and added just before I served. Couldn't\n find Pastina at the fancy grocery store where I bought the Beef Shank but they did have tiny Italian pasta Alphabet things so added those. Strongly recommend using baking sheet for meatballs-used Foil and it was a mess until I rescued the meatballs to a baking pan. Since I am the only one here who loves pasta, now I have lots of meatballs for pasta which I will make and enjoy in secret.",
