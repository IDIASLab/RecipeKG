The remoulade sauce is inspired by New Orleans cooking, and you can adjust the spice levels with more or less horseradish and Louisiana-style hot sauce. Crisp French fries make a great side, but you can go lighter with marinated green bean salad.",

There are a couple of discrepancies in the recipe which I am going to point out so that hopefully it helps anyone reading this prior to making it. Four cakes is really all you are going to get so keep that in mind. As you get to step 3 and start assembling your cake mixture it calls to add mustard, paprika, and cayenne. The mustard actually goes in the sauce and it is the Old Bay that goes in the cake mixture. The paprika and cayenne are not on the ingredient list so I winged it and used 1 teaspoon of paprika and a dash of cayenne and that was perfect. I also only ended up needing 1 cup of breadcrumbs and the y held together great. My husband and I both loved these and this is one I will make often. The remoulade is amazing!",

The 2nd time I made a few small changes: 1) instead of mayo and horseradish I used the wasabi mayo from Trader Joes quantity same skip the horseradish. 2) I used Siracha for the hot sauce since I like mine spicy 3) I skipped the garlic granules used fresh minced garlic instead (1 clove). Again the remoulade came out wonderful we all loved it. Thanks for sharing.",

While the cake mixture is the perfect balance between wet-to-dry ingredients I think these would benefit from using fresh lump crab meat as opposed to canned. Canned crab to me just doesn't have the same flavor as fresh. I really enjoyed the remoulade sauce. NOTE: Step 3 calls for paprika & cayenne but they are not listed in the ingredients. I used 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/4 tsp cayenne and it worked well.",

I mixed some crushed Ritz crackers into the bread crumbs and I used panko for the bread crumbs. I added a tiny splash of Worcestershire sauce and a tiny bit of Dijon mustard as well. Loved how the panko breaded the crabcakes. Panko is made from a Japanese bread that doesn't soak up a ton of oil so the cakes themselves were not at all oily. LOVED the remoulade as well -- we consider ourselves fairly versed in Cajun/NOLA cooking and while this is a bit different from what you'd find there it is truly very delicious. I added one dill pickle spear diced. Really and truly a perfect recipe. And Ballpark buns are delicious. Thanks Ballpark!!",
