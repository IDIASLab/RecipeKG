Used reduced sodium soy sauce. My daughter ate the red pepper so I threw in some sliced carrots. Any veggies will do. It was lacking a little in flavor until I shook in some powdered chicken bouillon granules. Topped with nuts and green onion. My hubby doesn't like nuts in his food and my daughter likes extra in hers (no problem). Served over brown rice. You can even buy the veggies already pre-cut to cut prep time. A keeper for sure!",
