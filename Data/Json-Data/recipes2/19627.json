Too rainy to grill so I brushed flatbread with olive oil topped with sliced sausage and some feta cheese (Monterey jack for my son who dislikes feta) and broiled just until bread was lightly browned and sausage warmed. Salsa was yummy but I think I d make it a couple of hours ahead next time to let the flavours blend a bit more.",

I add a finely chopped and seeded jalape\u00f1o only use 2 thinly sliced green onion s and 1 clove chopped garlic. I find it needs a little more salt and pepper as well. The salsa is also great with tortilla chips as a dip. Hope you enjoy we do!",
