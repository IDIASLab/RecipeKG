The fresh blueberries held their shape pretty well in the bars so they'll pop in your mouth. I used sunflower kernels instead of seeds (it's what I had on hand) but otherwise followed the recipe. In the future I might try cutting back on the mashed banana a bit maybe 1/4 cup to see if that'll firm them up a bit because I'd prefer a bar that I don't have to eat with a fork (although some might say it's worth the effort!). I cut into 12 bars rather than 9 and I would make these again. Thanks for a new breakfast treat.",
