BUT... since it gave me such a great flash-back to many wonderful moments in the past, this recipe quickly wins back that half-point.\n\nI had to make this... Not bad at all.  I think the ranch-style beans is what brought this recipe to the top of the pile of other recipes I have tried. (Funny, but I never considered this as the missing ingredient...) I used Penzey's Bold Taco seasoning for the first time, too. The flavors were definitely there, but I do prefer the Indian tacos in which the dough is a yeast-raised dough. Somehow, that seems to fry up even better!  Probably because it makes this entire dish taste like a fabulously wonderful, savory donut. (I use all-purpose flour rather than self-rising, add sugar to make a slightly sweet dough, and used peanut oil or good ol' lard to deep-fry 'em all up!)\n\nMy next favorite version of this recipe is just the deep-fried dough (yeast-raised!) smothered with a dried wild blueberry sauce (Standing Rock Tribe, Sioux Nation of the Dakotas). That was served on Thursdays when I was working at For Yates, ND.\n\nThank you very much, Melanie2008, for bringing back such wonderful memories of great food as well as great fellowship.",
