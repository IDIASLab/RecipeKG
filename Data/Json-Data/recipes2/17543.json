All the other eggplant recipes I have tried the eggplant comes out mushy.  This is EXCELLENT!  I used lowfat mayo and seasoned my own breadcrumbs.  They came out nice and brown in the oven and not at all mushy. After they were done browning, I put a little bit of marinara and low fat mozzerella over each one and then put them under the broiler. Yummy! Thanks Pauline for a great recipe!",
