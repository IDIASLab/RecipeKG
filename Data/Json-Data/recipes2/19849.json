It calls for 1/4 c. shredded coconut(leave out if don't like), but it gives a nice flavor and sweetness to this, 1 c. sour cream or enough to moisten, 1 c. grapes halved, 1 c. mandarin oranges drained( I use more), 1 c. mini marshmellows and 1 c. crushed pineapple drained. Double for large crowds. You can basically add the fruits you like and mix with sour cream until your liking. I think the cherries is a great addition!We especially like this in the summer months but get cravings for it year round! My daughter begs me to make this all the time! This recipe is so close to this and that is why I gave it 5*. I think any way you make will be great! Thanks Tina for sharing!",

She said she added all the ingredients except the marshmallows(add them before serving if you don't like mush) and let it set overnight to combine the flavors (and to take away the tang from the sour cream). I tried it at home and used fatfree sour cream with the same results.  I also added a little of the cherry juice.  Great recipe, Thanks!",

The sour cream dressing is wonderful, not too sweet or heavy. Sometimes I add just a touch of orange or lemon extract to the sour cream.I usually halve it, then use very few marshmallows (too sweet). Sometimes I add a banana or two and leave out the marshmallows completely. Thanks Tina.This is delish!",

She recently passed away and I was trying to think of what all we use to put in it and I knew we used marshmellows, cherries, sour cream, canned pineapples and something else. I got on here to see if I could find one similar to hers. Back then they did not have mandarin (spelling?) oranges canned and I think (????) she used fresh oranges and possibly canned pears too. We would add cherry juice to the mixture for a colorful dish and would hold off on the marshmellows until it was about and hour before it was served otherwise it would become mushy. Sprinkly some chopped pecans or walnuts on top. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe so that I too can make this fabulous fruit salad that sound disgusting because of sour cream but is truly refreshing and oh so easy to make!",
