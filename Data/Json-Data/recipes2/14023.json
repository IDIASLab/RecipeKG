I only used less than 3/4 cups of confectioners' sugar if not it would have been way too sweet. I added a little more walnuts too since I like a nuttier flavor. And I would suggest melting at least 400-500g of chocolate. I did not prepare enough and had to rummage my cupboards for leftover pieces of couverture. Ended up having an assortment of bonbons which wasn't bad.",

To the other I added orange zest orange extract and crushed vanilla wafers. I laid pairs of pecans set side by side on wax-paper covered cookie sheets and set the balls of chilled filling on top of the nuts. The orange ones were covered (drizzle with a spoon don't dip) in white chocolate the rum maple with dark chocolate. Everyone said they tasted like fancy store truffles! Very easy to make.",
