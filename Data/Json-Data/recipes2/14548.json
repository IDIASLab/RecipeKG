It does have a very similar taste and texture to real egg salad but does not have the same depth. I still prefer real egg salad but glad I tried this as an alternative. I did not pulse the tofu through the food processor but instead broke it up into chunks and folded it with the processed mixture. I did season with salt pepper and paprika.
