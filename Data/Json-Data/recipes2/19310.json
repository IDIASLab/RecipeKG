A couple things I do differently....I always shred my chicken instead of cubing it - I really think it improves the dish and I spoon some of the soup mixture on top of the chicken inside of the tortillas then spread the rest of the soup mix on top.  Awesome meal with some mexican rice and a simple salad.",
