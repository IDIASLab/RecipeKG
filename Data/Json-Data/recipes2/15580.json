I wasn't sure what type of chili sauce to use. I used Sriracha which is pretty darn hot. This may have contributed to the overall saltiness of the finished product too not sure. Anyway marinating the steak overnight (24 hours) produced a slightly too salty slightly too spicy but overwhelmingly tasty steak! Less marinating could reduce the saltiness and spicyness but I'm afraid it would be at the expense of it's tenderness. As I'm quite happy with it the way it is I don't think I'll chance it:o) Update: I've found that adding 1/4 cup of Thai Sweet Chili Sauce to the marinade then marinating it for 24 hrs produces an excellent finished product. It yields a steak that has a balance of spicy sweet and savoury that everyone loves. Caution my friends let marinate for 48 hours and it got allot hotter.",
