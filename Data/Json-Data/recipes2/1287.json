I made it twice: the first time I followed it exactly. The thing about salsa is that it's very subjective and easy to tweak so I gave this five stars even though I found it a little too soupy a little too hot and it was missing something... which I realized was onions and garlic. So I tried it again: draining the tomatoes adding two tablespoons of diced onions a 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder and taking it down to one jalapeno. Success! This is a great recipe to tweak for your own tastes. Love it!",

I made some baked tortilla chips with whole wheat tortillas. So good! I gave hubby a taste and all he could say was WOW! This is a keeper!

I was so tempting to reduce spices or use some fresh garlic. Don't change the spices. I used 1.5 cups of fresh garden tomatoes peeled and chopped and then added a can of petite diced tomatoes to make the 28 oz size. For the jalepenos I used about a 1/2 can drained 4oz size of diced jalepenos. They are already prepared. The salsa was kind of like the restaurant salsa, they serve with chips, if it was completely fresh. I have made a lot of salsas and this one is really good. I put it in my Vitamix on about speed 7 or 8 for 7 seconds. Thanks, Roberto.",

Sometimes I've used 3 jalape\u00f1os and it's overwhelming then I would try 2 and it didn't have enough kick. I think it may just depend on the size and quality of the jalape\u00f1os you get. Otherwise I still love the ease and taste of this recipe and if I'm not so lazy I can get the spice just right by adding 2 jalape\u00f1os and parts of the 3rd until it's just right.",
