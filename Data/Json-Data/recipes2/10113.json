Sadly, I'm left to eat the entire thing by myself, something my waistline regretted before I took my first bite, as my husband finds the very idea of this  concoction to be disturbing.  His loss, my taste buds' gain.  Seriously....it's amazing.  It's the only thing I've eaten today.  I made it for lunch.  I ate it as a snack.  I ate it for dinner.  Odds are I'll finish it off for breakfast.  PHENOMENAL.  The only changes I made were to use the entire 8 oz. of the package of cream cheese and also the full 8 oz. package of krab.  I used imitation crab because I was wary of investing in real crab for this project and to be honest I think the imitation was just as good.  I mixed the ingredients with the mixer so that the imitation crab wouldn't have any chunks, but would just be flaky and lend flavor like real crab.  After I tasted the end result I ended up doubling the sweet chili sauce drizzle.  THIS IS A KEEPER.  I wish my husband was brave enough to try it because there is no way I need to finish this off by myself.  My taste buds, though?  They're relishing in the hedonistic joy of finishing this entire pizza off by myself within the course of a day.",

Every bite was like biting into the center of a rangoon. I cut them into very small squares.  It was the first dish to disappear.\n\nI found the cream cheese mixture impossibly dense, but stuck it out. I did sprinkle a lot of onions on it.  Next time, Ill add half the crab to the mixture, and then sprinkle the rest of it on like a topping with the onions, before covering with cheese and baking.",

I added a little soy sauce & sweet chili sauce to the mix and also topped it with 5 spice broiled shrimp after it was done cooking. In an attempt to \"skip a step\" I bought the wonton strips you find next to the croutons and I accidentally bought flavored ones so I didn't use them next time I'll make sure I buy the plain ones the texture would be a great compliment. Fantastic idea thank you so much for this recipe!! I can't wait to make this again!! I will making this for super bowl. Note: this recipe is fantastic as it is posted but I always seem to add extra stuff thanks again for the recipe! Also I used fat free cream cheese.",
