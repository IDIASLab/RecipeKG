I prefer mine with shrimp for the meat and not all that other stuff. I also disolve a little bit of beef bouillon in water and find it tastier that way(although thats not an authentic way of doing it) I find it lacks flavor with just the soy sauce. Sometimes I splash some fish sauce on it too. You have to play with it and make it to your liking. I do however like my fast food restraunt-bought pancit better than this recipe-or my own recipe for that matter. I dont know what else they put in it but it has tons of flavor.",

I used fresh chicken-boneless tenders pork chops and cut them up and salad shrimp. I bought everything already chopped and that cuts down on the time significantly. I use carrots celery onion and cabbage. I cook the veggies together with soy sauce and cook the meat with soy sauce olive oil and garlic. I soak the rice noodles in a mixture of hot chicken broth and water for about 10 minutes then mix all the things together.. Add more ssoy sauce needed and just keep mixing until everything is well blended. Love it!",
