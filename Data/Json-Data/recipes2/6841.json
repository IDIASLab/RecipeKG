After making the recipe the flavor wasn't quite right for me so I added about 12 oz of cream cheese and that made it soooo good! Next time I think I will skip all the seasonings and just use taco seasoning. Also cut out the mayo reduce the sour cream to 1/2 cup and add 16 oz cream cheese. Finally I love love love green chilies but could not taste them so I'm going to try 2 cans next time. Another thought I had was replacing the can of regular corn with roasted corn. Would give it a smokey kick!",

Use a whisk to mix cream cheese sour cream and taco seasoning. It's so good. I even topped my steak with a hefty dollop. Yum!",
