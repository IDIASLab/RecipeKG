I use pre-cooked frozen baby shrimp, though, which makes preparation easier. Also, try red bell pepper instead of green for a slightly different flavor. Sometimes I add chopped roma tomatoes or sundried tomatoes, or frozen peas and shredded carrots. It turns out different, but delicious, every time. And people at work always think my leftovers look better than their lunch!",

I also cut the butter waayyy down to about 3 1/2 Tbs. and it was plenty. I really like the idea of marinating the shrimp in the butter though I just couldn't bring myself to use that much. I also omitted the onions and green pepper but added a half pound of mushrooms that I sauteed in a bit of olive oil first. After sauteeing the mushrooms I added the shrimp and alfredo sauce to the pan and let that all simmer together while the pasta cooked. I also threw in some dried parsley. Finally I'm sorry but I just could not bring myself to put cumin in this. I just didn't think it would fit my tastes. Thanks:)",
