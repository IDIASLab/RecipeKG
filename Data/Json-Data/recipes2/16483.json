Instead of using rasberries and rasberry sauce for garnish however I used strawberries and strawberry sauce. I also thinly sliced lemons and used them to line the edges of the crepe for decoration. It complimented the lemon filling better than I expected. Just remember that only a little sauce is needed to flavor your crepes. I recommend this recipe to anyone.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great recipe. I tuned down the cream a little to about 2/3 with a little less sugar to about 1 1/4 cups. This was to make the filling a little less fattening (even though I left the whole cream cheese in:) ). It also made it have a more cheesy taste which I personally love. This goes GREAT if added into strawberries! Cut the leaves off the strawberries to make a flat base. Cut the other end about half way to expose the inner hole of the strawberries and pipe in the filling. Garnish with icing sugar to make it look nice. Serve cold as the filling tends to run if it warms up. Absolutely fantastic. I'm going to be experimenting with adding other flavors to the mix instead of just lemon maybe some strawberries themselves or even chocolate. Good recipe though served me well:)",
