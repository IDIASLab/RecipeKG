I put spider ring on finger, and used cute Halloween ribbon instead of twist ties at wrist.   \nHelpful hint:  I bought small size gloves. The popcorn had to be crushed so that it would go into fingers of the glove.  Recommend using a bigger sized glove for ease of filling the fingers.",

The hard part is working the popcorn into the fingers without breaking it up too much (otherwise it covers up the candy corn fingernails).  We used pipe cleaners to close them up, and did not use rings because we couldn't find any in our little town.  Also, we had a hard time finding nonlatex, nonpowder gloves...but again we live in a very small town.  Took me around 2 hours to complete with little helpers.  CUTE little project for Halloween though!!",
