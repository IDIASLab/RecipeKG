I froze half the meat-sauce 'guts', to make later on.\" I combined everything, other than the cooked pasta, and saw how much it was going to be (for only feeding 3 of us, at that!) so I quick divided the meat/corn/sauce (I did use Ragu's old world sauce), putting half in a freezer bag to use again another time. I thought this was pretty good, like a jazzed up Hamburger Helper; my daughter and husband weren't quite as wild about it, saying that they'd have rather eaten actual chili over noodles, rather than it all being mixey-uppey. Chances are, when I thaw the other portion I'll come up w/ something entirely different to do w/ it than prepare this recipe again, but I do have Ragu's recipe submitter to thank at least for giving me a jump-start on a 2nd meal!",
