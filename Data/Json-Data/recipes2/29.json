I had been to a local restaurant recently where they had a delicious horseradish / dijon sauce on their roast beef sliders so I came home and looked for a similar recipe. I thought this had promise but made it with only a cup of mayo (keep all other ingredients the same) and ended up having to add a LOT more of everything else to balance out the flavors. I really wanted something where you could taste the dijon mustard and horseradish but \"as written\" it just tasted like mayonnaise and not much else. I am trying it again but this time only with 1/2 cup mayo and all other ingredients as written so hopefully this time it won't taste like slightly doctored mayonnaise.",
