Use then about a 1/2 cup of extra virgin olive oil in the mixture to smooth it out.  In Greece no one uses mustard so that is up to taste of anyone.  It is best if it sits about 8 hours in fridge and put a piece of loaf bread on top so it will soak up extra moisture from cucumber.  Remove bread before serving.  ",
