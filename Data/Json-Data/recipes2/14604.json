I also added a drizzle of chocolate (and one of white chocolate) for both flavor and aesthetics and used chunky peanut butter mostly because I had it on hand but I'll be using it again; the peanuts added a nice touch. I recommend keeping the drops small - they are very rich - and maybe crushing the corn flakes a little bit to help with that. Also if you have a food scale weigh out the 4 cups (112g) rather than using measuring cups - my friend who cup-measured said he ended up with too few flakes and they turned out runny.",
