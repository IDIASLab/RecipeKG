Our entire family LOVED it!!!  We just finished eating, and I already have requests for it again.  My husband raved about it, something he almost never does, even about his favorite dishes. This dish is not too hot, something I appreciated.  The corn balances the flavor of the peppers very nicely, and the sauce really cools down the hotness of the peppers. I *almost* made this exact to the recipe...there were a couple slight changes.  First, I couldn't find Mexican crema, so I made my own (1 part sour cream to 4 parts light cream).  Also, I only used about half the called for amount of cream cheese.  It was perfect.  I think (for us) the full amount would have been too much. We served this as a topping over chicken breasts that were salted, peppered, and cooked in a skillet, in butter and garlic.  Delicious!!!",

But to my advantage I love to eat and explore. Last weekend I ate tamales de rajas. I loved this and this made me think. Although I didn't want to attempt tamales I wanted to incorporate rajas into my cooking. I found this recipe and to make empanadas. I used the same basic recipe without adding corn. I made the empandada dough added a chuck of Queso Fresco and the rajas to the center and processed with traditional emapanadas. My husband loved this. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us. Because of this recipe my husband will be taking this to his co-workers tomorrow to \"show off\" my cooking skills. AR is my secret - you make me look good. Thanks",

I also added some jalapenos for some heat (Poblanos don't have \"heat\") and some SW seasoning.
