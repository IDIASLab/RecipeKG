I did pound my chicken breasts so that they were an even thickness for even cooking on the grill.  I also quickly pricked some holes in the breasts before pouring the first mixture on them hoping it would seep more flavor in during the short time it sat.  I honestly don't know if that helped, but I followed the recipe exactly, and we loved it!!",
