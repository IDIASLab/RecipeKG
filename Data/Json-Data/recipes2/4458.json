This recipe couldn't be simpler-just measure everything into 1 bowl, mix, add raspberries and bake! No doubt these will be one of the best desserts you have EVER made! I use fresh raspberries out of my garden. I am sure you could use frozen, but perhaps you would need to drain off some of the liquid as to not screw with the proportions of the recipe.

I used semi sweet chocolate chips and extra raspberries. It wasn't until I was reviewing the recipe that I noticed I only used one stick of butter instead of one cup but I don't think it affected the recipe at all and we don't need the extra calories so next time I'm only going to use 1 stick of butter add 1/4 tsp of almond extract and try to reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and see how it goes... We'll definitely make again! Thanks.",
