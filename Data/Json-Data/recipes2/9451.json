Unnecessary when you can use a spoon but it's cute nonetheless.",

Insterestingly a small 2.25 inch diameter glass worked perfectly while a larger 2.75 inch diameter mug did not work using the very same beers and technique. This happened twice so it was not by accident. Evidently a smaller lower level diameter (or small diameter overall) glass helps prevent interface mixing. Also it helps to pour the top as slowly as possible.",
