First of all konbu and dashi are both hard ingredients to understand how to use. There is mention of dashi broth, but the author refers to hondashi, which is basically dashi granules. 1 cup of water + 1 tsp of dashi granules = 1 cup of dashi broth. All in all, I could figure it out because I make ramen from scratch all the time. Try to find some fresh ramen noodles, or you can also find some \"instant\" rice ramen noodles from costco.  As for the tonkatsu, it's usually breaded...pound thin pork cutlets even thinner, dredge in milk/flour/egg/panko, and deep fry 3min per side. Thanks for the recipe!",
