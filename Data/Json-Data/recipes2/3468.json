We got invited over to our neighbors for drinks last night and because I never go anywhere empty handed I whipped this up on the fly. It's always a crowd pleaser and serving it in a red bell pepper is a cute idea and adds that little something extra special. I don't serve it with chips though. I always serve it with thick cut cucumber slices cherry tomatoes baby carrots red pepper slices and celery sticks. It's a healthy snack that's low in fat and really good for you too!",
