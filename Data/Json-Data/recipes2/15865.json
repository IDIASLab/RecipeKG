For one, I left the potatoes cubed, (it seemed too much like shephard's pie with them mashed), and only used four, substituting the other four with sweet potatoes. It sounds odd but it was a big hit considering my husband does not like casserol. I also used fresh vegetables instead of canned and added a little garlic and chili powder to give it a littel extra flavor. I stirred the cheddar cheese in with the mixture rather than having all the hard, burned cheese on top. Great recipe for experimenting. Thanks a lot!",

I beat them with my hand mixer before adding them on top of the meat/vegetable mixture.  I think next time I'm going to try adding some garlic powder to the meat mixture and the potatoes just to give it some extra flavour.  Also, next time I'm going to try just adding the cheddar cheese into the potatoes.  I didn't really enjoy having the hardened cheese on top.  Using canned veggies made this very quick and easy.  Oh yeah - I doubled the meat and was generous with the number of potatoes and then baked it in a small roast pan.  I would make this again.",

I only substituted cream of celery for the mushroom and frozen green beans and corn. This is a versatile dish that you can change up depending on what's in the cabinet and freezer. I would also suggest using can gravy if you have no cream soups. Less sodium. Next time I'll try the boxed potatoes but it was still a pretty quick and easy dish. It helps that I always keep browned and drained ground beef in the freezer.",
