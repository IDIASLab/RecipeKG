I used the Kikomann Teriyake Marinade and Saude which is very thin - I wasn't sure how it would work but it was what I had on hand and it was perfect - no need to buy the expensive fancy marinades!  I did add the garlic powder to the melted butter to ensure spreadability rather than sprinkle it on later and it was perfect!  The teriyaki is enough to add flavor but not scream teriyaki.  I would say if you are looking for a recipe that allows the swordfish to shine through with just a hint of flavor, definitely try this one!  I am actually thinking this might be an interesting try on chicken breast this weekend too!!",
