I have been making this for about 20 years, however, I lay out the rolls, press seams closed and cut diagonal strips on the edges about 1 to 1 1/2 inch I place my ingredients in the center and overlap strips to make a braid then brush with beaten egg.  Excellent presentation and I have served it all over the country with raving reviews.  Very impressive breakfast dish that looks like it takes a lot of time but is ready to eat in minutes.",
