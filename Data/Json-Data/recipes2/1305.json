I never thought that I would be able to make these better than the ones that I had there but this recipe does it.  I was a little worried when reading the recipe beccause I always dredged my food in the flour first, then in the beer batter.  This recipe calls for just the opposite.  So, I compromised, I dredged in the flour then in the batter and then again in the flour.  I cannot believe how crispy this batter was.  Even after sitting on the table for 30 minutes or so the breading was incredibly crisp.  I am going to try using this recipe on fish and shrimp to see if it will remain crisp.  This is definitely my go to fried pickle recip from now on.  Thank you so much for posting.",

My only criticism is that there was too much batter for the amount of pickles specified. I had more pickles than called for and I still had some batter left. This would be a great batter for lots of different items. Served these w/ 'Quesidilla Jalapeno Spread' from here for dipping...Perfect match! My dad, who doesn't care for pickles (or fried food, lol) stopped by and I convinced him to try one...he ended up eating a few more than one, lol,  and said that they had very good flavor and crunch. I will def. be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)",
