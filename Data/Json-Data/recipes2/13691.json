I wanted to make a batch first to see how it tasted before i tried to serve it at a party. my husband and I loved it. I even took 1/2 of the batch put it in a little baking dish topped with some cheese and baked until the cheese was melted. and i served the other half cold. i also noticed that if you will be serving it cold make it the day before you plan to use it. that way it had time for all of the ingredients to mix together. then there wasnt any kind of overpowering taste of anything.",
