I went hunting for a lemon muffin and this pulled up!! so glad that it did, it is a keeper!\nI made these with flax eggs -bc I ran out of eggs- (Flax egg is 1 Tablespoon flax to 2.5 Tablespoons water- and let congeal for a few minutes.)  and kept the rest of the muffin to recipe. I would agree that you can decrease the coconut oil. However, even completing the recipe as is, my 3 children , neighbor and husband all wanted more. We ate the dozen that it made instantly and all saddened to realize these healthy muffins were gone. \nI did go with a slightly different glaze, just because, it was easier for me. I think I will be making some more tomorrow... or maybe tonight.  5 stars if decreased coconut oil.",
