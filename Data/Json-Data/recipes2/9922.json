Great recipe.\n\nChef John does say in his video that the cooking technique he used is not the \"authentic\" method, but it gets the job done, and it's likely that most home cooks will use a variation of his video method.\n\nMy stove is also typical for American stoves and the burners do not generate the blazing BTUs needed for authentic \"stir fry\" cooking method that creates that wonderful caramelization without overcooking lean meats like white meat chicken and most cuts of pork.\n\nTo get a better caramelization without overcooking/drying the meat I use the Chinese meat \"velveting\" technique, and cook the meat separately from the veggies, or rice when doing a fried rice.\n\nVelveting is very simple.  Once you've cut the meat into small cubes, slices, or chopped, then put the meat in a non plastic bowl and a bit of white wine, soy, and the very important corn starch, mix to coat and let it sit for about 15-20 minutes.  The liquids will high salinity will seep into the meat bringing a bit more moisture into it, and the corn starch will create a coating that tempers the high heat of the pan so that the meat cooks nicely yet retains its moistness.  It is a WONDERFUL technique that works.\n\nOnce everything is prepped, heat up your pan with some oil in it.  Don't use EVOO as it has a low smoking point and will burn too quickly with the high heat you need.  Plus, EVOO has a particular flavor that is better suited to salad dressings and low heat saute dishes.\n\nOnce the oil starts to sm",

I seared mushrooms in a cast iron skillet (hint: put in microwave for 30 sec and it will release water that doesn't allow them to brown) also added some bok choy.  Yummy, wish I had left overs. It was a little salty but I think I may have added a bit too much fish sauce. First time using oyster sauce and I love it. Thai basil is a great addition to the recipe. You can get it at your local Asian market.  Thank you, Chef.",

As for the variables, I used chicken breast instead of thighs, a Serrano Pepper (with all seeds) and one little habanero pepper (used 4 seeds), 2 tsp palm sugar, and regular basil. I enjoy a medium spice for the most part at restaurants and the pepper ratio I used worked really well, very spicy but the flavorful kind. It will get you sniffling for sure! Tone down the spice by removing some seeds. I made it last week, and I am making it again this week! A new dinner staple! Thanks Chef John!",

I've always been so intimidated to try cooking Thai cuisine, but, Chef John made this so easy.  I love, love, love Chef John's recipes & his videos are immensely helpful and priceless!  Definitely chop chicken when it's still partially frozen!  I backed off on the fish sauce a bit b/c it just smells so unappetizing and the 1st time I made this I felt like it was all I could taste...only used 1 tsp. of fish sauce and it's perfect for us.  Also, Chef John loooooves spice in his food.  While I love spice, too, the rest of my fam isn't crazy about it, so, use peppers at your own discretion.  I think I use 1 (sometimes only 1/2) serrano pepper, seeded.  This barely makes enough for  3-4.  If making for a bigger crowd then I would double.  Also, make sure you have all of your ingredients prepped & ready since this cooks up FAST.  In his video he actually cooks this in what looks like a cast iron skillet, but, I actually cook it in my wok.  Have made this several times & comes out perfect every time!--thanks, Chef John!!",

Would definitely make again, with additional Thai peppers and possibly bell peppers for colour.\nEdit: 3-4 chilli peppers seems to be right for us (5 was a bit too much, although can handle). Half an orange bell pepper added nice colour to the dish. Take the time to cut up the chicken into smaller than bite sized pieces.",
