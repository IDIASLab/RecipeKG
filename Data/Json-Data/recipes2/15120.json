In addition to the veggies already in the recipe, I add broccoli, spinach, extra peppercorns, an additional bay leaf, and a little tabasco.  Occasionally I'll add cauliflower or any other veggies in season, but definitely the staples above. In order to get it all to fit, I use 1/2 a bunch of celery and 1/2 head of cabbage.  I also use large cans of diced tomatoes (2 usually) and leave the juice in the soup.  I've never had a problem with bland soup this way.    When I serve it, I also add a dash of lime juice.  It really enhances the flavors.  This soup also freezes well.  I'll spend an entire day making several stock pots full at the end of autumn, and then I'm all ready to be snowed in during the winter!  During the winter I'll also serve it with a slice of beer bread.  In the summer I add an extra squeeze of lime juice and let it cool a little longer.",
