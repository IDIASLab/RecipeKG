                "reviewBody": "The general idea of the flavors (potatoes/BlueCheese) sounded great but the recipe is ALL WRONG. Should probably be around 3T. Butter and 3T. Flour and NOT 1/2 cup of each. That would make a very thick sauce or if cooked for 20 minutes I would think a brick. I started the recipe not realizing the measurements and ended up making around a triple batch. The recipe has you cooking the flour for 5 minutes and then after adding the flour cooking an additional 20 minutes. I think the person making the recipe just meant it to be 2 cups of a white sauce and then add blue cheese. If I make this again I would do as above (probaby use 2C milk instead of 1/2 cream) and also add onion to the butter or maybe onion powder. If you add too many seasonings I could see them taking away the mild flavor of the blue cheese (which will be mild once mixed with potatoes). Altogether I like the idea of adding blue cheese for something totally different than what we would normally cook but the recipe is totally wrong. I felt I wasted a lot of Blue Cheese on my first try which is considered a luxury food in our household. I am leaving a 2 star review just for the unique idea of this dish. What a clever idea of adding Blue Cheese to potatoes. Made my mouth water just thinking about it.",

I sauted 2 garlic cloves and 3 shallots in the butter before adding the flour(reduced by 2 tbs.) and cooked for only one minute before adding a pint of half and half. I thinnnnly sliced RAW potatoes and lightly salt and peppered them before pouring over my sauce and crumbs. I baked at 350 for about an hour in a covered ungreased pan. Great recipe Judy!",

                "reviewBody": "I give the recipe 2 stars but my results were definitely 5 star. I had to make way too many changes to it. Just looking at the recipe you can tell something's not right. For one thing 1/2 cup each of butter and flour is WAY too much roux for just 2 cups of liquid. My bechamel would have been a brick! Additionally this recipe needed flair. It has practically no flavoring except the blue cheese. So I sauteed some garlic and Herbs de Provence with the butter to infuse it with a little seasoning (I'm sure any other herbs you like would be fine) before I added the flour and liquids. I doubled the amount of blue cheese added Kosher salt to taste a hit of white pepper and just a pinch of nutmeg to give it that little something that makes you go \"Hmm.\" Remember to always TASTE your sauce and correct the seasonings as necessary. It's too late once your food comes out of the oven! I had a pouch of Simply Potatoes hash browns on hand so I stirred those into the sauce instead of having to cook the potatoes first and it made things MUCH easier on me. Topped off the casserole with panko bread crumbs and the results were mouthwatering. So 2 stars for a decent starting point but I definitely had to change it to make it interesting.",

I used 1/4c butter and 1/4 flour half & half instead of whipping cream and 1 cup of gorgonzola cheese (I like it a little better than blue cheese). I also added salt and pepper to the flour/butter mix. It was not greasy or pasty and we could really taste the cheese. My husband and I both loved it.",

For starters the two main ingredients in the topping are butter and flour. In restaurants oil and flour are heated together to add to sauces as a thinckening agent that has no flavor to ruin the sauce's taste. Right there should be your (and should have been mine) cue that this recipe needs HELP. Not to mention that blue cheese as a salad dressing flavor is very flavorful but actual cheese is not very potent at all...However all that aside this recipe has potential. Reduce the amount of potatoes for sure. Use way less flour or add about 3 times more cream. Add some seasoning besides salt and pepper...garlic thyme oregano SOMETHING. And forget the blue cheese despite the catchy name. Go for a soft crumbly cheese with robust flavor maybe an herb spiced feta. Do all this and although you have a pretty much different recipe you may be able to pull this off. Even with filet mignon as is you will be disappointed.",
