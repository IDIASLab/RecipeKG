Tried serving will grilled pork tenderloin and also w/tortilla chips. Tried adding a touch of sugar ended up adding pre-made salsa to give it more flavor. It still tasted like it needed something else neither me or my husband could figure out what though.",

Unfortunately it didn't turn out to be as good as I anticipated. Nice heat from the garlic chile paste but I think flavor overpowered the perfume of the peaches. The five spice got lost in the mix. Also the salsa was missing the pep that usually comes from onions -- the green onions just aren't peppy enough.",
