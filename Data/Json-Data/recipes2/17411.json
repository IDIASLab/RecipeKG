I added a bit of hot sauce to the enchilada sauce before. I also added a small can of diced tomatoes and green chiles and once the food was served I squeezed a bit of lime over my serving. Overall this is a delicious great meal that you can add different things to (corn black beans onion cilantro and on!) according to what you want/have. I will definitely be making this again!!!!",
