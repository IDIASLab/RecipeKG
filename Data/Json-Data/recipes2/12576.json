I used my own homemade canned blend of hot peppers and Tajin sprinkled on top of the cookies. You do get just a hint of sweetness from honey but the spiciness is the star in this recipe (it s not too spicy). Baked for exactly 12 minutes and they did indeed turn our moist. They do spread out like a pancake so use a large baking sheet and don t position too closely. Texture wise they're somewhere between a firm cookie and cornbread and they'd be a perfect sidekick to a Mexican entree awesome with a margarita and I would put these out on an appetizer table. Culinary Envy thanks for sharing your recipe; we enjoyed your tasty quick-and-easy cornbread cookies.",
