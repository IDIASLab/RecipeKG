I did add chopped fresh spinach and grated parmesan and romano cheese to mine. I am a cheese fanatic! So more cheese makes a dish sing. I was sure to parboil the peppers for about 8 minutes before stuffing them so they would be nice and tender with just a little crunch. You could also microwave the peppers for about \n3 minutes to soften them. I also baked mine covered at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes and an additional 10 minutes uncovered. I am going to eat the rest with a marinara sauce and see how that taste, which shall be fabulous. I say try it and watch how much you will enjoy it.",

I combined the chicken with a can of corn a can of diced greed chilies finely diced onion a can of sliced olives shredded sharp cheddar cheese the bunch of cilantro some lemon pepper cayenne and stuffed them into red bell peppers. No mayo. I baked them at 375 for 30 minutes covered. I removed them and topped them with some shredded pepper jack cheese and returned them to the oven to melt the cheese. Delicious. Next time I will add a can of Rotel tomatoes and a little more cheddar. UPDATE: I made these again tonight with left-over turkey. This time I added the Rotel tomatoes 3 cloves of garlic and also 2 cups of cottage cheese as well as 2 cups of cheddar this time. After baking I topped them with sour cream and diced avocado. Wonderful.",
