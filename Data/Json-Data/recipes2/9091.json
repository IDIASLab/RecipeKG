This recipe combines those ideas, with a tangy-tart braised cabbage that cooks in just a few moments. Cooking the brats with a combination of water and beer, if desired, infuses the sausages with even more flavor. Serve with German mustard and German potato salad on the side.",

I only made a couple of adjustments to the recipe... once the brats were cooked in the beer/water I threw them on the outdoor grill for a few minutes to brown them up and give them come grill marks. The only other change I made was that I skipped the red cabbage and only used green cabbage. I really liked the cabbage mixture and it really added a nice flavor the the bratwurst. Since moving to Georgia from Wisconsin I had a hard time finding \"brat buns\" here in GA. I'm so glad that Ballpark finally has them down here in the south because using a hot dog bun for a bratwurst is just NOT the same!",

I am allergic to hops so instead I added Worcestershire mustard seeds chili flakes S&P. The brats were flavorful and very juicy. I cooked mine in a VERY slow simmer for 10 min on each side. The slaw was acidic with just a hint of sweetness from the brown sugar. I also added a mayo/sriracha mixture to the buns after I toasted them. Since the slaw was acid based I felt it needed a creamy fat to balance it. All in all it was excellent and something I plan to make again.",
