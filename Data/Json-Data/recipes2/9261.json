If you like a sweeter drink with a lot of power behind it this is definitely good. On the down side it tastes a lot like Frangelico on the rocks. My wife and I like little mini martinis or cordials - this would definitely be 5-stars if it was served as one of those. As a full martini however Naples thought it was too sweet and rich - better in a lesser amount as an after dinner cordial (in a cordial glass).",
