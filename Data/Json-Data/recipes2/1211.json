The comments were positive and some asked for the recipe. The dressing is really good. Roasting the vegetable in a oven at 375 for 15 min was the key to a nice flavour from the corn. I used no name frozen corn because of the quantities. I will definitely make again for a smaller group of family or friends for a Bbq and use fresh corn when it is in season. It was a hit!!",

I used bottled roasted red peppers & since I only found the recipes 4 or 5 hours before supper the dressing did not marinate as long as Chef John recommends. Dried basil no fresh herbs hereabouts. But it was still very yummy. It will go into my hot as heck summer sides rotation. Thanks again to Chef John.",

The best thing about this site is that serving sizes can be adjusted and the math is automatically done; extremely helpful. First time made it exactly as printed but added one half of a diced zucchini with fresh ears of corn. Second time did not have fresh ears of corn on hand but did have about 3/4 of a bag of frozen fire- roasted corn which is ab-fab. Defrosted it in a dish on the counter while the dressing was made. And btw dressing did not need to be refrigerated for very long just until it got a little cold which suited us just fine. Decided to saute some onion in the olive oil first for another layer of flavor plus another veggie. Added the zucchini half next then the corn and jarred red roasted peppers b/c we love the roasted flavor of them and it's so easy. Didn't take long at all. Allowed it to cool in a bowl awhile then added the refrigerated dressing. We loved it and ate every bite right away! A truly delicious recipe with just a bit of a kick which can be adjusted to suit one's taste. Also had enough dressing left over to put it on top of steamed broccoli which was just as dee-lish! Will try it next on top of asparagus. Will definitely continue with this one during the summer heat. Thank you Chef John!",
