It makes people wonder and it's funny to watch their expressions as they notice there is something special and different about this potato salad. I didn't give it a 5 because while delicious it was not restaurant material but for home and for anyone that loves potato salad I do recommend this salad. I don't think it's for everyone but everyone in my family did enjoy it.",
