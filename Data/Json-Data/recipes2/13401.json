Too prevent this, I just cut open the peppers and stuffed them with cream cheese, then rolled it up with the salami. This also gives you the chance to seed the peppers, if you want, and kept the presentation a little cleaner.",

Another was to use the vegetable cream cheese instead of plain. But they were fantastic just the way they were use quality salami from the deli.
