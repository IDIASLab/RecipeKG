This was perfect with meatballs on the side for meat lovers and garlic bread. I just made a few changes. I omitted the nutmeg and basil and opted instead for a lil Italian seasoning. I used fresh broccoli instead. I steamed it for 5 minutes in the microwave chopped into tiny pieces and tossed it with a pinch of garlic powder before adding it to the ricotta mixture. This dish was very tasty and very easy to make. It made a beautiful presentation. My husband has asked for it again and my daughter who is almost 1 loved it as well. I'll be making this for my daughters first birthday party since it's perfect to assemble ahead of time and just heat on the big day. A definite keeper.",

To the ricotta I add a four blend cheese you can buy. Mozzarella Provolone Asiago and Romano. It is the provolone that livens the flavor. I suggest sauteing the onions and or garlic in olive oil and adding it to sauce along with the seasonings. (basil)If using ground beef saute first and drain off the excess fat. Nutmeg is OK to add to the cheese mixture but only a dash. One ingredient I've used to stiffen the cheese is Tofu. It does not alter the flavor but keeps the cheese firm.",
