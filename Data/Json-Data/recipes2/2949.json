I followed the recipe to a T, and got a wonderful little pizza, with a crunchy base and a soft middle. It held up well to the toppings I added--and one of the pizzas was a meatlovers, so it had a lot of toppings on it. My family avoids wheat as we do not tolerate it very well, however we digest spelt just fine. I don't think I'll find a better recipe than this one, so I think I'll stop looking! Although I am wondering if this one might lend itself to my grill....we'll see!",

After the dough rises slightly its a good idea to stretch it out relatively thin so you end up with a lighter feeling pizza. It's heavy if you use regular/fast food pizza thickness. You can also make small pizza pockets or eat thirds or halves of individual pizzas.",

I followed the advice from the video and heated it in a cast iron pan on the stovetop before baking and that was a mistake. The crusts burned on the bottom and it was unnecessary anyway since they baked plenty crispy at 475. Next time I'll try using a pizza pan and seeing if they might be a bit chewier that way.",
