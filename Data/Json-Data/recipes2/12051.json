One 3 cups of confectioner's sugar was way too much for our liking. I tasted the icing at 2 cups and it was already much sweeter than expected. 3 cups was just entirely too much (I'm sure there are some out there with a sweet tooth that would love that much just not us.) Two I had issues with the cake falling apart. Every time I cut a slice it would break in half. Definitely a moist cake with good flavor but it just didn't want to stay together. Overall I'd probably make it again and use my own recipe for the icing. I'm also going to search around for a way to help it not fall apart next time. Thanks for the recipe Claire!",
