I was intrigued with adding the dry pasta to the sausage mixture, which is why I decided to give this a try.   Unfortunately it didn\u2019t work well for me.  I was concerned the pasta would absorb a lot of the broth, but I forged ahead anyway.  I put this together just a few hours ahead and by the time I re-heated it, yep, nearly all the broth had been absorbed by the pasta.  I had used a full four cups of broth, but ended up adding another full 14.5 oz. can while re-heating.  The taste was ok, but I preferred it the next day, as the flavors had had more time to develop.  My version yielded 4 large portions, not 2.  If I make this again, I\u2019ll cook the pasta separately and add it when re-heating.",

It still was still good but probably better if you used the right ingredients which is why I rated it 5 stars, not based on my subpar add ins. I like the video because he explained why you need to do certain things so it doesn't appear as a mistake, like cooking the pasta with the sausage. Which is a must. I had bought Panera's small sourdough bread bowls and made a quick salad. A very tasty and filling meal on a cool Autumn evening. You won't be disappointed. I also added a little Ch\u00e8vre on top so it doesn't give you that bloated feeling. Seems to really work...",

My family said it wasn't salty, but I had to use extra broth and water to off-set the Sausage because I thought it would be too salty.  I overcooked the elbow noodles so they were pretty mushy by the time I served the dish.   I also used spinach instead of what was recommended.  I think next time I stick with the recipe exactly as written.  One thing I highly recommend to people like me who are just starting to cook, prepare veggies and things that go into the soup ahead of time before combining them.  I threw the sausage into the oil like the recipe called, but I had to ask my Son-in-Law to cut the onion and celery because I was too busy breaking up the sausage in the pan.  As time goes on I'll get better in my preparation.  This was a \"live and learn\" experiment.",

So, make this recipe and enjoy a hug from an Italian grandmother. UPDATE: I made this 3 months ago and had a good 2 full servings leftover that I put in Tupperware and threw in the freezer. Yesterday, I set it in the fridge to defrost for 24 hours. Tonight, I put it in a saucepan with 1/2 a cup of chicken broth for 15-20 min and it was awesome!
