We use more olive oil, less butter, more artichokes and cook it longer until the artichokes brown lightly - more flavor.  Also we add what's on hand which could be mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes or left-over cooked chicken.  We like pine nuts sprinkled on top at the end. Surprisingly we've never added basil, but now I will try that.",

I used 8 ounces of pasta 2 T. of olive oil and left the butter out entirely. 3 cloves of garlic dried basil instead of fresh and a 12 ounce package of frozen artichoke hearts instead of the canned ones. I added salt and pepper to taste and at the last minute when I mixed everything together with the pasta I added 4 ounces of cream cheese. I served it with parmesan cheese and it was REALLY good. Do be sure to cook the artichokes until they're just starting to brown - the flavor is more intense that way.",
