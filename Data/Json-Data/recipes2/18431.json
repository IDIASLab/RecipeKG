The modifications are for a doubled recipe and was served at a ministry BBQ, had I known that it was going to go over as well as it did I would have actually quadrupled the recipe and still would not have had any left-overs.. \r\n\r\n1) replaced the cheddar cheese with 2 7 oz bags of Sargentos Bistro Blends, one Asiago and roasted garlic and one Sundried Tomato and Basil, The Asiago went in with that sour cream mixture, the other was mixed in with the topping...\r\n\r\nI replaced the bacon with diced pancetta and added 1/4 Walla Walla Sweet Onion and 1 Tsp of minced garlic\r\n\r\nUsed bacon ranch instead of plain ranch...\r\n\r\nReplaced the Parsley with Fresh Chives\r\n\r\nDrizzled the melted butter over the topping rather than mixing it in with the cheese and cornflake mixture...\r\n\r\nI will definitely make this again, but will change a couple of items even further\r\n\r\nI will reduce the amount of cornflakes in the topping and not add them until the last 15 minutes of baking time...\r\n\r\nThe only thing I did not like about this was the layer of grease on the bottom of the dish as it was being served. This could be avoided by using a thin layer of the cornflakes on the bottom of the baking dish to absorb it.\r\n",

Mixed sour cream 1/4 Cup ranch dressing powder and cheese in a small bowl. Poured over potatoes and mixed thoroughly.

I made these last week for a poluck and I tweaked it. I used 2/3 cup fat free sour cream used 2/3 cup fat free sour cream (instead of bottled dressing) and used 2 packets of Ranch dry seasoning mix used 2% cheddar cheese Used the precooked bacon pieces (less calories and fat then fresh bacon)added 3 tbsp's minced garlic to the mix and used Land O Lakes light butter with Canola Oil (in small tub) in place of butter. It tasted a little different then the orginal but was still DELISH!!!!!! Cut the fat & calories by over a 1/3 and there was none left. I have added dill or chives or green onions also to help flavor them up! had many people ask for the recipe. I gave them the original version and mine!",

The ranch/sour cream mixture didn't seem to be enough so the whole dish was dry but maybe boiling the potatoes would have solved that problem. My husband also ate almost all the corn flakes and I didn't realize it until I went to use them so I substituted plain bread crumbs and the topping looked fine.

I still baked it in a 9 by 13 pan though. Maybe the thicker layer of potatoes held the sauce better? I also salted my water for the potatoes sprinkled seasoned salt on them once they were in the pan and added some pepper to the sauce. I was actually a little skeptical of how they'd turn out since the sauce didn't taste that great to me but the flavors really melded together wonderfully to the point that you wouldn't necessarily pinpoint the flavors as being ranch sour cream and cheddar cheese. Also I sprinkled my bacon over the topping to keep it from getting soggy and I used the original amount of topping in spite of increasing everything else. The only thing I would change for next time is decrease the butter in the topping (which was really good) because I ended up with puddles of melted butter in the bottom of the dish. That may be because I measured the 3 cups of cornflakes before crushing them maybe if I'd used more the amount of butter would have been okay.",
