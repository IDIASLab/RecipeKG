I used the spoonable bouillon in hot water as I find it more flavorful. I used basil only not Italian Seasoning just my personal preference. Increased parmesan to 1 1/2 cups. Topped servings with crispy bacon and a small amount of extra parmesan. Other than thisI followed the recipe and it was very flavorful and super easy to make.
