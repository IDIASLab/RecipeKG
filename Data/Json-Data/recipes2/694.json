First of all to get it out of the way: The recipe calls for 2 individual peppers - not 2 cans of peppers. I love chipotles so I used 3 whole peppers along with a little extra adobo sauce and the spiciness was on point. I subbed non fat greek yogurt for the sour cream and next time I think I will also substitute low fat cream cheese instead of full fat. I was able to throw this all in the crock pot during my lunch break and cooked it on low for 5.5 hours. So yummy and easy. I definitely think you can add whatever you want to the chicken I know I will be adding some roasted corn when I have it over cauliflower rice next time... along with cilantro. Gotta have some of that in there.",

This might be too much for some but I love chipotle so it was perfect for me. Also I added one russet potato to make the dish a bit more filling. I would recommend doing this if you eat a lot like I do. I Peeled and chopped the potato and added it into the slow cooker at the same time as the chicken. I have made this dish once with sour cream. This last time I tried Greek yogurt has others have suggested and found that it tastes just as amazing. Finally I added a bag of roasted corn and one chopped tomato with the yogurt and cream cheese. This dish was excellent served with cilantro lime white rice",
