I mixed this and cooked it on low/med-low until hot and bubbly. Added 1 1/2 cups cheese and 1/4 cup hot salsa. It was DELICIOUS!!!!!! Great with my chips and beans! YUM YUM!!",

I did not have cornstarch, so I melted the butter then added sour cream, at this point I also added about 3 oz of cream cheese, when adding cheddar I also added some pepper jack cheese.  I used a twice the salsa called for and also some bottled hot sauce (louisiana type).  This was VERY GOOD!  Thank you again poster.",
