I say \"inspired\" especially because I made plenty of my own mods:\n* 1/3 whole wheat flour * scant 1/2 c brown sugar + scant 1/2 c white sugar * 1/2 c applesauce + 1/4 c melted butter to cut down on fat *  2 whole eggs\n\nThen baked as written, just till they sprung back to the touch.  These were AMAZING.  EXTRAORDINARILY tender.  I glazed half of them with a simpler maple glaze: ~1/4 c powdered sugar + 1 splash of pancake syrup + 1 splash of milk.  I will be making these LOTS AND LOTS.",

Don't take phone calls from your mother-in-law while baking, and make your husband help.  I used mom's doughnut pan, which was likely 1/2 as deep as the recipe calls for. It made 18 tasty doughnuts.  15 min was not quite long enough. I would cut the glaze in 1/2 next time and not let it cool--it was very difficult to frost the doughnuts with hard glaze.  A great recipe despite my numerous deficiencies.",
