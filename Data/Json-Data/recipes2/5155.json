I made a homemade crust that had additional herbs in it and I'm so happy I prebaked the crust on 425 for a few minutes (after brushing lightly with olive oil) because the small amount of extra water from the veggies would have made it very soggy if I didn't pre bake before topping. I am making this again tonight!",

After cutting the sausage I fried it along with cut mushrooms until they were browned and added that to the thinly sliced green peppers and onions on the crust.
