After eating about half of it I added diced tomatoes diced green onion and some feta cheese. My hubby and I thought it was what the salad needed. The salad is very good as written hence my 4-star rating but when I make it again I will be adding my extras. This recipe has been sitting faceless since October 2007. Glad I could give it a face. I served this with Parmesan Crusted Dinner Rolls from AR and we had a very enjoyable meal.",
