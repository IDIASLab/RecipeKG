I did marinade and grill my chicken on a George Foreman grill instead of using rotisserie chicken, which added flavor, so I would suggest that.  I also used about 2 Tblsp of bottled lime juice instead of fresh from a lime.  The flavor was terrific and very much like Qdoba.  I'll be holding onto this recipe!",

I couldn't find the Old El Paso seasoned beans at my local grocery store. So I used regular black beans and added burrito seasoning to them while they were cooking. Overall it was good.
