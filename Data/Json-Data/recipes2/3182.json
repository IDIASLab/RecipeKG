However I have modified it over time...instead of mozzarella cheese I use crumbled feta; I bake the pecans in the oven to give them a little more crunch; and in place of Italian dressing (any dressing works!) I use Brianna's Poppy Seed Dressing. More pear works too and I am thinking about adding mandarin sections (canned) to add some color. This salad is so easy to make and carry the ingredients (even when camping) it is my favorite salad to take to potlucks.",

Made my own by drizzling pecans with pure maple syrup and baked at 350 degrees for around 10 minutes on a baking sheet lined with a silicone liner.  Added shredded asiago cheese instead of mozarella, shredded carrots and left the skin on the pear. I cheated on the dressing by using Renee's ready made \"Ravin Raspberry\" vinegraitte. The tang of the asiago worked well with the sweetness of the pecans.  Family enjoyed this salad.",
