So this is what I made: 4 cups broccoli chopped 2 tbls olive oil 4 cloves garlic (because I knew 2 just wasn't going to cut it) 1 tbls peanuts (didn't have pine nuts on hand) 1 1/2 tbls rice vinegar some paprika and THEN some cayenne (because I can read like a Big Girl). One thing that I did pretty different was that I fried the peanuts and the spices together which I think helped boost the flavor issue. I also ate my dish warm instead of cooling it. It turned out great! I'll definitely eat it again. As for not getting a little bit of everything in one bite I would have to say I found it effective to stab the broccoli at the end and use the top to mop up the peanuts and garlic. Mmm num num.",

Salt helped a bit. I also had to add extra vinegar and oil because there didn't seem to be enough to really coat everything. The pine nuts added a nice texture and I liked the sweetness from the raisins. Both these ingredients make the dish however they tend to sink down to the bottom of the bowl and it's hard to get some in every bite. This recipe is off to a good start however I'd recommend adding more seasonings.",

I decided on this one and hence commenced a ton of outside interruptions that practically guaranteed disaster. The broccoli was overcooked i can't be totally sure of my vinegar to oil proprtion. I did use a smear of hot sesame oil in addition to the olive and vegetable oils. My pinch of cayenne was probably more like a wad. I used slivered almonds instead of pine nuts and didn't have the time to toast them. But at long last i was done and the salad was amazing. The dressing was light and subtle and really enhanced the flavors. I fried some bits of serrano ham and tossed them on top. A keeper!",
