I used Pinot Grigio which really sweetened it up I would suggest using Chardonnay or another dry white wine. I will leave out the marjoram next time as it added a background flavor I really didn't care for. I used 1 T. butter and 1 T. sunflower oil to fry the chicken in. Don't use olive oil or it will smoke and leave you with a really funky taste. The chicken was very moist and tender.",
