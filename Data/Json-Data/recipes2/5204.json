Had a bite around half-way had to add some salt.\" Hovered on giving this 3 stars since I had to jazz it up after tasting it at 30 min. (very /yawn/) but seeing how the cook's note mentions adding salt I would definitely recommend it. Prior to tasting it (and adding salt along w/ a heaping scoop of AR's \"Sarah's Chili Seasoning Mix\") I was completely faithful to the recipe. It's not a chili recipe that'll win awards but w/ a little spice-love and one's usual toppings (our go-to's are cheese Fritos sour cream and occasionally cilantro green onions and Sriracha) it was quite tasty. Thanks to the Scandinavian mom for the recipe!",
