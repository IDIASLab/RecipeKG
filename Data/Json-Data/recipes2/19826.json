Use 3 TABLESPOONS of spices -- I highly recommend Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus. Add a generous pinch of salt, a half tsp pure vanilla extract and a tsp of fresh orange zest. Make two 8 inch pies instead of one 9 inch. Use graham cracker crusts.  Prebake crusts for 5-10 minutes.   Expect pie, not cheesecake.   There is room on top of the baked pies to add a layer of brandied, Gran Marnier infused, or spiced whipped cream just before serving.   This recipe is easy to prepare.",
