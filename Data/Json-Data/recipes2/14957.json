Place a *slightly* smaller saucepan on top.  Boil water on high or and reduce to medium when water comes to a boil.  To make this a less-messy project: Open your bag of marshmallows and place them in a bowl to the right of the dbl-broiler. Place your krispies in a large bowl to the left of the broiler. Place your wax sheet to the left of the krispies, and pick the marshmallows up with a fork, dip in sauce, then roll the caramel around the marshmallow to drip off the excess, roll in krispies, and with your pointer finger, push the marshmallow off of the fork from the bottom. let it cool on the sheet then re-arrange them on a platter once they have cooled.

And I just used about a third stick of margaring and a half can of sweetend condensed milk.  I think if you omitted the margaring and the milk completely the caramel alone would be to thick.  Also, next time I make these I will definitly freeze the marshmallows for an hour first.  They melt quickly in the hot caramel mixture. yummy!",

I have freezed this before and it keeps for about 2 months careful when reheating as it scorches so very easily.",
