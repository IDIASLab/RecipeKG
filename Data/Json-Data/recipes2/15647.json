The first time I saw this recipe was in a Supermoist cake recipe book and I made it according to recipe even with the crushed root beer barrels on top. Today when I made it I added about a tsp. and a half of root beer flavoring concentrate and I made a Cool Whip Topping (1 container Cool Whip 1 small box instant pudding 1 c. milk and one tsp. of vanilla flavoring). This time it was much more float-like and really incredible. Consider my changes if you decide to make this cake. This cake is a real crowd pleaser. The smell of this cake while it's baking is amazing.",

I also made the Cool Whip/vanilla pudding frosting and added a little rootbeer concentrate to that too. Crushed rootbeer barrels on top were great but don't add them too early before serving because they kind of melt in the topping. I was told that I had to make these again.",

The root beer tast is there but subtle. I used 2 9\" round pans put the whipped cream in the middle and frosted the cake with it too.",

I planned to make 1/2 a batch w/a box white cake mix using the other 1/2 for Jello Shot cupcakes so I made the mix according to box directions. Too late i realized I was supposed to use root beer in place of water. I decided to go ahead and make them anyway and simple subbed 3 tsps of root beer extract to a regularly prepared white box cake mix and it worked out great! I already had some butter cream frozen so I simply used that (Butter Cream II from here) w/Root Beer Extract added for flavor. These are a nice change of pace from regular cupcakes and I'll DEF make again (I can't wait to make them in MUGS!). TY for a great recipe!",
