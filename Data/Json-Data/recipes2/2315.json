I had a large roasting pan that required 2 cups of water to which I added  the juice from a can of pineapple rings. OJ would be good too. It's important to re-tent the ham tightly after you baste each time so that the ham steams and remains juicy. I took the foil off the last 30 minutes, basted with the remaining sauce and then put pineapple rings with maraschino cherries on toothpicks all over the ham. Then I got out my basting bulb and used the pan liquid every 15 minutes till it was done. I had a 9.5 lb spiral cut smoked ham. Next time I'll increase the amount of glaze. Maybe even double it since the crust is an excellent flavor. Everyone loved it and asked to take some home.  The contrast of the caramelized crust and glazed pineapple made a beautiful presentation. Served it with Spinach, cranberry & almond salad; loaded baked potatoes, steamed broccoli with lemon zest. You can tell something is good when no one talks! I just heard \"Mmmm....\" while they ate. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!",

It's nice to have a different recipe for ham when you don't want a sweet glaze for ham. I used a 10 LB spiral ham and followed the steps exactly. The only change I made was using about 1.5 tsp anise seed because I could not find whole star anise. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!
