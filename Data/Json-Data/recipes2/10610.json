I realized I just do not care for the chipotle chilis in a can. They have a very dominant taste in food they are added to and I am not sure if some in a can are hotter than others but I apparently bought the hottest kind sold. In the end I added a can of diced petite tomatoes for color and to cut through some of the heat. Lastly I just ended up adding cheese and an avocado directly to the chili to see if that would also help with the heat. It helped some and mellowed out the chipotle flavor a little too. We topped it with lime flavored tortilla chips. I couldn't finish mine even with 2 large iced drinks but it will get eaten in another person's packed lunches.",

I also added a teeny bit of cayenne pepper which makes everything a little more delicious and after serving we realized it wasn't quite spicy enough for us so we added a little Tapatio hot sauce.
