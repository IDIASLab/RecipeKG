        "description": "I had some wonderful asparagus that I found at a farmer's market that I wanted to use as a main dish. I found a recipe for an asparagus casserole that looked intriguing. I didn't have as much fresh asparagus as the recipe called for, so I decided to add green beans to the mix, along with a few other items to really give this casserole a bit more substance. This was the best casserole of any kind that I think I've ever had. My husband hasn't been able to stop eating it either, even the next day!",

First of all there seemed to be too much liquid in the recipe for a 2 quart casserole, and I found that 1 can of soup and 1/2 cup of chicken broth were perfect for us.  I also cut the shredded cheese to one cup and mixed half with the other ingredients and sprinkled the rest on top. Also, due to preference/laziness I cut the asparagus into bite size pieces and mixed the ingredients (except for the onions) rather than layered them.  Still, I want to emphasize that we loved the casserole, and will make regularly.   Thanks!",
