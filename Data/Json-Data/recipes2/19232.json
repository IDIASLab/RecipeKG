You gently scrape the kernels off the cob with a knife, only going about halfway down to the cob.   Then, with the dull side of  knife press down on the cob and extract all the \"milk\" from the cob.   This corn milk is the traditional milk used in the recipe.  You can add some regular cream if necessary. but white corn renders a lot of liquid.   Very delicious when made this way.",
