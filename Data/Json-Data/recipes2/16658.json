It was rich and creamy, and had just the right amount of seasonings that didn't overwhelm the taste of the crab meat.  The only changes I made is I didn't use the mushrooms (I never had crab imperial with mushrooms, and my guests don't like them), and I used red bell pepper instead of the green as my guests don't like them either.  I used it to stuff lobster tails with, adding the crab half way through the cooking (at 350 degrees), then stuck them under the broiler just long enough to get them golden and bubbly.  They're still talking about it.",
