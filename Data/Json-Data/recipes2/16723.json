Before I sauteed them I rubbed the insides with a cut lemon and squeezed the juice from 1/2 of the lemon over the artichokes. I used more olive oil than butter which helps prevent the garlic from getting too dark. I added the juice from the remaining 1/2 lemon to the water or white wine. When serving the artichokes I poured the sauce from the pan over them. Yum! Thank you for this recipe.",

I doubled the butter and garlic the second time I made it and doubled the water for steaming. I also doubled the steam time found it was much more tender that way. I always dip my artichoke in a simple butter and lemon mix. The garlic was a wonderful addition to the flavor! And this week artichokes are on sale. My boyfriend doesn't care for artichokes so I just make this recipe with two artichokes as my complete dinner! Yum yum yum! A definite keeper! I can't wait to visit my folks and cook it for them this way! Thanks for the recipe. I'll also try some of the other suggestions folks have made so far.",

Allrecipes edits the recipes they get and in this case they didn't necessarily do it well. People talk about cooking times and liquid - that all depends on the size of your artichokes. We like them about fist sized which can cook in 20 minutes or so cut in half. You need to think about the size and you need to watch the time and liquid - this is actually almost braising. Often I will add liquid part way through. You can walk away but you can't walk away and forget it either. If you pay attention and watch how they are going this is hard to ruin.
