I then added the ground Chuck and continued with canned roasted tomatoes and spinach. I also added the mozzarella cheese shredded and stirred again.. I added a few more herbs on the top and baked 5 min.. this was a hit in my house! easy to make and fulfilling.. I said next time I will add asparagus tips!",

I was worried it wouldn't have enough liquid so I wound up adding sliced mushrooms as they make their own liquid (I'm sure this was more of a mental thing but I like mushroons so it works).  I found Barilla Plus Bowtie Pasta and it was wonderful. The first time I made it, I kept searching for more of a tomato-y taste and I considered using tomato sauce but then I realized that was silly because I didn't want to hide the Land O'Lakes flavor so I used stewed tomatoes and it was delicious!  When I used pre-shredded mozzarella, it wound up being stringy at first, leftovers it wasn't stringy but I don't know who would cook this and wait to eat it the next day.  I am going to try the little mozzarella balls next.  Anyway, I loved how quickly this came together, I loved all the vegetables (with the mushrooms that's three different colored veggies), and I loved the flavor.  I'm going to try the Garlic and Herb next!",
