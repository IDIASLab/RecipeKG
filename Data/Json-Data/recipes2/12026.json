I used whole grain bread as I wanted to make this as a healthy breakfast for my family however if I was making this simply to indulge tastebuds I would go for slices of french bread and top it all off with generous dollops of spiced whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a good drizzle of maple syrup as suggested. The whole family loved this recipe.",

Even though I stirred the batter though between bread dippings the walnuts tended to slide to the bottom of the batter so that the first pieces of toast had few nuts and the last ones had the bulk of them. To compensate next time I will use a serrated spoon and scoop up some walnut pieces from the batter to sprinkle on the tops of breads as they are lowered onto the griddle. I tried this out toward the end and it worked well.",
