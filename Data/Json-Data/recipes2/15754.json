I also used chopped pecans instead of walnuts. My dump cake was done in just over 30 minutes. I served this slightly warm with dollops of Cool-Whip. My family adored this dessert. Very good. NOTE: If you cut your butter into very thin slices and layer them over the dry cake mix/nut layer, you should have enough to cover the whole dry layer and end up with a topping that looks like a crisp/cobbler. I don't always get the results I want if I melt the butter and drizzle it over.",

If you are thinking of making this be warned that it is not a cake rather more of a dessert (you spoon it into dishes). The woman who said the trick is to cut very thin pieces from a stick of butter and cover the _entire_ top is correct. I did this and didn't have the crumbly problem others mentioned. Instead the top turned out a bit crusty with the gooey cherry stuff underneath. Keep an eye on temp so the top doesn't scorch (my oven runs hot). Serve with whipped cream. (I skipped the nuts; a personal preference.)",
