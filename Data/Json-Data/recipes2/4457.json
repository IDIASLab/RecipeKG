Of course we modify to what we have on hand right? :)\nFirst off I took the stems out and cleaned  the mushroom \"gills\". I then salted the mushroom caps and put on a baking sheet to precook at 350 deg.  \nI chopped the stems and saut\u00e9ed the stems with some garlic and small shrimp just for a minute to incorporate the garlic. \nI put the shrimp mix into a bowl with my imitation crab, some parmesan cheese and panko bread crumbs. I added a Tbspn of mayo and some peppered gouda cheese (had no mozzarella). \nAfter the mushrooms were in oven for about 10 mins I took them out and dryed them off as they had sweat out a lot of moisture. \nI then took my stuffing and mounded it into the caps. I topped the mound with some more panko and sprinkled with olive oil. I baked for about 30 mins and finished with a quick broil to brown the top. \nNext time I will use Mozzarella and more mayo for moisture. \nOverall very good.",
