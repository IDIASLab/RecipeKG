Dude I love spinach!\" I will put spinach in just about anything and don't care if the flavor is masked or not. If I had to have bedding made of a food I would sleep under a blanket of spinach. And it's summertime and me and my girlies just picked a ton of blueberries. This smoothie was an easy-gotta-try this a.m. and while I made it exactly as written after pouring the first glass we didn't like the texture so back in the blender twas dumped. Added a few slices of frozen banana and that helped but it still felt like the consistency of Pepto Bismal (far from the color though phew) so I added more banana some ice cubes splash of almond milk and another handful of blueberries. YES now we have smoothie success. But as written with the ratio of berry spinach protein powder it just didn't jive.",
