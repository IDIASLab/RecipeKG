I prepared as is but when I went to put the honey on the chicken the bacon was not cooked much so I added the honey and turned the oven up to 400 degrees baked 10 more minutes & it came out perfect. Will definitely make again. Only gave 4 stars because it wasn't the best chicken ever but it is excellent & easy.",

We half-way-cooked the bacon before wrapping the chicken. Also once the chicken was wrapped in bacon and placed in the baking dish we sprinkled the bundles with dried thyme and misted them with olive oil. Our chicken pieces were large so they needed about 35 minutes to cook but that was not a problem. We enjoyed the recipe and will use it again in the future.",
