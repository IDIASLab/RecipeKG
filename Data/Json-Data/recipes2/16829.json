I had to use more olive oil and also added butter together because if not it would have been much more dry. I chopped the onion finely and also added more grated cheese and parsley for garnish. While I drained the pasta I added the scrambled egg in the pot that I used for the pasta with the flame off and it cooked very nice and light. Immediately after that I added the pasta and remaining ingredients. lMuch better after that.",

I also used mostaciolli noodles instead of spaghetti. Lastly added fresh ground pepper to the finished dish which was quite good as it adds a nice spicy contrast to the umami flavors of the mushrooms and cheese. I added the egg in with the chicken and onion mushroom mixture instead of the noodles because I left them in the colander in the sink until they were cool. This was a mistake it made the mixture gloopy but it was still quite tasty. If I make again I think I would make without chicken as it seems more of a distraction from the rest of the dish than a good addition.",

When they were done cooking, I added in 1/2 c. of olive oil and heated before adding to the pasta.\n\nI cooked the pasta per box directions, and before draining, I reserved one cup of the pasta cooking liquid.  After draining, I put the pasta back in the pot and stirred in the eggs.  I added the pasta water back in (makes the pasta creamier), and then added in the hot onions/mushroom/garlic and parmesan cheese.\n\nThis was simple and good, a quick meal for the family, not so special or fancy that I would serve for company.
