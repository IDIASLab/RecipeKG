I'm not sure what age this recipe was intended for but my son is 8 months so I used Baby rice cereal and had to thin it out a bit. I used breast milk instead of the milk and homemade apple sauce in place of the juice. I plan to add some cinnamon next time and maybe some vanilla. This recipe makes a lot which is good for busy mornings.",
