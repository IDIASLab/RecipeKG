I made this with red potatos, and left out the onion (just don't care for raw onion) used onion powder instead.  I diced a whole jar of Klaussen(?)pickle spears to make up for the missing onion.(I think that made a difference, they are very crunchy pickles, yum) Everything else was done as the recipes says, I did try a little with some celery seed on top, and really liked that, too.  Not that it needed it, I just love celery seed in my potato salad.  Anyway, this will be my new recipe from now on, so delicious.  Thanks!",

But it was a little nondescript for me so I had to tinker with it. I added the optional dill pickle but I also included some sliced celery for some contrast in texture. To pretty it up a little with some color (and because I hate the aftertaste of raw white onion) I used sliced green onion. The horseradish was a nice addition but so subtle that it was barely noticeable so more could be added with no risk. Rather than salt and pepper I used Jane s Krazy Mixed Up Salt and even more freshly ground pepper. But most important I don t like an overly mayonnaise-y taste so I cut it with sour cream to probably a ratio of 50/50. It needed to be a little gushier so I dribbled in a little half and half and I expect I ll have to again tomorrow before I serve it.",
