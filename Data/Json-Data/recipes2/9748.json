When I go shopping for ingredients I look at the ingredient list therefore I bought coconut cream. I thought it seemed odd that the only \"sweet\" ingredient was sweetened condensed milk. This ice cream lacked flavor except for the rum extract. Also it was way too much pineapple. And you should mention what size of ice cream maker this recipe is for or the amount it makes. My ice cream maker is a 4 quart while I have friends with 6 quart makers. I would think that would make a big difference in flavor...",

I combined all the ingredients in a large bowl (used cream of coconut instead of coconut cream and excluded the coconut flakes and milk) and beat it using a mixer until thoroughly combined. I then folded the coconut flakes into the mixture. In a separate bowl I substituted the milk with heavy cream and beat it until it formed firm peaks. I then slowly folded the coconut mixture into the whipped cream (I slowly poured using a ladle in my left hand and folded with a rubber spatula in right hand). Afterwords I poured it into a container with a lid and put it in the freezer till it turned hard. (It took mine somewhere between 12 and 20 hours but I poured it into 1 container instead of multiple. If you poured it into multiple it should decrease the freezing time. Just check every 4 hrs.) Entire family loved it.",
