I used thighs and breasts, that I had brined in a salt water solution.  They were pretty big so the cook time of 5 - 7 minutes a side wasn't quite long enough.  I preheated the oven to 300 on convection setting and placed a cooling rack over a lined sheet pan.   In my 10\" cast iron skillet I could do 3 pieces at a time without overcrowding.  Starting with the largest pieces of chicken, then as they were done frying, they went onto the rack in the oven while I fried the next batch.   All the chicken was crispy and cooked thoroughly yet still moist.  Thanks!",

What? No salt? Re-read the recipe and I didn't mess up. Brined chicken wasn't specified. I would totally make this again but I'd use onion salt add salt or even seasoning salt. It was still delicious slathered in BBQ sauce so 4 stars!",
