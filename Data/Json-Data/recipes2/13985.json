In a lot of places hash is vinegary - just like barbeque..probably originally the vinegar was like bbq sauce and hot sauce a way to preserve meat or sometimes make less fresh meat palatable. It's an acquired taste so rather than worry about cooking it off just moderate the amount to your own taste. Obviously how long you have to cook the potato depends on how small the slice or dice. Although I'd use left over corned beef or chopped up roast beef. Almost any relatively finely chopped lean meat will work well (fatty meats will make it a mess). A cheap round steak finely chopped would work really well as would a prok chop with the fat trimmed. Heck turkwy makes a fine hash too. I like this recipe becasue you can modify it to what you have on hand and to suit your own tastes.",

I also heeded some of the reviews and used half of the pepper and vinegar. I was expecting the vinegar to be overpowering, but after 20 minutes it was just right.

Please make sure your vinegar is cooked out or it will taste sour. You should be able to smell it while cooking and if you can still smell it it's not totally out! This recipe definitely needed the corn I added. Good though - tried canned Hormel and that was ok but the recipe was good.",
