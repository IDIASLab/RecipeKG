Changes were made because of things I had on hand at the time. The zucchini was a great way to add veggies and fiber. Make a batch or 2 and freeze them for mornings you're in a hurry or just need a snack! Sometimes I'll warm one up in the microwave and drizzle a little agave nectar over it! Yum!",

I substituted truvia brown sugar (6 tablespons) baking mix for the agave. I swapped 1/4 cup of steel cut oats for 1/4 cup of old fashioned oats. I reduced raisins to half cup. In half of the batch I added semi sweet mini chocolate chips (also good for lactation) I swapped out the oil with 1/2 of unsweetened apple sauce. I made 2 trays of mini muffins and a dozen standard size muffins with this recipe. Mini muffins turned out well. I only baked them for 18 minutes. This is not very sweet but very flavourful!",
