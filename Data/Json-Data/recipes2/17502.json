Here's what I suggest for a restaurant quality dish: Cook chorizo over med heat until most of the grease has cooked off (about 10-15 minutes). Drain and return to pan increasing heat to med high. Cook until about 1/2 the meat is charred (about 5 minutes). Shred 8 oz Chihuahua cheese with jalapeno 4 oz reg Chihuahua cheese and 2 oz Cojita cheese in Cuisinart - blend together. Spray 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray. Layer 1/2 of cheese then charred chirizo then top with remaining 1/2 of cheese blend. Cook at 325 for 15 minutes until cheese is mostly melted. Stir around and broil for an additional 5 minutes until top is bubbly. Serve with warmed tortillas tortilla chips or as a savory topping to chicken. DELICIOUS",

I made it for our first Sunday football watching party and it was a big hit. I seasoned the ground beef with a little garlic salt while it cooked and used chicken chorizo from Trader Joe's (less fat and all of the flavor). This turned out like a layered dip. I think I'll add more cheese next time and mix everything up. Really though a great alternative to bringing a seven layer bean dip.",
