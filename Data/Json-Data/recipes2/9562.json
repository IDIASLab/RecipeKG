I personally just felt it was the right call. I am in no way a vegetarian but feel it necessary to point out that most all of the refried  beans you buy in the store are made with lard. Again, I have no issues eating lard but it is not vegetarian. You'd need to buy special beans or make your own if you are a vegetarian.  These were good and I will most definitely make them again.

Tasty and satisfying.\nServes 5 or 6, instead of the 4 mentioned.\nFound in markets since you wrote recipe various products with jalapenos (cheese, corn chips), so had option of using regular salsa and omitting separate jalapenos.\nAm using sour cream or avocado as garnish.\nAnother comment noted that most canned refried beans are NOT vegetarian. So can use home made refried, or plain canned red beans.",
