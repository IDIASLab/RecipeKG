He sent us his recipe and we tweaked it a bit to suit our tastes. It's an easy one-dish meal that's made complete with a simple salad. Our favorite part of the original recipe that we received was the last line that said \"eat the whole dish and take a nap!\"",

                "reviewBody": "Simple enough but knew I'd be changing some things. Adding all the liquid from the canned goods only increased the salt content. I'm good with grn beans, but opted for corn. Added 1/2Tbl Worcestershire after draining meat, frzn corn (any frzn veggies will work), drained the olives used 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can tomatoes with diced chilis. Adjust your spices bcuz you've left out all the brine when draining the canned goods. Pre-bake the bottom Crescent layer. All in all I really liked this. Good flavor, and if you pre drain what you are able there's nothing to drain before adding your mixture to the baking dish.",
