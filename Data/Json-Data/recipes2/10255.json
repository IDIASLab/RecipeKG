This recipe couldn t be simpler and was a nice change from just good old corned beef hash and eggs. I think there are many variations you could do. I was thinking adding some red pepper flakes to the hash while it s browning adding some chopped parsley to give it a little pop of color or instead of regular cream cheese spreading the dough with some pimento cream cheese spread etc. Would recommend leaving your dough sheets in the fridge until you re ready to fill and roll them. I spread my hash mixture while it was warm which softened the dough making it a little difficult to roll tightly. In the future I ll let the hash cool down a bit more. Really enjoyed the simplicity of this and it was a nice Saturday morning breakfast paired with some fresh fruit.",
