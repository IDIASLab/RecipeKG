I regularly cook for our extended family - up to 21 people (we take turns making dinner every night) - and EVERYONE thought this was to die for!  I use baking for my mental therapy and this was one of my more rewarding quick fixes.  Hope you'll try my suggestions.",

That's the only ingredient change I made to the recipe and it turned out great.  I didn't have the problem that some other reviewers mentioned about the batter being so difficult to mix.  I used my very powerful stand mixer and it was blended in a snap.  I baked it in a bundt pan for 30 minutes, which was adequate, although next time I might add 5 more minutes.  I took it to a ladies Bible study and there were no leftovers.  I didn't frost it, but I think I will make a cream cheese frosting next time ... and there will be a next time.  It's just too easy and too good.",

I wanted to take a moment to thank you for this recipe.  My family and I are living strictly off donations from a food pantry. We often get unusual ingredients and don't know what to do with them.... but no food can go to waste,  everything has to get used.  So many recipes have ingredients that we just don't have,  or have access to. This recipe is two ingredients.   Nothing fancy. If you have more,  you can do more,  but the base recipe will work.  I have a family Christmas party to go to today, and thought I'd have to go empty handed.  This recipe allowed me to make SOMETHING so I could celebrate,  too,  and not hang my head in shame.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe and giving me dignity.",

To the base cake, simply adding two eggs and 1/4 cup of sugar causes the cake to bake into a nice 'dome' shape as most cakes do in a 13 x 9 pan (30 minutes at 350 degrees F).  The cake is enhanced by a super simple glaze:  1/4 cup confectioners sugar, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 2 Tablespoons milk.   Blend and pour over warm cake.  Finally, if you want to take it over the top, put a dollop of whipped cream then a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice to cap it off and you're there.  Incredibly simple and delicious. ",

                "reviewBody": "There are a few reasons why I gave this only 3 stars. The taste of the cake was just ordinary, nothing special. The cake batter was very, very difficult to work with. The recipe said to spread evenly in the 9x13 pan but this batter was like spreading thick peanut butter in a pan that has been greased. It stuck to the spatula much more than it did to the dish. When I would move the spatula the batter literally came out of the dish. And however you make it look when you put it in the oven is exactly how it will look when it comes out. So, needless to say, it is not a pretty presentation. The cake does not puff up and even out at all. It is almost impossible to spread this evenly and get a smooth surface and when it is done baking it really shows. It can be covered up with frosting however. So while the ingredients make this cake appear very quick and easy the prep work takes up much more time than anticipated.",
