I went ahead and stirred the chips in while it was still in the pan. (It might be fun for kids to stir them into their own bowls.) I thought 3 minutes was too long to let the cereal sit before stirring them in. At 2 minutes I put them in--the cereal was already starting to set too much and I didn't want it to get too lumpy for my picture. Next time I will stir in right away. Thanks for the idea. I hadn't had farina in a while and I think I'll try this with some cinnamon chips I have.",
