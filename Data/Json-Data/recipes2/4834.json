I had part of a fresh zucchini in the fridge so I added that to the bell peppers (used red and yellow) and onion (used red onion). Also added some dried basil to the top of the pizza and used reduced fat mozzarella cheese. I did spray some of the olive oil cooking spray onto the tortilla before adding any of the toppings; trust me you won't even miss the pizza sauce on this. What you end up with is a crispy little pizza loaded with fresh veggie flavor. For anybody on the Weight Watchers Points Plus program these changes resulted in a point value of 5 for each tortilla pizza. My husband and I split one of the tortilla pizzas for lunch today and enjoyed it with sliced cantaloupe and a green side salad. This is soooo easy and soooo tasty! Thanks Brent for sharing.",

I love my crust crispy so I place the tortillia in a cast iron pan and bake it at 400 degrees for 11-14 minutes before putting toppings on and returned the pan back to oven till cheese is melted.

I did lightly coat my tortilla with oil and I also put some cheese down first hoping to shield the tortilla from moisture (sogginess). Then came the peppers and onions. I blotted my tomato slices dry on paper towels before placing them on top of the pizza and sprinkling the seasonings. Then I added more cheese to the top. I baked this as instructed but for a longer time maybe 15 minutes until the edges started to brown. Even though I tried to prevent it this was still a little soggy. It wasn t crispy (except the edges) and crunchy like I had hoped. I much prefer what I ordinarily do and that is to coat both sides of the tortilla with EVOO then pop both sides under the broiler on the middle rack to crisp. During the broiling process the tortilla will puff up but just pat it down gently with a spatula. Once toasted on both sides I top my pizza usually using the cheese first and bake at 350 for about 10-15 minutes until all the toppings are warmed through and cheese has melted. And I never use tomato sauce on a tortilla pizza because that will guarantee a soggy pizza.",

I think using that as a base you can do pretty much what ever you want with this recipe as far as toppings go.... I used 8 inch whole wheat tortillas because that is what I had on hand.... and sauteed the veggies in a not stick pan coated with cooking spray... I thought these has great flavor... a real emphasis on the veggies... and you can honestly change them and the cheese to fit your liking... pepper jack cheese was excellent on this... great idea thanks for submitting",

Since this recipe calls for dry oregano and garlic I added it to the onions and peppers so it could saute in the oil and have time to soften and come alive. When layering the tortilla I started with the onion mixture followed by the cheese and then the tomato. I used roma tomatoes sliced less than thick. Romas have a firmer texture and do not get watery when baked. I baked exactly 10 minutes. I expected the tortilla to be somewhat soft but it turned out perfectly crisp and could easily be picked up in single wedges. This is the new summer hit in our house.",
