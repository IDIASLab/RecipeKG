I suggest not putting the entire teaspoon of seasoned salt, but just sprinkle to taste b/c I found that I only needed a fraction of what was called for. This would make a great side dish or I could even see adding some grilled shrimp to this for a great, light summer meal. This is a definite keeper for us~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)",
