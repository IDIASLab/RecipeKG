I added a couple large handfuls of parmesan, a couple dashes of pepper, and an extra splash of olive oil and that made it more of a 4 star recipe. Would be good with chopped chicken. I used frozen peas with some of the water used to boil. Hate that can liquid stuff. Also, I don't recommend using all the pasta because it dilutes the flavor a bit. Add the pasta slowly as you are tossing and taste it. I used about 3/4 of the amount in the recipe.",
