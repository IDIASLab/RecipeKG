If you're having problems with the pie not setting try using slightly less milk and cool whip. Also a tip if you're using a blender blend on a very low speed. Beating with a wire whisk is best but takes a very long time and wears out your arm. Our blender has a wire whisk attachment which works best!!! Hope this helps for all you guys who had a runny pie!!! Also if it lacks the pumpkin pie taste just add a little more pumpkin spice than it calls for. Play with the recipes for your taste:)",
