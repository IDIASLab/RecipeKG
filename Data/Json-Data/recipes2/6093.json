I tasted the kale after sauteing for 7 minutes and it wasn't quite tender, so, I added a little chicken broth and covered so the kale would braise for 4-5 minutes.  I let the broth cook off and the kale was perfectly tender for our taste.   I always sprinkle a little red wine vinegar on top of my kale at the end and it gives it a bright flavor.

Didn't get tender.\" I like my veggies on the al dente side so I was OK w/ this recipe and made it as directed; however, my husband was disappointed that the kale wasn't more tender. I sauteed it for just over 7 min., and yes it definitely had more bite than squish, so if I made this recipe again, I'd aim for a bit longer. I also think I'd have preferred browning the garlic smashed, not minced, removing it to chop and then returning it to the cooked kale before serving b/c the garlic taste didn't shine as much as I would've like, especially since \"garlic\" is in the recipe's title.",

Just sample it after the time stated in the recipe and if its too underdone for your taste cook it a little longer.  For the extensive gardeners, like us, who grow stuff year round, this is most excellent.  I cannot eat raw Kale because it is just too greeny tasting but this is right at heavenly manna level.
