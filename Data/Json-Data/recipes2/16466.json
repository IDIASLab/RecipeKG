This was a very good recipe and I recommend it. Venison by nature can be dry and chewy but with the marinade the meat was tender and I made a little sauce with the pan remnants to keep it juicy. My fiance said he had never had venison so good and it's a great change from the usual venison casserole everyone seems to make.",
