I had visions of the butter solidifying and giving the salad a greasy mouthfeel.  NOT.  This was just delicious--rich and creamy, and what I liked the best is that the mayonnaise doesn't overpower the salad as it can have a tendency to do in mayo-based salads.  Other than adding some chopped celery for crunch, I didn't change a thing and it did not disappoint. I served this as a wrap, using large flour tortillas and shredded Romaine lettuce.  My only complaint is when I tallied up just how much two lobster wraps set us back!  This was definitely a decadent, luxurious and delicious treat! ",

It is wonderful, I would not change 1 single thing about it.  The butter gives it a very rich flavor and the mayo does not make it oily or spoil the taste in any way.  I encourage you to try this recipe, and if you don't have a pound of lobster meat, adjust the recipe for what you do have -- you will thank Dennie!\nThank you Dennie!  :)",

Visit us in New England and you will find that your lobster roll will consist of lobster with a little mayo and perhaps a little celery served on an exquisitely buttered grilled bun. Knowing that I have no idea why I was so reluctant to try this take on lobster salad. I was looking for an elegant but easy appetizer for an Academy Awards party and this salad tucked into wonton cups fit the bill. I made the salad as directed except that I couldn t resist adding some finely chopped celery. For the wonton cups I tucked wonton wrappers into mini muffin cups brushed them with olive oil and sprinkled them with a little Himalayan sea salt. I baked them at 350 degrees until browned and crisp eight to ten minutes. I made the cups and the salad in advance and filled them right before the party garnishing with some finely chopped seeded plum tomato. I have made a lot of lobster salad but I will never make it any other way from here on out. Worth the splurge!",
