It was plenty for a pound of linguine, and was delicious the first night served AND left over... This is my new claim sauce recipe!!",

First of all, we both love spicy food but many people don't so we would cut the red pepper flakes in half.  We also found it abit oily so we would cut the olive oil in half too.  And the last change we would make is that we would have used heavy cream instead of half and half to make for a thicker sauce.  But it truly was a very tasty dish.  Thank you for sharing it!",

The initial flavor of the sauce is amazing until you get the hot flavor of the flakes. Between 0-2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes make this dish a wonderful keeper in our home. I also cut the amount of oil in half and used heavy cream. Other reviewers complained that there weren't enough clams in the recipe. However, if you're concerned about picky eaters, the amount in the recipe is plenty.\n\nNote: if you have already followed the recipe exactly and find that it's too hot, adding some extra heavy cream and a half cup of freshly shredded parmesan cheese definitely cools it off without losing any flavor.",

I would cut the red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon at most! I added parmesan cheese to thicken it up and I agree with the other reviews about using heavy cream instead of half and half. The recipe itself was good and I would try it again with the above listed changes - maybe even adding a few mushrooms.",
