I used a poached, shredded chicken (white and dark meat), some frozen mixed veggies, and a can of cream of mushroom as well as the cream of chicken soup.  Using all this made way too much pie filling, so I made two pies (one to bake and one to freeze), and it came out WONDERFUL! It was the best chicken pot pie I've ever had, and I can't wait to break that second pie out of the freezer!",

Two changes I make though - when I'm making veg for the roast I cook alot more than I need to use in place of the frozen veg (although I still add frozen peas and corn to the pie) and I use ready made, chilled puff pastry instead of the topping mix. Really, really recommend this as it is really easy and a great way to use leftover veg and chicken.",

To save on time I use frozen country style hash browns (small potato cubes) in the pot pie rather than fresh potatoes. The crust is definitely the best part of this pot pie I usually make a double batch because my family enjoys a thicker crust. My kids especially love this recipe and I think it is a great way to use up leftover chicken meat from roasted chicken. You can always customize this pot pie by adding extra vegetables or throwing in some shredded cheese. The only seasoning you really need is a bit of fresh cracked pepper and a dash of salt. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I looked on the bisquick website and saw that some used 2 cans of soup so that's what I used 2 cream of chicken - added 1/2 can milk few shakes each garlic powder and onion powder. To the topping I added a shake of garlic and about 1/2 t dried italian herbs to impart some more flavor. I found that it was ok but DH loved it and said I should make again. I really feel it would have been better with the mixed veggies. Perhaps subbing 1 can for cream of potato would also be good(?)",
