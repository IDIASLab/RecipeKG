One good thing: they don't have to be hot to be good as room temp works fine - so something that doesn't have to be last minute. Also good as a center instead of the nuts: marscapone cheese with a bit of seasoning of your choice. Some fillings I've used: finely grated lemon peel and a bit of honey orange peel (or juice) and a touch of cardamom and vanilla with cinnamon. Try these - it's hard to imagine that your guests won't love them.",
