If I were to make it again I would serve it over pasta or rice. It wasn't bad but I have a better spaghetti sauce recipe that I can add some hot sauce to.",

                "reviewBody": "A nice hearty and healthy \"stew\" to warm you up on a chilly day. This makes a HUGE pot enough to freeze for later. A few things....First this really didn't seem like a stew to me and definitely not something I'd call turkey mushroom stew. Like another reviewer mentioned it really was a cross between spaghetti sauce and chili. Take out the beans and you have spaghetti sauce. Take out the Italian seasoning and you have chili. Turkey and mushrooms weren't the prominent ingredient or flavor. Secondly the 1/2 cup hot pepper sauce wasn't too much at all which was the concern of some reviewers. I suppose if you use a brand that's crazy spicy it might be but I used Frank's Red Hot as another reviewer suggested and it was the perfect amount of heat. Definitely not enough to get the nose running just a nice bite. Third this recipe was seriously lacking in salt. I added about 1.5 tsp of salt to the finished product and it really made the flavors pop. In terms of the other seasonings in this recipe these are the amounts I used: 2 tsp garlic powder 2 tsp Italian seasoning and 1 tsp black pepper. Lastly this came out really acidic. Normally when I make tomato-based sauces such as these I add a bit of sugar to counteract the acidity. I tried that but it was still overly-acidic so I then added about 1 tsp baking soda to the pot and that completely solved the problem. Tomorrow I will serve my leftovers over spaghetti squash.:)",
