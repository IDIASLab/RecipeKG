It is kind of hard to keep the burgers together but as long as you form somewhat of a patty and get it into the pan you will be fine (you can reshape as you go).  Also, be sure not to overcook these guys.  Like all overcooked chicken, they will be dry and not as flavorful.  I just check the middle after a few minutes on each side when the meat looks cooked, it usually doesn't take much longer.  I also added chopped jalapenos to the burger mixture, so good!",
