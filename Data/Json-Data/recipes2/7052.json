The recipe works if you follow it. You cannot replace almond flour with coconut flour one for one and expect it to turn out. You cannot remove the honey from the recipe and then be surprised when the biscuits are salty; there's no sweet to balance the salty. If you didn't make the recipe as written, you can't leave a bad review. tl That's entirely unfair to the author, and it makes it hard for the rest of us to find accurately rated recipes.",

It's easy, uses few ingredients, and leaves me with biscuits that I can freeze and pull out as needed.  I don't press down prior to baking anymore.  I leave them in a small heap and have a fluffier biscuit that way.  Going to try adding shredded cheddar for a cheesy biscuit.",

I will reduce the salt by 1/4 tsp. next time. Otherwise we really enjoyed the recipe. We liked the little bit of sweetness the honey gave the biscuits. Ours rose slightly and could be easily split. If you are new to working with almond flour you don't want to overwork it or the oil will come out of the flour and make the recipe too oily. I recommend beating the eggs and honey together before adding to the flour/baking soda/salt mixture -- then mix it in until just combined. To those who are trying to substitute coconut flour for almond flour -- it's not going to work without making other alterations to the recipe. Coconut flour absorbs a lot more liquid than almond flour. I can't wait to try some of the other suggestions -- adding Italian herbs and not flattening them for a more fluffy biscuit both sound like wonderful options. Thanks for a great and versatile paleo recipe!",
