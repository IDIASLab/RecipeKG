I used the premade Marie Calendar's pie crust and used vegan butter and an oil/water wash instead of the egg wash to make it vegan (Marie Calendar's pie crust is vegan as well). I ended up using 3 apples and 2 large pears and I had about half a cup of filling left over. Once everything is peeled and chopped mixing it all up was super easy. I think next time I'll try a crumble on top instead of the pie crust lattice.",

If you're using what you have and/or know that it will be too liquid sift corn starch (1-3 Tablespoons) or add minute Tapioca to gel. Berry pie recipes call for 3 Tbsp of either. Every pie seems to come out different. This looks like the perfect/traditional apple pie recipe. But in consideration of everyone's health less than a cup of sugar is wise. And avoid crumb toppings on anything as it is nearly pure sugar. You don't need it! Serve the pie warm and put a scoopful of vanilla ice cream (or coconut) instead. The whole country is becoming Diabetic because we don't watch our sugar intake. Plus the lattice looks so great- truly traditional. The all-American looking pie.",
