The lactose caramelizes delectably overnight. You can leave it longer in the oven if you keep the temperature at 175 - the longer it cooks, the more the cream fat will solidify. If you only save the solids, it will be very firm. I normally leave some of the liquid and mash it together slightly. YUM!",

My savory was a Thai dish, and my sweet was fresh scones, with clotted cream and jam. What a pleasant surprise! You have to admit the name is not appetizing, but the result is absolutely delicious!! What a simple recipe. The 12 hour cooking time is perfect, and the cream will appear a bit runny while cooling. After the overnight in the fridge, the cream is spreadable with a buttery crunchy top, exactly as presented in the video. Chef John is right, you will want to leave the crunchy part on the top, as it is the \"prize\" as long as it lasts!!",
