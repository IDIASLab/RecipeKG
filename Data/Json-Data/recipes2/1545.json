I usually follow the recipe closely the first time so I can appreciate the chef s intent and due to how we obtained our ingredients we doubled the walleye and lobster. Next time I ll cut the bread crumbs in half because I like my thermidor a little more loose. Because it s rich we re reserving this for future special occasions.",
