This one we served with dipping crackers and chips plus I served it with some BBQ'ed pork chops and chicken and everyone really liked it. When I plated the pork chops I just made a trail of salsa across the chops and on to the plate and it made a very attractive presentation. I did the same way with the chicken and I also had some salsa in a dish for those who wanted more or some with dippers. Like usual I made two batches. One exactly as written and the second one I changed slightly to accomadate personal tastes. I added less hot pepper half the vinegar and less mint. I can't do hot peppers so I didn't try the hot one but the ones who did said it was great. They would have never thought of mixing hot peppers with strawberries but they said it sure works. As for the toned down version I though it was very good. It reminded me of summer and back yard BBQ's and picnics. Yes I will prepare the Strawberry Salsa again. My family has ordered it.",

So I served it with cinnamon pita chips and crackers. There is a lot going on here flavor wise. I liked it with the cinnamon chips the best. The cilantro and mint seemed to be battling each other for first place in the flavor. I really liked the strawberries and the vinegar. I think if I make it again I will probably cut the cilantro down to 1 T. My kids all really enjoyed it as a snack. Thanks for the recipe.",

The strawberries really soak up the balsamic and take on a more savory taste still a tad sweet but not like a mango or pineapple salsa. I prepared as written with the exception of using fine diced red onion for the green. I drizzled a little EVOO on to keep it together and refrigerated overnight. What a pretty presentation. I enjoyed trying this recipe thanks Miss Betty!",
