The only thing I may do differently next time is add in a bit of chicken stock to make it a little less rich. I also added way more than the 1/2 cup of cream just because I was afraid it wouldn't be enough sauce for us and I'm glad I did. There are a lot of possibilities for the recipe. It would be great w/ chopped tomatoes on top. Thanks for the recipe!",

Be sure to save some of the pasta cooking water to moisten the pasta if it absorbs too much of the sauce.  And don't be afraid to add more cream if necessary. Served this with Caper Baked Chicken and Marilyn's Green Beans Italiano, both recipes also from this site.",
