It's as though you were eating a smoothie in a pancake. I added a bit of baking powder after the first three pancakes didn't rise at all. I also added a bit more flour because the batter was very thin. Perhaps having used homemade coconut milk may have affected the consistency. Thank you for the recipe.",

These are some of the things I ve changed I used almond milk instead of soy milk and only 3/4 of a cup I added half a banana to the batter and blended it thoroughly. Added slightly more buckwheat and did not add the tablespoon of honey (I recommend adding it). Lastly used coconut oil instead of butter. All in all it was yummy!??",
