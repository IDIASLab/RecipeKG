The mixture was very soft so I dropped a cookie scoop of the rice mixture into the flour and gently shaped it and chilled it in the refrigerator to firm. I then rolled it in the egg and bread crumbs and chilled again. These came out beautifully. They were cheesy and delicious. Thanks Jan for sharing!",

Then I decided to add some cooked ground turkey in the middle of my third batch. My fianc\u00e9 said these were the best things I've ever cooked. Wasn't sure if that was a compliment or an insult considering how easy and fattening these are. But I must admit they're great!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!",
