I also use a broiler pan that has slots on the top. So the grease runs down into the bottom pan. Instead of sitting on cookie sheet. It cuts don on the grease and the clean-up...",

If you like a spicier version get the HOT Jimmy Dean sausage and look for the Zesty Sausage Cheese Ball recipe on the back of that package.  They are the BOMB!!!  Beware though.....if you're the type that likes to have a few leftovers at the ned of the party....do not make these....as there wil be no leftovers with this recipe.    Also....do use Jimmy Dean sausage as there is very little waste with their brand...and they turn out perfect everytime!!",

I can remember sitting and mixing with my hands when I was little! These are the best.. I've had them too dry, too greasy, you name it.. but if your a sausage ball lover this is the recipe.. Never had I had them or made them with onion and celery.. I used hot sausage to give plenty of flavor.. I wanted to spread the celery and onion love and used my mini-processor to finely mice them.. instead of the 2 teas. garlic I used 1 teaspoon of garlic salt and 1 teas. of reg salt.. Used low carb bake mix(carbquik)  -- This make these very low-carb.. Yum.. hot or cold grab and go goodness.. For all who are first0time sausage ballers- Yes they are greasy- hey you got 2# of sausage and a # of cheese. what do you think?? drain on paper towels out of oven.. Make sure your baking sheet has sides....   Yes they are stiff to mix.. Put all your ingredients in a bowl and let come to room temp..  These are almost impossible to mix with a spoon.. so... Wash those hands and take off those rings and dig in!! Never tried it but maybe a good processor would do the job...  Gonna make some more today... Like I said with the low carb mix these guys are awesome for snacks!!!",

I would've liked a sausage cheese ball with more HEAT. They were very greesy (but it is sausage after all). If you are looking for something a little different these are for you. I guess I wanted something a little hotter and more bread like. To be fair I did use mild store brand sausage. I bet if I went with a different brand in hot instead of mild it would make these better.",
