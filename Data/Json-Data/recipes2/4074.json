                "reviewBody": "The Ladoo's were great. But here is the few things I'd change. First you have to roast the flour for 15-20 minutes 10 minutes won't do good. To check whether the flour is ready do this after the first five minutes smell the flour and then keep doing that ever 5 minute interval. The smell should be nutty kind of almondish. Finally give this enough time to cool. Ghee cools down really well and you can get a good consistency but it has to cool. Let it sit in the fridge for five to six minutes. once you see you have the right consistency (kind of like butter at room temp). You should be able to shape the batter in your hands. If you want to cool the batter outside fridge give it about half an hour or so to achieve the consistency. I've never made ladoos before and the timing thing was really bad and the reason that I gave the recipe for",
