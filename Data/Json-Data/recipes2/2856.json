                "reviewBody": "These noodles were tasty. I'm always looking for new ways to use shirataki noodles and PB2, and since I had all the ingredients, this was destined to become part of my dinner. :)  I definitely recommend cutting the noodles into smaller pieces, as suggested. I did not do this and found the noodles clumped up and it was difficult to mix in the cucumber.  I also squeezed out some water from the noodles and actually would have preferred the finished dish a little more wet. Next time I'll just quickly drain the noodles, then immediately toss them with the sauce, or thin the sauce a bit with water. This has quite a bite to it, so if you aren't a fan of overly-spicy foods, I recommend only using 1 tsp of Sriracha. I love spicy, so I drizzled more Sriracha over top before serving.  Next time I might also add more than a pinch of sweetener to balance out the flavors more. This would be great topped with chicken or shrimp!",

Not sure if it was the PB2 (let's face it it will never be as good as the real thing) or what but after the first 3 bites I had to dump it. Gave it 2 stars in case the noddle makes that much of a difference with the flavor... but doubt it. Bummer.... really does seem like this should have worked.",
