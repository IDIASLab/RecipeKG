                "reviewBody": "If you're struggling with eating your fruits everyday, I would strongly suggest checking this smoothie out. It has two super foods in it and contains flax seed meal. Blueberries have some of the greatest antioxidant levels you can find in a fruit and flaxseed is a powerhouse for omega-3s and good souce of fiber. Eating 3 bananas a day has been shown to alleviate symptoms of depression/anxiety because of it's ability to increase your dopamine levels. How awesome it that? I add a little more blueberries and flax seed meal to mine because I like a thicker smoothie. I also use the Silk vanilla soy milk but no honey. Most the time I don't freeze the bananas and that doesn't bother me too much. I would recommend trying to use a good plain yogurt, none of that sugary stuff. If you're a big milk drinker try to find stuff low in calories and saturated fat (like Fage) and vice~versa if you're not a big milk drinker. Another recommendation is to add strawberries or a kiwi into the mix. You don't even really taste the kiwi, but that's another great source of omega-3s and antioxidants. I drink this every morning or as a lunch dessert for myself. Yummy!",

I didn't use the flax meal either time because -- well I don't have it and I don't care. (I do smoothies for the fruit.) I also don't have soy milk around. The first time I used (reconstituted) nonfat dry milk and Dannon yogurt but it tasted too much like the yogurt and too little like the vanilla. (And I don't like plain yogurt.) So the second time I went with a different brand lowfat vanilla yogurt and 1% milk. The banana and blueberries both frozen to make it good and cold. And because it calls for vanilla soy milk I also added 1/4 tsp vanilla and a pinch extra honey. And still thought it was a 3.5. I tried. In the end I upped it to the 4 because it's easy - I like my smoothies SMOOTH so I like things that blend up really well. Oh and I agree the banana doesn't need thawed. EDIT: I've made this 2 more times separated in time using full-fat vanilla yogurt and both times would have called this closer to a 5. So I'm drawing the conclusion I just don't like the low fat stuff in this. I've also started using the full-fat version because I see nothing wrong with dairy fat and low/non-fat just has too much other garbage in it and I think is less healthy.",
