This year I purchased 1/2 pig to support a friend's new farm endeavor and therefore had a leg of pork. I did not want it smoked so fresh ham it was. I followed this recipe no changes and it was the most delicious ham I have ever served up at our family Easter dinner. The flavor is complimentary to the meat but not overpowering. I did pick up a meat injector for about 4 and injected the brine evenly through the leg of pork before brining. I would recommend doing this. After brining I did the coldwater soak for about 6 hours and the salt level was just about perfect to my taste. I don't like overpowering salt flavor. I served the maple honey glaze on the side it went well with everything from the ham to the potatoes to shrimp! Try this recipe homemade is amazing!",

Normal curing uses the EQ method.  A seven pound piece of meat should use, in a brine ... just over 1/2 ounce of cure.  The salt should be ... 5 ounces of salt.  This is CRAZY high.  Pink salt or curing salt is toxic to humans but is not present in finished, cured meats in a high enough dose to cause illness or death.",

I was able to brine both butts in same large ss stock pot. I brined for 3 days then rinsed in fresh water for about 15 min. I tied the butts. I smoked the 9lb butt in my Masterbuilt electric smoker at 275F with Hickory chips until it reached 150F about 2.5hrs. I baked the other 8lb butt in the oven as per recipe but without star anise instead used ground cloves and cinnamon. The verdict: Both were super juicy but everyone thought the smoked butt was FANTASTIC. The baked butt ended up tasting salty but still OK. Next time I will rinse in fresh water for longer. As for the sauce I used Hazelnut syrup instead of Maple and it was also Fantastic. Thanks for the recipe.",
