My three kids however loved it - even the one that doesn't like pumpkin! I substituted a teaspoon pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon and added 1/4 cup powdered sugar for a sweeter taste. I agree with the reviewer that said to be sure the cream cheese was completely softened and also with the reviewer who creamed the pumpkin and cream cheese before adding the marshmallow cream. Otherwise you may end up with little lumps of cream cheese that don't look very appealing (ask me how I know). It was probably the least popular dish at the party and no one commented on it at all. In spite of that I'll be making this again. My family and I enjoyed it.",
