Next time I will use green peppers. I think he used canned tomatoes in the video but I used fresh and it was fine. Next time I will also cut down on the cayenne. It was fine for hubby and I who love spice but may be too much for the non-spice lover. That said, with or without the cayenne I think it could use double the spice blend. I have 2 big eaters and myself. This recipe was enough with a small amount of leftovers. Thanks Chef John, can't beat this recipe!",

After reviewing the recipe on Chef John's blog, I found that this site lists green chili peppers and his site lists sweet (bell) peppers.  Next time I'll use a green bell pepper.

Shrimp \u00c9touff\u00e9e is one of my very favorite dishes, and this is the first time I've made it, thanks to your easy instructions. It was VERY filling, so it was okay that we only had a pound and a half shrimp. That easily feeds 6 or more. I actually had good-quality shrimp (which was a surprise) rather than water-logged, which meant I should not have drained and patted them dry. There was hardly any shrimp broth at the bottom to add back in, so I would have liked to know how to make stock with the shells instead of throwing them away (will research for next time). This was YUMMY! And my family loved it! Thank you!!",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent recipe -- rich sauce that works perfectly with the shrimp. I doubled the non-hot spices and loved the result. I also used fresh garlic and onion (I don't have powder). I used canned diced Hatch chiles. But fresh tomatoes. And I didn't have celery. (Will add it next time but it was great without it.) Next time I am going to try chicken -- or a chicken shrimp sausage mix. In other words this is a robust recipe that holds up well to lots of fiddling. And the timings on the steps seemed just about perfect. Easy to follow with a great result!",
