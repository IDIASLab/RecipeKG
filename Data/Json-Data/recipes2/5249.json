I found this recipe while trying to fix a meal with what was in my pantry and so my ingredients were limited. I used powdered ginger (half the amount) because I had no fresh I use fresh garlic (almost twice as much) because I had no powder no pineapple and no green onion. The biggest risk was that I use apricot preserves instead of caned apricots which added a touch of sweetness. I cooked the veggies separate but I'll mix them in next time. Even my skeptical 18 year old nephew loved it....I'll make this again. It was awesome.",
