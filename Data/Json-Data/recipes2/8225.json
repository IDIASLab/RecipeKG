She said, That's ok, let's just use speculoos spread! Brilliant. Speculoos cookies are a traditional cookie common here in Belgium, as well as Holland and Germany. You can find them in America with a bit of searching. Trader Joe's&reg; and Amazon sell both speculoos cookies and spread (which they call cookie butter).",

I made both dark chocolate and milk chocolate and dark is definitely the way to go it gives just a bit more balance which suprised me since I usually dont like dark chocolate at all.
