Ranch and 6oz Salsa to make the 8 oz the recipe calls for or to your own taste. -I used 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of pinto beans.",

First of all I sauteed the ground beef with the onion and a little taco seasoning. I then not only drained but rinsed the beans (less gas producing this way). I added chopped green onions to the mixture and I really love it best with Catalina dressing and not 1000 Island. I play with the cheeses sometimes and use a Mexican blend. Very important to follow the directions and not add chips and dressing until right at time of serving. By the way I just purchase the bags of shredded lettuce. Thank you.",
