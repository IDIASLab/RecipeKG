With that in mind I added a teaspoon of garlic along with the onions and mushrooms. I was really surprised at how flavorful the rice was! You can really taste the infused flavors in there. I also realized that I screwed up while making this. I used the entire pouch of the rice (not reading that the recipe only called for just 1 cup) but you know what? It worked! Even though I only used the 2 cups of water. This sure was quick to throw together as well!",
