I may try again and add some pumpkin spices or use the canned pumpkin that already has the spices. I used the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting recipe I found on this site and it was GREAT with the cake. Again was good worth making but not so sure how the pumpkin comes into play other than it may of helped the cake be all the more moist.",

Wouldn't have believed that they'd be moist, tender and, most important, that the texture would be right.  It was yes to all.  While I was tempted to tinker with the eggs and/or oil I didn't, as I wanted to see this for myself as written.  These didn't taste like pumpkin at all, which was fine by me - I didn't want them to.  In fact, I wanted a bold chocolate flavor, so I added a teaspoon each of chocolate and vanilla extracts as well as a cup of miniature chocolate chips.  I chose this PUMPKIN chocolate cake recipe because it doesn't hurt to infuse your cake with a little good stuff and...because I still have an abundant hoard of canned pumpkin thanks to the Great Pumpkin Shortage of a year or two or three ago.  I baked this as cupcakes/muffins, 350 degrees about 18 minutes.",

I have to admit I used more oil (my old recipe called for 1/3 cup and I believe in a fat cake!). I also added pumpkin pie spice and vanilla to the mix. I only baked the cake for 30 minutes. Finally I don't do cream cheese frosting so I mixed some chocolate frosting with a little more pumpkin and some cinnamon for a perfect topping.",
