I use half the mayo and the parsley is optional. I never like to show up empty handed when invited to a friend's house but am usually short on time when going out so this is what I do. I tripple (or quadruple) the recipe and freeze the rest for a great appetizer in a pinch. I put them in the freezer on metal baking sheet for about 15 mins or until frozen then pop them into a bag. This way they don't stick together. Then just heat as usual. When going somewhere arrange them on a heatproof plate then pop them under the broiler for a few mins at your friends house. Easy. And when you take them out of the oven you will have everyone's attention they look and smell great!",
