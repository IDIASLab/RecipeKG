Since I was out of salsa I added a little Teriyaki Soy Worcestershire and barbecue sauces to spice up the black bean burger mixture.

I threw everything (except the rice) into the food processor which gave me just the right consistency. I sprayed the pan with a non-stick and cooked the patties on med-low heat adding a thin slice of extra sharp cheddar cheese in the last couple of minutes of cooking.

I added a slice of co-jack on top to melt while the burger was still cooking served on a toasted bun with mayo and tomato and they were devoured.
