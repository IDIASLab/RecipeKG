I made a couple of changes. I used plain cream cheese and finely chopped fresh jalapenos instead of the jalapeno-cream cheese. I used a mixture of black beans and roasted corn to replace the chicken. The cream cheese the Borden cheese and the fresh jalapenos really made these stand out. I will definitely be making these again.",

It needs more texture like not using the food processor but instead shredding the chicken & then add other ingredients by just hand mixing them. I would also add just a little bit of sugar to the cream cheese for flavor. Just didn't have much flavor to me. Sorry!",
