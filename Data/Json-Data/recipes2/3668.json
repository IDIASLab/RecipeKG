I have made this recipe with both zesty italian mix and regular italian mix, they are both great!  It took about 45 minutes in my gas oven for the size chicken breasts I used.  I believe the butter could be cut down quite a bit for someone who would like to watch their fat intake, but I'm a butter lover so I'm all in!!",

I only changed a few things: I didn't use canned green beans, I used frozen whole green beans; I used a homemade Italian dressing seasoning that I found on Allrecipes; I didn't use butter, just sprayed the pan with butter-flavored non-stick spray and lightly sprayed the top of everything once I added the seasoning.  The chicken was tender, and the green beans & potatoes were cooked perfectly. It came out so yummy!",
