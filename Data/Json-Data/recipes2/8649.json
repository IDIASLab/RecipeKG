Ran them through my food processor with the slicing blade which worked perfectly for 1/4\" slices. The cooking time needed was way more than 30 minutes so others need to consider this when planning their meal. Ours took about 75 minutes (2 large split breasts bone-in skin on) to get to an internal temp of 165. I had planned on 1 hour so 15 minutes more was not a big deal. I did add some salt and pepper to the parsley/garlic mixture which was a good call.",

That said, put everything in the dish as listed, but I lowered the roasting temp to 275 (250 convection) and put it in at 3 pm so it would be done for the famn damily at six. (I was teaching a class)\nThere wasn't a bite left when I returned home at 8. Not a lick, not a potato, not a sliver of tenderloin. Devoured.\nI'll be making this again both with the pork and with the chicken.",

I also had to add more oil to the potatoes and onions halfway thru baking because they were getting dried out. The garlic -parsley paste is super good.
