Eggs are an excellent candidate for sous vide because you can get consistencies of yolk that are not possible otherwise. However, no matter what the pretty pictures in sous vide recipes show you, egg whites are a problem. They just don't get firmed up properly. This fixes that. The last time I fixed them for my girlfriend, she stopped me mid-sentence to say, 'These eggs are perfect!'",
