It worked like a charm, but my biggest problem was the pinch and fold for the foil. My fingers just couldn't do it with my arthritis so I had to do the old method of accordian folding. It took longer but it worked none the less. Thanks so much Chef John for putting this as a recipe. I would've been lost without it!! I'd heard about baking bacon but I'd never done it. It sure made cooking a pound of bacon much faster, and made for everyone eating together instead of individually, excellent!",
