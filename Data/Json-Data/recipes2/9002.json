There are not enough other flavors here to compete with it. I did end up adding shrimp to some of the bites. I sauteed them quickly in the remaining chorizo fat and cut them in half prior to assembly. I feel that in the directions they need to be much more specific. It tells you to divide and flatten the dough. I feel they need to add to either roll the dough thin or use a preheated pizza stone. I encountered an issue where because of the size of the bites the cheese was brown before the dough had a chance to cook fully. This may be partially a preference thing as I like a very crispy crust when eating thin crust pizza.",
