I did dredge the chops in seasoned flour after flattening to about 1/4\" then dipped in egg and then in panko crumbs. I used a combination of a llittle oil and butter to brownj and the results were delicious. Since I didn't have the gravy mix substituted au jus mix added alittle cornstarch and a drained can of mushrooms. Using the gravy mix would have been better as even adding a little cornstarch to the au jus did not thicken as much as I would have liked. Will definitely make again! Thanks.",
