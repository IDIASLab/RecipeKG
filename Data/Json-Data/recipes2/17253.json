I also eliminated the almonds (didn't have any) and topped the pie w/ pine nuts. Placed the mixture in a pie crust and baked it @ 350 degrees for about 40-45 mins. until it tested done. I allowed it to cool to room temp. and cut a slice. It held together perfectly and was very good very rich but very good. I would make this again. Thanks for posting:)",

I did add a bit more sugar though. Not much. I also loaded it with choc chips. We loved it and my son said all his classmates loved it as. Now i'm going to make it for us at home.",

The ricotta needs to be whipped to give the filling a smooth texture otherwise it tastes grainy. Also the amount of filling this recipe makes doesn't fill a pie crust very well. I would suggest either doubling the filling or piping whipped cream on top. Otherwise you have a pie that looks half filled. I also found that thawing it for 15 minutes was not enough. I had to let it thaw for at least 30.",

The most important thing is to DRAIN THE RICOTTA by placing it in a strainer lined with cheesecloth or some kind of filter for at least one hour. The less moisture the better. I would not recommend freezing this at all. It was a very sweet after dinner treat on Easter and the kids loved it. Next time I would replace the chocolate chips with a block of semi-sweet chocolate and use a grater. I'm giving it five stars-- will make this next year at Easter again.",
