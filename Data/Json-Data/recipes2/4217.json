I did use almonds instead of hazelnuts as that is what I had on hand. I also used more spinach as a personal preference. The only thing I would probably change is to double the sauce as I didn't feel it made enough. This was really good and quick which is an added bonus. Very very tasty and will definitely be making again. Will use hazelnuts next time though just about any type of nuts would be great.",

You need to finely chop the hazelnuts (they are too big if you just use them right out of the bag). 2. Add more spinach. 3. Brown the chicken then bake in order to fully cook (mine were done on the outside but still really pink inside). The sauce is wonderful and it was a definate keeper in our house.

I hardly changed a thing and thought for sure this would be a special dish I could pull out for family and friends and reign as culinary Queen. Alas it was not to be. I used almonds instead of hazelnuts but that was the only change I made. I sledged and dredged my chicken (the chicken itself was quite lovely) and it turned a wonderful golden brown and I could tell it was going to be succulent and juicy. (Not easy things to say about chicken) I used a good wine and fresh mushrooms and waited for the magic to happen. I added the cream but the sauce hadn't reduced at the 5 minute point. I kept simmering and about 30 minutes later it finally had reduced enough to serve as a sauce. I served and waited for everyone to 'ooh' Instead there was a silence. 'Sour' was the comment. Husband was also surprised that it wasn't a fantastic hit agreeing that the combination should have been outstanding. We ended up scraping the sauce off and just eating the chicken. It didn't even pass the Wolseley test as he just ate the bits of prosciutto out of the sauce and left everything else in his bowl. Considering the cost and effort involved it was an absolute failure. So...not sure if I did something wrong or perhaps our family's taste buds are off but this was just not the dish for us!",

The sauce reduced nicely to a thin but creamy consistency which kept it lighter and not too rich. The sauce was perfectly seasoned by the prosciutto - DO NOT add more salt to this until you reduce it and taste it as most of the time you will not need more. The hazelnut crusted chicken was some of the best chicken I have had in a long time and paired perfectly with the wine. Thanks for a great recipe that will see lots of use with my special chardonnays! BTW I served the chicken and sauce with roasted asparagus and kamut linguine - yum.",

I sliced the chicken and served it over a pasta bowl of linguine with the luscious sauce on top. Ahhhh dreamy! Two things I will do differently next time would be to chop the nuts finer and pound the chicken thinner. The nuts being finer would allow them to coat the chicken more evenly and the chicken thinner would assure that it would be cooked through before the nuts get to brown. This is definitly a dish you can entertain with. Any guest would be lucky you did!",

This was very easy to make and very tasty - a great medley of flavors! My first time using prosciutto too. The hazelnuts are a marvelous touch - don't substitute if you can help it! Things I added: 1) Tossed pasta with parsley olive oil and tomatoes (over low heat on the stove) before adding sauce 2) Placed chicken in 300 degree oven to keep warm after cooking on stove. I'll definitely double the amount of sauce next time too. Thanks hils!!",
