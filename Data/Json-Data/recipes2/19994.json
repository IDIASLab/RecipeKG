I work at a restaurant and they serve premarinated chicken breast for their c-salad and I always wanted to duplicate it, lets just say, this recipe is up to par or better.  I followed the recipe as is, except I also added onion salt and blk pepper.  I've actually made chicken like this before, but for some reason, this tasted much better (maybe it's because I cooked it over my new cast iron skillet).  Anyhow, I just used the chicken, didn't follow the salad part, I like my own (romaine, carrots, red onions, feta, croutons, pepperocinis, tomatoes and cumcumber).  I made a lot of the chicken, diced them up and froze them, so whenever I feel like a salad, it's ready to go in no time.  Thanks for this keeper!",

Outstanding actually tho' I must stress that this salad will only be as good as your salad dressing and your Cajun seasoning. Obviously if you're not crazy about either of those your salad will be mediocre at best. Rather than seasoning the chicken once it was in the skillet I just tossed it in a ziploc bag with some olive oil and Cajun seasoning neither of which I bothered to measure. Got my skillet good and hot threw in the chicken and let it get nice and golden brown before turning it over. I used the freshest Romaine real bacon \"Creamy Vinaigrette\" from this site (excellent by the way) and premium Parmigiano-Reggiano. Exceptional combination of seasonings flavors and textures. Hubs was as pleased with this as I was and insisted we make it again with steak or shrimp. Great recipe!",
