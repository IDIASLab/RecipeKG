I left out the chili peppers (had to be careful for the other eater in my house) and the cilantro (didn't have it on hand) but otherwise I followed the recipe. I used a packet of boneless skinless chicken thighs from Costco which came to a pound so I cut the recipe in half. It was wonderful. I've made the original Caramel Chicken before so I knew this would be great. I highly recommend watching all of Chef John's videos if you are making something for the first time! Thanks Chef!",

My changes - I used 4 jalapenos instead of 2. Also I didn't have cilantro or green onions on hand so I used what I had which was a yellow onion. Totally worked! The next time I make it I will double the marinade so that we have more to add to rice for leftovers. Also I see others recommend using cast iron - I didn't but now I see why they suggested it. Yes use cast iron if you have it.",
