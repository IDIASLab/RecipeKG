This dip looked great and it would look like a great Christmas-style dip if spinach was added. Personally I would add a little less feta and more stringy cheese next time but if you're a feta lover go ahead and make this recipe as is. You won't be disappointed! UPDATE: Since I made this one for myself I wasn't able to eat the whole thing. I put the leftovers in the fridge and re-heated them the next day or two. It actually tasted better. Next time I make it I'll assemble the ingredients and let it sit together for a couple of days. Awesome recipe.",

I did substitute half of the mayo with sour cream as I know from experience that much makes dips a little too oily and with the oil-packed peppers it would have been even worse. I also used half feta and half \"italian blend\" cheese and as the feta flavor was pronounced enough I'm not sure I would have been too crazy about two cups of feta. Marinated artichoke hearts seasoned the dip nicely. The red pepper pieces look very festive in the dip and add great flavor - thanks for sharing.",
