Just for future reference we liked the way this recipe worked on the other hand we did not use any chili powder and did not marinate the chicken over night. We simply mixed together the ingredients and spread them over a few pieces of provolone cheese which we put on top of the chicken before popping it into the oven. It came out smelling great and went well with green beans. Thanks!",
