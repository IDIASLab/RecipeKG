I also ground raw organic cocoa nibs in place of the cocoa and ommited the stevia. Since I didn't have muffin pans at my cottage I tripled the batch and chilled the bottom layer in a 13x9 casserole dish before adding the top layer re-chilling and cutting into pb \"fudge\". My kids and I had a blast licking all the bowls and spoons! Update: after layering and chilling this recipe I realized that if you mix all ingredients and chill- this turns into the EASIEST yummiest totally VEGAN peanut butter cup fudge.",

Stevia isn't necessary nor is the extra tbsp pb.) Mix everything together and freeze. Thanks very much for this recipe. I make this constantly! It's my favorite dessert and I often eat a piece for breakfast.",
