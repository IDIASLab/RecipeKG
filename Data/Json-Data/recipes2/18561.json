Something about the zucchini is horrible. I generally like zucchini but sauteing(sp?) it made it squishy and well...horrible flavored. It utterly ruined the sauce which would have been fine without the zucchini. I like raw zucchini and zucchini bread--my mom said this is just what cooked zucchini tastes like nothing to be done for it but I'm not sure. I've had cooked zucchini in other things in restaurants (usually stew) and it did not overwhelm in those dishes. So my thought here is this: make sure you liked the flavor of the sauteed zucchini BEFORE adding the rest of your ingredients. I don't know what to tell you if your zucchini is squishy and gross--but that will save you the ingredients for your cream sauce (which can be made just fine without zucchini if you need to). I wish I'd done that we wound up throwing out more than half of this.",
