I marinated chicken thighs and drumsticks cut into quarters and halves respectively. I was concerned that the chicken might be bland and I marinated for 24 hours. It was wonderful! I fried as stated in the directions. I don't think this would be as moist and good with breast meat. I am rating it a 4 because I felt the marinate was missing some heat and a fresh zing. I will try again by adding some lemon juice some finely chopped jalepeno and maybe a little cilantro to the marinade.",
