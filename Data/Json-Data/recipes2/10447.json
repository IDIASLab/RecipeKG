For the marinade I basically cut all the seasonings down to 1 tsp. each and used smoked paprika vs. regular paprika and used minced garlic vs. garlic powder and added a little more olive oil. For the avocado salad I grilled some thick red onion slices along with a red pepper before combining it with the other ingredients to give it a smoky flavor. Definitely toast your roll first before piling everything on and dig in because you're in for a real treat!",

Toasted the bread in the toaster. came out fantastic!!! My only complaint is the avacado salad kept falling out so I had to keep putting it back on! Next time I'll cut the bread differently so it stays on!:)",
