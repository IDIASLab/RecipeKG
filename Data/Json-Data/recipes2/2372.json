Have used Campbell's Cheddar Cheese soup mixed with one can of Ro-Tel Tomatoes with Green Chilies - nice bit of heat but not too much.  I heat my tortillas in the microwave for 10 seconds, spread them immediately with sour cream to keep them pliable, then top with chicken mixture and cheese(s). I've even added rice and black olives on occasion.  I like corn torts but my hubby likes flour torts better - so I usually use some of each.  I often make these in the morning, refrigerate them, and bake them when I get home from work.  Instant dinner!  Great way to use leftover chicken or turkey too.",

Next time I'm going to use the Southwest Pepperjack soup from Campbell's. Perhaps that will take it up a notch. Topping it with grated cheese didn't do too terribly much flavorwise. I know the chicken enchiladas shouldn't be as zippy as beef but this was awfully tame.

I doubled the recipe and baked them seam side down. After assembling the enchiladas I found I didn't need ALL the extra sauce to cover them before baking. The last 10 min. of baking I topped them with shredded cheese as I LOVE CHEESE. Now I prefer my food spicey and this is not all that spicey but palatable for the average person. Half the people in the family prefer spicey the other half not as much. I just put out various hot sauces on the table for those that needed an extra kick. I will make this recipe again.",
