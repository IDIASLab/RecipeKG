It has the same effect but cooks it in literally a fraction of the time. My total prep time (including cooking) was no more than 30 minutes. My husband and I both LOVED this recipe!! - Instead of using 2 cooks of water I used 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 cup water. - Instead of using refrigerated squash I peeled and cube a small fresh butternut. - Added 1 small onion - Used kale instead of spinach. If you decide to use a pressure cooker you must add your pasta and kale at the end.",

My husband limits his carbs and loves squash, so I leave the pasta out and typically use a lot more squash than it calls for (I buy a whole one and put it all in). The squash cooks to mush and acts as the base of the soup, so it turns out more like a stew than a soup, but we love it. It makes great leftovers and with the exception of cutting up the squash, it's super-easy to make!\n\nBecause of not adding the pasta, I reduce the time on the final step where that and the spinach are added; I stir in the spinach, then leave the pot on just long enough for the spinach to wilt.",

This soup was good even a few days later.  The squash held its shape but was soft as butter.  What'd I do different?  Just added an onion to the mix.  Definitely a repeat in this house.  Thanks!!",

Realized I didn't have tomato sauce so I used a full 28 oz can of peeled Italian tomatoes and added the spices including fresh oregano and garlic and dried basil. I used chicken stock instead of water. I think this would also be good without meat. Sprinkle a little parm on top! Very delicious and satisfying.",
