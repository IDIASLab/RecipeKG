With leftovers, it's a breeze, made from scratch ... it's work.  Either way it's a hit and well worth the time. After a holiday meal half the work is done because you usually have the mashed potatoes, and turkey. When I make it from scratch, I usually use chicken rather than turkey.

I do have some qualms with the recipe though. First 4 cups is NOT 4 servings if you're using instant mashed potatoes, if you only make 4 servings you won't have enough to top the casserole (learned this the hard way).  My next potato problem is the mixing in of the cubed cheese, this makes it awful hard to spread on the casserole and is completely unnecessary:  you'll lose nothing if you simply sprinkle the cubed cheese on after you spoon on the potatoes.  As far as alterations go, I doubled the onion and added a good amount of crushed garlic (to the potatoes) to prevent the blandness other reviews ran into.  A nice sprinkling of paprika might make an attractive and tasty addition too.  All and all, this was fast and delicious!  I'll make it again!",

Soup went on top but I think that next time I would thin the soup with some milk to make it more spreadable. Used about half the amounts of cheese called for; felt a full pound of cheese would just be overpowering. Topped the mashed potatos with french fried onions as there is no way that raw onions are going to cook in the casserole in 30-40 minutes and would be too sharp/overpowering. The fried onions made for a nice crispy topping.",
