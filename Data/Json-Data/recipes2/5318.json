The only kale I had was black kale, so I chopped it and massaged it with EVOO.  I also sprinkled the potatoes with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne as they cooked.  I topped it with cheddar cheese and a fried egg.  This was so good that I can't wait to make it again.  I realize that this isn't even close to the original recipe, but without chef John I wouldn't have been inspired.  If you don't have everything on hand...improvise!",

I say this because folks like me, who are familiar with the traditional Irish potato dish known as Colcannon (which is potatoes that are boiled and mashed with cabbage )  will read your hash recipe and say \"where's the cabbage?!\"  M y very Irish brother-in-law brings either Colcannon or Champ (potatoes boiled & mashed with leeks)  every year for Thanksgiving !  We especially adore the  Colcannon, so the title of this recipe intrigued me to check it out.  It is a great brunch side dish as is., but I'm going to try it with cabbage  next time instead of the kale.  I think it will be equally tasty!",
