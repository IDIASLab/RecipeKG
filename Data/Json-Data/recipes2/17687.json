And I only used one large Zuc.I think two red and yellow would have been overkill. I did't cook the veggies for the full ten minutes b/c I like my veggies a little crisp but thats just preference. On the whole this is one of my favorite recipes. Its easy and healthy what more could you want? I will definitly be cooking this again. Thanx!",
