It just needs some 'oomph.'\" Made this as directed using mild italian sausage instead of bulk pork (glad that I did b/c it added much-needed flavor as otherwise it would only come from the Italian diced tomatoes) and I put it all together in the morning topped w/ the mozzarella and parmesan and baked 350 deg. for 30-40 min. at dinnertime. My daughter loved it my husband doused his in hot sauce and I added salt and dreamed up what I would add to it next time I make it.",
