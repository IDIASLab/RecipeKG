No money until payday but in searching this site for a comparable recipe I came across this. I made this lighter using \"light\" whipped topping and sugar free CHEESECAKE instant pudding. I also used cinnamon graham cracker squares. My youngest child and I had the best time assembling these sneaking little bites of the filling now and then......so we really only got 12 \"sandwiches. This recipe was cake and though it wasn't a true \"ice cream sandwich\" my husband enjoyed it all the same as did the rest of us. Great summer treat recipe.",

I liked biting into the little chunks of frozen pineapple. For 18 sandwiches the filling is more like 3/4\" thick. I would suggest going with the thicker filling rather than making more sandwiches with the recommended amount of filling. One taster suggested rolling the edges in coconut or toasted coconut for a more tropical flavor. They are a little time consuming to fill but if you're not going to eat them all at once it's probably worth it to have a stock of them in your freezer ready to eat.",
