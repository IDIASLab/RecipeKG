I added the fresh tomatoes very close to the end of cooking and just cooked them very lightly so they gave a little texture to the dish. I also used 5 really heaped teaspoons of cilantro seeds and ground them lightly so they were very pungent. Thank you for this recipe I'll definitely make it again.",
