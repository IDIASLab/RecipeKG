The instructions lacked one tip that I did myself. \n\nThe butter was not incorporating, so first I removed it from heat, then used a wisk, in which I wisked it for a few minutes until fully incorporated. The final result was a smooth, rich chocolate glaze reminiscent of fudge. Wonderful on ice cream! Apply to the ice cream at just the right time, while it is slightly cool but not too viscous.\n\nAdditionally, it's not necessary to add the chocolate and milk separately, just melt the butter and then add the cocolate and the milk, stir with a serving spoon, remove from heat, and then wisk once it's all melted.\n\nFantastic!",
