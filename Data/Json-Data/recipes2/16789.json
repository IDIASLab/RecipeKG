I halved the recipe and the burgers were enormous. I didn't have fajita seasoning so I used some Mexican chili powder garlic powder and season salt. I also used fresh minced white onion instead of dry. I didn't measure the spices but I was careful not to over season. Since I halved it I used 1/8 cup A1 in the beef and then just a little more for basting at the end. I didn't have canned mushroom so I sauteed some fresh ones with garlic butter and onion. I did use the green chiles and they were fantastic. They were canned serranos and I seeded them first because they were a bit too hot. I also used a bit of lightly beaten egg to help bind the meat but still it was difficult getting the patties to stay together. I grilled them on higher heat to sort of give them some char and then I switched to a lower heat to ensure they were cooked through. Enjoy these are great! Thanks to the poster!",
