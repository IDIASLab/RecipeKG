This recipe makes a lot. I would encourage everyone to try this recipe if your sick of buying meat all the time. I added breadcrumbs and used healthy cream of muchroom soup. Delicious!",

I did not cook them in the oven or use the soup. I just fried them up until both sides were brown on a non-stick pan using very little or no oil. The patties have just the right amount of protein and carbs. Each patty I made comes to about 125 cal. so I'm very happy about them being healthy too. My patties did not fall apart at all which is a problem I have been having with other patty recipes.",

I was particularly happy to find it because it is both vegetarian and gluten-free (if you omit the wheat germ)which is a hard combination to come by sometimes.  I baked it instead of frying, but would give it a little more baking time next time (probably 15 minutes in the oven, then top with the mushroom soup and bake 20 more minutes).  Also, a tip for vegetarians: Make sure to check the label on the dry soup package.  Some brands have animal fat in the mix.  I will definitely make this again!",
