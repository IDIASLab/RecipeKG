It is the same except it uses 1/2 cup grated sharp ched. cheese in place of the processed and instead of bread crumbs it calls for 1/3 cup crushed Ritz crackers dotted with 2 T butter. I then sprinkle additional cheese on top of that. I always double or triple this topping. Boil broccoli first until done and drain. Then procede in putting together. I usually make it with a blend of broc, cauliflower and carrots.  The topping is great and a nice addition,that is why I gave this 5 *. Thanks Michelle!",

I substituted sharp cheddar for the process cheese and butter crackers for the topping and it is fantastic.

I didn't boil the broccoli first and it was just perfect for me. Awesome recipe!",
