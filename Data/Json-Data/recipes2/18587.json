I used 9 or 10 olives, and more like 1-1/4 cups of mayo. I'm not a big parsley fan so I omitted it. I chopped the onion, relish, and olives together as instructed and added maybe a teaspoon of lemon juice... It's so good, especially after an hour or so. I love tartar sauce, and this is the best I've had yet! Thanks for sharing, Jackie!",

My tartar sauce turned a pretty pastel pink.The onions are important. Don't be stingy with then they add a little crunch. Do refrigerate it for up to a day before using to let the flavors marry.
