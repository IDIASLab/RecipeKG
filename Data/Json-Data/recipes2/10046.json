It took a lot of self control not to sit down with a spoon and just chow down on the cream. It was such a wonderful combination with the grapes too so refreshing. I have a lot of the cream leftover I didn't have enough grapes for that much. I also tried some sprinkled with Oreo crumbs (no grapes) delicious! I think this cream is very versatile I can see it working beautifully with strawberries or pretty much any other fruit. I think it will be great for non-fruit things too. It is that good. Thank you so much for sharing!!",

I omited the flavor since the yogurt already had it. I used a little over 3# of grapes; could have held more if you want to stretch the \"sauce.\" YUM!!!",
