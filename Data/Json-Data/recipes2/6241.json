I think one of the secrets to a good prime rib is to have your meat at room temperature before putting in the oven. We covered it with paper and set at room temp for 18 hrs. The second is to have a good meat thermometer. Most don't realize how quickly the temp goes up once it starts cooking. I think 130\u00b0 is the magic number and then let it rest for up to 20 minutes. The delicate taste of the Rosemary in the au jus was incredible. We added 3-4 bullion cubes as a tablespoon of butter and some water to make additional au jus. Cleanup was easy because they licked the platter clean.",
