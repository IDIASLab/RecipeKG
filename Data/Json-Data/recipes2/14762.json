Add diced Jalape\u00f1o, stir and add 2 tablespoons of flour. Cook for about 3 minutes. (It's okay if it seems all clumpy. Just stir and cook.) Now slowly whisk in the chicken broth. bring it to a simmer for a few minutes. Now whisk in the 2 pounds of cheese, but use grated. Add 3 tablespoons of cream at the end. Now you will have a very silky smooth, creamy soup that does not break or separate. Liquid must have a thickening agent in order to incorporate any kind of fat, (such as cheese) I believe the cook here hopes that pulverizing it all with a blender will make it \"mash\" together enough, and hold just long enough for you to eat it, but it will never have the velvety texture you want for this kind of soup! Top each serving with a little more shredded cheese. Truly very easy and tasty! :)",

All you have to do is heat the soup; add a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with cold water to thicken it BEFORE adding the cheese.  Add the GRATED cheese (not cubed) slowly and stir. It will be as smooth as silk.  If it turns out too thick, just thin it with milk to the right consistency.  If you're not afraid of MSG, add a teaspoon.",

I used Velveeta the 2nd go around and still had separation as you can see in my photo. Not sure what to do about that because I have never found Velveeta to do this? The taste is great if you can get past the separation. One thing I will say is that if you go the Velveeta route, lose the garlic salt and use low sodium broth because that batch ended up really salty. This one has potential for sure but needs tweaked and I haven't perfected the tweaking yet but plan to do so.",
