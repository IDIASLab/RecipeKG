So I looked up aNOTHER chart and it told me I could use vanilla extract!  So I did (one tsp for the one tbsp sherry).  And the gravy just smelled so good.  And thickened up wonderfully.  All in all, a great, easy dish.  Just serve over rice!  :)",

I was on a plane at 37,000 ft. when I came across this recipe and couldn\u2019t wait to get home to make it. I agree with Lisa completely, that this is reminiscent of an old-fashioned TV dinner, those with the aluminum trays, designed before the advent of microwave ovens. When I was a young girl, I remember a rare treat was to accompany Mom to the grocery store and choose a TV dinner. My favorite was Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes and corn (the deluxe version included a really awful brownie). This is what we craved, and this is what I attempted to recreate tonight with this recipe. In other words, I had no illusions that it would taste like anything else, and I was not disappointed. In keeping with that memory, I used cornstarch rather than flour for the gravy, as I remember those TV dinners having a translucent gravy. I cooked the heck out of the onions, until they were nearly caramelized - sweet, soft and so good. I cooked them separately, removed them from the pan, then fried up the hamburger patties. I tried making 8 of them as the recipe directed, but that was just too skimpy for me, so I made 6. I seasoned them following the recipe exactly \u2013 I wanted these simple, the kind of meal I recall growing up \u2013 nothing fancy, just delicious and satisfying. Since I served this with mashed potatoes (and corn of course!) I doubled the gravy (with no salt) and was pleased I did. We cleaned our plates.",
