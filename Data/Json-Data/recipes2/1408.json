Our guests loved it the flavors melded perfectly and despite my inclination to omit the fennel seeds I put them anyway and they added to the taste rather than over powering the dish as I had expected. Note: the recipe doesn't specify if the sausage is smoked or raw cased. I went with the smoked and it was excellent. Also served over pasta rather than with costinis and did garlic bread on the side.",
