I make the kraut in 5 lb. batches and mix it well in a large container as the salt needs to be evenly dispersed before packing in the buckets.  I use a 5 gallon white food safe bucket (which holds up to 25 pounds of cabbage).  I scrub it well, pre-rinse with a bleach/water solution and then rinse well with water.  I weigh the kraut down with a glass pie plate and gallon jar with water in it.  For more tart kraut, you can also add a cup apple cider vinegar.",
