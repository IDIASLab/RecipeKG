Since my banana was not frozen to compensate for the lack of ice I added some vanilla yogurt-omitting the extract-to thicken it up. My biggest problem is the bitterness of the cocoa- I used the type specified- regular unsweetened- and found the whole smoothie overwhelmed with a bitter chocolate flavor (even though I only used a scant tablespoon). The extra sugar in the vanilla yogurt could not compensate nor the extra bit of banana I added. On a positive note:this IS filling...I don't think I'll be hungry for hours. (Sorry to be one of those pesky reviews that hasn't completely followed the recipe I just can't imagine the flavor itself being much improved by perfectly crushed ice.)",

Tweaking to fit individual tastes:) Update: Remade 8/25/16: 8 frozen almond milk cubes 1/2 cup almond milk 2 heaping tbl Hersey's non-sweetened dark chocolate powder 2 Splenda fiber added individual packets 1 medium frozen banana Much much better. Tasted like a smoothie and not an Icee. It is still definitely not what I would call a \"shake\".",
