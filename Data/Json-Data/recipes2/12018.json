My mom sent a box of spice cake mix a can of 15oz pumpkin and a bag of cinnamon chips. Baked at 325 for about 20 minutes (toaster oven bakes hot) perfectly moist and flavorful! I didn't have applesauce or pumpkin pie spice and they still turned out great. Put all of the ingredients in a bowl used a plastic spoon to mix until blended and had no issues with dryness or rising. They didn't bake with a smooth top like a typical muffin but that didn't seem to bother anyone!",
