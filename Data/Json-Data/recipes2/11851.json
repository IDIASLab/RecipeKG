I used half the amount of ground turkey and substituted chopped zucchini onions garlic chopped red pepper and spinach for the other half of ground meat. (This is a great way to stretch your meat budget plus get added vegetables into your family.) I also made my own sloppy joe sauce because I do not buy canned. Instead of garlic salt I used garlic powder (we're watching our salt intake). I also used 2% sharp cheddar cheese. I did not care for this but my three men ate almost all of it. I got such a screaming deal on canned biscuits by couponing my husband was gleeful to have them in this casserole. This was a great way for my boys to get a comfort food favorite of theirs and a great way to make a homemade substitute with healthier ingredients and added vegetables plus it was quick! I'll make this again.",

I was smart & greased the bottom of the 9x13\" baking dish before putting in the biscuits however. I doubled the amount of hamburger used since I knew 1 lb wasn't going to be enough--glad I did!! I kept the rest of the recipe the same though. My husband doesn't usually care for casseroles but he really liked this one! Wish I could've found the Del Monte sloppy joe mix with mesquite in our store as I think that would've tasted better than the Manwich brand. But I will definitely be making this recipe again!",
