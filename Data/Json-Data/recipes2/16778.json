They are not too sweet and I didn't feel as guilty eating 4 in a row warm from the oven as I would chocolate chip cookies because they are so nutrient dense. They aren't your traditional American cookie but if you like cardamom and dates it's a good one to try. All I did differently was to substitute pecans for the walnuts. I think they tasted best eaten warm the same day.",

However It lacks a few traditional cookie elements (salt leavening agent) which makes it taste more like an unfinished flat-tasting cookie than anything. If I try making this cookie again I will likely add some salt and baking soda along with some other additions and subtractions to change the consistancy of the dough and to make these taste more like a truely finished cookie than my current product. I would recommend this recipe to those who like to twick there recipes into their own as this recipe has a lot of possibilies...",
