I found it quite tasty, but as another reviewer wrote, I will probably use a bit of meat rub next time and allow it to marinate a little longer than 3 hours.  I would also try dicing the tofu instead of slicing it as it was kind of messy upon cooking.  Altogether, this was a fabulously tasty dish and I can't wait to prepare it again.  Thanks for sharing!",
