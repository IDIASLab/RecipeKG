I dipped them in a bowl of cold water and pat dry on paper towels before baking. I also thought they needed just a touch of salt even though the Parmesan cheese is salty. I sprayed the cookie sheet with cooking spray and sprinkled some popcorn salt on the oil before setting down the washed wanton wrappers. I baked them at 400 degrees for 8 minutes and served with warm marina sauce. Thanks for this recipe!",
