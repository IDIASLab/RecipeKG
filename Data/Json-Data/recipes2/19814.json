Cook about 10 pieces of bacon in the oven and use about 2 tablespoons of the oil from the bacon to add to the soup.  Crumble the bacon to add as a garnish on top of the soup when you serve.  Also add Mild Cheddar Cheese on top of soup and make sure it's about 2 tablespoons of cheese and bacon that you add on top.  That makes the soup really good and everyone asks for seconds.  Thanks!!\r\nAlso - if you don't have celery which I didn't - add 2 to 3 shakes of celery salt instead.",

I crumbled bacon and shredded some cheddar and put it on the table for those that wanted it. Me and the kids loved it the way it was but my husband loves more spice. I added a teaspoon of thyme and some onion powder to his portion of the soup and set his favorite HOT sauce beside him so he could add what he wanted. EVERYONE was happy because the original is so easy to adapt to the individual. I served this soup w/a recipe I also got on this sight called CHEESE Biscuit I...Satisfying and filling and easy and YUMMY! I give 5 stars to any recipe that can please that many of us at once!",
