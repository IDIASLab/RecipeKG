I use only 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar and find for my taste that it's sweet enough. Love what the addition of instant coffee did to deepen the chocolate flavor. I didn't have chocolate covered hemp seed but I do like cocoa nibs and had them so I used them instead. Wonderful chia seed recipe. There are so many out there but this one is my favorite because the ratio of ingredient to ingredient is best and the addition of the instant coffee really does make a difference. Kinda tastes like chocolate frosting with little tiny crunchies from the chia seeds. Delicious!!",

My favorite 'quick-gotta run'  treat to take to lunch at the last minute is  milk, chia and heresy's chocolate syrup. I make about 8 oz of chocolate milk in a ziplock round container and add about 2 or 3 tablespoons of chia to it. ( 5 minute intervals) Mix it, let it sit, mix it,  let it sit, put lid on and shake vigorously  and put in the fridge or lunch cooler. Its great!",
