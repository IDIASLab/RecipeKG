Just a few notes to make them perfect: Watch the heat of the skillet as the bread toasts really quickly never walk away as you will probably burn them. Turn the heat to approx medium if not a little less. If you keep it low you can cook them a little longer without burning the bread and the cream cheese mix will go all creamy and gooey! Yummmmmmm:) I made these without the pink champagne the other morning as we didn t have any on hand and the bottle shop wasn't open. They were just as good! Enjoy!",

I did marinate in red sparkling grape juice instead of champagne and it was tasty. Let mixture come to room temp before spreading if prepared night before.",

I'm looking forward to the occasion to make exactly as stated but I did make some changes - used the whole wheat bread I had on hand fat free cream cheese omitted white chocolate sweetened cream cheese with a little honey and mascerated strawberries in a little orange juice and sugar - yet still resulted in a decadent satisfying breakfast. Well maybe a little something was missing with the fat free cream cheese...if I'm doing this \"just for me\" next time I might spring for low fat cream cheese instead. Anyway the original version would make a stellar addition to any brunch menu or special occasion breakfast - I'm sure I will be trying it soon and many more times to come! Thank you for sharing!",
