I made the mistake of thawing the pastry dough too early so when I tried to separate the sheets they were stuck together. In desperation with company coming in two hours I pinched off the dough into balls and rolled them out into circles and stuffed them with the filling and pinched the edges and baked as directed. This was much better than as directed in the recipe and makes more samosas. I did make the samosas once per recipe but there was too much pastry once baked.",

I didn't have curry paste, so I added about 4 tbl (or more) of curry powder, 1 tbl of garam masala and about 1 tsp of minced ginger.  I also peeled & cubed 1 potato and cooked it with the onions and added 1/2 tbl of minced garlic, about 2-3 tsp of salt, and 2 tbl of dried cilantro.  I used 2 cans of garbanzo beans and blended them in a food processor until they were coarse.  I couldn't find puff pastry so I took a gamble and used Pillsbury pie crusts and it worked great.  I also used alot more apple juice to keep it moist.  By the time its all done the potatoes were nicely cooked, so no need to precook potatoes.  Very quick and easy and came out just like restaurant samosas (at least to me).  Next time I'll throw in some peas.",
