This recipe is the best sauce I've ever had- I really think it can bring the family together. Just prepare it and you'll see that when dinner time comes everyone's mouths will be watering because of the great smell, the entire family can gather around the table and there will be enough for everyone, I promise! Good for vegetarians too-just substitute 2 1/2 pounds of chopped zucchini for the meatballs.",

However...I do not like this made with tomato sauce, and I also bake my meatballs for a few minutes to brown rather than fry.  I use crushed or ground tomatoes, and I always add chopped onion.  Sometimes I add chopped roasted red peppers or carrots for a little sweetness if my tomatoes are particuarly acidic.  Leftover sauce, makes a great pizza sauce.  We used it on the Brick-oven pizza from this site (another favorite of ours), and it's wonderful--try adding thin slices of the meatballs to the pizza  before popping in the oven--fabulous!  We sometimes double the meatball recipe and make meatball sandwiches.  It's also fantastic in lasagna.  We love this sauce and the meatballs, too.",

Since I'm only cooking for two, I only use 1 lb of ground beef and omit the pork all together. I use 1/3 cup each of bread crumbs/parmesan cheese. This makes plenty for 2. I follow the recipe for the tomato sauce exactly, and it always comes out great. I've made this recipe many times. I've served it over pasta, I've tweaked the recipe slightly to make it a \"sweet and sour\" meatball dish, and I've also made meatball subs out of it (french loaf cut in half with the middle scooped out, toasted under the broiler until just a little \"crunchy\", then slice the meatballs in half and lay on the bread, spoon a little sauce over all, add mozzarella cheese on top, stick back under the broiler until melted and viola!). Really versatile, tasty recipe that I will continue to use. Thank you for sharing!",

I used all ground pork and 1 large link of hot italian sausage.  (Hubby used all of the ground beef the night before in his burgers)!  I also added some grated Romano cheese along with the parmesan and a dash of salt and pepper. I baked my meatballs at 350 for about half and hour rather than pan-frying them.  I was able to drain off quite a bit of oil. I let them simmer in the sauce for a while and they gave off a real \"meaty\" taste which we all enjoyed.  Thanks Joiamia, this was good.",

If you are used to American spaghetti sauce, this is not it. This is the real deal Italian stuff from the homeland. I pretty much followed the recipe to a t, but made a few additions: half of cup heavy cream and a cup of parm to the sauce to try and cut back on the acidity (parm was a mistake, it became too salty, next time I'll try carrots). Followed the meat-a ball :) instructions exactly and added six links of hot Italian sausage. TIP: don't pre-cook the meatballs (or sausage), just gently add to sauce and stir occasionally. They'll cook during the four hour simmering and will come out perfectly. If you are looking for authentic Italian meatballs and gravy, look no more. ",
