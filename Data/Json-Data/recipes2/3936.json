I made this for my family and co-workers and had to make another batch, because there wasn't any left for me! Transfer finished dip to a small slow cooker to keep warm; serve with tortilla chips or add to your favorite Mexican dish! Enjoy!",

We don't care for rotel so I used salsa in it's place which worked great. I don't know what it is with me and melting shredded cheese...I bought a block of monterey jack and shredded it by hand but it still made the finished dip a little grainy (happens every time I try to melt shredded cheese). The flavor was great though. Next time I will still use the white American and just add velveeta to it as it melts the best for me that way. Thanks for sharing.:)",
