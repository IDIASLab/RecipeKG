I found this recipe and was apprehensive because we are donut snobs and the thought of heavy 'biscuit' donuts just didn't appeal to me, however, I thought I would give it a try.  I found that I only had \"Reduced Fat Flaky Layers\" type of biscuits so I was worried, but OH MY LORD...they were absolutely wonderful!  They puffed up beautifully and were light and airy inside and crispy on the outside.  They were amazing!  My sons eyes lit up when he took the first bite and the magic words came from him mouth...'Mom, these are the best donuts I have ever tasted\"...ahhhhh success!!!  I made vanilla and chocolate glazes and they were great and also did a few with cinnamon sugar...YUMMMMM.  I melted a chocolate truffle and added it to the chocolate glaze\u2026that shot the taste into outerspace!  My son can't wait me for me to make these again, but my husband has begged me not to ever make them again...because he ate 3 of them!!  I hit it out of the park on this one!  ",
