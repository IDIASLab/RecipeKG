I also added vanilla to it. But aside from that the cake is perfect as is try it! You will impress everyone I promise!",

I ended up making the yellow cake mix according to the directions (high altitude) on the box and added an entire can of pumpkin to the batter. I baked it in a bundt pan and it came out perfect. I made the frosting without the pumpkin since I had accidentally used it all in the cake mix - still tasted great. I only made two layers of frosting - one in the middle and one on the top. I poured carmel sauce over the frosting and then topped with chopped pecans. It looked and tasted fabulous! My guests were even taking pictures of it!",

This was a very easy cake to make and I will be making it again tomorrow for Thanksgiving. I did not change anything in the recipe. The only thing I might do different tomorrow is chop up the pecans and sprinkle them on each layer of frosting. The caramel wasn't needed either...it was sweet enough but fun to use for presentation.",

The cake turned out delicious! However one of my two cakes stuck very badly to the pan and could not be salvaged. But I was more careful removing the other one and went ahead and made it by itself (so I had only a 2 layer cake instead of 4) and it actually turned out to be a better size for the occasion anyway. Instead of the cream cheese filling I made a pumpkin spice filling using 1 pkg pumpkin spice instant pudding 1 cup milk and 1 1/2 cups whipped cream. It was fabulous!",

My favorite cake otherwise is Carrot and the texture and taste of the whip cream frosting reminded me of it. It was way good! I only changed one thing I used 1/3 cup of apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil. (If I recall)....I love adding a lot of apple sauce to my cakes it always makes it so good.The apple sauce just makes it so much than when using oil. I used Hershey's caramel and drizzled it not only over the top but added more to my own slice. After letting it soak over night in the cake it had the most richest sweetest taste it was really to die for. Wouldn't change anything else it was wonderful!",

This cake is wonderful and not \"icky\" sweet or heavy.  I made the recipe exactly as written and don't think I'll change a thing the next time as it was just perfect.   I learned a great trick for slicing the layers in half that works much better than using a serrated knife:  I use a piece of dental floss and pull it gently through the cake.  It cuts it perfectly and you don't risk getting the angle wrong on the knife and ending up with misshapen wedges.  If it seems a bit difficult to start the floss through the outside of the cake, just start a small slit with a knife and then finish up with the floss -- perfectly sliced layers!",
