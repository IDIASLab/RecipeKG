Once the cheese is melted the veggies are still pretty raw. I don't mind them too much this way and the sandwich was really delicious...just prefer them a little more cooked. I also added a little fresh parsley and salt and pepper. Used a hoagie roll b/c plain white bread just seemed a little plain. Can't wait to try again!",

I also added some pepperjack cheese and that went well with the veggies. Also I had a small baguette to use up so I used that instead of the white bread. All in all a nice quick and tasty sandwich that I would totally make again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

It was a hit with my boyfriend and definitely something I will make again especially considering it took about fifteen minutes from start to finish (and I'm still slow at chopping vegetables).",
