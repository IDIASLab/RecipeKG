Otherwise I followed the directions. I kind of knew that this would not have a great deal of flavor because of the ingredients which are very easy to have on hand. The mushroom soup I used was an organic soup from Sprouts (no MSG). I seasoned the chicken with Papa's Seasoning from this site and it was done in 45 minutes. After I finished baking it and taking my photo I did add some corn salsa from Trader Joe's to increase the flavor. I would think that this would be a great dish to serve to people who need a diet with little seasoning and to little kids. This recipe certainly has its place in Allrecipes' archives!
