Also since Kool - Aid is concentrated you wouldn't use as much (2 envelopes should be fine). I used this marinade for a whole chicken and roasted it for an hour and a half. This would also be excellent for lemon pepper wings. Thanks for the great recipe!",

It came out wonderfully! There was no sweetness to it that I or my family could detect. There was a great flavor of Italian spices lemon and pepper throughout the chicken. I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it...really big hit in our house. The next time I prepare this I plan on tripling the recipe and then freezing some of the raw chicken in the marinade for easy future dinners.",
