In the taste deparment it falls flat and in my opinion really can't stand on it's own. However it is excellent when accompanied with flavorful garnishes. I topped with \"Ranch Style Oyster Crackers\" from this site and added a tablespoon of chopped green onions to each bowl (seconds were requested). This recipe falls in the category of healthy/low-fat recipes so I would not expect it to have a rich buttery flavor that is traditional with oyster stew but at the very least it needs salt & pepper; maybe even some chowder seasoning or something just to give it a little pick me up.",
