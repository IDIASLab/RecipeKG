I think it would be better to cook the crust completely or RIGHT on the verge of being complete and THEN add the mashed potatoes and cheese and just bake until the cheese melts. 4 minutes w/o the toppings wasn't enough for me and if I left it in for longer than 5 minutes w/the toppings ON the cheese would burn. I think this is a great recipe though! I'm going to try it again w/a few changes. Oh my fiance loved it (even though it wasn't done in the middle!).",

I decided to use fresh dough from Publix (already made in a ball). I baked it at 450 for 7 minutes until it was a little brown. Then I changed the temp to 400 and baked for 15 minutes and it came out perfect. I think one of my potatoes was a little too big as there was quite a few on there which seemed to dry it out a little. Next time I might try and cut the potatoes like scalloped potatoes as that is how it was at the restaurant. Husband says it needs more bacon - but he loves bacon! Will definitely make again!!!",
