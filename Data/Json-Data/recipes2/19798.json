The best part is I do not have to slave over a stove all day to make this quickie soup. To make this recipe make sure you have four soup crocks, since each serving is broiled in its own bowl.  One last hint, fried minced garlic is available at a local Asian grocery stores or you can saute your own.",

I replaced the beef broth and the au jus packet called for in this recipe with the leftover au jus from the crockpot recipe. It was a little salty but I think that's because I used regular soy sauce instead of reduced sodium. I'll fix that next time and I expect it will be perfect! My best friend and I loved this and my husband even took to it and he's never really cared for French onion soup. SO YUMMY and you'll have two delicious meals with minimal preparation!
