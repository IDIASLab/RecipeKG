I have never cooked with canned cheese soup before so I was a little worried. I didn't like the smell of the soup as I was mixing this together and was starting to regret using it, but I must say after it came out of the oven it smelled really good, and it tasted incredibly delicious. It was everyone's favorite thing on their plate and I made a LOT of food tonight for our Valentine's Day steak dinner. I liked how easy it was to prepare...not requiring a roux. I will most definitely be making this again!!",
