When they cooled I cut the strips in half lengthwise-perfect dipping fingers. Sent them for lunch with a side of pizza sauce-tomato paste chicken broth Italian spice parmesean cheese and garlic. I will make again thanks for the recipe",

My only (small) complaint is that without the pasta sauce to dip them in these were rather bland on their own.

The kids liked these dipped in pizza sauce I wasn't to fond of it that way but I did use some soft Swiss cheese spread on top and that was awesome. Thanks for the recipe I'll be making these again.",
