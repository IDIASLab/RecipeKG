I was browsing for a side dish for an enchilada casserole and I had an idea to use corn and black beans but did not know quite how to execute that idea. I also thought to make a very simple guacamole and serve with chips or just a lettuce and tomato salad. This recipe kind of combined all three ideas, with the black beans, corn, avocado and tomato. YUMMMY!  I served this on a leaf of butter lettuce with tortilla chips and a steak enchilada casserole and this side dish stole the show!! I will make this again!",

Also substituted rice vinegar for the red wine vinegar (using half of what was called for). Didn't serve with the corn chips - took the suggestion of another reviewer to serve on a bed of lettuce. I used romaine. I coupled this recipe with the allrecipes Kraft version of Enchilada's and added fresh red grapes for the dessert. MMMmmm",
