The end result as it stands is a soggy greasy on the outside sandwich that cannot be picked up at all. The bread is too fragile and soggy from the melted butter. I had to toss these in a hot skillet to crisp and brown the outside of this. The cheese was dry and kind of got rubbery when cooled not gooey like what I'm used to with american/velveeta. Not bad as far as flavor and could use some spices too to perk this up. The broiling idea was great though for browning the cheese and giving it great taste.",
