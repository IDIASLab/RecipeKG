If one is fairly experienced at homemade fudge and candy making, this should not be a problem.  I didn't have heavy cream so substituted 1 cup evaporated milk and it still came out wonderful.  Smooth as silk and oh so creamy!  The key here is patience.  Make sure your butter/sugar mixture is dark brown in color.  Once you add the liquid, that is the color it will be.  Use medium high heat and stir continuously so sugar can dissolve and continue stirring until butter starts to brown.  The butter will separate from the sugar; don't worry...you are almost there.  Lower heat and continue stirring until it is dark caramel in color.  Add liquid slowly. The sugar will set up again but don't worry.  Just stir, stir, stir and it will all reincorporate.  Bring to a rolling boil.  Once I did this, I realized that the consistency was too thin so I just continued cooking at medium heat until it reached a nice consistency.  I know I will have to give what I don't use away, as I don't trust myself.  Wonderful sauce!  Just be patient and don't be afraid to try it with evaporated milk.",

I used brown sugar instead of fine sugar you don't really need fine sugar plus the brown sugar gave a caramel color to it without needing to cook very long. Use low heat with the sugar. Make sure your bananas are ripe but not too ripe. Also the sauce is plenty and you can add two or more bananas if you like. And I did let it boil a little bit longer. And the sauce is thick enough and it can be used as a single dessert by itself! Super delicious!!!!",

This is NOT a good recipe for small or unsupervised children because in order to caramelize sugar you have to heat it to over 230 degrees which is \"third degree burn\" hot. Plus once the butter sugar mixture begins browning you still have to add the cream and let that simmer for quite a while to break up the caramel that solidifys when you add the cream. Taste wise it's very good but its a little grainy.",
