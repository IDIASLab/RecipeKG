Plus, I use cream of chicken soup rather than cream of celery and don't add the hot sauce.  I agree with a previous reviewer and only add the cracker crumbs the last 5-10 minutes of cooking.  I have never had anything but rave reviews for this casserole and I even will eat left overs by themself for lunch the next day.  A must for any BBQ!",

They're creamier and more flavorful because of the additional can of soup. Don't be afraid of the hot sauce - it doesn't make the potatoes spicy, it just punches up the flavor. If you are hesitant, just use less. There are a lot of hash brown casserole recipes out there, but THIS is the one to use!!!",

I used the Bob Evans brand hashbrown and I thought that added extra spice which was good. I also added some paprika for color and spice. I used one can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery. Although these took a while they came out really tasty I made them ahead of time and they heated up well. The only other change I would make is to add more cheese cut in half the amount of crackers for the topping bc I thought there was too much topping and cut the bake time w. the topping back to 20 minutes. Thank heavens I checked mine 20 mins in or I would've had a burnt ritz cracker crust. A nice Sunday side dish.",

But hash browns are, after all, just potatoes and I think a grand foundation for a supper casserole as well.  I used 1 can cream of celery and 1 can cream of mushroom. I had a little cheddar, but I also threw in some Mexican blend cheese and a good dose of Velveeta cubed. I also made this to use up leftover ham, about 2 cups cubed. I tossed in about 1 \u00bd cups of frozen green peas for more color and a supper green veggie. I used 2 Tbsp. Franks hot sauce \u2018cause I love the stuff, mainly because it\u2019s hot but not too firey hot. Because it was supper I skipped the cracker topping and used the ultimate (but pricey) king of all casserole toppings, French fried onion rings. Generously dot with butter and it\u2019s divine. Not low cal but delish.",
