My husband quickly proclaimed these as \"the only way I ever want to eat shrimp from now on.\" Since it was about 10 degrees with a windchill below zero on the day I made these I opted to use my oven. I put them in at 350 for about 10 minutes to sweat the bacon then finished them under the broiler to crisp the bacon and cook the shrimp through. I'll definitely be making these again. Next time I'll be putting more jalapeno in each one for a little more spice. That's so easy to vary with this recipe. Thanks for a keeper!",

I used what I consider to be medium shrimp (26/30) and thought the jalepeno slivers cheese and bacon overwhelmed the shrimp flavor a bit - the shrimp also was overcooked by the time the bacon finished so in the future I'll use larger shrimp. I also substituted pepperjack cheese slivers for the feta as I wanted a meltier cheese that didn't crumble all over my grilltop and will stick with that substitution in the future. Something I'd reach for to wow company with on the grill or in the broiler - thanks for sharing!",

Use regular slice bacon and slightly pre-cook in the microwave so you can still manipulate it around the shrimp. I used monterey jack with pepper cheese and it melted all over the place and did not stay within shrimp and bacon - the feta did the same. So right when I took it off the grill I slid a chunk of cheese onto toothpick so that it sat on top of meat. These are as good cold as they are hot.",
