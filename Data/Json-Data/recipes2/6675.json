Alas I had a couple bags that a friend gave me and I didn't want it to go to waste. All I can say is WOW! This was so satisfying in the most surprising way even the hubby liked it! I made the following changes to suit our taste: substituted 5 stalks green onion for the sweet onion and added A LOT of paprika and cayenne pepper. I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to portion out the mixture which gave me 10 patties. It took a couple minutes on each side to cook too. Definitely will be making these again with different flavor profiles. Thank you for this gem!",

I cooked the quinoa using beef broth to give it a meatier flavor. Yes there's a certain taste to quinoa but you can add anything you like to this recipe and anything to your burger that I think anyone could enjoy them. I did make my patties fatter - made 6 instead of 9 and 2 burgers totally filled me up but the consistency was close to a burger and none of the greaseness of a burger. I hope they are just as good after being in the fridge overnight and re-heated for lunch.",
