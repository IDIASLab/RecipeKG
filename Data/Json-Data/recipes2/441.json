The sauce though would have benefited from less alcohol - I probably used 2/3 of what the recipe stated and it still tasted like a bit too much. That said I will still make this again - it was a fast easy and elegant dessert. Thank you!",

I didn't have any on hand and since several people made remarks it was too much alcohol. I substituted the juice of an orange and orange zest. Used chocolate milk instead of cream. Cooked it a little longer to get a good consistency. I fried the bananas quartered the oranges that I had \"peeled\" with knife and some sliced strawberries. Placed the fruit on a platter and dribbled chocolate over it all. Even without the alcohol it still had that flavor. I'm not sure where that flavor came from. I forgot the vanilla so it wasn't from that. It was a great way to use up the fruit and it was a light dessert after a big dinner.",
