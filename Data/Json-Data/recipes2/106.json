I used a Hershey Special Dark bar because I am cheep and it is half the price of Baker's chocolate. It worked fine. The \"pound\" cake that I bought was only 10 ounces (what's up with that?) so I cut things back a bit. I think that I could easily have made two of the smaller cakes with this recipe. It was very easy and it looked and tasted great. Everyone enjoyed it.",
