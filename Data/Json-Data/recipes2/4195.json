Not sure how I managed to buy the only kind without it but.... If you do this this recipe rocks as it is and will be made again and again in our house. Thanks so much.",

I would prepare the polenta then spread it on the bottom of a 9X13 plan and refridgerate it until it firmed up. Then spread the cooked sausage filling on top and finish with more polenta on top of that and of course lots of cheese! The top browns in the oven and it is sooooooooo yummy. I can't tell you how many compliments I receive on it. For even more cheeziness layer provolone slices between. Scrumptous!",

I have made some modifications however: instead of spaghetti sauce i used a 24 oz can of crushed tomatoes i have added 3 crushed cloves of garlic and about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes. I also made the polenta instead of buying it and didn't do the broiling part which actually sounds really good. (To make the polenta just bring water to a simmer and slowly add corn meal mixing constantly; let cook for about 5 mins)",
