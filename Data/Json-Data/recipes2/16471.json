I don't think that amount of OJ was really necessary and it did make a little more than expected as someone else had mentioned. Overall a very good dessert!:)",

I cut the recipe down to 1/8 because it was just for me and I used only 1/4 cup of orange juice based on what other reviewers said about the amount of orange juice. I wish I would have added cinnamon sugar rather than just cinnamon so that I could caramelize the apples just slightly. If the apples were already to go this would make a very nice dessert for company. Thanks for the recipe TIME2SING!",
