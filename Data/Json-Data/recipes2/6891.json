I cooked the roux well and made it according to the recipe - tasted, added more salt and pepper, tasted added some nutmeg and that helped but over all this is a really heavy sauce for Angel Hair Pasta. (Could use chicken or veggie broth instead of all milk and a sturdier pasta)  I really liked the sauteed mushrooms but did not care for the cooked red pepper, the flavor of the cooked pepper over shadowed the mushrooms - I think we would have liked the pepper raw, more as a garnish.  This has potential but as written isn't a keeper for us.",

In the end it tasted good with the changes. I also sprinkled roasted pumpkin seeds on top and that made a tasty addition!",
