I LOVE japanese restaurants and been to a few in my time and NONE of them serve a dressing that even \"looks\" like this one. What a waste of good olive oil! Hate to be so harsh but this is NOT your typical japanese salad dressing!! I would say if you were going to do this that you could follow the directions for the spice mixture but mix it with mayo instead of olive oil. I am half-tempted to try it that way myself because it tasted fine before the olive oil was added. Just a thought for those of you who like to experiment!",

With these changes it tastes exactly like the ginger dressing served at every Japanese restaurant that I've ever visited. I made the salad with finely chopped carrots, green onions, and julienned cucumber over shredded lettuce, and served it alongside grilled steak. This was exactly what I was looking for.
