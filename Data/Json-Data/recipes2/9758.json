Let cool stir into ice cream mixture. Today I added strawberry puree and shaved chocolate. Swirled the puree added chocolate shaving with my mixer. My 1at attempt was strawberries and chocolate chips. Chips got very hard strawberries turned into frozen bites in the ice cream. Strawberries didn't taste had but definitely preferred the puree. I also add about a half teaspoon of vanilla. Love the basic recipe. Stays creamy. No ice crystals. Even better I know exactly safe in it.",
