The recipe doesn't say what to do with the remaining half of the mini marshmallows so I tried to stick them on top after the final layer of Graham crackers and then broiled the top brown.The fudge was airy and softer than traditional fudge but my family enjoyed this version even more. I used semi sweet chocolate chips and it balanced off the sweetness of the marshmallows.",
