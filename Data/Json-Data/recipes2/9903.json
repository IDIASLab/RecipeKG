This is one of the best cookies I've made in a looooong time,  and I can only explain my making so few of them  because I didn't want a lot of them laying around in case they  were duds.  Oh, quite the contrary.  What a beautiful, perfect cookie  this is!  Not to mention it's an absolute cinch to put together.  I had them ready to pop in the oven before it was even preheated.  The proportions of all ingredients are just perfect - no tweaking necessary unless you 'd like to change up the flavor with a different extract.  Just because rolling out sugar cookies has never floated my boat I simply dropped the dough onto  UNgreased cookie sheets and flattened them just slightly.  Making them a little thicker than the recipe called for made them tender and soft, ideal for a glaze or butter frosting.  Hubs requested a glaze and, happy to oblige, I  used Shiny Cookie Icing, also from this site, for its lack of any flavoring.  The subtle flavor of almond in these cookies was just right.  The submitter suggests these are the perfect cookie for Christmas gift boxes but I submit these are perfect as  a \"go-to\" cookie all year round.  As this recipe's first reviewer I'm thrilled to give these an enthusiastic two thumbs up.  No wonder this recipe has been passed down through the generations!",

Not this year! These were great. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored crisco. I didn't have the entire 3 hours to wait, so they only got 2. We wanted to roll them, and honestly the dough was easier to work with when warm. The cold dough was too brittle to roll. We made a double batch, and had it perfect by the last few trays.  Rolled out a little thicker than 1/4\" and undercooked them just ever so slightly (7minutes). Perfect. I think next time instead of almond, I will use lemon extract or zest. This is my new go-to sugar cookie recipe.",

First off the 3 hour refrigeration time produces a rock solid dough that cannot be worked at all. If you have an extra hour to let it come back to a workable temp you may get a better product. I didn't have that luxury of time. I was forced to microwave 1/4 of the dough and then work it into the rest to bring to a workable temp. Rolled out cut cookies and they CHARRED at 8 minutes. Second tray came out okay at 6 minutes but at this rate I suspect the dough is far too overworked. And because the first tray burned I now don't have enough to send to school for my son's birthday. So thanks for the wasted time the wasted money and resources and the ruined birthday surprise.",
