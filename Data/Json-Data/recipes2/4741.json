Rather than shaved ginger, I lightly coated each side with powdered ginger. I also toasted the sesame seeds before coating the fish. After adding the sesame oil I added kosher salt but no garlic pepper. Once the fish was just about done, I put it under the broiler for about 5 minutes to brown the seed crust on top. Just before serving, I poured a thin line of Trader Joe's Soyaki sauce down the middle of each piece. The fish was flavorful and juicy. Will definitely make it again.",
