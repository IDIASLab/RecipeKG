Most of the ingredients can be substituted or exchanged based on taste. Don't let the few ingredients in the burger itself fool you....it's got lots of flavor for a turkey burger. Feel free to add 8 oz. or more sliced mushrooms to the onions when cooking, if you happen to be a mushroom lover. This is great with sweet potato fries and/or a spinach salad. Serve with additional thousand island dressing for dipping.",

Second, I want to add that Allrecipes did not publish this recipe exactly as I submitted it (these were supposed to be \"Raeben\" burgers named after my daughter whose middle name is Rae).  Anyway, always add salt to a burger to bring out the flavor.  If any dish seems like its \"missing something\" it's likely salt!  The most important omission was on the dressing where I said, \"plus more for dipping\".  As some have noted, they are a little bland without the Thousand Island as a dipping sauce (or spread it on your bread/bun).  Thanks for the reviewer who tried it without bread.  Our family is now gluten-free and it's so much cheaper and healthier to just ditch the GF bun :-(  I'm going to try them next week with swiss cheese as others have noted....at the time I just used what was in the fridge.",

I did not taste a bit of dressing and the bread crumbs made the consistency very strange. If I did this again I would omit the Italian breadcrumbs completely but maybe add some Italian seasonings and a bit of salt to give the meat some flavor. Adding additional dressing onto the top of the sandwich would be much more flavorful as well because I didn't taste any of it in the meat. However even though it was bland the grilled onions sauerkraut and rye bread were flavorful enough to make up for it. Also I think Swiss cheese is a better fit since this is supposed to mimic the Reuben. Overall it was an OK recipe but I think with some work this could turn into a really yummy sandwich!",
