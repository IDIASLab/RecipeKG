I foil wrapped baked the salmon filets with just the sauce while I stir-fried veggies (onion, match stick carrots, red peppers, broccoli, rehydrated shiitake mushrooms, sugar snaps and green beans) and cooked chow mein noodles.  Then, I added the remainder of the sauce to the veggies, stirred in the noodles and served the salmon on top of the veggie chow mein. I made the sauce as is, but substituted about a teaspoon of dried ginger and white wine vinegar for the rice vinegar, as that was what I had.  Yummy!  I would make this again. ...my way.",

The grill was out of gas so I baked two fillets on rack in oven for 15 but check first. Mine was done but hubby's was still pink in middle (oops) I used red wine vinegar and canola oil because that is what I had on hand. Also no mushrooms, but I am sure any veggies would work. Used more sauce while cooking and added 1 clove of garlic. Will make again and easy clean up a plus!",
