They also include more salt and pepper. The other super important thing is that you need to cook the tortilla on medium low heat so the bottom doesn't burn before you flip it. Flip it over with the aid of a plate platter or another frying pan of equal or larger size. Please don't cook the tortilla over medium heat though or it will burn. As my Spanish friend who came over to my house and taught me how to make it said: \"fuego lento\" (low/slow flame) is the key. Along with patience.",

Added a splash of milk to make it a little less dense. Cooked on stove for about 6 minutes pulling back the edges and letting egg run underneath to better cook. Finished under broiler for about 4 more minutes. Let it cool a bit then flipped it onto a plate. It looked much better in the pan actually so I reflipped for serving. Served with a dollop of sour cream that had been seasoned into a sauce with Spanish Smoked Paprika. (Should have let this sit longer to get flavors better absorbed.) I crisped the potatoes that went into it as well which isn't typical of spanish tortilla. I thought the bacon was a bit strong but it may be because I'm used to a simpler omelette with just onion potato egg. Husband tried it cold the next day and said it was still good.",

Next time I may add a little tabasco sauce to the egg mixture to spice it up a bit.  Overall, a nice recipe!",

I think the timing is off, though, because it took 10 minutes just to cook the potatoes.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to start with the bacon, and there was enough rendered fat, without adding any extra oil.  The amount of seasoning was a little off for me, too.  It's always a good idea to season lightly, as you go, and for these veggies, especially true.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion to use a dinner plate to help turn.  Solid recipe, thanks for sharing.",
