Because it does a better job than honey, I use part maltose syrup (purchased at Asian markets) to help bind the ingredients together instead of using all honey. Virgin coconut oil has many healthy properties and enhances the taste of the granola, but if that cannot be found you can substitute it with any other oil. Enjoy!",

It is definitely there not lacking. I added dried blueberries when finished which was a nice flavor match. Thanks for the recipe.",

The coconut flavor is good. The method for baking seems to be the biggest trouble for the recipe. My usual granola is baked at 250 F for 30 minutes stirred then baked another 15-30 minutes according to personal taste. It never burns in this slow oven and cooks evenly through. This recipe was very dark on bottom and not cooked enough on top. My oven may be a factor but I just thought I would put out the suggestion to cook longer and slower.",
