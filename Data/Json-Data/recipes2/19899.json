Drain water and place tofu on a tray or plate lined with two paper towels.  Place two more paper towels on top of the tofu.  Put another plate on top and finish it with something heavy to lightly weight it all down without making it crumble on the sides.  (I use a four cup measuring glass set on top of the final plate for weight)  Let the tofu set for 20-30 minutes on countertop.  This will drain all of the water out and prep the tofu for cooking.  The paper towels will be SOAKED when you take it out.  Discard them and cut the tofu into 1/4\" stips longwise.  Cut those strips in half diagonally to make triangles.  Put these on a plate and freeze them for 1 hour.  They should be frozen on the edges, but not too stiff to move.  Do not thaw before cooking.  This will make the tofu chewy and \"meaty\" rather than the undesirable soft and gooey-centered tofu.  Heat 1-2 tbsp of olive in a non-stick pan on medium-high heat.  Cook the flash-frozen tofu 3-4 minutes on each flat side, being sure to shake the pan often so as not to allow the tofu to stick.  When the tofu is brown and crispy, turn the heat down to low-medium.  Pour bbq sauce to taste directly in the pan and shake around until tofu is completely coated.  Cook 2 minutes until sauce is crispy set to tofu.  Serve on toasted wheat buns topped with light cole slaw.  (Cole slaw pre-slic",

It was pretty good I'll probably make it again. I prepared the tofu by slicing it and browning it in the toaster oven first - the texture is much \"meatier\" and less watery that way.

I then browned it with extra light flavored olive oil and removed the browned tofu from the pan. After I wiped the pan I sauteed one half of a sliced onion in about a tsp. of olive oil. Once the onion was translucent I added ketsup a small amount of Kraft Honey BBQ sauce a little garlic powder and water. I let it simmer a little to reduce a bit before I added a pinch of thyme and returned the browned tofu to the pan. Each piece of tofu was flipped to coat all sides with the sauce and heated through. It was served on toasted burger buns with a dollop of Miracle Whip Light sliced tomato and lots of Romaine lettuce. It was a meal that was enjoyed by all. I will definitely make this again.

A few things to reemphasize: 1. Do follow the previous suggestion of letting the tofu drain VERY well 2. Make sure you don t cut the tofu too thin or you might have a hard time keeping it from crumbling 3. If you use too much oil the tofu might end up tasting a little like the oil 4. If you're in a hurry this probably isn't the meal (unless you already drained the tofu). It also took me a little longer than expected to get the tofu a yummy golden color. I cooked mine with a little too much oil I m afraid. After the tofu was golden I drained the oil and saut\u00e9ed it with lots o onions for about 10 minutes this and the fact that the BBQ sauce I used was delicious (Kraft s Honey BBQ sauce) really helped cover some of the oil taste. It turned out great (the tofu and the onions) and there is no doubt that it will be made again...soon!",
