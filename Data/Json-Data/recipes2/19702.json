I didn't have the whole pepper so I put some chile paste in the mix only a little onion since I don't care for them but like the flavor. It's a wonderful blend of creamy (coconut milk) spicy (chile paste and pepper) and delicious (shrimp)! I'm a little at a loss on how to serve it so will serve in martini glasses or just eat it out of the bowl! Yum!",
