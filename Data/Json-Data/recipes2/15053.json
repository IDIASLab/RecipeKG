It called for a cup of the mix so I measured everything else accordingly. 1 teaspoon of the coaco powder 1/2 tsp ginger 1/4 tsp cinnamon 1/4 tsp clove (added a dash of nutmeg) and 2 tbsp molasses. I then spooned in a bit more of the pancake mix until the batter had the correct texture. They turned out so good!! My boyfriends family always does a Christmas morning pajama breakfast for friends and family. I think I will whip up the batter and take it over there to cook!!",

The abundance of baking powder caused a volcano-like effct of the batter. Six extra egg yolks remaining after making pancakes seemed like a waste.
