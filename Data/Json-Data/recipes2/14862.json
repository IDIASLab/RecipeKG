(Only because I live in Hawaii and Regular Wild Rice was expensive) I did not cook it ahead of time I just added it to the soup (w/o seasoning packet). I used flat leaf parsley (cilantro) because I had it in my garden. The soup was too thick for my taste so I increased the chicken broth to (3)14.5 oz. cans instead of the 1 quart of chicken broth and increased the milk to 3/4 cup. GIVE IT A TRY!!",
