                "reviewBody": "One word...Amazing. So easy and fast to make. I made sure to mix the peanut butter, honey and flax really well before adding the other stuff. It's hard to mix, I had to use a large, metal spoon and really go at it. Bare hands would be easiest, like with meatloaf. I pressed the mixture into the 9x13 with my hands, it was easier. In case anyone is wondering, like I was, you don't need to spray/butter the dish or use wax/parchment. It will come out of the (glass) dish just fine. Most likely due to the oils in the peanut butter. The recipe says to cut into 12 bars. I cut mine into 20, and next time will make even smaller. These are SO filling. My bars are roughly 3\" x 1 3/4\". They are packed with flavor and goodness, so these WILL fill you up and the hunger stays away for a long time. Longer than with store bought bars. Great for an on-the-go breakfast or for your mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. I wrapped individually, put in a tupperware with no lid in the fridge, so they're easy to grab for everyone. You can use any combo of dried fruits and nuts! Oh, I let it sit in the fridge, covered, overnight before cutting (about 12 hours). They tasted best after all the flavors could meld together. Thank you!",

I also love that these do not have to be baked. Easy and quick to prepare and, most of all, yummy!  My family loves them. Tonight I made a batch to take with us for \"fuel\" at a volleyball tournament tomorrow.  Tonight's changes to the original recipe:  Toasted the oats first, used 1/2 honey 1/2 raw maple syrup, used a whole 16 oz jar of natural unsweetened crunchy peanut butter (which is just a bit more than the 1 1/4 cups called for), mixed dried fruit, 1/2 cup Chia seed (for extra protein + it uses up the extra peanut butter I added), and a few sprinkles of cinnamon. Left everything else the same. Thanks so much for the recipe! AllRecipes never lets me down!",

I just made them tonight and they came together easy.  My modifications: added 1 T. cinnamon, pinch of salt (to bring out the sweet flavors), and 1 T. of brown sugar in lieu of 1/2 of the honey.  I omitted the cranberries.  These are very peanut-buttery and the chocolate chips are a nice balance to that sweetness.  I will definitely be saving this recipe!
