This made for less sauce per portion.\n2. I allowed the salmon and sauce to cook for about 15 minutes instead of 5-10 minutes. This allowed the sauce to further reduce, and the salmon did not suffer (dry out) from the extra time.\n3. I cheated and added lemon pepper and dried oregano to my salmon before cooking... just my personal preference...\n4. I served this over a bed of rice. The rice absorbs some of the sauce, thus reducing the amount of sauce even further.\n\n \nI think the given recipe, with the additional 5 minutes of sauce reduction time, would produce a great meal if you like a lot of sauce (which I typically do). \n\nHowever, if you're like the rest of my family who prefer not to have salmon swimming  in sauce (no pun intended), adding rice and/or 2 more salmon portions should be sufficient fixes.",

I used 1/4 sliced onion half the garlic 3 patties of butter a 1/2 cup of wine and a 1/3 cup of cream. Going the full measures would be too much for the salmon and spinach portions. Also no salt/pepper was called out so I added just a pinch of each. The sauce was plenty much lighter than the recipe and still very flavorful. Trying this early after posting I wanted to follow the recipe as is but the butter and liquid measures were too much for us.",
