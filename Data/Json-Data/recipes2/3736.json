I sauteed the apples and onions in the Instant Pot continued the recipe and then pressed the soup button. I think that translates to 30 minutes high pressure. Next time I will try it with 1 cup of uncooked lentils instead of precooked. I was not impressed with my first spoonful. I think I just didn t get the soup right away. By the 5th spoonful I thought it was delicious and I had a second bowl.",
