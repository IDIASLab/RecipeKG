Three stars is being generous for a basic potato salad that calls for too much of both mayonnaise and mustard. How much you use however should depend upon what \"8 red potatoes\" means to you. In my case using tiny red potatoes in an amount that approximated what the submitter must have had in mind I used a cup of mayo a half cup of sour cream and just 1 T. of mustard which I found to be perfect. I also added fresh dill green onion and celery for that proverbial \"crunch.\" I coarsely chopped the eggs and added them right into the potato salad along with some cooked crumbled bacon. Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt and Lawry's Seasoning Salt gave it a little boost. Catchy title and idea but it needs more than that.",

The dressing has a strong mustard taste which I like but others might want to tone it down abit. You could also cut back on the mayo. I think 1 cup would be enough. Other than the cheese curds it is a good basic potato salad. I will keep it for those picnics where people want to have a sack of cheese curds to eat with their beer!",
