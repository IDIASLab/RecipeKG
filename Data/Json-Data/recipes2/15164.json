I did change it a little tho.......I added about 2 tsp. cayenne, used a little more milk than called for, and only about 2/3 of the package of noodles.  I also added some onion powder, garlic, mushrooms, and a little finely diced red onion.  While I was cooking the pasta, I added the butter, peas, onion, and mushrooms to a pot and simmered.  Then I added the cream of mushroom soup, milk, cheese, and seasonings.  I simmered this while I was finishing up the noodles.  Once the noodles were done, I added them, and simmered it all for a few.  Then I put it in a casserole dish, sprinkled the top w/a little more cheddar, and some italian breadcrumbs, and broiled until brown.  It was an awesome tuna casserole for someone who likes things w/a little more spice.",
