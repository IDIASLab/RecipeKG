Despite the modification the recipe turned out amazing and I love it! This will be a new staple to my weekly meal prep.",

Why the cook has that I do not know. Use Sweet Bell Peppers-. Tip #1: Use maybe 1/4 or 1/2 of the Clamato cocktail. I felt a cup was waaaayyy too much-made for a watery mix in the pan that I had to ultimately drain. Tip #2: Boil your hollowed out peppers in water for a bit before filling them. This allows the peppers to be softer after the oven time. What I did differently: I used 2 tilapia fillets & a can of black beans; it allowed for me to stuff 8 peppers. I used Uncle Ben s long grain wild rice-the kind that comes in 90 second packs). I forgot to mix the cheese in but I will next time. I did put it on the top before putting it in the oven. I also used butter Tony s Cachere Original Creole Seasoning salt & pepper. Very flavorful! I look forward to making it again with my own learned tips!",

I didn t have scallops on hand so I stuck with tilapia and red shrimp. The only thing I d change in the future is to add stock or water to the pan with peppers. Even though it was covered it was still a bit too crunchy for me. I wanted my peppers to be steamed more.",
