I had to substitute some jalapenos just because I couldn't find all the serranos we needed. Just a few suggestions for those new to the world of hot peppers...(1) wear kitchen gloves when taking off the stems (2)remove some or all of the seeds to reduce the heat and (3)wait awhile (and don't inhale) before taking the lid off that blender! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I was amazed by how flavorful this sauce is though I would assume that if you can't handle the heat you won't taste the flavor. I have made two batches of the sauce the first without seeds and membrane and while delicious in flavor it didn't pack the punch I was looking for. Round two was better leaving in all seeds and membranes I only removed the stems. I shall be making this again though I could only find a couple people at work that would eat it. Guess that leaves more for me. Oh and I did reduce the vinegar by about 1/3 not too keen on vinegar hot sauces.",
