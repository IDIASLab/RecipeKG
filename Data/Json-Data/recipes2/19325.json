For someone that didn't care for coconut we dipped the bread in the condensed milk and toasted that on a marshmallow fork until it was brown and crusty... A drizzle of chocolate syrup made it like a warm candy bar. That was sooo good.... and obviously a best memory of Girl Scout camp. I did this with my own kids when we went camping too.",

I served them with ice cream and they were a huge hit! But the ice cream definitely wasn t necessary - they re a great finger food!! The next time I made them I heated the sweetened condensed milk in a small glass container in the microwave (so it wasn t as thick and I could therefore make more) before rolling them in the coconut flakes.:-D YUM!! A friend also suggested trying 1 slices since I m broiling them instead of trying to keep them on a skewer. I think I ll try that next time if I m in a hurry.:-) Thanks for a fabulous recipe!",
