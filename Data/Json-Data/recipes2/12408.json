I didn't change anything as the recipe was written other than to add some chopped onion. So we picked out the potatoes and ate the chicken, broccoli and onions, and agreed that I should've just steamed broccoli, and made baked potatoes and chicken, rather than this mixey-uppey method. On the plus side, it was easy to put together, and once I plucked out the potatoes, I pureed the broccoli and chicken to make baby food for LO and she seemed to really dig it!",

It turned out beautifully!  BTW, I used Yukon Gold potatoes.  I like to use them, because I just scrub 'em, and I don't have to peel them.  They're terrific!",

The broccoli was a little mushy but not so bad that I wouldn't make this dish again. I may try fresh broccoli next time. My partner and I added some fresh grated Parmesan to finish things off.",
