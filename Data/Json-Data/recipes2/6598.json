I have discovered since submiting it that the best way to go is to quarter your lemon (DON'T PEEL IT) and just squeeze everything you can out of each quarter. It eliminates the pith issue. My kids love sour stuff so this is a big hit at our house! You can add more honey or even sugar to cut the sourness of it.",

I like it thick because it makes a nice hot day sipper. Plop a few of those fresh raspberries mint leaves and a thin slice of lemon on top and you've got quite the elegant drink. With all the attention lately on how 'poisonous' sugar is when taken in anything other than very small quantities I really appreciate finding this recipe. Keep'm coming folks.",
