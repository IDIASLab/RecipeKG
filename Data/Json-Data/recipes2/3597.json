Maybe something spicy, sweet, or aromatic. I would definitely cook this again, and if I find the added kick I'm looking for, I'll post what I used.\nBased on the other reviews, I used a little less bean sauce, but I wish I hadn't. The peanut butter already tones it down. \n\nTip: I hung on to the juice from the cooked chicken and added that back into the dish along with the meat; I recommend this so that the meat and peas get good coverage from the otherwise rather pasty sauce created by the peanut butter and bean sauce. I think that also dilutes the saltiness a bit.",
