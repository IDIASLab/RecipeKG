Prep was simple I used thin slices of velveeta instead of cheese sauce and that worked very well. The only complaint I have is the bacon on the bottom of the wraps didn't cook so when I took them out of the broiler I cooked them on the stove until the bottoms crisped. Next time I make these I will pan fry them for just a minute first and then broil them.",
