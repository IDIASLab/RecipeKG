                "reviewBody": "This is basically our standard green bean casserole recipe with some minor modifications I've made over the years.  It's ALWAYS the first to disappear at potlucks when there are other versions of green bean casseroles and people often ask why it seems to taste so much better than the original one on the French's can.  I always use French-cut green beans, add a (drained) can of sliced water chestnuts (coarsely chopped) and stir 3 ounces of the French fried onions into the casserole along with ALL of the cheddar cheese.  Heating the ingredients in the microwave is really an unnecessary step.  Bake in a flat casserole dish 30-35 minutes or until hot in the center.  Then sprinkle the other 3 ounces of French fried onions over the top and bake 5 minutes more.  We much prefer the cheese stirred INTO the casserole and NOT put on top.  When doubling the recipe, using one can of water chestnuts works fine since a whole can is almost too much (but we like the crunch!) for a single recipe, depending on personal taste.   If I'm trying to extend the number of servings for a double recipe then I generally use 2 cans of water chestnuts for that.  A tried and true yummy favorite of many \u2013 thanks, Jan!",

I did make a few changes right off the bat based on the reviews of others and it turned out great.\r\n\r\nHere's what I did:\r\n- Use french green beans instead of cut\r\n- Skip microwaving ingredients\r\n- Instead, mix everything together (beans, soup, ALL of cheese, and half of french fried onions) in a casserole dish\r\n- Bake for 30-35 minutes at 350 until hot in the middle\r\n- Add more french fried onions on top of casserole\r\n- Bake for another 5-10 minutes until onions are browned.\r\n\r\nThese changes made it great! I will definitely make this one again. Very easy to throw together if you have all the ingredients so a great little casserole for weeknights.",

I also mixed the cheddar cheese with about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese before adding to the top. I didn't add the remaining onions until right before serving, to keep them crunchy and it was delish!\nREMINDER: Do not add milk to soup before using.
