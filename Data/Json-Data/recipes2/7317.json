So, I cannot speak about the crepe, because the gluten  free flour I had was Bob\u2019s Red Mill Gluten Free, which is bean-based. My husband chimed in how he hates crepes, so I mixed in half Aunt Jemima Pancake Mix instead. I also used chunky peanut butter, and I highly recommend that over the regular kind. \n\nThis made me a fan of Nutella, where I don\u2019t usually eat that. I am the only person in my house who tried the stack as mentioned here, but my youngest child enjoyed hers essentially the same, only without the banana, saying it was delicious. I served it with maple sausage links, with fresh strawberry syrup, plus tiny cut up fresh pineapple I served on the side, too. It would be great with hash browns and like bacon instead.",
