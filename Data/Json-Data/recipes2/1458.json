Chocolate flavor not as rich as I'd like and the blend of chocolate chip cookies with brownies that sounds dreamy did not come through as I anticipated. Maybe if the cookie dough was homemade it might have been better mixed with a quality brownie mix. I have never been a big fan of premade cookie dough so that could be why I thought it was meh. I have two teenage sons - one liked the cookie-brownies and one did not. Thanks for the recipe because the idea of mixing these two scrumptious sweets is fabulous!",
