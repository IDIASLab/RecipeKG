I'd had this years ago for New Years Eve served in a pumpernickel bread bowl and never knew how to make it. I used a can of liver sausage no butter or Worcestershire (thought I had it but apparently didnt) about 2-3 T green onion soft canned bacon bits and the cream cheese with a pinch of salt black pepper and Mrs Dash Zesty - like a Cajun seasoning and about 2 T finely minced yellow onion. We wrapped in plastic wrap - about 3x5 size and chilled. The kids wanted to lick the bowl and spoon clean! Will serve with pumpernickel and Ritz crackers to give the kids different taste experiences.

The bacon flavor is subtle but is something that makes the pate distinctive. I lined the top of a butter dish with plastic wrap and then filled it with the pate mixture. I chilled it then removed the plastic wrap and spread it with with reduced-fat cream cheese then back to the fridge overnight. I did add some salt and pepper and garnished with chopped parsley and sliced olives otherwise followed the recipe. I used my hand mixer on low speed to mix the pate so the ingredients were evenly incorporated. Tasty appetizer with nice presentation and love that it s one that can be made in advance.",
