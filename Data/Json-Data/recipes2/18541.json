Let me tell you - this recipe is a huge favorite with both myself and my husband (who is an omnivore). Keep all the ingredients the same, BUT there is no need to blanch the greens. Simply add a bit of water or broth to your cooking pot after sauteing, throw in the greens, bring the heat down to low, cover and steam for a few minutes before carrying on with the rest of the recipe. That keeps some nutrients in the pot - and also makes clean-up a little easier.\n\nI serve the curry over brown rice, and always serve a side of roasted sweet potatoes and onions that have been tossed in oil and cayenne. The flavor of the sweet potato mashed in with a big bite of curry is absolute heaven... And when I bring the leftovers to work for lunch, I get jealous comments every single time. I can't throw out enough superlatives about this one.",
