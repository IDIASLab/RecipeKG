All you other AR review-readers might think I'm crazy but this is the first time I've ever actually made rice krispie squares; love to eat 'em but never actually made them. I came across this recipe on a hot summer day. Craving something sweet and not wanting to heat up the whole house was my motivation to try this. I actually used the Multi-grain Rice Krispies (to make me feel better about the lack of nutritional value and to add a little extra fiber) and Craisins (because that's what I had). But they turned out spectacular. Good twist on an old favourite!",

Plus how on earth does that fit in an 8x8 pan?! Please tell me if I'm missing something. Are they intended to be super super crunchy? Anyway I made these with six cups of cereal for a 9x13 pan and they tasted really good. How could I not have thought to add cinnamon and raisins to rice krispie treats before? It's like an awesome thick granola bar!",

However the additional ingredients do perk up a regular pan of rice krispie treats. I made my usual treat recipe (5 cups of cereal 5 T butter & one pkg of mini marshmallows). I added the cinnamon in with the marshmallows to make sure it incorporated through. I then added the cereal almonds and dried cherries (dd hates raisins) and pressed into an 9x13 pan. Very good flavor and a nice change of pace. Thank you for sharing.",

I've only ever made rice krispie type treats one other time and now I remember why! I hate mixing the stuff but this was a nice little treat. I did end up using 2 8x8 pans--I couldn't quite get it all into one pan. Thanks for the recipe!",
