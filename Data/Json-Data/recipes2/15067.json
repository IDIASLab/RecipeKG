However I had to change a few things around: Like Maggie said I cut the fuss time in half by using the microwaveable bowl. And instead of droping by rounded spoonfuls I just lined the baking sheet with waxed paper and poured it out into one big piece then broke it all apart later after it had cooled into randomly shaped pieces haha. Overall I love this recipe and so did my family! I will make again.",
