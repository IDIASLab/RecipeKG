I fixed it by melting some more chocolate with cream and glazing the top. Then I sprinkled on some more coconut. It was excellent. Very rich.",

I went to Trader Joes as suggested but couldn't find the chocolate cookies. They did have an almond chip biscotti (0 carbs) which seemed to work just as well. It was pretty easy to make. I did have a little trouble getting it to swirl. Definitely let this one chill overnight. It seemed to taste better the next day.",

Some said that there was no hint of a \"sugar-free\" taste which I totally have to disagree with. I used Splenda for the recipe and it still had a very strong bitter after taste. My husband and I were craving cheesecake (we're both low-carbers) but neither of us could finish our first piece the next day. I put the rest in the freezer to pass along because I hate to waste the whole thing but we won't be eating it. I guess it is worth mentioning the plain filling did taste better without the chocolate. Maybe it's the real sugar in the dark chocolate that makes the artificially sweetened cheesecake taste so bad?",
