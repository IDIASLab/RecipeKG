His footnote doesn't print with the recipe, so be aware.  1/8\" is too thick for the strips to crisp in the time frame given in the recipe; plan accordingly.  1/16\" is better and slices crisp nicely.  A mandoline is REALLY helpful for this.  At 1/8\", I might consider a dehydrator after the eggplant takes on color in the oven, or baking them on a wire rack, or lowering the temp to 225F taking into account the longer baking time they require.   2. While the flavor was good, I thought even 1/8th tsp of cayenne too much; it overwhelmed the other more traditional, \"bacon\" flavors. Still I like spicy and will make this again; both with, and without an adjusted amount of cayenne.",
