I like them with dark or milk chocolate more than white, but adding a white drizzle to the dark/milk coating is very pretty.  I also tried just drizzling dark & white over the balls without dipping, which is very nice.  Yum!  I'm thinking about plopping an almond on the top for the next batch.",

My issue was with that the white chocolate coating (I used Baker's squares) never would set up -- it remains tacky even after freezing and nevermind what it's going to do in the refrigerator. My recommendation to others is to use a standard 12 oz chocolate to 1 TB shortening melt for dipping (half that is sufficient for this recipe so 6 squares and 1.5 tsps shortening melted together). These will probably be loved -- if so I will re-rate this at a 4 but if it remains 3 that means that overall this recipe was pretty neutral for us. Thank you for posting I'm not sure why this didn't work out for me like it did for everyone else I do love trying something new:) EDIT: I promised to come back and change my rating from a 3 to a 4 if these were loved and they were. People were thrilled. I'm not one of those people yet I may wind up being requested to make this recipe again so it deserves the 4th star.",
