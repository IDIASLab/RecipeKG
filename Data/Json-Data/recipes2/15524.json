I wasn't sure how to handle this recipe initially becaue the description of the recipe said to use your own sauce but the directions and the ingredients didn't say anything about using a sauce so here's what I did and it was great. I used a jar of Alfredo Sauce and added garlic and pepper for a little more flavor. I mixed the Alfredo Sauce with the cooked spaghetti and served the \"Lush Pasta Mix\" separately so everyone could top their own spaghetti with as much as they wanted. The whole family loved it and I think it'll turn into a family favorite!!",
