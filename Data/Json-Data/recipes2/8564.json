I didn't have onion so I substituted with onion powder and also added a little garlic powder in addition to the garlic cloves. I sauteed the chicken with red bell pepper since we love this veggie. Be mindful not to add too much broth as the cauliflower does not absorb the water. You will have to simmer longer to boil off the excess. I think it's actually better to use some type of bouillon cube with a half cup of water. That way you get the full flavor of the concentrated bouillon without the extra water.",
