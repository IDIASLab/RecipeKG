        "description": "This oven-broiled lamb chop recipe was shared with me by a chef from a fine restaurant in Vancouver (hence the name). It can be served with a beef filet or baby lamb chops, but I believe that it complements the lamb better than any sauce that I've ever had! Be warned that these chops are very expensive but worth it. Serve with a very nice dry red wine, soft music, and candlelight! I like to serve with rosemary and garlic roasted red potatoes (mashed is good too!) and glazed carrots.",
