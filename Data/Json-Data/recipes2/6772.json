You can really stuff a lot under the skin so don't be afraid of the amounts! I think next time I might rub some seasoned salt under the skin and all over the chicken. 1/4 tsp was a bit much for my taste for just sprinkling on the top. This would make a nice meal for company since it looks impressive but takes very little effort. Thanks for the great recipe!",

Before stuffing the chicken I drizzled a bit of EVOO on the spinach added garlic and Parmesan to it then mixed well to coat the spinach. I lightly sprinkled the stuffed breast with seasoned salt and black pepper. The chicken was moist the skin was crisp and my husband loved it! He thought it belonged in a restaurant. It was so good and EASY! We will be making this again and again.",
