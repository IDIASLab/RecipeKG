I would have liked to have included some of the 'fire roasted' peppers from the olive bar at my local Meijer - not only do they taste good but they make soup an intensely vivid color. I liked the feta but wonder how this would taste with goat's cheese instead. I think I'll be experimenting with this one. Thanks!",

However on its own the soup feels a little flat and like something is missing. Maybe roasting the peppers myself would have helped or maybe some fresh herbs or using goat cheese in place of feta as another reviewers have suggested. Now that I am thinking of it using herbed goat cheese in place of feta just might do the trick... Still this is an easy fast soup that we enjoyed with our meal so I will make it again sometime.",
