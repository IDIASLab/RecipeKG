The only change I made was to saute the veggies in minced garlic and I just mixed all the other seasonings in the egg mixture. I gave it 4 stars because I thought it was kind of watery even if after I drained the excess liquid from the veggies AND patted them dry. Next time I might just try baking the veggies in the casserole instead of sauteing first. Thanks for sharing:)",

I think it is definitely a recipe that can be adjusted easily to be a pleaser...maybe a layer of cream of broccoli soup rather than the egg/flour mixture?
