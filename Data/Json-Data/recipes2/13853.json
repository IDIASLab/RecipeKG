I used a cast-iron pan and I believe that really makes a difference - it browned the crabcakes quickly and made an excellent crust - turning them over was no problem. Don't try turning the cakes over until you have a good crust and don't forget to rinse your canned crabmeat!",

We liked the crunch of the celery.  Here's my changes.  Drain well:\r\n1 can lump crabmeat (Lump crabmeat is the best in the can because it has the biggest pieces) \u2013 put in a strainer \u2013 press down and let sit for \u00bd hour to drain.  Mix: 1 egg, beaten, 2 tablespoons mayonnaise, 3/4 teaspoon Dijon-style prepared mustard, Couple dashes Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp Old Bay Seasoning, 1 T finely minced onoin, small stick celery finely minced, 2 slices white bread, cut into small pieces.  Add crabmeat \u2013 gently mix.\r\nLightly bread the patties with cracker meal.  Fry them in olive oil until brown.  We liked them fried in olive oil for that fried taste.  We fried our first batch in butter and they just didn't taste as good to us - they didn't come out nice and crunchy like we like them.",
