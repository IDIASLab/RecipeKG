I ended up adding quite a bit more until it had the chocolate hazelnut flavor I love. I thought the popsicles were going to be creamy but they were actually pretty icy. Due to the high fat content from the whipping cream and nutella I was hoping to make these as a special treat for us but unfortunately the flavor didn't come through.",
