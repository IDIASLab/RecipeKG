I also seasoned milk/cheese /egg mixture with salt and pepper. We had a Poblano pepper and mini orange pepper from our garden that I chopped fine and added. Thank you for a great recipe that can be jazzed up for different flavor palettes!",

I used 3 types of cheese (Colby jack and white sharp cheddar), light sour cream, and more onion than the recipe called for because we love onion!   I did not add salt because I thought the cheese and crackers had enough salt.  The best compliment came from a self described picky eater who loved it and asked for the recipe! Will definitely make this again! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!",
