It's good as stated but I will play around with it the more I make it. I would also try stirring in some sour cream at the end as I think it would give it an added something. As a side note I didn't see the relevance to cooking the peas seperately...so I simply threw them into the mushroom soup/milk mixture when it was time to add my rice. They cooked up just fine that way. Thanks this is a decent side dish and I will make it again!",

Next I had some red orange and yellow bell peppers on hand so I diced those up sauteed them a bit and stirred them in and I also add a pinch of cayenne pepper to brighten up the flavors. It made lots. I can also see that this would make a great chicken or turkey casserole. If I make this again and have some slivered almonds on hand I'd probably add those too. Very verstile recipe.
