This chicken salad works well as an appetizer dip/spread with sturdy crackers or as an entre because it is a great sandwich filling. I am a fan of seasoned mayo as my 'adhesive' of choice instead of Miracle Whip Pesto dill or roasted red pepper add a nice flavor to mayonaisse and both work well in this salad. I skipped the croutons and didn't miss them.",

I had some shredded chicken I found in my deep freeze and this fit the bill using the little bits of what I had on hand. I did not have a full two cups of almonds I actually had just under a cup of slivered almonds that I found in the back of my pantry. I used caesar seasoned croutons (a bargain find for cheap at my Grocery Outlet for almost nothing) and I ran them through my blender a cup at a time to break down the croutons just a bit. I used 2% shredded sharp cheddar and because we are absolutely not Miracle Whip eaters I used Best Foods mayonnaise. I have to say that with a little personalization with a bit of pepper/chopped green onion/garlic powder/onion powder/dill weed/few shakes Frank's Hot Sauce this is THE BEST chicken salad I've ever had. EVER. My husband wasn't sure about it in the beginning but he loved it as much as I did. Even the littlest who is picky about everything inhaled a sandwich and a half of this. Thank you so much Nicole for a new family favorite. I bet this would be just as good with leftover Thanksgiving turkey and I'll tell you it cost next to nothing for me to make. Yum yum! So happy with this recipe.",

I prefer a true chicken salad without all the bread and eggs as fillers. The croutons made the salad salty and very dry. (The salad wasn't better the next day it was just dryer). Hubby asked me never to make this again! A true chicken salad with the addition of seedless grape halves and almonds is so much better.",
