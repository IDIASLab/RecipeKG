I guess I cut these a little too thin bc bf complained they were a bit too done. But that would be our fault not the fault of the recipe. I marinated this overnight then flipped so the other side could be in the marinade. Bf grilled these when he got home tonight. I made a couple of changes: I used minced garlic (didn't feel like making garlic paste) and I don't have ginger paste so I used dried ginger. I also added some garam masala to the marinade itself mostly bc I thought I might forget to sprinkle it on the chops. I didn't grill them; bf did while I walked the dog so they didn't get sprinkled with the garam masala. So I'm glad I added that to the marinade. Very nice flavor and it's enough marinade if you flip the chops but not too much so you have to throw out a lot of liquid. Thanks for the recipe!",
