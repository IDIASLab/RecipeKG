The flavour of the egg and quinoa go well together as does the texture of the two.  Quinoa has that nutty crunch to it that makes this a dazzler in your mouth; like eating a sparkler on the 4th of July.  Seeing that the submitter wrote to add any vegetable and cheese I wanted, I did.  I used tri-color quinoa.  I then added 3/4 cup mix of grated zucchini, red bell pepper, shallot and carrot.  I had to sub a soft cheese (robiola)  because it's all I had.  Mine came out a bit bland and can see where a more robust cheese like feta would be the right type.  I also used 5 cocottes each having a 1 cup capacity and filled them only half way as instructed.  These yielded 2.5 cups of \"batter\".  Seeing that I used more veggies than required I can see where 6 normal muffin moulds would hold the original recipe batter.  As you can see in my picture, they didn't fill up completely upon cooking.  Cooking time took about 22 minutes and the veggies were cooked completely as was the egg.  They served nicely with a beet and spinach salad.  You gotta try these!  Thanks for sharing.  UPDATE:  Left them in the fridge overnight.  Next day I made a sandwich out of one (on a ciabatta roll), tossed it in the briefcase and it's delicious at room temp as a panino.",

We have a powerful oven so between two trays one set for 23 minutes and the other at 20 minutes; the latter prevented the egg from drying out. While I was at it I added chia seeds because why not!

The second time I added 2 italian chicken sausages. Both times I used fresh thyme and tripled the veggies. I used shredded carrots spinach mushrooms zucchini bell pepper and onion. I substituted egg whites from a carton for 5 of the eggs and used 2 whole eggs. I stirred in red pepper flakes and didn't use any salt due to the sausage. I also substituted 1/4 cup shredded fresh romano and parmesan blend for the feta. This is a great recipe to customize with different veggies and cheese combinations based on your preference. This one is a keeper! Thanks for putting it in the magazine or else I probably would not have seen/tried it.",
