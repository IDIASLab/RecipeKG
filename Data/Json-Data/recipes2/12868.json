I also used peppermint extract and put 1/4 tsp in dark chocolate and 3/4 tsp in white chocolate. I've never made this before and was a little nervous that it would separate when broken but I read to just put it in the freezer while you heat up white chocolate then carefully smooth over the dark chocolate and it turned out fantastic. I also put mostly candy cane dust in between the layers and pressed in some of the larger pieces. I will definitely be making this every year!",

I made the recipe twice as the first time I had a problem with the chocolate and white layers separating when I cut it.  On the second batch, I did not add the layer of mints in between the two chocolates. I spread the melted white chocolate over the already spread (but still warm) milk chocolate layer, swirled the two together with a knife and sprinkled with the crushed mints. The second batch came out perfect!! Thanks again for sharing. This one is a keeper!",

It took about ten minutes, but it turned out perfectly.  I didn't have my double boiler since we are away from home.  Also, after we poured the white chocolate on top of the dark, we let it sit out for about 10 minutes hoping to give the warm white some time to melt the top layer of the dark to promote bonding.  It worked great!  I was nervous because of the other reviews of it not bonding together so we decided to let it sit out for that purpose.",

Very easy to do in double boiler, no need to worry about scorching, so you don't need to watch it so carefully. Definitely opt for the peppermint oil, it adds a punch of flavour.  I used candy canes and put them in the freezer so they crush up beautifully in a plastic bag using a hammer. Be sure to have a pan big enough so you can spread this out thinly. It's too had to break up (and eat) if it's too thick. Thank you, this goes into my Christmas repertoire. Great for gifts!",
