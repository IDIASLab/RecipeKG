The chicken fell apart to the point we renamed the dish \"Pulled Mexican Chicken\" Plus the meat was dry and the veggies were soggy even though I put them when it only had 45 minutes left and it was way to soupy.. to the point it turned the tortillas soggy when we assembled them Tried draining but no luck. I never had dry meat but I had to drain juice off.. I did like the idea of the salsa instead of water. Next time I think I will make fajitas the old fashioned way and use the slow cooker to keep them warm. The searing helps keeps the breast meat moist.",

I would probably also increase the amount of peppers/onions and garnish with chopped cilantro. I used the liner which was absolutely wonderful! Thanks Reynolds!",
