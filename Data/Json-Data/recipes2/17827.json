Even my husband was impressed. Everyone in my family went back for seconds of this salad. I've never used catalina but the sweetness of it brings everything together and then constrasts with the chips. So delicous! I can't wait to make this again!",

Omitted green pepper because I don't like it.  Omitted cheese because I didn't think it would add to the taste and thought I would save the fat/calories in this case.  If I had used it I was thinking I might cube it rather than use shredded cheese. I also substituted the catalina dressing with a basic vinaigrette.  I didn't have catalina dressing and the vinaigrette sounded so fresh tasting.  Loved the fritos. I thought about adding tortilla chips but the fritos made the salad in my opinion.  Even though I varied the recipe, I think it is an all-star recipe.  I do hope to try catalina dressing at some point.  I almost forgot - when I read the recipe I thought it had a can of black beans in it.  Even though it didn't, I added them anyway and would definitely do so again!  Thanks for sharing!",

I seeded the cucumber and tomatoes. The \"Western\" brand dressing available in the midwest is very good for this and I used the light version. It is very similar to Catalina. Also I used a little less green onion. I will try as someone else suggested and add drained black beans next time. This is so great for summer. Will enjoy this a lot Thanks to Mrs Potts from Susie",

I personally gave it 4 stars because it was good but not awesome ( I'm picky: ) I was expecting some great flavor combination & really it tastes like it sounds - veggies & cheese in catalina dressing with corn chips on top. Might try the black beans suggested - I think that might work better than the olives. Also for fun this could be a really different salsa served with large corn chips for scooping instead of the fritos!",
