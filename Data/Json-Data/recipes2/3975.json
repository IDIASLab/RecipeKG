Topped with 1/4c. shredded cheddar cheese. It's really not too ugly but it sure is great! Will definately make again and again!!! Served with Fritos Scoops and all I brought home was the emply bowl.

Matter of fact it's not the worst but I wasn't really pleased at all with this recipe after I threw the simple ingredients and followed the steps. All I could taste was soupy mayo with chunks. No kick of spice from the can diced tomatoes w/green chile peppers(Rotel) I couldn't even taste not one bit of cream cheese flavor. I'm sorry to say that as written. It was not impressive or flavorful it was bland as bland could get. However if I had to make again...I'd cut the mayo in half and not drain the diced tomatoes. But I even took a suggestion from another friend to try and spice it up by adding chili powder and some taco seasonings to it. I sorry for giving this highly rate recipe a very poor rating. It just didn't have umph or flavor.",
