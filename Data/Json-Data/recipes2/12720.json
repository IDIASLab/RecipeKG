This was so easy to put together and was perfect accompnaiment to a Thanksgiving meal. And I must say I'll definitely be making this for other special occasions. It's a great combination of flavors and everyone enjoyed it. I did opt to used canned pears along with a little bit of the juice vs. a fresh pear. I also used a very nice Chardonnay for the white wine and after it was done blending I did add just a touch of honey for sweetness. This definitely gets better over time and thickens up so be sure to make it the night before. This was fabulous over a mix of butter lettuce dried cranberries chopped apples and pears toasted walnuts and topped with goat cheese crumbles. Great recipe!",

Rather than use fresh pears in the dressing I did use 3 home-canned pear halves. The rest of the dressing was made exactly as written and will be made many times more. Incredibly delicious. Thanks for a great recipe.",

When I first tasted it I thought the white wine (I used a nice chardonnay) was overpowering but it seemed to mellow out as it sat so I would suggest making this in advance. I don t think my pear was very sweet so I did end up putting about 1 teaspoon of brown sugar in it which made it just right. I served this on a salad of mixed greens chopped pear toasted pine nuts and feta cheese. Very good! I d like to try it with apple next time.",
