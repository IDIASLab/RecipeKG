I tasted the mixture and decided to add a little unsweetened cocoa a pinch of salt and a bit more almond butter. I found they tasted better after being in the fridge over night. If looking for a subtitute for a Lara bar or other commercial bar that sweetens using dried dates this may be a money saving option. I wouldn't suggest this if a lover of sweets that typically uses refined sugar. This is more for someone that avoid sugars.",

I will add cocoa the next time per other suggestions but these taste great and are easy to make into balls. Surprisingly after putting them in the freezer on a tray I realized the balls were not sticking to the other balls when touching so I transferred into a baggie to transport to a party. I suggest doubling or tripling the recipe if you are making for a party. This is great to make with kids.",
