I also added a small drop of pancake syrup on the top of the uncooked batter in the muffin cups prior to baking because I like just a little more syrup. Because of that I had to cook for about 20 minutes total. Everything else was exactly as the recipe stated. They turned out wonderfully! This is a new breakfast favorite for me!",
