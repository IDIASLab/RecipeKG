I had whole fried tilapia in an Asian restaurant once and was sure that there was something trickier than just frying it; but no there isn't! I used canola to health up the frying and fried until super crispy 10-12 min. I was in a hurry so I didn't make paste but used Asian Rooster sauce and premade garlic-chili oil. The fish is sooo much more tender this way! THANK YOU!",
