I served this last night with some (spicy) blackened fish and the pairing was incredible! I'll probably make something similar to this again but maybe try out some sort of more mild flavored dressing--maybe just a splash each of oil vinegar and lime. The vegetables in this dish stay crunchy and flavorful for at least a couple days and even get more delicious as the different flavors sit together longer. Thanks for the great recipe idea!",

I substituted red wine vinegar for raspberry and used a dash of dried mint instead of fresh:(. Also I happened to have agave syrup so I used abt. a tsp. of it instead of nectar. I couldn't wait 30 minutes and dove right in. Unfortunately this recipe fell flat for me. I love all the ingredients but this combination needs a little somethin' somethin'. I added a dash of cayenne and a few chopped green onions. It was a little better. Admittingly I tried it an hour later after the dressing had time to work its magic and it did get better. Ultimately though it still seems like it needs something to add pizzazz. I don't use mangos or jicima a lot and don't have any good ideas for this one.",

I left out the carrots just because I don't like them but we didn't reduce the amount of the other spices (zest raspberry vinegar etc.) that went in. Also we cut the ingredients cubed vs. julienne - just a different texture. It did taste better the 2nd day - very refreshing because of the mint and crunchy jicama sweet because of the mango and tangy because of the vinegar.",
