Heating mushroom soup and cream cheese together first and wisking is a better way to blend. I didn't watch soup carefully enough and it boiled causing the soup to brown on the bottom.  This worked to my advantage because the brown flecks disguised the mushrooms which my husband ordinarily won't eat - ha, ha!  He asked me to cut the pepper in half next time.",

I used frozen corn, added the juice from the clams, further thinned the chowder with additional milk, used more garlic (4 small cloves), traded the parsley with Old Bay, and added a couple extra dashes of cayenne (I like spicy!). Furthermore, I made this recipe on the spur of the moment - so, I only had on hand uncooked frozen shrimp, canned clams and canned crab meat. I was very concerned that the canned seafood would diminish the flavor of the chowder - no need to worry - it was delicious! And even my foodie friends were impressed....they said it beat any restaurant seafood chowder they had eaten! Thanks for the great recipe!",
