It doesn't taste like maple. All the ingredients blend well with the sausage spices to create a delicious flavor. The onions are wonderful. I'd add even more than a cup. The sausage is very tender and melts in your mouth. The left overs are just as tender. I gave this a 4 because not all my guests liked it. Some were expecting the traditional bratwurst and were disappointed. The majority loved it including my family.",
