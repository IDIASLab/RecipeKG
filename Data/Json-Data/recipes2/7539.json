                "reviewBody": "7.18.16 I rarely change a recipe first time through particularly if I m the first reviewer but I did make a couple changes in this one. I never eat 4 slices of bacon for breakfast (that's a lot of bacon to fit into a coffee mug)) and even two tortillas seemed excessive to me so I used 1 tortilla and 3 slices of bacon (1 more than usual). When I took the mug out of the micro the tortilla was sitting in about 1/2 of bacon grease (totally didn t like that) so I set it aside on a paper towel to drain. I know microwaves cook differently and cooking this at 4 minutes in mine made it hard as a rock inedible had to throw it out. Don t want to discourage others from trying this recipe but I d recommend you set your timer at 1-1/2 to 2 minutes for a first check adjust your time accordingly and it just may work for you. I like the concept of this but unfortunately it was a failure for me today. Doubtful that I ll try again just move on. I'm giving this 2 stars only because I think the key to success here is getting the timing right for your microwave...good luck!",
