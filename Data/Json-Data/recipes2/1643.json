That, with the sausage, makes for an amazing flavor combination. I do add the peas for color and because they go so well with the dish. I usually do just 1 cup of heavy cream, and then 1 cup of half & half or milk, to cut calories (though I've read that half & half can become lumpy if overheated, I've never had that issue...yet).  Do try this easy dinner tonight!**Update 12/14** I just realized that the recipe above does not list peas as an optional ingredient. On the Hilshire Farms website, where I originally discovered this recipe, it mentions adding a cup of frozen peas to the pasta during the last minute of boiling.  And, as I said before, it is good with the peas!",

I started by saut\u00e9ing an onion and 4 cloves of minced garlic. I only used 1.5 tablespoons of Cajun seasoning because I didn't want it to be too hot for my little eaters. I did add defrosted frozen peas to it as another reviewer suggested. Would also be good with Spanish. Everyone loved it in my house!! Will keep recommending this recipe! Mmm!!!",

The recipe also calls for a 14 oz. package of sausage, but Hillshire Farms sausage is now a 12 oz. package so know that in advance.  I will make this again but will most definitely use less cream.",
