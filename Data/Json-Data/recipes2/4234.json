This will center the yolk and when you boil them the yolk will stay there!  If you want the yolk to retain it's natural yellow color instead of getting that icky green rim (although that wouldn't really apply for this recipe), have a bowl of ice cold water filled with more ice ready after you get done cooking the eggs and immediately transfer them to the cold water.  The green rim occurs from a chemical reaction that happens when the yolk is exposed to oxygen.  Rapidly cooling them in the water will stop the reaction from happening, yay! :)",
