I assumed the topping would be dumplings but when I mixed according to recipe the \"batter\" on top was very thin. At first I thought there was a mistake but after cooking I could see that the milk margarine and flour topping is what makes it taste like real pot pie instead of scalloped potatoes. It is a real satisfying dish. For the full effect you could put a crust over the top. Also the recipe does not specify covered or uncovered I did not cover and it was just right.",

Was the batter that is poured on top supposed to be discernible after the dish cames out of the oven? Even though I don't think I did it exactly correctly it had a wonderful flavor. My husband and I agreed that it would make a great homemade chicken soup if I replaced the potatoes with egg noodles and add a bit of cream to hit. I will do that with the leftovers. Also I would also cook my potatoes and carrots a bit as only the smaller pieces were cooked enough. Thanks for a real comfort food whetherit be pie or soup.:-)",
