Not a problem if you're serving a light breakfast or  lunch for two. I made it the day before and just popped it under the broiler before breakfast - very nice taste although I will use more pepper flakes next time. It looks beautiful too, so a lovely dish to serve to guests. Will make it again.",

I also threw in one extra egg when it looked like I wasn't going to have enough mixture to cover my base (I was using an oversized pie plate). Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The crackers were fine. I don't think the extra egg changed much other than the volume. The fresh herbs are a must - that's where all the flavour comes from. With a salad and a glass of wine this is a great 'girl's night in' dish. So pleased.",
