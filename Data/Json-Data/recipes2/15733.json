PERFECT. hints.....do not use as much margarine do not drain the corn cook spaghetti about half down BEFORE mixing it all together use and extra cup of CHEESE..preferably something with a little kick like extra sharp cheddar and MAKE SURE you stir all the spaghetti into it every so often so none of it comes up to the top sticks out and turns into a spear to bite on. It WILL stay soft if you make sure it stays submerged. Great recipe!",

One note that may make a HUGE difference -- It's a bit confusing (at least to me) when in the ingredients it calls for 1/2 a box of spaghetti but in the directions it calls for ONE CUP of broken spaghetti. USE ONE CUP OF BROKEN SPAGHETTI. I used Barilla Angel Hair Pasta and it came out perfectly cooked throughout. I probably did cook it for @45 minutes but it was yummy!!! I'm having it for lunch today reheated as there are only 2 of us eating. Thank you Molly.",

Although he'd rather die that admit when he's wrong he still went back for seconds. As he as a very picky eater guess this means the recipe's a keeper. As recommended by other reviewers I used less margarine and covered mine cooking it for 50 minutes. In addition I took it out of the oven twice while it was cooking to stir -- which I highly recommend -- that kept from having sections of undercooked crunchy noodles.",
