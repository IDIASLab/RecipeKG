I cooked the broccoli in a separate pan with a thin layer of water. I never boil veggies because it leeches the nutrients. I used most of a fresh lemon and a liberal amount of pepper on the chicken as it cooked in a separate pan. When I mixed it all together it still wasn't strong enough so I added a great deal more pepper lemon salt some fresh cilantro and a healthy dose of olive oil. Now that's tasty! Next time I'll try cooking the broccoli and chicken in the same pan for a while to mix flavors.",
