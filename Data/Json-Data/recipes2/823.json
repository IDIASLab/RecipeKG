I omitted the jalapeno (I'm pregnant and can't tolerate super spicy right now) and subbed a few shakes of red pepper flakes, and I used fresh ginger because I don't have ground, and baby bok choy because it's what I had from the CSA. I used half the dressing, and that was plenty. I think the dressing really makes this salad--it's tangy and mustardy, but not overpowering. This would also be great with cabbage instead of bok choy. A definite keeper!",

I gave this three stars instead of two because I think it has great potential - I just need to tweak the dressing a little to suit my tastes. Husband loved it teen son thought it was okay.

First time I made this I followed recipe exactly but with just two minor adjustments based on previous reviews: 1)I only had 20 minutes for it to sit/marinade before serving time. 2)I poured out about a third of the \"vinaigrette\" before serving-other reviews said it was too soggy (and made better for leftovers too!). Five Jalapeno's is very tasty-hot and we loved it but is not for anyone that can't tolerate hot/spicy. I suggest reduce the Jalapeno's to 2 or 4 depending on the company you're serving. The ginger at the end is a nice unique flavor with this salad. Don't forget it. Best easy recipe for Bok Choy yet!",
