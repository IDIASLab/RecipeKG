I made to go along with \"Asian Lettuce Wraps\" and after tasting it I threw it away before it even got to the table and made \"Oriental Dipping Sauce\" from this site instead which was great!  This had WAY too much rice vinegar it just did not taste good at all to me way too overpowering.  Sorry for the terrible review but I've got to be honest.",

We love it which is the reason I'm rating this a five. So, for eggrolls, this recipe is perfect for us. However, tonight I made this for Asian Lettuce Wraps and I have to agree with Matt in that there was too much vinegar for what we were using it for. I only used a tablespoon and it was perfect. I also subbed Hoisin Sauce for the honey.\nThank you Greg!",
