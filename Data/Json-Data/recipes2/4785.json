Easy and it tastes great....and I'm not even a big fan of sweet pickles.  Not sure if it made a difference or not, but I boiled potatoes and eggs yesterday and refrigerated them until I was ready to make the salad today.  I also used mayo, not Hellman's.  Now that I have a great base, I feel more confident to try other flavors, like dill pickles, etc.  Very happy, thank you!",
