It's so easy and it's a great way to use up glazed doughnuts. It leaves you wondering why you'd eat a glazed doughnut any other way! And while it's not for those counting calories - it's OK to indulge once in a while (at least you can say you got a serving of fruit LOL). I did drizzle these with a little chocolate sauce to take them over the top but they're fabulous as is - everyone loved these. This quick and easy recipe is a definite keeper. Thanks voraciousgirl!

I used unglazed and glazed thinking the glazed might be too much but it wasn't. The glazed is definitely the way to go. It is perfect with the tartness of the strawberries. I made a few other changes as well. I sprinkle sugar on my strawberries and let them 'marinate' in the fridge for a few hours to get nice and juicy. I also made my whipped cream in my isi instead of whipping in a bowl. I added a couple more teaspoons of vanilla to give it an extra yummy flavour.",
