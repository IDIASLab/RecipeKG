I cut back the salt and changed it  to kosher salt, as that's what other testers did as well. I also added 1/4 tsp. of ground red pepper, which gave it a bit of a kick. Using buttermilk is key when making this. I might keep experimenting. I plan on adding dill weed next time. EDITED 06/11/08: I added dill weed. That's what's missing. Much better with it. ",

For better taste allow it to mellow in the fridge for about an hour or longer if possible. I used 1/2 fat mayo and 1% Buttermilk. Also when using the amounts stated you get a thick dressing. It looked like more of a dip to me so I added an extra cup of buttermilk to thin it out and a tad more spice to compensate for the additional buttermilk. I REALLY couldn't tell this was a low-fat dressing. My finished dressing was very tasty and turned out to be about 28 calories a tbsp. Next time I want to try fat-free or 95% fat free mayo and see how that tastes. Thanks for the great recipe that has become a keeper for me!",
