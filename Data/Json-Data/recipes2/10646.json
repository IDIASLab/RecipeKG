Rather than basting the kabobs with the sauce I marinated the chicken pieces in the sauce for about 3 hours before threading onto the skewers with the veggies. I also added some mushrooms to the skewers which was a nice addition. These go great with the Uncle Ben's Jasmine rice - which is so quick and easy to use. Would be great for a weeknight dinner!
