I bake a lot of bread, so my wheat was all pretty \"fresh\", and hasn't been sitting on the shelf for years, so that can be ruled out. I could have probably made due with much less moisture if I was kneading by hand (I tried that only once.....). \nIt wasn't until I added that extra moisture that I got a ball of dough instead of crumbs swirling around in the bowl, like some of the other reviewers described. I kneaded it for at least 5 minutes (probably more), I mean why not, it's not like I'm doing it by hand right, leaving a nice spring in the mouth feel of this. \nI really appreciate that this recipe uses ingredients I always have in my pantry. \nIf you are wondering wether or not this is a pasta recipe you want to try, go for it, it's definitely one that I've added to my repertoire.",

I loved it so much I wrote about it on my blog: http://nujoikitchendiary.blogspot.com/2008/01/channeling-lidia.html I used a KA stand mixer for mixing rolling and cutting. Use the paddle attachements to bring the ingredients together. If it isn't coming together properly add a little water. I used a spray bottle but you can also use a spoon to sprinkle it on top of the dough. Be careful to add too much water. As you roll the pasta dough the flour becomes more hydrated so just be patient. (I know that's easier said than done.) The cooked noodles were not heavy at all. They were silky but had a little texture and had a good nutty flavor from the whole wheat flour. Please try this recipe!",

The recipe that I submitted had an additional 1 - 2 Tablespoons of  water and the olive oil should be 2 Tablespoons as well. I make this using my kitchenaid mixer along with the kitchenaid pasta attachment. Just throw everything in the bowl and knead until it comes together. I then hand knead it for a minute or so, then I rub the dough ball with olive oil, cover with plastic, and let it rest 30 mins to 1 hour before I roll it out. I hope this helps.",
