I didn't follow the recipe to a T because I had no peanuts.. so I just increased my oatmeal by 1/2cup and put in 3/4 c. of coconut... I don't think that should have made any difference in how they tasted... but I'm still going with bland. I will stick with no-bake chocolate oatmeal cookies next time made with cocoa instead of chips. Also... I would definately not boil this for 5 minutes like it says.. I was at a minute when it started scorching even though I was stirring constantly. I added a tablespoon of butter to get it to stop scorching but pulled it off after only boiling a minute and a half.. and that was at less than medium heat. Will not make these again.",
