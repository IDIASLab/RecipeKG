I'm giving it a 3 because the chicken had a scary white look to it that will affect presentation if that's important to you. Mostly though I could tell something was missing from this recipe. It needed a kick of some sort. Next time I'll use some lemon seasoning or marinade to see if that helps.",

For those of you having trouble with chicken color you must BROWN your chicken well before moving to next steps. Bone-in chicken holds up best. For the dried herbs soak them in hot water 1/2 hr and hydrate them--use water 2-1 vs dry herbs--with fork squeeze off excess water. Add hydrated herb mixture to mushroom/onion mixture while it's cooking along with fresh minced garlic. Add wine and chicken broth. Bring to simmer. Salt and pepper to taste. No need for all those extra bowls.. Return chicken pieces to covered dutch oven and bake for 45 min @ 350. So easy so delicious!",
