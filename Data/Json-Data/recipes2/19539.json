I could not find another recipe with the name 'Chennai' - although I found a city in India with the same name.... but no more. Our only change.... the first time was - 'when you don't have rice flour use second best..... semolina! - they both contribute to a crispy finish and I have used both flours - leaning toward rice flour as the best but semolina not far behind. Well done sir - our first batch was to tone down the cayenne..... you 'know' why but a great recipe. Thanks You",
