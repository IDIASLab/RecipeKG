I actually ended up using 1 \u00bd  32 oz. boxes of the vegetable stock (48 oz. total), which is a bit more than the recipe calls for, and the soup still came out with a great creamy consistency \u2013 not too thick and not too thin.  Some enhancements I made to the recipe in addition to making it veggie-friendly were to add an extra \u00be C. diced potatoes, 1 can of corn, 3 cloves garlic, some shredded carrot, & substituted a large leek for the onion, which were all great flavor compliments to the potato.  I saut\u00e9ed the celery, shredded carrot, pressed garlic, and the diced leek in a saucepan with some olive oil before adding it to the boiling potato / broth mixture, then followed the recipe from there, adding the canned corn at the end.  I served the soup with a nice green salad and a French baguette.  What a wonderful meal for a cozy night in with my family.  Note:  This would be AMAZING with some dungeness crab meat added - YUM!",

Also added carrots from the garden. We used 2 cans of chicken stock and 1 box of vegetable stock. We then cooked 2 chicken breasts on the bone in water with salt pepper parsley tarragon and some lowerys season salt. Boiled on med heat 30-45 mins let cool and removed from liquid and cooled on plate. I strained out the cooked chicken broth and added broth from cooking potato/veg stock. Into this I added the melted butter and flower. And heated on med. While this heated I removed the skin and bone from chicken breast and set aside and I then shredded the the breast meat. I added the thickened stock into the main pot and added the shredded chicken. I let it on med low heat for 25 more mins. I then let this cool and put in in the fridge for lunch and perhaps supper the next day. It turned out great. I tasted a cup and it would be ready to serve hot or prepare ahead of time and serve later. I nice sour dough loaf or like bread would go well with this meal!",
