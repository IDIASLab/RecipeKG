I gave them a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes, a good grind  of fresh peppercorns, and kept the Sriracha\u00ae the same (maybe a little more the next time).  (Remember, you can always add more, but you can\u2019t take it out once it\u2019s in there.)  The honey-Srirache drizzle is the perfect match for the spiciness of this side dish.",

The Sriracha is all the heat you need in my opinion. The flakes were overkill and ruined it for us. The sprouts got a perfect roasting on them and were downright delicious. I plan to make this again but without the flakes and using equal parts Sriracha to honey and I am convinced this will be my absolute favorite way to eat Brussels sprouts and my go to recipe.
