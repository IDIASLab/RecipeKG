It might not sound good but you wont be able to stop eating these things! \nI add 1 (2.25oz) can of olives and chop those up and add them to the mix, even olive haters don't notice that olives are in the recipe, but it gives the recipe a little salty punch that it really needs.  \nI add a variety of bell peppers (green, red, orange, yellow) to the mix to liven up the color of the appetizer.\nI also use almost 1 cup of the ranch dressing so they don't dry out when cooking.\nENJOY!",

I had a request to make it again for game day the very next day. I have a friend that is completely dairy-free so I made some using dairy-free ranch dressing and homemade almond cheese. Even the people that can have dairy loved the dairy-free version. I had a request to make it again for our next gathering. One of my friends suggested just combining everything into a small casserole dish and serving it as a dip with tortilla chips. I will try it that way next. Great recipie!",
