(I added chicken.)\" To make this a complete meal for us, I added some chicken that I'd marinated in Trader Joe's Soyaki, and didn't quite have the full 2 lbs. of cauliflower and broccoli, so tossed in a cubed zucchini. I probably let the veggies sit in oyster sauce over low heat for more than just \"drizzle and serve\" only b/c I wanted the cabbage softer than al dente, and the chicken needed to warm back up. But what a simple, delicious and healthy meal over brown basmati! Will definitely make again, but would include onions and/or bell peppers too.",
