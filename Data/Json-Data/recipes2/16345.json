Definitely recommend waiting until the last minute to toss with the dressing and in my opinion it is better to add less than you think you need and serve the rest at the table. I could not find white wine vinegar and used white vinegar instead. It worked. I also toasted the almonds before adding to the salad and was sure to drain the mandarins really good! Do NOT save this salad as leftovers! You won't be able to eat it make everyone have seconds! I'm sure they will want to anyway. Great recipe!",

This was so easy to throw together and made for a tasty light summer meal. All I had to do was serve it with warm rolls and a nice glass of wine!
