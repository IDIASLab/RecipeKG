I made some changes & additions I didn't measure out the chicken I just bought a 2lb package of boneless chicken. I didn't want to have fresh tasting chicken so I seasoned my chicken after cutting them up in cubes with garlic powder black pepper cayenne pepper chicken seasoning and a little salt since I know that cream of chicken has a lot of sodium (regular taste better than the low sodium). I didn't need to pre-cook the chicken because they were cut up small enough to cook in the oven but big enough to feel the bite of them. I was making a double amount of the recipe so I also used 1 can of cream of broccoli and a half container of sour cream with a little of water so that the mixture would still be thick but stretch. I added some black pepper and parsley flakes to the creamy mixture to give it some color and depth then added the chicken frozen peas & carrots. After placing them in the biscuits cups I sprinkled pepper flakes to the top for some added zing then the cheese and followed the directions as given. These were also fun to make as my kids helped in the process one doesn't like veggies so I had to put his into some biscuits cups then add the veggies to the mixture. Try these you will enjoy it.",

None of us kids like mixed veggies so she substituted 'flakey' biscuits (our favorite), chopped frozen broccoli for the veggies and cream of broccoli soup and topped with shredded cheddar cheese. When she was feeling particularly patient, she'd even let us kids press the dough into the cupcake tins ourselves. She/we never rolled the biscuit dough out, just patted and formed it into the cupcake tins. Secret tip for moms- kids are more likely to eat something they actually had a hand in making themselves!",

Use low sodium cream of chicken and add more salt accordingly. Add 2 tsp of thyme basil onion powder and garlic powder to the filling. Instead of topping muffin with cheese I mix the cheese in the filling. I also blanch carrots before mix them with other vegetables because half cooked carrots are disgusting. At last the biscuit cup can be as thin as possible to make more pot pies. Otherwise you might have some leftover filling for creamy chicken soup. If you like the result next time try to make biscuit yourself. At last instead of chicken I use leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.",
