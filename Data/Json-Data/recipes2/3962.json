Browned the meat in a dutch oven in batches. Transferred them to the crockpot then did onions as in the original recipe. Added 2 tsp minced garlic for the last minute then browned the flour enough to get rid of flour taste. Deglazed the dutch oven with about half the broth then put it all in the crockpot with the remaining ingredients. About 1 hour on high followed by 4 hours or so on low. When all was done I removed the meat and vegetables to a large bowl de-fatted the liquid then thickened it with a corn starch slurry on the stove top. Served the whole thing over extra-wide egg noodles. Wife said it's a definite keeper.",

I served this over large egg noodles and omitted the sour cream at the end. Next time I will try it with a splash of vinegar to help balance the sweetness but it's still amazing as is. This is a must try! Just be warned that the beets will stain everything so be careful where you choose to cut and peel. Thanks chef John!",
