Place them in a cookie sheet and broil them on high.  Do not walk away, open door, check and turn as needed to brown all sides.  When skins are almost black remove from oven, place in plastic bag to loosen the skin, then peel the peppers. Now you can freeze them, single layer on a cookie sheet, after that place in freezer bag.  Then when you feel like having one they are ready.  They will keep for months in the freezer.",

Follow the same instruction here (toasting and removing the skin( but instead of coating the chiles, cut them into strips and fry them with strips of onion.  Once they are cooked, add the cheese and some cream.  This makes a nice gooey mess that you can eat in tacos.  \r\n",

I dipped each peeled pepper in an egg wash rolled them in Panko bread crumbs and baked at 350 for 10 minutes rather than frying. Delicious! It didn't taste too different from restaurant chile rellenos but was much healthier without all the oil. That said this was quite time consuming but they were fun to make.",

I read other variations that said broil the peppers for 5-10 minutes until the skin is black then remove it under running water instead of frying it twice. I decided to broil it (didn't see the point of frying it stuffing it then frying it again?)and place it in a tightly sealed bowl for 30 minutes to steam the skin off and this way worked really well for us. I used flour and egg for the batter to make it more substantial also. I think this frying method is perfect but next time I will try harder to find the cheese recommended in this recipe. All I could find was queso fresco and it didn't melt well or taste very much like the restaurant versions of chile relleno that we are used too.
