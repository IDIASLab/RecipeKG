We followed the recipe except I left out the bell pepper because by that time the salad was big enough with all the other ingredients. It was okay tasting but very plain. I would add in some other colors next time as all the ingredients are green and it looks plain. Maybe cauliflower instead of broccoli and red pepper instead of green. Also the Dutch would use only mayo in their salad because they really dont' have salad dressing. So since we like it with more I mixed the mayo with red wine vinegar parmesan cheese and a touch of sweetner to kick it up a notch. My husband wasn't brough back to his home country from this meal and being so plain I do not think we would make it again. The eggs are a nice touch though.",
