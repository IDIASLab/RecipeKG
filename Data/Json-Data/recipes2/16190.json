I've hardly used my bag of whole wheat flour for 4 years because everything I ever tried to make with it is dry. These are not dry. They are not sweet either. But they are very high in Fiber and vitamins. I think I'm going to try to add cocoa and some brown sugar to the recipe and choc. chips and try to get my daughter to eat them. I've been dying for a great bran muffin recipe that I don't feel guilty eating. Thanks so much for this. Oh I also just added all liquid ingrediants together and dry together and then added them together. I don't know what size muffins that Alan makes but I made 24 regular muffin cup size muffins not 12. Couldn't find the barley malt flour so I just left it out. All the rest was exactly as the recipe stated.",

Thankyou to Latisha who said it was too dense it was that\"negative feedback\"that made me want to try it.I ve been looking for a dense and flavorful bran muffin and most often the sugar content is so high that is all one tastes. I use a\"gold\" whole wheat flour that I order from wheat Montana it worked well in this recipe and it s chemical-free.I also ground the raisins and then added some additional dried fruit blend consisting of cherries blueberry and strawberry.I also added a scoop of no flavor soy based protein powder and got away with it!

I made a couple of changes too. I used 2 cups of blueberries - WOW! and I didn't have the malt barley flour but I added a tablespoon of flaxseed. My husband really liked these muffins and he hates all things healthy. I almost forgot - with the additional cup of berries - the recipe yeilded 18 muffins. Thanks Jay!",
