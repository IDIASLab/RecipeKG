        "description": "My favorite answer to using the beets from our weekly vegetable delivery. I have used both a spiralizer (Paderno&reg; brand) and an ordinary shredder. I have been creative and used leftover chicken, added saut&eacute;ed kale, garlic-roasted broccoli, and any other number of vegetables I had on hand. Other delightful garnishes are chopped peanuts, shredded purple cabbage, shredded carrot, and/or bean sprouts. This is a flexible recipe that will welcome what you have on hand.",
