The recipe didn't specify how much butter to use, so I used a 1/4 c and sauteed chopped onion, celery (with leaves)and 2 cloves minced garlic.  When the onions were translucent, I stirred in a 1/2 c. of flour and then added 1/2c. white wine and 5 1/2 c. chicken broth stirring with a whisk and had no problem with a thin broth.  I also used fresh chopped carrots and potatoes and frozen corn and beans and cooked all in the stew until softened - adding peas and chopped parsley at the end.  Loved the basil.  Can't wait to serve this again with either dumplings, biscuits or homemade bread.  Very good and filling which makes it a winner at our house.  Thank you!",

I browned the chicken then took it out and added the veggies. I cooked those until soft added the potatoes which I left raw and put chicken back in. Then I added the flour to make a roux from the oil and added the broth and seasonings. I let the stew cook till the potatoes were done. I still like others found the broth too thin so I thickened it with some corn starch and water. Great recipe!",

Time to bring out the warm and flavor filled soups and stews! I was craving a thick hearty stew and I completely found it in this recipe! As always I deviated from the recipe but in essence they are the same! I love onions and garlic so I doubled the amount within. I also added zucchini and greenbeans to the recipe. For the seasonings I substituted sage for oregano thyme rosemary and Adobo. I sauteed the chicken with Adobo poultry seasoning and italian seasoning blend. I added a little bit of flour to thicken the consistency and VOILA! a delicious soup that my friends could not help but taste. I highly recommend this recipe for those windy wonderful fall days....Enjoy!!!",
