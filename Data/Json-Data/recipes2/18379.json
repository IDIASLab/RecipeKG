I had a similar recipe that had one shortcut in it...that one you slated the eggplant and let it drain in a colander over the sink...so I did that for step one since it was simpler. I just used plastic wrap with pie weights in it on top on the colander/veggies. I did use the sundried tomatoes and basil that were \"optional\" since I like both. I originally gave this a 4 but bumped it up to a 5 because both my husband and daughter who do not like eggplant actaully took seconds. We all had the same comment though: It tastes like olives! Probably due to the brine treatent. But that did giveme the idea that when I make it again next time I am actually going to PUT black olives in the marinade with it. Eggplant and olives are a good combo and it will look pretty.",

                "reviewBody": "I have been looking for a recipe for this salad for years!  We once were able to buy it at our favorite Italian market in Philly.  Sadly, they stopped making it.  They might have had a few more ingredients in theirs such as parsley and chopped red peppers and I will try those additions next time.  The amount of salt in this is also way to much.  A few tablespoons is more than enough and will still draw out the water and subdue the bitterness. The recipe is more complicated than necessary.  Simply set the eggplant in a bowl with the salt and place a plate over top that fits snugly into the bowl.  Add another flat bottom pot on top and fill with water. Let sit about 4 hours, stir a time or two and continue with the recipe.  I did not do all the heavy squeezing but did press out most liquids.  The salad need not sit for one month either.  It is ready as early as 24 hours.  Delicious salad - I will be making this often, with my adjustments and additions! **UPDATE** made again but used MUCH less salt, about 1/4 cup.   I placed everything in a ziplock bag and squeezed out the air and refrigerate overnight.  Rinsed in the bag, squeezed in the bag and continued with the recipe.  So much easier than the recipe method!",
