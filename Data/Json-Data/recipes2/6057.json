Then, I continued to be intriguing when I discovered it indeed WASN'T some variation of an italian dressing pasta salad.  I realized I had a little less than a cup of light mayo left, so mine wasn't as dressed as it should be.  Per personal taste, I subbed yellow mustard for Dijon and left out the celery and black olives, while I added some carrot.  I belatedly realized I'd left out the eggs, but next time (and yes, there WILL be a next time) I'll use pickled eggs!  Oh yeah, I'm also lazy, so I subbed \"real bacon bits\" for bacon.  THANK YOU for a great *different* pasta salad, KB COUNTRYGIRL!  EDIT:  I made this again and added chopped pickled eggs and that was a nice *pop*, both in flavor and color.  I also made using green onions, as opposed to red, since I was making it for a crowd ad green tend to be a bit milder and I really missed the crunch, and bite, of the red onion.",
