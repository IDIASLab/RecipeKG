I did mix it in a zip lock bag, but then put them on a cookie sheet and baked them at 250 for about 15 minutes.  That way it soaks up all the liquid.  Please try it!",

I shook them till they were covered sprinkled the spice mix (that I used Morton's Hot Salt instead of the cayenne in) over top of them and stuck them in the oven at 325 for probably 15 minutes stirring a few times.

I've actually been using THIS recipe for years now.  Thought the least I could do was give it a rating!!  The ingredients are really a base and can (obviously) be adjusted to taste.  I actually use two full 15 oz bags of pretzels instead of the 1 1/2 suggested.  I also use garlic powder vs garlic salt and extra cayenne pepper as we like this with a bit more 'bite'.  Also, I reduce the oil to 1/2 cup.  (wondering if olive oil would work...  ~idk why not!!)  Everyone LOVES this recipe and I really think the lemon pepper is the \"secret\"!!  I too have given this out as gifts and everyone requests it for parties, on game days, etc!  Thank you.",
