I preheated my cast iron skillet so that when i laid the chicken in it, the bottom/thighs got a nice sear (keeps the dark meat cooking at same rate as white).  Then, after about 30 minutes on the high heat, i shut the oven all the way off and let the chicken sit in the cooling oven for another 20 minutes.  This lets it continue to cook, but will taper off and seal the juices in.  Just don't open the door!  This chicken turned out so beautiful golden brown, crispy outside, super moist and tender inside.  Thank you chef, for the courage to use so much salt!  :))",

This recipe was a nice change up from my usual rosemary and garlic roasted bird.\nIt did turn out rather salty, and I used coarse ground kosher salt - but it wasn't inedible salty. (and of course, I expected it to be salty!) I prepared this in my infrared oven which I believe helped the skin to crisp very nicely. The whole thing was a beautiful, uniform golden color. My husband, teenage daughter and I loved the sauce, but my young children didn't care for the lemon flavor of it, so next time I will try making it with white wine in place of the lemon juice. This recipe is a keeper that I will make again and again.",
