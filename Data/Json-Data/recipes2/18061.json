It turned out absolutely sublime the sauce was very piquant and flavourful. I threw some chopped cilantro on the top to serve and some creamy mashed potato on the side and it was awesome my husband who is a big seafood lover was very impressed. This one is a keeper I will definately be making it again. Thank you Maria for a truly awesome recipe!!",
