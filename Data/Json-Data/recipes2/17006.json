Guess I should dry some mint because we really liked this recipe and I will be making it again.  It was the first time I marinated meat in yogurt.  It was very good but the yogurt made it more difficult to determine when the meat was cooked as I usually use herbs and olive oil which browns up quickly.  Thanks for the recipe. I served it with basmati rice with Persian seasoning, tzatziki and pita.  Next time I will take your advice and grill some vegetables to round out the meal.",

The onion needs to be in tiny pieces for the best flavor.  ",
