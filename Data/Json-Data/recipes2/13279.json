Added chicken breast chunks I seared first and then baked along w other. Delicious and better the next day.",

On the recommendation of the cheese lady our local grocery store (Thank You Piazzas!), we used Queso Fresco because it\u2019s less salty.  Also, in place of the Fajita seasons, we used the same quantity of McComicks Fajita seasoning mix from an envelope.  We can\u2019t wait to try it again on guests.",

The cauliflower and the rest of the vegetables requires a very large bowl to mix everything. I used a 12 quart pot for pasta to do this and everything occupied half the pot. Baking reduces the bulk of the vegetables substantially. Only changes I made to the recipe was to use 2 red peppers rather than one and increase the beans to two can. I baked the beans separately from the rest of the vegetables for the last 15 minutes of cooking. I will definitely make this again.",
