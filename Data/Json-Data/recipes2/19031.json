I not only discovered that instant pudding doesn't work with non-dairy creamer, but it DOES create the base for the richest, tastiest, no-cholesterol egg nog I've ever tasted! Because there are no raw eggs, it's also safer that the traditional.",

My biggest complaint is that it tastes too artificial and more like a vanilla drink rather than eggnog. Another point is that it ends up costing more than the bottles of eggnog that you can buy at the supermarket that I think taste better. There's no cost savings to making your own. After refrigeration it thickened (like pudding should do) so I added milk and re-blended to reach the right consistency. Sorry Joy this one just didn't work for me. We drank it but I doubt I'll make again.",
