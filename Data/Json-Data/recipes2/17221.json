This recipe is not the best I've had, but it's very good.  It's still coleslaw, but with a fun and adventuresome Tex-Mex twist.  It was a bit dry upon first mix, but after adding a dab of extra ranch dressing and after it sat for awhile, it became plenty \"wet.\"  So, I may not have needed to add more ranch dressing after all.  The kick is about right for me.  Please note:  The cilantro flavor is prominent, nearly dominating the taste.  Like my wife, if you aren't a fan of cilantro--reduce it or leave it out.  I'm not a big fan of cilantro, but in this salad--it just works.",
