It was a lil difficult to keep the ingredients inside while rolling them up and after it baked I thought it needed more of the taste inside. Maybe I will follow the directions and not put the sauce inside just use it for dipping. I also cut the pepperoni up to make it easier to put them inside. I topped them with some cheese half way thru the baking process. Thank you!",
