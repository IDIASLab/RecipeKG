Brasciole can be made with pork veal or beef but the key is whichever meat you use it has to be extremely thin otherwise it will be difficult to roll and may not get as tender as it should. Brasciole is a versatile recipe as you can really play around with the stuffing ingredients i.e different cheeses capicola my grandmother used to put hard boiled egg in hers (cheaper than pine nuts!!)",

A couple of suggestions to make this easier and tastier: mix the onion mixture with the bread crumb mixture and add enough EVOO to make it bind and then spread it on the meat. I also used panko bread crumbs and Italian seasoning to give the stuffing more flavor. I used toothpicks to keep them all together and they worked great. Add a little bit of red wine to the spaghetti sauce for flavor and use the crock pot for very tender meat. I was in a hurry so I used the high setting for 5 hours and it came out perfect. I will definetly make this again!",

So kudos to Debra for getting this to taste right because it is quite a tricky recipe but fantatsic when it's done. It took some time to tenderize the meat and get the ingredients the way I needed them but after rolling the meat and getting them simmering in the sauce it's just a waiting game. I substituted dried cranberries for raisins which were tart and sweet and my dad and sister's favorite parts of the inner stuffing. A wonderful Sunday meal to make with extra pasta I had lying around the kitchen.",
