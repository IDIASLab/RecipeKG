I'm glad I read the reviews, there are a few pifalls to avoid: 1- wait until the batter hardens a little before you mix in the chocolates\n2- spray or grease your cookie sheet.  The chocolates don't stick in the batter very well, you have to work it a little to make sure they don't fall off, but it's worth it, this is a great recipe!",

I chilled in the fridge for 45 mins then added the chocolate. I only had about 1C. of M&M's so I also used some white chocolate chips and regular chocolate chips. It added some extra flavor and my kids loved them! I rolled them into balls and baked them. They held the shape perfectly and didn't come out flat at all! Make sure you don't melt the butter just soften. That is a mistake a lot of people make when baking cookies! I will make these again. Thanks for the recipe!",

I agree with a lot of the people who mentioned them being very \"soupy.\" I would say they are very \"sticky.\" However the flavor is outstanding. They taste good enough for me to try to make these again. i will put the dough in the fridge and follow all the other comments that were made. Don't give up on this recipe. The flavor is worth making it again. I do have to agree that it isn't a cookie for company. The typical look of a cookie doesn't happen with this one. But it tastes great. I normally don't buy coconut or the sweetened condensed milk so this won't be an \"all the time\" cookie. My main problem that I had was trying to get these bad boys off the pan. Will definitely grease the pan even though it says not to.",
