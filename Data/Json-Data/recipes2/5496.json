Oh and no LOL packets so olive oil and minced garlic some tarragon and basil. So with those mods it came out really well. Sauteed sliced leek then garlic then mushrooms and herbs then added the kale last. The flavors and textures blended well. My son isn't a fan of kale so he gives it 3.5 stars but my vegetarian daughter and I give it 5 so 4 overall.",
