Because I'm very familiar with this classic cream cheese frosting, what happened with this is just what I expected, so I should have known better.  If you're looking for a rather thin glaze, then 5 T. of bourbon might  work just fine.  However, if you want a nice, thick, spreadable *frosting,* then 5 T. of bourbon is at least 4 T. too much.  I used 1 T., and found I still had to add extra powdered to make it stiffer.  With only that 1 T. of bourbon, we were not able to taste it at all.  Whether you use bourbon or any other liquid in this cream cheese frosting recipe, start out adding a little at a time - and certainly not 5 tablespoons!",
