Brushed sauce halfway too.\" Mine came out way darker than those of the other recipe photographs, perhaps b/c I marinated it for 3 hrs. as opposed to 12 min., and I brushed the marinade that I'd set aside on top when I flipped the tofu at 15 min. It's not a very complex or thrilling marinade, but  when I cubed and ate the tofu over a spinach salad, it was nice that it didn't have overly complicated flavors to compete w/ the nice greens. Having said that, I wouldn't serve it as written by itself as a main dish - perhaps stir-fried, or like I made it (over a salad.)",
