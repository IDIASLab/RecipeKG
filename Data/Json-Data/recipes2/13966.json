I put the hot dogs in and then a layer of cheese over those. Then the chili and some more cheese. My buns didn't get to soggy at all, as a matter of fact, the bottom was just a little crispy and it was fantastic. Maybe because the crust was facing up, or the layer of cheese between the hot dogs and the chili? I did use two cans of chili though.This tastes just like it should and I will be making this for a long time to come. Thanks for a great recipe!!",

                "reviewBody": "Delicious & fun dinner idea!  My husband and I really enjoyed this. My children (11 & 5 yrs.) had mixed reviews.  They ate it, but their biggest criticism was the bread.  I guess they're purists (hot dogs ON buns, not the other way around, etc.).  I did use Hormel's low-fat Turkey Chili, and found that two cans would have been better than the one that I used.  Next time, instead of hot dog buns, I think I'll try using a prepared cornbread stuffing mix which would be crispier than the cut-up buns (although, I did lightly butter and toast them before adding the rest of the ingredients, but they still absorbed too much moisture from the chili than my kids liked).  Thanks for the idea, and I will be making this again. UPDATE ON 6/28/06:  WE HAVE TWEAKED THIS CHILI DOG CASSEROLE TO EVERYONE'S LIKING...LAYERED IN THIS ORDER:  2 OR 3 CANS OF HORMEL TURKEY CHILI W/O BEANS; 1 PACKAGE OF LOW FAT OR FAT FREE BEEF FRANKS CUT UP, DICED ONIONS, 1/2 PACKAGE LOW FAT SHREDDED CHEDDAR/MONTERAY JACK; 2 PREPARED PACKAGES OF JIFFY CORNBREAD MUFFIN BATTER SPREAD ON TOP, THEN FINISH W/ REMAINING CHEESE AND BAKE.  EVERYONE LOVES THIS, AND I THANK YOU FOR INSPIRING ME!  GREAT RECIPE IDEA!",

One 15 oz. was barely enough to spread a smear over the top. This then will feed a football team! So if you're looking for around 4 servings use 4 hd buns 4 weiners and one can of chili in an 8x8 dish. For little kids or really hungry boys this might be an ok recipe - but for myself husband and 13 year old daughter - we'll pass and buy a chili dog at Weinerschnitzel!!",
