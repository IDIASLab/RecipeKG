I know I am not alone in this but I hate the breading I worked so hard to get perfect going soggy. Lay down your preferred pasta top with the sauce then lay the squid on top... I'd watch for the steaks curling up on you when they cook because it makes it harder not burn some parts and cook others when they refuse to lay flat. Next time I think I will cut my steaks in 1\" strips (They're not as small as calamari but not as big as steaks) As Goldy Locks would say \"just right\"... I stuck to the recipe pretty good but some additions I would reccomend are adding a few dashes of lemon juice to your basting milk and some cayenne to your breading (tang zip = perfect for seafood). And then depending on what sauce you choose I always like to sautee up some garlic and onion with a few spices before adding the sauce and letting it simmer... Try this recipe out... It's different but its nice...",
