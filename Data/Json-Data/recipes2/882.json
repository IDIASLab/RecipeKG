What can I say...\"mouthwatering, flavorful, moist\", I was almost giddy by the end of the meal because my boyfriend kept commenting how delicious this version of meatloaf is.

I don't think this recipe needs the extra boost.  I had to laugh at the review that said this made too much meatloaf.  She should see how my tall, hulking sons pile food on a plate.",

The brown sugar apple cider Dijon topping was to die for. I put it on when there was about 45 minutes left because I wanted to make sure all the vinegar was cooked off. The tarragon was a delightful and interresting surprise. The family loved it and went back for seconds. I've made chef John's other meatloaf that involves using a lot of vegetables, which I enjoyed as well, but this one was a lot easier though likely not as healthy",
