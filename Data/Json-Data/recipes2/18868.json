I know the recipe calls for chopping the red peppers and adding at the end but to hide them from my children (who wouldn't eat this if they saw peppers) I dumped all the ingrediens (except parsley) in the food processor. The taste is wonderful it reminded me of the pimento cheese spread thats so wonderful and costly... ALL my kids loved this and I can see this would be equally delicious rolled in chopped pecans. Thanks for a great recipe!",

Previous reviewers are right; it's better with increased amounts of cayenne garlic and my own personal preference a touch more Worchestershire sauce. I also took the advice from the reviewer who added some dijonnaise. I added about a teaspoon. I let my food processor do the work and found that it was much easier to form into a more presentable ball after it had been chilled for at least an hour. Then I coated it in slivered almonds and it looked soooooo beautiful! The almonds helped with the ball formation as I was coating it; it provided a \"wall\" of sorts holding everything together. Thanks so much for the recipe - I can't wait to serve it tomorrow!",

I wasn't a huge fan of the fresh parsley though...my suggestion is to either chop it SUPER fine or to use nuts instead.",

I also used the shredded Mexican 4-cheese blend (my personal fav) instead of shredded Cheddar. This has a taste similar to pimiento cheese so to make sure it had more of a cheese ball taste I added a little minced onion seasoned salt and large spoonful of Dijonaise (Dijon mayo-blend). I'd refrigerate overnight to ensure the flavors meld. It's such a pretty cheese ball next time I might not roll in nuts or parsley! The recipe is definitely a keeper.",
