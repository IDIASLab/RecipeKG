I was so excited when I tasted the final product of this recipe because it was absolutely perfect!\n\nI added chopped onions and green peppers, and omitted the mushrooms.  I also had to use extra chicken stock to thin it out. I served it over rice like they do in Ghana. And instead of using raw chicken breast, I bought a whole roasted chicken, carved it up and poured the stew over whole pieces of drumstick/thigh, and then shredded up the rest to add to the stew. Delicious! My boyfriend and my roommate (both of whom have never had African food before) devoured it and are already asking me to make more.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  \n\nYou definitely helped satisfy my craving for Ghanaian food",

This makes a much more intense and complex flavor. Also instead of chicken any kind of meat that is on hand can be used - beef pork ham goat lamb or even tofu. If you enjoy a bit of texture use chunky peanut butter. This is an extremely versatile dish so use your imagination.",
