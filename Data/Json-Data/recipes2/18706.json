I did not cut the steak into strips prior to cooking as this can really dry the meat. Instead I just set my broiler on a medium broil and cook it 11 minutes on both sides. Cooking it this way makes it come out a perfect medium rare. If your steak is getting burnt around the edges then you are cooking it too close to the broiler or at too high of a setting. Fabulous! I will defintely serve this again...with my additions though.",
