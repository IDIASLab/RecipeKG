I did put mine in a 9x9 pan so they'd be thicker and wound up baking them for about an hour and 5 or so minutes to account for the extra thickness.  \nI did sub in almond milk due to what I had on hand and it was delicious!  I might add walnuts to these next time but honestly, they were great just like this and I usually have the ingredients on hand.  Plus, they smell amazing when they're cooking!",
