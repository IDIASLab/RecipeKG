Otherwise I followed the recipe ingredient list. As I noticed the loaf achieving the coloring that appealed to me after 30 minutes I relocated it from the top oven rack to the lower rack and cooked for another 10 minutes. Since I had not added egg there really was not anything to undercook. Forty minutes seemed quiet sufficient.",
