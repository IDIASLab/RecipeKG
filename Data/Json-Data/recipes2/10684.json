Therefore I had to wing it on a couple of ingredients. Frozen corn filled in for the fresh and cucumbers had to fill in for the avocado as I was fresh out. As for the cilantro I don t know exactly how much I added but I know it wasn t a bunch no matter how you choose to define that. I added a much smaller amount an amount that looked right to me. I also appreciated that this recipe didn t have to rely on garlic. It was a happy accident that I ended up making this at the last minute it really was very good just don t forget salt and pepper.",
