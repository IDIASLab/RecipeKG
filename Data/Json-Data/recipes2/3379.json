I dropped my jalapenos in hot water for 30 second and rinses them to precook them. I tried these on a hinged top grill like a George Forman, I don't recommend it, it oozed out everywhere, but a grill pan works great also thick cut bacon tastes great, but the slices do not wrap well and I recommend keeping with normal bacon slices. I dip them in warmed raspberry jam.",

For the first time I made the filling exactly as the recipe states. I was surprised the cream cheese filling didn't melt and drip all over the oven especially because you place them cheese-side-down on the sheet. I didn't have jalape\u00f1os in the garden (they were not ready yet) so I used Big Jim and Anaheim peppers and they worked wonderfully. Will use the jalape\u00f1o next time for friends who like that extra \"zing\" in their food. (Note: others have added different kinds of cheeses; I can see where a real sharp cheddar would be a great addition especially if you use a more mild pepper.)",

I was running late so instead of baking I used the broiler about 10 min then flip and 10 min more. It worked out I just had to watch it like a hawk to make sure they didn't burn. I would highly recommend baking or grilling instead! I would also recommend using gloves while cutting and cleaning the peppers you don't even realize that juice is on your hands until your eye itches and it is too late.",
