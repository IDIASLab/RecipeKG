I found that the macaroni required more mayo/dressing that was called for to be of the right consistency. Also rather than using regular onion which overwhelms the dish green onions or chives would be a better choice. My personal preference is to leave the onions out completely and add garlic powder dill and crumbled bacon and use three cheese ranch as the dressing of choice. Other good toss-ins would be: mustard pickle relish cubed ham peas diced turkey or chicken snow peas sesame seeds cherry tomatoes or celery.",
