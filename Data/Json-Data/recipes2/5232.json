No need to fiddle with the spices, they are perfectly balanced. The overall taste is a rounded flavor with no particular one spice pushing its way forward. The main difference, naturally, is the meat. You choose yours with the fat content and mix that you want. I used veal, pork and turkey.  I made half into patties and left the rest in bulk using the latter for gravy.  I combined all the spices in my mortar and gave them a jab or two before adding to the meat. Thank you for the recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "This is by far the best breakfast sausage I have ever had! Most all of the major brands have entirely too much sage which is a big turn off for us but this recipe has just the right amount. Not only the sage but all of the other spice measurements are spot on as well. I did make one change due to some meat I had in the freezer that was needing used. I substituted one pound of the ground pork for a pound of venison sausage which was mixed 50% venison 50% pork fat. I fried 8 of the patties last night and stuck the other in the freezer for later use. The patties hardly shrank at all and everything about them was very impressive. The difference in this compared to the store bought junk that is filled with preservatives is mind blowing really. Thank you for sharing Jan!",

The molasses was really gripping my nose & I wasn\u2019t finding the herby aroma of the sage.  I let the meat mixture set over night to find the molasses had calmed but still not finding the sage aroma that\u2019s normal for sausage.   I prep\u2019d for breakfast & to my surprise, the seasonings were perfect!  I MAY go a tiny bit sage heavier next time but the recipe is amazing. You will not be disappointed.
