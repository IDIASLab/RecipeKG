I found the boullion and onion flakes to be very reasonably priced and I didn't have to make several trips to the grocery store. Also I've found that Mason jars are \"seasonal\" items and you may not find them in the dead of winter...I located them at a 'grain & feed' store which stocks them year 'round.:)",

It made a great gift. Try processing dried tomatos with the seasoning in a food processor. The resulting seasoning mix can be pressed into a circular cake and used as a layer in the jar. This year I plan to further modify the seasoning mix to include freeze-dried refried beans and \"tex/mex-ify\" the herb blend. I'll add dehydrated corn and black beans to the dried lentils etc. My hope is to turn out a southwest chili-style version and rename the outcome Sopa Agape Noche Buena (Holy night brotherly love soup) or something like that.",
