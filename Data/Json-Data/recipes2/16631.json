                "reviewBody": "This will be a definite winner if you make a few changes - very easy: - use cubanelle green peppers - they provide the most flavor and this is the type of pepper we have and always use in Russia - instead of chopping slice the onions and peppers - this will provide for a better flavor and nicer texture - put sliced onions pepper and dill (may increase to 2 tsp ) into a salad bowl put salt (1/2 tsp or to taste) and with your hands mix them together lightly pressing on the vegetables in order for them to give a little juice - but do not press too much so that they don't lose their firmness - this step is the key actually! Once that is done add chopped tomatoes with all the juice. I usually take tomato in one hand and cut off small slices right above the salad bowl (do not lose the juice and seeds!). - After that you can actually go 2 ways: either add 2 tablespoonfuls of sour cream (together with the vegetable juices you've got in the bowl it will make plenty of dressing) or you can add 2 tablespoons of oil (canola vegetable but not olive oil). You may add some lemon juice to taste to the oil version. Both salads (with either oil or sour cream) are awesome if done this way. Please try!",

You'll be able to tell. It should be mixed the same as something like tuna salad or potato salad.",
