This would be a perfect dish for Christmas morning when the house is full of excited kids! It would turn their attention from gifts to food. You did such a great job in the Dinner Spinner show and the decision between your dish and Cliff's was VERY hard! Your dish is definitely 5star and my guests this morning at our watch party LOVED it. I live at altitude so it took longer to cook in my oven -- almost twice as long. Next time I'll also try this with fresh spinach versus cooked. Definitely making this again and can't wait for my nieces and nephews to come over for it!",
