As long as the end product tastes good, the endevour has been a success.  Several of the reviews mentioned that the \"pie\" was bland. This was my clue to expermient. So I put in some things to give it a kick.  First I added a can of cream corn (cause I really like corn) as several reviewers mentioned and I used mushroom soup instead of veggy soup, then three cloves of finely cut garlic. In the potatoes, I added milk and a LARGE tablespoon of creamy horseradish sauce (anything with the word horse in it should give it a \"kick\"). I added a dash or two of worchestershire sauce and a dash or three of garlic salt. I tossed in a can of white beans (this one gave it a real boost and I highly recommend concidering the beans as an additive). I also used more than the three cups of potatoes. I used three good sized russet potatoes. I have no idea what Colby longhorn cheese is, so I had some medium chedar that I used. The end product of this concoction was absolutely delicious! My wife, who is kinda pickey, had three helpings and I had four. Between the two of us we ate three quarters of the \"pie\" at one sitting!! This was really, really good and full of great flavors. Thank you Lisa for a great recipe idea.",

I used a little less thyme then it called for and used condensed golden mushroom soup. I totally forgot to add the onion and celery while cooking the burger, so I sauteed them in a little butter afterwards and added it to the burger & soup mix. I layered the hamburger, then corn, then the potatoes and WOW, it was so good! There were 4 adults (very hungry ones!) and the entire 9x13 pan was gone. My dad said it was the best he ever had...even better then my mom's (which is saying a lot!) I'm making it again for Sunday football...hope there's enough! Thanks for the great recipe!",

I like this recipe becasue it is your \"basic\" shepherd's pie recipe, so you can add or take away what you like. I spruced up my meat mixture a little more by adding chopped bell pepper, canned tomatoes and garlic to my ground meat.  It makes it a little heartier, and  I like to flavor my mashed potatoes with some garlic and onion powder.  I don't measure out the cheese...I just throw lots and lots on top. I would definitely recommed using this recipe as your foundation, and then play around with it. Thanks Lisa.",

I always use instant pototoes (SO much faster than the other kind and I can't really tell a differenc) and pour on the thyme because I love the unique flavor.
