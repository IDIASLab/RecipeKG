I made a few changes: I used 2 cans of chicken (12.5 oz each), 2 stalks of celery finely chopped, I didn't use blue cheese or ranch dressing instead I used 1 16oz container of sour cream and a packet of ranch dip seasoning and made the ranch dip. I added it all to the mix. The ranch dip has a better taste than the dressing to me. All in all the dip was a hit at girls night....they are already asking me to make it for our next get together :)",

I dont like blue cheese and usually use ranch when eating wings...but I used both as the recipe stated and it didnt have too strong of a blue cheese-y flavor so I liked it. Only thing was that I couldnt figure out how long to sautee the celery because it never seemed to get \"soft\" and I actually couldnt even tell it was in the dip when I tasted it (no one else could either) so I think it could easily be left out and just use celery to dip in..or else have the pieces bigger if you want to actually taste it in the dip. Also I used more hot sauce than it called for -- about 3/4 cup and I noticed that it seemed to be really greasy/runny when I took it out of the oven and I think it was just all the extra sauce had settled on the top and I had to sop a lot out with a paper towel..not sure how to avoid that if you want more hot sauce. Everyone commented that it was pretty hot but they still came back to keep eating more! I think it tastes good with crackers and celery although the crackers seemed better since the dip was more on the runny side. I will definitely be making this again!",
