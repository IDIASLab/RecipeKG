So here's what I did: I made my Rice first (1 cup Jasmine), cooking it stove-top (for 12 minutes, covered) in 2.5 cups of water to which I had added 2 Tbls. \"Better Than Bouillon\" (I used Vegetable; but Beef or Chicken could be used instead; bouillon cubes or granules or cartoned stock can be used, also). While the Rice was cooking, I chopped the Bok Choy. Once the Rice was cooked,  I added the Bok Choy plus 2 Tbls. grated Parmesan cheese to its pot, stirred it up a bit and set it aside (covered) to \"sit\" (10 minutes). While the Rice was \"sitting\",  I cooked the onion, some minced Garlic and the Sausage as  described above.  Let's face it -- this dish is never going to be Lasagna, Chicken Cordon Bleu or whatever your favorite meal is. But it is healthy and economical. And -- with the adjustments I made -- both my DH and I  thought it was quite flavorful, too. Enjoy. :)",

I'm not sure what but it needs a couple more ingredients. The grease from the sausage wasn't enough to flavor the bok choy. If serving over rice as I did it needs a sauce. This has potential but as written it is bland. Sorry.",
