The skin got \"fleshy\" again after cooking in the oven so next time I think I will skin the chicken first. (or maybe even deep frying the chicken with a batter on it. I bet that would glaze deliciously!) I used ketchup and mayonaisse (not miracle whip!) instead of dressing peach preserves only and kinda made up my own \"onion soup/seasoning\" mix. I will definitely make this again thank you! Very good.",

I used chicken breasts (boneless) and drumsticks instead of a whole chicken. The potatoes and sauce I kept exactly the same. After baking for the recipe's 40 and 15 minutes I had to bake another 35 minutes until the chicken was done. Then the potatoes were still not done and I even cut them in quarters instead of halves so they should have cooked even faster. THe sauce in itself has a great flavor. I love the combination. But it didnt really get into the chicken much (maybe it shoudl be marinated first?) and the chicken was SO moist - it was TOO moist. I think these should be browned first b/c the chicken is almost soggy. I think this sauce is a keeper but it just cant be baked the way it says in the recipe in my opinion. If I choose to use the sauce again I'll use it with a pork tenderloin or marinate the chicken in it and then brown the chicken first before baking it. I'll also bake at 325 first instead of 300 before upping it to 375. And the potatoes will be separate next time - or cut in even smaller pieces. Too bad! Looked good.",
