But after reading the other reviews I was concerned that the crescent rolls would be soggy or too much. I also used light mayo because I don't care for miracle whip. This recipe doesn't make a whole lot. See one of my photos with the spoon for size comparison. This is a small spoon (smaller than a teaspoon), so you can see it doesn't make much. It is absolutely delicious though and the easiest thing in the world to make. This is great cold by the way, though definitely better warm. Next time I will broil it for just a minute or two after baking to brown the top a little. Highly recommended.",
