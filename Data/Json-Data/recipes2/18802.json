I toasted the whole grain bread first and it had a nice light crunch which was complimented by the sweetness of fresh fruit. Very easy and very tasty! Next time I might even add in a little sliced banana or try different fruit and jam combinations.",

I made these using whole wheat bread and spreading some cream cheese on each side with thinly sliced strawberries in the middle. I used a large flower cutter as big as the bread then cut them in half assembling them in full flowers on the plate. Everyone raved and they were the first item gone....even a toddler there with his mother loved them. A definte keeper and perfect with cucumber sandwiches for a light sweet alternative sandwich.",
