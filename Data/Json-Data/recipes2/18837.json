Adding chicken broth instead of the traditional water gives it a WONDERFUL flavor. I've also made it using cream instead of milk (yum!), and I've just sprinkled a little cheese on top instead of mixing a whole cup of it in. It's also good with sauteed mushrooms on top.

                "reviewBody": "This is an excellent basic polenta recipe. Polenta has a history aa a staple in the Northern Italian diet - especially in the Asiago area - the home of my maternal grandparents. The terms \"polentone\" - meaning \"full of polenta\" and \"mangiapolenta\" meaning \"eat polenta\" are used by Southern Italians in reference to those of Northern Italy. The following recipe modifications will bring polenta to an even more elevated level: Bring 4 cups of milk with 0.5 cup of whipping cream to a boil without scalding. Reduce the mixture to a simmer. Slowly add 1 cup of  Quaker cornmeal. With a wooden spoon, stir the mixture.In the old days, the stirring was alloted to the man of the house - the thickening cornmeal can become quite resistant to stirring. Lumps will have a tendency to form. I have found that an electric hand blender will obviate these problems and will result in a smooth, lumpless (homogeneous), creamy polenta. I continue the process for 30 to 45 minutes. I then add 4 TBS of butter to the hot polenta and continue with the blender for another 5 minutes. I then add 0.5 cup of grated pecorino romano cheese. I continue with the blender for another 5 minutes. The finished polenta is then poured onto a large buttered platter. After the polenta has hardened, it is cut - like a pie -  into sections and served with a variety of toppings. Left-over polenta can be served for breakfast: powder the slices with flour, fry in butter, and serve with maple syrup. ",

It was a little runny when I first took it out of the oven but if you let it sit several minutes before cutting it thickens up. P.S. Muir Glen's Fire Roasted Tomato pasta sauce is our family's favorite. I highly recommend it if you don't have time to make your own. Actually it's better than my own. UPDATE: The second time I made this I decreased the milk and stock by 1/2 cup each. This turned out much better. The polenta was firm and could be cut into pieces (the longer it sits outside the oven the firmer it gets). The parmesan flavor stood out a tad more too. I just can't get enough of this....YUM! The leftovers are just as good if not better.",

I used 1 cup cream as I had it on hand and needed to use it up and didn't have milk. I used 3 C. chicken broth and only 1/2 C. shredded Asiago cheese. It was so yummy I wanted to eat it just like that and I don't usually like polenta plain. I didn't bake it because my grandmother who came from Italy (never did learn to speak English) would make polenta pour it onto a dinner plate and smooth it out make a little ridge around it like a pizza crush might have and spread homemade spaghetti sauce in the middle up to the ridge with a sprinkling of Parmesan Cheese and serve it with lots of Italian Sausage cut into 2\" lenghts cooked in the sauce. Heaven. This polenta would be great with just about anything over it - I plan to try roasted veggies with it. Thanks - this recipe is a keeper!",
