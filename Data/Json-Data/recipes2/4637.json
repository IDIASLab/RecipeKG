The only change I made was to add chocolate shavings to the top for presentation. If you really want to kick the recipe up add finely chopped pecan pieces to your Graham cracker crust.. That's what Copeland's does to all of their cheesecakes. That extra element of nutty flavor kicks everything up a notch.",
