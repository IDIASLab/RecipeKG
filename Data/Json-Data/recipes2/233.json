A workable substitute is 1/8 teaspoon each ground cinnamon, ground cloves, ground ginger, black pepper, and anise OR fennel seeds.",

The last few minutes of cooking I turned the oven to broil. I like my roasted carrots to have some slight browning in places. Be careful not to over-do it and watch carefully if you decide to broil at the end. I've walked away for a minute before and came back to ruined vegetables! The whole family loved these carrots; even the young kids! I've seen some low rated reviews based off not liking Chinese Five-Spice. For those of you who have never tried five spice, it comes in many variants but the most common mixture contains Star anise, Cloves, Cinnamon, Sichuan pepper and Fennel. It has a warm, spicy-sweet flavor and is primarily used in Chinese cuisine but also used in other Asian and Arabic cookery. *Depending on brand, some ingredients may be different and can include ginger root, nutmeg, turmeric, Amomum villosum, cardamomum, licorice, Mandarin orange peel or galangal.",

I served these as part of Easter dinner (the bunny didn't eat all of the carrots), and people ate larger portions than they ordinarily would eat of carrots.  Accordingly, I suggest planning on 1 1/2 - 2 carrots pp.  A nice change from my typical roasted vegetables with just salt and pepper.  Thank you.",
