My 11 year old daughter who has a taste for strange foods thought it was just right so I guess if you like fish that tastes like LEMON you might like it. I had 2 1/4 lb. of catfish filets and used the juice of 5 lemons. I did let the fish marinate a full 4 hours but didn't put lemon slices on top. If I make this again I will just squeeze 1 lemon over the fish and let it marinate for 1 hour. Using this method I would predict this would be a 4 or 5 star recipe. I didn't have lemon pepper or Creole seasoning so I used regular pepper Mrs. Dash garlic salt paprika parsley and a little red pepper. I did have to broil it for more like 30 minutes but my filets were pretty thick.",

Just way too seasoning for that amount of fish. The cooking method was great and the fish turned out well. Using about 1/3 of the amount of seasoning called for would greatly improve this recipe. Also I left out the lemon peel and lemon slices and between the lemon pepper and lemon juice this was MORE than lemony enough- I'd recommend leaving them out as I did.",
