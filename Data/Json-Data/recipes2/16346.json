We charred the bell peppers on the stovetop since it was raining outside and I cooked the sausages in the oven on 350 for 20 minutes. I used pinto instead of black beans and corn tortillas since that's what we had on hand. Otherwise followed the recipe and will definitely use this again (the charred bell peppers really added a unique smoky and wonderful flavor)! Yumm!!",
