Plus I used peach preserves in place of apricot and that must have added to the orangy color. It had the appearance of being very spicy but really this has a very sweet flavor.  Nothing spicy or sour at all. I cut the chicken into bite size pieced before baking it and reduced the cooking time. I added a little corn starch to the sauce when it came out of the oven to thicken it up and served over rice.",
