Used a full package (14oz) of smoked sausage. First started the sausage in a large skillet then added the onion and garlic. After the sausage started to brown added the spices then about 3/4C wine the tomato sauce and a little water. When that had heated added about 1.5C frozen green beans. Put on the lid and let simmer till green beans were cooked then added sour cream instead of yogurt 1t dried parsley and the parmesan stirring in the noodles when all had heated. Great dinner!",

It's a personal preference and probably didn't change the flavor all that much. When I make it again I will probably tweek it more just because I never make things the same twice. I'll probably add veggies to it or something. Also for the person who says the yogurt separated you probably had the heat too high.when working with things that use dairy you have to be careful with temperatures otherwise they can do weird things like separate or scorch.",
