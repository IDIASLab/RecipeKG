Suggestion would be to add 1/2 teaspoon of salt to get the tartness into the tart,  otherwise it's just too sweet. \nThe best one was made with the blend.  Tasted great and still low in sugar so your diabetic friends could have half a slice. \nThe full sugar one could have probably used a pinch of salt.",
