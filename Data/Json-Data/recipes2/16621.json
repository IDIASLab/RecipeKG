At the descried time the food was only very warm in the oven. The pasta was soft but extremely doughy and uncooked not unlike pasta put into a bowl of warm water for a length of time. The taste was very bland and \"cheap\" and my husband didn't like it either. I won't make this recipe again. The only thing I can think that could have helped would have been to start the cooking process with boiling water instead of cold except then it would have been difficult to mix completely prior to cooking.",

I did cook the noodles 1/2 way first before adding to recipe (I couldn't help it). Since I cooked the noodles a little I also cut the water down to 1/3 of jar. Cut the temp to 375 and away it went. The recipe was wonderful! Love the combination. Thank You so much for this little find. Yum.",
