When it was almost done, I added some thinly sliced zucchini and let cook for a few minutes. Added a little crumbled bacon. Beat 4 eggs with 1/4 cp milk, salt, and pepper. Poured over the rice/zucchini mix and topped with some queso. Baked at 350 for about 30minutes. Great flavor, although Next time I will skip the added salt. The queso was salty enough.\nI know I took quite A few liberties with the recipe, but will definitely make again and the basic concept is the same. Hubby and daughter liked as well!",

I used my box grater instead of the food processor just because I wanted easier clean-up. The cauliflower adds a mild flavor to the eggs and is so good for you. I added yellow pepper only because I needed to use it or lose it. At the end I garnished with fresh tomatoes again because I had them. This is a basic recipe that can easily be tweaked with green onion other fresh veggies additional spices and even a paleo friendly cheese.",
