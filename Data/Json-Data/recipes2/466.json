I liked the tartness of the granny smith, but thought it needed something more than a banana.  I will try it again, but will use yogurt instead of the milk and maybe add some blueberries or strawberries.  It is still a great way to get two of your fruits in for the day.",

After making the horrible discovery that we didn't have any ice cream for milkshakes, I hit Allrecipes for smoothies.  This was perfect because it looked nice and required no ice cream.  All ingredients needed were on hand.  After reading reviews, I changed a few things:\n\n           2 smaller apples for kids - \"Gala Gems\"\n           3 ice cubes instead of two\n           a little bit of vanilla yogurt\n           1% milk\nOther than that, I followed the instructions.  The result?  A wonderful smoothie!  It was gulped up by my mom, me and my brother.  Even my brother liked it and that means something!  I will definetely make it again!",
