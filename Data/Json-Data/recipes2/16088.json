My husband and I froze half of a 2L of Ginger Ale in ice cube trays and the other half we left in the bottle and froze. Then we cut the bottle away and floated that in the punch. It didn't look as pretty as ring might of but our round (fluted) cake pan is two parts and we figured the ginger ale would run out. After the frozen giger ale thawed it turned the punch slushy and made it even better. I will definatley make this again!!",
