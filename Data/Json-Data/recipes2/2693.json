I actually mixed this recipe with the Heathly warm Farro salas recipe on this site. That recipe includes spinach (actually kale) and crumbled feta. I followed this recipe mainly because of the mushrooms and the items in the other recipe are added last. It turned out wonderful! I am using this as the main course with a vegetable on the side. I wanted a healthier version so I left out the creme fraiche and the cheese in the one since I was using feta.",

I let the farro cook about 20 minutes longer than suggested, which I think was a fortunate accident.  There were no procini mushrooms at my grocery store, so I used a mix of dried wild mushrooms and a package of  white button mushrooms that I already had on hand.  Next time I would add a bay leaf while cooking, for some extra flavor.  I used Greek yogourt in the place of the creme fraiche (about 4 tbsp) and 3-4 tbsp of Parm (which was a bit much, as Parm is pretty salty).  It's similar to this recipe, which I keep in my rotation http://allrecipes.com/recipe/barley-mushroom-risotto/detail.aspx",
