I opted for a simplified version that tasted a little bit like less-sickly butterscotch and was strong enough to slightly inebriate something larger than a house elf. Great for Harry Potter-themed parties or Halloween. Served super-chilled in a frosted mug, it can magically warm up even the coldest wizards.",
