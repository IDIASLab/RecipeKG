My advice is to triple the recipe to use the entire block of cream cheese as the original recipe only makes about a (small) fist-sized amount of topping. I didn't feel like wasting a pastry bag so I used a ziploc bag (and did have some trouble \"piping\"). If I make this again I'd serve it in a bowl with allow guests to add as much or little as they like to their pretzel crisps. I left the olives out per personal preference. THANK YOU for the recipe!",
