        "description": "This is a recipe we have used for the past 5 years.  The beer really tenderizes the ham.  Using beer is probably a Wisconsin thing. We seem to find many uses for it.  But don't worry, the ham will not taste like beer when it is done other than maybe a small hint on the bottom portions. I don't like beer at all, so I was quite skeptical at first, but when I found out that the ham I had at my friend's house for Christmas the year before had beer used to make it, I tried it and have been hooked ever since.",

After combing this site for recipes, I chose this one. And am I ever glad I did! My friends whom I consulted on baking my ham kept telling me to use coke instead of beer. I'm glad I didn't listen! This was one of the most delicious hams I have ever tasted. My husband, who does not really care for ham, couldn't keep from eating it while he was slicing it. He said it was \"awesome\"! You absolutely can't beat how simple this recipe is. Tender, moist and juicy. I can't wait to do this again! Thanks for the great recipe!",

I brushed on the mixture every 15-20 minutes and removed the cover at the end to carmelize the glaze. The drippings even made a delicious gravy!

Made a sauce of: - Rest of pinapple juice - 1/4 c brown sugar - 1/8 c honey - 1/4 t cloves 1/8 t allspice 1/8 t nutmeg - Thickened with arrowroot to keep it clear When this was thick I added the broiled pinapple and the chunks from the baste.
