I've found that if you use 1 tbsp cornstarch and 1 tbsp self rising flour it doesn't give as much of the overpowering flour taste. Also USE A GOOD DELI PEPPER JACK if you get the prepackaged stuff off the cold shelf at the store it will NOT work. It doesn't melt well and will not give you the texture you want. I usually add a little extra cheese asadero or fresco. Gives it a little extra. I haven't perfected it yet but I'm still trying!",

Adding a can of tomatoes and chiles (Rotel) brought more flavor. This also makes it taste a little bit more like restaurant cheese sauce at the local Mexican restaurants. My husband and I were very impressed. This is probably as good as we are going to get with a Mexican cheese dip. For another idea adding a box of frozen spinach (squeeze the juice out) would make a great espinaca dip.",
