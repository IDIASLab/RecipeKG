The first time I used one bag of white chocolate chips but tripled the popcorn using 3 bags of lightly salted microwave popcorn and 6 crushed candy canes. The second time I doubled the recipe using two bags of lightly salted microwave popcorn four candy canes and six squares of almond bark. I cooked bark in microwave for 30 second intervals until melted stirring after each time and it took about 1 1/2 minutes to melt. I liked the consistency of the bark better. Put the two bags of popcorn in a very large bowl drizzled 1/3 of melted bark sprinkled 1/3 crushed candy canes on top then mixed with a large spatula. Repeated two additional times. Spread on parchment paper lined cookie sheets. This is a refreshing holiday snack. Lots of compliments.",
