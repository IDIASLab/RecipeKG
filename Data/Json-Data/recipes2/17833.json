Topped it off with a nice balsamic vinegarette. Husband said it had become one of his favorite salads because he loved all the different flavors.",

I think making your own croutons is totally worth the effort (what effort? 5-10 minutes is all it takes). They are great the salad is great. I do not brown nuts under the broiler after catching some pecans on fire using that method a few years back. Instead I toast them on the stovetop in a pan without oil over medium heat. That way I can watch them more carefully turn them easier etc.",
