Cook it a little longer to melt the brie completely and get a nice crust on the topping.  I would definately use 2 bunches of asparagus next time, or halve the amount of topping, quarter the amount of brie if you are using the recipe verbatim.  If you love brie, this is a fantastic way of enjoying it with asparagus!",
