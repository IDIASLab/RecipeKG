I just could not used creamed corn because of the unhealthy level of sugar and starch so used plain canned corn fully drained. I should have increased the milk to compensate for this since the end result was a bit too dry. I replaced onion with onion juice reduced the cheese by half cup (using a blend of four cheeses generally called \"Mexican\" and purchased shredded) used an entire 4 oz. can of green chilies with the juice and added two tsp. of Xylitol (natural alcohol sugar lower in calories made from birch). It was eaten up in a jiffy but I wish it had been a tad more moist. The defect was my own fault though. This bread would go nicely with salsa. It was a perfect companion to a spicey Mexican chicken/bean soup green salad and room temperature mango nectar. Thanks for a nice recipe!",

Both adjustments worked out fine BUT this bread was REALLY to MOIST for my liking. The flavor was WONDERFUL but definately cooked it longer (hoping it would dry out) than what the directions said. I did bake this to go with the White Chili with Ground Turkey (also on this site) and it was DELICIOUS! What I did was break up the this corn bread into the Chili so you couldn't see/feel how moist this was and between the two dishes and there flavors everyone ooooo'd & ahhhhhh'd at the table. I do think next time I'll try regular corn instead of creamed but I'll definately try this again with that alteration. If you bake this with the other receipe - cook this one first - by the time this is done so isn't the chili - perfect timing!",
