I did use half real eggs and half egg beaters. I added garlic salt paprika chili powder basil and rosemary to the egg mixture. Not much of each but just enough to add some extra flavors. I added raw chopped onions and peppers after it had cooked in the pan for about a minute. Then I added some turkey bacon bits mushrooms and then the cheese. Covered and cooked for a few minutes longer and then added the diced tomatoes with chilies. Was great!! Served with a dusting of cheddar and mozzarella cheeses.",

Also I didn't want to turn on my oven so I just carefully flipped it over once one side was done. And I added salt pepper and onion powder. He loved it!
