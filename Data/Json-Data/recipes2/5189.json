I did add 2 potatoes 1 T. dried parsley 1/2 tsp. ground thyme 2 garlic cloves 1/4 tsp. of black pepper and 1/2 tsp. of garlic salt to the crockpot along with the meat.

I left my sirloin roast whole rather than cutting it into cubes. I made a rub using fresh garlic fresh rosemary salt pepper onion powder and Herbs de Provence. I drizzled a bit of EVOO over the roast and massaged the herb mixture all around. Tossed in the bag of Birds Eye Recipe Ready veggies (nice time saver) and the beef broth. I cooked it slow and low (250 degrees for 3 hours). Removed the roast and sliced. Thickened the broth with a cornstarch slurry and served over white rice. The kids didn't even complain about dinner tonight which in my house means SUCCESS!",
