And I like my hard boiled eggs 'hard' - almost green.  The eggs peel easy and the minor discoloration in no way outweighs the convenience of this method.  Don't think I'll ever boil my eggs again!

When I first started peeling my own eggs, it was not going well, but as I got to the last ones, which were still in the cold water, they began to peel great. That being said, I don't think it's the cooking process that causes the peeling problem, but not leaving them in the cold water long enough. Hope this helps. I will try this recipe again.",

I made two different batches to test it. I used older eggs in one and newer ones in the other. A). no marks; B). EASY, just put the muffin tins away and that's it; C). The shells slipped off the egg for some of them before I could peel them! D). You can do this while doing other things.  Four  suggestions: use cupcake papers so eggs won't sit on metal or use silicon 'tins', use a gravy ladle to remove the eggs imediately from the pan to water with ice in it, and set oven to 325, not 350. I won't make 'boiled' eggs again because this is way easier and it's easy clean up.",

And let me tell you...these eggs were a breeze to peel. Only one egg had some difficulty and some of the membrane pulled off some egg but no big deal, I'm not making them for a cocktail party! I have a brand new oven so the first batch I baked for 27 minutes at 325 and they were hardboiled but the yolk had the slightest bit of moisture in them. I prefer FIRM hard boiled eggs. So I readjusted to 29 minutes at 350 and they came out perfect! Firm and the slightest bit bouncy. Since you have to transfer them to a bowl of ice cold water, just peel them under the water and it'll be easier. This is how I'll make my eggs from now on. Mess free, no huge pot of water to haul around the kitchen. :)",
