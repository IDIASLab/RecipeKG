Easy to do. Water chestnuts add good taste and texture. The first time I made this I didn't have red onions so I used white. The second time I used red onions and dish was vastly improved. Worth a try even for non-asparagus lovers. (It does look very nice!) Addendum: try adding a red pepper sliced lengthways for color. I think it really adds to the look and it's a good texture bridge between the water chestnuts and the asparagus. I added the red pepper in at the same time as the asparagus and water chestnuts.",
