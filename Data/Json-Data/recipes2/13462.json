The beloved husband returned and ate his pasta and drank his wine. He kissed his wife and said 'Amore! Your food is delicious as always. But I am a bit tired of pasta.' 'Don't you worry, my dear husband,' the wife replied, 'Tomorrow you will have something different.'",

I think it's that the sweet potatoes add such a  distinct, and slightly sweet flavor. The sage  butter sauce is perfect also. \nI made enough that I put half in the freezer for later.  I served that second act with a butter, sun dried tomato, garlic  sauce  - also added some frozen peas. It was  super!  \nToday I'm making some more of this gnocchi again. Thank you for this delicious recipe!",
