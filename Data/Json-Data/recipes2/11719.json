I used a cup of graham cracker crumbs mixed with only 1/4 cup of melted butter and 1 TBS of granulated sugar.  Sprayed a mini muffin tin with cooking spray and put about a TBS of crumbs into each well.  Baked those for about 5 minutes at 350.  Then took them out of the oven, added one rectangle piece of chocolate bar broken in half and a half of a regular sized marshmallow to each cup.  Turned the oven to broil, and broiled until the tops turned brown.  Allowed them to cool in the pan at least 10-15 minutes then removed.  Great hot, warm or even cold.",

Pack it into the muffin cups but you don't have to be fussy about it. We used mini chocolate chips which I'm sure melt differently then the bars but they were much easier to get into the cups. The only really hard part was waiting for the marshmallows to brown! You can eat them hot but they won't hold their shape until they're cool. The solution of course is to eat some hot with a plate to collect the yummy falling goodness; and save some for later (best of luck with that!). This version is campfire memories made with a perfect twist. You'll be happy you did.",

Maybe it is two packs inside one of the 14.4 oz boxes? Mine fell apart. This could have been written more clearly.. Also I think it works better to use one full size marshmallow cut in half. It adds an extra step but the three little marshmallows are not enough. They melted into a thin layer.",

I guess it meant 2 of the packages within the 14.4 ounce box.  We used a lot more butter than was called for in the recipe, but that may have been because we used the whole box instead of 2 of the packages.  Using paper liners is better, but you can make them without, if you grease the pans.  We used 5 mini marshmallows and 5 regular size chocolate chips per serving.",

It could be because I didn't mix the butter in well enough to the graham crackers though. I also broiled the marshmallows which only took about 30 seconds until the ones in the middle were in danger of burning! The taste was great though and I will make these again.",
