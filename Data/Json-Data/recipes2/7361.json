I followed the recipe to a \"T\" with the exception of frying up two strips of Trader Joe's applewood bacon and crumbling those up instead of using bacon bits. The chicken turned out extremely moist and tasty. However I didn't give this 5 stars only because the mesquite seasoning was just too strong of a smoky flavor for me and the family (in additions to the smoky Tabasco chipotle flavor). I realize the bacon added a smoky flavor too but it was the overly strong mesquite flavor that overpowered the other flavors. I'll definitely make this recipe again but change out the mesquite for a milder spice alternative. Probably will add a teaspoon of regular Tabasco to cheese mixture to give it some more heat. The possibilities of different ingredient combos are endless! Thanks for the recipe!!",
