In Singapore there's a little crunch from the Java chips. This recipe has the same little crunch. I'm not sure if it's from the frozen banana or cold coconut oil bits but it's good. Make sure you read the entire recipe first before making it. I just made sure I had all the ingredients first and was disappointed when I wanted to make it after a break from a hot afternoon in the garden when I found out that some of the coffee needs to be frozen. So I did that and was ready to make it in the evening. Then I found out that actually only a total 1 3/4 cup of coffee is needed not 3 cups so I had extra. Wasn't an issue since I just fed the extra to my plants but next time I'm just going to make 1 3/4 cup as needed just to save space.",
