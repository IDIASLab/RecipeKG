This cheeseball actually seems to get better as it stays out and in the days after (from the fridge of course). Perhaps it is the cheese getting to breathe. Feel free to add more of whatever you like in the recipe and there is room to experiment. It also tastes fine if you get the salad olives with pimentos.",
