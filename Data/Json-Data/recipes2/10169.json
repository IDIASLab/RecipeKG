So I opted to cut corners using frozen chicken patties and pre-prepared ingredients to make my life easier. Picked up the sub rolls and couldn't justify eating that many calories, so opted instead for sliced Italian bread and thin-sliced cheese. Turned out so surprisingly good, I thought I'd share. Enjoy!",

Kids liked it, hubby was fine with it...I'm not sure how often I would make it, but it was a wonderful spin on my \"easy dinner night\" which is just regular chicken patty sandwiches. I deep fried my patties to make them extra crispy and instead  of garlic butter I used plain butter and sprinkled garlic salt lightly on the bread. Served with a side of raw veggies and dip and that was a dinner that I was actually very satisfied with. Thank you for this idea/recipe, from my family to yours!",
