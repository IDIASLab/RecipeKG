I began cooking my frozen baby limas in water seasoned with Better than Bouillon and after about 7 minutes added the potatoes and onions. At the end, I drained the vegetables and saved all the broth. Sure was glad I did because in order for it to be soup, I ended up returning ALL the broth to the mixture. I was afraid to add the cumin but did. It gave it a very nice flavor. I did omit the coriander because I was out. One of the guests I served this to wanted the recipe, so that says much about how it turned out.",
