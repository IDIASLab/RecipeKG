I also added 2 sliced avacados. For the heat I used about 4 dashes of hot sauce tasting after each addition that way it was just right! Served it in Margarita glasses along with tortilla chips and saltines for those who wanted them. Next time I wont use the large shrimp because it was harder to get everything on the cracker... In my opinion the smaller salad shrimp would work better. I don't see how this would serve 8... It served 4 of us all right but we would have liked more!",
