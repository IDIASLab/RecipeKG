She wants me to make some more.  Mods:  used 1 cup rice, used 3/4 of a medium onion, cooked rice in chicken broth, used 1/2 can cream of chicken & 1/2 can cream of mushroom, used a whole bag (16 oz, I think) of frozen cut broccoli.  Great recipe!!  Thanks to the poster and to the reviewers.",

I really liked the bacon and we love onion but I did cut it back by half after reading the review's and I did add a little more rice but will not next time.I like more of a creamier taste than dry.

I used a whole pkg of 10-minute brown rice; most but not all pkg of frozen chopped broccoli and added 2 tbsp Creole Seasoning from this site 1 tbsp minced garlic and 1 tsp seasoned salt. This spiffed up what some called a bland dish. Instead of processed cheese I used a 10 oz can of Cheddar Cheese soup and 1/2 cup milk. I sprinkled 3 handfuls of white cheddar cheese crackers on top and baked. Kids ages 10 and 8 gobbled it up and hubby had seconds. We finished the 9x13 pan in two nights!

I used minute rice instead of long grain rice and I doubled it to 1 cup. I just cooked it in the microwave (add 1 cup water and 1 cup rice and heat for 5 min.) I only used half an onion and instead of the jar of processed cheese sauce I used a can of Campbell's cheddar cheese soup. (I think Velveeta would've been great too.)I also added a handful of shredded cheese. (Colby and Montery Jack I think.) IT was so tasty my husband said I \"hit a home run\". I roasted a chicken and had this casserole as a side dish. Because we then had leftovers I shredded the remaining chicken I had roasted and added it to the broccoli casserole leftovers added another handful of shredded cheese and mixed it all up. I put French Fried onions on top and baked it and it was like a whole new meal! I'll definately keep this recipe around.",
