When sauting the chicken I added some fresh sliced muchrooms. I added some garlic/onion powder when wisking in the flour and when the sauce was beginning to thicken and it came time to mix in the parmesan and chives I also added a small jar of diced pimentos for a little additional color. Served all over angel hair pasta. Very good and would make this tasty dish again. Thanks for sharing this Theresa!!",

I used only 2 large chicken breasts and it was the perfect amount to feed 4 very hungry adults. I can't imagine using 5 chicken breasts in this dish - there would be waaaay too much chicken IMHO. The only other change I made was to add a bit of chopped Italian parsley at the end for a hit of colour. In the end we did like it but found it to be a tad on the bland side (the mustard was the primary flavour). I might try this dish again but I would increase the amount of garlic and chives...and of course salt and pepper the chicken while cooking.",
