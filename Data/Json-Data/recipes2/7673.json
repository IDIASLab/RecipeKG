Considering no leavening ingredient I just assumed that there was a typo and this should have been self-rising cornmeal so that s what I used. This was a total disappointment because unfortunately what I ended up with was dense heavy and dry. I ate one piece and threw the rest away something I rarely do. Jillian Horton I know this is your grandmother s recipe and I m sorry for the bad review but in all honesty I simply cannot rate this recipe highly. There s not much room for cook s error here and this was just a failure for me.",
