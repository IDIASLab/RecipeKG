I had too many strawberries that couldn\u2019t be eaten up before spoiling so I decided to make this recipe. Other websites recipes called for pectin. I said, \u201cWhat is pectin?\u201d That gives you an idea of how much I don\u2019t know about making jam! Chef John\u2019s recipe only used apples and a lemon to make fresh pectin. Well I had those items on hand! I don\u2019t have canning jars around the house, so I used a few pickle jars that I had washed out and set aside last year for the hubby who often asks for something to store nails, paint, screws etc. I boiled the jars and lids to sterilize them before pouring my strawberry jam into them. I put the sealed jars of jam into the simmering water for 20 minutes. I removed the jars and let them cool on the counter. You could hear the jars seal themselves with a little suction sound as everything cooled down. I removed the jars and let them cool on the counter.

I poured the mixture into a measuring jug after it was done and it yeilded surprisingly an exact 3 cups of jam. I would definitely make it again and I can't wait to use this jam on more toast and in pastries! I followed the recipe exactly as Chef John described although I did not need to boil the apples and lemon for as long as he said. Maybe my stove is too hot at medium heat I wasn't using the correct pan or I was just not paying enough attention to adjust the heat better. Either way--at 15 minutes in it started to burn at the bottom and make everything look like applesauce which couldn't be strained through my mesh strainer. Instead of starting over--which I should have done but didn't have the apples or lemons for--I just put the weird applesauce back in the pot with another cup of water and heated it up for a few minutes. Regardless of my mess up I think I was still able to create pectin and the jam tastes right which is the most important part of it all!!",

It came out clear and I made enough to jar for future use.  I learned the best kind of apples to use along with some other tips.  I used more sugar, but still not the amount the recipe called for.  It still didn't gel like a jam would.  However, it is tasty. I have heated it up and put it over ice cream and strawberry cream cheese cobbler or spread it on a bagel.  So delicious.",
