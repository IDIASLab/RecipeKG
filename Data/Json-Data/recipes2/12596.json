Fresh turmeric is so much better than powdered, so I highly recommend you try this, even if you don't care for the powdered form.  To save time, I just strained the milk into my cup instead of getting my immersion blender out.  And since this only makes one cup, I suggest you double the recipe because you will love it! I ended up topping off my cup with extra almond milk. Delicious!",
