The paprika & the canned (fire-roasted) tomatoes must be the reason why I rate this \"BLT II Dip\" higher than the other BLT dip on this recipe site. This surprises me because I do prefer using fresh ingredients over canned but perhaps the flavor of the tomato was concentrated by using the fire-roasted type. (I partially pureed the tomatoes so that there weren't lots of large diced tomato chunks in the dip.) If you want a thicker dip maybe add a little non-fat cream cheese so it won't add more fat to an already VERY fat-laden dip. Do NOT add salt as the bacon already makes this nicely salted. I used slivered lettuce as more than a garnish: for added color taste nutrition & the \"L\" in BLT!",

After reading reviews from this recipe and the BLT dip alson on this site I became a little hesitant. But I used this recipe using 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes that I drained and pureed in my food processor; also added 1/2 packet of dry ranch dressing. I heated packaged bacon bits and mixed all together. Refrigerated over night. Here's where I think the secret lies: I spread the dip on a plate put shredded lettuce around the edge additional bacon bits in the center with 1 finely dice fresh tomato (drained on paper towels overnight). Served this with pita chips. The entire recipe was devoured in short order. Everyone (guys and gals alike) reported this to be delicious and I should put it on my \"bring to work\" list anytime! Thanks Terri for the great recipe!",
