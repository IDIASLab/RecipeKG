Didn't have any clam juice but used 4 cans chopped clams, juice and all.  Added a good bit of black pepper to stand up to the cream base and a touch more garlic salt for proper seasoning.  Threw it all in the crockpot 8 hours on low...PERFECT-O. Before serving, I dissolved about 5 tablespoons cornstarch in cold water and mixed in to thicken it up to an appropriate \"chowder\" consistency.  So delicious!!!  A winter-time favorite!",

I used a 28oz. can of whole baby clams 4 potatoes a 14 1/2 oz. can of evaporated milk 1 cup of water and I thickened it with a little flour. I used turkey bacon but the bacon flavor was strong so I will cut down on it and use just 9 slices instead of 12 next time. I felt the recipe could use more seasoning so I added garlic parsley thyme and chicken bouillon. I served it with hot dinner rolls and the family enjoyed it. Will make it again.",

I chop a handful of celery leaves and add a bit of dry marjoram to the potato celery and clam broth while they simmer together. I too prefer salt pork to bacon. I often make a \"base\" with this to freeze for later especially when clams are plentiful in the warm months. I make it up to the point where I would add the cream and freeze in quart sized containers. When I'm ready to use it I thaw the base in the refrigerator and heat slowly with the cream.
