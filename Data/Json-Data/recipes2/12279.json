I used sliced black olives instead which worked fine. It got me thinking that next time I make this I will use both green and black olives. This had a lot of flavor and texture going on which I like but the color of the watered down mayo wasn't very appealing to the eye. In my honest opinion I think it could be left out altogether and I will try it that way next time. Regardless, this is a good salad and one that would go over well at any picnic.",

There was tons of great texture but something in the mix was just off and left a bitter aftertaste.",
