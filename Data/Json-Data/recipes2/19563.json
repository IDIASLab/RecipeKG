I read, but didn't follow, to squeeze out excess liquid from carrots.  It sunk in the middle; but hey, my fault.  I'll eat your piece, if it's a problem for you.    Ohhh, I had to change the glaze.  I subbed orange marmalade, about 3T, with the 2T butter & 1T  bourbon; 1/2c sifted before measuring confec sugar  ~ half amounts ~ a dash o'salt.  With the sugar in the marmalade, I'd reduce the sugar next time; but it's yummyyyyy!   'Additional bourbon next time maybe.  The zest caramelizes a bit.  Who knew?!
