We've made this with shrimp instead of chicken, added apples, used spinach and zucchini... Have fun! Also, the seasoning quantities are on the \"light\" side. If you like your seasonings as we do, double them! It's the seasonings and coconut milk that make it. This can be served as a soup/stew, or with brown rice (our fave!), or quinoa.",
