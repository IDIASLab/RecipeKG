We added 1/2 tsp of salt the second time and liked them much better. I also just left the apple skin on the second time. Since you blend them it was fine and you get the added nutrient benefit.  These have definitely been added to our Saturday morning routine and satisfy you for many hours.",

These are dense and thick and delicious!  I tasted the batter and decided that indeed these could use a little salt as suggested by the first reviewer, so I added 1/2 teaspoon which seems to be right.  I made my granola using a recipe here that calls for some finely chopped nuts and dried fruits; these sweeteners were all the sugar the pancakes need.  One of my granddaughters thought these were very good, but the little one was suspicious of the texture---I suspect she will come around in time!  I will definitely make these again!  Thanks for this recipe, jboz53!",
