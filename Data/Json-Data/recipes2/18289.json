We didn't have butter, sprinkles, or white bread, so we subbed pita for the white bread, feta cheese for the butter, and chopped lamb for the sprinkles. It was so easy to make and my kids were also able to help, which I really appreciated. All in all it made for a great dinner, and I would definitely serve it to any guests.

We spread with a variety of things all spread thin; peanut butter honey butter and greap jelly. Then we used a scattering of mult-collored sprinkles and finished with a light dusting of clear sugar crystals. It made them sparkle and the kids gobbled them up. I was even able to coax most to eat some scrambled eggs and fruit just to get more \"glitter-bread\". Will for sure use this idea when the G.kids visit!",
