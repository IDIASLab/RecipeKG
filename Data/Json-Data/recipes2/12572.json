(Emphasis on the \"PAM\" because I have found that off brand doesn't work as well for me.)  \n\nI also didn't have any fresh thyme. So I just used a tsp or two of dried. The amount of salt, pepper, and parm was perfect. \n\nBaked 15 minutes on one side, flipped them over and baked them another 15 minutes. SO delicious.",

I think 20 minutes would have been perfect.  Other than that it was delicious, the peel slipped off easily, it was visually appealing, and a welcome departure from \"sweet  squash.\"  The Parmesan and thyme were additions I've not tried before on squash and I loved them both.  I will try this again with exactly the same preparation,  reducing the time in the oven and as soon as I can persuade Hubs to grin and bear it again (he does NOT like acorn squash - no fault of the squash or this recipe).",

I used Kraft Parmesan (the kind that is almost like powder), not the fancy grated kind, and it turned out perfectly. I only had to bake it for 23 minutes. I also rubbed the cheese/oil/spice mixture on the slices, as it didn't make a lot of \"sauce\" and it was easier to just rub it onto the squash than to \"toss\" it.  Next time I might make 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 times the sauce, as this just barely covered it.  But it was super yummy.",
