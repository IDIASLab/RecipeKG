Used olive oil instead of sesame added about a tsp of peanut butter to replace the flavor of the sesame oil and for extra protein. Added a dash of 5-spice powder too. Cooked on a cast iron skillet with only a bit of olive oil. I'd make it again especially to serve on a bed of lettuce and with steamed veggies on the side.",

I DESPISE canned tuna, but was looking for a recipe using things I had on hand and so whipped up this with things in my house...and I'm so glad I did!  I followed the recipe exactly except used regular onions instead of green onions.  When I make it again, I think I will try coating it with breadcrumbs instead of cornmeal, as I don't care for the gritty texture that cornmeal has.  Other than that, this recipe is awesome!!!",
