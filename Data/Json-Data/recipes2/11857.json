First, onion, celery and bell pepper cooked in the roux are a must. Then chopped garlic, then I added my meat, and immediately turned the burner off *before* the meat could brown - if anything it just got a bit \"gray.\" Then I seasoned with a heavy-handed blend of white, black and cayenne pepper. Meanwhile, I re-rolled pkg'ed crust into about 12 5\" circles (will DEF make my own crust next time, that was a pain) and put about 2T of filling into each pie, placing each on a greased pan after forming the pies and cutting tiny slits in the top for steam to escape.  I then baked for about 30 minutes at 350. But here's what sends this over the top - you should have quite a bit of meat mixture left over at this point - now you can go ahead and brown it and use that to make gravy, either from scratch or with a brown gravy mix - it is phenomenal over mashed potatoes and the pies.",

I did however feel that the \"crust\" was lacking. First there is no way I could get 15 meat pies from one store-bought pie crust recipe. The ones I bought (and I tried several) were much too crumbly to reshape into dough and reroll. Also very little meat would fit in there without breaking the dough as it was too crumbly as a pie crust. Basically I didn't get very far with this recipe but I think with a different type of dough it would work better. Maybe a homemade pie crust dough? I may try that next time though I'm a little hesitant after all the work this time that produced no edible results to speak of. That being said the recipe has the potential to be a 5 star for me if I can tweak the dough issue. Thanks for trying! It gives me hope that it can be done!",
