The cheese seemed to slip off the noodles when I served it so a lot of the cheese would fall back into the pan. This was much better than normal spaghetti and more interesting than normal pizza. It was very easy to prepare and didn't take much effort to cook either. I really recommend this for someone with children as I could see it being fun AND delicious for the kids. The only thing that takes away the fifth star for this is that the noodles tasted just a little dry after baking - hence why I might use more sauce next time.",
