My only suggestion is to add some salt to the meat mixture, as the amount of feta in the recipe isn't enough to salt the overall dish.  This tastes like a sausage burrito and I love that it was high protein, especially since I use low-carb tortillas.  This would be perfect to make a head of time for weekday breakfasts, with a short reheat in the microwave.",
