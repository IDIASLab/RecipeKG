I cut the 2 pastry sheets to make 4 strips.  When the sausage was spread onto the pastry and rolled over & sealed, I had 4 \"logs\".  When these were on the baking sheet I cut each \"log\" into 7 - 8 individual rolls and cut a small slit in the top of each. I wanted them for finger food.  I did add the bread which someone else suggested but I don't think it really helped with the greasiness, but it didn't detract either. Drain on paper towel while they're still hot. Don't skip the Dijon!",

I always add finely chopped onions to the sausagemeat along with breadcrums,parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. I roll out some pre-made puff pastry and pipe the mixture through a wide piping nozzle onto the sheet. After folding over the sheet to form a tube, I then cut it to the appropriate size. (At this point I usually cut one or two small slashs into the newly made rolls. This allows some of the fat/grease to escape from the roll.) If its for a lunch-time snack about 3-4 inchs is enough, or if its for a buffet style occasion then smaller ( about 1\" to 1 1/2\" is usually long enough).  Should any reader be visiting Scotland, I would recommend sausage rolls from Greggs to them. They are simply delicious. ",

Much less cooking time and the grease has already been rendered. A great Christmas potluck dish that disappears rapidly from the table!",
