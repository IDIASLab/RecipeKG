Butterball boneless breast of turkey roast to use for their Grilled Turkey Cuban Sandwiches (also on this site). I only used half of it for the sandwiches so I diced up the rest of the grilled breast and popped it in the freezer for another use. It worked PERFECT having that readily available for this recipe. I did scale this recipe down to 4 servings for my family and just kind of eyeballed all of the ingredients with the exception of the vinaigrette. For the vinaigrette I used 1/8 cup red wine vinegar to 3/8 cups extra virgin olive oil 2 cloves of crushed garlic & 1 tsp. oregano (as my hubby doesn't care for over-dressed pasta salads). I also added 4 leaves of fresh basil - just because! This one is going in the recipe box. Thanks Butterball!",
