It really pulled the clam flavor all the way through the sauce. I thought at first it was going to be really runny but as it turns out, it wasn't. The red pepper flakes gave it a nice heat at the end, but isn't totally neccessary at all, especially with minor children. The only thing I felt that needed more of...was the clams. my cans were 6.5oz cans not 10 oz so for the clams it's self I used 3 cans and only because it look like sauce with a few pieces. And I totally watched how much reserved clam juice I needed because the cans were a total of 13oz, not counting the 3rd can of reserved juice. But however, I'd make this again in a heartbeat. Very well paired with whole grain Linguine noodles. TY grainie.",

Instead of using butter and olive oil I just fried up about 5 slices of bacon (chopped into pieces before frying). Then added the onions to the bacon grease and bacon pieces then added fresh mushrooms roughly chopped then garlic etc.. Also I squeezed 1/2 a lemon to the clam juice and wine reduction. The Alfredo sauce is genius and the red pepper flakes add the perfect amount of spice. Phenomenal!!",
