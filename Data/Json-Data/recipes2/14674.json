I made it exactly as written except that I didn't think I had a skillet large enough so I cooked it in a large pot (the same one I usually boil pasta in). The minced garlic I used was the dried kind (as opposed to the kind that comes in a jar packed in oil or water) and the oil I used to saute the onion and garlic was extra virgin olive oil. Because the recipe didn't call for stirring the dish while cooking and because there was so little liquid I also found the pasta a little underdone and clumped together. So I made this a second time this time adding a half cup of water to the initial mixture. I stirred the dish for the first 20 minutes as the noodles softened up and then I added \"the rest of the cheese\" for the remainder of the time. It came out a bit better but still nothing spectacular. Maybe fewer noodles or cooking them before adding them to the dish would result in a better recipe. The pasta and the dryness are the main issues - the taste per se is pretty good otherwise.",

I added about 1/4 tsp pepper 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the meat mixture (and only used 1 15-oz can of diced tomatoes although after adding in the pasta I wished I'd used both it needed a little more \"sauce\"). I added the pasta and the 2nd cup of cheese at the end covered turned the heat off and let it melt together. Yummy!",
