Actually I made it for my family after a friend brought it to a party at my home.  It was such a big hit.  When she came she brought saltines to use to dip it with.  I figured she just didn't have other crackers so I got out the fancy type. Come to find out nothing is better than a plain ole saltine with this wonderful dip.  This will store in the refrigerator for 4 days. It is best made several hours in advance so the flavors meld.",
