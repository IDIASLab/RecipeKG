I used 10 \"stuffing mushrooms\" (large) and put 2 escargots in the largest ones.  Had to use a larger baking dish.  Increased the garlic to about 4 cloves (we LOVE garlic!) and the white wine and heavy cream to 1/2 cup each.  Also increased the tarragon to 1/2 teaspoon.  Removed the mushroom caps to the baking dish before adding the cream mixture to the escargots in the pan and sprinkled a little kosher salt over it.  Didn't measure the Parmesan, just sprinkled over the entire dish before baking.  Baked for 15 minutes and browned lightly under the broiler.  The wine was chardonnay.  This is heaven in a dish!  Don't know how it would have been as leftovers as we had none!!  You won't regret trying this one!",
