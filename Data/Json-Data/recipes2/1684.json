These are really creamy and very tasty.  The only issue I had was that I had to add in some liquid, otherwise they were too thick and more of a gluey consistency because of the cheese.   Apparently the AR Editors think this makes 12 servings. It does not. I'd say 6-8 servings tops, unless you're planning on only giving your guests a couple bites each.  The recipe submitter does state 8 servings in her personal version of this recipe though, which is more realistic.  I will definitely make this again.  It's the type of side dish that will leave your guests wondering what that secret ingredient is in your potatoes! Thank you harmonyb for sharing your recipe!",

I added the 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice as suggested and feel it was a great add. And while I appreciate working to get away from the super sweet versions of sweet potatoes I felt it needed just a \"little\" more sweet so I added about a TBSP of brown sugar. Just enough to get that salty/sweet effect! May try stevia next time. Great side!",
