Even though most of the spread is made up of fairly lean duck meat, by emulsifying it in a little butter, duck fat, and duck gelatin, you'll swear the final product has the fat content of the finest foie gras torchon.

I have found that Chef John's Crostini Dijonnaise are a perfect match for this spread. I try to follow Chef John's recipes to the letter but somehow manage to forget something or fail to have an ingredient. This is one recipe that will forgive an inexperienced chef. Since I have all the grace of a seal peeling potatoes I find the most challenging part of this recipe to be pulling the cooked meat from the bones. Last time I managed to get just under 24 ounces of meat from a six pound duck. This time I am shooting for 30 oz. If I can manage to find that much meat I'll serve half to the invaders and hide the other half for later consumption. This spread lasts a long time in the fridge (if it is well hidden).",
