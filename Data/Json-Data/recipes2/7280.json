One tip: make sure the cream cheese is soft or it will be tough to mix and even harder to spread on the tortillas. I plan on making these again as a snack light meal or appetizer.",

The best part is that they are to be made ahead of time thus making it easy to have on hand for either an after-school snack or for a social gathering. The tortillas I used initially were handmade tortillas from Trader Joe's and they seemed to be falling apart on me when I rolled them up. I then pulled from my freezer the regular Mission tortillas to make sure they would roll up. But the resting time in the fridge (2 hours) makes the whole wheat hold up just fine! I followed the recipe exactly and we enjoyed them a lot! Thank you so much Elizabeth for our afternoon snack! A cold glass of milk made these a perfect pick-me-up!",
