After melting the butter and condensed milk I took the pot off the heat and mixed in the rest of the ingredients to make sure they didn't get too soft. I also greased the dish I pressed the mixture into with margarine just to make sure the squares would come out clean when I cut them. If you are using smaller lemons perhaps it is better to use 2 instead of one - I used a large one and juiced it very well so the taste of lemon was excellent. To add to the sweetness (I have a sweet tooth)I drizzled the squares with some of the leftover condensed milk. It adds to the look of the dish as well. Overall a satisfying recipe and I will probably make it again if I need to use up a lemon!",
