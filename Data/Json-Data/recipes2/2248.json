                "reviewBody": "This \"Persian Rice\" recipe is how rice is prepared in Iran. I will add the following notes: (i) rinsing the starch out of the rice is of paramount importance and is usually done by swishing the rice around in a bowl of water and draining several times until the rinse water is clear (described as \"rinsed rice\" in this recipe, and shown as water running over rice in a sieve in the video); (ii) cumin in the potato crust (\"tahdig\") may be a regional variation but it is not common (at least not in Tehran) (sounds good though); (iii) sometimes the pot of steamed rice is just inverted over a plate with the potato crust left in place. If you want to do this, you need to have a few tricks up your sleeve to stop the potatoes and rice from sticking to the pot. For the potatoes, rinse the starch off the slices, dry them, and slide them around in the hot oil (so they are not sticking) before adding the rice on top of them. For the rice, use a wide spatula or egg lifter to mound the rice in the center of the pot (away from the sides) before steaming it. Before inverting the pot of steamed rice over a plate, put the bottom of the hot pot of rice (after steaming) in a sink of cold water to loosen the potato crust; (iv) always put a towel under the pot lid (as described in the recipe) or you will have soggy rice; (v) it is not necessary to add butter when steaming the rice (common but optional).   Kudos to Chef John for very clearly explaining this method of preparing rice (video)! Nice work!",

                "reviewBody": "Married to a Persian for many years, this recipe sounds about right. However, I suggest you boil the rice for only 6 minutes, tops.  I sometimes boil for only 5, depending on the rice I use. Cumin is not used in most Persian recipes, however, saffron is. For variety, you can make a pilaf after boiling the rice. Add baby Lima beans and dill weed for one. For another really yummy one, pre cook some lentils and steam them along with raisins and some dates and I like to add cinnamon, with the white rice.  Then you will have addas pollo, a Persian favorite.  There are many combinations which are wonderful. Rice with Shredded, saut\u00e9ed sweetened carrots combined with shredded, candied orange peel with a dash of rose water is divine.  So many!  There is a great Persian cookbook called New Food For Life. If you like this most simple  of recipes, I'd invest in it. Full of pictures too and detailed recipes.",

To make it easy, I put the rice in a fine-mesh colander and drop it into a pot of water. I gently swish it around for a bit, and repeat four more times with clean water. The rice will not come out very well if you don't rinse the starch off first. This recipe is foolproof for those who are uncertain how long to boil the rice before steaming it. It comes out perfectly every time. A kitchen towel or paper towels are absolutely necessary during steaming to prevent mush and to keep the rice beautiful and fluffy. I use lavash or pita for the tadig (crispy bottom layer), but one of these days I'm going to try the potatoes.",
