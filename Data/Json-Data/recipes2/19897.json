I used whole wheat wraps instead of pita and no ranch dressing or cheese (to cut out calories and fat). I was worried that cutting those things out would make it bland so I let the veggies marinade in red wine vinegar for a couple of minutes and I used garlic salt. I will definitely make these all the time and I'll also try it with the ranch and cheese sometime.",
