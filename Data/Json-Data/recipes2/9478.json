They have a chewy \"organic\" texture which we really like. The variations are endless. I've used: almond milk regular milk toasted nuts peanut butter raisins chopped apples bananas various berries coconut Chia flax even sunflower seeds plain & flavored yogurt (Greek is the best). Most of the time I don't use sweetener I find the fruit to be enough but if not Agave or a little brown sugar work well. Great easy healthy breakfast or snack.",
