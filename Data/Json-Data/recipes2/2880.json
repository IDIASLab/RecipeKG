I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome though!\n\nI altered the recipe a bit to better fit my taste buds.  When cooking the garlic I also threw in some red pepper flakes to spice it up.  I used a 15oz jar of alfredo sauce instead of 24oz and added a handful of grated parmesan.  I also used chicken broth instead of chicken stock just because I never have chicken stock in the house. \n\nAlso be sure to stir!!!!! The orzo will stick to the bottom on the skillet if you are not careful.",

I had a smaller jar of alfredo sauce and didn't have orzo so I used a 375-gram box of penne and added additional liquid. (I used about a half a cup more chicken broth and at least a half a cup of whole milk or maybe a cup... I was just eyeballing and guessing at how much liquid to add). I was keeping my fingers crossed that it wouldn't turn out to be a big gloppy mess... as I've never made a one-pot pasta dish like this with uncooked pasta and it kinda seemed too easy to turn out well. I also adjusted the seasoning to our personal taste by adding about a half teaspoon of salt a teaspoon or so of oregano and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I used 4 cloves of garlic since pasta can never have too much garlic and also a yellow pepper that I wanted to use up. Topped with grated parmesan and MMMMMMM... SO GOOD! Family of 4 loved it and there was enough left over for lunches the next day. Will definitely be adding this to the regular roster!!",
