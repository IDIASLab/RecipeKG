I didn't think there would be enough garlic flavor with rubbing the clove on the bread but too much garlic would ruin this. The rub gave it a perfect hint of garlic. Make sure to scorch the tomatoes using convection roast if you have that option. That is where the flavor comes from. These were good hot and at room temp. Dill is optional in my opinion.",
