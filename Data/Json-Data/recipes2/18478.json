I flavored my mashed potatoes with hot curry powder-- YUM, that added a wonderful taste (and smell!) To moisten the mashed potatoes, I made them with the appropriate amount of water and milk, then added about 1/2 C chicken broth. This counteracts the need for any creamed-soup (+ makes it dairy free and cuts the calories.)",

I did a few different things.. not major... but I cooked the onion and added garlic with the ground beef.  I added a little bit of seasoning...salt, pepper, a bit of this and that.  In my mashed potatoes I mixed half of the cheese in them and added sour cream.  I had almost 4 cups of mashed potatoes after the fact, so I threw it all on top of the complete meat mixture .... My husband had his working partner with him when he came home and asked him if he wanted \"Shepard's pie.\"  They finished almost half of the whole dinner.  My 2 year old loved it... but my 3 1/2 yr old...who has gotten soo picky... didn't even try it because he didn't like the way it looked.  Oh well...his loss... This seemed to be great comfort food from childhood for my husband.  Thank you.",

You may want to spice it up a bit. The other is the 'mashed potatoes is a bit vague; there are many possibilities for mashed potatoes. In my case I sued boiled three mid sized russet potatoes in a large saucepan with 1/2 tsp salt for 20 minutes (until tender) then blended with 4 tbsp half and half and 2 tbsp butter. I will definitely make this again.",
