It comes out much more like a muffin/bread product with this much flour (unless you use extremely fine and low gluten flour like cake flour). SO if you really want a true fairy cake and something a lot less dry you should reduce the flour to just over 1 cup (a heaped cupful). This will be more accurate and more moist! Still I give this recipe 3 stars because it's basically good just the proportions are slightly wrong.",

It seems like there needed to be more spice-ing up to these so I did double the cinnamon put in 1/4 tsp of ginger AND nutmeg and just a dash of allspice. I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Since I didn't have self-rising flour I added 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/4 tsp of salt to make up the difference. Information on the icing would have been nice or at least a link to the one used. And one last thing cardamom should NOT be optional! And there should be more than just a pinch.
