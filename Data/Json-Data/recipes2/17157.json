The prep time was minimal and the cooking time was brief. I cook at a student cooperative house full of 20 hungry college students so I scaled the recipe to 10 times its published size and used a large wok with excellent results. I found that the finished product was somewhat bland so I added a bit of extra ginger and a pinch of cayenne which gave it some needed extra kick. I also found it to be a bit dull and colorless so I added some grated carrots which gave it needed crunch and color. With my modifications my housemates gobbled it up and made me promise to make it again! I recommend serving with rice.",

We cooked it longer this time to crisp it up but it dried up the sauce in the process! A great simple recipe that I will be tailoring and using again! Thanks!",
