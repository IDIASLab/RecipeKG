I looked up this website and typed in sliced ham recipes and up popped this. The recipe sounded quick easy and to make it better the ham was fabulous. I added a bit of honey and I used brown mustard for the sauce. I m not particularly picky about what I eat but it looked nasty; lol! But you know what they say Looks bad but tastes great! Thanks!

I have not had the \"curd\" effect that others have mentioned. I have made this either in one of the oven proof plastic bags or the slow cooker and made the sauce to a boil prior to adding to the meat. The consistency is completely smooth and I found it gave good flavour to the ham and made it incredibly tender. Prior to serving I thicken the left over sauce and serve it as a dipping sauce. The last time I made it the sauce I added it to left over home-made macaroni and cheese and scalloped potatoes. It gave great flavour and a zest to both of these dishes. Thanks Kate!",
