I used a can of rotel and left out the small can of chilis.  I added cumin with the corn because most Mexican dishes have that cumin flavor.  I have made this soup several times and I finally figured out how to make it nice and thick like a cheese soup should be.  I let the vegetables simmer in broth more like 25 minutes, not 10.  Then I put 2 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch in a small cup of water until disolved.  Add that to the pot and cook another couple of minutes until it gets thick.  Then add the velveeta according to the recipe.  I've made this soup with yellow squash and butternut squash, both turned out great.  I top this soup with sourcream and crushed tortilla chips.",
