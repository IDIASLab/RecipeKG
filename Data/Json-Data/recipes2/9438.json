Just put almonds into a food processor until fine powder (works best with blanched almonds, but I used regular.) then add a bit of oil (i added MCT oil) a little at a time. \nI was also out of bananas,  just subbed a ripe avocado. we loved this switch, it added more healthy fat and less natural sugar. my husband keeps asking me to make these again. The children also liked these. sometimes (when I have bananas on hand) i throw those into a food processor and use the pureed banana as an 'icing' for the children. they get a kick out of frosting their muffins.  \nthanks for posting such a great healthy muffin!",

I love the taste, but I cut out 1/4 c. of the chocolate morsels. I also added 1/4 cup cooked quinoa. Thanks for this creative recipe!\n UPDATE; I use an electric mixer to beat the ingredients(prior to zucchini and morsels) together . I made another batch without quinoa and instead used 1/4 c. cooked teff. These came out moist and kids loved them!",
