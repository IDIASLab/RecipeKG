I also threw everything into the crockpot and let it sit for 4 hours on high. Sausage needed a little more time to cook but it was fabulous. I also used polish sausage rather than smoked sausage. Whole bag of spinach and a whole bag of frozen tortellini (14 ish oz). Definitely will make again.",

I followed the recipe but unfortunately I didn't have any tortellini but I still wanted to make this soup. I used 9 ounces of pasta instead and its still great. The flavours are really nice with the sausage and tomato and I didn't add any salt because the sausage was salty enough but give it a taste and chose if you want to add salt. I posted this so that anyone that wants to make this and doesn't have tortellini will know that the recipe works with that small change. Update-The pasta soaked up all the liquid in this soup so I would use less pasta.  It still tastes really good but it's more of a stew. Try 6 ounces of pasta instead.",
