I liked sauteeing the beans and the garlic powder was good although I think I will use fresh diced garlic next time. My husband didn't like the flavor from the cocktail onions I think since it's mostly vinegar! I thought it added a little punch without being overly powerful but next time I will try the onions themselves without the liquid. Overall we enjoyed this for a simple but different way to eat the same old (but yummy) side dish.",
