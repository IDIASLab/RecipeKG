Use whatever toppings you normally like on regular pizza, but the barbeque chicken is always a crowd pleaser! The dough never makes a perfect rectangle, but we have fun guessing what it looks like ('That looks like America!'). For the chicken, I use the grilled chicken pre-cooked at the store.",

I'm not sure why i never tried pizza on the BBQ before but Im sure glad i did and it will for sure become popular on our summer menu:) I used homemade dough rather than store bought and it worked out great! Also used the Blue Ribbon bbq sauce i received in my missing ingredient package..and WOW..LOVE it! Added some red onion just because and used yellow and red tomatoes. This is such a great way for people to customize their own pizzas. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",

I'm glad I made a second one because adding more ingredients really brought that pizza to a different level. The only downside was we ran out of propane while cooking the 2nd one so we finished it in the oven. The ingredients I added on the second one was; spread tomato paste at the bottom and top with BBQ sauce shredded chicken instead of chopped sliced red onion sliced red pepper garlic salt Italian seasoning black pepper and I substituted Mexicana mild along with Habanero shredded cheese instead of Colby-Monterey Jack cheese and sprinkle fresh chopped parsley. Beside the mild flavor from the original one it was interesting to try a new way of cooking pizza and using chicken and tomatoes which for us was a first.",

I followed all the ingredients and amounts but added a little red onion and red pepper to it. The pizza dough I had was not working for me no matter what I did it had holes and it fell apart so last minute I ran out and got a pre-made crust as all my fillings were ready and waiting! Here in Canada the only cheese I could find was a mild Mexicana blend with Colby Jack and Cheddar cheese. Besides the red onion and red pepper I don't think I'd add anything else it's perfect.
