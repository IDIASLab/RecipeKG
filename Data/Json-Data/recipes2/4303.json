I am anxious to make it with breakfast sausage next time.  Thank you.",

I thought it was decent.... felt like the potatoes were a little soft and it could've been cooked longer, perhaps.  But so many people asked for the recipe and it was the only dish that was completely gone at the end of the event, so that's gotta speak for something!  I used beef chorizo, since there was a pork allergy in the group.  I can't imagine using Italian sausage for this and don't know why it's even listed as an alternate... that would completely change the flavor!  The chorizo is what makes it, in my opinion!  I'd make it again.",
