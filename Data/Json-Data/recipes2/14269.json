This drink is very good if you want something warm and comforting at night but can't drink tea (or coffee) with caffeine too close to bedtime. Or if you're a little hungry since milk is filling. The vanilla is a good addition but not necessary in my opinion. However this drink is very very sweet. I will definitely reduce the amount of honey next time. I was a little misled by the \"Milky Tea\" name at first but that's all right.",
