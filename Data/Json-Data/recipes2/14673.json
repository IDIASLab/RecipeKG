I didn't like the crust but, of course, that is to be blamed on the brand of crust I chose (a generic store brand - you live and you learn) and not the recipe itself.  While eating it, I thought that instead of brushing the stomboli with butter, perhaps garlic butter might have given the crust more flavor.  Regardless, this is a great recipe.  The possibilities are endless and limited only by your imagination - adding whatever fillings you like.  It was a top notch recipe for a family favorite! Enjoy!",

Instead of making one giant stromboli, I split the pizza dough into 4 pieces and made smaller versions.  I used 6 oz of fresh mushrooms but the same proportions of everything else and found that I had at least a cup of leftover filling that I used w/ pasta the next day.  Also I found that 1/4 c butter is a LOT.  I used 2 tbs and that was plenty to saturate & glaze the strombolis.  THey were just as yummy reheated in the oven the next day!",
