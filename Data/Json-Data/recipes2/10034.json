I also used a bit of green powder(smoothie lacks protein & I didn't think regular protein powder would taste well) I wouldn't recommend it for people who are new to it--it's definitely an acquired taste. Also I wouldn't add the vanilla extract next time--it wasn't a bad addition I just felt it didn't need it. This smoothie is great talk about getting at least 2 servings of veggies & 2 servings of fruit(if you add the banana). I'll definitely make this again.",

I put zucchini in my garden for the first time this year because I wanted zucchini bread but I thought that was the only way I would eat zucchini because mom used to serve to to us kids plain (and we hated it). I have gotten so much zucchini from two plants I've been looking for good ways to use it besides in the bread. These smoothies are a good way...My kids can't get enough of them! I've put frozen peach and frozen pineapple into the mix and I've used regular sugar and honey because nobody in my house is really dieting. I also took out the seeds from the zucchini and peeled it thoroughly. 4 stars for taste and 5 stars for using the oft-unloved zucchini in a way that is delicious and nutritious.",

Well anyways this recipe was VERY VERY DELICIOUS! it was a little thin but i just added a coup;e more ice cubes and it was fine. next time i will add 1/2 a banana like some reviews said and omit the sweetener. i think i may have added a little more zucchini than called for but it still tasted really delish!...... word of advice; when drank awhile after it is made it doesn't taste quite as good since the flavors tend to separate....but it hardly last that long so no worries!EDIT!!! tried without sweetener and still very very good. Also tried with 1/2 frozen banana and freezed the zucchini my favorite way was with freezing the ingredients since it came out much more refreshing and more smoothie like in consistency! overall it was wonderful and i recommend for every1 to try.",
