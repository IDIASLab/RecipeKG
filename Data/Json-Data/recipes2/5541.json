Use Kosher salt for meat and recipes that call specifically for it. Because the larger flakes hold onto moisture, Kosher salt essentially holds the moisture inside of the meat. It keeps pork chops tender, steaks juicy, and chicken breast moist.  Also a tablespoon of Kosher salt is approximately HALF the weight of a tablespoon of table salt.",

I love the concept and tried this.  The recommendation of dry brining for 18 to 24 hours is off, I think.  And the recipe doesn't state whether to brush off the excess salt, or to rinse them before grilling. Chef should clarify this.   My chops came out far too salty using the recipe as is. Still, I like the technique so will try again, brining for at least half the time and removing any excess salt before grilling",

I followed the recipe exactly, using kosher salt.  I applied the mixture, left them uncovered on a rack over a pan lined with paper towels. They were in the fridge for about 20 hours.  The recipe did not state whether or not I was supposed to rinse the meat, and pat dry before applying the oil, so I didn't. Wiping it off would've been difficult, as they became just a little sticky.   Cooked to proper temperature, and left to rest, these ribs were very tender and juicy. That said, yes, they were too salty, and I really like salt.  I did appreciate the easy recipe and the texture of the end result, so I will, happily, try this again.  Next time, I will rinse and pat dry, and/or not leave them quite so long.  Btw, slicing into these ribs, even two days later, the juice just squeezes out!",

I had mixed and applied the seasonings separately for each chop and mine had more cayenne pepper and I thought it was too (spicy) hot; the other was fine. I\u2019ll omit it next time.
