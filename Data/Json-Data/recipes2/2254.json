For those of you that have a \"Salad \"Spinner....you can shave 3-4 hours off the prep time waiting for fruit to drain. I made a half recipe, so I was able to put all the fruit into my salad spinner and PRESTO!! Your fruit is ready to prepare right away! \nI loved the suggestion of the orange Jello powder, I mixed it separately with the sour cream before adding to the fruit mixture.  I took it a step further by adding a handful of maraschino cherries cut in half,  toasted coconut and toasted almonds. If I had macadamia nuts, I would of used that instead of almonds. But the salad was fantastic! You could add bananas if you knew there would be no leftovers, for cut bananas can turn brown if not consumed in a day. I made this salad today for a test run to see if  it would be good enough for my Hawaiian Luau Party next month. This salad will be a crowd-pleaser. You won't be disappointed,  especially  if you add the other ingredients I suggested.",
