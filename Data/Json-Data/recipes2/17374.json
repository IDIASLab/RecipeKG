The best way to eat this is making sure you have a piece of shrimp with a piece of pepper with a piece of basil on you fork.  Not bad, but we ALWAYS have leftovers and this doesn't work for that",

Wish I'd had a red pepper as the photos would have been more colorful but since I cut the recipe in half I used one yellow pepper with some green on it. We liked this and will make it again during the summer months when most of the vegetable and herb ingredients are fresh from our garden. Note: I used the raw shells from the shrimp to flavor the pasta water - remove before adding the pasta. Kicks up the flavor!",
