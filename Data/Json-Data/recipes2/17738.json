As the other reviewers have mentioned, I do think the cookies benefit from a little vanilla extract, brown sugar and salt, but the cardamom is key. If you're using the packaged variety, you'll probably want to triple the amount, but using the actual cardamom pods makes a huge difference and really gives these cookies their flavor. I'm the first to admit you can't buy the pods everywhere (and if you do, they are on the pricey side), but if you have them, use them! (To extract cardamom: lightly brown pods in a pan over high heat - but don't overdo them! - remove cardamom seed from shells and crush using a mortar and pestle. For the leftover pods, I occasionally add them to my tea like the Lebanese do.) Also, this is one of few cookie recipes that turns out better using the old fashioned bowl & spatula method rather than the mixer. Finally, make sure your butter is softened (place in microwave for 25 seconds) to ensure a good dough. ",

So on my second batch I added 2 tbsp of brown sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla extract (as well as using 1 heaping tsp of cardamom again). That made cookies that were slightly sweeter and still had a good cardamom taste.\n\nIn my oven it only took 17 minutes; the first time I checked them at 20 minutes and they were already overbrowned. So I'd suggest keeping a close eye on the first batch to determine how many minutes they need in your oven, since it's very important not to overbake these cookies. The flavor is delicate enough that if you overcook them, the \"overbrowned\" taste will overwhelm the flavor.\n\nSince I'm lazy, I just made them as drop cookies. They cooked just fine as drop cookies.",

I have had ghroubah in Tunisia and found them to be good but dry (I think they make theirs with semolina flour so they are a bit more gritty) and these were far better! Thanks to kellimelli for the suggestion of more cardomom...definitely a must do! I added a HEAPING teaspoon of cardomom. I used my cookie press to make them so pretty and omitted the almonds. So few ingredients make them perfect..but u will want to double the recipe. These are intended for a care package to my inlaws in Tunisia...I am sure they will impress coming from their American daughter-in-law! Make sure your butter is at room temp....and keep beating and it will eventually come together to form a dough ball.",
