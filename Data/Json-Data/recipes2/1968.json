I thought this needed more salt, but otherwise I liked the overall flavor. I used chicken tenders instead of cutting up chicken breasts into thin strips. Even with the bigger tenders, 12 to 14 minutes is more than enough time. 15 to 20 minutes would overcook thin 1\" strips. To get a nice crisp, I sprayed the tenders with my olive oil mister. If you don\u2019t use oil or butter (as suggested) they won\u2019t get crispy.  A quick weeknight meal that the whole family will love!",
