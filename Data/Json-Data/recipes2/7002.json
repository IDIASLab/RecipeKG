These had great flavor, and were definitely worth the extra step of cooking the zucchini, onions and garlic first. I did omit the thyme, as we do not care for it. My little girls loved these, and even my boy who usually does not care for zucchini patties ate them up! I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",

Grocer was out of all but 3 small zucchini So I added a squash (cooked) for the other cup and some grated carrots and celery and onion for the other cup. The flavor was good but didn't stick together well unless I formed them small and cooked them in the 2 \" oil a long time before turning over. The taste was very good. Make sure you use exactly the amount of zucchini they call for in the recipe cause that is what it needs. My squash (green acorn squash) was obviously too soft to make a good solid patty. ANYWAY added parmesan cheese was amazingly good on top of the cooked Parmesean Zucchini Pattys!!",

I added 1/2 C. flour to the remaining batter & they stayed together & tasted pretty good. Will go back to my old recipe (which used flour for a thickener) and would not make this recipe again.",
