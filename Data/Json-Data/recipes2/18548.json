I recommend going ahead and cooking the carrots-- I've had this before where the carrots are fresh and there's something nice about having them slightly softer (only slightly-- 2 minutes was perfect).

Instead of Splenda I used 2 tsp of agave nectar (a natural sweetener). After tasting it I added a touch more olive oil cider vinegar cinnamon and ginger. And I used 4 dashes of cayenne--just enough to give it some heat but not enough to burn your mouth. I bet this would be good topped with slivered almonds.",

I used honey instead of splenda (as one reviewer suggested) and I omitted raisins (Just can't do it thanks to \"Better Off Dead\"...if you haven't seen it rent it great movie) but I added slivered almonds instead. I didn't have any fresh ginger on hand so I substituted w/ dried ground ginger and it tasted just fine...I am sure would have been even better if I used fresh. I also made sure to refrigerate the dish for at least 3 hours. It got better the next day. Great recipe and can be very versatile. Will make again and again",
