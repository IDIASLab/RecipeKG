These were too easy & fun to make! I had only 1/2 lb. sausage & was cooking for two so I halved the recipe. Using less cream cheese is TOTALLY OK! I used half a pkg. of cream cheese and threw in a couple wedges of Wee Brie for extra creaminess. I didnt even freaking let the mix sit for an hour before rolling them into balls and baking them; my b/f RAVED and said they were soo-oo delicious. I served them alongside fresh sauteed grean beans and they made a great meal! This is SUCH a keeper especially for a German sauerkraut loving girl like me!",
