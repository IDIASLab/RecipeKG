Or most grocery stores in their deli department where the hummus is kept. The only difference in my making this dish is that I didn't have the Keri Gold Irish Cheddar but used Pepper Jack. Came out just as delish and a bit spicier. This will be an appetizer dish for my Thanksgiving and Christmas Dinner and any other time I want to make a big impression. There is absolutely no way you can mess this recipe -- it's that easy. Again THANK YOU LESLIE.",
