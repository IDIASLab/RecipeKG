While we still use the charcoal grill, the extra space allotted to us on the gas grill has made us really branch out with different sides.

I did replace some of the rosemary with oregano but only due to personal preference. Rosemary goes a long way with my husband and I. The only thing that didn't work perfectly for me with this was the boiling time. My wedges were thick but 8 minutes was too long. They got a little too soft and some started breaking away from the skin. You have to remember that they are going to continue to cook even after they are drained so I recommend pulling them off at 6 minutes. With that being said this was an excellent recipe and one I will make often during summertime grilling!",
