This year I decided to bring dinner for Saturday night. We used this rub on an 8 lb. tenderloin (had to make 4 times the recipe) and it was a huge HIT!!! The aroma from the rub/roast filled the house with a wonderful smell and the taste matched the smell. Even my 9 year old loved it. Thanks Eileen for the great recipe!",

Left out the orange peel and substituted some orange juice in its place; didn't have six hours to marinade but it didn't matter. This was pretty darn tasty; I put seasoning salt and fresh ground pepper on the tenderloin as well but still added those two seasonings to the mix as well. Took longer to cook. Served with a tomato/basil/fresh mozzerella salad and the pan fried asparagus recipe from this site. Great meal. Drank Zinfandel which complemented the meal tremendously.",
