Made it as written, served over seared skirt steak, and didn't need to adjust anything (though I did--just a bit of lemon juice, as I love the flavor, but definitely good, and authentic, without it). One thing that would improve the recipe, though,  is to specify the exact amount of parsley. Perhaps by specifying how many cups of stripped parsley leaves, as you did with the cilantro and oregano? Saying \"1 bunch\" doesn't really work for someone who has never tasted Chimichurri sauce before, i.e. how do they know how much parsley flavor there should be, versus the other ingredients? And, of course, parsley comes in differing size bundles...",

Since I didn't have white wine vinegar, I used an equal measure of rice vinegar and a little bit of lemon juice. I also used powdered garlic and dried oregano instead of fresh (definitely recommend fresh garlic if you have it in the house, but powdered worked fine as well.) This chimichurri was beautiful on top of grilled chicken breast, and tasted amazing!! (As for sides, we used roasted asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes with mini marshmallows, just for fun!)
