Reduce heat to low and continue simmering until the berries have burst and the sauce has reduced slightly, 10 to 20 minutes. Let the meat rest 10 minutes before slicing; serve with the blackberry sauce.\n"

The pork was tender and moist and the blackberry reduction was perfect with the pork.  I would reduce the amount of sage when I make again.  I found it a bit overpowering.  I also strained the reduction sauce before serving.  Our blackberries are fairly seedy.\nServed with a selection of zucchini and yellow squash, green beans, carrots and sliced baby potatoes roasted in the oven with a bit of olive oil and pepper and it produced a company quality meal.",
