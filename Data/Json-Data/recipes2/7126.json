Since we were doing that, I added more peppers than the recipe called for as well as some mushrooms.  I've never toasted quinoa like this before and I really think it helped bring out the nutty flavor of it - I will definitely use this technique for quinoa in the future!  I liken this dish to a stir fry in my cooking library because it's great to use up leftover veggies you might have in the fridge.  I will definitely be trying it with broccoli and other vegetables that I often have.  This was a great weeknight meal and the leftovers (there weren't many) are going to be great for lunch.  I'd also like to put this filling in a tortilla, freeze, and give to my landscaper husband for a tasty lunch.  You can also add shrimp or chicken if you'd like.  Big fan of this recipe - will make again for sure!",

I did not have parsley but used cilantro and think it did a better job than what the parsley could have done. Paired with baked lemon tilpa and made it into a bowl.
