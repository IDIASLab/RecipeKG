If you have more of one just use it to sop up the delicious juices on your plate. Do use raspberry vinegar it is so fruity and tart that it gives a boost to your tastebuds. Serve with a cool glass of white wine and let the summer heat slide right by you. Thank you for the recipe.",

Basil goes really well with strawberries and balsamic vinegar. And I drizzled the dish with 25-year aged balsamic vinegar which has a sweetness thickness and fruitiness all by itself. This is definitely on my appetizer list for the future!",

Since I had searched for \"no cook\" recipes I didn't expect this.  Thankfully, I had purchased a small bottle of balsamic glaze (thickened) and stirred the raspberry balsamic and glaze together.  Perfect.\n\nThis presents well, my guests enjoyed it, it's quick to prepare (if you skip the balsamic reduction), and is a unique and tasty appetizer to add to my rather ho-hum collection of appetizers. \n\nThank you!",
