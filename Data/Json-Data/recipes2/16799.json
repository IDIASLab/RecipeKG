I think next time I will double the garlic. Oh and I definitely didn't use that much cheese! Maybe 1.5 cups of shredded cheese.",

Made some modifications: added about half of red bell pepper to the garlic/artichoke saute and this really helped on issue of excess liquid that many reviews commented on. Also added fresh basil during about the last 3 minutes of cooking -- really adds to flavor. Used Boboli pizza crust and sauce -- good choice. Boboli crust instructions said to only cook for 10 minutes whereas the recipe said 20. Took out after 10 but flavors weren't quite there yet. Put back in for about another 10 and it was much better and crust held up fine to the extra 10 minutes of cooking. Will make again.",

There is a conversion chart somewhere that shows how to mix tomatoe paste and make it into sauce juice and catsup. So I never spend my money on premade sauces. Whenever I use a sauce for pizza I always mix in some oregano and some dried red pepper flakes. It gives the taste of NYC to your pizza. I also like to add salt but only to veggie only pizzas and have even put olive oil on others under the cheese not too much to give it that nutty flavor.",

We use our own pizza crust recipe so we altered it a little according to how we always cook pizza. I put the sauce tomatoes and artichokes first. We cook it for about 15 minutes then add the cheese and cook for about 10 more minutes. This keeps the cheese from burning. Next time I wouldn't bother with cooking the artichoke liquid with the garlic. I used pre-chopped garlic and would just add both of them to the pizza. I didn't see much value in cooking the garlic in the artichoke liquid.",

If I don't have those handy I roast a whole garlic - cut the tops off and put a bit of olive oil over it and roast for about 40 minutes. Perfect for a lot of different dishes. On this recipe I use the Boboli ready-made crust and it's perfect. The whole thing from start to finish takes about 15-20 minutes. I also add some fresh (dried would work as well) basil.

But I'm one of those who don't see the point of the simmering liquid part. It makes it more time consuming dirties a pot and is actually quite strange taste-wise. It gave the pizza a wierd oily preservetive-y taste that I really disliked. Luckily I didn't have the patience to wait until the liquid thickened and poured most of it down the drain before adding. I think that rescued the meal. Next time I'll save the time and effort and put everything straight on the pizza. Otherwise good stuff.",
