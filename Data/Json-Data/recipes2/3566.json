I used original flavor since I didn't know if the suggested brand was spicy or not. I also pounded the chicken breasts flat so they would cook evenly and we would not have a really fat piece of chicken on the sandwich. When sauteing the veggies put the bell peppers in first and let them cook a little bit then add the onions and when they are about done add the mushrooms. I didn't think about doing this when I made it so I ended up with over cooked mushrooms perfect onions and crunchy bell peppers. I used an onion bun. Definitely worth trying.",

Then I started spreading BBQ sauce on it every time I flipped it - about every 5-6 minutes. I did kinda eye the seasonings instead of measuring them out and used a \"bold\" BBQ sauce. It took about 18 minutes on medium heat in my skillet to cook through using medium-sized chicken breasts. I toasted the buns in the oven for a few minutes then put on the chicken and cheese (used provolone because that was all I had) and put back in the oven for about 2 minutes until the cheese melted. Then I topped with the onions and mushrooms (didn't use bell peppers because we don't like them and I didn't have them). Hubby and I both really enjoyed this sandwich. We served it with homemade fries and cut up apples.",

I also made enough chicken breasts so I could use \"Everything\" Hogie Rolls. I put the Italian seasoning and the grilling seasonings in a paper bag added the breasts and shook them. Boy were they coated. I used Mesquite BBQ sauce our favorite and grillled them inside on the George Forman. When I sauted the veggies I used olive oil. And I did cook the veggies one at a time as suggested so they would be done at the same time. I forgot to get cheese so I used a smoky swiss and cheddar. We will probably have these again but I will probably rethink the seasonings. Maybe leave out the Italian seasoning and along with the grilling seasoning add some Mesquite Grilling seasoning and onion and garlic powder. Oh I cooked the chicken at a higher heat so they would cook faster. I didn't want them to dry out and they didn't.",

I'd been thinking of leaving out the Italian seasoning because I sensed it might throw off the sweet smokey tangy flavor of the Neely's BBQ Spice Rub & the chipotle barbecue sauce I used; I also didn't want the Italian herbs to burn on the grilled chicken. Reading another reviewer's statement about the Italian herbs made me decide to go with my instinct. I had to addat least another tsp. of butter to saute the vegs which I added at different stages per other reviewers. We both liked this but probably will make only a few more times as there are so many other chicken dishes I prefer. After tasting this as recipe was intended we found we liked it better with crunchy moist lettuce more Swiss cheese & 1 Tblsp. of mayonnaise mixed with 1-1/2 tsp. of the same chipotle BBQ sauce spread on the whole wheat Kaiser roll. Out of curiosity & having 3 types of mushrooms available I sauteed in separate pans mostly the sliced common white button mushrooms (this was best) some chopped portabello (this was very good) & some hedgehog mushrooms (I now know I don't like this type).",

As I was going to turn on the grill found we were out of proprane--so I used the broiler which worked fine except for the fact that it's a pain to clean off. I used frozen pepper mix (love this stuff) fresh onion and canned mushrooms. I really liked this sandwich found it really good. Both my husband and I think a hearty roll with a back on it would work best since our veggies kept falling off the sandwich.
