It is also very adaptable and forgiving :)  I also like that it makes a huge amount of food, for less $ than some of the other chili recipes on here.  I've added some zucchinni that was about to turn, played w/the beans and added only red pepper, or only green pepper.  The only thing I like to keep constant is the spices (well actually, I estimate according to the recipe), and play w/the vegetables. \n\nAnother thing I've changed is to rinse the beans and add a little more water.  Otherwise, you get caught up with ridiculous gas pains.   \n\nGreat great recipe, thanks so much!!",

Well, this is like a fresher, healthier version of that chili.  I just love it!  I omitted the mushrooms, added one jalepeno and had to use roasted red peppers for the red ones because I was out of fresh.  I made this in the crockpot and it worked out perfectly.  I added about 1/2 cup of water but around midday, it was too thin so I added a 6 oz. can of no-salt tomato paste.  I love, love, love this recipe!  It makes A LOT too- we'll be enjoying this for a few days- yay!  I might try freezing some.  I served this with Fry Bread I for dinner.  Oh, my one-year old loved this too.  He just ate and ate and ate.  Good for the whole family!",

I added a small can of diced jalepeno's to give it an extra kick and it made the flavor perfect! I used all the liquid from the beans but I drained the liquid from the corn. I cooked the chili until the consistency was what I wanted. I read some say they thought it was too runny. Not the case if you cook it longer. This chili looks so pretty too with all the different colors from the beans corn and jalepeno. Great recipe! I will make it again...thank you!",
