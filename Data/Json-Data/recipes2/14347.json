After reading the previous reviews I made the following changes to the recipe in order to give it a more 'dinner-time' flair: (1) used 1 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of 2 cups; (2) Added 1/4 tsp ground pepper; (3) 1/4 cup milk for additional creaminess; (5) crumbled 4 slices of cooked bacon into the recipe; (6) Sprinkled the top with fried onions and light amount of shredded cheese. The previous reviewers are right about an entire packet of onion soup mix giving this dish a little too much saltiness or onion flavor. But all in all a good recipe base from which to build to your liking.",

I made a few tweaks to this and it came out delicious. I used only 1 cup of sour cream. I don't think using 2 is really necessary as you are going for a casserole and not spinach dip. Also per another reviewer's suggestions I added about half a cup of crumbled bacon to it and used vegetable soup mix instead of onion. Finally to make this more \"casserole\"y I added 2 cups of penne pasta to the mix. Combined and put in casserole pan and then topped with a 4-cheese blend of Colby Mozzarella Monterey Jack and Cheddar. It came out delicious. I love spinach dishes so I will definitely make this again. I highly recommend this dish to anyone with kids who has to think of ways to get them to eat their greens.",

We are both always looking for different ways to eat our greens so this dish has become popular in our household.

This dish is a great starting point for adding leftovers or getting creative. Have fun with it!!!!",
