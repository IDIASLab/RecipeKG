I spray my pan with pan and don't put the sauce in the bottom.  I place the sauce on top and the last few minutes sprinkle some shredded cheese on top.  My hubby requests at least weekly.

The queso was off-putting there was too much of it and the enchilada filling was excessively creamy. Every bite was mushy and artificial tasting (it goes without saying that pre-processed ingredients are convenient but tasteless). Maybe these will float your boat but it certainly didn't ours.
