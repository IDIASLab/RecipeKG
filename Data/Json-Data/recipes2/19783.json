First of all since the vegetables (including the potatoes) were \"minced\" it really lacked the chunky vegetables usually associated with a chowder. Secondly there was very little flavor even though I added additional clam juice cayenne pepper and salt & pepper. The broth also seemed to seperate making a very odd consistency. My husband who found & was looking forward to the recipe ordered a pizza.",

I wanted to make a medley of seafood items in a dish very much like yours. I love your ingredients and from that I made a few changes and here\u2019s what I did.Instead of using water I  exchanged that for chicken broth and whole milk instead of half-and-half.I upped the butter to one cup.  In my saut\u00e9 I chopped celery, green onions and white onions.  I added. Oyster sauce, and plenty of obey seasoning. I omitted the tomatoes.  Of course the corn and potatoes.I included cod fish, salmon, shrimp, scallops, oysters, clams, and squid I wanted  but I didn\u2019t have any on hand.       In conclusion my dish was scrumptious. Thank you for helping me through your recipe in creating a dish of seafood medley.  Kevin, Washington DC",
