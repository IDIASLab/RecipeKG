All it said was to roll it in flour. When I mixed the egg yolks sugar and coconut I KNEW it wouldn't hold a shape so I decided the flour has to be added to the mixture. I thought the cookie tasted okay not great...pretty dry but it was alright. And the kids I made it for liked it so it seemed to be a hit with them. I rolled the cookies in powdered sugar after they were baked and cooled some. By the way if anyone is looking for unsweetened coconut & superfine sugar Kroger sells their own brand of both.",

You can use sweetened coconut flakes if you like your cookies on the sweet side. I use the unsweetened because I don't like overly sweet desserts. I use brown sugar but any finely ground sugar would work. I have also been experimenting with different flours. Some people have said on here that their cookies come out dry and this is a direct result of adding the flour to the batter when you should just ROLL them in the flour before placing them on the cookie sheet. When you do this your cookies will be moist and tasty with a powdery outside. So far I have tried all-purpose oatmeal flour a gluten-free flour and wheat flour all with good results. Again - don't add the flour to the batter!",
