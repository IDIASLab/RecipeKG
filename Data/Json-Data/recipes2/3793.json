It does have a lot of ingredients for canned black beans, a lot of spices to pull out of the cabinet and then put away.  Followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using red bell pepper (what I had on hand) rather than green, and I did add a bit more salt.  I took the lid off the pot after simmering to allow the liquid to cook down, just seemed a bit soupy to me.  Tasty recipe for a quick weeknight dinner, but I still prefer making black beans from scratch in the Instant Pot\u00ae.  Served with chopped onions and cilantro.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, we enjoyed it.",
