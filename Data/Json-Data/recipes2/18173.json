I originally ate the Swiss Oatmeal at Corner Bakery and wanted to see if I could make it at home. Corner Bakery's Swiss Oatmeal is fabulous!! This isn't AS good but is comparable and very healthy. The recipe is good as-is. I only change it up when I have fresh fruit in the house. Sometimes I chop up a peach 1/2 banana strawberries or blueberries versus the dry fruit. This recipe keeps me full well into the afternoon. Highly recommended for a healthy fulfilling breakfast.",
