The recipe I reworked for this cheese ball called for 1 pound of bacon fried, drained, and crumbled. I didn't have time for all that, so used the bacon bits and found them at least as good and less mess. Make sure your cream cheese is really soft, or else it is a little hard to mix well. Bon Appetit!",

The change I made was to use real bacon almost six strips of Safeway's thick sliced. I covered them differently so that the non-onion eater among us could distinguish hers. We thought these were very yummy though the one with the onions definitely had more flavor. I would definitely make this recipe again! Thanks marion!",
