I use 1 2/3 c Bisquick with one 6oz container of honey yogurt. Stir to combine and then use your hands to knead in because it will seem a little dry. I form into one big ball and when you can do this you know the texture is right. I spray an 8\" cast iron skillet with butter spray, pinch off a portion of dough, round it slightly and place in skillet. I yield 5-7 depending on size. I melt 2T of margarine and drizzle over top. I bake @425 (hot as mine will go) in a convection oven for 12-15 minutes. I'm using my store brand (Food Lion) honey yogurt. If using Yoplait you will have to add 1T of milk.",

I didn't know what drop biscuites were so I made a ball with the dough (about 1.5 to 2 inches) and flattened them and placed them on the cooking sheet. I also decided we needed some desert... so I rolled a ball of dough pushed my thumb in the middle and added some semi-sweet chocolate chips (about 10). Then closed the whole placed on sheet and sprinkled generously with sugar. Baked for about 9.5 minutes. Yummy! Thanks for the recipe! BTW; for those having trouble with the dough-you might be wanting to quit or add more yogurt too quickly. If you use 2 cups mix and 1 cup yogurt (8oz) you should be fine. Just stir until most of the mix is no longer dried and then knead with your hands.",
