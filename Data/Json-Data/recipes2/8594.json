Easy variations are to add pepper jack cheese, sausage, bacon or ham for breakfast.  Turn it in to a pizza bread by adding smoke mozzarella, pepperoni or salami.  Or a veggie bread by adding a variety of vegetables.  This bread is so versatile and forgiving you can add anything and it turns out well!  Thanks for the memories bfr610!",

I did find if you cut the biscuits into 8 pieces instead of 4 that does help and I baked the first layer of biscuits for about 10 minutes before adding the cheese and remaining layers.",

I thought the taste of this would compliment a large dinner salad really well and I was correct. My SIL had just given me a jar of the fresh jalape\u00f1os that she had canned. I drained them really well (between paper towel) and they were great in this recipe. It was doughy (in a good way) cheesy spicy and oh soooo delicious. I won't hesitate to make this again and make it for company. I look forward to trying another one of your recipes bfr610!",

Mine took 40 minutes to bake and it came out tasty and beautiful. The only thing I did differently was to chop up my jalapeno slices a bit to provide better distribution.
