My salad consisted of out-of-the-bag spring greens (mesclun) and baby spinach onto which I tossed a couple of handfuls of blueberries red and green grapes and mandarin oranges. The salad was surprisingly delicious. If I had added chickpeas and a piece of bread I would have considered the salad a complete meal. To save calories and fat just omit the cheese and peanuts.",

I would have loved the crunch from the cabbage though. I might use sliced almonds instead of peanuts next time as I think it would compliment the salad even better. Make the dressing ahead of time so the flavors have a chance to blend and don't forget the cumin! It adds wonderful flavor the dressing.",
