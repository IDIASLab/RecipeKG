I used all of the ingredients except I subbed regular sugar for the Splenda because it was what I had. I also left out the pineapple like another reviewer and just used 1 1.5 oz box of the cranberries. They were so extra moist that even after 20 minutes of baking a quarter of them wanted to stick and break in half. I think this would be best made into a cake cooked well with some kind of cream cheese or similar type frosting. The flavor is good and with a little work could make a nice presentation too.",

I got 36 mini muffins that each came out to 35 calories 1 gm each of fat fiber & protein and 6 gms carbs.",

It's still a little too sweet due to how sweet stevia is so I'll probably use 1/3 cup next time. I took the suggestions some other reviewers offered and used soy milk used all white flour and added allspice and used cinnamon and nutmeg since I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice on hand. I don't have mini muffin pans so I just used a regular muffin pan and it made 12 beautiful muffins by increasing the bake time by about 10 minutes! Also definitely grease the pans and don't use paper liners -that seriously didn't work! I'll be making these again tomorrow they were so good!",
