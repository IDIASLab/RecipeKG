The flavors are perfectly balanced and really makes zucchini delicious as you dip it in the sauce (my husband does not care for zucchini and loved this). I chose to marinade the beef with half of the sauce for 45 min. - 1 hour which resulted in the meat soaking in the flavor and tender for being sirloin. When dipping the beef in the sauce there seemed to be too much lime coming through but that's soley from my obvious adjustment to the recipe. This recipe is so good though that I didn't even realize I forgot to add the salt and pepper before grilling and didn't bother to add any after! Served over plain steamed white rice. Looking forward to making this again! Thanks for the recipe!",
