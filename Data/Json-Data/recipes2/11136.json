The prawns had a beautifully subtle flavor of the marinate and it was not overpowering. However just like Volleyballmom I also have a Heat Wimp in the house so only added half the cayenne and pepper flakes. But my Wimp didn't even notice the heat! So next time I'll add the entire amounts! Thanks Kaid711 for this wonderful recipe!",
