All natural peanut butter was used in place of the regular peanut butter 1/2 cup of plain non-fat yogurt was used in place of most of the milk and finally I used a frozen banana in place of room temperature. Additions also included 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed and 1/2 scoop of soy protein powder. Eliminating most of the milk and using the yogurt really makes this a \"shake\" instead of a \"drink\" as some reviewers stated. After tasting I added 1 tablespoon of organic agave for sweetness. This does make a nice thick shake.",

Then i add ice cubes. I use a heaping tablespoon of peanut butter. I'M NOT KIDDING IT TASTES JUST LIKE A MILKSHAKE. YUM!!
