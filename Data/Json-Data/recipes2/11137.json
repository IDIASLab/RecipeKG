I only had a scan half cup of feta, and I'm sure it would be greatly improved with extra feta.  I also used about 1 tbsp of Greek seasoning and no garlic powder, as there was garlic already in my Greek seasoning.  I chopped my red onion very finely, but I think next time I will grate it, as suggested.  I also used 1 tbsp of mustard and 1 tbsp of honey in place of the honey mustard and added the juice from 1/2 a lemon to brighten up the flavors.  I let it sit overnight in the fridge and the flavors were really nice the next day.\nThe recipe makes A LOT.  A great simple recipe to take to a party, or for a yummy lunch on a hot day!",

The fresh tomato was really quite nice but still overall the salad seemed lacking in flavour even after it sat for 3 hrs. So I added a Tbsp of granulated sugar 2 TBSP of white vinegar increased the feta to 1c (we really like it) and added an extra Tbsp Greek seasoning - that brought the salad to life. I'll make it again with these amendments. The recipe makes a lot. I'd say the servings should say at least 12 not 8.",
