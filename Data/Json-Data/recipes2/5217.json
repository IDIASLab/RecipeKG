I used it for galettes, and it worked every time! If it broke apart at all, you just simply pat it back together with your fingers, no problem. I did make some changes in one of the instances that I made this: 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup quick oats (left them as-is, and didn't make them into flour), brown sugar in place of white, 1/2 cup butter, and added some cinnamon and nutmeg too. I really liked the proportions with the slight changes, and adding the spices made it almost taste like a crisp topping! I also did refrigerate my dough each time before using (about an 1 hr) too. I will definitely be making this over and over again! Thank you for the recipe!",
