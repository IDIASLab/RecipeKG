        "description": "Had to make a sandwich for a challenge in a group for another site; she gave us two mystery ingredients: red wine vinegar and red bell peppers. We then had to build a sandwich around those ingredients; this is what I made. Give it a try! It's so tasty, one person said it looked like a fancy bistro sandwich and it WON THE CHALLENGE for that week! If you don't have seedless jam, you can either use it with seeds or heat a little and put through a fine strainer. I left the seeds in and they are so tiny, it wasn't a problem. Your choice!",
