I added about 3/4 cup canned pitted green olives (not the kind you find in a jar in a pickle brine) just because we love this type of olive and 1/3 cup of chopped kalamata olives as the recipe states.  I added about a teaspoon of drained and chopped capers also! I used the olive the tomatoes were packed in.  VERY FLAVORFUL! Wonderful with the cream cheese but also very good spread onto crostini bread! Thank you Alexis! This is a keeper!",
