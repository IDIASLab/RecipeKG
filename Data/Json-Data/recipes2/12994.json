                "reviewBody": "3.22.21 I try not to stray too far from a new recipe, but to me, this had \u201covercooked\u201d written all over it.  Recipe tells you to pound out the chicken to 1/8 inch (that\u2019s thin), cook in a skillet 3-4 minutes per side, and a little later, it heads into a 450\u00baF oven for 12-14 minutes.  IMO that will turn the chicken into a cinder.  So here\u2019s what I did.  I browned the chicken in a skillet until it was golden, and  at 1/8 inch, it then was cooked!   If you add the chicken broth to the skillet, and simmer for 10 minutes, you\u2019ll literally have no \u201csauce\u201d per se.  I think it wouldn\u2019t hurt to add more chicken broth, simmer intensifying the flavor, and that will also enhance the moistness of the chicken. Why cook \u201ccooked\u201d chicken in the oven at 450\u00ba for 12-24 minutes just to melt the cheese?  I skipped the cooking in the oven and put it under the broiler for several minutes to melt the cheese.  In the future, I\u2019ll pound out my chicken to 1/4 inch because I thought 1/8 was just too thin, I\u2019ll add more chicken broth, probably just a little thyme, and cook as described above.  This was very tasty, it\u2019s pretty simple, and just needs a little tweaking.  Don\u2019t want to discourage others from totally following the recipe, just wanted to explain what worked for me.  This chicken is good and worth your effo",
