Rub in just enough e.v.o.o. until a thick paste forms and evenly coats it. Allow meat to come to room temperature. Chop 1 lg. green pepper, 1 lg. red pepper and 1 med. onion. Set aside chopped onion. Use a whole package of Oscar Mayer Thick Cut bacon and slice into about 1/3\" pieces. Fry until brown and crisp then drain. Pour out extra fat until just the bottom is covered. Add onion and 2 or more tbsp. of h2o to deglaze pan. Once onions are transparent add peppers along with rest of fajita seasoning. Cook until veggies are soft. Take off heat and snip with kitchen scissors 2 tbsp. of fresh chives along with bacon and stir. Cover in serving bowl to keep warm. Grill your steak medium rare. Both sides should be seared with grill marks. Every grill is different, so you will have to be the judge on that part. Rest steak for 8 to 10 min. then divide meat evenly by cutting with the grain into three long strips. Then cut across the grain with the carving knife at a slight angle into thin strips. Place meat in bowl along with any juices and toss. Cover to keep hot. To serve use big warm tortillas. Place finely shredded cheese on bottom, then meat. Bacon mixture next along with choice of tomatoes,jalapenos,lettuce,sour cream and/or taco sauce. Serve with Spanish rice and Ortega refried beans. Don't forget the beer!  Try it this way and you will love this recipe.",

Am basically clueless when it comes to cuts of meat so I asked the butcher whether it needed to be cut across the grain and was told no. Don't know if this was the problem but I'll NEVER buy \"skirt steak\" ever again. The meat was like chewing on a tire and there was no flavor to the entire dish. Very disappointed in this recipe but I'm also willing to admit that there could have been operator error! Won't make this ever again. Sorry!",
