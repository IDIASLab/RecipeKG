I stuck to the recipe fairly closely although I rubbed the herb/olive oil mixture all over the chicken rather than just underneath the skin. I also stuck extra sprigs of rosemary and thyme and a good chunk of onion in the cavity along with the lemon. I roasted the chicken at 450 degrees for 20 minutes then reduced the heat to 375 degrees and roasted for another 20 minutes per pound. (I had a 5-1/2 pound chicken so it was in the oven about 2 hours) I poured about a cup of chicken broth into the pan at the beginning and the resulting juices made for a rich and delicious pan gravy thickened just slightly with a little cornstarch and more chicken broth. I served this with roasted Yukon Gold potatoes (in the same pan last 40 minutes of cooking) Cauliflower with a Kick Easy Garden Green Beans Pumpkin Soup and a tossed green salad with Creamy Peppercorn Dressing all recipes also from this site. With only six reviews this recipe is not receiving the attention it should.",

I only had skinless chicken breasts on hand so just put them on top the sliced lemon spread the chopped garlic rosemary thyme and olive oil mixture over the chicken and baked it for about 45 - 50 minutes. Probably should have baked them for a little less time. 40 minutes probably would have been about right for two chicken breasts that were almost 2 pounds. Be sure to scoop up some of the juices from the pan and drizzle on top the chicken before serving for extra flavor and moisture (if you over cook your chicken like I did). Will definitely use this flavor combination again.",

I used dried herbs (about 1/2-1 teaspoon each) skipped stuffing the bird with garlic and used margarine instead of the olive oil. I combined the margarine herbs 3-4 cloves of minced garlic lemon zest and salt & pepper in a food processor to get it mixed really well. Rubbed this under the skin and all over the chicken.
