The first time I made them exactly to the recipe, this last time I added in some frozen peas and chopped fresh carrot (which I know is frowned on by traditionalists, but I like it), and a bit of sage, and for my tastebuds it was even better. This is definitely going into my regular rotation, seems like there could be endless variation and still a happy outcome. Thank you so much Chef John!",

I put this with the meat.  \nI used bread flour and followed your recipe except I used shortening instead of lard.  I added much more water than the recipe suggests. Its common at this time of year with forced heat but finally I felt it was never going to have enough so I kneaded 2 min and popped it in the fridge. I waited 3 hours debating my desire to add peas.  I did not.  I was concerned my crust was going to be tough it handled differently than pie dough. I did struggle with sealing and crimping \nMy oven is a bear I baked 80 minutes .  I went by color, smell and the juices coming out if the vents . \nAfter the 10 minutes of grueling wait. I cut into the best thing. I've made in awhile .  I will make again .",
