My kids absolutely love it and I love that I can satisfy their never ending demand for hot dogs with something balanced and healthy. Thanks!:-)",

I did take the advise of one review and added thyme & marjorum as well as garlic which I usually add to everything and some chopped celery in addition to the mixed veggies (carrots cauliflower & broccoli).
