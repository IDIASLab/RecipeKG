Ask your grocer to order you a few cans if you have trouble finding them. They make this recipe. Now I do have a couple of personal changes to mention. I used 12 oz. of dried WW penne pasta. I think using a whole pound the broccolini and favas would get lost. I also added 2 heaping tbsps of fresh chopped basil with the beans and sundried tomatoes and sprinkled 1 tbsp on top after mixing everything together before sprinkling the cheese on top. If you can find smoked sundried tomatoes try them! They give a nice depth of flavor. Lastly I combined 3 cheeses - asiago pecorino romano and parm - again for more complex flavor. Thanks again lovesitaly!",

The broccoli was slightly undercooked the beans were on the mushy side the hot pepper flakes made it way too hot and the sun dried tomatoes just tasted too strong for my taste. It's odd as I like all of these flavors. They just didn't seem to come together for some reason. Although not the submitters fault the calorie count seems really off also. I figured it as 250 cal a serving before adding pasta to taste.",

It is very colorful with the bright green of the broccoli and red of the sun-dried tomatoes. Since I only had 1 bunch of baby broccoli I cut back on the pasta (about 10 ounces) and did not use whole wheat pasta as I didn't have any on hand. I used the full amount of all other ingredients. I served it with chicken on the side but next time would add cooked chicken to this dish. Quick easy and delicious! Thanks for the recipe.",
