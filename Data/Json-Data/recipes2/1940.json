This recipe was my go-to, and it\u2019s easy to adjust based on what you have or what your tastes are. I love spicy food, so I added lots of hot peppers. But my kids aren\u2019t as big of a fan, so I made a few batches for them without the heat. Still delicious! I suggest roasting the veggies all together until they are well browned. That gives the salsa a smoky taste! The longer the better, just don\u2019t burn it. I also drained off the extra liquid after roasting, but I like a chunky salsa. If you want it thinner, just use more liquid from the roasting pan.",

I doubled the recipe, so used 4 jalape\u00f1os all total. I tasted the salsa after running everything through the blender and it was a little hotter than I cared for but I wondered if my husband would like it. So I saved 1 1/2 cups of it and modified the remaining 2 1/2 cups. I added another pint of roasted tomatoes, 1/4 cup of cilantro,  1 tsp of salt and 4 small, raw cloves of garlic. I put the two variations in the fridge and tasted them a few hours later. Both were good but my husband and I preferred the one I doctored up. The heat was definitely still there so we think it may have been the added raw garlic that made us like it better. I will try this again!",
