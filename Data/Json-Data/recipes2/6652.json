                "reviewBody": "These were OK but I think personally for us they were wayyyy too \"oniony\" with both a large onion and a package of onion soup. Flavorwise they have potential but I would not make these again without making some adjustments like: 1 - grating a half onion and pressing out the liquid instead of using whole diced onion (don't like chunks of raw onion bites in my burger). 2 - Because onion soup is loaded with salt there is no need to add more. 3 - Not sure why two eggs are called for since there is no binder like bread crumbs so next time I'd use just one. 4 - These also were a bit dry and normally I'd never use lean beef in my burger. The pork sausage added a nice flavor enhancement but the flavor of a good burger comes from the fat and there is nothing better than ground chuck. Next time I will substitute one pound of the lean with an 85% chuck. HINT: When you form the patties poke the middle of the patty with your finger to form an indention in the meat. They cook more evenly on the grill.",

I also used a couple of hot Italian sausages instead of plain pork - added some heat and flavour.  Finally, I left the patties in the refrigerator for an hour or so to set before cooking.  Helps keep them together on the BBQ.  I will make this again.",

I scaled this down to use 1 lb of 80/20 ground beef and left out the pork sausage. I made a copycat recipe of the onion soup mix using a recipe from this site except I left out the salt and followed the rest of the recipe as written. It was good but oniony with both the dry onion soup as well as the additional chopped onion. Luckily for us we like onions and liked the burgers. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
