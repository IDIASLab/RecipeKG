I used a yellow zucchini which stayed kind of crunchy and nutty- very good. For the dressing i used half fat free italian and half fat free honey dijon. The whole thing therefore had a nice sweet taste nicely accented by the sharp taste of the feta cheese. I recommend this for a hot summer night or for a potluck. Very pretty presentation.",
