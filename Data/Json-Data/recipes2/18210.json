I ended up cooking them probably 10 minutes on each side (which might be normal I don't know). They did drip some onto the coals but not too much. I didn't have garlic or ginger paste so I substituted plain ground ginger and garlic though I reduced the amount of ginger by almost half. I also didn't have dry cilantro so I used ground coriander. Everyone liked it though there wasn't enough (I wasn't filled after 1 and my dad had 2 which is normal). Everyone was pleased though they didn't rave. I'll definitely take with recipe with me to college.",

I also added some bread crumbs as turkey has a WAY different consistency than lamb and it needed it. Also added a bit of salt. Thanks for such a great recipe!",

I was worried it would fall apart on the grill and fall into it. I formed patties the best I could and put them inbetween wax paper. I put them in the freezer for a couple hours so I had a better chance they wouldn't fall apart. This worked. I wouldn't say this was the best burgers ever. It was good but different. I thought it was sweet but had a good burger texture. I would much rather prefer a swiss and mushroom burger or a bacon cheddar burger over this. It was worth trying but I wouldn't be adding it to my family dinner routine. It was good don't get me wrong just not my style.",
