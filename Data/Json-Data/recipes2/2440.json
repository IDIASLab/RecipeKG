You should heat the vegetable oil first and then add the ginger and scallions for only 30 seconds to a minute.  You will see the ginger bubble and the scallion will become bright green.  Smell the aroma.  If you can smell it, then turn it off.  If you don't, then the ginger and scallion will burn shortly thereafter.",
