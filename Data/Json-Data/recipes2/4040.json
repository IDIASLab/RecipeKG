I used the carrots and celery the recipe called for and also added a bag of frozen mixed veggies that was taking up space in my freezer. My grocery store didn\u2019t have puff pastry dough so I used a Mrs. Smiths pie crust on the bottom and a roll out crust for the top. The flavors were great! Luckily I made 2 because they were a big hit and gave me leftovers for work the next day. Definitely a keeper!",

I used regular pie crust for the bottom and the fluffy pastry dough for the top. Butter onion & veggies fried first using a big bag of frozen mixed veggies and a store bought pre cooked chicken I just took all the meat off of. Okay so clearly this was a total pre-fab meal on my part but I'll tell you we had the regular 6 people from 6 yrs to 87 at the table and we all loved it! I added the flour to the veggie mix added the chicken chicken stock and spices using thyme marjoram and some seasoning salt. I also added a bag of Monterey Jack cheese after the mix was thick. Popped the cheesy mix in the pie shell once it was ready to go. I think I had it in there for about 45 min on 350-375 or till the top looked good. Thank you for sharing this recipe I know it's going to be a wonderful one people will ask for in my kitchen from now on.",
