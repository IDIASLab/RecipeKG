They only take a few minutes to saut&eacute;, so you don't have time to run and chop scallions or juice a lemon. Once everything is assembled, this recipe is a snap. To make things even easier, you can make the grits a bit ahead since they stay hot a very long time.",

I make a Cheese Grits Casserole often and it worked well for this dish, and added the make-ahead benefit!  The shrimp and sauce mixture was very tasty, and so good that I will make more sauce next time!  Recommend passing the shrimp thru the hot pan quickly, add the veg's, then sauce, then shrimp back to finish.  So easy to overcook shrimp!  This will be a great brunch dish!",
