To make PERFECT mini quiches use the Cream Cheese Tart Shells recipe on this site and also the Basic Quiche by Shelley. Use a mini muffin tin.

Baked at 350 for 15-20 minutes until edges were beginning to get golden. Ah they looked and tasted very professional!",

Bake as directed in the origiinal recipe.  I actually used a few dashes of ceyenne pepper, and a few shakes of salt.
