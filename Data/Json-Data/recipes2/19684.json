The other thing is that these are not \"refried beans\", so if that's what you are looking for you wont get with this recipe.  One suggestion though (from a Mexican), follow these directions as they are.  Once you have your cooked beans, take a skillet and pour some oil (maybe about 1/4 cup) heat the oil and take beans from the pot (drain the liquid first) and fry them in the oil.  Mash them up while they are frying.  You could also stir in some milk for a creamier texture.",

The only thing I change is when adding the water the second time - add one whole beer.  Any beer, but a medium ale is really good.  Not all beans taste good cooked with beer, but I think it really makes pinto's great.  Another trick, you can try covering and cooking them in a 350 degree oven instead of the stove top.  For some reason, the all around heat makes the texture better than the stove top.",
