I took this salad to a ladies dinner at church and came home with an empty bowl. I also made some in jell-o molds for my family. I used all the ingredients but halved the maraschino cherry amount. Make sure you drain your fruit really well. I did not cut the mandarin oranges in half they broke up nicely when I folded in the whipped topping. You could easily change up the jell-o flavor in this salad. Thanks bestrachan for sharing your Thanksgiving salad recipe.",
