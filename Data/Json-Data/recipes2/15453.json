However if this dish were unhealthy I would still be eating it - my family is addicted. I believe that fresh garlic should always be used instead of powder. Substitute 4 cloves minced fresh garlic for the garlic powder to make a huge flavor impact. This important modification makes the dish taste like you ordered it at a fine restaurant! I also didn't feel that the lemon pepper contributed positively so I removed it the next time I made it. Also I like celery in my chicken salad so I added it. I felt that the flavor and color contrasted nicely with the other ingredients. Thanks for this most excellent recipe!",
