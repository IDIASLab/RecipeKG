For not having to chop anything, and for typically having these ingredients on hand, it was easy and the end result chicken was flavorful w/o screaming \"herbs!\" or \"soy sauce!\"",

I'd think that had I thinly sliced the chicken and cooked it for that long on each side that it'd have been way overcooked.  As it was, this was wonderful!  This time I cut the recipe to 1 serving, but I almost wish I had a little more marinade that I could save off before adding the chicken so that I could drizzle it over some of the side dishes.  I'll do that next time.  You don't need to change a thing in the proportions of this recipe!  Thanks, Jennifer!",

The chicken is so soft and flavorful! I can\u2019t wait to try this on a steak too. Thank you so much for sharing! I\u2019ll definitely be using this a lot.",

Great flavor after grilling and very juicy! I let it marinate for about 4.5 hours. Also, I didn't have low sodium soy sauce, so I used slightly less than called for of the regular stuff (just added a teensy bit more vinegar instead) and it wasn't too salty at all. Don't be put off by the soy sauce taste if you try the marinade when you first mix it up, the finished product tastes wonderful!",

I didn\u2019t have parsley, but I\u2019m not that fond of it, so I did increase the basil and oregano slightly.  I guess if you had strong tasting sides it would be a good mild addition.",
