I on the other hand don't like ham hocks so I was happy to try this recipe. They worried me to no end saying they didn't see any ham hocks how are you cooking greens without ham hocks do you want us to run out and get some for you? I was concerned the red wine vinegar may be too overpowering but it was perfect. My entire family loved the greens and I caught my mom stashing some in the BACK of the freezer for later. Nice simple recipe thanks so much! By the way I added a small amount of crushed red pepper and I used hickory smoked bacon.",
