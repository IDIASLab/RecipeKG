My son said it was his favorite meal that I had ever prepared. Minor changes as follows: for chicken I used 1/2 panko & 1/2 italian breadcrumbs along w/ garlic salt, dried basil and parm. I cooked chicken through in pan so I omitted baking it in the oven.  Be sure though that you keep it warm and crispy in the oven b/c you have many more steps that follow. I also subbed heavy cream for half and half and used cheap parm from a can, which I will not do that again - go for the good stuff.  Will definitely make this again, although it is labor intensive - it is so worth it! Thank You for submitting.",
