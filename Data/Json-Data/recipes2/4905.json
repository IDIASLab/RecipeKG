Overall this is a lovely smoothie!",

Make it as is and you will have a tasty and super nutritional drink to start your day and get you through to lunch. Keep the chia and flax seeds in easy pour containers in the fridge and you're golden on adding the super -food ingredients so quickly. The beauty of this recipe is that it is really versatile and you can substitute what ever fruits and powders you prefer....I like to up the ante with a high quality protein powder like VEGA which is no-gluten and no sugar added. I love the frozen berry option (fast) and frozen banana to add a mellow flavor. When I'm craving the taste of PB&J I add a scoop of PB powder (all the flavor with less calories).  Love this solid go-to recipe every day !",
