Pasta salads are so easy and no matter what you add to them as long as the veggies are fresh, you use a good quality dressing, and it's chilled - it'll be delicious.  So add what you like. This recipe is a great base. I used tri-colored pasta, a whole bunch of cherry tomatoes that I cut in half and  added some black olives along with the rest of the ingredients. For the dressing I used Good Seasons Italian dressing mix (so it was kinda homemade, and kinda not). I also added some parmesan and romano cheeses.  This is a definite keeper!",

Here's the roasted veggie recipe (it's easy): 8 cups chopped veggies (your choice such as zucchini asparagus cherry tomatoes sweet peppers mushrooms etc) marinated in a bottle of your favourite dressing suggestions are parmesean basil greek or sundried tomato. Marinate for two hours tossing frequently. Grill on medium BBQ or in oven at 350 for 30 mins or until tender-crisp. Add to pasta salad. Yum!",

I like to use halved cherry tomatoes, for their sweetness, as well as a really good shaved parmesan (and lots of it!). You can experiment with different Italian dressings to find a flavor that suits you; I usually just go with whatever is on sale (!), but I'm not picky, and I don't think you could go wrong. Presuming you make this ahead of time, I would suggest reserving some dressing to mix in  just before serving -- or even adding extra, as I have -- as the pasta will soak up a lot of it. I also add more parmesan when I give it a final toss, for added texture.   This recipe is kind o a no-brainer, as it's just so easy and good. It's a staple in my repertoire!",
