After tweaking a few things, I think I have come up with a great copy-cat version.  The curry paste can easily be substituted with the mild version for those with more sensitive palates.  Serve over Basmati rice. I hope it meets your liking.  Enjoy!",

I had no fresh mango so I went to the freezer and used a tropical fruit mix I use for smoothies which had papaya mango and pineapple. I also used half a sweet onion in place of the shallots and added sliced red bell pepper and snow peas and let them simmer in the sauce with the chicken for about ten minutes. I did not add any seasonings but also was fairly heavy handed with the curry paste. The balance of sweet with spicy was really really delightful.
