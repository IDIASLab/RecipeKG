We just chop everything up in the food processor, transfer to a bowl, add eggs & evaporated milk, transfer to a baking dish (coated with Pam for easy clean-up!) and bake at 350 for about an hour.  The flavor is AMAZING!!!  We also serve with a dollop of sour cream.  (Just as a note - you can freeze leftover ham (from holidays) and leftover bacon and thaw them out when you're ready to make the Kugeli! :)",

More like mashed potatoes than koogilie. my Mom used to grate the potatoes by hand on a box grater and got little granules of potato instead of smush. Grinding 5 pounds by hand is a chore and little bits of knuckle don't improve the flavor. I found by first using the carrot shredding blade in the processor the one that rides at the top of the processor bowl and then carefully pulsing 1/2 bowl batches with the regular blade I can easily get the right textured bits of potato. Doesn't add much time and just one extra blade to wash but what a difference in taste. We also omit the flour and use a can of evaporated milk for 5 lbs of potatoes. Mom said the milk prevented the mix from turning grey before cooking.",
