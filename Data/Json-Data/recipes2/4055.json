It's the best homemade S&S sauce I've made so far.  I use the recipe as a base and season to our liking.  I've also made different variations.  Smoked oyster, beef bacon and feta with buffalo dipping sauce.  Parmesan chicken with mushrooms and spinach with Chef John's mushroom gravy.  I folded it as directed and also in a triangle.  While the triangle is easier, the crispy edges from the \"pyramid\" folding are better tasting.  I just need to master getting all they air out so the don't explode.  Great recipe.

So I had to ditch the nicer fold suggested by Chef John and doubled the wrap. This time it kept really well (although it wasn't as pretty and you don't get the crispness of the edges). One reviewer said to make sure you get all the air out to avoid bursting. Too bad I saw that suggestion too late.  But doubling the wrap worked for me.\nBy the way, if you do the simple triangle fold, you could keep them in a freezer bag and take them out to fry the following day and cook from frozen.\nI also used a different sweet and sour sauce. But the crab rangoon was really delicious. Thanks again Chef John for a wonderful receipe. Keep them coming! :)",

Just spread the cream cheese over flour tortillas to within 1/2 inch of edges mix crab with a little mayonnaise & seasonings and put about 1/2 cup into center of each tortilla. Fold side in to make a square packet & use toothpicks to hold together if desired. I found I didn't need them if I browned the edge side first. Cook about 5 minutes on each side in about 1 inch of peanut oil in a large fry pan at 400 degrees. Yum! PS: If you have tortillas left over cut them into triangles & brown in same oil. Drain on paper towels & sprinkle with powdered sugar and a little cinnamon. You have a great dessert as well.",
