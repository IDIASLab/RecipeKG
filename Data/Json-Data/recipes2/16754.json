I'd recommend starting with 1/2 a cup and adding more slowly until you get a good texture for rolling the burgers. Also, I agree that the curry might have been a little much, and may try cutting some of it in favor of more cumin and maybe some paprika next time. However, the cooked mushrooms and scallions are a wonderful touch and the burgers were great! (Crumbling problems can be solved by rolling the balls very well between your hands before flattening them into burgers.) I served mine on a sesame whole grain bun with tahini and a big slice of tomato, and put some greens tossed with a little more tahini on the side. I'm definitely saving this recipe!",

I added more bread crumbs to \"firm\" it up but that made it taste too \"bready.\" I didn't have any mushrooms when I made these so I substituted grated carrots.
