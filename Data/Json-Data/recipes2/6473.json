Followed the recipe almost exactly (drained and rinsed the black beans which was not specified in the recipe. Glad we did.)  Threw in the entire can (15 oz) of tomato sauce so we wouldn't be stuck with a half can. Also left out the seasoned salt completely after tasting it first - it didn't need it, it was plenty salty. Loved the sundried tomatoes in this even though I thought I would hate it, and I hate black beans but can barely notice it here.  Also read a cool trick for spaghetti squash - cut it in half, scoop out the seeds, add half a cup of water and place the other half back on it.  Microwave 12 minutes for a pound - if the top half is soft when it comes out, it's done. Otherwise, put it back in for a few more minutes.",

I used a 6 oz can of tomato paste to with 1 cup water and Italian seasonings and used all of it. I had a couple of moments of confusion - the \"1 cube of chicken bullion\" should read 1 cup of chicken broth as you need the liquid and could use actual broth or cube or granules to make broth. The other was that you really want to start the turkey mixture before the squash is ready or your squash will get cool. Excellent taste and very healthy.",
