The only thing I do different is add more spices such as garlic and red pepper. You do not need the marinades IF your venison has not been in the freezer a long time. The sooner it's prepared the tastier it is. One note...be careful not to overcook venison. Depending on the size of your steak you will not need to cook it this long. Ours were smaller and didn't require the full 10 minutes on each side to be cooked to medium well-well done (no blood). Overcooking venison completely changes the taste and in fact gives it a powdery consistency.",

As a suggestion check the steak frequently as 10 minutes is too long for most steaks.",
