I followed the recipe pretty closely with just a couple of exceptions steamed asparagus instead of boiling and used honey in place of agave and just a little more than the recipe called for. I marinated this overnight turning the bag every so often. It was delicious. A great spring/summer side and I'll use this many more times. Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.",

My only tweak was to use about a teaspoon of Sriracha instead of the pepper flakes. Yummy and thanks!",

Marinated (with frequent turning) in fridge for 4 hours. Great as a nutritious, cold side dish for BBQ. Easy to take to a potluck, & makes a beautiful presentation with the sesame seeds on top! Next time I will add the water to the marinade; both to fully submerge the asparagus, and to slightly dilute the tasty, but decidedly piquant, flavor of pure marinade alone. Be sure to cook your asparagus al dente, because they will get \u201climper\u201d with the marinade. Great recipe!",
