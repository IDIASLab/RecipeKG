I had no idea which Miso paste to buy and since I can\u2019t read the kanji I ended up buying a red and white combination.  Appearance and taste differs between the two.  I used dried shitake mushrooms that I rehydrated along with silken tofu.  Served to my Japanese friend and her two year old and the two year old had three helpings and kept saying \"oishii\", delicious.  Even my 22 month old devoured the stock, pushing aside the mushrooms and tofu.  I will make it again and will look for more similar recipes.",

My very picky friend loved it, too, so it's safe to say that it's a wonderful recipe. ",

I went ahead and rated this recipe because the base was really good and I thought my substitutions I had to make might help someone else who cannot find Dashi stock or Miso paste to at least have a clear soup with Asian flavor. I used the soup as an appetizer to Sushi. Instead of Dahi stock & Miso paste I used chicken stock and added about 1 1/2 tsp of chicken base & freshly cracked black pepper & then added the Soy Sauce. I followed recipe directions as best as I could except I cooked green onion in broth for a very few minutes instead of waiting to use as garnishment. I also added at the last minute a hand full of roughly chopped fresh spinach leaves until they were wilted. Soy tofu mushrooms all helped to give it an Asian flavor. It was very good!
