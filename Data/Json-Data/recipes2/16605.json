Try this next time -- it was a hit with my family:\n\nIn large fry pan add 1 cup vegetable broth, 1 Tbsp. minced garlic, 1 tsp. liquid smoke and 1 cup water.  Bring to a low boil.  Then, cut tempeh at a diagonal for wider slices and simmer them in broth for 20 minutes, turning occasionally as liquid reduces.  Remove from heat and place on a slice of lightly toasted rye, top with sauerkraut and swiss, put under a broiler for a minute so that the cheese melts, add your top slice of rye and serve with thousand island dressing.   \n\nEven my finicky 8 year old loved this one!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a dangerous recipe for me - delicious - I have missed reubens! Here is my version: Pumpernickel bread (Beefsteak brand) 2 pkgs tempeh makes 8 sandwiches. Slice each tempeh in half to make two squares. Slice those squares in half lengthwise (so that they are twice as thin - really it works!) Sprinkle the slices with soy sauce before browning them in a little oil in a saute pan. Remove. Brush one side of bread with butter place butter-side down on griddle layer one slice tempeh cheese 'kraut top bread layer. Flip them carefully! When cheese melts and bread is crisp open and spread the inside of each piece of bread (not just one side!) with sauce. Slather. Cut in half serve. (My children only ate a half sandwich each so you could say this makes 16 servings but the leftovers are so good - also it uses up the whole loaf of pumpernickel and less kraut to throw away afterwards so I say make a big batch). The sauce I used was a sort of thousand island minus the relish: 1 c. mayonnaise 1 tsp. Worcestershire sauce 1/4 c. catsup 1 tsp. grated onion You can also dip into the sauce instead of slathering the bread. I love the slather...messy though. My version has butter and worcestershire as well as real swiss so it's not technically vegetarian. I think this recipe would get lots more attention if we had a better picture!",

I'm embarrassed as a vegetarian to say I had never heard of tempeh but I am so glad I tried it!!!! My meat loving sister asked if it tasted like corned beef and I had to say no but with marinating the tempeh in soy sauce as per reviews it captured the saltiness of corned beef and along with the very distinct strong reuben flavors of the saurkraut swiss cheese rye bread and 1000 isle dressing I didn't miss the meat at all! I am going to make for my meat loving husband to see what he thinks next! THANK YOU MEL FOR SUBMITTING THIS GEM!!!!!!!!",
