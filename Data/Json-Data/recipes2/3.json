Those that have sensitivities to spicy foods were not as big of fans as the rest of us. I followed the recipe with a few minor tweaks: I wasn't sure how many ounces were a pound (and I'm totally ok w/admitting that) so I used 16 oz of shredded Swiss I used canned diced jalaps and I'm not a mayo fan so I used 1/2 mayo w/EVOO and 1/2 FF sour cream. Great stuff! My grocery store didn't have a red cabbage so I had to use a (pricy!) green cabbage. If presentation is a MUST I'll keep the cabbage. If not I'll save the and use a pretty serving dish. TY for an interesting change of pace appetizer NKW!",
