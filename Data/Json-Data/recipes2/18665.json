But still mmmarvelous!\" The reviews complaining of this recipe being bland evidently didn't see the submitter saying to add more of any seasoning to your taste and frankly I did just that but I imagine it would be fine as written since adobo seasoning and smoked sausage are both such flavorful ingredients. I halved the ingredients (for 3 people) added a bay leaf 2 minced garlic cloves diced yellow bell pepper and surprisingly swapping sherry for apple juice as that's all that I had LOL. I let mine simmer for 1.5 hrs. so the chickpeas wouldn't be as my husband calls them \"pebbley\" and really I thought this was pretty tasty but just boring of color so when I make it again I'll have to throw in some zucchini kale tomatoes or whatever for some additional color and zip.",

                "reviewBody": "UPDATE: Still making this, still loving it. To make this in the Instant Pot, saute the smoked sausage and onions on Saute mode. Then add everything else, scrape up the bottom to make sure nothing triggers the dreaded burn notice. Cook on high pressure for 20 minutes (the equivalent of an hour on the stove; it will take 10ish minutes to come to pressure), then quick release the pressure. ORIGINAL REVIEW: After one bite, the husband said 'Instant Classic', which means, 'Get this into the recipe book, it's going to be part of our regular rotation'. It's so inexpensive to make (Hillshire Farms Lite Smoked Sausage goes on sale so frequently) and essentially a cupboard meal for us. Served it over brown rice. The only thing is that it was quite salty AND SPICY!!!! I had to actually add a spoonful of sour cream to mine to tame/cool it down some. I will add one heaping teaspoon of crushed red pepper next time instead of the full 2 teaspoons.  I also like to use a whole 15 oz can of low sodium tomato sauce because I like the extra sauce when serving it over rice.  I saute the sausage and onions together - I didn't see much come out of cooking the sausage on its own. It only saves 5 minutes, but when you have a screaming kid, every second counts! I also used no salt added tomato sauce, low sodium chickpeas,  marsala (since I only have cooking sherry at home which has added salt to it), and served it on plain brown rice. It's still salty but the flavors really come through.",
