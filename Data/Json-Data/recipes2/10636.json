I used 4 large cloves of garlic substituted one can of tomatoes with fire-roasted tomatoes and started with one package of instant potatoes with applewood bacon (couldn t find the chipotle flavor) and slowly added about another quarter package until desired thickness. I did add about 1 Tbs of reduced sodium taco seasoning to balance out the flavors. Soup is always better a day or two later so make it ahead if you can. Would definitely make it again.",
