                "reviewBody": "This recipe needs a lot of help, and with tweaks it could definitely be a 4 or 5 star recipe.  First, it's not stated what type of rice wine to use... shaoxing, mirin, or sake? They are very different.  There is way too much marinade for the small piece of salmon. I made half the amount and it was still plenty.  I would definitely season this with salt and pepper before cooking as it was bland. The cooking temp has got to be an error. I like to make recipes as written, even against my better judgement, but this was nowhere cooked. 255F is way too low to get the internal temperature up to an edible reading in that short of time, or for it to char as stated. Try at least 350F for 15 mins.  I had to use the broiler for a few minutes to get it cooked, browned and presentable for a picture. The cook's notes state to marinate up to 2 days. Thankfully I only did 8 hours because the salmon was getting a very bizarre and firm, almost candied texture, close to what hot smoked salmon texture is. Thankfully it didn't affect the final dish. Instead of tossing the marinade, you could simmer it on the stove to thicken, and serve over the fish.",
