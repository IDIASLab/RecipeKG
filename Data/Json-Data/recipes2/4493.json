Turned out great I will definitely be making this again!",

The rosemary made it smell yummy and the tomatoes gave it a nice punch of flavor. My husband really liked it (he put Tobasco sauce on it - loves the stuff). It's a good idea to let it sit for a few minutes before cutting into it so everything can set and not be too messy when you cut into it. I will definitely make this again.",
