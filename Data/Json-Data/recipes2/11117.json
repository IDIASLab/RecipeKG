Did not add the maple syrup to the crust as we used local extra dark maple syrup and thought it would be too sweet. Sadly I was mistaken as no one tasted even a hint of the maple syrup and it just tasted like a normal plain cheesecake I usually make. It was good but definitely need something to boost the maple flavor.....",
