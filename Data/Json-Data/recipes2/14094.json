Even today, after well over 24 hours of refrigeration, it is still very loose.  I DID cook the pudding properly (I grew up making cooked pudding -- my mother hated instant).  Perhaps it was the cocktail juice that prevented it from firming -- however, I did not even add the full cup because I didn't get that much out of my can.  Mine did not look like the picture, either.  All the fruit sunk to the bottom.  Also, I did add sugar to the whipped cream (I never made it without sugar before and did not like the flavor when I tasted it, so I added some) and used quite a bit of it on each piece of pie to try to cover up its sloppy appearance.",
