I added some other veggies (celery and mushrooms) to the stuffing because I wanted to use them up but even if I subtract the time it took me to chop those the prep/cook time for this dish is way underestimated. I did most of the work the night before and by the time I washed/chopped the pepper and parsley cooked the sausage and rice cleaned boiled separated and chopped the onions then mixed and stuffed them it took me almost 2 hours. That's not even including melting the butter and baking them the next day. I recommend getting really big onions. When I boiled mine I had to discard the first one or two layers because they were too mushy. I don't think I boiled them too long either bc the inner layers were still pretty firm and it was hard to pop them out without tearing the outer layers. The flavors and instructions in this recipe are great as far as stuffed onions go but I just don't think the concept of stuffed onions is worth the effort.",
