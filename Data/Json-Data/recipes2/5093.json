I don't normally buy bottled dressings so I wasn't sure which to get. I bought one of the famous brands ahem rhymes with raft. I wouldn't recommend using theirs. The dressing isn't affecting my rating though since it's one I chose. However I did find using a full bottle to be a LOT of dressing so use your judgement on that one. I appreciate the time saved by using a bottled dressing but next time I will just make my own. I also had to increase the fresh basil and oregano because we could barely taste it.",
