(Blackstrap molasses at least gives you a level of very absorbable iron for your blood if you ladies feel anemic.) The previous comments lead me to suspect they're imagining the incorrect form of chicory. Chicory root is the correct form--a brown woody/grainy type of product that looks similar to ground-up coffee beans. In other words NOT the chicory that's a leafy green a somewhat bitter type of lettuce for salads or soups). Chicory root has a beautiful true-blue flower on it. Chicory root mellows out coffee's bitterness rather than making coffee moreso. You won't find a bitter cup of coffee in New Orleans because most coffee served there is creole coffee. Slaves brought it with them to this country from Africa. When coffee was among the many goods that were harder to get during the Civil War Southerners made-do by using chicory root.",
