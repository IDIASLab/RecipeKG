The flavors of bacon and bourbon make it richer than any stuffing I've ever had, and I always get requests for the recipe. There's no good way to mix this without using your hands, so just dive in and do it! Egg-type breads such as challah, may be substituted for dark breads.",

I made a quarter of the recipe since we don't need 2 9x13 pans of stuffing and I used 1 cup of chicken stock instead of 2. I think bf would've liked this more without the bourbon--and I only added a a tablespoon or so of it. Other than that this was a nice stuffing. I'd prefer the darker breads the recipe called for but we have way too much bread right now for me to get something different. Thanks for the recipe!",
