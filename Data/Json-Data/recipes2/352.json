Spooned the sauce over top when they were done cooking. I didn't have any peppers for the sauce so I used a healthy tsp of sambal oelek (chili paste) for spice. The sauce is just amazing!

I skipped the frying because the chicken legs were pretty big in my opinion to do that - but followed the recipe to a T and instead baked at 375 degrees until done (about 35-40 minutes). Before baking I did spray with some cooking spray. If I were to make the wings themselves I would follow the recipe. However the legs were crispy skin (just look at the photo!) and man the skin that was almost the best part of the recipe (with the sauce of course!)",

But that can easily be squared away I thought it was fine myself. However when serving the sauce with the chicken wings I strained the sauce of the bites of Serrano peppers and ginger due to a kid that has a gag issue...it's something that is not necessary but in my house it was. The whole recipe was just a knock out winner and believe it or not but after the wings were coated and baked they still had a nice crunch to them. No one walked way from these babies. Will totally make again and again. Thanks Marion!",

I didn't have high hopes of the cracker crumbs staying put during the deep fry process. Quite surprisingly they did! I was a little overzealous with the addition of the sauce - I added a little too much making it pool around the wings which in turn made them less than crispy.

Possibly my wings were too large or the recommended amount of time in the fryer was not long enough because the skin on the wing was still mush (gross) and I was hoping for a nice crisp skin or the sauce should not be added during baking because even with a light coating it caused the breading to become mush. Next time I will fry much longer than the recommended 1-2 minutes to crisp up the topping and the skin. I also see no need to add the sauce to the wings during bake time since you are dipping them anyway. If I did add the sauce I would add during the last 3 minutes of cook time. Like other reviewers said the chicken itself was very bland as were the crackers so you needed to drown it in the sauce to give it flavor. Next time I would season the chicken and the crackers crumbs with salt pepper and garlic. The sauce was delicious and definitely makes this recipe worth trying again!",
