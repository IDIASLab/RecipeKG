I don't know why they changed the recipe because the original one was great. The differences are...use cream of celery soup instead of the mushroom soup, use 1 1/2  cups milk instead of 2 1/2, use 4 cups cooked penne, which is 2 1/2 cups uncooked or 8 oz., use mozzarella instead of cheddar and use the cheddar French Fried Onions. Put together the same way but bake uncovered for 30 minutes before adding remaining onions and cheese and baking the additional 3 minutes. I did make 2 variations from this recipe, I used 2 cups fully cooked cubed ham instead of the sausage only because my husband doesn't like sausage, and I used half mozzarella and half cheddar. This turned out great and was loved by everyone. The changes I made weren't enough to affect my rating because this would be excellent as written (magazine version). Give it a try.",

I used Turkey Smoked Sausage and mini wheel pasta and mixed everything together including the French fried onion and cheese.

Its so rare in our home with such a young child to find one dish that everyone can fill up on! This was actually the 1st time our daughter was offered smoked sausage to eat - and she loved it!

After eating it we all agreed that it could have used more green beans. I think next time I'll add two cups of green beans. I also think a lighter cheese would be better. Maybe shredded parmesan at the end or monterey jack or even provolone. I feel like Cheddar was a bit much for the meal. I also substituted linguisa (Italian sausage) instead of what the recipe called for. It is wonderful though. I really recommend it to others!",
