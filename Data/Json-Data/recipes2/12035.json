Though when you eat it on its own you notice it's got something in there.  It still tastes like cornbread just with that subtle hint of natural-almost squash but nutty-flavor that if you don't know it's pumpkin you'll have a hard time placing.  I used buckwheat flour to make this gluten free and frankly, couldn't taste it at all.  I ate this with lentil stew and it handled well when wet and didn't turn to mush as soon as it hit the liquid. I actually made this to be used in gluten free cornbread dressing for Thanksgiving.  Definitely try this out if you want something different but not too out there.  Thanks sueb.  A sure winner here.",

I had a small container of opened pumpkin in the fridge so I made a half batch and baked it in the toaster oven. The pumpkin added a nice dimension to the cornbread. It was moist but yet still had the cornbread texture. I think this would make a wonderful bread to go with soups and chili. I served this with 'Oven Roasted Ribs' and 'Classic Texas Caviar' both from AR. Thanks sueb for sharing your recipe we enjoyed it!",
