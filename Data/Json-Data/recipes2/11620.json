I chose to saut\u00e9 the garlic first until fragrant and then add the greens. I also always salt/pepper at every step as opposed to simply at the end. I halved the recipe for just me and the egg to greens ratio was a bit off for me but that is an easy fix. This was make a really nice egg component to a breakfast sandwich. Thanks for the recipe!",
