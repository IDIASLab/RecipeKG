I was okay with the olive oil, unsure about the lemon-pepper seasoning, but was open to trying it. As I expected, I really was fine with a light brushing of olive oil on the meat as it helped keep it moist during the broiling process.  I did NOT like the lemon-pepper seasoning, however, which for me dominated the rich flavor of the lobster that is so good all on its own.",
