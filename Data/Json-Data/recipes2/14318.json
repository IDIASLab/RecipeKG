Very good if eaten right away so lettuce doesn't wilt and tomato liquid doesn't penetrate tortilla too much. I'm not fond of soggy bread stuffs. The second batch I added 1/3 cup sour cream 2t garlic powder 1T chopped chives and 1t dried cilantro to the cream cheese. I used roma tomatoes (used only the meat of the tomato not the seeds and liquid.) These changes made my family happy by adding a tastier flavor to the cream cheese and preventing the tortilla from getting too soggy with the tomato seeds and liquid. I will be making these again with my modifications. Thanks for a great idea Joan.",

I pretty much echo the comments by fellow reviewers: FRESH tortillas are a must skip the tomato unless serving immediately definitely add powdered ranch (far far too bland without it) and make sure you've plenty of toothpicks at hand. Using pre-shredded lettuce (as recommended here) makes this a far easier task. Also if you want to eat these as more of a meal than a bite-sized snack use burrito size tortillas and slice into two pieces. Overall these are pretty tasty and the sky's the limit for ingredients! Don't forget the powdered ranch though!!",
