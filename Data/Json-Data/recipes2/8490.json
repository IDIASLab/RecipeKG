I added a bit more butter to compensate to compensate for the chops that (I assume) would tend to be a bit drier than the shanks.  They still turned out very tender. \n\nMy only concern with the recipe is the beginning step when the instructions say to sear under high heat using butter and olive oil.  It is my understanding that both butter and olive oil work better in lower heat applications.\n\nI did follow the recipe as instructed, and the butter burned to a dark brown. Not sure if this is the intent.  I think when I make it again I will use vegetable oil, and add the butter later, just before adding flour.\n\nOverall, though, I really liked the way it turned out.  Will become part of the rotation for sure,",
