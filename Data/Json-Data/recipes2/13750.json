Instead of boiling your onions and celery in chicken broth I saut\u00e9ed them in stick of butter with salt and pepper. I also added half of a bell pepper for a little extra flavor. Alsoto add a little more flavor instead of 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken. I also added about half of a can of milk. I mixed the onions bell pepper and celery with the cream of mushroom soup and the cream of chicken soup. I also added salt and pepper to taste. I choose not to add the mushrooms. Everyone really enjoyed these changes but I have to agree it is a lot of food.",

I added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt, 1/4 teaspoon of garlic pepper, 1/2 teaspoon of salt-free Cavender's Greek seasoning, and 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon of poultry seasoning.  That seemed to fix it.  I used Velveeta cheese and just melted it in the pan and didn't bother to cook it in the oven like a casserole.  We just filled our plates from the pan and served it with crescent rolls and a salad.  I did have to add a bit more broth to thin it down a little.",

With the left over broth I added two tablespoons of chicken bullion. Plus basil instead of parsely and some garlic salt. I doubled the onions celery and chicken broth (2 cups of broth). Canned chicken works just fine! I also substituted egg noodles for the spaghetti. I can't believe how much better it tastes now. I hope others will try it. You might be surprised.",
