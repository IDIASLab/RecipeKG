For fruit filling she always used drained pineapple tidbits or crushed pineapple. it is very important to drain it well and she would press it to get more of the liquid out. Tasty but probably less authentic Czech variation....But my grandmother was the daughter of Czech immigrants and this was otherwise the same as their handed down recipe. She just liked the pineapple variation which just shows that you can use different fruit fillings to your liking. I love them!",
