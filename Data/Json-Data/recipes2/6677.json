I followed the recipe as close as possible (with the exception of the garlic; I used pre-minced garlic and probably put a bit much in there). I initially thought they turned out too runny using half of the reserved liquid but after the beans cooled down a bit they turned out great! Quick and very easy recipe to make and has a good foundation to expand upon for those creative or adventurous amateur cooks.",
