Having made other bread and cake recipes using potatoes, and looking at the water to flour ratio, I decided prepared potatoes would be the best.  I did not hand knead, but used my KitchenAid mixer to knead the dough on speed 2 for about 3 minutes. The recipe produces a rich flavor and a soft, almost moist texture. While the loaves are a little on the small side, they would be perfect for toast and jam or breakfast breads, or just to eat slathered with butter. Additionally, I brushed the tops with butter directly after removing them from the oven, to accomplish a soft buttery top. (I do this with almost all of my bread recipes)",

If this is the one that was meant, the confusion was whether to rehydrate the potatoes and use 1 cup of those, or use one cup of t he granules which would see to take up all the liquid.  I chose to hydrate the potatoes.\n\nHowever the flavor was very good and the bread is nice and soft.  This recipe did not make very large loaves.",

                "reviewBody": "I made the recipe as written and believe reviews should be left as such.  The reviews are correct regarding the confusion involved in the recipe (dry flakes or already made).  I've made a lot of bread over the course of time (family owned bakeries), and the ratio seemed off to me, but , if you make this with dry flakes, your bread will be TOO DRY, will take forever to rise, and your best bet would be to use a Kitchen Aid to knead it as it would be a real pain to try to get this to work for you with dry potato flakes.  Your liquids would virtually be sucked out of the equation. My suggestion would be to follow suggestions involving making the mashed potatoes and using a cup of already made mashed potatoes OR adding more liquid if you've progressed forward and realized this wasn't working out for you.  I agree that it can use a bit more sugar.  This recipe has 4 1/2 cups of flour when approximately 3 cups makes a loaf.  I just think that there isn't clarity in the ingredient category which can be clarified better as stated by other reviewers. Regardless, if you wait long enough, your bread will actually rise if you made it the way it seemed to direct, but it might not produce the kind of bread you were hoping to achieve.",

However! I did have decent luck by not using the full amount of flour while making the dough, and allowing the dough to rise a little while longer than the recipe called for.  I would guess I ended up only using 2.5 cups of flour. I stopped adding flour when the dough seemed like I could knead it without sticking to it a lot. At that point I kneaded the dough until it felt right. I would say I let the dough rise about 1.5-2hrs for the first rise and about 45 min for the second. I may try it again with the prepared mashed potatoes, but honestly the way it came out was pretty good! Will make again.",
