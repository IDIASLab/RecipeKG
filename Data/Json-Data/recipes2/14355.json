                "reviewBody": "Thanks mauigirl....for posting this so I could make it. It was quite wonderful, slightly rich without it being sweet. If that makes sense,my only part in the recipe that stumped me, was whether or not, I should have or shouldn't have drained the pineapple. I didn't and it took an extremely long time to thicken...which I think I should have drained the pineapple. I ended up adding some cornstarch to help, and turned up the heat just a little to speed things along. The pineapple topping is not sweet, so I added just a tsp of splenda to knock just a little of the tartness down, however, it was still wonderful. The cake was super moist and flavorful as well as the pineapple topping...I will make again. And my kids like it too!! TY",
