It's also very versatile so you can add different spices and vegetables as the mood strikes! You can also experiment with different vinegars and beans in the recipe. Can be served immediately or refrigerated overnight to allow flavors to combine and the vegetables to marinate in the liquid. Pasta sauce may be used instead of tomato sauce.",

This recipe is very amenable to modifications - we put in an extra tbsp of pasta sauce 2 tbsp of rice vinegar parsley and sundried tomatoes and didn't use celery and dill and it turned out great. The vinegar is essential b/c otherwise the garlic and onions taste too raw. We might try sauteeing the garlic and onions first next time. Would definitely make this again... could be a great entertaining dish.",
