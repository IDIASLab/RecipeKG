I drink a lot of smoothies and, unfortunately, simply didn't care for anything about this one.  The cocoa powder totally dominates, there's no strawberry flavor at all, not even a hint of vanilla...unsweetened cocoa powder was all I could taste.  The smoothie was \"chalky\" for lack of a better word and left the inside of my mouth coated.  Sorry, Melissa Hart, for the unfavorable review.  This is the first review, and I don't want to discourage others from trying, but this recipe just didn't work for me.",
