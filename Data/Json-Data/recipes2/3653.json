I used Mediterranean Herb hummus which worked well for us.  A side of rice paired nicely. After tasting the finished product, we felt that the chicken would be better with salt and pepper sprinkled on it before coating with the hummus, and that the paprika was overpowering the hummus a bit.  Next time I would decrease the paprika by half.  Overall, I thought this recipe was easy and tasty and used things I normally have in my house.  I really like using hummus in a main dish.",

I used this recipe as a launching pad and substituted what she had on hand. Two leeks and a huge fresh jalape\u00f1o instead of the onion and bell pepper....half a container of spicy red pepper hummus from Costco....two chicken breasts and two ground chicken patties. I marinated the chicken for an hour in the juice of the other lemon half along with sriracha cumin salt and pepper....and then quickly seared it. I baked at 450 according to directions and then sprinkled with toasted chopped macadamia nuts. It was absolutely delicious served with brown rice and yogurt-cumin roasted cauliflower. A gourmet meal from odds and ends! Thank you submitter of this recipe for a great idea and for graciously allowing me to post modifications. --Cooking with love",

                "reviewBody": "Wasn't bad but as I do with almost all these recipes I made modifications where I saw fit. For starters, the hummus. I went with the \"supremely spicy hummus\" by Sabra to help prevent the bland flavor I see all over the reviews. Swapped the green pepper for a red pepper. No lemon juice either on one breast to compare flavor. Personally I liked the contrast of spice and citrus but it's your call. Also didn't need that much paprika for only 2 breasts, need about 1/2-3/4 the quoted amount. Still was a little on the bland side so after it cooked I added my own mixture of spices to flavor it up. I suggest playing around with what flavors you like to see what you need to add or change to reach your desired level of taste.",
