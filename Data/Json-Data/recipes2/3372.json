This is bursting with berry flavor so you don't even know there are green (gasp) veggies in it! The cocoa powder is not so detectable. I would suggest the maple syrup can be passed - the smoothie will get sweetness from the berries anyways. I've added this to my recipe box and will remake it but for my own preference will be using reduced calorie/sugar apple juice and will omit the maple syrup...possibly replace it with agave syrup. Thanks for posting!",
