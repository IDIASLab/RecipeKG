The flavor is quite mild and pleasant, and the texture is somewhat similar to mashed potatoes. This simple puree is a very versatile side dish, but the tasty root will also work sliced thin and layered in a gratin, either with or without potatoes. I hope you give this great fall and winter vegetable a try soon.",

We'll let me tell you it's better than mashed potatoes...I'm not kidding. I did only use a couple teaspoons of lemon juice to cook, did not add later. Did not use the salt to boiling, but used a teaspoon when celery root was in the Vitamix. Used 1/2 and 1/2 and the butter. If you have a Vitamix you can skip the straining at the end. CREAMY! SMOOTH!! INCREDIBLY TASTY!!!! Chef John did it again...with such a basic recipe.",
