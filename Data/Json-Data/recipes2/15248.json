On our ladies weekends at the beach the standard request is that I double or triple the recipe in order for enough to go around. We like it best served with hot fresh french bread or baquettes. Once I went to make it thinking I had the recipe memorized--but indeed I didn't and accidently increased the garlic and peppers to 1 TB each and everyone seemed to like it better so I stuck with it. I also substitute light mayo and sour cream--no one notices! This is a staple in our house and among our friends. If you're looking for something quick and simple give this is a try. Despite some of the negative reviews on here this recipe has been nothing but a success for me!",
