                "reviewBody": "The produce guy at the grocery store told me yes, $5.99 a pound for asparagus is pricey, but this is some darned good asparagus \u2013 it came all the way from Washington State!  (I\u2019m in Wisconsin).  I bought it, not because I felt it was extraordinary asparagus, but because I had planned it for dinner that night.  As it pertains to this recipe, now get this \u2013 I had the second half of the bunch standing in a glass of water in the fridge \u2013 for well over a week!  Believe it or not it was as though it had just been picked so it was just fine for our supper tonight.  Anyway, one of the things I liked about this recipe was that it called for the asparagus to be cut into pieces!  Every piece, every nook and cranny, gets a good coating of all the good stuff you\u2019re dousing it with, for one thing.  Also, it is a heckuva lot easier to eat!  No messing with cutting it with a knife and fork!  And it sure looked awfully pretty piled onto the plate.   Now whether it was the $5.99 a pound expensive asparagus direct from Washington State, this recipe, or a combination of both, this was some GOOD asparagus!  Cooked just right, by the way, at 12 minutes.  Happy to be the first reviewer and rate this an enthusiastic two thumbs up.",
