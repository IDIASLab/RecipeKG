I will say when I first made the milk mixture it did not thicken like macaroni and cheese I have made in the past and seemed very soupy. Even when I poured the mixture into my baking dish it was extremely watery and I thought there was no way it would set-up. Surprisingly it did set-up like typical macaroni & cheese. I let it rest about 10 minutes after I took it out of the oven and it was just fine. Don't be discouraged if your if mixture is very thin when you put it in the oven. It will be fine! That being said we weren't fans of the flavor. The jalapeno taste was there which we liked but it wasn't spicy. It seemed a little bland to us though and had more of a milky taste instead of a cheesy taste. I also didn't like the texture. I am not sure if that is from the type of cheese used or from the use of the egg yolks but it seemed almost grainy.",
