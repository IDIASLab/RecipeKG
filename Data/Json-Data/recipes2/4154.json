I like how I enhanced it: two chicken breasts, which I simmered in about 5 c. water for a half-hour.  Removing them to dice them up, I added about 1 T of minced garlic, a few handfulls of angelhair pasta, a few large pinches of dried parsley, and a few large pinches of oregano. I added the recommended Mrs. Dash's, which gave it a lot more zip. I also grated some mini-carrots (about 8), and let them simmer with the broth for about 10 min., before I added the diced-up chicken.  Salt and pepper to taste.  It was really yummy, and became 5-star!",

I used leftover turkey for the meat, an bow tie pasta since that is what I had on hand, 1/2 cup did not seem like enough so I bumped to 1 cup. I seasoned with a little salt & lots of pepper also added some fresh flat leaf parsley since I had some. OH! I did add two 1/4 teaspoons of garlic powder since I didn't have any garlic cloves. 1/4 tsp of garlic powder is the equivalent to one garlic clove. Just thought I would throw that little tip out there. This soup is a must try. I will be making this again and next time I think I will even add in some frozen green peas.",

In addition to the garlix and corn I also added an extra 4-cups of Chicken Broth to ensure \"soup\" consistency. Used large egg noodles and felt that if I hadn't added the extra 4-cups would have been more of a chicken noodle stew. Will definitely make this again. Is already a hit with the family.",
