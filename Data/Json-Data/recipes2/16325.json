It was good with prosucitto and brie, but next time I will use thicker ham and swiss cheese (plus pound out the chicken just a little).  The first couple I made, I didn't seal quite good enough, so most of the cheese came out, my last couple were nicely sealed tho.  Beautiful presentation!\r\n\r\nTo help a litle with the fat content I poached the chicken instead of frying it.  For 4 breasts I boiled 4 cups of water and a cup of wine, with some herbs, carrots, onions and celery for about 6 minutes, then let it stand covered for about 20.  The chicken was so tender and flavorful, plus I had a great chicken stock for later.",

I sauted the chicken with some butter olive oil garlic italian seasonings and salt and pepper. It definitely made the dish to have that flavor added. This was seriously one of those dishes that you bite into and freak out about how good it tastes! PERFECT!
