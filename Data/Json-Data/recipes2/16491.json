I just used smoked salmon bought from the store the type you put on bagels with cream cheese and it turned out wonderful!!! The nutmeg added such an interesting dimension to the taste you really shouldn't skip it! Plus the contrast of the blue pasta (thanks to the caviar) and the pink salmon was so much fun! And did I mention this was a snap to make? Wonderful wonderful recipe.",
