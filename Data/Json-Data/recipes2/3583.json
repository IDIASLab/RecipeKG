I could not manage to pound my chicken to 1/4 inch (and I was beginning to think the neighbors might be wondering WHAT was going on over here) so I slit the pieces and stuffed the slit meat pinning with toothpicks and proceeding as instructions indicated. Had to substitute craisins for the apricots this time but this worked well with the apple flavor. (Oooh wonder what dried mangoes might be like!) Also we are not the brave souls we once were so reduced the cayenne by half with no ill effect. Truly beautiful fairly simple (if you work around the 1/4 inch thing) and very very tasty.

My only complaint is that the pistachios were not listed in the ingredients when I first tried this - so I guessed and just threw in a handful of them. I used 1/2 cinnamon and 1/2 nutmeg in lieu of the full amount of mace. I also subbed dried figs for dates. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. It makes a great deal of filling FYI - we probably only used 2/3 of it. A fun different recipe that looks and smells delicious. Thanks Jacki!",

A lot of work to prepare; I thought the cardamom was a little overpowering and the cayenne somewhat distracting i'd cut that in half next time although usually the spicier the better for me. I felt it was missing something and that another spice might have been an appropriate addition but couldn't quite put my finger on it... definitely needed more apricots and more than the 1/2 cup of pistachios I put in since it wasn't specified in the recipe. I'd use at least a cup.",
