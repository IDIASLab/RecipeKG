So honored haha.\nThe only different things I did were, instead of leaving the turkey out for one hour I left it out for one and a half hours because I was using the oven for a pie. And also I didn't use the creme fraiche, I just used sour cream. Delicious",

We skipped the jalapenos and creme fresh due to dietary restrictions. Despite altering the recipe the result was incredible. The rich deep smoky flavor was a welcome change to orange garlic or sweet BBQ chicken options. The fresh herbs used at the end were a great fresh finish. We all sat around after dinner just picking more meat off the bone because we couldn't stop ourselves. This will be part of my permanent collection!",

                "reviewBody": "Helllooo cumin!! Wowza! The cumin completely overtook the entire thing. Next time I will just use a pinch. I tested this out on a 5lb whole chicken to make sure it is something we could use for Thanksgiving and boy I'm glad I did. With some tweaks I think it would be passable but the way it is in the recipe is not so good. Cut wayyy down on the cumin add some heat like red chili flakes and maybe a tad more soy sauce. I didn't make the 'gravy' and the skin (crust) was not crispy at all. In all fairness I think it's because my oven isn't the greatest and also because I had to adjust the time and temperature to cater to a chicken rather than a big turkey. I'll give it another shot but I'm glad I tried this out before Turkey Day! UPDATE I changed this from 3 stars down to 2 because the leftovers (which were a lot) were terrible. Something happened in the fridge over night and the spices completely changed their flavor. The cumin was still way too overpowering and the others turned grainy and very off-tasting. Most of Chef John's recipes are a hit but this one was definitely a miss.",
