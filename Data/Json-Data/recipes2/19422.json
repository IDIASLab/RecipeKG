I used chocolate wafer cookies and chocolate chip cookies and made some with vanilla ice cream and some with chocolate ice cream. When it comes to rolling the ice cream sandwiches I used all kinds of stuff: mini chocolate chips mini M&M's toffee pieces toasted coconut choppped peanuts crushed Oreos....etc. These definitely are a hit and a really cool and tasty treat!

I use these thin flat chocolate wafers and spread with home made whipped cream (whip a pint of heavy cream with 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tsp vanilla until very stiff.) Then spread a little on an oblong plate; spread some of the whipped cream on each cookie and (after you have a few together) stand VERTICALLY on the plate. After the whole box of cookies is done frost the entire \"log\" with the remaining whipped cream. Cover and refrigerate several hours. After a couple of hours in the 'fridge the crisp cookies will absorb moisture from the whipped cream and become cake-like. Slice the \"log\" on the diagonal for a REALLY tasty chocolate/cream dessert. I find this less messy but just as good as the ice cream version!",
