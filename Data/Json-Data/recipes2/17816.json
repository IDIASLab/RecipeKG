Easy to mix up and the texture was just perfect. They're not too sticky and would be the perfect snack to have in the car for a road trip. The cranberries give you a little zing of tartness and there's just a hint of the peanut butter flavor. I think the next time I'll use both cranberries and apricots and maybe add a little more peanut butter. Nice recipe to \"make your own\" by varying the nuts and dried fruits. This one is going into my \"Favorites\" file. Thanks JOENAUJOKAS for sharing your recipe.",
