Once I ran it through a well-greased food processor, though, it worked perfectly. Most other energy bites I've made called for this step, so I was surprised this one didn't. The flavor is great. Just the right amount of cinnamon and I couldn't even taste the carrots which was perfect for me since I don't care for them. This recipe would lend itself to modifications well, since the flavors are relatively neutral. I might add chia seeds and play with the spices next time.",

If the ingredients don't want to stick together add a tablespoon of agave nectar or honey and be sure to really smash everything together when forming the balls.
