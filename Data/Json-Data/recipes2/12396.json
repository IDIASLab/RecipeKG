I didn't add anything at to the first can, but the second has just come out of the slow cooker, and I'll try adding some sea salt and vanilla to it. I'm using it in coffee, and I find it blends more easily if I heat the caramel in the microwave first. It's quite thick, and I'm thinking it will work splendidly on top of a cheesecake.\n\nEdit: The first can I cooked according to this recipe, while for the second I tried 8 hours on low. I don't care for the flavor of that one at all, leaves a funny aftertaste. I'll stick to the faster cooking on high in the future. Also, I swirled some into my cheesecake batter before baking, and it produced a very tasty cheesecake.",

You do have to stir it all together in a separate bowl quite a bit becuase the consistency is jelly like on top and thicker at the bottom of the can. Keep stirring until it is nice and smooth. YUM!",

I don't know if it was just my crock pot or maybe I had too much water but it didn't even start simmering until the last hour and came out a little light and thin for what I wanted so I think I'll try a little longer than 4 1/2 hours next time.",
