DO NOT PRICK THEM.. that lets all the juices run out and results in a dry sausage. you dont want a dry sausage do you??? you WANT moist juicy sausage when you bite into it right? I serve that over mashed potatoes made just the way i like it and MAN!! is it good. all my friends BEG me to make this for them whenever i make south african/british comfort food for them...",
