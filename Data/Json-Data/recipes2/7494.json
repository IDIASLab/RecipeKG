For me the syrup was an interesting change because I usually do add a touch of brown sugar.  I was thinking that maybe just a dash of salt for the quick cooking oats could have heightened the flavor.  It does thicken as it stands for a few minutes, but we (my granddaughter and I) do prefer the thicker version.  She will be trying it in the morning, and if needed I will update this review.  Thanks, Deborah J Bell!",
