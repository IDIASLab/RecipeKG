I also used the bulk spring salad greens as well as some romain hearts. Then I made a simple salad dressing of a very aged balsamic vinegar (which has an amazing sweet flavour) and a gourmet orange olive oil salt and pepper and that made the salad perfect. I recommend you use a high quality vinaigrette or high quality ingredients to make your own. Be careful not to burn your pecans when you toast them in the cast iron pan!",
