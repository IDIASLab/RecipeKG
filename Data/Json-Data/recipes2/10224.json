I drink 16oz with 1tsp matcha powder and it s better than the Starbucks version. After a while Soy leaves me feeling less than great so I use rice milk or Ripple milk. Rice milk is a little thin. For unsweetened dairy free milk I use less than a 1/4oz honey by weight. I warm it gently on the stove and once the milk is the temp I want to drink I whisk the matcha in. A really good quality matcha powder won t clump. I use Akira Matcha from Amazon. I usually also use a dash of Vanilla extract. You could also sweeten it with raspberry simple syrup - it s a really unique treat. I do that once on a while.",
