I did not realize that we had no bacon. I used real bacon bits and just added it to the burger mix. I used Dave's BBQ Sauce from this site because I was out too. I dont have a grill I did these in my \"iron skillet\". I also put the slice of pineapple in the skillet just to heat and warm that was the only thing I did not think would be good was the cold pineapple on the burger. You want to crip your bun. I used homemade hamburger buns from this site too.. When you make these the meal is \"all about the BURGER\"... Thank you for the recipe.. great job.",

I didn't have hawaiian barbecue sauce so I used original jack daniels bbq sauce mixed with some pineapple juice from the canned pineapple slices (I used the directed amount in the burger and set some aside for the buns). We use microwavable bacon so I cooked the burgers with the bacon in the pan next to the burgers then topped the burgers with the bacon and cheese. These burgers have it all the juiciness crunchiness sweet and salty a great burger and a must try!",
