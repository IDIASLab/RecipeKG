I think that cooking the corn in the husk adds even more flavor to the corn. Also, if you are using already husked corn on the cob, all you have to do is to wrap the ears of corn individually with dampened paper towels and microwave as directed. With my microwave, 1 large ear of corn only needs to cook 3 minutes. When first starting to cook the corn this way, start with a shortened cooking time and then cook longer if need be. You can always  cook it a little longer if needed but I haven't figured yet how to UNCOOK anything.",
