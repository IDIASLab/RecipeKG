Excellent recipe for those who have an acquired taste for cooking with wine.

First never use commercial cooking wine - ever! It's the poorest quality you can buy. Instead opt for a good quality dry wine (either red or white) you would enjoy drinking tableside. The better the ingredients the better the outcome. Second I suggest sauteing seasoned chicken cutlets in a tablespoon or two of olive oil or the artichokes marinade until evenly browned. Then toss in some onion and garlic along with fresh sliced mushrooms and cook until soft. Next deglaze the pan with the wine and reduce a bit to cook off the alcohol and thicken the sauce. Then add the artichoke hearts (quartered or roughly chopped) simmer until heated through and the flavors marry. Finally season to taste with salt pepper and a little fresh minced thyme and/or parsley. Done in under a half hour and much more magical than dried out baked chicken.",

If you use the marinated kind, and the red wine, it will have seasoning and oil (from the artichoke hearts) and won't be overpoweringly \"alcohol-flavored\" as it would be if you used sherry instead of the red wine called for.
