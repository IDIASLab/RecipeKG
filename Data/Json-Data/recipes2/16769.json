I made the meat filling as the recipe stated, but found it incredibly bland and watery. I added onion powder, lots of ground black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and some Bisto gravy granules. This improved it, but I wish I had added some peas or green beans. Thanks anyway.",

Nuff said. I'm just rating this on the basis of the recipe. It needs peas and carrots big time and I'd leave out the part with the flour margarine ketchup consomme and especially the browning sauce you shouldn't need it. Use the consomme (or beef stock) by all means and a touch of flour to thicken but I normally simmer everything until the sauce thickens it's very important not to have too much moisture in the filling as it'll rise to the top while cooking and ruin the mashed spuds. Use a bit of tomato puree and some herbs if you're feeling adventurous I use thyme rosemary and parsley but they aren't everyone's cup of tea so use accordingly and don't forget the Worcester sauce (ONLY from Lea and Perrins!!!) and a teaspoonful of COLEMAN'S!!! powdered mustard in the sauce now you're cooking!",
