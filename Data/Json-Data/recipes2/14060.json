Although some previous reviews suggested to double the sauce because there isn't enough I found that I would actually need to thicken it with some cornstarch and parmesean cheese because it was too watery (this may have also been because I dumped the wine saute into the pasta when all the meats and veggies were done cooking?). Oh well I guess it depends on your personal preferences. I also added 1/4 cup of chopped green and red bell peppers and 1/4 cup fresh sliced mushrooms about 1-2 minutes before the chicken was done. Mmmm good. My daughter who is 5 years old had THREE helpings. Two thumbs up LT! Thank you for sharing this recipe.",

When reheating the sauce in the now deglazed pan I added 1 1/2 cups shredded parmesan cheese which added alot of flavor and texture.",

Just one note if you like to soak the sauce up with bread as my husband does the amounts called for in this recipe aren't enough. It just barely coats the pasta. I doubled the cream sauce and it made the perfect amount. This one will go in my permanent file!!",

I used fat free Land O' Lakes half & half instead of the heavy whipping cream which made it thinner (added a little bit of cornstarch as previous suggested). I also cooked the chicken in the olive oil before adding the wine (Pink Catawba was all I had). Didn't bother cooking the shrimp separately since I used a bag of cocktail shrimp instead; I just threw in the de-tailed shrimp 4 oz mushrooms and 1 1/2 cup broccoli with the chicken. (Next time I'll use a full 8 oz of mushrooms and 2-3 cups of broccoli.) And I used farfalle since I'm not a huge fan of long stringy pastas. Added parmesean to the mix--yummy! I'm sending this one to my mom! (My colleagues all looked jealous of my lunch today.)",

I started off by sauteeing the cut up chicken and garlic in some olive oil; meanwhile in a separate pot I made a roux out of flour and butter. I added the milk and cream (I wanted to use chicken stock in place of the milk but I was out). Once the chicken was nearly done I deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup of wine and then added the shrimp. Once the shrimp was cooked I added a big splash of wine and the white sauce which I'd also added the seasoning to. We served this over pasta and the end result was a \"ok\" but not the quality that we're used to eating we found it bland and boring. I advise finding a different recipe if you want a chicken/shrimp pasta dish.",
