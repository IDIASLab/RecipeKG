The result was outstanding and a bit of extra chili powder made all the difference. Served with warm corn chips.

I've added salsa to the chili blended with a stick blender before adding the chili/salsa to the cheese. A pinch of chili powder isn't enough. If you like it hot you'll need at least 2 teaspoons maybe more. This recipe is so easy to tweak to personal tastes there's no reason not to try it. It's pretty much impossible to screw it up.
