I\u2019ve never bought a rotisserie chicken and probably never will.  It seems far easier to me to just cook a boneless/skinless chicken breast in my Instant Pot\u00ae, shred the meat, and add the broth left from cooking to the chicken stock.

I realized after I started making the recipes that it wasn't 4 cups of water but actually 16 cups (4 quarts). When I got to the liquid part I added 8 cups, what I could fit in my 3\" tall pot, and then 4 more cups right before it was finished. For the amount of noodles and chicken, I used, it seemed fine. I cooked the onions until almost soft and then saut\u00e9ed the carrots and celery with it for a few minutes, too, before adding the liquid. When I added the first 8 cups of water I did 2 Tblsp plus 2 tsp of low-sodium vegetable paste. I didn't have chicken broth and wanted to use less sodium anyhow. I find bay leaf to be strong in flavor, so I just used 1 leaf instead of 2. I didn't have a sprig of time, so I used 1/4 tsp. dried. Other seasonings I added were a pinch of pepper, garlic salt, and dried parsley at the end. For the meat I just did 2 cups of rotisserie and pretty much all white meat. I weighed the regular egg noodles, I had leftover from another recipe, and it was 5 oz or 2 3/4 cup and that also worked good. I also simmered it a little longer than suggested to ensure the vegetables were soft and to have it warm for dinner. I would make this again. I got about 7 servings, and made as is, at 187 calories per bowl. ty",

Totally simple for an on the go family that doesn't have time to roast their own rotisserie chicken and/or cook a chicken and make fresh stock with herbs and spices. It's what I normally do for my family. This recipe totally cuts down the prep. While the recipe was so simple I felt it lacked in the flavor department just a tad. So I added additional dried herbs to bring out the broth flavor more. About 1 tsp of Italian Seasoning and that did it total justice. The best part of the recipe was the noodles I've used the No Yolks before and they never stick to each other and the never get gummy the next day or soak up the broth in make you add more. Love the fact I can over cook them and the noodles get super large and still retain perfectness. TY pretty good in my books.",

It needs more vegetables for my taste and we only got two bowls of soup before ending up with next to no broth. Either the noodles kept soaking it up or it doesn't call for enough broth. This happens when I use pasta but from the reviews I thought these noodles would be different. They have a good texture so I'd use them again but I guess I'll go back to cooking my noodles separately.",
