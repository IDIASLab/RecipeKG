I have always had a phobia of using uncooked, fresh tomatoes in a sauce but I've been converted!  lol  My husband loves red onions and Italian dressing so I decided to give this recipe a try. I used four beefsteak tomatoes (my plum romas were not ripe yet) that I picked from my garden and I seeded and diced them.  Then I picked a big handful of basil and chopped that up.  I added 1/2 cup of Good Seasons Salad dsg ( that I had made with balsamic vinegar...I noted that alot of recipes for fresh tomato sauce add balsamic vinegar so that is how I incorporated it into this one). Finally, I used angel hair because that is what I had.  It is just an explosion of freshness and summer in your mouth when you eat this.  I highly recommend!",

I tossed it all together with the other ingredient's while in the hot pan and served it warm. The olive oil that it was used to cook the veggies really added to it. It was so good.

I skipped the onion because my family doesn't care for it.  I added more grated parm than called for in the recipe.  Even my picky 8 year old liked this, and my 12 year old said it was a keeper!

It's easy to make and a great way to use basil and tomatoes from a garden. I used an Italian dressing mix and just threw all the ingredients together in the bowl rather than mixing it separately so I wound up using more dressing than the recipe called for but it's good that way. I made the dressing with balsamic vinegar and olive oil (I'll probably reduce the oil next time to make it healthier). After tasting the salad I added extra onion which I feel was an improvement. I think it would also benefit from more basil and maybe some garlic as suggested by other reviewers.",
