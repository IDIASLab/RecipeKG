Red peppers make it pretty and one or two other vegetables, fruits or nuts keep it changing and interesting. I developed this recipe after I tasted cream cheese in a salmon salad sandwich at a funeral lunch in Canada many years ago. Add baby spinach or lettuce leaves, and serve on your favorite bread or as a wrap in a tortilla.",

I did miss, however, some of the tang  and flavor more mayonnaise would have given it but a squeeze of lemon and some minced red onion fixed that right up.  LOVED the red bell pepper here!  I would never have thought to add that to tuna salad and it made a difference -  in a good way.  I didn't have carrots on hand and I'm not sure I would have liked them anyway  (simply because I don't like carrots in the first place except in cake) and I found celery was the substitute that worked for me.",

I have a manual shredder that sort of looks like a potato peeler. That was way faster than small chopping carrot. It makes it a good size too. I realized I didn't have red pepper only green. So, I used the green one, but only did 2 Tblsp. minced. Lastly, I chose this recipe to use up an equal amount of canned white chicken meat. I used whipped cream cheese. It is lower in calories and stirs into things more easily and regular mayo. Recalculating the calories, and actual servings, it ended up as 175 cal. for 3 good sized servings. That didn't include a tomato, for stuffing, bread, or anything else. That was just for the filling. I would make this again, if for the way it held together when scooped.",
