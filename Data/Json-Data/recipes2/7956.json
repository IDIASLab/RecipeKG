After a few tries, I've modified the following: I use half a container of greek yogurt instead of measuring a half cup. I use 1% milk instead of almond milk. I really want grab & go, so I added the fruit when I made it, not the next morning. Sliced bananas and frozen strawberries are a winner. Frozen blueberries didn't translate. I make them two at a time and so far the jar that sat an extra day was better. I might try extending the times to see if I could make four in a batch.",
