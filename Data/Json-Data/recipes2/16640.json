I only changed a few things about this recipe: 1) I used a gourmet garlic-infused extra virgin olive oil instead of grilling the garlic in oil.  2) Also 6 tablespoons seems a bit much...that's more than 1/3 cup of oil for pasta for 2 people.  I reduced to 4 tablespoons (or 1/4 cup) for the amount of pasta suggested and it came out great.  3) I added the drained pasta directly to the sauting shrimp in the large skillet.  (You have to have a very large skillet...which I did.)  And 4) You should taste the pasta after you mixed it with the oil.  I found that I needed to add a little bit (1 teaspoon or so) of garlic salt to kick up the flavor.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!",

I made the sauce with 8 tbsp EVOO, half a stick of butter, juice of 2 lemons, 4 cloves garlic minced, and 1 tsp crushed red pepper.  I added about 1 1/2 lbs pre-cooked frozen shrimp to the sauce.  but I forgot the parsley! so I am giving this 4 stars because I changed it alot.  \n\nThanks so much for the recipie idea it was simple and tasty",
