I had a favorite recipe that I had been making but was looking for something new to try. This sounded good and I was right! The only small changes I made were to use less red onion (at most 1 tsp) and more dressing (about 1 tbsp). I've eaten this for lunch 2 days in a row stuffed in avocado halves. AMAZING! I'll be making this often!",
