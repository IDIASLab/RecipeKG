The little ones at first were wary but even the littlest one who detests mushrooms ate it up and asked for seconds! The changes I made were I used cream of chicken and for the cheese I chopped up colby muenster provolone and cheddar (remnants of sandwich stuff) and for the top I chopped and mixed a few jalapenos in with chili powder and paprika. Will probably use black olives with the mushrooms next time. Wonderful!",
