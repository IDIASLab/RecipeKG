This makes the toast extra crunchy and never soggy. It's delicious when done this way. Also, I make a quick Strawberry sauce to go over it. The pastry brush really brings out the true flavors esp.the butter. Try it and see. ?????",

I was able to get 2 extra slices out of the mixture.It says to cook over medium heat but 5 minutes on medium heat is way too long; my bread was burning at 3 minutes. I turned it over and did that side about 3 minutes and it was super soggy. For the next 2 I turned the heat down to medium low and cooked each side 4-5 minutes. Once I got the temp and cooking time down it was much better but it is still a bit soggy in the middle more so than with egg. Maybe a bit of flour added in with the milk would help. I made a slice with whole wheat bread and gave to my preschooler and she liked it a lot.",

It reminded me of the inside of a cinnamon roll. It is quite hard to flip though and does stick to the pan even with a significant amount of better. I should also add I non dairy milk which may have made it mushier.",
