So many people said it lacked flavor that I made some small additions.  I added 1 clove of minced garlic, 1 tsp of garlic salt and 1 tsp of cajun seasoning.  It's fantastic and tastes just like pasta I've had at some restaurants.   Try it!  The additional salt in the garlic salt and the kick from the cajun seasoning are really good. ",

It is not a spicy dish and really doesn't have \"kick\" more like a comfort food. So if you are looking for something with \"bite\" this isn't it it's more of an alfredo type dish. One thing I may do if I make it again is use like a chive flavored cream cheese or vegetable flavored or something. That sounds really good. Oh I added fresh mushrooms that I sauteed a little with the green onions because my son loves mushrooms (anything to get veggies in the little guy)!! Thank you for the recipe!",
