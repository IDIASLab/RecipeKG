Makes the perfect after-dinner dessert. So many possible variations using different flavors of ice cream and cold brew. I used vanilla bean Halo Top (for a healthier low-carb and low-sugar option) and plain House Blend Gevalia cold brew. The following night I used chocolate Halo Top. Delicious! I can also see adding in a bit of liqueur of your choice. -- This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.",
