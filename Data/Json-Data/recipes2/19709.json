        "description": "A wonderful appetizer to enjoy with friends when San Francisco's Indian summer warms the city. The true way to 'cook' the fish is to marinate it in citrus juice overnight, but I find that the poaching process is faster and an easy way to judge if it is indeed cooked. I often buy precooked shrimp (but NOT frozen!) and just poach the scallops. Best when served with cold beer (we prefer Pacifico&reg;) and fresh limes. Using quality and sturdy tortilla chips is essential. Please note that the serving size is meant for appetizer portions.",

                "reviewBody": "I tried this ceviche because there was an addition of red and yellow peppers which I had on hand. I really liked the addition of the peppers- it gives an extra crunch and color. This is first time that I've seen a ceviche recipe where it calls for poaching the scallops first so I decided to give it a try. This method particularly is good if you want this dish right away but I am fine either way (marinating the fish in lime juice for a while so the flavor can be enhanced by the lime & orange juice). I ended up using pre-cooked fresh not frozen tiny shrimp which worked well and aided in the quickness of the recipe. Overall great appetizer to share with friends or inhale on my own with a side of tortilla chips!",
