If you wanted more garlic flavor you could add garlic powder instead of all that salt. Also I think the garlic salt would have been best mixed in with the cream cheese/sour cream. The recipe states that the picante sauce is to be divided but doesn't state two places to use it in the recipe so I put it all in the layer that was mentioned. I only used 1/2 an onion and that was plenty oniony for me. This was fine if you have minimal ingredients but I like the layered dip recipes that call for taco seasoning in the sour cream mixture.",
