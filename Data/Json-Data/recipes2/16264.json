We were both very skeptical of this recipe but it was very good. I served it in martini glasses garnished w/ a couple of ruffly lettuce leaves & wafer crackers shaped like butterflies. Heated up the leftovers the next night by moistening it all w/ a tad more melted butter & wine & then nuking it for a minute. Wsa just as good as the night before! Thansk for the recipe Michelle Long...we enjoyed it!",
