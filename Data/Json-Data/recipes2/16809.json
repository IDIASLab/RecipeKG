Hers was similar but better I think. She used the ground beef onion and green pepper sauteed together. In a separate pan she fixed a \"boxed\" macaroni and cheese mix. After the meat was browned she drained it and added the mac-n-chz with a can of tomatoes and a dash of salt pepper and garlic salt or any other similar spice you want. Hers was a one dish meal served with a tossed salad and crusty bread. SO good! And easy to warm up leftovers - if you have any!",

I served it over brown rice and added greek yogurt on top in place of sour cream. My fiance was scared to try it (I think the name \"goulash\" was the main problem:) and he really liked it... he finished off his serving!
