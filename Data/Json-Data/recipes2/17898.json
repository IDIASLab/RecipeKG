I could've smoked it on the grill but chose to cook it like I always do whole chickens on the Traeger....45 minutes on High 45 minutes on Smoke but added 10 more minutes or so on the Smoke setting. One of the best chickens I've ever cooked but you gotta like the citrus flavor. I imagine the flavor on mine was more subtle than if I'd smoked it for 10 hours like the author did. Very fine recipe and very easy.",

I was afraid the lemon lime soda was going to make these sweet but that was not at all the case. What the soda did was make those little birds tender like no other. I have never had such tender meat come out of a smoker before. I am guilty of rubbing some seasoning on the outside of the birds for flavor because I feel that is necessary but the seasoning played no part to the tenderness. That would be the lemon lime soda. Very impressive!",
