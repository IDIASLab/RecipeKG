Used chicken breasts and boiled them alone. Used italian sausage baking it in the oven at 325 degrees for about 45 minutes. Did cook the chicken and sausage the day before and refrigerated as suggested. Added 1/2 pound of fresh pre-cooked shrimp with the meat. Flavor is mild enough that there is a kick but won't send you running for the water. If you like your food hot I would add more spices.",

I had only tomato sauce rather than paste and it worked out just fine. I also used about a cup and a half of rice and increased the stock accordingly. I don't think you can mess this one up - just stick with the basic recipe and add or delete spices as you like. I added salt and pepper and a few shakes of creole seasoning. I'll be making this again for sure. Thanks for the recipe!",
