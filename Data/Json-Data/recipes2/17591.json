And instead of forming them into egg shapes I cheated and bought a silicone cupcake pan and just coated the insides with chocolate up the rim. Then I set them in the freezer until hardened (about 5 minutes) filled up the molds with the filling about 7/8 full and sealed them in with melted chocolate. I gave them to some family and neighbors and they thought they were store bought! PERFECT!!! Next time I'll get some white chocolate and color it with Easter colors and hand paint the designs on them. I did one batch with 1 1/2 tsp. of peppermint extract and it tasted just like a peppermint patty only better! The peanut butter ones were the favorite of everyone (because my family is peanut butter lovers. I did have a problem with the first batch of peanut butter being a little to dry so the next batch I just added a Tablespoon at a time of milk and it made them perfect! And the third batch I did with maraschino cherries chopped up and a little cherry extract. Those were the favorites of everyone that I had to stash some for myself and the husband! They were superb! Thank you kindly for such a fantastic recipe! My kids have LOVED helping me make these not to mention they gobble them down before they even hit the fridge!",

Next time I'll play around with some other flavors which is really the best part of this recipe. There are so many differnt combinations you could do. Will definitely make again. I did use a dipping chocolate over the chocolate chips though--works better and you don't have to worry about tempering the chocolate & it maybe getting bloom. A mini crockpot works great for this--put chocolate in let it sit stirring every so often so it doesn't burn on sides when almost melted unplug it & the chocolate will finish melting & stay melted for a long time. I made smaller eggs so that they were easier to dip-if prefer larger eggs then you'll have to use two forks. I used different colored chocolates to decorate the outside like an Easter egg & to tell them apart. Also used different chocolates to dip-did chocolate egg in white chocolate did peanut butter in dark chocolate & cream in dark chocolate. I didn't do the coconut because I was also serving macaroons so was worried about having too much.",

Next time I'll start with 1/4 cup and try that. I had to make another batch of eggs to add dough to the chocolate section and I threw out much of the original chocolate mix. The overall recipe is a good one. I made miniature eggs and they worked out great. The chocolate eggs turned out very like rich dark chocolate truffles which I covered in white chocolate. All of the eggs are getting rave reviews. Variations I'll try next year: mix together chocolate dough and coconut dough and top with an almond; add raspberry extract in the chocolate eggs; orange for the vanilla dough; wrap vanilla dough on a maraschino cherry and dip etc. I used Guitard's chocolate but I recommend Wilton's as Guitard's is hard to work with. Mark cookie sheets or chocolates so you can identify them after dipping. Shape all of your eggs on waxpaper lined cookie sheets before starting dipping. Make a lot of room in fridge for chilling dough.",

My husband is allergic to coconut, so I did one part plain, one part peanut butter, one part Nutella (I used about 2/3 cup of the chocolate-hazelnut spread), and one part chocolate-orange (about \u00bd cup or so of cocoa and \u00bd tsp or so of orange extract, and then I mixed it in my hands to avoid crumbly batter). To make the egg-like shape, I rolled slightly-heaping teaspoonfuls of batter in my palms until it was like a ball and then I squished-and-rolled the ball slightly. Egg-like enough for me. :) I ended up with 61 'eggs'. I'm also using the chocolate melties for the coating. I'll add to my review after dipping, but the Nutella filling is AWESOME!!",

Combined 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa 1/4 cup hot chocolate mix and 1/4 cup chocolate milk powder for the chocolate ones which worked well. Just cocoa would have been dry/bitter. Eggs tasted very good and held together well but you have to keep them somewhere cool. Peanut butter was the best imo. You'll need more than 2 cups of chips to dip them all but they're fine undipped too.",
