I decided to do a little mash-up and this Irish pork stew with baby cabbage was the result. By the way, baby cabbage can be a little hard to find, but you can use Brussels sprouts, and no one will know the difference, mostly because there isn't one.",

It was FANTASTIC!  I had nearly 6 pounds of meat, and adjusted the recipe to suit.  We (okay, 'I') just finished the last of the stew a few moments ago.  My son even had it for breakfast after pulling an 'all nighter' for college.  I had to promise my family that I'll make it again very soon.  WELL WORTH MAKING.  I did read one review that gave this recipe a lower rating because it contained alcohol, which honestly doesn't make any sense to me.  If you don't like the alcohol, then use an alcohol free beer - don't give a wonderful recipe a bad rap.  Anyway - please try this recipe.  And definitely watch the video, too.  Enjoy! :-)",

But I love it wend someone do the recipe with alterations I too can't leave anything alone! I have to play with my food. You did adjusted it to your personal taste that what I like to see what others have did to any improvements and/or variations you make to this simple recipe. I use 3 pounds lamb shoulder chops a little extra garlic but otherwise made as-is. I did read one review that gave this recipe a lower rating because it contained alcohol You can substitute 1-1/2 cups chicken stock. YES I DO SEE this is on the radar too. Going to be tough to top this one though. I did adjusted to my personal taste. Your way is very delicious. The next time I did it and I add it to my recipe box and to My Note: My family loved bouth ways and I'll be making this a lot more. Both are delicious it's a matter of what your taste is....I now have two ways to this. YOU HAVE SUCCESS!! with me. Now I can do my happy food dance!! Thank you!!! Happy Cooking to you and y'all!
