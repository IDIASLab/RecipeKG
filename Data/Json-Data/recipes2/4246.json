Everyone liked it, thought it was really good for being so quick.  I didn't have the chicken broth, so I used chicken boullion, and it ended up a little salty, but I can't blame that on the recipe.  I actually \"fried\" it a little at the end by adding a little more oil, this seemed to take away the \"Minute Rice\" texture, and make it better.  I'd definitely use this recipe again when I'm pinched for time.",

I usually do not cook any vegetables in it though because I make chicken with broccoli when I serve this rice.  I cook exactly as stated, but at the end before I combine the egg, I add 1-2 minced garlic cloves (depending on size) and 3-4 tablespoons of Land O' Lakes Light Butter.  Once the butter melts throughout and egg is added, make sure it's well mixed.  Then, I just cap it for a few minutes on low to heat back up.  You can add some salt and pepper to taste as well, but you shouldn't need any more salt with the soy.  Let's just say it's the best stir-fried rice you'll ever eat!!!! Such a great foundation to complete my perfect stir-fried rice recipe!  Hope this helps and you enjoy!!",

I had to modify the rice- I had chicken flavor steam in the bag rice; so i used a 1/2 cup of water along with the soy sauce and steamed the rice in the pan.

After I mixed everything up at the end, I sauteed the whole mixture briefly on med-high heat in about 1-2 T of butter that had been sauteed with some more fresh ginger.  Delicious and tasted very fresh and healthy (although I'm sure it would have been healthier without the butter).",
