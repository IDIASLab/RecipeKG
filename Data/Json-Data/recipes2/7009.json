Literally meaning 'mixed rice,' it's a popular meal consisting of white rice topped with vegetables, beef, a whole egg, and gochujang (red chili pepper paste). For those who cannot handle the spiciness (like our children), you can substitute with soy sauce or Sriracha (rooster sauce) in place of it.",

If you are considering adding it to your dinner rotation, then I highly recommend taking a trip to your local Asian supermarket.  There you will find ingredients and tools to make this perfect every time.  At the Asian supermarket you should buy your gochujang, stone bowls, sticky rice, chili oil, and their thicker soy sauce made for soups.\n\nEverything is made up ahead of time.  I use:  bean sprouts, shredded carrot that I mix with the thicker soy sauce, chicken tossed in the same sauce, steamed and pressed spinach tossed in chili oil, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and an egg, but you can add different veggies if you prefer.  I put my stone bowls in a warm oven while I cook my sticky rice in my rice cooker.  The sticky rice gets really crunchy in the stone bowl and is well worth the effort.  Once it's done, I take the bowls out and place on a hot burner (be careful of heat because the bowl can crack).  I add the sticky rice to the bottom with chili oil and cook for five minutes.  Continue to stir so it doesn't burn and occasionally flick water into the bowl to get that crunch. When that is finished, I add the other ingredients around the bowl like a sliced pie would appear.  Lastly I cook the egg for the top, add salt and pepper to it and place it on top.  Undercook the egg as it will continue to cook in the very hot bowl.  I cut my gochujang with sesame oil to thin it out a bit.  This is a family favorite and healthy too.",
