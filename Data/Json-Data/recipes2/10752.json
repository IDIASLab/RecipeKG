I didn\u2019t have chipotle barbeque sauce but I did have chipotles.  Added chipotle peppers to the olive oil, lime  and salt drizzle. It was maybe a tablespoon, I didn\u2019t measure, just emptied the bottle. During grilling I brushed on sweet baby rays brown sugar and hickory barbeque sauce and the last couple of minutes of grilling I added the Monterey Jack cheese instead of at the beginning of grilling. ( The cheese always seemed to melt away when I put it on at the beginning). Anyway, it was really tasty. Thanks for the recipe.",

Right before I was going to grill, it started pouring outside so I baked the (full, not half) chicken breasts at 375 for about 15-20 minutes each side. (I missed the direction of halving the breasts and realized it right before baking time). Halving the breasts will cut the cooking time to the amount specified in this recipe making it simple to prepare and quick to cook. I can\u2019t wait to make this for my whole family on the grill. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!",
