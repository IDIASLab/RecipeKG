My suggestion on this is to have the peanut butter at room temperature before adding the honey and milk powder and then refrigerate it before making it into balls and rolling in the graham cracker crumbs.  I do prefer rolling my cracker crumbs from the crackers instead of buying the box of cracker crumbs--it just tastes better to me.  As with so many recipes where you roll something in crumbs, these didn't use all the crumbs called for, so you could go way short and then add as needed.  I refrigerated them afterwards to keep them firm enough to handle.  I did not use the raisins, but I could possibly try a little piece of banana in the middle of them next time, since the girls do like that combo.  These are something easy to make for a sweet but fairly healthy snack.  Thanks for the recipe!",

The mixture was a bit runny and didn't hold together well but I'm 99% certain that's because I used a organic natural peanut butter that needs to have the oil mixed in. That peanut butter seems more runny in general when compared to regular packaged peanut butter. It was a easy fix by adding a bit more powdered milk though. The next batch I made I cut back on the honey and everything turned out fine. The batch after that I added the recommended amount of honey and some chia seeds. The experimenting and customization will continue. Great recipe to get me started.",
