Living in Kentucky for many years, I have eaten this hundreds of times except cooked with ham hocks.  This time I didn't have any ham hocks (or other necks or parts on hand) and just added beef bullion instead to my water.  It gives it a 'meaty' flavor without any meat or parts.  I also add lots of chopped garlic (in place of powder) and several tsp. of Mrs. Dash salt-free seasoning.  I also added a can of dark red kidney beans, drained and rinsed, to make a complete meatless main dish with lots of protein and fiber.  I served it with some long grain and wild rice cooked with mushrooms, onion, and peas and called it a meal!  You can play around with this recipe a lot.  It's designed to be versatile, to fit many tastes.  ",
