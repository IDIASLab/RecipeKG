The sour cream makes all the difference in the world.  This has a delightful flavor and consistency.  I did reduce the sour cream by 1/2, as I was afraid of too much *tang* and I\"m glad I did.  It was perfect.  I chilled my bowl and beaters about 30 minutes before whipping.  THANKS for a great recipe!",

It was still stable in the morning and I ended up eating the rest for breakfast (no pie just the cream!). The first time I made this I did follow others suggestions and used 1/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup heavy cream. I upped the powdered sugar to 1/3 cup because some mentioned it wasn't very sweet. I usually don't modify recipes the first time I try them but I was feeding someone who typically doesn't care for sour cream and I was unsure how strong the original recipe would be. The second time I followed the recipe exactly (except for 1/3 cup powdered sugar not a major change) and it was still delicious with just a slight tang reminiscent of cheesecake. If you don't tell anyone there's sour cream in this I doubt anyone would ever guess. I never had a problem getting it to stiff peaks with a deep chilled bowl and whisk and my stand up mixer. It didn't take any longer to whip than just whipping cream would take. I can't wait to try this on apple pie.",
