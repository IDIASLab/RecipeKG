(Definitely wouldn't call it the healthiest meal.)\nI cut the recipe in half to suit the size of my household and omitted the bell pepper.\nI also diced the raw chicken and cooked it on the skillet instead of baking it. It's hot enough in SoCal without the oven going for an extra 30 minutes while prepping the rest of the ingredients.\nThis could just be a personal preference, but my only complaint with the recipe as written was the steps felt like they were painfully out of order for efficiency. I started cooking the pasta right away, then cooked the chicken. While the chicken was cooking, I cut my other ingredients (bacon, mushrooms) and had them ready to place on the skillet once the chicken was browned. Once the bacon was also cooked and the vegetables were on the skillet, THIS is when I preheated the oven and prepped the casserole. Following other reviews, I mixed everything together except for half the cheese and some bacon bits for the top. \nAll in all it's a wonderful recipe. Will DEFINITELY make again.",
