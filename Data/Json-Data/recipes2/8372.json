I liked how easy it was to make, that I had all the ingredients already on hand, and I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to cook it properly without burning it.   I made it specifically to go with yogurt and fruit and for that it was actually perfect.  When I ate it by itself, however, it was kind of bland.  So if I were to make it for snacking I'd probably add craisins and maybe some brown sugar or something else to sweeten it a little more.",

I knew i wanted to use up some shredded coconut and plenty on nuts and a few raisins and dried cherries. The recipe already included cinnamon and I added about 3/4 tsp Redmond salt to the liquids. I found the proportions to be very good liquid to dry. Since I had added 2-3 cups of coconut and 2 cups of walnuts and almonds both raw and chopped I doubled the honey oil mixture and baked as directed. It hasn't quite cooled yet but preliminary tasting tells be its not too sweet or oily and the fruit which i added to the warm granola after removing it from the oven has softened from the warmth. I think that the granola will be a bit less sticky when completely cooled but I did bake on two quarter sheet pans for an added 10 minutes. Now its just what I was looking for for a snack for the group going out tomorrow together after we talk to a few neighbors.",
