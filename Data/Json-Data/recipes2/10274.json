That said I am not the best cook in the world and making fabulous pancakes before switching to GF was no easy task for me. These were simple enough to make and I think wold have turned out even better if I had a nice griddle to cook them on instead of using the good ol' frying pan. I will be making these again in hopes of perfecting the art of pancake making! Another thing to be aware of is since this recipe has no flour in it the pancakes will be a way different texture than what you might be used to. I was told to cook them slowly or they get all weird.",

I made a couple of adjustments because my banana was a little bit small & the batter ended up way too watery.. So I added about 2 teaspoons of oats (which I blended in) and about 1/2 a teaspoon of xanthan gum (which is great for all kinds of things that need thickening. most people use it to thicken smoothies) and I just stirred that in and waited about 3 minutes. I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon and topped them with peanut butter & maple syrup. YUM! I will make these a lot!:) Thanks!",
