I cooked up some instant seasoned mashed potatoes, placed the potatoes in the bottom of a baking dish, topped the potatoes with the hamburger mixture and placed the biscuits on top and sprinkled the biscuits with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I baked it at 350 until the biscuits were golden brown. It was very tasty after these adjustments. Somehow the cream of chicken soup and ketchup didn't sound like a good combo.",

I sprinkled the top with shredded MJ and cheddar cheese and french fried onions. I think this was a winner! Totally easy and super adjustable!",
