I marinated the fajitas overnight and I think marinating them that long helped bring out all the flavor.  Those who like a lot of heat, can add the pico de gallo, jalape\u00f1os, etc.  For those that do not like a lot of heat, leave off the pico de gallo and add the toppings of your choice.  I really like that Goya Mojo Criollo marinade.  I did not find the Sazonador.  So I added garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, black pepper, and mexican oregano instead.  I seasoned the meat first with the marinade.  Then I cooked the meat first, removed the meat, added the vegetables to let them cook and get the flavor of the meat.  Then added the meat back at the end.  However, next time I would grill the meat instead.",
