Our other three kids didn't like the texture of the bananas in the pancakes; possibly due to the fact it was something new. The pancakes were too sweet for me to add syrup. But they were very yummy with a smattering of butter spread on top. Next time I make these I might mash the bananas and add less white chocolate chips. (oh I added a splash of sugar free hazelnut syrup to the batter for a nut flavoring with out the crunch because I have kids who hate nuts. But if I make this again and only for my husband and I I would add some kind of nut for a crunch contrast)",
