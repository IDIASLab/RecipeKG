I cut it down to 20 and they still came out hard although with the airbake pans they were okay. I'll take it to work for others to try but I don't think I'll try this again.",

These spread a lot while baking; use only a scant teaspoonful and only put about 12 cookies on a sheet. I alternated between parchment paper and a Silpat on my baking sheets. I found that 25-30 minutes is WAY TOO LONG to bake these. The cookies became far too dark and crisp. I baked them for about 12 minutes. Also you will want to definitely leave the cookies on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before attempting to remove them. I will be making these again they were a big hit!

Taste good but a real pain to scrape off the paper-lined sheets so I might make these again but not on a regular basis. N R",
