This helps the onions and squash caramelise beautifully.  I have also in the past roasted different vegetables to go on the pizza... things like new asparagus, cherry tomatoes, zucchini or eggplant.  Further to that after the vegetables are roasted I add Proscuitto to the pizza, as well as some goats cheese or feta (depending on what I have on hand)and a little parmesan or pecorino along with some mozzarella.  Serve with a simple green salad of baby spinach leaves with a balsamic vinegarette",

It's sweet, fragrant, and so good for you.  I used only a small amount of cheese (Monteray Jack & Parmasean).  I also carmelized the onions instead of putting them in the oven with the squash.  \nIt was someones GREAT suggestion that the butternut squash be boiled on the stove for 4 minutes in order to aid in peeling.

Instead of parm (which I will still try) I used a light (!! - too much would overpower the delicate squash flavor -!!) sprinkling of cheddar and blue cheese. WOW it kicked it up a notch. I made this with Trader Joe's whole wheat pizza crust which made 2 9in pizzas and in the last few minutes of baking I slid them off the tray and baked it right on the oven rack to get it nice and crispy. I also added some julienned bresaola - a cured italian meat like procuitto except made from beef and not pork. It added a nice bit of salt to the savory and went great with the blue cheese. Awesome.",
