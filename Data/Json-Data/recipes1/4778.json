I think the next time, if I ever make it again, I'll use my standard chicken coating method (dredge in flour, dip in egg/milk mixture and then coat in the bread crumb mixture, which, of course, would include the herbs and lemon and lime zest from the original recipe and then pour the mustard/lime juice in the baking pan. I think I'd keep the chicken pieces on a rack in the baking pan so they wouldn't get soggy.
