Next time I make this, I'd like to try this with some sliced sweet onion and fresh minced garlic. Then I think it would be perfect.",

I had to change it up because of what I had on hand. I substituted turkey bacon for the real thing cooked the romaine ( some kale) in olive oil instead of bacon grease and used rotini instead of shells. We also added some crushed red pepper which gave it some much needed liveliness. White wine would have really complimented it.",

                "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this quite a bit but since Heidikin's review concerning cooked lettuce really hit home with me (I've had braised lettuce before and just can't get into it) I changed the process slightly - I did not saute the lettuce in the pan but rather tossed the cooked pasta and tomatoes with the lettuce before topping with cheese and bacon. The result is lettuce that may be slightly wilted slightly warm but still cool and crisp in places. I would have used fresh romas if I had them but instead used a can of chopped tomatoes (drained) with garlic and basil. That added some flavor that I feel would have been necessary so if you are going to use fresh tomatoes I would recommend adding some fresh basil garlic maybe some crushed red pepper to the pan. I found the canned tomatoes even though I drained them added a bit more \"sauce\" which I really enjoyed. I ended up with a very flavorful dish and I'm pretty sure I'll be having it again many times but I know my tastes and will stick to not cooking the lettuce down. Thanks for sharing Monica! I like this one a lot!",
