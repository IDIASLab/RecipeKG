I browned the pork with salt and pepper. I added the meat to my six cups of chicken stock/water mix. I sauteed the onion (2 small ones), 2 carrots, tons of garlic, the red pepper, and jalape\u00f1o, cumin and cayenne in the oil from the pork. I added that to the broth. Then, I put in a tablespoon or so of honey! I put in the black eyed peas and cooked on high for one hour and then turned it down to low and cooked another 5 1/2 or so. The last hour, I added an entire bunch of coarsely chopped kale. Served it with cornbread and honey to top the cornbread. Normally, I like cornbread crumbled in my beans; however, this was such a good soup, I didn't want to change the flavor with the sweetness of the bread. So, I ate it on the side. Oh, this dish was heaven! I froze the leftovers for when our baby arrives in about 4 weeks.......but I really struggled with that! I wanted to eat it for lunch and dinner tomorrow!",

                "reviewBody": "I absolutely loved this meal.  At the start of the year I found out I have extremely high cholesterol and came seeking healthy foods.  I switched out the four strips of bacon for a couple of extra slices of lean ham (same weight but with the big clobs of fat) otherwise I left the recipe alone.  It deserves to be cooked slowly over 6-8 hours rather than being cooked on high.  Comments on the quantity of fluid seem overblown, probably because soaking the quantity of beans required for this recipe actually takes more than the a cup of water ... if you do pre-soak the beans you'll need to remove quite a bit more, however over 6-8 hours this isn't an issue.   I'm not sure why anybody would pre-soak these beans in water, when you can have them soften up nicely in the flavorful slow cooker.  I divide this into about six meals and throw it over fresh greens.  Awesome.",

                "reviewBody": "Good recipe but needs some fixing: use chicken broth (low sodium) instead of bouillon which is salty. Don't add more salt because the ham and bacon is already salty enough. Six cups water (broth) is too much for my slow cooker but might be enough for others. I have found not all slow cookers are created equal so know your slow cooker before adding the liquid. Personally I think the oval shaped slow cookers can take a bit more water than those that are crock pot shaped. The crock pot shaped ones stand taller. The oval ones tend to absorb liquid more than the tall ones. All of that said it is a delicious recipe. Great for the traditional dish of black eyed peas served on New Years Day.",

Gathering the ingredients I realized I didn't have everything on hand and as I couldn't face going to the grocery store on New Years Eve (what a madhouse) I improvised..... I subbed low sodium chicken broth for the water and bouillon; no jalapeno so I increased the cayenne to 1 tsp; no onion so I subbed one packet of Lipton onion soup mixture; and no ham so I subbed two country pork ribs along with the bacon. Added an extra clove of garlic 1 tsp of liquid smoke and increased the cumin to 2 tsps. Shredded the pork into the peas when finished.... Delicious!!! Husband who dislikes black eyed peas had two bowls! I realize I changed the recipe to fit what I had on hand but I can only imagine the original was excellent as well. Definitely 5 stars!",

I slow-cooked the peas the first 3 hours on High and the next 2 hours on Low, with a hambone from a honeybaked ham from Christmas. Due to other reviews I only added 5 cups water and the mixture was still soupy. However,  the results are WONDERFUL and the honebaked hambone added a slightly sweet flavor, but not too sweet, just enough to make you come back for more. Thanks for the post!",
