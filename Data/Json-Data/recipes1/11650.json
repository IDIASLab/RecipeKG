I substitute butter for shortening, use half white sugar and half brown, halve the chocolate chips, nix the walnuts, and add one teaspoon of vanilla extract. I was skeptical at first, but the mayonnaise makes all of the difference! Next time I'll try cutting back on the fat and use apple sauce to replace some of the butter. Can it get any better?",

You can substitute butter for shortening, you don't have to have enough bananas and you can vary the amount of walnuts and chocolate chips to suit your taste.  I bake it in a bundt pan because I think it presents well that way.  You can dust the pan with cinamon sugar or cocoa if you wish to keep the bread from sticking.",

Also, with making them as a mini loaves, I didn't have to slice it - which help me avoid the problem of some reviewers: that it was so moist it was hard to slice.  With a mini loaf, you just eat it like a muffin! :)  No slicing required!  Just do what my kids did, stuff the whole thing in your mouth! :)",

Two of them were really on their last leg and I was hesitant to use them but maybe thats why these have such an amazing banana flavor! \n\nUpon suggestion of others, I used butter instead of shortening. I also dusted my chocolate chips with a tiny dash of flour and the trick worked cuz they didn't sink! Otherwise I made exactly as shown. \n\nI made exactly 12 muffins and filled the muffin tins almost to the top. They did not overflow. I baked 350 F for 20 minutes. Good thing I checked on them. They looked really done on the top but the toothpick came up dry. They were nice and crunchy on the top but so delicious and moist in the middle. \n\nThis is definitely one of my favorites. I will make this again and again.",
