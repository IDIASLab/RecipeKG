Try some small capers and/or substitute some black sliced pitted olives for some of the green ones; and/or some grilled peeled red or yellow pepper; thinly slice a tropea red onion soak it in white wine vinegar rinse it and substitute for the small onion; and substitute that cheap yellow mustard with some serious mild dijon.... it gets that 5th star!!",
