                "reviewBody": "These are pretty good--a nice wheat pretzel! I've been on a pretzel kick lately & I've always made yeast pretzels so I thought I'd give this one a shot. A little sweet and yes it's dense and heavier than yeast pretzels but I expected that. One: it has ww flour in it and two: although baking soda will allow it to rise any dough made with yeast is lighter in my experience. I used vanilla rice milk (all I had) with a bit of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk. I intended to make 12 pretzels but instead cut out 9 pieces of dough--don't ask me how I managed that piece of wisdom! At any rate for the reviewers who expect huge pretzels like the mall don't be fooled by pretzels you make at home. They are never that big! You'd have to make 1 pretzel for every 4-6 pieces of dough! Also there's no need to use as much water or baking soda as called for in the boiling here. I use a large skillet and just fill about 1/2 way with water then toss in some baking soda--it works out for me and you can boil several pretzels at a time that way. You really just want a baking soda bath--as long as water and baking soda are present you're fine. These are really good with the Clone of a Pretzel Dip also on this site. Thanks for the recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "I have made multiple pretzel recipes from this site and I always have the same complaint no matter how they taste: They never make a pretzel the same size as the ones you can buy at the mall! I cut this recipe in half because I was making them just for me and I didn't need 12 pretzels. I didn't even get them as big as regular mall pretzels and it only made 2!! So if you are thinking that these will come out making 12 pretzels that are the size of 12 auntie anne's pretzels you will be disappointed. However this is true for every pretzel recipe I've ever made. If you actually make them the size they are supposed to be you will get 12 little pretzels the size of your palm at best. ANYWAY what I have determined is that no matter what pretzel you try they always taste the most authentic if they have the baking soda bath. However you do NOT need so MUCH!! There is always all this baking soda water left over. Cut the amount of soda bath in half at least if not just a quarter. uncooked dough doesn't soak it up much. Also this dough is not hard to work with at all as some people stated. If you brush them with butter half way through baking for a buttery taste. These are OK and will do in a pinch but the yeast ones are more authentic tasting. Find a yeast recipe with a soda bath and you're golden. And bake them on parchment to eliminate sticking to the pan. To compare to something store bought these are most like SuperPretzel that you can get in the grocery freezer section.",
