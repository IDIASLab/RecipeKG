Anyway I have been asked to make this cake MANY MANY times over the years. I have even been paid to make this cake. My mother-in-law has dreams about it and hoards it when I make it. I got the recipe from a friend about twenty years ago (when I was in Jr. High School!) and she called it Candy Cake because the icing is like eating fudge. I highly recommend poking lots of holes in the cake just before you pour the hot icing over the hot cake. I use a thick wooden skewer to do this. If I didn't have one then I use the back of my beater from my hand-mixer. This makes it unbelievably moist and heaven-filled! I used to get asked to make the birthday cake for all the birthdays in my office and my co-workers even asked if I would make this cake for my own birthday. It is a definite winner. Don't look any further this is THE chocolate cake! Oh and candacemarie my name is also Candice Marie and I go by Candi too. People think the cake is named after me (since we call it Candy Cake). lol",

Even with that the cinnamon almost over powered it. I wanted a basic chocolate cake not a cinnamon chocolate cake. Also it wasn't very chocolaty. Because of that i give it 3 stars. Now since then i stopped using cinnamon and use a bit more than 1/4 cup of cocoa. The cake is very good and very moist. A good recipe to build off of. Also i did not like the frosting way to sugary.",

It is also incredible how moist and fresh tasting it was, given I made it three days ago and first cut into it tonight! I loved that it called for both butter, for unbeatable flavor, and shortening, for guaranteed moistness. I didn't include the cinnamon simply because it didn't appeal to me and that was a good call for my taste buds.  As for the frosting, it is a fudgy, brownie-type frosting that pours easily and stays soft (even three days later).",
