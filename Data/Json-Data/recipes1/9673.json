At the other party, ladies only, lots of food, lots of these leftover and still no comments about this recipe. I wasn't crazy about them either. Later I tried some of the unbaked leftovers (without the fillo cups) I had frozen as a dip. Weird eggy quiche like consistancy, although good flavor. I was not going to give up on this recipe, and I personally am not crazy about fillo and didn't want to use the puff pastry cups, so I took egg roll skins and cut them in quarters. Layered two squares opposite each in a flower pattern and put them in mini muffin tins. What a difference this \"cheesecake\" is in these. Very good and pretty this way. I felt the fillo took away from the taste - not enough filling to dough ratio and the egg roll wrappers just gave it a nice cup to be in with a little crunch with the \"petals\" sticking out the top. Baked at 350 for 10 minutes an they browned up perfectly.",

(This is rather expensive to make because of the cheese and shrimp so I skimped on the number of cups.) The phyllo dough I bought was already cooked so I simply heated them with the filling in the oven for about 10 minutes. I still had plenty of filling left over for a cracker spread but I should have bought more cups- it was hard enough keeping ourselves from eating them before we got there! If you've been looking for a rave-worthy recipe that's always the first to go at a gathering this is it. Mine were gone in 20 minutes! Thanks for such a great recipe.",

I also don't think you need 16 oz. of Gouda. I believe I only used half of that and I couldn't find smoked. I did not used the onions or salt.

I am going to do the following: add another pound of shrimp add a couple cans of real lump crab add another onion and carmalize them add a little more garlic use one smoked gouda and one regular and call this Shrimp Scampi Rangoon. I made this for Thanksgiving and put them in the phyllo shells I made in the mini muffin pans. I made 4 dozen and still have half of the mixture left. I used the other half of the mixture the next day. I poured it in a glass dish and baked it. I got a lot of compliments on both and several people asked for the recipe. I dont think there is enough meat in it. When I was filling my phyllo cups I was trying to put a shrimp peice in each cup and I found myself digging around in the mixture looking for them. All in all this was good. It does make a ton but it saves well in the fridge. Looking forward to the next time I make it!",

I made it just as written. But...\nI found it very disapointing.  My guests were not very interested either and they were all eaters.  It just isn't that special. And it makes SO much, I had tons lefover.  Not impressed, sorry.",
