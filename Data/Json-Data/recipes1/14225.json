This isn't exactly \"healthy\" - but, I guess you have to splurge once in a while. I subbed red wine vinegar for the tarragon vinegar and roasted red peppers for the mushrooms. I also used capicola and proscuitto instead of turkey and added some provolone.  I didn't bother refridgerating this overnight - didn't want a soggy mess, besides who could resist this sandwich! A couple of hours was all we could hold out before cutting it into sections. Perfect with kettle cooked chips and mild cherry peppers - YUM!",
