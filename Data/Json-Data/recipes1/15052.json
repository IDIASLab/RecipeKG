As for the dreaded modifications; I did cut the butter to 1/2 cup cause we were short on it, and added a whole onion, probably 1 1/3 cups, cause I like onion.  Also added a diced potato to sub for some of the celery and carrot which turned out to be a nice addition.  I used a basic oil/water/flour pie crust. My only minor complaint was it was a little runny, next time I will cut bigger slits in the top crust and bake it a little longer.  Overall the flavor was very good, and I especially liked that there was no canned cream of \"whatever\" involved.  Will definitely make this again.",

Instead of chopped onion I used pearl onions and instead of green beans I used corn. I melted the butter and sauteed the celery, carrot, garlic and onion along with bay, thyme, sage, parsley, a tsp of tumeric for color, and the rest of the ingredients but I omitted the italian seasoning and onion powder. When I dumped in the flour I let it brown a bit before adding the milk and chicken stock. I added the thawed veggies, I just ran them under cold water and strained them. I used some pulled turkey I had frozen from thanks giving and it came out awesome!!! Thanks!",

I made it pretty much exactly as written, except that I didn't have a frozen pea/carrot mix, so I used 1 cup of fresh diced carrots and 1 cup of frozen peas. I also used only a top crust on the pie; a double crust would have been way to rich for me and my family! The filling was awesome, very rich, buttery, creamy, and filling, with just the right amount of veggies and turkey. It was so nice and thick as well...a lot of pot pie recipes out there are to thin for my taste! My family really enjoyed this, and I'd make it again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!",

I like to be able to dip my crust in my filling and it was a bit difficult. Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll either use less flour, or more milk. I'll let you know which it is.",
