And to my mind its consistency was better than good if you followed the recipe. You didn't like it? Too bland? Then ADD what YOU like (corn carrots peas potatoes beans celery onions etc.; salt pepper (red black white) bay leaf tarragon thyme cumin marjoram sage etc.) I personally liked the effect the NUTMEG had on this recipe. I've been cooking for over 40 years and I LOVE making soups (reduce the liquids and call it \"stew\"). And one of the things I have learned about cooking (and making soups/stews) is that if you like what you put into it you will like what you get out of it. JMHO.",

I used Russet Burbank potatoes which were barely medium-sized so if I made this again I'd use 5 pretty large potatoes to get the proportions more to my liking. I made this exactly as written although I took the suggestion to add bacon and put some Oscar Meyer \"Real Bacon Recipe Pieces\" in the soup. Also the serving count for me came out to 5 pretty big bowls. Lastly my palate wasn't sensitive enough to detect the garlic and nutmeg so I found such small amounts to be superfluous here (although I relished the chance to use my new \"dash\" and \"pinch\" measuring spoons!). Overall this was a decent soup to have on snowy winter days but nothing outstanding in my opinion.",
