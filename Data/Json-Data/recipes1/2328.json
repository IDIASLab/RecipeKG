I baked it a little longer as the knife never DID come out clean but took it out of the oven after 1.5 hrs to prevent the crust from burning. The pie set lovely as it cooled on the counter & though my family preferred to call it \"Harvest Pie\" rather that the \"Z\" word I am planning to make this again for Thanksgiving.. zucchini is very easy to grow & versatile in the kitchen.
