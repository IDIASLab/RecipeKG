If you cook it to golden brown it will ruin the flavor. It must be cooked just before browning. I had to play with my cook time and temp a bit cause if it isn't cooked enough they are a little soggy and if it is cooked too much the flavor goes away. I ended up cooking mine at 325 for 15 min. I chilled the dough and rolled them into balls. Then I covered the balls with wax paper and squished them down with a measuring cup. I put the frosting and choc. sprinkles on top. When you let them sit out the do firm up more and are great. I would like to try the icing from Cinabon on top!",

(I didn't have cloves so I used allspice inplace of that) And I put the dough in the freezer about5-10 minutes before I made them into balls (and between bathces) and they balled up fine. I also flattened them just a bit with a measuring cup immediately after I took them out of the oven and they were perfect! Cooked on 350 for 12 minutes. Mmm...mmm...mmm... good will make again! I actually prefer these over the pumpkin roll. Easier to make and just as tasty....",

They were soft and had a wonderful pumpkin flavor. I did not use cream cheese frosting. Instead I used the cream cheese filling from a pumpkin roll recipe and added cinnamon. I used that for frosting.(You can find the filling in all recipes granny kats pumpkin roll) When this recipe is done correctly the finish product is outstanding. My family is very big on baking and this cookie is the best pumpkin cookie yet. The trick to this cookie is not to over cook. The batter is impossible to roll into a ball as suggested just drop by the teaspoon. Enjoy!!!! Marisol",

Rather than using premade frosting I used this recipe ( http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/Creamy-Cream-Cheese-Frosting/ ) and then topped them with some gold-pearl rock sugar (for presentation mostly but it added a nice extra touch of sweetness).",
