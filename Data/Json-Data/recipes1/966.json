I also added more P.B. then called for. Just a hint to avoid the sticky and messy job of measuring the peanut butter: If a recipe calls for l cup of peanut butter, fill a measuring cup with one cup of water and start dropping spoonfuls of P.B. into the water until the water level reaches 2 cups. The P.B. won't mix with the water and you'll end up with a perfect cup.",

I altered the recipe, as others suggested, and used 1 cup of butter and no shortening, I added an additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup of flour. They don't flatten too much when cooking so you can put a lot on one cookie sheet. I baked for 9 minutes and they don't really look done, but they are. They turned out PERFECT!  These were delicious! Great with a glass of milk. I made half plain and added chocolate chips on top of the other half. I posted a picture if interested. Thank you for this recipe...it's a keeper!

I also added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter and rolled the cookies in sugar before baking. The cookies didn't really spread (probably because I used margarine) but I actually liked the crispiness of the ridges. In addition I used natural creamy peanut butter which doesn't have any sugar in it (unlike Jif and Skippy) so I would recommend natural PB if you prefer a cookie that isn't too sweet. I think next time I'll try crunchy peanut butter for a little extra oomph.:) By the way I posted a photo of the finished product in case anyone's curious.",

Lastly, I put a layer of chocolate chips on half the batch right before I put it in the oven. Mmmm, perfect with a glass of milk.:-) Thanks again! Ally\n2-25-07 Made again today on a rainy, gloomy day. They were STILL amazing!  I added milk chocolate chips and 1/8 of a cup of cocoa to the last half of the dough. Yummy!

This was a big help as just a 1/2 c. of PB would have not been enough.Also do as instructed and take out after 8 minutes. You may not think they are done, as I did, but the will soon finish cooking after being taken out of the oven. All I got to say is no other PB cookie recipes even comes close to this one.
