I have never had a problem with dryness and I think it is because the processor does a much better job mixing the ingredients and getting moisture into the bisquick that I could.  Also, they normally take 20 - 25 minutes to cook.\r\nThanks for the great recipe!",

I would say make them with only half the mix and they turn out moister and with more flavor.",
