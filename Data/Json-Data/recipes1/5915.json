Instead of using the lemon juice, I use 1 cup of pineapple juice. Excellent! If you like the pineapple chunks you can use those as well too. PS - I do cheat though! I've made the meatballs from scratch but I've found the frozen meatballs to be similar in taste and much easier! I throw everything in a pot and put it on low. In 2 hours I have every man's favorite.",

The sauce is very good but I would seriously advise you cook the meatballs first and drain them well if you're going to use homemade meatballs.

I prefer to make my own however as I know exactly what ingredients are going into them and knowing that there are no preservatives used.",
