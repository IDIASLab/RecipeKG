I am glad I kept them refrigerated because they do soften quickly at room temperature but all in all, they turned out great.  Everyone who tried them loved them and my friend wanted the recipe.  I had hoped to find a review saying they work even with natural peanut butter but couldn't find one, so now you know!  I'm sure they are firmer with regular peanut butter but I'll save myself the hydrogenated oil!\n\nUPDATE:  This has become a staple in our house as well as many of our friends.  I still prefer natural peanut butter, and I've found Skippy Natural works the best, but you can do with other kinds like Laura Scudders, etc.  Just keep them in the fridge!",

I made a few alterations for my own personal taste as well. I added an extra 1/2 cup peanut butter to the bottom layer mixture.  I  also used Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chips and I used the whole 12 oz bag (for 2 cups  total).  Since I had more chips, I also added 1/4 cup of butter to the chocolate/peanut butter melting mixture.  This helps keep the chocolate layer smooth and spreadable and helps adhesion to the peanut butter layer.",

You really need to pulverize the graham crackers to a fine powder to get the texture of this recipe right (a food processor works great).  I used a 7x11 pan so they'd be thicker.  Taste just like Reese's except the filling is a little coarser.  Keep these babies in the refrigerator or you'll have a soft, gooey mess on your hands!",
