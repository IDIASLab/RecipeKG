Nowadays, if I make it homemade, I use various cheeses (cojack, cheddar, etc.).  This was really good though.  I had fresh carrots that I boiled for a bit before putting it in the cheese mixture.  I used onion powder and garlic powder rather than flakes, which I don't have anyways.  I added some of the carrot water to the cheese mixture.  I used cheddar, extra sharp cheddar, and generic velveeta.  After two of us eating this (technically 3 I guess since I'm prego), there was  A LOT leftover.  I'm a VERY pick 23-year old and wasn't sure about the carrot thing.  I'm glad I tried it.  This is a keeper.",

I boiled the noodles and carrots together & drained and then put the onion (and garlic--had to add that) and little smokies in with the mix from the box and the milk and butter fried that for a minute then mixed it all together. It worked just fine. I do prefer homemade mac and cheese but when you have 20 boxes of the storebought it's hard to justify making it from scratch until the boxes are gone! I like the add ins to normal mac and cheese. Thanks for the recipe!",
