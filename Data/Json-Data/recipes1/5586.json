I saw the recipe lacked any seasoning, so I sauteed two cloves of fresh minced garlic with the onion - and increased the onion to one small onion.  I didn't have pimiento, so I also sauteed diced green pepper with the onion until soft.  I used Chinese Mie noodles (Ramen), low-sodium Cream of Chicken soup (I think this is much better than Mushroom would be!), milk instead of water (much creamier!), sharp cheddar (a little extra) and added ground white pepper and celery salt.  I also let the mix simmer on the lowest heat for nearly an hour waiting on my husband, and as I tasted it every 15 minutes, it got better and better.  Leftovers will be great!  Everyone in the family loved it!  I served it with shredded cheese and a sprinkle of parsely on top.",

The first time I made it exactly as written and received rave reviews from my family.  The next time, I played with the recipe just a bit: I didn't have any fresh parsley, so I added in about 1/2 cup frozen broccoli florets (thawed) with the ham and also tossed in a few sliced mushrooms (from a jar); I was a little low on cheddar cheese, too, so I added some Parmesan.  It still turned out wonderful.  I love recipes that give you some freedom to be flexible (and still taste great!)  This one is definitely a family favorite!",

I doubled the recipe to make 8 servings, and I used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup to cut the calories.  It had a great creamy cheesy mild taste, and the combination of ham, cheese and cream of mushroom made it plenty salty without having to add salt.  I added just a little black pepper and garlic, and it was perfect.  This was also a very quick dish to prepare on a school night.  Thanks!  5*****Stars!",

I added minced garlic and black pepper which were not listed for extra flavor chicken broth instead of water (this does not need salt due to the salt in the condensed soup). I used ham steaks (chopped)and sauteed all vegetables ham and seasoning together before adding the soup chicken broth and cheese - add extra cheese. The family really enjoyed this one (sauteed mushrooms would be great in this but my son would not eat it if I had added them). Since we are ham lovers we will make again and again. Thanks Susan.",

I douubled the recipee and used 4 cloves of fresh garlic and 8 ounces fresh mushrooms which I sauted with the onions. I used a full 2 cups of shereded mozerella and provelone cheese. (It was what I had on hand) I omited the pimento and instead added a 16oz bag of chopped mixed veggies. Instead of water I used chicken broth and added just a tad more than the recipee called for. I also used the whole 16oz box of spaghetti. I used ham but i bet chicken or turkey would be good too. Thanks for such a great recipee.",

I did tweak the recipe a bit. 2 TBSP butter and 1 TBSP EVOO to saute onions in, adding 1 clove minced garlic at the end of saute time, cooking just until fragrant. Increased the water to 3/4 and added 1/2 cup of sour cream to the base. I wanted to increase the sauce so I could increase the pasta. 6 ounces just didn't seem like enough for a family of 4. I used at least 8 if not 10 ounces of linguini. I used 1 1/2 cup of left over smoked ham (yum!) and omitted the parsley and pimentos. Instead, I added about 2 cups of small, crisp steamed broccoli florets at the end. I also seasoned with some cracked black pepper. My family raved about this. I like to try new things fairly often. Some get the go ahead to try again, some go in the trash can. This recipe went right into my recipe book as a family favorite. Thanks a bunch!",
