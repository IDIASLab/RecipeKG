Next time, I'll peel the bananas first and THEN freeze them, or I'll let them thaw a bit before peeling.  Trying to peel frozen bananas was extremely difficult!!  The peeling was difficult to remove, as were the \"stringy things\" that sometimes adhere to the banana from the peeling. I had frozen stubs for fingertips, and it took way longer than the listed 2 minutes just to peel the bananas!!  Otherwise, it was excellent!",

It scaled very well, I scaled it to serve half as much as normal, and it turned out perfectly. The consistency was just right. I used frozen blueberries and vanilla yogurt, and it was a dream. Thick (just how I like my smoothies), and sweet, but not overpoweringly so. Definitely a 5-star recipe.",
