Therefore when I poured the cake batter in the pan I reserved 1/2 of it. Add the cheesecake filling by spoonfuls cafefully spreading it to make a nice layer and finishing it off with the leftover cake batter. It cooked longer than stated but turned out delish while looking beautiful.",

I am not a chocolate fan and was a bit confused about adding the frosting to the cake before cooking (i had to read the recipe 3 times before I did it). It was a huge success. My neighbor (who loves everything I cook but isnt a huge chocolate fan either LOVED it). I have made it 3 times since then. I think I will try it next with a banana cake. Great recipe even though it isnt the most attractive cake. Will definitely make many more times! Thank you so much for sharing!",

It was a lot of work and a lot of dishes but the end result was worth it. I did layer the cream cheese mixture with the cake as other reviewers suggested but my filling seemed to fall to the bottom of the cake. Maybe because I did not use a box cake mix. Next time I think I will reserve one cup of the cake mix spoon over the cream cheese mixture and spoon over the reserved cake mix ontop of it. The only changes I made to this recipe was to decrease butter qty by about half and decrease the confectioners sugar to 1 1/2 cps. I can't wait to make this cake again. Next time I will try it with my brownie recipe or crazy cake recie from this site. Tastes great warm even better when cooled and even better chilled in the refrigerator.",

Unfortunately the recipe directions were inadequate and I acted impulsively not taking the time to read all of the reviews. Judging from the recipe photo I assumed one would need to turn this cake out of the pan. Well the cake bears no resemblance to the photo. The directions do not specify how long to cool the cake if/when to de-pan it etc. I made an educated guess (I've been baking for 30 years) and it was a mistake. I now have a pile of rubble and a mess on my counter. I did taste it and it's rich and delicious but I'm so relieved that I didn't make this for anything important. I'm sure it would be great if we just had explicit instructions. I'll give it another shot if the recipe is amended.",
