I only had half the amount of mozzarella on hand, I forgot the red pepper flake and I used chicken tenders instead of breasts.  Very, very good recipe.  I only have a couple of suggestions.  First, use chicken tenders, they cook faster and they're easier to portion.  Second, I will grind up the croutons next time and add them on top of the cheese.  I could probably use bread crumbs for that, but I like the buttery taste that the croutons give.  I wasn't missing the red pepper flake that I left out.  I was also perfectly happy with half the amount of mozzarella, and I'm a cheeseaholic.  Also, I used a variety of our store's brand of pasta sauce (because it's really, really good).  Thanks Chef John for a great recipe I will use again!",

What I did was coat the bottom of the pan with sauce, place the frozen chicken on top, then cover with the rest of the sauce and spices. Baked for about 45 minutes, added the cheese/breadcrumbs and let that sit under the broiler to crisp and brown up for a couple minutes, and viola! Perfectly moist, flavorful chicken and no thawing required! Lovely recipe.",

Four really big chicken breasts were enough for me. We all liked it--the garlic croutons on the top was one of the best parts of the casserole. Next time, I'd cut back on the parmesan cheese by at least half and also season the chicken before I sauteed it. I served this along side fettucini noodles and a big leafy salad. I'd make this again.",

It's pretty clear from the recipe that it's not really chicken parm - it isn't breaded for one thing. It's more like a deconstructed version of the dish. We loved the croutons, and would probably add a bit more sauce. I used chicken tenderloins, and ended up using about 1.3 pounds of them. Served with linguine. Really nice and easy dish overall - thanks!",

I used 3 cloves of garlic, quite a hefty pinch of pepper flakes, and a nice spaghetti sauce that my family likes. It was delicious! It is best straight from the oven so the topping will be crunchy - microwaving leftovers does not work. The crouton topping is very hearty and NOT for weight watchers... a lot of carbs... may try again without the topping to save some carbs and calories. Also, adding all the cheese at the beginning is not what I do - I cook the chicken most of the way through before adding the cheese... otherwise, it turns brown from overcooking.
