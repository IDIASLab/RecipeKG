While the debate between shortening and lard continues, I recommend using lard as it makes a flakier dough. Since this recipe makes so much I often roll out some extra pie shells or freeze it in small amounts, and defrost it when I need it.  Great when you're in a rush! If necessary, use up to a 1/2 cup more water.",

Add additional water, if required, to make a soft ball of dough.  If the weather is warm, refrigerate your dough for 1/2 hour to chill it before rolling.  Warm dough doesn't roll as well, and requires too much flour, which makes it less flaky.\n"

They're my specialty you might say!\r\nUp until this past thanksgiving, I always used the pastry recipe that has been in our family cookbook for generations.\r\nHowever, last year I moved 2000 miles away, and left my cookbook at my mothers.\r\nWhen thanksgiving rolled around, the night I was to make the pies I couldn't get a hold of my mom to email the recipe to me.  So, I found this one online which is a very similar, but uses lard instead of crisco.\r\nI'll never tell Aunt Phyliss, but this one is SO MUCH BETTER!  WAY flakier, a little easier to work with I found, and still tasted great.  I totally recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a pie crust recipe that will WOW everyone!

It handles beautifully and is indeed flaky -I baked a piece alone with a bit of sugar on top just to see and taste, and it had quite a few layers and a lovely flavor.  The egg and baking soda make it puff (just a little) nicely.  The only difference is that I didn't need the whole cup of liquid, as I live in the Pacific Northwest and my flour must be kind of \"wet\", as I needed only 7 ounces of liquid to get the right consistency.\r\n\r\nA beautiful crust indeed.",

I also now use my standing mixer to make the pastry (with the flat beater) slowly adding the butter to the dry ingredients. Finally I gradually add the wet ingredients. Like many reviewers have mentioned the full cup of liquid is not always necessary. Add it gradually until a ball forms. It usually takes me 5 minutes. To all of you who've commented on it being \"gooey\". I would recommend you re-try the recipe adding the liquid a bit at a time while stirring. You can even use a food processor (according to a friend of mine). I hope you enjoy it. Michelle",
