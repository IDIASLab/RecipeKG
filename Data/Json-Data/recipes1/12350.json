Then, I baked them for about 5 minutes at 400 degrees.  I made this after a Mexican Fiesta Bunco Night and the ladies all raved about it.  I will make this again and again.",

Also- the flour tortillas were too thick and cracked when rolled so I heated mine for 5 seconds and rolled them out with a rolling pin to make them easier to work with. And also when putting the syrup in the tortilla it was very hot and then frying them made me burn my self. I recommend making the banana mixture and letting it cool before frying to avoid burning your mouth. But excellent idea for the recipe- mine turned out delightful!",

I didn't have spiced rum extract so I used almond extract. Tasted so good!!!! I didn't use a cup of oil but only a small amount to cover the bottom of the pan so the oil would not seep inside. I did brush butter on the top when finished and then sprinkled cinnamon sugar. I drizzled the remaining sauce and hubby ate the first one. Before I got the second one done (which was for me) he asked for another! I made the third one with chopped walnuts in the sauce--also delish!",
