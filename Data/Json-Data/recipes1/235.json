Also, melt more chocolate than the recipe calls for so you have a good pool of chocolate to dip the ball into (you'll throw chocolate away, but it will make the product look better).",

The next tip is to use an ice cream scoop to get a scoop of chocolate and then dip the balls in that. The ice cream scoop gets enough chocolate in it to make 3-4 small buckeyes and if it falls off the toothpick, it's not falling far! It also helps to get a full, nice covering of chocolate instead of having to roll around the ball to get the top partially covered. Then, you can use a shallower bowl instead of something too deep for the chocolate.",

I would recommend this recipe with the following tweaks: definitely cut the sugar and sift it- I used about 4 cups which worked well; add a tablespoon or two of shortening to the chocolate to help it stay a little firmer at room temperature; use semi-sweet chocolate as specified(I used a blend of milk choc and semi-sweet and it was too sweet); and to save time just microwave the chocolate at a medium setting and stir periodically- it comes out perfectly creamy and there's no need for the messy double broiler. What a great holiday treat! Yummy!",

Everything was Perfect!!! Also instead of melting the chocolate on the stove I put it in the microwave and stirred it every 40 seconds or so. Much quicker!!! You have to try the recipe this way.
