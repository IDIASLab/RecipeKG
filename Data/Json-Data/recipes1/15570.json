Thank you for sharing Pap's recipe. We enjoyed it and I'll make it again.\nAllrecipes is my favorite site for cooking ideas and I'll never understand how cooks completely change a recipe and rate it down when it's no longer the same recipe after they finish destroying the original. I don't have an answer for this because you see it all the time in reviews but it's a real flaw in the idea of a review.

The only thing this recipe was missing was sugar my family likes their cornbread sweet so I used a scant 3/4 cup. Before baking I threw a good portion of butter into the cold skillet and let it warm in the oven as it preheated then swirled the butter around in the hot pan before adding the cornbread batter. This cornbread was very moist and the bacon fat made it REALLY tasty. My husband liked the flavor the cottage cheese gave to this cornbread he though I'd added sour cream. Good recipe that is easily personalized.",

I didn't take it into consideration that there is already a fat in this recipe and used both (the one described in the substitution and on here) which may have caused my cornbread to be overly moist. Instead of buttermilk I used another substitution; 2% milk and lemon juice. I used 2% cottage cheese. I added chopped up bacon and diced roasted red peppers. I do not have a cast-iron skillet so I greased a small rectangular baking dish and baked it for 25 minutes. The crust was a dark brown but the top was only slightly golden and it was very moist but cooked in the middle. The cottage cheese is great in this recipe. I think I'll try combining this and the \"Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread\" recipe to see if that hits right in between.",
