I wished that I would have added a bit more salad dressing and chicken broth upfront but overall I'm pleased with this recipe. I'll certainly make it again.",

                "reviewBody": "Enjoyed this recipe a lot although altered it significantly due to lack of exact ingredients. I used balsamic vinaigrette. I used a bit over a pound of chicken (one 2 breast pack of Costco's sealed 6 pack) I added one chopped up roasted red pepper towards the end but would recommend adding at the beginning to spread the flavor. I had no chicken broth so used ground beef broth from which I had removed the fat. I added a bit of water so I'd have enough liquid. Rather than cream cheese I used about 1/3 cup of sour cream. Loved the recommendation of just letting the spinach just wilt. I tend to overcook spinach. After letting the spinach stand covered for 5 min I added a bunch of grape tomatoes cut in half. They heated up from the warmth of the rest and it tasted great and looked great. The parmesan adds a lot of flavor. Thanks for submitting! I have never rated before but my husband and I really liked this meal.",

I used a handful of the precooked chicken breast strips didn't have the same dressing so just used a couple squirts of the O&V that I had & a touch of minced garlic. I added a small can of mushrooms at this point WITH most of the juice(didn't have broth)and a cup of minute brown rice (after microwaving). I only used a couple spoonfuls of cream cheese though. Enough to trick myself into thinking it was alfredo but less calories. (half fat) It totally worked!!! I seriously want to like the pan while it's still hot!",

I'd also like to try it with a little onion and some mushrooms - this is the perfect recipe for more veggies. I definitely recommend it and it's easy to tweak to your personal tastes.",
