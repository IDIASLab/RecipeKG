A tap to the bottom of the cup onto waxed paper leaves beautiful balls!  Yum!! I've made them a few times and love them but add 2 teaspoons of vanilla to flavour  Remember to butter hands before playing in coated popcorn or it'll stick!.",

Latex gloves sprayed w/Pam helped while forming the balls! Hope this helps!",

A couple of tips that worked for me was using the gloves sprayed with Pam, break the popcorn into three or more batches(much easier to work with plus you won't have to work as quickly),forming the popcorn in the muffin tins (quick and gave them a place to set up), for the clean up I boiled water in the saucepan to melt the corn syrup mixture then poured that water into my mixing bowl to help clean up that bowl. I was able to make 36 popcon balls out of this recipe.",

My husband informed me that he really liked them so I made an attempt. I must say these were awesome!! I read previous reviews and they were correct on adding the vanilla. I added 1 1/2 tsp., used 3 bags of lightly buttered popcorn in microwave. NOTE: Have popcorn already popped and kernels removed a colander works great. Being organized helped too. Using the insert for crock pot sprayed w/cooking spray and 1 1/2 bags of popcorn, used 1/2 of hot syrup mixing w/sprayed spatula and 1 measuring cup for shaping balls as well as spatula. I just sprayed one hand and rubbed hands to help further shape if needed. The syrup mixture was then reheated and process was repeated. It came out perfect, little bigger than baseball about 22 servings. Used zip sandwich bags to hold and give out. ",

The 2 batches made about 40 baseball sized balls. I'm sure they'll be a hit at the charity sale. It was so simple to make these. I would suggest making your popcorn before starting the sugar mixture. I went through my 3 bags(6 bags all together for the 2 batches)of popped natural microwave popcorn and got all of the unpopped pieces out before tossing it with the sugar mixture. A 13x9 baking pan and a dutch oven held 3 bags and there was room for tossing. I used a cooking sprayed coated spatula to mix and it worked great. We then rolled the balls using our hands. Be sure you spray your hands with cooking spray first. I then let the balls firm up and cool a bit before wrapping them in cling wrap and using a twist tie to close them. The scent and taste of them brought back memories of Halloween and the fall carnivals I went to as a child. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe. I highly recommend it.",
