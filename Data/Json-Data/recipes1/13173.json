Here is what I did: instead of cream of celery soup I used cream of mushroom and added diced celery. I used 1/2 a can of peas minced onion. Also after I drained the tuna I sprinkled onion powder and black pepper on it to let some flavor soak in before I used it. When I added all of the ingriendents to the pot I sprinkled more onion powder and black pepper to the mix and used about a 1/4 cup of milk. The flavor was wonderful!!!!",

I then drizzeled with 1/4 c. butter and baked for 20 minutes. If you want to follow the original recipe and do not like crunchy veggies - I would recommend lightly sauteing the onion and pepper first.",
