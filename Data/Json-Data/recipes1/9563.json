I've made gingerbread cookies in the past; either the dough was too tough to work with, or they did taste like cardboard after baking (the frosting redeemed them).  I did double the ginger, as suggested.  The dough was soft, easy to work with, and did not get hard and tough as we continued to work with it. The dough we were working with mixed very well with the dough we added from the refrigerator. The cookies were  soft when done baking.  The kids and I both liked the flavor.

They came out tasting great:) I also dumped the cloves because I don't like that flavor. The dough wasn't the easiest to work with but I didn't wait the full three hours to roll it out so I can't complain. The cookies held their shape in the oven and stayed soft in the middle. Another minute or two would have added some crispiness and I'll probably try that next time. Great cookies thanks for the recipe:)",

I must have been using potent powdered ginger: unlike other reviewers I found my cookies to have a hot ginger taste. As suggested by others I doubled the cinnamon & added 1/2 tsp allspice. Next time I would leave the cinnamon at 1 tsp to keep the ginger dominant. I used 1/2 cup shortening (all I had on hand) and 1/2 cup margarine. I did not notice a 'molasses taste'. I recommend rolling the dough out between 2 pieces of plastic wrap rather than using a floured surface to reduce the risk of dry cookies. Bake only until the cookies don't look wet. They will be sturdy but still soft when cool.",

The shortening taste is more pronounced than it should be and the taste of molasses and cloves is overwhelming. For the cost of the spices and the time it takes to work the dough together this recipe was a huge let down (my son and I had planned on decorating gingerbread men and had all the fixings to do so - we decided to make another dessert after tasting the cookie) I would choose a recipe with a \"sweeter\" base. These are spicy but not in a way that will be pleasing to children and I have to agree with another reviewes when they said these tasted like dog biscuits. Sorry!!",
