This was a last minute dinner decision so I sub'd buttermilk for half the milk. used walnuts instead of pecans. dbl'd the cinnamon and baked for 25min.  I also put the butter in my pie plate, placed it in the oven while it preheated - that melted the butter just in time for me to add the other ingredients.  plus, less mess.  I will mix the apples, syrup and cinn. together first next time though.  I can't wait to try this with other fruits and nuts.  Seemed more like we had dessert first... no wonder the kids liked it so much :0)  ooh, put it in a bowl and drizzle with a little extra syrup and some cream... MMMMM!",

I feel as if it's missing an ingredient but now that I've realized I missed the boat on the maple syrup (don't have any--was going to add maple flavoring but forgot) I suppose that could be it. I do think however that a caramel bottom would be really good and add to the flavor--just add brown sugar on top of the melted butter like you would do for a pineapple upside down cake. I also added chopped apple and pumpkin pie spice to the pancake batter which I liked. Thanks for the recipe!",

This was very easy to make this morning it literally took a matter of minutes. Using an apple peeler and apple sectioner made it go super fast. My kids really thought this was great. I like making these because it's quick filling and when it's done all you have to do it cool it a bit then flip it out and cut it with a pizza cutter. Plus it's kid friendly for beginning cooks!",

The layered one (apples, half of the pancake mix, apples, the rest of the pancake mix) was great!!! It wasn't dry and it had a lot of flavor. I didn't need to add any extra syrup at the end either.   I did also follow of few of the suggestions other people gave for both versions: I Sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the apples before layering, I used walnuts instead of pecans, and I used more maple syrup than recipe asked.   This recipe was easy, quick, and delicious! I will definitely be making this one again! ",
