I didn't have shortening(used margarine) or nuts(omitted)and it worked great. I reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup because I only had frosted corn flakes. Wonderful change to a basic oatmeal cookie yet remaining simple. Multiple grains (corn oats and wheat). I think I will also use this recipe as a base for different add-ins different cereals etc. I live in the high country so I did add a little a few extra Tbs. of flour. Thanks Herb:)",
