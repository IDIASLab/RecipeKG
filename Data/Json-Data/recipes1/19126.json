        "description": "My dad would stop at our local store's deli each holiday just to purchase the dried beef cheese ball he loved. One year after tasting a similar style, I decided to mix the two together and came up with this dip. It is in honor of my dad who 'had to have' his cheese ball every year! This version is now a staple at all our family gatherings! Serve with crackers or bagel chips. You can use low-fat or fat-free versions of the cream cheese, sour cream, and cheddar cheese to lower calories and fat.  I would not recommend fat-free cheddar cheese though.",

I took this dip to a meeting and actually had a girl give me money to make it for her! The only reason I had left-over is because I didn't cut enough bagel bites up. Would be good with crackers pita chips pretzels etc... I made these tweaks: Used probably half a cup green onions (1 bunch) 32 oz of sour cream. 2 8 oz packages of cream cheese. Blended in blender. Folded in diced corned beef (diced very small) 2 cups sharp shredded chz about 1 Tbsp spicy mustard and 1 tsp garlic powder. I added Beau Monde (not sure how much but at least a Tbsp) covered it and left it in fridge for 12 hours. This was pretty salty but still really yummy. I'm no expert chef but I'm super proud this is the first non-measured and tweaked recipe I've made that's been this well received. I only gave four stars because I did tweak it. Thanks Daisy K.!!!!!! And Connie O. helping me through the Buzz.",

I cut the recipe down a bit by eliminating the plain sour cream and one of the packages of cream cheese but I kept all other ingredients the same. I thought the dip was good with ritz type crackers corn tortilla chips and plain potato chips. Thanks for sharing your recipe DaisyK!",
