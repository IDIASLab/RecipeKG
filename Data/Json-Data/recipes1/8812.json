The only changes I make is that I use Malibu Rum instead of regular rum...it's what I have on hand and personally I prefer it because the flavor is much more mild and I'm not a big rum fan. I definately feel this is a recipe that you should ALWAYS DOUBLE as they will disappear quickly. And they really do get better after a few days...they just don't normally last that long! haha I wouldn't suggest trying to crush the ingredients with anything other than a food processor. It just gives you a totally different type of cookie. I most like these when the cookies and nuts are ground to an almost powder consistancy. That way you taste the 'cookie' not the 'ingredients' if that makes sense to you.",

I used a food processor then stirred in the cornstarch and rum. As we like lots of flavour I used dark rum and dissolved 1 tsp. of instant coffee in it first. In Canada nilla vanilla wafers come in a box slightly under 12 oz. and so I didn't use quite the full amount of rum...just added it until I got a cohesive dough. Then rolled the balls in chocolate sprinkles which is our tradition. Thank you so much. My family are going to love you this Christmas. I know I will be making them each year from now on.",

Use of a blender to powder both the wafers and the nuts (in several small batches) makes this quick to prepare too. Two tips: 1) after blending mixture with spoon use hands to further blend until dough is evenly moist; 2) use of small metal 1\" meatball-shaping tongs produces uniform perfectly rounded rum balls. Also the 2-3 days in an airtight container is essential for full flavor.",
