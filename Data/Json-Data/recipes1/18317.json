It's as good as the popcorn I'd pay $30 for the same amount of here in Chicago. \n\nI think I only used about 3 quarts of popcorn which left a lot of caramel on each kernel just the way I like it.  I popped 1/3 cup of kernels if that helps. \n\nI used a disposable roasting pan, and just let the popcorn cool when it was ready; worked like a charm.  The add ins are so much fun - it really makes it festive.",

I'm sure the phase will pass (or should I say I hope it does) but for now I'm enjoying myself! A lot of people like to use microwave popcorn but I popped my own on the stove and measured it in a wide mouth quart jar. The first time I made it I packed the jars pretty tight and there didn't seem to be enough caramel to cover it all well. My second batch was 4 quarts loosely packed and it was better but not quite covered like I would have liked it. So on my third batch I lightly packed it and used three quarts and I thought it was perfect. During the baking process I stirred it every 15 minutes and baked as directed but it was harder than I would have liked. I only baked the 3rd batch for right around 30 minutes. Using only three quarts of popcorn allowed the caramel to coat every piece. The last batch was my favorite nicely coated and a didn't seem to be as hard as the other batches - a little easier on my teeth. I used a foil roasting pan and it worked out perfectly - clean up was a breeze so be sure to spray your foil/pan with cooking spray. Be sure when you stir it to keep the popcorn separated as best as you can and as flat as possible in your pan. It will make breaking it apart much easier. When it was done baking I kept stirring and breaking large clumps apart while it was cooling. This recipe is a keeper!",
