YOu need to marinade gizzards overnight in either buttermilk, sour cream or yogurt so the toughness is broken down naturally and absorbs the tangyness of the marinade.  Add a couple dashes hotsauce to the marinade and we're talking YUM!  Plus the marinade helps the flour coating stick better and become puffier.  Also add some pepper, a touch of cayenne and msg to the flour (I know everyone is anti-msg, but it really is needed to get the right flavor here. ",

They get very tender the longer you boil them. And rather than a frying pan I used my deep fryer to flash fry. I used an egg wash to get the flour mixture to stick to the gizzards better. I only deep fried them long enough for the batter to fry to a golden brown. Usually around 30 to 45 seconds. I realized I had quite a bit of egg wash left over as well as the flour mixture. So I dropped some egg wash into the flour and made a dough out of it. I also deep fried the dough balls but a little bit longer to make sure they cooked all the way thru. I then crumbled them up into a hot frying pan and added the remaining egg wash to make scrambled eggs. I served those with the gizzards and believe me it was a fantastic meal. The pepper made it a little spicy but I like that. So all I changed was the boiling time, added a bit more garlic pepper and, deep fried instead of pan fried. Delicious.",

Gives them the extra flavour that the plain water removes. The other trick to keeping the batter on is to make sure the gizzards are completely cooled (run under very cold water until cool) and YES I also dip them in a beaten egg with a few drops of water added to the egg mixture. I also add a few drops of hot pepper sauce to the egg mix. Next I add about 1/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs to the flour and spice mix and this produces the most deeeeeelish treat when fried. Hope you try this and enjoy!",
