I put the whole filling in a 9x9 square dish and baked at a lower temperature for longer and loved the result. Also tried this in a deep pie dish and it turned out very well. When cooked to perfection pie has a light golden-brown top to it. TIP: Watch closely in oven and check often. A normal depth pie dish will be done before the stated time window. Once the pie is set in the middle pull out because it burns quickly afterwards.",

I cut down the vanilla to 2t instead of 1T and substituted regular raisins in lieu of golden and it was all good. Other tips: do NOT make this into two pies. I had two deep dish 9\" pies and split the batter then rolled the crust down to the edge of the batter. If you combined into one large pie the top would burn before the middle set and it's such a rich pie that you wouldn't really want to have a super deep slice. This would go very well with vanilla ice cream. I thought the lemon juice ingredient would impart some lemon flavor - it didn't and next time I make this I'll be adding some lemon zest and removing the raisins altogether.",
