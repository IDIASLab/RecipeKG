However, I substituted the mozz and parm with a full bag of the pre-grated Italian Mix Cheese made by Sargento.  Then added one additional cup of mozz.  Instead of just salt, pepper and parsley, I used garlic salt, parsley, oregano, sweet basil and onion.  YUM!  The filling made enough for an entire box of manicotti noodles.  Hint:  Only pre-cook the noodles until they are slighty tender, the sauces and cheeses assist in cooking it the rest of the way.  And, to fill, try using a pastry bag!  Took me less than 5 minutes to prepare after I precooked the noodles.  A keeper.",

They will cook in the sauce to a perfect consistency while in the oven. Just cover with tin foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes so the cheese on top melts and gets that yummy finish.",

Though I did make my own sauce (I sauteed ablout 1/2 lb of mushrooms in butter and garlic and the added a 16 oz can of tomato sauce and added some basil, pepper and more garlic to taste) and I added extra mozzarella on the top toward the end of baking.  This was my first time making manicotti and the first time my husband had ever had it at all.  We both LOVED it!  and it made yummy leftovers too.  Will definatly be making again soon!  Oh and I used the zipper bag method for filling.  I left the pasta a bit more under cooked than \"al dente\" (the box said 7-10 minutes and I cooked them for almost 5).  WOW it was so easy!

Instead, I used 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs.  Also, I used 1 tablespoon of parsely and 16 ounces of mozzerella cheese. (Throw in some garlic powder too!)  Yum.  The cheese mixture was almost too easy to stuff into the pasta and came out very delicious.  Hint:  Add 1/4 of sour cream to your cheese mixture if it seems too dry before stuffing.
