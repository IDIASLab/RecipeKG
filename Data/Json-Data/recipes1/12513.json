To make things easier (and to distract from their look) using a mini-cupcake pan with paper liners I simply pushed a 1/4\" thick disk of dough into the bottom of the cup pressed a kiss into it pressed another 1/4\" thick disk down around the kiss and baked them for 6-1/2 minutes to compensate a little for any pan/heat absorption.",
