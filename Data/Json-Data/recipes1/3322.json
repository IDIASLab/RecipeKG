Being a no-bake cookie and rolling them in granulated sugar makes things a lot less messy too than rum balls I've made in the past rolling those in powdered sugar. Little trick I learned....go to the liquor store and buy the little miniature bottle of Bacardi dark rum. It's just enough for the recipe and you don't have to spend a fortune on a whole bottle of rum (unless you have other uses for it...LOL)! Recommend these 100% and these will be on my \"regulars\" list of Christmas cookies.:-D",
