The flavor was really good. Next time I'll cut down by 1 T the lemon juice and the worcestershire. I'll definitely make this again my way.",

So even though there is a lot of butter (and that is why it is good!), I used the sauce on Jill's, decreasing the Worcestershire sauce to more of a hint than 3 T; I added the veggies (peppers, sauteed onion, mushrooms) and WAY more parmesan; and served it over angelhair pasta like the restaurant does.  It turned out really good.  My husband loved it and so did I.  I'll make it again.  Thank you to all 3 contributers!  :-)",

I left out the lemon juice till a few hours before I cooked it. I didn't want the acid to cook the chicken. After boiling the sauce for a few minutes it got kind of thick so i added a few teaspoons of olive oil to thin it up a little. I served over pasta and with a side of asparagus. Delicious! EDIT I tried with shrimp and it was also delicious. I only marinaded for a few hours and it was plenty. Next time I will try with fish.",
