The eggs are separated the whites beaten until stiff and folded in at the end. True Brownstone Front icing has evaporated milk 2 sticks of butter and 2 cups of sugar cooked to soft ball stage cooled to room temperature and then beaten to spreading consistency. It is a pain from start to finish but worth the trouble once you get it right. It takes a lot of practice and more than one failure.",
