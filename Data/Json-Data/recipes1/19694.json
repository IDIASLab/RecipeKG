I am surprised to learn bison meat is leaner and less calories than most meats. Also the cooking time is less than cooking beef. I would suggest if you make the guacamole salad to add the juice of 1/2 lime or lemon to prevent the guacamole salad from turning brown. Next time I will use garlic salt or garlic powder in the salad. I am not a fan of the \" too much garlic after taste.\"",

At first I really didn't know what to expect from the bison flank steaks; however now I can tell you this it does not taste gamy at all. In my opinion it tastes more like beef. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I did use the \"Fajita Seasoning\" from AR by trmeeds and grilled the flank steak whole and sliced after cooking. The rest was made per the recipe. The fajitas and guacamole salad are definitely keepers. Thank you Bison Council.",
