I read that some found the peanut butter taste was bland on its own and one said the bread was dry and crumbly. I made the following changes to the recipe and it came out nice and moist with a peanut butter taste that makes it good to have on it's own. I used 1 heaping cup of peanut butter, used 1/2 cup of milk instead of 1 cup and used the other half in sour cream and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  It resulted in a tasty, moist bread. Thanks for the recipe idea!",

The pro's being: very simple ingredients that you always have on hand and it being a delicious dense moist bread. I'd planned to freeze 1/2 the loaf but ended up eating the entire loaf within a few days. Went great with some honey drizzled on top and a cup of tea on the side; with butter and coffee in the morning; with blackberry jam and a glass of milk for an afternoon snack. My friend even smushed up a ripe banana and spread that on her slice of bread. A great basic bread that you can dress up with just about any imaginable topping.",
