I decided to use one reviewer s suggestion to use canned sweet potatoes and made two pies using a 2lb can which I could have divided to make a single pie. However because the canned potatoes were not hot or even warm - the ingredients didn t combine as I had thought. So before I added the eggs - I popped the whole thing in the microwave to incorporate the milk potatoes and spices then added the eggs and beat with my electric mixer this made the consistency alittle smoother. Tip: I used Apple Pie spice which is actually cinnamon nutmeg and allspice combined. Also I did not have the grated orange peel so I used orange juice instead. It came wonderful and my husband loved it. Next time even if I do use canned - I will heat the potatoes up first.",
