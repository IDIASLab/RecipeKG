The dough was still sticky so I did roll the amount I was working with in flour. Also I found if I cut them before they dryed over night it was a much harder cookie. Thanks!",

After waiting over night I ended up blackening the bottoms of some. On the up side my 9 month old really likes them and so did the 2 year old I baby sit. So I'll make it again. I like the taste of the batter so I was a little disappointed in the taste after cooking but then again I was not cooking them for me and thank God I am not teething because those cookies live up to their name.",
