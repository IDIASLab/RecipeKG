After watching the video I did some research on the tarte, learned it was originally made with puff pastry, which I happened to have on hand, so that's what I used. I made it with Honey Crisp apples and, as per other reviewers, I added cinnamon and also a dash of ground cloves.\nThe tarte came out of the pan perfectly, although I have to say there was more moisture in my tarte than in Chef John's, which probably helped.  Delicious, oh so easy.  I'm making it again for Thanksgiving.  It's really nice to have such a great looking dessert that one can put together so quickly and easily.",

My rating is based more on personal preference, rather than how successfully it turned out.  I gave a \"4\" because I found the Granny Smith apples a bit tart for my liking and craved a bit of cinnamon to add depth to the flavour.  I will definitely make this again (SO easy!) and just change to variety of apple (Gala, maybe?) and add a bit of cinnamon.  Thanks, Chef John!",

                "reviewBody": "I was looking for alot more from this recipe. Difficulties started with the clarity of the directions. I wasn't sure whether this called for melted butter or not in step two. The directions state to coat bottom of pan with butter which seems to mean in order to coat it needs to be melted however then when placed on stove in step 4 it calls for cooking until butter melts. Which is it? When I went to flip the tarte in was stuck to the bottom of the pan. I had visions of a beautiful tarte and instead it turned into a mess. I ended up using a spatula to get it out and there was no presentation to it at all. To top it all off it was bland. This needs some cinnamon and nutmeg. Will not be making again. Sorry Chef John. I am usually a big fan.",
