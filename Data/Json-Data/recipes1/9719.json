It wasn't too overly sweet just right. Also (using normal white bread) I cut the slices in half on a diagonal before putting it in the egg mixture. That way it was easier to take in and out of the hot oil. It makes it look a lot nicer too. Oh..and I ate two piece's but it only works out to be one piece of bread so it wont be as harsh on the waist line! I hated french toast til I found this recipe!",
