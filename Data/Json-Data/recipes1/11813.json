I marinated the chicken over night and then I brushed it over the whole shish kabob before grilling. Just be careful not to marinade it longer than over night because I made the mistake of marinading for two days and all you could taste is soy sauce. Way too salty this way. I highly recommend this recipe if it's not marinaded too long.",
