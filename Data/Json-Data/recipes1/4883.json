Be sure to get them nice and browned on the outside to assure that the inner chicken meat is fully cooked...I had to nuke mine an extra minute after cutting it open to find slightly raw chicken inside.",

Chicken breast stuffed with rosemary-scented pork is very nice but it needs something to really make it shine. A nice sauce would really help here since chicken can be dry. I tried it with a garlic-and-lemony veloute and was satisfied but a creative cook could do more with saucing this dish. Serve it with an earthy mushroom risoto and green beans or asparagus stir-fried with oregano (or marjoram if your tastes are more subtle).",
