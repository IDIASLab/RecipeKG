The recipe is really good, the keilbasa tastes wonderful in this delectable sauce... but this shouldn't be cooked in a slowcooker.  At the end of the 5 hours, I got sausage mush... which I should've expected because keilbasa is alreay cooked.  Horrible in the slowcooker.  Tried this again but heated the concoction up on the stove for a few minutes and it was delicious.  Don't do this is a slow cooker!",

I cut the 2lbs of kielbasa into bite size pieces then browned them in a pan with a little bit of oil.  If in a hurry I would throw them in without browning them first but they tend to come out mushier that way.  After browning I put them on a plate with paper towel to soak up some of the oil then throw them in the crock pot with \u00be cup brown sugar, 2 cups of Ketchup, 15oz can pineapples chunks undrained, 1 cup of teriyaki sauce, 1 red onion sliced, 2 green peppers sliced. 4 hours on high served over white rice.  It has quickly become a party favorite and everyone asks for the recipe.",

When I found this recipe with the pineapple, I read the reviews and since so many others thought it was too sweet, I used the grape jelly from the first recipe instead.  It definitely is better with the pineapple but I didn't really like the almost stewed pineapple.  Next time, I would add towards the end of the cook time.",

The sauce was a bit too sweet though,so the next time I make it I will cut the amount of brown sugar down to one cup or maybe even less. I am anxious to take this to our next pot luck! I have to agree with some of the other reviews that the sausage does get mushy when cooked for the designated length of time. So I cut the cook time way down, just enough to get everything heated through.",
