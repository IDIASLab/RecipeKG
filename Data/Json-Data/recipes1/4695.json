From reading everyone's thoughts I decided not to cut the chicken and instead I spiced it with onion powder, garlic all-spice and rosemary. I then seared the chicken to a nice crisp brown. (This added a wonderful presentation--no more goopy mess!!) I also added some chicken broth with the rice and soup BEFORE I added the chicken. I let that set on high for about 15 min. while I cooked the chicken. Then 3 hours later (on high) I took the chicken out and served the sauce over fresh-baked biscuts. I will make this again. Wonderful with a glass of cold white wine. Wonderful!!!",

I omitted the celery soup and added 1 can of  water.  I added 1/2 tsp of celery seed, 1 tsp of dried parsley, 1/2 tsp of black pepper and 3/4 pkg of Lipton Onion Soup Mix (DO NOT ADD SALT).  Stir everything really well.  I then placed the frozen breasts in (DO NOT CHOP THESE, JUST PLACE THEM IN WHOLE).  Cover the breasts with the soup.  Put the lid on the pot and you're good to go.  I cooked it for 4-5 hours on HIGH.  I stirred the meal after about 4 hours and turned to LOW until everyone got home (about another hour).  Would have given it a 5, but the first time I made it, it wasn't as good as I had hoped (followed the original recipe exactly).  But the author was on to something good.  The slow cooker is the way to go when you're at work and the clean up, WHEW!  Easy.",
