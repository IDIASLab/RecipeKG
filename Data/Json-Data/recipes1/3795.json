(Except seasoning it to your liking, i.e., garlic powder, oregano, italian seasoning...)  This is not your typical \"spaghetti casserole\" and it's not meant to be.  If you want regular spaghetti then make regular spaghetti. It kills me when people alter everything about the recipe in their reviews.  Then it becomes something totally different. Do not substitute the tomatoes for ready-made sauce.  You'll lose the whole idea of the recipe!  Yes, cream of mushroom soup!  It will not be the same with out it.  It kind of acts as a sealer to keep the noodles from drying out.  Great with garlic bread and even better the next day!  ",

With alterations as follows everyone raved about the dish: I upped the green pepper (used a whole large pepper) used two cans of italian diced tomatoes added one 8 oz can tomato sauce almost doubled the mushrooms by using over 1/2 a lb of fresh added 1 tsp italian seasoning 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper; I reduced the cheddar to one cup and added two cups of mozzarella mixing them together; to the bottom layer of pasta I mixed in 1 jumbo raw egg 1/2 cup parmasan cheese and salt and pepper (to form a better \"crust\"); I had to up the water in the soup a bit (maybe to 1/3-1/2 c) and sprinkled basil s & p over all. With these complicated sounding but really easy alterations it was awesome! Served with crusty french bread cesear salad and the chocolate pudding pie off this site (see reviews).",
