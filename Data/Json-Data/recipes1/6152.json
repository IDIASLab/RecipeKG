I took the milk and threw it in the blender with my honey to blend it together well.  I also reduced the amount of cream by 2 1/2 cups and replaced it with milk. Then instead of refidgerating it over night I just tossed it in the ice cream maker and enjoyed it. SO SIMPLE and delicious. I have made chocolate (added 1/3 cup coco)AND mint chocolate chip(I used peppermint extract instead of vanilla and tossed in some chocolate chips) By far my favorite recipe!",

Unlike others, I found the recipe's vanilla amount to be perfect once the amount of sugar was reduced.  There were reviewer complaints about a buttery or butterfat taste.  I believe that to be due to trying to dissolve all the sugar without using an ice bath to keep the cream chilled.  The room temperature and the natural temperature rise due to stirring or whisking would warm the cream enough that they were churning butter.  It has happened to me in the past, and is a nasty surprise when butter is not the goal.  Try whisking the sugar into the half-and-half, then stirring in the cream.  This recipe is what ice cream is all about.  Mmmm good!",

But today I was looking for something simpler, easier and less time-consuming. This was it.  The proportions of whipping cream to half-and-half are a little heavier on the half-and-half than my general preference (2 parts cream, 1 part half-and-half) but the difference here was marginal and might suit better those who prefer a less rich ice cream.  Since I used this as a base for blueberry ice cream (3 cups blueberries macerated with 3/4 cup sugar and the juice of half a lemon, then pureed) I omitted the vanilla.  However, if I was to use this recipe as is, I would still reduce the amount of vanilla somewhat. Even with the addition of the fruit, which often tends to lend some iciness to the ice cream\u2019s texture, this was creamy and smooth. This is a rich and delicious ice cream, a worthy competitor to the cooked custard variety \u2013 I *almost* didn\u2019t miss the eggs.",

Rather than heat the half-and-half as some recipes suggest, I powder the sugar using my Vita-Mix. A regular blender will also work. The fine powdered sugar blends easily with the liquid.  I normally powder the sugar, and add it to a quart mason jar. I add enough half-and-half to fill to the 2 cup level, shaking until well blended. Then I add the heavy cream to fill the jar. I can do this a day or   If you want to try a real creamy treat, use all heavy cream. I know some try to use non-fat products, but I have never been one who considered ice cream to be a health food. It is something to enjoy occasionally, calories and fat be damned.",
