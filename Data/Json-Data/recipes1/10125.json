I'm a professional musician and recording artist, and I often find myself in the kitchens of recording studios, trying to make something edible from the staple ingredients studios keep in their kitchens. Well, this recipe is it!!! Everyone has milk, eggs, salt, butter, and flour in their kitchen, and these babies whip up like a charm! Even the batter will keep in the fridge for a few days. Personally, I like to throw in about a third cup of granulated sugar and a quarter cup of powdered sugar to make them sweet and a little crispy around the edges. Just be sure to put a fresh dab of butter in the pan before pouring the batter each time. I've tried countless pancake/crepe recipes, and nothing really impressed me until this one. I recommend it most enthusiastically!\n\nChristine Anderson\n",
