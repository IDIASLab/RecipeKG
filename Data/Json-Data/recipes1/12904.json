I've used the other recipe often and loved it as long as you added sherry which was missing from the ingredients. I saw this last night and decided to try it. This is now the one I will make - the ingredients are all on the mark - I just added two minced scallions and a pinch of thyme and cayenne pepper which it didn't need but that I like. Both are 5 star but we prefer this one now.",
