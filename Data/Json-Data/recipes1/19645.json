The only change I would suggest is a mix of cheddars in place of the sharp cheddar and reduce the velveeta to 2 cups instead of 3 and using 2 jars of Alfredo sauce instead of all the velveeta. The velveeta really covered those great complex cheese flavors. The corkscrew pasta was a wonderful touch!",

For the cheese sauce, I omitted the onion and instead of using the velveeta cheese and jarred alfredo sauce, I made a roux with butter and flour, added 2% milk and then 12 oz. of smoked cheddar cheese along with some nutmeg and a dash of cayenne and salt and pepper. I mixed it with wagon wheel pasta and the sausage and topped as directed in the recipe.  Then baked as directed. It was delicious and we loved how the smoked cheddar complimented the smoked sausage flavor.",
