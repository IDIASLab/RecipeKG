But it was completely worth it when I showed up for my friends' \"Sex & the City\" Potluck Night and they all raved about how great it was. Medium was the largest size of Starkist canned shrimp that my grocery carries and they turned out to be a pretty good size. To cut down on calories I used fat-free cream cheese which definitely helped cos the french fried onions had more than 100g of fat in the one can. Yikes. So if I could think of a way to use just 1/2 a can and mix it with something else to sprinkle on top then it would be absolutely perfect. Oh yes one final thing: when I make this again I'll cut up the asparagus into bite-sized pieces. The long strands of soft asparagus were just too hard to eat (and serve).",

Like other reviewers, I, too, cut the asparagus into pieces rather than leaving in stalks and used fat-free cream cheese to cut down on calories.  The canned shrimp seemed rather expensive so I purchased shrimp from the grocery's seafood/deli area, which was cheaper and doubled the amount used (to 16oz).  \r\n\r\nIt's a fabulous recipe and it's quickly becoming one that I'm known for bringing to events.
