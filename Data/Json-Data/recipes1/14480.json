Once they got a couple of bites they were sold and kept asking for more. I thought the chile paste might have been too strong for the kids but nobody minded and I thought it was just perfect for me. I even liked the way the rice was cooked on this recipe versus the way I would normally cook it. Next time I'll probably make twice the rice and twice the sauce. Fantastic recipe!",

Just a really flavorful peanut sauce. I had some thin-cut pork chops on hand which I sliced into thin strips which worked great for this instead of chicken. Also when I got home the dogs had gotten into the cabinet and eaten the honey so I just added some sugar instead. I doubled the sauce (and I'm glad I did) because I'm always scared there won't be enough sauce. Oh and I added some chopped fresh cilantro as a garnish which really added to it making a nice fresh flavor. I'm trying to get my burgers-n-fries boyfriend to branch out and accept ethnic food and he loved this! Awesome recipe!!!",

I think there is an error in the recipe when is states to \"mix in the greens beans and rice\" I think it is supposed to be \"mix in the grean beans and Chicken\" and then serve over rice. I skipped that part all together anyway. I placed the green beans and chicken on top of the rice and the poured the sauce over it. Superb! Thanks for sharing Erin!",
