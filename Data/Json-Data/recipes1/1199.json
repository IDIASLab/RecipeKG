I reduced the milk to 1 cup, and also made my own pumpkin puree - not hard, ladies!  Get a pie pumpkin, remove the seeds, cut it up into 6 or 8 chunks, place it in a pan with 1/2\" of water, cover with foil and bake at 375 degress for about an hour, or until a knife slides easily into the flesh.  Let cool, and scrape the pumpkin away from the rind.  Mash it up as best you can, then take other's advice and put the puree into a colander and let it drip into a bowl (cover the whole thing with plastic wrap and set it in the frig overnight). This should help avoid having such a watery pie like many have encountered.  Also, once I combined the pie filling ingredients, I ran it all through my blender to smooth it out.  The end result was an incredibly silky texture... This is not a dense, orange pie like you get from a can. Much lighter in color and more delicate. (A little more spice probably wouldn't hurt.) Consider decreasing your oven temp by 15 degrees & baking a little longer till the center sets up. Your crust will thank you.",

I make about 30 pies between October and November as friend from pumpkin patches send white pumpkins my way!!!  I think I finally perfected it this year...this recipe does make 2 pies and the secret in using fresh pumpkin is in how that is prepared.  After making the puree put it in a collender lined with coffee filters set in a bowl and wrapped with plastic wrap for 24 hours before attempting to make pie.  This will keep pie from becoming soggy and will cook in the time given in the recipe.",

She said it tastes just like the one my grandma used to make for her when she was a little girl! I did change a few things though. I added one teaspoon of cinnamon instead of 1/2 a teaspoon I only put in 1/2 cup of 1% milk instead of 1 1/2 cups and I bought only the regular whipping cream not the \"heavy\" whipping cream. I added about three TBL extra of whipping cream before I poured it in the pie shell because it looked like it needed a little more liquid. I also added one full 15 ounce can of pumpkin and then another 1/2 cup from another can... I baked it according to the time given in the directions let it set at room temp for a few hours then refrigerated it for a few hours and it was DELICIOUS!!!! I couldn't stop eating it!!!! Will definately make again!",

I cut pie pumpkins in half and scoop out the seeds and goop with a grapefruit spoon - that seems to work out pretty well. Then place on a foil lined baking sheet and place the pumpkins cut side down. (I use a little bit of Pam so they don't stick). Then I completely cover the pumpkin with foil and put in a 350 degree oven for about an hour. However some people say they can get two cups of puree from one pumpkin but I seem to only get one so I have to do two pie pumpkins. After they have roasted I scoop the pumpkin out of the shell and then throw them in the food processor to make the puree smooth and creamy. I've found out after experimenting I don't need to strain it I think the roasting keeps the pumpkin from being too watery as opposed to steaming which I think makes for the watery pies I've heard people complain of. But thanks for the recipe this one is a keeper!",

I would also make sure you either have an extra crust or some oven-proof bowls, it was way too much filling for even my 9\" deep dish crust.\n*Used this recipe again this year, and followed it exactly.  Either I didn't do it right last year or my tastes have changed, it's delicious!  It still makes enough for two pies from each batch, but everyone loved them, so they disappeared VERY quickly!",

I've been making pies from a can since I was a kid and I had a pumpkin leftover from Halloween and had guests coming over for dinner so I thought what the heck and made the pumpkin puree myself. One thing to keep in mind is that it the filling made with homemade pureed pumpkin is much more watery than a canned pumpkin pie so don't be surprised when you put it into the pie crust. I accidentally spilled a good portion of it out of the shell but that ended up being a good thing since it took awhile to cook. I would suggest making a thinner pie rather than deep-dish with this recipe so that the crust won't burn by the time the filling sets up (took about an hour with filling that was maybe 1 1/2 inches thick) and the filling will rise a bit so it won't be thin in the end. I did have maybe 1/3 of the filling leftover after I filled my crust so I threw it in a loaf pan and baked it separately to make a pumpkin custard. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and drained the puree in a colander lined with coffee filters overnight which yielded at least a cup of water which would have made the pie soggy so I'm glad I did that and would suggest it to another who wants to make this pie from scratch. The end result was the absolute best pumpkin pie that I've ever had. Wasn't difficult but was time-consuming but definitely worth the effort.",
