I doubled the recipe (I have 4 kids and a vacuum for a husband). I substituted half whole wheat flour with the all purp and reduced the butter to 1c. I also reduced the brown sugar by 1/2 and they were still pretty sweet. Next time I'll probably reduce the white sugar too. Oh it really helped to chill this dough before baking too! I definitly recommend this one.",

I used 1 cup whole old-fashioned oats instead of baby cereal I used 2 bananas instead of applesauce added only 1 stick of organic butter and I added an extra 1/4 cup flour. It still seemed to thin so I placed the dough in my mini-muffin cups. PERFECT!! My kids gobbled them up - begged for more. I think this is as \"healthy\" as a great tasting cookie can get.",
