You can poach your eggs in advance then remove them from the boiling water and place them in a large bowl of ice water, make sure you have plenty of ice in your bowl of water.  You can let the eggs stay in the water while you prepare your other ingredients. \r\n\r\nWhen you are ready to assemble your eggs benedict simply remove the egg from the ice water and put it back into your boiling water for just a few seconds until it gets warm enough to serve.  You will be able to have a number of eggs ready on a moments notice using this method.",

An easier way to make Hollandaise is in the blender. Place egg yolks in blender with the lemon juice (1 tablespoon is what I use) and other seasonings, turn blender on high speed for 5 seconds to blend. Melt butter in microwave until completely melted and hot. Turn blender back on high speed and gradually pour in butter. It will thicken into a beautiful yellow hollandaise in 20-40 seconds.",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent! And I tried all the various versions suggested by other reviewers. The blender method makes it easier and faster, but the double boiler method tastes less eggy and the heat blends all the flavors together very well. Another advantage to making the sauce on the double boiler is that you can keep it hot till you are ready to serve.\n\nThe key to using the double boiler is to make sure the water is only simmering (not boiling) and NOT touching the bottom of the sauce pan. (I used key limes instead of lemons, and added a couple of extra drops of Worcestershire sauce (to taste).)\n\nCombine the eggs, lime/lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce in a separate bowl before pouring into the double boiler. Then KEEP WHISKING, DON'T STOP, even after the last drop of butter has been added, keep whisking till everything is smooth. \n\nMaking this receipe is like conducting an orchestra. Prepping is key. I started with the bacon then popped it into a warm oven. I also put heat-safe  breakfast plates in the oven to warm them up. I made the sauce, then when that was done, I took it off the double boiler and set it aside. Then I popped the English muffins in a toaster oven (on light toast), then used the water in the boiler to poach the eggs. Stir up the sauce while the bread and eggs are cooking. The bread and eggs should be done simultanously. I garnished with a sprinkle of Hot Hungarian Paprika.",

I saw this recipe reviewed it and decided it was something I could do - he LOVED it!

I was a little intimidated at first, but the eggs really turned out delicious as well as the sauce. Be sure to add the vinegar to the water as it really helps hold the whites together. Thanks!",
