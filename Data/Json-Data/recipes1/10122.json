I did omit the cinnamon and swithed the amounts of water and coffee liqueur. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

I have been on a (very expensive very messy) quest making recipes from many sites one of which is the acknowledged king of cooking sites--America's Test Kitchen and I have just not been happy! However I can tell you for texture moist and dense chocolate flavor that is intense but not overwhelming this is your cake! My search is over!! PS: You don't need frosting for this but I would suggest a little confectioners sugar or cocoa powder dusted over the top and maybe a fresh fruit and mint garnish just for looks. Many times when people see a cake in a bundt style they assume that it is dry and crumbly... This cake would be passed on by at the potlucks I go to--My husband calls it a \"Sleeper\" cake you can put it out and be assured that there will be a piece left for you when you are ready for it--it won't get gobbled up unless someone knows your secret.

I used fat-free sugar-free pudding mix and light sour cream thinking I would save a few calories; then (I'm embarrassed to admit this) I negated the calorie-save by drizzling on an entirely unnecessary chocolate glaze.
