Also I did not have apple cider and so I used pear juice which I did have and as for the yogurt I had vanilla low fat. And the squash I I had a buttercup squash but I tell you I put all that together and it came out the greatest soup. One thing is for sure you really must have the yogurt garnish or it will be bland. Oh also I did not have white pepper I had a mixture of peppercorns and ground those fresh and used that instead. If you love squash you must try this soup.",
