My recipe is slightly different but easy to remember. I use one cup of boiling water 1 tablespoon of cinnamon candies 1 package of cherry Jello and 1 can (or the equivalent) of apple sauce. It can be doubled tripled...you get the idea! When people ask for the recipe the 1:1:1:1 ratio is easy for them to remember. Lately I've been making it with cinnamon oil like the kind that flavors hard candy and that's even easier. It takes a few drops per cup of water. Enjoy!",
