I wouldn't change a thing next time!  I also pan-fried my shrimp instead of grilling - cooked about 2 minutes on each side, on med. high heat.  The second time I made this, I marinated overnight.  Although the flavor was wonderful, it made the shrimp turn a little mushy, so I won't do that again.  Thanks so much for the recipe!",

Instead this marinade was a GREAT fusion of flavors. The best I've tried in a very long time! Instead of skewering them, I grilled the shrimp in a Brookstone Quick Release BBQ Skillet ...This is a shallow, nonstick grilling skillet with plenty of small holes to let that great grilled flavor through! To me, the ingredients really said 'green onion/scallion' and not regular onion so that's what I used. I marinated the shrimp for 5 hours. Our family's only problem was that there wasn't nearly enough of them, and there were only 3 of us for dinner! Absolutely outstanding flavor with that hint of grilled smokiness to them. Can't wait to make it again!",
