Probably the only true constants are a pre-heated iron skillet and I would say lard (Crisco) instead of butter but maybe that's just me. This recipe is hands down the best one I've tried in a long time. I have to qualify that by saying that I made it with sorghum syrup and I don't think it would have worked as well with honey. The tang of the sorghum combined with the sour buttermilk was what made it really work for me. I do think cornbread can be too sweet (or too eggy or too cakey) but I've never tried it with sorghum before -- perfect!!! Also I doubled the recipe for my 10\" skillet because cornbread goes really fast at my house and I needed each slice to be pretty hefty. Finally I'm not a big fan of sprinkling the cornmeal in the hot skillet -- if you're skillet is hot enough (okay I also made this at 425 instead of the suggested 400) I don't think you really need it and it can cake up if you're not careful. Having said all that this will be the only recipe I use from now on.",

I placed the oil in my cast iron 8\" skillet and then preheated the oven with the skillet on the middle rack.  I left the skillet in the oven while I prepared the cornbread.  I removed skillet from oven and sprinkled the tablespoon of cornmeal on the bottom of the skillet.  I then poured the cornmeal mixture in the skillet and it sizzled slightly.  I placed in the oven and baked for 21 minutes.   Removed and coated top with butter.  Recipe did not specify white or yellow cornmeal - I used white!  This is not a sweet cornbread!  Outside is crisp and golden inside is moist!  Excellent with honey butter!  Thank you Mason for sharing!",
