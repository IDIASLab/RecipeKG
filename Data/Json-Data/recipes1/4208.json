Let me start by saying that this is the best sausage and peppers I have EVER had!!!! I followed the recipe exactly and I am not sorry about a thing! Well I did add a little extra water as the sauce was a little to thick and we like to serve it on rolls. Don't be intimidated by all of the spices in this sauce...it makes your taste buds stand up and take notice. Thank you Jimmy for this recipe and for not being afraid to add a little of this and a little of that...BRAVO!!!",

                "reviewBody": "UPDATE: MY BF & I JUST HAD LEFTOVERS. THE SAUCE (AS IS) IS VERY THICK. TODAY IT WAS REALLY THICK (ALMOST THE CONSISTENCY OF TOMATO PASTE!). I THEREFORE ONLY RECOMMEND EATING THIS FRESH. Pretty good sauce. Made this for dinner last night. My bf enjoyed it and thought it was quite filling (it was just \"OK\" for me). My only complaint (if you can call it that...) is the expense incurred for MSG (never used it in all my years of cooking!) vermouth and anchovies. I ended up tossing most of my leftover anchovies as they do not refrigerate well and I rarely ever use them. I WILL use the vermouth although not often (most of my recipes do not call for it and I do not care for martinis...). I found MSG at my local specialty spice store (small bag only cost 1.75) and REALLY cheap freshly made Italian sausage at the Italian market. Neither the vermouth or anchovies lent a distinct taste to the sauce (IMHO). In the future I think both could be omitted. Served over penne pasta with a side of sun-dried tomato & garlic parmesan artisan bread to soak up all the yummy sauce and spumoni ice cream/Italian butter cookies (compliments of my Italian bakery) for dessert! A couple of things to note: This makes a TON (def. more than 4 servings worth). Also if you are concerned about using anchovies... DON'T BE. They dissolve into the simmering sauce and are barely noticeable. Thanks for sharing!",
