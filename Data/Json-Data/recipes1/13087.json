It didn't take too long to make or set in fridge and it was a nice light and cool alternative to pumpkin pie after a big dinner. There are a few changes I made. First - instead of a graham wafer crust I made a crust using a good quality ginger snap and left out the sugar. I added a few shakes of ground ginger and ground cloves along with the cinnamon. I believe the recipe should say 1/2 pint whipping cream whipped as 1/2 pint (1 c.) of whipping cream is not near enough to spread on the top. When whipping up the 1/2 pt. of cream add a tsp. of vanilla and a tbsp. or more to individual taste of icing sugar. Enjoy!",

Also added a dash of nutmeg and ground cloves to the pumpkin mixture as well as some cinnamon to the crust. I'm also going to try making the crust with crushed gingersnaps next time just as a spicier alternative. It didn't seem like I could taste the cream cheese layer but maybe it's just one of those things that you can't taste until it's gone. Looked very pretty with the layers though and held together well.",
