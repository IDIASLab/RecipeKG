(In this case the broccoli and mushrooms I used made their way from Florida to Wisconsin before it all finally ended up on our plates) This \u201cHot and Tangy Broccoli Beef\u201d was just what I was after.   We can do the \u201ctangy,\u201d however, because of Hubs sensitive innards we can\u2019t do the \u201chot,\u201d so I had to leave out the red pepper flakes.   It didn\u2019t make a difference \u2013 this was plenty good without it.  Mushrooms filled in for the onion because, again, I\u2019m leaving town again in the morning and wanted to use them up.  But they couldn\u2019t have been a better choice had they been written into the recipe.  Other than that substitution I followed the recipe fairly closely, only substituting peanut oil for the vegetable oil.   We try to monitor our carbs (especially after a couple weeks worth of pasta in Italy!) so I served this over \u201cMiracle Rice,\u201d described as \u201cShirataki rice, guilt free rice, zero calories, soy free, gluten free, made in the USA.\u201d  It is expensive, smells foul, looks unnatural and tastes like nothing.  I\u2019d highly recommend substituting a little bit of rice or nothing at all...",
