Didn't use choc chips because I didn't have any (and didn't need any) but used 1-1/2 cups of chopped pecans. Made the house smell so good I couldn't wait so cut and ate two while they were still warm. Just wish I had some ice cream to put on top. Absolutely marvelous and still moist 3 days later kept in Tupperware. The only reason they lasted so long is because I live alone, plan on wrapping a few for the freezer before I eat them all. Can't wait to try different flavor variations. Thanks so much for posting Penny.",

So here's my take....way too sweet! Holy cow! And a bit too oily. But very tasty! I had a very similar recipe that my neighbor gave me three years ago and that my daughters love to make. It calls for the cake mix a 1/2 cup of oil (instead of butter) NO ADDED SUGAR 2 eggs (rather than 1) 2 TBS. water and the chips and nuts. You make regular drop cookies with this and bake them for 8-10 minutes. This is a fantastic recipe for young kids and it is extremely versatile. We usually make it with M&M's in place of the chips and no nuts but we have also used chocolate cake mix and peanut butter chips. I now always keep cake mixes in the pantry for when the girls want to bake cookies (this is also a good project for them to do on play dates). So last night I had a yen to make these bar cookies again but I used this older recipe but with only about 1/3 cup of sofened butter instead of the oil and only 1 cup of chocolate chips. Delicious! Perfect! I would definitely recommend that you try this variation.",
