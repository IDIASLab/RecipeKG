It's easy with a few tricks. To get \r\nthe canned milk to whip up beautifully, put in the freezer until it's as cold as it \r\ncan get before freezing.  When it's cold you can shake the can and the milk inside \r\nwill quickly froth up enough to stop sloshing.  Use high speed with a good mixer, \r\nmetal bowl that is previously chilled and a whisk attachment.  I cheat and use a \r\nchilled plastic bowl and get soft foam that works well.  But I used to get stiff peaks \r\nwhen I had a metal bowl.  Be sure your canned milk isn't low fat.  After beating \r\nthe cream cheese mixture, throughly mix in the luke-warm to tepid gelatin mixture.  \r\nTHEN fold that into the whipped milk.  I'm glad to find this recipe again.  It's as \r\ngood as I remember.  My husband and son now love it, too.\r\n",

Mix the milk with your cold beaters. Do not whip up the cream cheese mix first. The cream cheese leaves a residue on the beaters that prevents the milk from forming stiff peaks. Besides the cream cheese mix works just fine with a spoon or wire whisk. Peaks should take no longer than 2 or 3 min on high speed beaters at the most. If you touch the surface with your finger or a spoon and when you pull away it forms a peak...voila you are done. It's not rocket science people and the finished product is ab fab. For those of you looking for an easy way to soften your cream cheese....while it is still in the foil package...place it on the burner on the stove top that your oven vents through. While your crust is baking the cream cheese is now soft and creamy enough to not need beaters.",
