I just loved this one. It's a beautiful clear color not too sweet or tangy but definitely just right. It's a great mixture of sweet tart & tangy. I halved the recipe as I said I was trying them out (the only change I made was to use brown instead of golden raisins - because it was what I had on hand); but I'll probably make a full recipe soon and give some as gifts.
