I've tried this recipe exact as it is a few times now and for some reason I don't seem to get a good garlic taste from the marinated meat itself (have used a few different cuts as well). While I can add some of the garlic oil as directed at the end which makes it tastes better it seems like the marinating is extra work for not enough payback. I would prefer to cook a good steak and add some garlic butter to the top of it then go through all these steps. Having said all of this though I LOVE this garlic oil for bread dipping. I have made it for that purpose and added herbs to it and it is amazing for that. So I have given the recipe 4 stars because of that but I do think that others should try the full recipe version to see what they think.",

                "reviewBody": "My rating isn't for the cooking, its for the fact that the picture is NOT a N.Y. steak, its has a bone in it and is very juicy looking, which N.Y.. steaks, while expensive, do not. Looks more like a rib eye.  Second....two 12 oz. steaks for 2 people???  Unbelievable, that's enough for 4 people at least.  So, while I love John's recipe, unless you're feeding someone who doesn't know the cuts of beef or the amount for each person ( about 4-6 oz.) its not correct.",
