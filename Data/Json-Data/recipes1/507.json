Mine come out so nice and crispy and perfectly chewy at the same time and the taste is wonderful. I put the malted milk balls in a ziplock bag and hit with a rubber mallet to break them up.

First I made these with 2 cups of Robin Eggs (candy coated malted milk balls) and 1 1/4 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chunks. Second I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup of each sugar because the Robin Eggs are much sweeter than the original malted milk balls. Third I added 2 tsp of vanilla. I had to cook longer for about 12 min. The cookies are very thin but nice and crispy around the edges and chewy in the middle.",
