I added cranberries and raisins, and tossed the apples in a tbsp of lemon juice, added the cinnamon and nutmeg to the topping that others suggested, and used blueberry flavoured maple syrup and it was amazing!  The crunchy topping was such a delightful change from regular crisp recipes.  Thank you!",

Everyone loved it - it all went really quickly.  \r\nGreat recipe in the autumn when you have lots of apples to use up!",

After baking it (and eating it) I found this recipe needed no changes no \"tweaking.\" The amount of topping was just right it was not too runny (if you bake it long enough and allow the juices to thicken as it cools) had the perfect level of sweetness and needed no spices. It's a good basic apple crisp. Still it was somewhat disappointing in that I had high hopes for a more prominent maple flavor and it just wasn't there even though I used the stronger Grade B maple syrup. So while this was very good it doesn't really set itself apart from other apple crisp recipes.",
