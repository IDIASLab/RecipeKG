Four would be too much and the dried cranberrries did not do anything in regard to flavor or garnish since they sank to the bottom.  (The reviewer who said Christmas in a glass had it right.)",

I could only find cranberry-apple tea, so I used that.I made the recipe to try to use up some mediocre homemade wine, and you couldn't even tell the wine was not good.  The spices and tea made such a nice flavor combination.  I let it sit 24 hours for the first batch.  I making batch #2 right now for thanksgiving.  I don't know if my apples were large, but it seemed like you could get away with half the apples.  It is so good- try it!",
