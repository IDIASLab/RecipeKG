I did not have overnight so I let the mixture sit for approximately 4 hours at room temperature to macerate and mix the flavors...turned out great. I soaked the anchovies for about 10 minutes in milk to leach out some of the saltiness but next time I think I will just add the can with the flavored oil directly. I used a food processor to mince not puree. I'm busy trying to think of more uses for this magic little sauce (maybe stuff steamed artichokes and top with parmesean/mozarella?).

But I will always try something new because my motto is: you won't know if you like it unless you try it. I literally finished making this less than 15 minutes ago. This was SOOOOOO good I just had to immediately hop on the computer and leave my review. I apologize for butchering your recipe but I did make changes based on ingredients I already had at home. I used cilantro instead of parsley.I used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar.I didn't drain the anchovies and used the olive oil that was already in the can of anchovies instead of using the 1/2 cup of olive oil.I added 12 capers. I then dumped everything into my mini food processor and lightly pulsed until I liked the way it looked (maybe 10 super quick pulses). I know it should marinate overnight but what can I say? I was CURIOUS! So I grabbed a veggie cracker just to dip the tip in next thing you know I'm carrying it to the living room to sit on the couch and dig in with veggie crackers and with celery sticks. Thank you! I'm making this one of MY family recipes!",
