The rolls by themselves just wasn't our favorite, but buns for burgers now that's a different story. This recipe gives info for bread, rolls and chocolate rolls, but if you want to make buns...let the rolls rise again for 20 minutes and then put in the boiling solution.  I only boiled my rolls or buns for 30 seconds on each side. In all fairness, we didn't try it as loaves of bread. Five stars as buns (for us.)",

It will kill the yeast.\n3) If you're still having trouble (I have issues with quick rising) try this.  Follow the directions up to and including turning the dough into the greased bowl.  Cover with a damp cloth.  Refrigerate overnight.  Then follow the other directions.\n\nI do this for ALL my breads, as I can't get a consistent rise the other way - this method was in an old recipe for french bread, and gives me a consistent rise every time.  I never rise my dough at room temp, but always use the overnight method or I end up making bricks.",

These were absolutely amazing! I followed the recipe as directed except, since I was making rolls, I followed the advice of the person that said to let rise 20 min after punching down for rolls. The only thing I would change or add.. is to add Kosher Salt before baking!!! I plan on making pretzel sticks, nuggets everything with this recipe. This was great. Oh. .I also kept on 400 for 12 min, and then 350 for 10. Perfect!!!",
