A little of this for sure goes a long way and I don't even want to know how many calories I consumed but it recieved good reviews at the Halloween party I made it for tonight. THANKS FOR SHARING!:)",

I would tweak it the next time using gruyere instead of swiss and trying shallots instead of green onions and I used garlic salt instead of celery salt. I skipped the poppy seeds because I didn't have any. Also overcooked it...it did not need the time allowed in the recipe. The bottom ended up over-done.

The differences with our version: use a 1lb loaf of Hawaiian sweet bread add 1 tsp garlic salt and a tsp lemon juice.
