I wasn't sure if I'd like everything processed so much (I used a food processor) but the texture was fine even though the only identifiable ingredient was a few bits of fresh cranberries. The crunch was still there. The only change I made was that I zested both oranges before peeling/seeding and threw the zest into the food processor. I will definitely use this recipe again.",
