While it does seem that the nutrition info is a bit high, for those questioning baked vs. fried, you should know that baking (with half a cup of butter!!!) does not mean it's healthier than frying.  It's not JUST the method of cooking, but simply the amount of oil/butter you use.  Look here for the nutritional info for 1 cup of butter: http://www.calorie-count.com/calories/item/1145.html\nHalf a cup would be around 90 grams of fat and 800 calories, not including the chicken itself.  For each serving, that's over 20 grams of fat in butter alone.  Also, each serving here is 1 pound of chicken (not distinguishing white/dark meat)!  That's a big serving of chicken.  Dark meat also has significantly more fat & calories compared to breast meat (3-4 times more).",

I'll never go back to the pan fried again. I cooked it per the recipe except I doubled the recipe and used a package of six leg quarters. I separated the legs and thighs and had to use two pans. (Quite reasonable at.69/lb.) The coating was as if it was fried and had a beautiful golden/brownish color. My octogenarian father raved about it as soon as it hit the table. Wife made excellent gravy..I'm good with gravy only out of a jar. The flavor was great!! This is now my new staple. Thanks Candy!!",

To the seasoning mix I used heaping measurements of all the spices listed plus added 1/2 teaspoon of both onion powder and garlic powder.
