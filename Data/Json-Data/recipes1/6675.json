I lined my dish with foil and sprayed with cooking spray - makes it easy to just lift out of the pan to cool, frost and cut.  I made a small batch of Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site for these.  These came out pumpkiny, spicy, buttery, and moist!  A cross between a bread and a cake.  The only thing that is bad about this recipe is that it doesn't make enough!  I would double the batter for the 9x13 to get a taller bar.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

I chose this recipe since I had all of the ingredients on hand it had received positive reviews. Well, here comes one more A+ review! The cake turned out great...moist, spicy and delicious. My co-workers couldn't stop raving about it! The only mods I made were to replace the bread flour with AP flour (worked like a charm) and add a bit more spice to it (without measuring): ginger, cloves, allspice, cinnamon and a hearty dash of vanilla. I frosted it with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this website. A perfectly easy bar/cake to whip up on a whim!",

I switched the recipe up and bit - I used all-purpose flour, which worked just fine and I was generous with the spices as I always am when making gingerbread, sweet potato pie or anything similar.  Plus, I used more like 1 cup of pumpkin because 2/3 cup just didn't seem like enough.  Also, I opted to use butter instead of shortening because I thought that might make it a little more flavorful.  Shortening would probably be fine, but the butter worked out great.  I iced them with cream cheese frosting.  Yum!  I will definitely make these again.",
