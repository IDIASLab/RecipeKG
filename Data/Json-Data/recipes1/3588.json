With this soup I ommited the chicken broth and replaced it with vegetable broth the vinegar I used is tarragon vinegar and I added dill weed since I like a lot of dill with my cukes I added a lot. I also used half and half with this recipe instead of sour cream it seems to make it rich flavor. Since I like a heartier soup I added more farina(cream of wheat) to the soup then I pureed it. Mix everything up and let it sit overnite and before serving I puree it again and serve. This way it allows the flavors to blend. I think the next time that I make this soup I will try adding a little white wine. This soup is one of my staples during the summer. I pair this up with a cold vegetarian sandwhich and a tall glass of of Ice tea.",
