I substituted honey and molasses for the brown sugar and I omitted the sunflower seeds and the bread flour for spelt flour to get 100% whole grain bread. I also used oil instead of the butter. I also like to add dissolved (in water) vitamin C tablets to my bread it always makes the bread come out better (smoother and soft) for some reason.\n \nIt makes a small loaf so I will double it from now on. This makes a great gift loaf of bread, great for sandwiches, french toast, toast or with dinner.  Not heavy at all either. Dh and my picky eater little sister loved it, even asked for the recipe.",

I wanted a 100% whole-grain bread so I used all white wheat (white spring --Wheat Montana and King Arthur have this as do other brands, and it's a great way to get a lighter, sweeter flavored whole-wheat product) and it worked wonderfully. I used just 3 TBS of sweetener as suggested by others and as I didn't have sunflower seeds or quinoa, I used rolled oats and doubled up on the millet and flax. Great toasted. Makes a small loaf so next time I'll double. I  also took mine out after dough setting and shaped it and let it rise for 30 min and placed it in a greased bread pan on a lower rack for 40 min. at 350. Delicious! Thanks Debbie!",

I have now made this loaf a few times & instead of the brown sugar I add 2TBS. honey & 2 TBS. molasses. I also now make this into a full loaf.....so it will last a day:)",

It made a fairly small loaf in my 1-1.5# bread machine but was perfect for me and my daughter.  It is particularly good when toasted (with peanut butter on it...yum!).  The next time I will put the crust setting on light, as medium made it a little too dark for me.  I will also probably increase the amounts of seeds and nuts.  Thanks so much for sharing!",
