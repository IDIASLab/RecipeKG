Instead of onions I added leaks, which for the most part, I did not puree and these gave the soup some body. I used one leek, almost top to bottom. First I sauteed the leeks in the butter, then added the can of broth and half&half. I used only one can (14 oz.) of chicken broth. Then I steamed the asparagus until then were bright green but still crunchy. I pureed the asparaus (left some for garnish) and mixed in with the broth. Three really basic steps. It fed two adults and three children (ages 6,8,3)with about 1/2 serving left over. I used no other flavoring but what the recipe called  for (and the leeks) and the taste was wonderful. I did not use pepper (kids might not like it.)",

I was worried that the asparagus would need to be pureed - don't bother.  Much more taist whole.  Will do this over and over.  Really quick and yummy (also - veggie broth is perfect).",

And because I wanted a creamier Cream of Asparagus Soup I used equal measurements of chicken broth and half and half. I don't know creamy this would be if prepared with so little half and half! I didn't feel all that flour was necessary so I reduced it by nearly half but because I used a higher proportion of half and half than the recipe directs I probably didn't need any at all. I sauteed some minced shallot and garlic before adding the asparagus then seasoned it lightly with Herbes de Provence to give it another dimension of flavor. Finally I pureed the soup which is different than the recipe directs. The final result was a 5-star soup.",
