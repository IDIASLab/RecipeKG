Also when I served it at the beginning of dinner it was quite runny. Later when some came back for seconds it had a better texture - the cheese had hardened a bit rather than running through the casserole - so I would suggest letting it sit 10 min. before serving. Last week I found \"Festive Onions\" on this site which we loved - easy great tasting and a beautiful presentation - souffle looking - definitely fit for company. I'm still on the fence about this one - not sure I'll make it again.",

I didn't have any beef bullion so I substituted beef broth for the water and bullion. Since bullion is so salty I sprinkled some Tony Cacheres' Creole Seasoning on the onions as they were cooking to make up for the lack of flavor from not using bullion. I will definitely make this one over and over and over again!",

I halved this recipe thinking that my hubby would be the only one who would enjoy this dish. How wrong I was!! Not only did Drew devour his portion but the kids thankfully tried it and gobbled up theirs. I really loved it too and was scraping the sides of the casserole to get every last morsel! I didn't have any chips on hand so I used salsa flavored \"Bugles\" instead. Trust me I'll certainly be making this again!!",
