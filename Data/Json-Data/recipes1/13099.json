Its a pretty easy recipe to follow and would be fun to do with little kids because of it ease of making (I don't have a mixer so I have to mix by hand) and not needing too many things to make it... I can understand how people can find it tastes like flour and so solve this problem I added a little vanilla and about an extra 1/2 cup of sugar ( just free poured and tasted till it was a little sweet) I didn't add pecans because I don't usually have any on hand so instead I put a small teaspoon of Raspberry Jam before baking them in the oven... I put them in a preheated over at 300 degrees for 10mins then took them out and let them cook on the stove off the heat of the pan. I finished them off with a light sprinkling of icing sugar. Not sure how they will turn out and if they will be a hit with the roommates as other recipes have been off this site so far but we'll see.",
