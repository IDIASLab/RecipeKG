My tinkerings included sauteing the onion w/ garlic and bell pepper using grated squash and zucchini (both of which I drained salted in a colander) and adding salt pepper paprika and fresh basil to the top b4 baking it. It smelled heavenly and did taste pretty good (w/ the addition of a healthy splash of hot sauce) but next time around I'll go much heavier on the seasonings.",
