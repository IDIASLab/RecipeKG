I couldn't figure out why I kept getting starchy water until he explained the method of cutting the potatoes lengthwise vs. cutting into cubes. I ran out of whole milk, so I used buttermilk. Plus, to make them extra creamy, I added 3 tbs. of sour cream. \n\nBy making those adjustments to the recipe, I'll just say that they were such a hit at thanksgiving dinner, all we had to take home was the container I brought them to dinner in!",

My husband couldn't believe it, I told him I had yet to make any better than Bob.  That is until now!  I made these last night with some country steak and gravy and they were delicious!  I did just as the recipe called except I only had 2% milk so that is what I used.  Luckily I already had the right potato masher and not one of those other weird looking objects that Chef John was showing in the video NOT to use!  Thanks again, I'm planning on making your mushroom gravy this evening to have with some more mashed potatoes and meatloaf!  We can't wait!",

I waited until about 11pm the night before the potluck, before getting this going, so a lot of the pointers like how to cut them in halves helped out in the process for boiling them. Along with what masher to get which I picked up the same style one Chef John recommended, and the other little pointers given, all a big help in keeping me moving along with the prepping, and cooking, and mashing (at the ridiculous hour I was cooking these!)  I made just over 10 lbs so I got done about 1:30am!  All around a big thanks for the informative video.\n \n Russet Potata!!! I love how he says it.
