This is a recipe that can be altered to use up other fruits you have on hand. I have used a mix of mangoes and peaches to make this, and it would probably taste great with pineapple or other tart fruits, but if you like mangoes as much as I do, you will want to let that flavor dominate. Optional to chill before serving.",
