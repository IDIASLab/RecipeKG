With apple crisp, peach cobbler, bread pudding, stewed rhubarb or just a spoon - it's delicious.  Sometimes I add less sugar if it's going on something sweet.  We have chickens so in the summer when we're being buried under a landslide of eggs, I will double the number of yolks - still perfect.  Thank you so much for giving the temperature, no more deciding if it is thick enough coating on the back of a spoon or straining my custard because of lumps.  Sometimes I add the brandy and zest and sometimes not - always delicious.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!",

The extract is made from 100 blossoms of edible lavender soaked in 100 proof vodka for six weeks. So there is liquor involved. It was lovely. I put it in a shallow dish upon which I put a round of lemon cake filled with raspberry and lemon (separately) curd between layers. I topped it with three fresh raspberries. Very rich and creamy creme anglais. Love it even without the cake.",
