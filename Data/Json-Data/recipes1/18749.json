Good flavor on the filling even with the dreaded tofu LOL! Tastes like a chocolate pudding pie. The crust crumbled for me trying to get it out of the pan still tasted great all mixed in with the filling. I microwaved the chips to melt worked fine. Just 45 seconds and stir less time at the end. I had extra filling left over I would suggest a deeper pie plate as the crust was thick in my shallow 9\". In the video she says to only cook it 10 minutes and didn't cool it before she put the filling in. Try it you'll like it! Thanks for the recipe.",
