I should have suggested some additions and alternatives that I use when I submitted this recipe, so I will now.  First, you can substitute the first 1/2 cup of \"white\" granulated sugar with brown sugar.  I also often add spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or ginger.  Finally, I usually use orange juice instead of apple juice.",

My husband thought it was perfectly sweet with the reduced amount of sugar. Also added a tablespoon of lemon juice that I read from another recipe. Personal tip: I found it easier to remove the apples and thicken the syrup and then stir the apples and syrup together. I wanted to be sure that I didn't have any clumps of cornstarch in the bottom. Will definitely make again! Thanks Darcy.",

I've always made apple pie the traditional way but would fret the whole time it cooked wondering if it was going to be too runny, too tart, etc.  Its so much easier making it this way, pretty much fool proof.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon and used macs cuz thats what I had. The only tip I have is to cut the apple slices pretty thick so they stay in tact. I think I'll use this recipe from now on.  Thanks.",

It will be the only apple pie that I will ever make again.  I did raise the amount of cornstarch to 4 Tablespoons and also added in fresh nutmeg and cinnamon.  This is a keeper....YUMMO!",

I only made a lil change instead of apple juice I added a splash of white wine WOW!!!! you only have to wait for the alcohol to evaporate. Maybe next time i'll cut down on sugar because white wine makes apples mixture even sweeter. I made this pie yesterday night and i'm sure i ll have to make it again next weekend!!
