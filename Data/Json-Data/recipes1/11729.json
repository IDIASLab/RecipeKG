One of the problems with the recipe is that it doesn't give an exact amount of asparagus - it says \"1 lb, trimmed and cut into 1/2 inch pieces.\"  I ended up with a little too much asparagus because I read it to mean one pound of asparagus AFTER it had been trimmed - so the quiche came out a little too \"moist\".  But it was good and I'm just going to use less asparagus next time. This amount worked just fine for one quiche in a regular pie plate. Took about the same amount of time to cook, too.",

Instead of steaming the asparagus, like others, I sauteed them in a little bit of the leftover bacon drippings (saves you dirtying another pan).  I used about 6 pieces of bacon (to please my meat-eating husband), but other than that I was pleasantly surprised that the amount of ingredients actually fit in pie crust.  Baked for the 35 suggested min. and it was perfect.  And I love the addition of the nutmeg!  Will use this recipe in the future, but probably not with my husband, who enjoyed it but still calls quiche 'girly food'.  ;)",

I modified slightly by using 2 refrigerated pie crusts and put them in a 9 X 13 baking dish (overlapping some in the middle of the pan) instead of 2 individual pie pans because I was taking this to a brunch for several people and wanted to be able to cut into square servings.  It was a big hit.  Will definitely make again.",

I sauted the chopped asparagus in butter first & added 2 tbsp finely chopped shallots that had been sauted in butter.  Also, I substituted grilled chicken (cut into small cubes) for the bacon and increased the salt.  The quiche tasted great to those who liked asparagus, while others thought the asparagus taste too strong (I personally liked the taste).  The only problem was a soggy crust bottom (the filling is very moist).  I will blind bake or pre-bake crust next time (for about 10-15 minutes)and cover the crust to avoid burning.  I will try again with bacon!",
