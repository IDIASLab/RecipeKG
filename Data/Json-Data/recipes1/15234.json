It's been many years since I last made a cheesecake but after many dissapointments with store-bought, I offered to bring a homemade NY style cheese cake to a family dinner.  I used a spring form pan and a pan of water in the stove.  I did get one crack but otherwise this cheese cake turned out PERFECT!  A lot of critical mouths had seconds and thirds of this great recipe.  Don't be concerned if you get a crack in the cake because it will still taste great and can be easily covered with topper. I read many reviews and the do's and don'ts.  DO: use room temp ingredients.  DO: use name brand ingredients.  DO: bake for an hour then turn off the oven and let sit in the oven with the door closed for several hours.",

If you do not have a sweet tooth do not add sugar to the base. Just the cookies and melted butter will do. I even reduced the sugar further in the cheese mixture and it tastes great. My family enjoyed it so much. Nice and smooth texture too. I will bake it again:)",
