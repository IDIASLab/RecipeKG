Made it but actually had to explain to my Hubbie what a Tuna Melt was, haha. Guess we have had different life paths.

The taste was unsurpassed and I enjoyed every bite. Later that day I realized that I had enough tuna to do the entire thing again. And I did! Second best decision that I made all day.
