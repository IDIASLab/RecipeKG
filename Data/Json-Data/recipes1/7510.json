I did however have to made adjustments because I made it for 5 people only. It had a very good flavor but it was very tough. What did I do wrong? Or could it have been just the brisket? It was a 1.50 Lancaster Brand Brisket. Please let me know because I would like to make it again soon. Thanks Nancy P.",
