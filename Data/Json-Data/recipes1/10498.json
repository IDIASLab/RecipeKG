It's authentic, and absolutely perfect and a piece of cake to make. I subbed crab instead of salmon, but will try salmon too! At our local HEB it's expensive to buy, but now, I can make my own @ less than half the price and they taste better!  Fresher!  Thanks for sharing!  My only comment is this...when making the rolls, dip your fingers in water to spread out the rice on the nori...also, dip your very sharp knife in water too...helps to cut the seaweed very cleanly!",

Wrap tightly in saran twisting ends to keep filling in ends. fridge for several hours first to firm--a huge hit at parties!!!",

I add thinly sliced scallions to the cuke / avocado. I love this served with a sweet soy dipping sauce containing 3T soy 2T sake or sherry 1T brown sugar and a sprinkling of sesame seeds! Another good dip for those who like chilli is to use 4T soy 1T rice vinegar dash of hot chilli oil and some red pepper flakes. LOVELY!!!! Finally use wet hands when rolling use a bamboo mat for best results and use a wet knife for slicing. Happy sushi making!",
