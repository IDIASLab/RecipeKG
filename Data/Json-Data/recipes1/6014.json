I added the onions to  this recipe and the only other thing a did different was to use canned petite diced tomatoes. My daughter kept walking by the frying pan and dipping french bread in the juices.  I didn't have any sticking problems like some others, but I used my electric frying pan so I could control the heat better.  Thanks for the recipe!!",

Although I could easily make a meal of this with salad and flat bread I had extra kids in the house and so coupled it with Zucchini Patties and some pilaf. Everyone ate everything! Make sure you have plenty of good bread on the table to mop up the delicious juices.",
