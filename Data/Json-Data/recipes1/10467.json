I worked in small batches and moved the finished schnitzels to a rack in a warm oven and they stayed crisp and perfect until dinner was ready. I served them with \"German Spaetzle Dumplings\" from this site and lemon wedges to squeeze over the schnitzel and it was fantastic! We used to go out to a Bavarian/Bohemian restaurant in the area for schnitzel and spaetzle and spend a small fortune on dinner. Now I know I can make just as good at home for half the price (or less!). Thanks for this great recipe.",
