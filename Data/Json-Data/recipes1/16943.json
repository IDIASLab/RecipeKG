We're trying to lower our cholesterol, so the more veggies I can squeeze into our day the better.  It went great with the Thai Coconut Soup recipe from Allrecipes.  And I was excited to use bok choy for the first time in a recipe.  I didn't use the leafy part of it, don't know if you're supposed to or not.  Thanks for sharing!",

I didn't use chicken bullion however so perhaps that is the problem; I used 2 cans of chicken stock and it seemed to work well. I did have some issues with my rice cooker; perhaps the amount is too much for it? I had to keep unplugging and starting it on cook again. It does make lots of rice for two people anyway so I believe I'll halve it next time. I agree with the other reviewer who suggests more liquid less rice and more veggies. Thanks for the recipe!",
