Plus, you can customize it according to your tastes or what you happen to have on hand that day.  I always add corn & mushrooms.  I also, like other reviewers, make more potato's than the recipe calls for.  I've found that making a serving for 6 (according to the box) covers a 9x13 pan perfectly.  We also add the cheese during the last 10 min's of baking - just enough to melt it.  Great recipe for a cold winter's day !!  Thanks Cathy",
