I took this dish to a family get together and it was a big hit everyone seemed to love it. I seasoned the potatoes with salt pepper garlic salt and garlic powder. I didn't use as many potatoes but I almost doubled the amount of soup. Will definetly make again (hopefully on the grill next time lol). Thanks for the recipe!!",

I wraped 8 potatoes individually in Renolds new release foil(works great)! I sliced each potato in thin slices. I didn't use onions. I mixed in 1/2 tsp. minced garlic into soup. I spooned the soup in between each sliced piece of potato. I cut up 2 mushrooms per potato. Added salt and pepper sprinkled with cheddar cheese and put a couple slices of butter in each. I did have to use another can of soup(about half more) because my potatoes were large. A little more time consuming doing it this way but it was nice because they each had their own personal serving. Cooked on grill 1 hour. Big hit! Thanks Debbie! I will be making this alot!",

Only used a couple of potatoes and siced very thin but still used the whole can of soup. Add about 1/4 onion a handful of mushrooms dash of salt and some garlic powder. Mixed it all in large bowl then onto foil with pats of butter. Double wrapped in foil and cooked for one hour on grill. About 5 minutes before serving I openned up foil packet and threw on shredded chedder cheese to melt. They were creamy and delicious. Thanks!",

Also since I live in New England a grill is not handy in the winter. Cruisinbeck suggestions of baking the dish in the oven is excellent. I foiled the pan (top and bottom)and sprayed foil with cooking spray. Baked at 375 for about 60 minutes. Thanks Cruisinbeck for this suggetion otherwise it would not be until Spring before I tried this dish.",
