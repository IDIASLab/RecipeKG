I added Smoked Paprika to give it more of a smoky flavor and I went a bit lighter on the red pepper flakes as some of the reviewers suggested and it came out great. After storing it in a mason jar in the fridge overnight the flavors blended even better and the heat calmed down a bit. I use it to top off meatloaf on burgers with chicken and even in a salad dressing (combine with 2 parts paleo mayo 1/2 lemon juiced and 1 part BBQ sauce for creamy Russian dressing)!",

Nonetheless this is a very flavourful sauce. I used it as a dipping sauce and liked it. It was too spicy for the kids so had to tone it down by adding more broth and then followed the directions in the notes to cook it down more. Definitely worth using on a chicken or beef before cooking and use this to baste while cooking. Thanks sammyc14 for this bold recipe!",
