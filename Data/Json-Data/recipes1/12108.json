Also, I new the sauce would thicken but it does as it reduces so I used about 1 tsp. of corn starch mixed in a little water, then added to the sauce. It thicken up real fast without reducing too much! This was so good, better than restaurant fettuccine! I was very impressed considering how easy it was! This is a keeper!!",
