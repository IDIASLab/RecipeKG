I was very happy to come across this recipe, but there are some changes I make that truly make it a tasty dish:  1.  I use Abraham's diced proscuitto with juniper berries (available in most large grocery stores and peapod.com).  It has an incredible flavor and it's nice to have some of your work done for you.  I brown it first on its own.  I believe this is the 'key' to this dish!   2.  Then I add the onion to the proscuitto and cook for a few minutes.  I've also used green onions (scallions) and they've worked great with the recipe.  3.  Next I add a few cloves of chopped fresh garlic and fresh chopped grape (or Natures Sweet) tomatoes.   4.  Next I add a bit more olive oil and about a 1/4 cup jarred tomato sauce just to give it a little 'saucy-ness' (I know the Italian place I used to work at did this as well).  5.  I reserve about 1/4 cup of the hot cooking water from the pasta to thin out the sauce so that it can cover all the pasta.  6.  About a minute or two before I'm ready to combine the sauce with the pasta I add fresh chopped basil (a few leaves).  I use the white wine and pepper as well.  I've added grilled shrimp, chicken, and vegetables to the pasta.    Multo Bene!  Thanks for the recipe!",
