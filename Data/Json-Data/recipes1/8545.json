The trick I use to keep it creamy & tasty is to add a 10 3/4oz can of cream of mushroom soup (regular or reduced fat) mixed with 1 cup of milk. I haved used many different kinds of sausage (bulk italian, breakfast sausage, mild, spicy) and they all come out yummy. Serving with \"scoops\" (Fritos or Tostitos) or small deli bread seems to work best. I recently made this for my hubby to bring to a poker tournament, and he said that the guys were licking the dish, and asking him for the recipe! This also freezes well, so it's easy to make a double batch, freeze, then thaw & throw in a crock pot.",

I made this before as written and thought i was too salty. I just remade it now and I made some changes. I used a full pound of lean ground beef and eliminated the sausage. Then I used 2 cans of Rotel with green chili's instead of salsa and a large Velveeta loaf. It was amazing like that and way less salty and more flavorful. I will make this version a lot",
