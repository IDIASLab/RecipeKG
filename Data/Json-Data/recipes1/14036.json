I am rating this one a \"five\" with some minor changes. This recipe calls for 4 cups of flour, which is too much, leading to the \"tough, chewy\" texture that some reviewers are complaining about. Start with 3 cups of flour, 1 cup of broth and 2 eggs. The mixture will be a bit sticky, so I turn the dough onto a floured silpat (a silicone mat) and gently work in a bit more flour and then roll it out fairly thin. Then I use a pizza cutter to cut the sliders. Tonight I made the recipe more brothy, like chicken soup, but I've also made it thicker. My husband's family loves it over mashed potatoes---starch nirvana! I also like to add some dried herbs, a little garlic powder and a few bouillon cubes to the chicken while it is cooking for more flavor.",

The sliders are a little chewy I'm not sure if I did something wrong and it doesn't say how thin to roll out the dough so maybe I could roll it thinner next time.

Chicken served on the side instead of in the soup itself. At any rate - Still very good - excelent recipe!",
