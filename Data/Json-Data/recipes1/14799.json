Cooking with the dressing was interesting (although you can't really taste the dressing) as was the \"quick roasting \" which is essentially what happened in the skillet while it simmered. And while my husband and I liked the creaminess of the sauce we both agreed that it needed a lot more flavor. If I make this again I'll probably leave out the veggies (and serve a fresh salad on the side) and either simmer down the cooking liquid to use as a sauce (in the hopes of keeping the tang of the dressing) or if I do add the cream cheese at the end also add some dijon mustard or something else to give it some flavor.",
