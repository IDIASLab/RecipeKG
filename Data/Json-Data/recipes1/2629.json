This was just that good, and with none of that \"this is a cake mix\" taste. It seems most reviewers put their own spin on this recipe, as did I. I used yellow cake mix because that's what I had on hand, (but I've found French Vanilla makes a much better substitute for yellow cake mix in general), vanilla pudding, 1 tsp. orange extract, 1 tsp. vanilla, fresh orange juice and....one full tablespoon of orange zest! Since there seemed to be a great deal of disappointment with this cake not being very orange tasting, this full-flavored cake, as I made it anyway, is very definitely a prominent, fresh tasting orange. The glaze, too, is orangey, buttery good, and makes the cake all shiny and beautiful. I used a tube pan, but used the \"bottom\" of the cake for the top as I liked the imperfect and crackly look of it. This is just one outstanding, delicious and beautiful orange--yes ORANGE--cake. ",

I added orange zest to the batter but it still lacked the orange punch I was looking for. That said I would make it again & enjoy every piece.\nI would like to add my way of adding the glaze: After the cake has cooled\nI put the cake back into the cake pan & add the glaze to the bottom of the cake first. Glaze soaks into the bottom of the cake which traditionally never gets it. It soaks into the sides too. I then invert the cake onto a cake plate & glaze the top & sides.

First, I used a lemon cake mix instead of a yellow one to increase the citrus taste.  Then I used orange extract instead of lemon.  To really pump up the orange flavor, I added 3/4 of a packet of orange Kool-Ade unsweetened drink mix to the dry ingredients.  I put the other 1/4 packet in the glaze.  After the cake cooled, I put it back in the bundt pan and poked big holes in the bottom of the cake with a chopstick.  Then I poured most of the glaze over the bottom of the cake and let it soak in for about 20 minutes. I then inverted the cake onto a cake plate and drizzled the remainder of the glaze over the top.  This came out great; very orangey and saturated with glaze.  Delicious.",

I think next time I will use orange extract instead of the lemon for more of an orange flavor. Iam also going to try and make a glaze out of powdered sugar, orange juice and orange extract. The glaze in this recipe was more of a syrup that soaked into the cake instead of a glaze. Delicious none the less, but I will change a few things next time. This cake was moist and yummy!",

It's very moist and bursting with orange flavor - what more could you ask for from such a simple recipe! I did use vanilla pudding mix vs. lemon, 1 tsp of vanilla extract vs. lemon and to heighten the orange flavor added a 1 tsp. of orange extract and a Tbsp of orange zest. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing! This cake is perfect when you don't have time to make a scratch cake but want something that tastes like you did! It baked up perfectly and even though the recipe for the glaze could probably be cut in half it really does add to the cake. Once it was cooled, I couldn't resist drizzling some melted white chocolate over it for a bit of contrast and to take it over the top. Great recipe!",

This hardened the glaze somewhat, and it was excellent.  You definitely should bring it to a full boil, though, just like you would when making candy.  I will definitely make again.

                "reviewBody": "The ongoing theme with the comments on this recipe seems to be to change it... I definatly don't think it's a 5 star recipe 'as is'. I did the original first and it was too lemony. Moist, light- but definatly not predominantly orange. I was looking for a very fresh, very obviously orange cake so my next try was to follow the recommendation of all the other bakers who tried it their way. I subbed vanilla pudding for the lemon and orange extract in place of the lemon. I added 3 teaspoons of the orange instead of 1. I also used a french vanilla cake mix with it. NOW it's a 5 star recipe! Very fresh- the orange lingers in your mouth! I didn't do the bundt cake with the glaze. I filled it with a coconut cream and mandarin orange filling and frosted it in almond buttercream. AMAZING! P.S. Add a little orange gel food coloring to it. You wouldn't expect a strawberry cake to be white would you?",
