Our version also includes 1/2 c. of melted butter or margarine and 2 well-beaten eggs.  If anybody tried it Brandy's way and it came out too dry, try it our way.  I started making it when I joined the family 15 years ago.   It's so easy that kids can make it and have it come out great every time.  It's become one of my favorite comfort foods.  Moist and a little sweet and really yummy.",
