I think I ate four servings! (Note: I've made this a ton of times since my initial review and have been using chickpeas instead of nuts and omitting the eggs due to my kids' food allergies. So good!

I also added a bit more salt some crushed red pepper flakes and a lot of fresh ground black pepper to the vegetables as they were cooking so that the spicy taste combined with the veggies during cooking. I omitted the eggs and parsely because I didn't have them but it turned out great anyway! This is the first time I've cooked with brown rice and the nutty taste of the brown rice was really good. The chickpeas also really added nutrition and taste to the dish. Next time I'm going to saute some tofu with the onions which will only add to the healthiness. This was a definite thumbs up and I'm going to make this again and again.",

I was trying to get a brown rice dish for this main coarse and the 'pilaf' caught my eye. Normally I don't use rice as my wife is not a rice fan but I had made another pilaf a while back ( From Tase of Home )that she really liked so tried this one (with some changes as others had suggested). I used a 14 oz. can of beef broth and a 10.5 oz. can of Cambells French Onion Soup instead of the water and extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. I left out the carrots salt mushrooms ( wife doesn't like them) and the chickpeas. I added 2 roasted red peppers ( for color )cut up into 3/4\" pieces for the mushrooms and used a small can of corn in place of the chickpeas. also did not use soy sauce. Other than that I followed the cooking time exactly and the rice came out perfect. Wife said it was really good so you get 5 stars. And it went very well with the Liver dish. It is another keeper.",
