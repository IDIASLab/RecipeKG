After reading all the other reviews, here's what I did:  Prepare the foil sheets and dot with butter BEFORE putting the veggies inside (prevents burning and sticking); slice the potatoes and onion and mix together in a large bowl with olive oil, salt and pepper (careful of the pepper, I found that 1 tsp. was a bit too much); wrap it up tight, flatten it out and leave it on the grill for 30 minutes, turning halfway.  It came out perfect!  Thank you, Bob!",

My Suggestions: Use olive oil instead of butter, because it is healthier and adds a great flavor to the veggies. Add some cloves (or in our case, a whole bulb!) of garlic for added flavor. Don't worry about a pungent flavor; cooked garlic mellows beautifully. Add some fresh (or dried) herbs, such as *basil*, parsley, or dill. Salt and pepper to taste. Also, add other veggies. Don't be afraid to experiment! Grilled zucchini, carrots, and mushrooms are all wonderful. You really don't have to measure, just use as many veggies as you would like. This recipe, as is, is an excellent starting point for us veggie-lovers (such as me!!!)",

I quartered my onion and seperated the pieces.  Also I always add a sprinkling of celery salt and cayenne to potatoes of this style (a flavor must).  And of course added 2 whole cloves of garlic.  Also, like others I tossed the potatoes, onions and spices in a little olive oil before putting on foil, also lightly coated with oil.   No sticking and the potatoes were perfectly tender after 30 minutes on med heat.  YUM!",

They have come to be a sentimental favorite in our family! We always make them in one large foil packet or sometimes in a disposable foil tin. Dill and garlic salt are our favorite and tradional additions and sometimes I like to add a little bacon grease. If you let the potatoes cook long enough before stirring they will get all nice and crispy much like hash browns and everyone seems to want to dive into those crispy parts first!",
