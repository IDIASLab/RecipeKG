Made it exactly as written with 2 exceptions; I used 1 c. butter and substituted shortening for the 2nd cup (but only because it was for my daughter and she's not that crazy about butter) and I added a couple of tablespoons of cocoa to intensify the chocolate flavor. This recipe made PLENTY of frosting for my two 8-inch cakes and in fact I could've split the cakes and made 4 layers and still had enough. It spread easily and firmed up nicely in the fridge so I can tell it would be fine for piping. This is a keeper for me.",
