They came out great, but I found that the marinated made them slightly runny.  Next time I made them I placed them on a wire rack with a cookie sheet under it and broiled it for the same amount of time - about 5 minutes on both sides.  Came out fantastic!\nUpdate:  I've made these burgers so many times now, they're that good.  To add some extra flavour, chop 2-3 onions and saut\u00e9 them for at least 20 minutes on low heat with olive oil and butter.    Viola, caramelized onions, which taste AMAZING with these burgers.  One final note for those who didn't like the vinegar taste: a good balsamic is essential.  The cheap stuff (under 5 bucks) is gross and overpowering.  Buy a good bottle (you'll use less) and it tastes much sweeter.",

Just used a dish of olive oil, added a dash of salt and pepper and brushed it on.  I also did the same to 1/2\" thick cuts of onion and grilled them side by side (onions a little longer of course).  When they were both finished, I topped the mushroom with the thick cut onion and topped that with provilone.  What a surpise I am telling you.  Good luck and Thank you!",

He had to agree, these sandwiches give a burger a real run for its money! Grilled, carmelized onions are a nice addition, as is a slice of tomato and/or avocado. We like it topped with Gruyere, and have also used Brie to rave reviews. I have taken lately to adding a couple of spritzes of soy sauce to the marinade to increase the complexity of flavor, as well as to salt perfectly. I've also added a tsp of Dijon mustard, as well as a bit of chopped, fresh rosemary from the garden, both with tasty results. You can vary the marinade how ever you want. Easiest way to marinate (mess-free, too!) is to combine all ingredients in a ziplock. Replacing the balsamic with half the measure of rice wine, 1 Tb chopped, fresh ginger, a little brown sugar and 3 Tb soy sauce makes a nice Asian variation. For those who found the vinegar taste to be overwhelming, it could be that you left it to marinate too long. 10-15 minutes produces the best results. If the timing is right, then I'd suspect the brand of balsamic is the culprit. It's best to buy only genuine Modena balsamic. Granted, it will set you back a few bucks, but the results are incomparable. The flavor is robust, yet incomparably smooth, with none of the acidic sharpness you get with cheaper brands. Make sure you toast your bun, because those portobello caps are juicy. A+ meat alternative meal!",
