I halved the recipe (used 8x8 pan)  and used almost a full can of lemon pie filling, to which I added the juice and zest from half a lemon to freshen it up. Because I knew these would be a more delicate bar dessert, I used sliced almonds rather than chopped, and I was more than pleased with the modifications I made. Rich and buttery, refreshingly lemony, not too sweet, pretty and perfect little dessert.  ",

The second batch was incredible I am going to send a few packages to some restaurants in area to sell..... Thanks for the great recipe",
