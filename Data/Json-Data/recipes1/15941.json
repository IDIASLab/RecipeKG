Also add a few sprinkles of crushed red pepper flakes for color - doesn't really make it that spicy. I rub the flakes in the palms of my hands to crush a little more and release the flavors too. Be sure to buy the best mozzarella cheese you can find.",

I changed the recipe to flavor it up a bit: add extra basil (i actually used frozen!), a tiny bit of garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  I marinated this for about 30 minutes.  I also recommend using small balls of mozzarella, halving them and then skewering with a whole grape tomato.  Love this recipe... it is SO easy!  I will definitely be making it again!",

Tip for buying ingred:  ~25 grape tomatoes (Santa Sweets) per container, ~45 sm mozzarella balls per container, party picks come 50/pk.  I skewer tomatoe, basil/basil paste or no basil if without & mozz. I have marinated everything overnight & skewered or skewered with no seasoning to transport and take a small container of seasoning and drizzle over the plate before serving.  Drizzle Mediterrean dipping oil & you don't need anything else to season except maybe salt & cracked pepper or garlic if that's to your taste. Once skewered, they will stand up on a plate in a 3\" deep plastic container with a lid for taking or keeping in the fridge.  If you love the classic caprese or \"tomatoe salad\" at your favorite restaurant, you're going to be so happy to have found this recipe!",
