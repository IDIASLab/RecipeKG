Over time I have made the following changes: I begin by sauteing my carrot, onion, and celery until veggies are tender and onion opaque, I add at least 64 oz broth swanson reduced sodium, no MSG), I get that up to a rolling boil then add my meatballs gently.  Do not stir for several minutes and let them cook before turning down to a simmer. On the meatballs, I use only 1/2 lb ground meat, less breadcrumb, about 1/3 cup, and add parmesean cheese and finely chopped basil with the egg. I usually skip the chicken, and use the acini de pepe pasta. The spinich makes this thick and delicious. Add plenty of pepper. Wonderful!  Thanks, Chuck.",

Like some of the other folks, I adjusted a bit, used 1 large onion instead of 2, and that was PLENTY, used 1/2 sausage, and 1/2 ground beef for my meatballs, plus ITALIAN bread crumbs.  I also baked my meatballs in the oven until browned before adding to soup.  I did use the acini di pepe, which I boiled seperately, then added to stockpot.  Also, I used 12 cups of chicken stock, you really need it once you add all of those lovely veggies and stuff.  Once again, it was delicious, and thank the original maker for giving me a great base to play around with a bit, we will DEFINATELY be making this again.  ALSO, this is a very FILLING soup, a small salad and some crusty bread, and you have a great meal.",

(Next time I'll just get an extra can) I only used one lg onion.  \nI used italian bread crumbs in the meatballs.  I also cooked the orzo separately so it wouldn't cause the beautiful clear broth to become cloudy.  All in all I was very proud of this soup and my 12 year old ate spinach and loved it. :)  May substitute KALE next time.\n\nT. LeBlanc",

Be careful with the acini de pepe pasta it swells quite a bit and mine was a little thick I think about 3/4 cup of dry pasta is about right. Served with hot homemeade rolls and a glass of cabernet.
