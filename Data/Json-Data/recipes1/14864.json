It seems to be updated, calling for pasteurized eggs or egg substitute, but I'm not intimidated by raw eggs, so I just used four fresh, large eggs (and lived to tell about it without incident).  As you beat it, it gets fluffier and fluffier, as well as lighter in color.  For color and taste I thought an Oreo cookie crust might be even better, so I made a crust of 24 regular-size Oreo cookies and 1/4 cup melted butter.  Had I used a traditional pie crust I might have liked this with one more square of melted chocolate.  Very rich, so cut slices accordingly.  This is most likely why the French Silk Pie recipe I'm used to calls for half this amount of filling (and then of course you bury it under a couple inches of whipped cream). I garnished this with fresh whipped cream, raspberries, and mini chocolate chips.  And as it turned out, I found I actually do prefer the pie with the Oreo crust.",

My daughter said the first go, at full sugar, was too sweet. I cut it back and it still got raves. I'll have to try it at 1/2 cup and see what that does. Still an excellent pie.",

After adding the eggs this was much better. I used a pre-made Keebler shortbread pie crust. I didn't have any chocolate squares, so I melted 1 tbsp shortening with 3 tbsp cocoa for each oz. of chocolate. Update 1/22/12, I have made this pie several times and it is always amazing. I recently made it again and used egg substitute and it ruined my pie! They would not blend into the rest of the ingredients and it turned my filling into a cottage cheese like filling, wound up throwing it out! From here on out I will always use real eggs!!!",

                "reviewBody": "I have made this several times.  It is one of my husband's very favorite desserts.   I have tried it with a rolled out crust and with crumb crust and by far a chocolate cookie crust is best with this recipe.   I was amazed that this recipe didn't get all 5 stars.  It is smooth, silky and beyond description delicious.   I read the reviews here and on the Pillsbury site and I think the problems come from  substituting ingredients and from not following the order exactly.  Never use margarine and never use egg substitutes.  The chemistry won't work if you make substitutions.   Egg substitutes don't have yolks in them.    Yolks act as emulsifiers and yolks are what turn the granulated sugar into spun silk.   I also suspect that people aren't beating the mixture for a full 2 minutes between each egg which adds up to whole 8 minutes of beating.   I use my Kitchen Aid mixer and a timer.  I scrape my bowl down after each egg and after 2 eggs I take the beater out and carefully scraped down the bowl even more throughly.  It is the beating along with those yolks that make this pie perfectly silky.  If the filling is gritty then you probably didn't beat the batter enough between adding eggs enough or you substituted ingredients.   I used pasteurized shell eggs as suggested.  That is not the same as egg beaters!  You need real shell eggs not anything from a carton.  If you can't find them, I maintain that it is better to wash and dry your eggs because the contaminates are on the shell.",

Now take that mixture and put it in the fridge. That is what this recipe is other than a little cream and chocolate added. I would give zero stars if I could.",
