                "reviewBody": "Interesting concept but didn't work well at high altitude. It probably took nearly an hour to get the filling to thicken - and then only after I added another teaspoon of cornstarch. By the time it was thicker and I was filling the layers it turned to granules as it cooled in the pan! What a lumpy mess! And after burning my finger on the filling as it was spooned out of the pan there was no way I was going to attempt making a 7-minute frosting - another potential \"boiling\" fiasco too! I used the Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting recipe from this website and it worked just fine. At least it looked okay... The cake was actually very dry and crumbly. Cutting it was another story - with the rock-hard \"filling\" in between the layers it's nearly impossible to cut without a hammer and chisel. However it tastes okay. Just definitely not worth 5 stars!",
