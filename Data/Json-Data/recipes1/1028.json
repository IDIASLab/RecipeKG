Other cookies can pick up a slightly minty flavor from being close to them for too long. I know there aren't many reviews for this recipe but please take a chance on them - you won't be sorry! (Oh - and I've never come out with anywhere near 100 cookies from this recipe - probably closer to 3-4 dozen depending on size.)",
