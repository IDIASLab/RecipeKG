Most chinese restaraunts serve \"cream cheese wontons\" rather than actual \"crab rangoons\". If you're a fan of crab rangoons offered at these types of places (esp. buffets), cut the crab in 1/2, or even 3/4.  Also- crab rangoons take a LONG time to make- the prep, the \"stuffing\", and the frying, that doesn't mean they suck, it just means they take time!  I've sometimes used it as a conversation piece to a dinner party, while the guests are trickling in, I'm assembling them, and we all gather in the kitchen and talk while they're frying.  They're gobbled off the platter as fast as i can make them.  They're great with sweet and sour sauce.  Also- as the recipe says- this recipe makes 10 servings!  That's a lot of crab rangoon (which is NEVER a bad thing in my book!).  \r\n2 suggestions- if you want a smoother texture- use a food processor to finely chop the ingredients before mixing in the cream cheese.\r\nAND- for added flavor- green onion (or any finely chopped onion) and garlic also add good flavor.  \r\nThanks for a great recipe!",

Folded into envelopes so the mix didn't leak out.  Served with duck sauce.\r\nEdit:  I made them again today (12/04) and they turned out perfect! Here's what I did different:  Used fresh parsley, added 1 tsp. chopped green onion, 1 1/2 T. La Choy soy sauce (cause I think it's less salty), sprinkle of salt, pepper & garlic salt, grated fresh ginger on microplane, 1 & 1/2 pkgs of cream cheese, 12 oz. of real crab meat, and 1 lb. package of egg roll wraps, cut in 1/4.  My mixture came out perfect against the amount of wraps.  I folded into envelope shape, dabbed w/ water and froze extra between sheets of wax paper. As a side note, the egg roll wraps are in the produce area of your grocer and I found fresh crab meat in a foil pouch by my seafood area (I live in the Midwest).  My grocer said the crab is seasonal for the holidays... it it produced by Blue Star.  I stocked up on the crab since it's good for over a year.  Hope this helps everyone!",

After reading all the other reviews I made some of the adjustments that others had suggested (added garlic and replaced cilantro with green onions). I was kind of skeptical about if they would taste as good as the restaurants' but MAN OH MAN!!!! They are WONDERFUL. Even better than the local restaurants'. I love that I can freeze them and cook them up whenever I want. Hint though if you freeze them spray your pan with cooking spray or they tend to stick and end up with no bottoms!! Now if only I can find a really good recipe for the rest of the chinese dishes I like I will never have to pay restaurant prices!!!!",
