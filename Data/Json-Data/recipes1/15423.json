It came out as I expected it to, a coffee cake type cake that is not very sweet.\nIt did rise just fine for me, but I did make a mistake in prep that probably helped in that.  I halved the recipe but forgot to halve the yeast, so I put 2 pkts of yeast in 1/2 recipe.  I also separated the dough into 2 parts, flouring my hands as necessary to work the dough (dough is very wet).  I spread each half into a round cake pan to rise, then after they rose, put a layer of jam on top of one and set the second dough circle on top of the jam.  I know that is completely not how the original recipe is written, but it worked well and came out exactly as I had hoped - a not too sweet cake with a jam filling.  Without the jam filling, the cake by itself is almost more like a sweet bread.  It is quite good, though.  The author's description is accurate.",
