No problem getting the coconut to stick this time around, although I rolled half of them in coconut and half in granulated sugar to give my family some options. Oh - make these small (think bite size). Easy and YUMMY!",

I lined a large flat tupperware container with wax paper leaving enough on ends so I could lift it out easily and for step 3 shaped the mixture in the tuperware. Topped with the chopped chocolate chips. Let set in refrig. Lifted out the wax paper and then cut into small bars. Will need to figure out how to get the chocolate chips to stick better (others have commented they had the same issue with the coconut). Next time I might first line the bottom of the tupperware with 1/2 of the chocolate chips and place the remainder on the top.",

I picked up each ball and rolled it in my hand then put it in the coconut. Once I had 2 or 3 balls in there I shook the bag and then rolled it in my hands again.
