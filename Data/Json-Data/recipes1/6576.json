                "reviewBody": "I already had this basic recipe in my file but I needed to make a few changes. To start I doubled the recipe so that I could use a 10 cup tube pan instead of a loaf pan. I always make sure that my ingredients are room temperature before I start. This is very important in cake baking. I creamed the butter and sugar but I used unsalted butter and I used 2 1/2 sticks instead. I kept the sugar at three cups and I used seven large eggs separating the yolks adding them one at a time beating well after each addition. I put the egg whites in a glass bowl and set aside. Then I added the extracts to the mixture but I did something different. I like a very flavorful cake so I used one teaspoon each of orange lemon and almond extract and two teaspoons of vanilla extract and never ever use imitation. I just can't imagine baking a cake without some extract or other flavoring. I used cake flour instead of all purpose and I sifted it three times. Because I like to use unsalted butter I had to add 1/2 teaspoon salt plus 1/4 teaspoon baking soda to the flour. I split the flour into thirds and added it alternating with the sour cream. Then I beat the egg whies until stiff peaks were formed and folded them into the batter poured the batter into the tube pan and baked for about 90 minutes at 350 degrees. This cake was perfect and its a nice big cake. I simply love it and its moist too.",

I also use the traditional preparation method: cream the butter and sugar very well, a good few minutes, until light and fluffy.  Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add the flour and sour cream alternately in thirds, beginning and ending with the flour.  Set timer shorter than  designated baking time to guarantee a moist cake by not overbaking.  Delicious. On this occasion I used this batter for cupcakes - one recipe makes 12.  Make a double recipe for a Bundt or tube pan.",
