I added about 1 cup of half and half to compensate and then it wasn't chocolatey enough for me so I added some Special Dark syrup. I still felt like there was a little too much crunchy texture from the pudding so I heated the gelatin back to hot before adding it in as the last step. That helped a lot! The recipe was good in the end with a little fixing up but not a 5 star. My favorite recipe for mousse is richer with melted dark chocolate and this recipe pales in comparison to it so only 4 not 5.",

From reading one of the other reviews I cut down on the amount of rum used in the whipped topping. Instead of 2 teaspoons I only used half a teaspoon. I found the flavor just right. Also instead of chocolate curls I crushed Oreo cookies (minus the filling) and sprinkled that on top. Wonderful!!!",
