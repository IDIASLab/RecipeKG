Contrary to what someone else said, there was certainly enough to put in a 9 x 13 pan, all you have to do is press half the mixture into the bottom of the pan!! These were not too surgary or sweet, they were perfect, all you have to do is follow the instructions.\nI cut them into smaller 2-3 bite size pieces and EVERYONE loved them and asked for the recipe.  Don't change a thing! \nThanks for sharing, Mary!",

Also \"crumble the batter\" as opposed to \"spread the batter\" in the last step makes much more sense as spreading that kind of batter over melting chips and caramel is impossible! It's an A recipe and a family favorite!!",

If I make it again I would cut the butter from 1 and 1/2 stick to just one stick... and that might be too much, too.  The caramel/chocolate layer was yummy, though, and the dough, although cake-mix,tasted very homemade.... nobody knew otherwise.  Also, my preferance is a more cakey brownie and these were very flat and dense... which I know a lot of people like.  Even with the caramel/choc layer these were not too sweet, just too buttey.  3 stars because of the over-the-top butter taste.....",

I was going to make brownies when I realized I didn't have any eggs...this is a great recipe if you missing an ingredient! I also didn't have caramels but did have that caramel apple dip on hand. Worked great...I just plopped peices all over the 1st layer along with the chips and brownie mix. I will say that the brownie mix isn't really crumbly...its more smooth than the recipe states. But if you plop pieces of the brownie mix down too and wait a minute for it to melt slightly - you'll be able to smooth it into a nice 2nd layer.",
