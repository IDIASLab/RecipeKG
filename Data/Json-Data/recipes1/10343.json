I doubled the chile peppers and seasonings, wrapped the whole works in foil and cooked it in the crockpot for 8 hours on low. After the 8 hours was up I removed the foil package, dumped all the liquid into a bowl and skimmed the fat off the top and then shredded the meat and put it back into the crockpot with a small amount of the defatted liquid and cooked it for an additional 30 minutes or so. I served the shredded meat on warm flour tortillas with shredded monterey jack and cheddar cheese, sour cream and salsa. I made some Zatarain's Spanish Rice to serve on the side - it goes really good with this, especially if you add a can of diced tomatoes w/ peppers to the rice while it is cooking - and you could also put a little bit of the rice in the tortilla along with the meat if you wanted to - that's how my hubbie ate his! This was REALLY GOOD and I'll definitely be making it again!",

The second time I added a can of beef broth tripled the spices and added 3 chopped jalapenos. It was great. Served it with fresh tortillas with all the fixings cheese guacamole onions cilantro and beans. With my Oval crock-pot I turned the meat several times. I used frozen roast so the last couple of hours I turned it on high. Thanks for the great recipe. I will be using it many times!(Crock pot time approx 10 hours with frozen roast.)",

I've tried it a few ways, my favorite is to rub it down and throw it in the crock pot before I go to bed.  (no foil, no added liquid necessary)  I cook it on low 15 -20 hours.  Stick a big fork in there and stir it all around, it falls to pieces.  Then let it simmer in its own juices for a bit and - wahlah, dinner is served.  THANK YOU for this staple to our dinner rotation!!!",

I double the recipe and prepare it the same way, but put it in the crock pot with some water (to keep it from drying out).  Also, I have found that a tri-tip roast turns out the best.  Leftovers are great the next morning with scrambled eggs, salsa and flour tortillas (that is if you have any leftovers)!!!",

I added a few more shakes of all the spices and probably cooked it about 30 - 45 minutes longer. After the initial cooking was complete I shredded the meat effortlessly removed the foil put the meat into the juices and cooked it for about 45 more minutes in the oven occasionally stirring the meat around so it would all get 'juiced'. After that I ate them on some homeade fresh flour tortillas. It needed nothing extra. The flavor was wondeful. Since my wife is not a big fan of beef I had about a weeks worth of leftovers and they tasted better the older they were. Thanks Ronaldo! Great stuff! You should post more recipes. I'd try them.",
