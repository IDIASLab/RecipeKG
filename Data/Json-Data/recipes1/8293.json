                "reviewBody": "This is the best broccoli casserole!!!\r\nThere are some tips to make it better though if it turns out to dry for you.\r\n\r\n1. The best bowl to use is one of those round pyrex bowls with the lid. If you need more then just do another one in a separate bowl. These are the best because they aren't too deep and not too flat.\r\n\r\n2. Cook broccoli in pan just enough to thaw it, drain the water then spread brocolli between paper towels on countertop to dab up excess water. It should not be wet.\r\n\r\n3. After shredding the cheese, chill it. It's so much easier to handle if you do it this way.\r\n\r\n4. Layer broccoli and cheese. Cheese should be the last layer on top.\r\n\r\n5. Crush crackers pretty fine with maybe a few little chunky bits.\r\n\r\n6. Evenly coat butter, be careful not to pour, but drizzle it until all crumbs are evenly coated.\r\n\r\n7. It only needs to be in the oven 20 minutes or until top is golden brown.\r\n\r\nThis should have a nice crispy buttery taste on top and broccoli should be soft, tender, and very cheesy. It should not be dry at all Excellent.",

My family recipe uses the same ingredients but different instructions.  If you can't find two 10 oz packages of broccoli, use one 16 oz and 3/4 pound of cheese.  First cook the broccoli according to package directions then drain well.  Cube the cheese (velvetta works best).  Cubing is easier if you spray the knife with cooking spray.  Mix broccoli and cubed cheese then pour into a shallow casserole dish.  Melt butter or margarine and mix well with one roll of crushed round buttery crackers.  Spread over the broccoli and cheese.  Bake about 20 minutes.  Follow these preparation instructions and you will never have a dry casserole or need to add any additional butter, milk or melt the cheese first.  This is guaranteed to disappear quickly!",

I used up the cheese I had on hand (some extra sharp cheddar, and 1/2 a package of the shredded Sargento cheddar-blend).  I had townhouse crackers, so I put them in the chopper (to the delight of my 3-yr-old son!), and mixed them with a couple of tablespoons of melted butter before spreading atop the chopped broccoli & cheese mixture.  I baked it at 350 for about 35 mins.  It was DELICIOUS!!!  Will definitely make again.",

Then I take 1/2 the butter (apprx 4 TBLS) and cut the Velveeta into cubes and add both to the broccoli. Microwave again stirring occassionally so that it becomes a creamy broccoli and cheese mixture. Then I pour into the baking dish and mix the crushed crackers with the remaining melted butter and pour overall. Bake and viola! You've got yourself a GREAT side dish! You won't get any frozen bits and this microwave process speeds things up. I love it and only serve it on special occassions and holidays. GREAT RECIPE LEIGH!",

There are a couple of things that I do differently however the first being that I use a 1 LB. (16 oz) brick of velveeta cheese and secondly I slightly defrost the frozen broccoli and drain the excess water. I then separately melt the velveeta cheese with 1 T butter and once melted I stir it into the broccoli. The remaining butter (1-2 T) is melted and mixed with the crushed crackers which are then placed on top of the broccoli cheese mixture. The casserole is then baked until golden brown and bubbly.
