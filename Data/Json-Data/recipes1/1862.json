                "reviewBody": "The original recipe for Wacky Cake is from the 1940s when ingredients such as eggs were rationed and also because many people still did not have electric frigs and could not store dairy items for long. This made a nice dessert using ingredients one had on hand. This is my favorite cake recipe though we prefer powdered sugar (sometimes using a paper doily or a stencil to make a design on top) rather than icing. Another way we like this cake is to add 1/2 cup of pecans to the batter then once it is out of the oven to poke holes in the cake and squirt in a caramel sauce to make a type of turtle snack cake. An ice cream caramel sauce in a jar works well if you have limited time to make one from scratch. This cake is much more dense than other cake recipes but also very moist. It is also a great base recipe to experiment with additions to the batter or with different toppings. Do not over-bake or much of the moistness that makes this cake so good will be lost.",

Only changes are: I use 3/4 cup melted crisco instead of the butter and I use a different frosting. Important note: The cake does NOT taste good when it is slightly warm so even though you might be tempted to cut into it and steal a slice right away hold off. You will be grateful. I don't know whether it takes the cool down for the vinegar taste to go away or what but this is horrible when warm DIVINE when cool. The cake holds up really well to layering. I have been asked for this recipe so many times - my Mom would be proud!",

I sifted all the dry first then mixed up the wet ingredients together then made a well in the centre and it mixed up beautifully. I greased the pan and checked it after 29min and cooked another 4min. It tastes delicious just made it for my daughter's Birthday. It was loved by all. I couldn't imagine throwing the ingredients all in a pan and mixing it that way. It is so much easier to use a bowl and a liquid measure. I used butter. Ten tablespoons is a 150ml or a half cup plus a tablespoon and 2 teaspoons. Highly recommend this recipe.",

Just about everyone ate it including my daughter's friends my family etc. I did use veggie oil substitute instead of margarine but otherwise kept it the same. You can smell a little of the vinegar ( smells a bit odd) as this comes out of the oven but once it completely cools there is no strange aroma at all. Smells just like chocolate cake. I used my icing instead of the recipes because mine is loved by all my family. 2 cups icing sugar 2 cups real whipped cream and 1/3 cup cocoa whipped with electric beaters spread on cooled cake. After a night in the fridge the cake was a dead ringer for the type you buy at the supermarket slightly dense moist and chocolaty. Yep you guessed it. I'm making it again tonight. lol. I also mix it with an electric beater in a separate bowl first so there's no lumps and transfer to a lightly greased and lined pan. Thanks alot.",
