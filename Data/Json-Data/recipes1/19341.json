Using individual ramekins with crostini would make for a very elegant first course for the holidays. Thanks Chef John!",

I made the recipe using grape tomatoes rather than cherry tomatoes (the grocery store didn't have the latter) so next time I might increase the ratio of tomatoes to cheese if I use grape tomatoes again. My husband who tends to be hit and miss when it comes to goat cheese said twice that it was \"very nice\". (That's his \"speak\" for \"I loved this!\") I look forward to making this for company it's so easy and presents so well. GREAT post one of the best recipes I've come across on this site! UPDATE I usually make this on the same day that I make basil pesto as not many basil leaves are required for this recipe and if I don't plan to do something else with the basil it goes to waste. Today I inadvertently forgot to put some basil aside for this dish so I used a dollop of my freshly made pesto in place of the basil. I couldn't have imagined this recipe getting any better but it did! I think I may use pesto in place of basil from now on! So incredibly good!",
