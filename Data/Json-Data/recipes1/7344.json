First thing, I boiled the ribs w/ an extra 1/2c water and I added about 1/4c of that liquid from boiling the ribs and added it to the sauce; it gave it good extra flavor. Also, definitely double the sauce! The sauce has wonderful flavor and if you made it as written, it's not enough to cover the ribs fully.  Secondly, I used fennel instead of the star anise because that's what I had and it does make for a good substitute.  Thirdly, I used only 1/4c honey and I think if I used the full 1/2c it would have come out way too sweet.  The ribs itself also came out very tender and juicy! I think I will always cook my ribs this way regardless of what sauce I use on them!",

If you want leftovers I would do more. I also use a big stock pot for this. 2 - I use sweet onions. 3 - I also use sweet soy sauce. I usually use like half a cup of the sauce in the pot mixture and when I make the glaze I also use another half cup of sweet soy sauce. 4 - It doesn't tell you to add liquid to boil the ribs in. I usually add enough beef stock to cover the the ribs along with all the ingredients that it tells you to put into the pot. When the ribs meat start to flake when you put a fork in it then you are done. 5- I use white pepper instead of black pepper. I find that it isn't so strong. 6 - I find that the glaze is too little so I usually double it because after I take it out of the pot and put it on the cookie sheet which I wrap in foil. (Make it easier on yourself so that when you are done cooking you can just pull up the foil and toss it out). I baste the ribs good and cover with foil. In the last 10-15 mins of cooking I take the foil off and baste it again. 7 - Also when making the sauce taste it. If it's too sweet cut back on the soy sauce. Also you can add some rice vinegar to ease off some of the sweetness. I usually make the sauce in the last 20 mins before the meat is done.",

These would be great to take to a party cut into smaller slabs. A nice change from regular bbq ribs! Thanks Christine!!",
