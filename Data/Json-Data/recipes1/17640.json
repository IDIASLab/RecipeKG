It wasn't bland but It was \"mild\". If you are like me and need tons of flavor then add some extra spices otherwise the dish is delicious as is.",

I used Sangiovese wine to deglaze the pan (plus some more for flavor) & a 28 oz. can of 'crushed tomatoes with basil' in place of sauce. The grocery store was out of green peppers, so I used all red ones (sweeter anyway). It came out awesome!\nI served it over yellow, saffron rice. DON'T TRY IT! Although I love both, they don't \"play well together\". TOO MUCH! I'll save my yummy, yellow rice for less flavorful dishes & serve my Cacciatore over pasta or white/brown rice.\n\nTake 2: Tried this again, browning 2 S/B breasts, seasoned with S&P + Italian seasoning & 3 large cloves SLICED garlic (sweeter), in my smaller dutch oven. Removed breasts & deglazed pan with Cabernet Sovignon. Added: NO WATER; 2, 4 oz cans of mushrooms, drained (was out of fresh); 1, 8 oz can of tomato sauce; 3 T. chicken broth; more Cabernet; LOTS of white onion & NO WATER. Put breasts back in dutch oven with LOTS of thin-sliced red, yellow & orange mini-peppers on top. Cooked as instructed . Added halved grape tomatoes for the last 30 min. Served it over linguine with 'at-the-table' fresh-grated Parmesan. AWESOME!\nThis goes on my 'Go-To' list!\nThanks, Chef John!!!",

So I found this recipe and decided to give it a try...it was delicious!  And better than my memories!  I made two changes...\n1. I deglazed the pan using 1/2 cup white wine after I cooked the onions, mushrooms, garlic and spices.(instead of the water)  \n2.  Then I added one 28 oz can of diced tomatoes (instead of the tomato sauce)  \nThe end result was tender, juicy, chicken that falls off the bone, in a rich and flavorful sauce that goes perfect over pasta.
