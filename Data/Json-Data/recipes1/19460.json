I followed the recipe for the most part since my \"lobster\" was fully cooked that eliminated a step I also added mushrooms to the veggies and a dash of dry sherry to the sauce. Very rich very filling and very quick to put together. Next time I'll do it the right way and use real lobster and make my own crust but when in a hurry this fit the bill.

I made as written but substituted the lobster with precooked snow crab legs & precooked shrimp from the seafood counter at my grocer because it was much cheaper than buying lobster (and just as good in my opinion). Since my seafood was precooked it eliminated steps 2-4 which really saved on time! For the potato I used one medium sized red potato & left the skin on. I used skim milk & it still thickened up nicely. I used a frozen deep dish pie crust & put the pre-made refrigerated crust over the top. Oh I did use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to make this vegetarian for my daughter. This is absolutely fabulous!!! I also made the Chicken Pot Pie IX from this sight for my husband which has a 5 star rating with over 5400 reviews & this is just as good if you love seafood as I do!! Will make this often thank you for the post!!!",

I used the chicken stock as listed but enhanced it by adding clam juice and simmering with the lobster heads (I couldn't let them go to waste). I also added a splash of cognac used half-and-half for a slightly creamier texture and threw in fresh herbs right before pouring the mixture in the pie pan (you can use parsley thyme tarragon - whatever you like). When lobster season is over I'll try a seafood medley perhaps with scallops and shrimp. Thank you for the recipe!",
