Fantastic Recipe!\n\nMade a single batch to try it out exactly as it was printed.  \n\nSome Key Tricks I Used:\n**Make dough, and pop into refrigerator for about an hour--it makes cookies easier to scoop.\n**I used the smallest cookie scoop I had (approx 2 tsp) and levelled off the bottom (so I had exact size balls (With flattened ends!)\n**I scooped the first batch into the mini muffin tin...and while that batch baked, I scooped the rest of the dough onto a plate--that way I could quickly refill the pan once cooled (I have asked Santa for an extra pan for Christmas--It would be good to make more than 12 at a time!!!)\n**Freeze PB Cups, unwrap, then pop back into freezer--until cookies are out of oven.\n**Allow middles to \"sink\" a bit before adding the pb cup(should happen when removed from the oven after 8 minutes)  the \"sink\" will prevent the sides of the cookie from cracking.\n**ABSOLUTELY refrigerate the pan before removing cookies for cooling rack... BUT\n**Decorate with sprinkles BEFORE refrigerating pan--place decor quickly, as the chocolate will start to melt.  Shifting placement of the decorations will be tricky!\n**Once cooled...HIDE from husband, kids, neighbours...they disappear faster than you can make 'em!\n\nGreat recipe! \n",

I thought that they were not done at first, and was tempted to leave them in longer, but the cook time was perfect.\r\n\r\nLONGEVITY/FRESHNESS.  The cookies stayed fresh and soft for quite awhile in the cookie tins they were in.  \r\n\r\nOVERALL, an excellent recipe that I will be making and sharing every Christmas, for years to come!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Husband couldn't tell these cookies were 100% whole grain and gobbled them right up. I chilled the dough for a few hours and instead of forming balls I just used a medium cookie scoop to get uniform-sized rounded mounds in the fraction of the time. I dropped the mounds into regular muffin tins because that's all I had but they still came out looking great. I did have to cook them 3 min longer though because I made them larger than what the recipe called for. Don't make the mistake of cooking them too long (recipe is right on unless you make your cookies bigger). The dough should be soft when you take it out. The first time I made this I baked them too long (waited for them to turn golden) and they were dry.",
