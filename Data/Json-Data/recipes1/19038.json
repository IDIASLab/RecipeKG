I made the following substitutions to the dish based on what my family likes. I didn't have the Fiesta Cheese soup so I used Campbell's Cheddar Cheese soup and instead of the Cream of Chicken soup I used Cream of Potato. I added one medium diced yellow onion and for the buttery crackers (which I didn't have) I used Fresh Gourmet's Texas Toast Seasoned Croutons. I left everything else the same except I did not use any butter. Between the fat in the cheese and ham I couldn't justify the added artery clogging butter. The onion and croutons added some seasoning to what I think would have been a fairly bland dish.",
