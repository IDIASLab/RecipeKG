I recommend cutting all veges to a uniform size. I always find measuring certain vegetables by cup measurements is difficult. For those of you who can sympathize I added the following measurements: 3 Tbsp butter 2 cloves garlic 1 large potato 1/2 cup frozen peas 1/2 pound broccoli 4 carrots 3 zucchini 1 green pepper 1/2 cup-3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese. Following the recipe in this way provides approximately 4 servings. DELICIOUS!!",

I actually didn't have time to cut the fresh veges that I bought so I used a bag of frozen \"capri style\" veges (which contained carrots zucchini yellow squash & french green beans) I left out the green pepper (because of the green bean addition) & I managed to dice the potatoes chop the broccoli and add the frozen peas.

Maybe I should've taken that as a sign to use canned veggies (to save on as well as all the chopping time) b/c I felt like it was wasted on this bland side dish which BTW was part overdone mush part nowhere-near-done pebbles even after 30 min. I chopped everything to near uniform size as well as added onion and sadly we had to nuke everything in the microwave to have it ready w/ dinner which resulted in a buttery mess. I saved it to the best of my ability - w/ a heavy splash of Texas Pete. On the other hand my 3-year old gobbled her's up. If only I'd followed my 1st recipe instinct and just made a baked potato and done some simple steamed veggies on the side!",
