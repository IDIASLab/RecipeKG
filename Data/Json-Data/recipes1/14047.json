The pumpkin made it moist and cake-like not dry and crumbly making you want to choke like most cornbread I've had! I substituted 1/4c applesauce in for the oil and also used 1/4c whole wheat flour with 3/4c all-purpose flour. Would be great with butter but they were best eaten plain when they came out of the oven I didn't want to spoil the delicate pumpkin taste. These seem like they would even hold up to a sweeter chocolate-chip breakfast version (probably a cornbread sin of some sort though?)!",

I would have prefered them to be bit a little less sweet. next time I will probably cut the sugar in half. If you decide to try this recipe think cornbread rather than pumpkin pie. If you are after a spicier pumpkin pie type flavor it would probably be better to choose a different recipe. These are a nice accompaniment to soup or stew and would also be good for a nourishing not too sweet breakfast.",

Subtle pumpkin taste but that's what you want if you're having cornbread not pumpkin bread. BTW why add pumpkin bread spices to cornbread?! Just because there's pumpkin in it? Maybe those who did could add cornmeal to their pumpkin bread & like it better. Just sayin':D Almost 2T pumpkin per serving. Yeah! Vitamin A! Did mine at 425 for 15. Not dry at all - considering we're dealing with cornbread not cake - or pumpkin bread.:) Next day review: My cornbread lovin' boy (13) didn't like these. His cornbread nonlovin' sister (11) didn't either. Huh. Guess I'll try the pumpkin trick in the ususal recipes - Grandmother's buttermilk golden sweet or homesteader. Third day review: He now likes 'em. They moistened up & he wants these again. He thought I'd tried another recipe. There was that much of a change. Yeah Vitamin A (again)! 7.12 Tried w sweet potato & white sugar. Good too - & easier to mix w white. 'Made 12 muffs done in 20 min.",
