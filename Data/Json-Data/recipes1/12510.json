In a glass or dissolve 1 1/s teaspons of plain gelatin in cold waterin a micro waveable safe cup. Its going to congeal but dont worry. pop it in the microwave for 10 seconds and your good to go. I would mush the strawberries up with sugar and let them sit for at leat and hour. Next push the throuh a strainer. I have seen recipes with as much as 2 cups of sugar before. you can really youse any amount you whish.combine the liguid gelati whit the strawberries Beat your eggwhitesover a pot of boiling water.they should be stiff peaks. as soon as the eggwhite are warm to the touch remove them but keep mixing untill you get the stiff peaks. for 6 egg whites I would use like 3 teaspoons of sugar. Finally fold the strawberries into the whipped cream and fold the strawberry whipped cream with the eggwhites.refrigerate. That's how you make mousse",
