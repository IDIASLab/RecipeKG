Due to previous comments about dryness I increased the milk to 1 cup and mine seemed sufficiently moist. This recipe easily made a dozen for me. I doubled the topping ingredients per another reviewer's suggestion and was glad I did. However next time I'll omit the pecans from the topping. They became very \"roasted\" and had a burnt flavor and appearance which greatly detracted from the muffins. I'll just sprinkle the muffins with 1/4 cup brown sugar to give them a shiny appearance.",

Next time I will play with the leavening agents to see if I can get them to rise higher. Also there wasn't enough topping to top them generously. I would probably double the topping. Thanks for a great recipe Julie!",
