I had the same problem so next time I will put the batter in the fridge for a bit before baking them b/c it is more of a liquidy consistency and chilling it will make it easier to roll into balls. This cookie is so great b/c it is soft but not cakey. I slightly overcooked two batches but they are still pretty soft. It tastes like a chocolate chip cookie is supposed to taste. You got to try it so chill it if you chill it it will be easier to get it on the pan and also not flatten out so fast. this is a chewy cookie recipe and alton brown even said for chewie cookies chill them it helps the cooking process for this kind of cookie recipe and this mix has a great taste.",
