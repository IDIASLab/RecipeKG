I skipped the peeling step, though, and I patted the dough into rounds rather than rolling it out. It yeilds a crispy, biscuit like crust, and a soft, warm apple. (Braeburn, in my case.) I rubbed the cinnamon sugar mix over the inside of the dough before wrapping the apple in it, and used a bit of allspice, rather than nutmeg. I also stuffed them with golden raisins. They would be lovely with vanilla ice cream, but if you haven't got any, a cold glass of milk will do. Incidentally, if you scale it down to two servings like I did, you might want to double the sauce. ",
