This is indeed how it is made in mexico.. although in the states we are more used to browning the meat first and then adding packaged seasonings (which are always high in sodium). If possible, drain the meat really well and chill the broth. You will get the best separation of fat, broth and ...well...sludge. Toss the fat, gently scoop out the broth that has set up (kinda like jello) and toss the rest.  I returned all the chilled broth to meat and simmered it on med. high to reduce the amount of liquid.. there is no sense tossing all of that flavor infused broth that adds to much to the taste! Thanks for the great authentic recipe!  Love the flavor of this dish!",
