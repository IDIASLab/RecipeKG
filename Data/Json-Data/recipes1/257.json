I tried different amounts and settled on 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon. the kids in my daughter's class loved them and asked for seconds.  I will make these again and again with my kids.",

This is probably what caused other reviewers issues with the dough being crumbly and cracking, and also might be why the cookies flatten while they cook. I added a bit of water to the dough as I was rolling it out, but it was a pain to do. In the future I would probably try to cut the flour down to 5 cups and see if that works better. The dough is delicious though, and with a few modifications I bet these cookies would be spectacular.",
