I tried it over grits (which I love) and I struggled through dinner and didn't eat very much of it. My husband barely ate his. If you love spice you'll probably give it a higher rating than I did. I do have to say that the ham added a nice flavor to the recipe making it a little easier for me to eat as much as I did. Maybe I'll give it another try and leave out the jalapeno and cut down on the cajun spice.",
