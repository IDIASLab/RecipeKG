Since hubby and I don't really like cottage cheese I knew I'd have to take the suggestion of another reviewer and blend it in the magic bullet first. This was an excellent idea! I blended the cottage cheese and half the avocodo with the lemon juice and added real minced garlic. I then mashed up the other half of the avocado and added the onion and tomato for texture. We really enjoyed this recipe. I too added hot sauce cumin and juice from the jar of jalapenos for extra flavor.",

I left the cottage cheese whole (as directed) to help give this texture and am glad I did. By not pureeing I saved time and extra dishwashing. I also used fresh garlic rather than powdered. The only other change I would make next time is to add more jalape\u00f1o but that is just a personal spiciness choice. P.S. to this original review: I made this for a party and it was placed right next to a bowl of regular Guacamole. The regular bowl was empty and my bowl (this recipe) was still full by the time the party ended. I feel it was because the cottage cheese dilutes the avocado flavor and it's not the most attractive dish. On the upside the LOWFAT cottage cheese also dilutes the fat calories. Had to change my rating from 4 to 3 stars.",
