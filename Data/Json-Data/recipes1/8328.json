Don't tell them the ingredients till they've tasted it! Serve with potato chips, pretzels or your favorite vegetables. They'll be licking the bowl!  Note: you can add more or less of the anchovy paste and onion to suit your tastes.  If you like a thinner dip, add a little more milk.",

To each their own I say. I have been making an anchovy dip for 30 years that I use for steak preferably steak fondue. It includes all of the ingredients mentioned but only 1-8 oz pkg cream cheese up to 2 tablespoons anchovy paste (your preference) 1 tablespoon chives 1 tablespoon minced onion (I prefer green onion with their tops) 1 clove minced garlic a teaspoon lemon juice and a teaspoon of Worcestershire. There's no particular order just mix it up and let it chill to combine their wonderful flavors. This is a fun recipe in that you can add olives pimento chopped artichokes etc. I'm getting ready to make bacon wrapped stuffed jalapeno poppers with it. I'll bet it will be great but steak in my opinion is the best use of this dip by far. Oh and also don't be afraid to use the paste that is what makes the flavor so perfect and I would never eat anchovies any other way.",
