I change it a bit though; I reduce the Sour cream by 2 tablespoons use 2 large or even 3 medium size apples used 1/4 cup brown sugar and reduced the butter in the struesal to two heaping tablespoons. I also add a little brown sugar to the top of it. To keep the crust from burning I wrap the pie loosely in foil cutting open the top so steam can escape and the pie can bake evenly w/o a overly brown crust.",
