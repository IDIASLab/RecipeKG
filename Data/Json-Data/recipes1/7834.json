I've read all 84 + reviews and have learned the following additional options:  I can bake it in a muffin pan (bake only 15 minutes); I can cut back on my sugar to maybe a round 1/2-cup (or less).  I can add just a smidgen more salt.  I can add a 1/2 t. vanilla.  Add I can also add just a little bit more oil (so it's not quite so crumbly).  The next time I bake this for our gang, I'm going to add all of the above -- I'll be bold and daring!\r\n",

                "reviewBody": "This works as cornbread muffins, too!  I am not a huge fan of making cornbread as a round or square cake shape\u2026 they just are too messy that way.  Instead I like to pour the batter into muffin tins lined with cupcake/muffin papers.  This recipe works great as muffins.  I pour the batter almost to the very top of the paper liners then I bake this at 375 degrees, but I have a convection oven so the heat is usually 25 degrees less than the normal temperature\u2026 so you can cook it at the suggested heat of 400 degrees with a normal oven.  It takes 20-23 minutes for a toothpick to come out clean.  The tops are always nicely browned and the muffins are perfectly cooked.  The only other minor change I make is I use a medium grind cornmeal that is a little more course.  It makes the cornbread more like a true \u201ccomfort food\u201d.  If you don\u2019t like that extra crunch then use a finer grind.  EVERYONE loves this- it is always on request from my guests and family,  \u201cCan you make your special cornbread?\u201d  It only takes about 5 minutes if you use a stand mixer.  Very easy and very yummy!  People will love that you made this from scratch.  Oh yeah, and for you calorie nuts: I have calculated that if you make 12 muffins out of this batter, it runs about 180 calories per muffin or 2160 for the whole batch.",
