I called her with this recipe and she gave me the lowdown on what to do and what NOT to do:\r\n\r\n1. Prebake the bottom crust for about 10 minutes.\r\n2. Brown beef, onion and ADD some seasonings (we just added seasoned salt and fresh pepper).\r\n4. Then add sauerkraut (rinsed, drained, blotted) OR fresh cabbage that is shredded for coleslaw (as the original bierocks calls for fresh cabbage).  You will just need to cook it until softened.\r\n5. As for the 'binder' to keep the meat together some other reviewers had mentioned adding a can of creamed corn or cream of mushroom soup!  Yikes! This made my mother-in-law shudder at the thought.  Just sprinkle the beef mixture with 1-2 Tablespoons of flour and add 2/3 cup of water to make your own 'gravy'.\r\n6. Put the cheese ON the meat and NOT on top of the crust.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my hubby loved it and it satisfied his craving for the bierocks of his youth.  Great recipe. \r\n",

Just a few additions to spark it up though:Used 1/2 pound spicey pork sausage in place of the extra half pound ground beef; added extra half cup of Cheddar to the ground beef mix; added 2 cloves garlic, minced to ground beef mix; added 1 cup grated cabbage to ground beef mix (along with sauerkraut); and added 2T Dijon mustard to ground beef mix. You'll find that these changes really liven up this dish. I had no problems with the crust getting soggy. This is a quick, easy and stick-to-your-ribs dinner. Thanks for sharing.",

As the recipe is written the mixture just tastes like plain cooked hamburger. Next time I will use pepper garlic powder etc. but I think it needs something else to give it some kick. I'm not sure what that is - I'll have to experiment. By the way I served this with sour cream and applesauce. That's more a Russian thing than a German thing but it worked great with this and gave it more flavor.",

I baked the bottom layer of rolls for 15 minutes and it came out just right. Finally next time the cheese will go inside. It's just too heavy on top and too salty in conunction with the soup.

Finally I baked this in a 13 x 9 pyrex and the dough came out perfect though others have mentioned some probs with doughy-ness.

I also sprinkled the ground beef mixture with a few TBS of flour and 2/3 or so cup of water to make a gravy. I then prebaked the bottom crust for about 10 minutes while I was putting the meat together. After putting the beef into the crust I put the cheese over the meat then the top crust. It was delicous!
