As written it's somewhat bland; but I followed the suggestions below and doubled the curry powder and added a teaspoon of cumin (which proved to be just a little too much). Amazing! A dash of cayenne masks the offputting fishiness of chunk light tuna (i.e. the cheap stuff) and adds a nice bite. I'm sure it'd be even better with solid white albacore. Dicing the onions and peppers adds a nice texture. Definitely a keeper for great sandwiches during Lent.",

I fried some tomatoes in with the onion and garlic and added two tablespoons of brown sugar to cut the sourness of the sour cream a little.

I did make a few adjustments -- I doubled the amount of peppers, onions and garlic which I sauteed in 1 Tbsp. butter and 1 Tbsp. olive oil.  I then used the full cup of light sour cream, 2 pkgs. of white albacore tuna, 1 1/2 Tbsp. curry, 1/4 tsp. cumin, and then a dash or two of cayenne pepper.  We served the mixture over egg noodles.  Really good -- and again something different than your norm.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I used half the sour cream and stirred it till it was smooth and melty then added two and a half cups water and half a bag of egg noodles. I stirred it all together and brought it to a boil I let it simmer for about 8 minutes then served. It was like home-made tuna helper. I added a little more curry and also some lemon pepper for a little zing. It was wonderful! I will definately make it again...hopefully not two nights in a row though.:)",

In addition I didn't use 1/2 the sour cream as recommended in the reviews but near the end of cooking the curry I decided to make some rice so I think some of the soupy-ness of the curry (caused by using the full 1 cup of sour cream) evaporated while I was waiting for the rice to cook so it balanced things out. However if I were to make it again I would use 1/2 cup of sour cream. I've never really been a curry person at all but this didn't come out too spicy and tasted great esp. when served over rice!",

Didn't have bell peppers but I had an abundance of carrots; threw those in. Added an extra can of tuna 1 1/2 tbp curry some shakes of chili powder cayenne lemon pepper. Great idea with rice; had mine w/ garlic fried rice and tossed in some corn. Good complete meal and pretty easy. I'll definitely try it again.",
