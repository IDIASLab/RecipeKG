As an adult, wishing to please a liver-loving friend, I found this recipe and was amazed to really like it myself.  I searched the web for this recipe to no avail and finally found it in my collection.  It's so good, I had to share.  Mushrooms, onion, Monterey Jack cheese, sherry, and herbs add a wonderful balance.",
