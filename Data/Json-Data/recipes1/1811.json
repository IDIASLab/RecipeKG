Changes to the ingredients: She uses Crisco in lieu of the butter (a total of 2T. per pie) and more brown sugar 1/4 c. more than this recipe states. She also reserves more topping so it doesn't sink/absorb into the pie (1 cup). To prevent a runny pie she bakes it for 5 mins. at 400 then 25 mins. at 350. I hope this helps the runny/taste questions. Definitely a PA Dutch keeper.",
