Next time I'll try brushing with milk as another person suggested.\r\n\r\nTo freeze them, let cool after cooking and wrap in tinfoil.

My husband went to Michigan Tech in Houghton MI (UP), and he said \"they are as good as Verna's\"  Verna  was his fraternity's cook and would occasionally make pasties.  Obviously the people posting reviews lower than a 5 and complaining that they are \"bland\" have never had a pasty and don't know how they are supposed to taste!  These are not for dieters, and you will wreck them if you try to cut out the fat!  Run an extra mile or 2 and make them the way you are supposed to!  My husband and I agree that they need more than 1/2 c of rutabaga and fewer potatoes.  I did not use the MSG, and they were still awesome.  MSG is not needed. My husband says that Verna probably didn't even know what MSG was, and she knew how to cook pasties!  You won't be disappointed with this recipe if you are looking for a true pasty recipe. ",

I did make a few changes to include omitting the MSG and adding 1 tbsp of worcestershire instead.  I also used 1 lb of beef (97% lean) and 1.25 lb. of pork.  I didn't have the beef bouillon so I substituted with 1/4 cup of chicken broth and used 3 cups of potatoes and 3 cups of turnips diced (only because I didn't have rutabaga).  The last change was putting only 1 cup of filling in each pastie.  I ended up with 12 pasties half of which I froze.  They were great not to dry and not greasy.  Oh and for a golden color I coated the top of each pastie with egg white wash.  Next time I will devide the dough into 12 equal portions, form balls, and roll out until about 1/4 in thick. ",
