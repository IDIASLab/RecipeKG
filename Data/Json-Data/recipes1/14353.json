I used a dark chocolate cake and cream cheese frosting.  \n#4) Put this mixture in the refrigerator, covered, for at least 3 hours but I did it overnight and it was perfect.  \n#5) Using your hands, roll the balls bite size.  I used a foil covered cookie sheet because I was out of wax paper.  Wax paper is preferred.\n#6) Stick the balls in the freezer for an hour.\n#7) Melt up whatever chocolate you prefer (i buy my chocolate at a mennonite bulk foods store as I can't stand that melting bark stuff they sell at the grocery, yuck!!)\n8) Using a toothpick, pick up the balls and dip in the chocolate.  Using a second toothpick in the other hand help the ball slid off the toothpick.  NOTE:If your balls fall off the toothpick into the chocolate they are not frozen enough.  \n9) Place in refrigerator to set.\n10) Enjoy, these are SUPERB!!!!!!!! ",

I find it easier to dip if the prepared balls are refrigerated for about an hour, and dip them using an old Easter egg dye dipper instead of toothpicks (it wastes less chocolate and there is no fighting to get it off the toothpick).\r\n\r\nI am making smaller balls (half of the mellon baller) and made 26 dozen from 3 cakes.  One batch is with a white cake mix and mint chocolate chip icing and the other with a french vanilla cake with white chocolate almond icing; both dipped in chocolate confectioners coating.\r\n\r\nMy all time favorite though is red velvet with cream cheese icing and vanilla confectioners coating.",

I crumbled the cake right after it came out of the oven, so it was still quite hot, but I believe that is one of the things that make it really stick together. Also make sure you crumble it into tiny crumbs. Whenever I ran into a big chunk the ball refused to form and would only crumble. I then froze the balls solid before dipping. I melted the bark in a 4 cup Pyrex measuring cup, dropped one ball in at a time, lifted it out on a fork, and scraped it back onto the cold cookie sheet with another fork. They came out beautiful and by placing back on the cold cookie sheet, the chocolate hardened in about 15 seconds. I can't wait to share this recipe with all my family!",

It was divine. I had no problem with them holding together and I used my Pampered Chef scoop to make my balls uniform in size. I also used my egg seperator to dip them, it worked like a charm and the excess chocolate dripped right through. Betty Crocker makes a product called drizzlers, they are in a microwaveable pouch and come with a tip attached. I bought one of these in the white icing and after the chocolate dip dried, I drizzled the white all over and they were beautiful! I had little foil papers to put them in when they dried and they looked like they could have been made professionally! Well worth the time and effort!",

I read all the reviews and followed others' advice. 1) Trim off the edges of the cake to make it easier to crumble. 2) Mix in the frosting when the cake is still warm. You may only need half a container of frosting. 3) Use a cookie scoop to round your balls. 4) Freeze the balls for at least 2 hrs so they're firm enough to handle (plus it makes the chocolate dipping that much easier). 5) Use a skewer for dipping and since the balls are frozen the chocolate hardens pretty quickly. I've made german chocolate and chocolate mint versions (just add peppermint extract to the frosting). It was a hit with all my coworkers. Definitely a keeper!",

I put the icing in the micorwave for 25 seconds, (just long enough to soften it and not make it runny) to make it easier to stir in.  The cake was just the right for making balls.  My five year old DD even helped me make balls.  We got 54 balls out of our batch.  I put them in the freezer for about an hour before diping them in the chocolate.  When I melted I the choclate I only melted 3 squares of the almond bark at a time and i put about a tsp of shortening in it (very important).  I put a tooth pick in the cake ball dipped it in chocolate and then I left the tooth pick in util it dried and then i went back and filled the whole with choclate.  This recipe is definitly a keeper and I WILL be making it again.  Next time I'm going to try it with strawbery cake and iceing.. YUM!",

I used duncan hines devils food, and milk choc frosting.  I baked the cake ALL the way, let cool completely, crumbled in a big mixing bowl, and added only 1/2 of the frosting! that makes it less of a mush, and more cake like.  I mixed it with a fork, It will still look a little crumbly,but when you form balls they stick together.  I rolled them, and refrigerated them for an hour.  I melted a bag of semisweet choc chips with some shortening, and dipped the balls into it and set it to cool on a waxed paper surface.  Let cool completely and drizzled with white chocolate! yummy! you have to try them, they are a little time consuming but worth every bite!",

                "reviewBody": "YUM YUM YUM! I used strawberry cake mix with white frosing then dipped in dark chocolate. They taste very much like chocolate covered strawberries! As others have stated you must freeze these for at least one hour before trying to dip them. Also another trick for making the balls is to keep your hands slightly moist. I found that by doing this the mixture did not stick to my hands and forming the balls was much easier! I have been passing this recipe on to many people and plan to make these again soon.",

                "reviewBody": "I made mine look like mini cupcakes (melted chocolate in the bottom of the mold the ball on top then dip in chocolate after it sets). They looked really cute but were time consuming and as others have stated the texture of the cake is just such a turnoff. It feels like it's been pre-chewed or something. If someone can come up with a better cake recipe for the inside I'd love to try it again. I did not have any trouble making them into little balls - I used a mini ice cream scoop and rolled them to uniform sizes. UPDATE - I made these again for the 4th of July and only used about 2/3 of a can of the frosting. Wow what a difference. The cake still held together and was moist and dense but not gummy. It was not messy to work with and some people even thought it was fudge on the inside. I would say with this simple alteration it's now a 4 star recipe!",
