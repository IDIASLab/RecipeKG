The dough is very thick however, so be forwarned! I also baked it in a couple of bread pans and then since I didn't have three chose to make muffins out of the rest of the dough. I think they'll look great on my Christmas cookie trays (and will probably fool some people into trying them). \nI made mini-muffins which baked for about 22min. and regular muffin size which baked for about 30min. Personally, next time I will fill the mini-muffin tins fuller next time as they don't really rise and grease the top of the tin as well as the cups. Otherwise it turned out wonderfully. \nKeep in mind that fruitcakes should be completely cooled in their tins to retain moisture (which somebody had told me just a little earlier).",

I only made a couple changes, and none of those being fundamental. I used whiskey in place of the orange juice and I used less candied fruit and more dried fruits like dates and apricots and dried pineapple not candied. I also poured 1/4 cup whiskey over top before setting aside on the cold backporch to age a little. Everyone loved it..even my husband who is not a fruitcake person. I will make again and again. This is now my fruitcake recipe that I will use. Next year I will probably only use dried fruits and no candied. It makes for a more real flavor. Thank you for this recipe!!",

I also couldn't be bothered to wait for the fruit over night so i put it in the microwave for 8 minutes and this did the trick. Instead of using loaf pans i made a round one and it is absolutely huge everyone is very impressed! I havn't tried it as i've only just started feeding it but it turned out fantastically although it needs 3 hrs cooking this way. Thank you so much! We don't like dark fruit cake in our house but this balance as almost....well you could say saved christmas:D",

The cake was big hit and tasted amazing!",
