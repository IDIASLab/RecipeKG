We tossed this sauce with angel hair and seared portabellos. We added extra sea-salt and a dash of thyme which seemed to really round out the taste and give it a robust flavor without overpowering the mushrooms. Excellent. Worth the tiny bit of extra time it takes to make it.",

Prior to trying this I made a similar version without the block of tofu and came up with essentially the same thing.

That usually gives it a more flavorful and cheesy taste which my vegan husband and I love: )",

Also I added 3-4 packets of turbinado a little oregano and garlic salt to add to the flavor. It turned out amazing. My husband who is not a vegetarian had no idea that it was not a completely fattening and unhealthy cream sauce. It was wonderful with the pasta. I even surprised myself with how good it came out (I was a little concerned after looking at it in the blender!) -- who knew you could make an amazing cream sauce with tofu and soy milk!!!:)",
