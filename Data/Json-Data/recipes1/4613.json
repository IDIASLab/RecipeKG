These brownies are amazing and my coworkers insist that I bring them to every potluck!  The brownie part is super moist and dense (much different than a box mix!) and the mint cream is very flavorful without being overpowering.  Both the brownie part and the chocolate topping add a nice chocolate flavor without being too sweet (if you use semi-sweet chips in the chocolate topping) and are a perfect balance to the mint cream!",

It doesn't really taste like chocolate and is pretty bland and chewy in an odd way and tastes like if you bake a brownie mix with apple sauce and fake eggs instead of the real stuff. But of course there was all that fat in it so it's not fair!:o) BUT the mint part (I used 3 teaspoons of mint extract and a few drops of green food coloring) and the chocolate covering were excellent. Next time I'll just make a different brownie recipe but use the same topping. Also a bit of advice about the chocolate chips: I think they've changed the recipe for them because it is IMPOSSIBLE for me to melt chocolate chips in the microwave or on top of the stove without it seizing!!! Even if the water's not boiling or the power setting on the microwave is.1 and I check it every 5 seconds it still seizes up. It just doesn't make sense because when I was little I never had problems melting them. So what I did is get a big bowl of very warm water from the faucet (not so hot that it hurts to stick your hand in it) and put a little metal bowl with the chocolate chips and butter in the water and stirred it until it melted.",

If you are substituting mint extract use very little; start with 1/4 tsp with 2 T of milk to make it cream together.  Too much mint makes it taste like toothpaste!  Green food coloring gives it a minty look!",

It was even for St Patty's day and no store in my town carried it. I ended up using mint extract and the flavor just didn't do it for me. The idea is 5 starts but the hassle and end result warrant 3 in my book.",
