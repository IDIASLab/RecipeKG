With a few modifications it was quite good. First I took out the simmered vegetables so that they wouldn't get overdone and added them back after the onionmushrooms were done. Like other reviewers I also minced the garlic for flavor. I used 7 eggs (4 whole and 3 whites) extra sharp cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella and added some italian seasonings (oreganobasil)towards the end.",

Your instructions were not very clear that I should use an oven-safe iron skillet (which I don't have)...also I have made fritattas in the past and you scramble the eggs BEFORE putting it into the vegetables. Your instructions would make scrambled eggs not the light fluffy fritatta that I was looking for. I had to change this recipe on the fly to make it turn out half-way edible. Please improve upon your instructions...also there is a mention of butter in the steps but not in the ingredients...I am confused!?",

I only used 2 tablespoons of olive to simmer the zucchini and garlic and I used the other tablespoon to replace the tablespoon of butter used later in the receipe. I added scallions to the simmering zucchini and didn't bother to remove the garlic. Rather than whole milk mozzarella I used the part skim. The best was I added fresh sliced tomatos on the top and baked. Yummy!! My husband wants this dish again- he is taking left overs to work for lunch.",

Made a few changes since I was trying to clean out the fridge too: 1/2 low sodium chicken broth and 1/2 water for more flavor replaced bell pepper with 3 small Japanese eggplants and left out mushrooms (didn't have). Added freshly chopped parsley with the onion and sprinkled a handful on top right after it came out of the oven. Lastly crumbled blue cheese instead of using mozz. - this brought it over the top for me since I love strong cheeses and this didn't overpower the rest of the flavors.",
