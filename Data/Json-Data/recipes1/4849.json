It is great right out of the oven but tastes even better the second day. It really hits the spot when you have to have something sweet & rich. Would give it 10 stars if I could! I chopped the pecans up a little instead of using halves. Also I only had bittersweet chocolate (recipe calls for unsweetened) but it worked out jolly good!",

Next time I baked for an hour at 350 with foil over the edges for the last 30 minutes and it set up better without burning the edges. The flavor is wonderful, but next time I will try it with less butter and more sugar to make more of a true pecan pie with chocolate flavor. I think the 1/3 cup butter is just too much to allow the pie to set up properly.",

I mixed it long enough for the batter to rise and be smooth not really runny...when I stirred my pecans in like directed they sank straight to the bottom. So I ended up putting in more pecan halves and poked at them with a toothpick until they went just ever so slightly below the surface and then baked as directed. If I hadn't have done that then it would have looked like a Chocolate Pie with a pecan surprise at the bottom rather than looking like what it was supposed to be. Other than that like I said it tasted brilliant but the directions are lacking too much for me to give this a five star! If it was up to me I would mix until well beaten and smooth. Then I would pour pecan pieces in to just cover the batter followed by the remainder of the batter. I would then pour on the pecan halves and lightly poke them to just below surface level so that you can still see the pecans clearly and then bake. I will definitely use this recipe again!",
