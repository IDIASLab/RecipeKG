I have continued to use the two egg whites although I am not sure if it is necessary or not. I use 2 tsp. of water and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. They turn out wonderful. This is an outstanding recipe. I do make a slight change in the directions. I whip my egg whites in my 5 quart bowl from my Kitchen Aid Mixer. I add the pecans and stir. I then slowly add the sugar mixture right into the bowl with the pecans. I mix after each small addition of sugar. I find it mixes well this way. I have tried the ziploc bag method and find it is not necessary. All in one bowl works well for me. Another update as of 10/2009. I have continued to make these for parties and gifts. I get many requests for the recipe. In the past I always used sugar made from sugar beets. Recently I switched to buying sugar made from sugar cane. I have to say I prefer these made with sugar from sugar beets. It seems like the sugar from sugar cane melts more so the pecans look a bit different. They still taste okay, but I will be buying sugar from sugar beets again for this recipe.",

Does anyone know how long they will last?  Can they be frozen?  Thanks!  ** An update....the original recipe is the best for the most part...I tried it with vanilla...better with water.....also tried with brown sugar.....white is better.  Two things I did do....used 2 egg whites and almost twice as much cinnamon. I got so many requests for the recipe.  I will include these nuts in my baskets every year from now on.  Easy and soooo tasty!  Oh, and the kitchen smells wonderful while they are baking too...BTW, they freeze beautifully!",

If you\u2019re having a sticking problem, put 1 Tablespoon butter on a large baking sheet with sides. Place pan in the preheated oven to melt butter. Remove from oven and spread butter over entire bottom of pan. No need to drag out the Kitchen-Aid or use plastic bags, just wisk 1 large egg white and 1 Tablespoon of water until frothy, this is enough liquid to coat 1 pounds of nuts. Add the pecans to the egg white mixture and, using a rubber spatula, keep folding and stirring the pecans until completely coated. Add nuts to bowl with sugar mixture and again, using a rubber spatula, keep folding and stirring the pecans until completely coated. When the pecans are properly coated, there will be no sugar mixture left in the bowl. Be sure to spread pecans on the buttered baking sheet, in a single layer, and don\u2019t forget to stir every 15 minutes while baking. I bake mine at 300 degrees F for 1 hour and have never had a problem with the nuts burning. Let cool completely before storing in an airtight container and store at room temperature. Will last several weeks, if they aren\u2019t eaten before that!",

The first time I made these I followed the recipe (even though the majority of reviews suggested otherwise). They were awesome! I figured if they were that good without making the suggested changes, they would be even better if I made the suggested changes (adding an additional egg white, and using vanilla instead of water). Well, I was VERY disappointed. They turned out chewy, and more glazed, instead of having the crunchy sweet coating on them that I loved when I followed the recipe. Plus, I felt like the vanilla deterred from the yummy spice flavor of the cinnamon. So, I've now made them a 3rd time and have to tell you that they are so much better if you follow the recipe. I normally tweak recipes based upon the suggestions in reviews, and if you did the same and never tried them the way the recipe states you may be happy, but if you try them without making the changes they will be even better! The only change I will say that I think helps is adding more cinnamon. I doubled it up but I suggest leaving everything else the same. Don't add more egg whites, and don't substitute the vanilla!",
