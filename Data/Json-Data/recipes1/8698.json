I baked the crust in a 9 x 9\" glass dish. Then poured in the pudding mixes. I also added some peanut butter to the chocolate batter and then swirled the two together to make a marble like topping. Then I sprinkled the top with crushed peanuts. Mine came out a bit watery so I put it in the freezer for a couple hours. Wow! It came out like an amazing ice cream cake. I think next time though if I want to make it w/o freezing it I would simply stir in a pack of plain gelatin. I skipped the whipped topping.",
