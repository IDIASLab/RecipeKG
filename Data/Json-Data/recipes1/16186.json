I make it the classical way, I use about 1 lb. of tomatoes, 2 cloves of garlic and no onion, plus a good sized piece of stale bread soaked in cold water added to the veggies. That gives it more consistency and makes it a bit thicker. Another spanish variant called Sopa Marbella adds 2 or 3 carrots, giving it a nice slightly sweet taste.",
