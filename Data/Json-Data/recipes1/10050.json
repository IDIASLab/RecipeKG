A tip to cool the coffee mixture: partially fill sink with cold water; set pan in and stir until mixture cools (which it does quickly!)

I cut this cake into brownie-like pieces and removed them individually from the pan... made for a messy job but I didn't mind... all the more crumbs to pick at!:-) Next time I'll use less sugar and raisins and probably omit the allspice because I prefer a more intense coffee flavour and I found this to be rather sweet! Nevertheless great recipe and I WILL be making this again! Thanks!",
