They are difficult to peel but I figured out a good way. Cut the end off and slice down the length of the plantain. Then peel the cut edges apart. For this recipe it says gather about two tablespoons together...Squish them together into a little ball. They will stick together and still make the 'legs' of the aranita. Fast and easy!",

Make sure the plantains are very green or it will have a different texture and flavor. It is not supposed to be sweet. I always use the special grater I have to make homemade hash browns. What you want is similar to the way carrots are shredded for a salad. They were spectacular!!",
