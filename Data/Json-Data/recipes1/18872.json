        "description": "The Austrian emperor prior to the first World War ate Tafelspitz (boiled beef) for dinner every night. The boiling method yields itself to an inexpensive cut of beef, but I like to use a leaner cut of beef. The broth with the bones and vegetables has a depth of flavor worth the effort. The apple and horseradish sauce suits this beef beautifully. Serve with boiled vegetables. I like finger potatoes and baby carrots.",
