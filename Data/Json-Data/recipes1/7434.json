As we reminised about Christmases past when our mom made all the goodies, we just couldn't wait until it cooled. We began to just nibble at first, but then it turned to bigger and bigger bites. Before we knew it, it was all gone. Of course when the kids came in from making \"snow angels\" they got the whiff of something good. hehehehe They were so disappointed to find out it was all gone. Since it's a really super easy pie to make, we ended up making three more later that night. One for my sister, one for me & one for the rest of them. Somehow, though, they didn't think that was fair.(I still laugh thinking about it.)",

I have made it a few times and prefer the look and taste of this pie when just a pinch of nutmeg is sprinkled on top and not mixed in. Some cooks have complained that there is not enough filling. The recipe states it is a small 7\" pie! To make this recipe as a standard 9\" pie increase the ingredients by 50% making it 3 eggs 3 T. sugar and 1 7/8 cup milk. You might need to increase the last baking time slightly. Follow the instructions to heat the milk because it makes it bake more quickly and evenly. One of the nicest things about this version is the small amount of sugar which allows the custard flavor to come through well.",
