I used baby portabellas (criminis) and they add a wonderful flavor. I also used homemade pasta. The sauce is not very eye friendly (very off white looking) so next time I will either try adding brocoli asparagus or maybe just parseley to give it some contrasting color. I think serving this w/ a Pinot Noir would do justice.",
