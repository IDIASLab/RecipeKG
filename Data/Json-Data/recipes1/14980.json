I changed this recipe,  so the 5 star rating is because it is a good \"starting\" point, and this recipe can be changed to taste.  I added two packs of taco seasoning,  I doubled the cheese and added it after I cooked the beef and rice.  I also added a full can of corn, a 16 oz can of refried beans and a 16 oz can of diced tomatoes.   It tastes just like Taco Bell's Southwest bowl, and you could also make this using shredded chicken breast.  My husband had this mixture rolled up inside a burrito shell, and I topped mine with lettuce, sour cream and more cheddar.  It made a TON, and I will freeze the leftovers so we can have quick burritos in a few weeks.  We really enjoyed this.  : )",

As my husband is a vegetarian, we used veggie mince instead of ground beef. I cooked this is a packet of taco seasoning mix to give it added flavor. I used 3 cups of rice instead of 2 and waited until the rice was cooked before I added the cheese. I also added about a half a can of corn and a small can of sliced black olives. I added some medium salsa as well to brighten it up. It was great with tortilla chips! So easy! Will add this to our dinner rotation!!",

We put it in the drink cooler in a ziploc bag inside of a large brown bag and kept it from touching any ice. It stayed good until we got home. I tore up some iceberg lettuce and diced a tomato. We also added some doritos. We put some lettuce in the bottom of our bowls added the recipe mixture and the topped with more lettuce tomato Doritos and some ranch veggie dip we had on hand. This was so yummy and is a new favorite camp food. Thanks for an awesome simple to make recipe!!",
