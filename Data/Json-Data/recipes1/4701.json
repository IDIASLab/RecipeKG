Be sure to leave the pieces alone in the pan until they are nice and brown- don't move them around. You want all those brown bits in the bottom of the pan. I agree Sauvignon Blanc is the wine to use. I serve mine over cooked rice instead of potatoes. The end result is worth every minute of the prep time for this yummy meal.",

Taste testing as I went along I reduced by about 1/2 before adding the thickener hoping to correct the wine taste. Because I love tarragon so much (hmmm perhaps because it relates to dragon?) I will try again this time replacing 1/2 with either chicken or vegie stock.",

When I saw the review that said this recipe was bland I thought \"this might be the one\" because Tarragon is subtle. Used chicken breast strips butter and olive oil sauvignon blanc and by luck of draw had goat cheese on hand instead of sour cream. Used more tarragon than called for in the recipe and a little less wine. Didn't need any cornstarch. Great flavor! Served with yellow (dry) sweet potato and herbed green beans. Sweetness from onions offset well by tartness of wine and cheese - but not too strong so tarragon comes thru just fine. Also if you're using breast strips you don't need to cook as long - mine was done after simmering 25 min. Very quick and easy - will definitely make again - probably for company.",
