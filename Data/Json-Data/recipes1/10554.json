Because bulb fennel doesn't seem to be in season I used about 3 celery stalks & 2 tsps of crushed fennel seed. They also didn't have crimini mushrooms so I used baby portabella mushrooms instead. I also used 1/2 cup cream sherry instead of 1/4 and a bit more red bell pepper than the recipe calls for. Oh and no butter. Just olive oil.:) I can't wait for lunch tomorrow. (leftovers)",

The directions on what to do with the chicken are a little confusing. Your best bet is to sautee the chicken in a saucepan with butter onion garlic and a bit of sherry mix the other ingredients in a separate stock pot and build the soup from there. Also instead of soup base and water why not just use chicken stock so you can skip the water and avoid additives like msg? The broth was a bit bland at first so I added black pepper and red pepper flakes. Also instead of buttermilk AND half & half (which seems unnecessarily complicated) it might just be quicker to use heavy cream. Or just half & half. I also saw this question: Cream Sherry is a type of sweet sherry blend that is available in the booze aisle.",
