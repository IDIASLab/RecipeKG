I recommend putting your frozen peas into a bowl of cold water to thaw for about 20 minutes, drain well, then add to the onion/garlic saute mixture for just a couple minutes to heat through. This way, you'll avoid the wrinkly and mushy look of overcooked frozen peas, and the peas will stay a vibrant green color. The flavor of this dish is great and is a nice change from the same old blah peas. Thanks for sharing the recipe! :)",

These peas, however, me likey!  These were excellent, as well as quick/easy to prepare, made w/ingredients readily on hand at our house, and an added bonus...good for me!!  I cooked according to recipe, except I didn't measure oil (dash), onion (1/2 of one...looked like enough and it was, thought the whole onion would not have been too much either), or garlic (lots and lots of pre-minced).  I also panicked a little and added some extra broth because it didn't \"seem\" like enough (it would have been...that's what the recipe is for, moron).  One caveat, my peas ended a little on the mushy side because of my own timing....I tried to let them sit (covered still) while the rest of the meal caught up....so I recommend serving immediately.  Thanks for a great veggie side, easy enough for weeknights, but respectable enough for guests, too.",

I used a regular yellow onion and 1/2 of it would have been plenty. A whole Vidalia or other nicely flavored onion would be best as the is the predominant taste of this dish. Instead of the chicken broth I used a whole bouillon cube dissolved in 1/3 cup water and used the whole thing. Extra salt was not needed. Very nice easy and versatile side dish! Thanks!",
