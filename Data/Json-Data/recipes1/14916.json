I did use kosher salt and black peppered the meat before cooking.  I also trimmed alot of fat off the brisket. There was still plenty left to flavor it.  The sauce was good, but a bit sweet for my family's tastebuds. (I liked it though) 5 stars for my opinion, but gave it 4 because of the opinion of my bunch.  I will do it again...but with a different sauce. Also served with kaiser buns and aged swiss cheese slices.",

Of course it was leathery and inedible - reduce the cooking length too!. This is a 5 star recipe when done properly. I did add some chipotle and some hot cayenne sauce to counter the sweetness.",
