I decided to give this recipe a shot and add a photo/review as it was lacking both. The dough came together quite easily in my KA and I chilled the dough for a few hours. The dough was easy to work with though I found it best to grab some dough flatten it in my palm then wrap it around the Rollo pinching off any excess before rolling it into a smooth ball. These took 10 minutes for me and yielded 49 cookies for me. They were a hit with Mr. LTH's bandmates. THANKS for the recipe Pellie!",
