I tweaked it a bit by upping the shrimp portion (I never follow seafood recipes exactly especially since I live on the coast and am only minutes away from fresh Gulf seafood). I started with 4 pounds of medium/large heads-on shrimp which after peeling (and deveining of course) resulted in 8 cups shrimp. I then generously doubled everything else. I am so enamoured of this recipe that I am having a dinner party Wednesday night and am serving it. My sincerest thanks go to the wonderful woman who submitted this recipe. This will be a family favorite I'm sure!",

I omitted the breadcrumbs and the entire oven process. Instead I cooked the shrimp in the sauce for five minutes and then removed them from the heat. I used additional butter at the end instead of olive oil and I employed Lidia Bastianich's tip of cooking the pasta in the sauce for the last minute or two. (There was not enough sauce leftover for bread dipping but I could have added some pasta water to the sauce.) When I tasted the sauce by itself I thought the lemon and wine too overpowering but once the dish was put together and sprinkled with grated romano cheese it really was very good. I liked this recipe because it was quick for a weeknight dinner but I will be trying other scampi recipes before making this one again.",
