However, I found the first batch I tried to smell really great while baking but just tasting a little bland. I agree with some previous posts that added a lot more to it. I don't know why they gave such a high rating when they had to add so much to make it taste better. To my second batch, I added a tsp. vanilla to the eggs. I also added 1/2 c. brown sugar for that maple flavor, used a whole tsp of cinnamon and added 1/3 cup of cooled melted butter. It tasted a whole lot better and was gobbled up and gone in minutes. Everyone only picked at the first recipe and they went to waste.",

Be sure to wisk the egg white until it is VERY foamy.  Baking an extra 30 minutes increased the crunchiness!  It's important to use the correct size baking sheet for the amount of almonds - nuts should be single layer and just fill the pan - an old dark pan works best and I don't bother to spray it - I scrape up the extra sugar at end and throw it in with the nuts. After the first hour stir every 15 minutes and continue baking until the coating is dry.",

I have been making roasted almonds for a few years at X-mas time for my sisters who absolutely adore them, but I have never really liked them much.  This year I decided to tweak the recipe a bit, and I am very, very happy with the results, SUPER!  For one thing, I took into consideration other reviews and double the coating.  Secondly, I comined the sugar and water and placed them over a double broiler (low heat), as I never liked the grainy feel of the roasted nuts that I have made in the past.  After the sugar was almost completely dissolved, I removed it from the double broiler and added 4x the cinnamon, and 2x the salt and 1 tsp of almond extract.  After combining and baking per the recipe, I was astounded by how good these are.  My sisters, who loved the roasted nuts I made before, say that there is absolutely no comparison to these.  YUMMY!",

I also am a firm believer in easy and Reynolds non stick foil is perfect in this recipe! no mess and the nuts come off with ease after drying and hardening(YUM!) oddly enough I was looking for a recipe initially that was like the mall nuts--but found I LOVED this on pecans even better--thought maybe peanuts would be good--no dont try it not good on peanuts!",
