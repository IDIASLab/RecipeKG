Since I had 6 chicken breasts I stuck with the recipe required 2 cups of water which resulted in a good thick gravy. However I MIGHT reduce the water to 1 1/2 cups if I only make 4 breasts. Also next time I will not add the cheese until the last 15 minutes of cooking...I like my cheese creamy not brown and cooked hard to the chicken. Still the taste was there and we will make this again!",

Then I pounded out the chicken until it was really thin. Then I coated them in flour put cheese in the middle and rolled them up. I then put more cheese (cheddar mozzarella and parmesan) on top and put them in the oven. I only used 2 chicken breasts but cut them each in half to make 4 pieces. I only used one cup water and half a pack on onion soup but there WASN'T enough 'gravy'. I will definitley make this again but probably use 3/4 cup water and 3/4 pack of soup. 45 mins is a little too long too. Maybe 30-35 next time!! The boyfriend had NO complaints and my roomate got seconds! I love this recepie! VERY eay to make!",

We enjoyed this dish especially my husband but I don't know if I'll make it all that often. To make it healthier I used olive oil to brown the chicken in and used wheat germ as the 'flour' to dredge the chicken in which worked pretty well! I did appreciate the advice of others and added the cheese during the last 15 mins. of cooking. Also I added cubed red potatoes to the bottom of the baking dish before adding anything else. It made a complete meal and the potatoes came out fantastic.",
