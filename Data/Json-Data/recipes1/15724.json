This is not your average turkey wrap...it's definitely spicy but has a great smoky flavor from the turkey that perfectly compliments the creamy avocado and crisp veggies! I used Hellman's light mayo flour tortillas and added some tomato slices. Oh and to take this over the top I added some bacon - everything is better with bacon right? These were absolutely delicious. Just perfect with a side of kettle cooked chips a dill pickle and a tall glass of iced tea! Thanks for a great recipe messy_jessie!",
