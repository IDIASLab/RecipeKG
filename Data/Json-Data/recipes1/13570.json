I don't keep orange liqueur or vanilla beans on hand so I replaced those with vanilla and lemon extracts and it still turned out very tasty. I would not recommend baking only for 45 minutes. Even using ramekins we had to bake the full 60 minutes for them to set. The top may seem \"set\" after 45 minutes but the base could still be fluid. The eggs make this flan not as heavy as some of the richer flan recipes but subsequently it's not as smooth which is okay the flavor is still good.",
