If you're looking for rich peanut butter cookies you're in the wrong place but these are still very good. The only alteration is did was only use 1 cup 1/3 cup and about 2 tblsp of flour due to the comments about how crumbly they are. They flattened a little bit so if you really want balls then 1 and 2/3 cup flour would probably work. Melt in your mouth delicious!",
