I was having my father-in-law over for dinner and he loves chocolate so I thought this recipe sounded perfect. I followed the directions but it came out horrible- the \"cake\" completely fell apart when it came out of the pan. The frosting was easy to make so I had all of this frosting and cake crumbs. So my husband just mixed it all together and was going to eat it anyway. But it ended up tasting pretty bad. The cake was a very weird consistency and the frosting just tasted like gooey brown sugar. Sorry to be negative but this cake sadly did not turn out...",
