I'll be the 1st one to tell you the thought of stewed tomatoes and oatmeal was sort of a put off. And that's the issue at hand. The sound of it. But she called me out and made a great point about that. So I looked at the recipe again. And decided...since she threw down the \"mental thinking\" thing. That was it. I was totally sure I had all the ingredients and I did. I didn't put a fine chop on the onions(wished I did) crushed fresh garlic and did the low cal butter and the stewed tomatoes I had on hand was italian style(wished it was smaller chunks) and my oats were extra thick rolled oats(don't know if there is a difference) And above all. Good recipe. Seriously good it's a total 4 in my book I have to say I think I burnt some of the oats because that was new to me(toasting over the stove). My oldest said it was really really good. I can see me making again. Possibly adding a few veggies or adding the oats in place of barley in other recipes by using the technique in this recipe. Surprisingly I no longer thing of oatmeal as a sweet dish in a bowl. This opened my eyes. Thanks barb (=",
