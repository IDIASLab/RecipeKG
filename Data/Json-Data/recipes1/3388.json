I think that the reason some of the reviewers' cakes did not turn out is because of too much water.  It says in the recipe to follow the directions on the box, but to use 4 cups of water.  The directions on the box says 2 cups.  I used 2 cups and it worked perfectly.  I highly reccomend this to people who don't like a rich cake.  It is light and fluffy, perfect for a summer day!",

As soon as the cakes were done, I poked holes in the tops with a fork about 1 inch apart. Then I slowly poured 1 box of strawberry jello (following the directions on the box) over the top of the cakes while both were sill warm. Divide the jello between the cakes. Then topped with cool whip and strawberries and chill for 1 hour. It turned out delicious and pretty. Very easy and inexpensive to make. Thanks for the recipe. I will definatly make this a favorite!!",

A huge hit with everyone in my family!",
