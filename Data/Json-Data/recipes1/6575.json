I saute some garlic in olive oil add the diced tomatoes salt pepper some of the basil and let it cook for a few minutes (not too long). Then I toss penne with the tomatoes garlic and basil and add the remaining basil. It is a great summer pasta dish using fresh ingredients from the garden. I just made it again last night!",
