For the most part, I prepared this dish as directed, but made some minor changes.  I steamed some broccoli and added to the recipe when I did the chicken.  After I poured the mixture into the oven proof dish, I added a layer of grated cheese, a layer of breadcrumbs and then a few pats of butter over the top.  I also increased the cook time to 30 minutes to make sure it was nice and hot and just let the ingredients simmer well.  I served it over Angel Hair Pasta and it was loved by the entire family.  My husband took the left overs to work then next day.  I will definetly be making this one again.",

I made a few changes: first prior to putting on the cracker crumb topping I sprinkled some sharp cheddar cheese. Then I sprinkled on the remaining cracker crumbs. I sprinkled on a handful of canned plain bread crumbs too to make sure it would get crispy and not mushy. Lastly I dotted some butter on top to make it turn golden brown. I had to add about 5-10 minutes on to the cooking time to brown the bread crumbs. I served this over egg noodles (as this tastes a lot like a chicken stroganoff) and steamed asparagus. Delicious my boyfriend loved it (he ate it 3 times in two days) which means I'll definitely be making it again!",

When this mixture becomes smooth pour over the chicken. Then put stuffing mixture on top. Cook on 350 for 1 hour. You will love this. My husband could not get enough.Serve with noodles and biscuits.

I tasted the fat and dairy from the sour cream and cream cheese more than anything. I felt it was very heavy and drowned out any flavor that could have been present in the chicken or soup. The crackers became soggy and did not add texture to the casserole. I added canned mushrooms tarragon poultry seasoning and pepper and that didn't help matters. I agree that this is a very fatty dish. It was very easy to make but I don't think I'll make this again.",
