Chinese 5 Spice can be a bit over-powering, so I followed the recipe's recommended marinading time of two hours, and I actually thought it was sufficient. I decided to cook the chicken on the Foreman grill as baked chicken can sometimes turn out a bit dry and leathery. I served it with sesame noodles, and a spring roll. Not bad at all. Thanks!",
