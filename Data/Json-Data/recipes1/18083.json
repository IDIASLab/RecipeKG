The leeks really absorb and retain the flavor of the wine and butter, and the sauce was just the right amount of 'creamy'.  I used spinach pasta noodles instead of regular spaghetti, and served it with a side of garlic asparagus, and my boyfriend and I both loved it.  I can't believe nobody else has rated this recipe yet!  Will definitely be making it again.",

I watched the video just before making it gave me great confidence. (I even donned an apron and sipped on wine whilst making). Made it a second time and added a few other left over veggies and some capers. This is an easy 30 minute or less meal. Addendum: I made this again tonight. Fabulous other than I forgot my own advice to cut back on the lemon. Halve the amount folks. Yummy and easy recipe. Again thanks Chef John!!!",

Update: I've made this a second time and have to say that I think it's key to use the creme fraiche and a good white wine that you enjoy drinking. Here in BC the creme fraiche is available in Save On Foods and is produced by Liberte. It's a little tough to find on the shelf though. I love lemon and considered adding the whole lemon...glad I didn't because the flavor is just right as is. I used basil rather than cilantro but think that fresh dill would work well too. I also think you could substitute shrimp and/or scallops for the salmon. Once again this was a delicious meal!",
