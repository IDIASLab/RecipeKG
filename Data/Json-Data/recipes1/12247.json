This is a pretty good basis for my ultimate smoothie though:)",

Adding all those ice cubes only watered down the flavor as well. It was nice however to find a smoothie that didn t have the tang of yogurt and for that alone I ll rate this four stars. It s easy enough to cut back on the ice cubes or to not add it at all if your fruit is frozen.",
