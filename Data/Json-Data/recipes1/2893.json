                "reviewBody": "After taking a while to review all of the carrot cake recipes on this site and others, I finally decided on this one but made a few adjustments that made the cake come out absolutely perfect.  I would give the one I ended up making 5+ stars, but since I had to change this recipe a little I only gave this recipe a 4.  Anyway, to change it, I added 1 tsp of baking powder in addition to the 1 tsp baking soda (so many other recipes called for both).  I cut down the oil to 1 cup and it was still wonderfully moist.  I used a 1-pound bag of carrots to grate and it was roughly the 3 cups that was suggested and I omitted the walnuts (I don't care for nuts in cakes as they take away from the moist texture, in my opinion).  I baked it in two 9-inch round pans at 325 in my convection oven for only 35 minutes and they came out perfect.  If using convection I wouldn't go any more than 35 minutes before checking it.  And I used the cream cheese frosting II recipe on this website vs. the one in this recipe because I thought that it was way too much sugar as opposed to cream cheese.  One more thing that I think made mine really yummy-- I used Pampered Chef's Korintje Cinnamon spice for the 2 tsp cinnamon and it gave it such a true cinnamon taste.  Edited 10 years later:  This, with the above modifications, is still my favorite and most-requested cake to make.  I make it every year for Easter and birthday's and it's everyone's favorite.  Great in cupcake form, too!",

Second, 1 1/2 c. of oil is too much, even for a southern cook. You could easily cut out 1/4 or 1/2 c. of oil and still have an incredibly moist cake. I cannot comment on the frosting, since I used cream cheese frosting II from this site instead. With these changes, this recipe is probably five stars. Tip: 1 lb. of carrots equals about 3 c. shredded. Also, I liked this as a layer cake. Next time, I will probably make three layers, rather than two.",

I was surprised the recipe did not call for baking powder, but prepared it exactly as written anyway. It seems I was correct, because the cake was too heavy and flat. The flavor was very good, so I WILL be trying this again, but adding at least a tablespoon of baking powder. As a sidenote, I followed other reviewers advice, and made the \"Cream Cheese Frosting II\" recipe. It was EXCELLENT, and I gave it five stars!!",

I also used a thicker cream cheese frosting that I had seen on this site.  Turned out marvalous.  She loved it and so did my other co workers, there was hardly any left for her to take home.  This was the first from scratch cake I have ever made.  Will definatly be making this again.  It was just so easy.",

I reduced the oil by 1/2 a cup, added 1/2 cup of natural applesauce, and omitted the walnuts, as neither of us like them.  I used my Ninja to make the carrot really small (personal preference) instead of just grating.  I opted to cook in a 9x13 pan at 340 for an hour.  Next time I might add more cinnamon, but that's mostly because I like cinnamon and also to play with recipes, lol.\n\nThe frosting is another story.  I made the recipe version and quickly realized I'd just made a yummy glaze (probably great on a bundt/tube cake), but not a frosting, so I started over with the Cream Cheese II Frosting (minus 1 cup sugar), which was much better, especially when storing the whole thing in the 'fridge, which is how we like carrot cake.",
