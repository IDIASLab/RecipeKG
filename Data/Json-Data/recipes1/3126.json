I also start the night before, by soaking the raisins and dates in the brandy.  It kind of plumps them up.  Then I use the leftover soaking liquid to brush the bread with.",

I made it often and have never been able to find the recipe again until now.  Mine came originally from the Detroit News circa early 1980's late 1970's.  It was called cherry nut fruitcake and my family loved it.  Happy to find it again.  I am put off a bit by the photo that accompanies this recipe, it looks awful and this fruit cake is gorgeous!",
