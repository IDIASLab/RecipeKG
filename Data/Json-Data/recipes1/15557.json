Thsi is absolutely the best gumbo recipe I have made and actually the only time that I have used a recipe for years.  My husband loved it and he is a true cajun.  Don't leave anything out.  Since I don't like to stand a long time with the roux, I have started using Savoie's Real Cajun Roux, it is a dry browned flour and comes in a pint jar.  You cannot tell the difference from the roux that you make yourself.  I wish I would have had it years ago.  Anyone that wants a real southern cajun gumbo, just has to make this one.",
