The chocolate comes out more chunky, where it needs to be smoother for better coverage. The best way to melt your peanut butter/chocolate mixture is to use a double boiler. If you don't have one, you can make one by filling a medium sized saucepan about halfway with water and placing a small saucepan into it with your pb/choc/butter. Turn the heat on low and stir continuously. The chocolate turns out perfect every time but be sure not to get water in your chocolate... it's very hard to fix although it can be done (yes, I've done this one time..  oops!).\n\nSecondly, because I used the \"microwave method\" there was NOT enough chocolate mixture to coat the cereal completely (I definitely have chocolate standards). I made up more, finishing my bag of chocolate chips, still not satisfied. I cannot recall if I used this exact recipe with a home made double boiler... I will definitely try again but never use the microwave again. \n\nI always make more chocolate mixture than the recipe calls for, it's worth it. I always say find a recipe and eyeball it.\n\nEven with an excess amount of powdered sugar (I don't measure this either, I dump about a half a bag into a doubled up paper bag and shake it like a Polaroid picture. If it's not fully coated, I add more. Also, I move them around by hand so I don't get \"clumps\" of cereal.) I ",

I only needed to microwave 15 seconds the second time before everything was smooth. I used a rubber scraper to stir the chocolate and chex together carefully folding it in so as not to crush the cereal. Keep on stirring until the cereal is coated evenly with chocolate. Just like we did when I was a kid we dumped the powdered sugar into a paper grocery bag and added the cereal to that. We then took the bag outside and shook shook shook it. A little powdered sugar leaks out of the seams of the bag so that is why we do it outside. Perfect. Will go great with my son's 1st \"puppy-themed\" birthday party:)",
