It always comes out tasting great and as for presentation, well let's just say it gets lots of \"OOhs & Aahs\"... Especially when you serve it to someone who's not heard of it before. I would strongly suggest cooking it in the 10 inch glass pyrex pie plate rather than changing it up to a 9 x 13 baking pan. This was the original way it was intended and though I have tried it both ways, I think the \"Pie\" version makes for a better presentation. Add this one to your archives; I doubt you'll be disappointed.",

I don't like the texture of cottage cheese, and didn't have any ricotta, so I put the cottage cheese in a food processor and mixed it with some dried basil, garlic powder and a pinch of salt until it was smooth. I used frozen cocktail meatballs instead of ground beef and a jar of Ragu. I cooked it for about 35 minutes. Everyone enjoyed it and it was very simple!!",

                "reviewBody": "Excellent flavor! As a second-generation Italian, I believe fervently in the virtues of ricotta in Italian dishes. After all, cottage cheese doesn't exist in Italy. Now, having made this with ricotta, as well as cottage cheese, I can assert that the cottage cheese makes for a better dish! We like the slight tang that's absent in ricotta, which is  quite bland. After all, spaghetti pie isn't a genuine Italian dish - it's an American invention, so it's best not to apply preconceived notions to it. The one objection I had to overcome is that the  cottage cheese isn't aesthetically pleasing. In the short baking time given, it can't melt enough to get rid of the curds. You know right away that cottage cheese was used when you cut it. For some, that might be off-putting. But that little problem can be overcome with one additional, simple step. Process the cottage cheese in the food processor for a minute before adding it to the recipe. This way, you'll get that intriguing, tasty result, and your plate won't be covered in unsightly curds. Additionally, I've made this as a meatless meal, as well, using only a chunky, homemade tomato sauce, and layered it with mushrooms and spinach.  I used homemade spinach pasta for that one. Great presentation! Be sure to cook your spaghetti in salted water (or add some salt when you mix it with the eggs/butter/Parmesan) to avoid blandness. Fantastic any way you choose to serve it up. But give the pureed cottage cheese a try - you won't regret it!",

Better than what I used to make according to my DH. I used lean ground turkey instead of the beef. I doubled the recipe and cooked in a 9x13 pan because we wanted leftovers. I seasoned the turkey with a little seasoned salt while it was cooking with the garlic onion and tomato to add flavor. I used store- brand jarred spaghetti sauce instead of the canned tomatoes & paste and added 1/2 of a 4-ounce can of tomato sauce to spaghetti sauce while it was cooking so it wouldn't be too dry. I also seasoned it with a little oregano and crushed red pepper. The only other thing I changed was to use 3 eggs instead of 4 (the doubled amount) in the noodle mixture and I blended the cottage cheese in the blender so there weren't any large curds because DH doesn't like cottage cheese. I also cooked it for about 30 minutes before adding the cheese. It may be because my oven doesn t get hot enough Overall great recipe!",
