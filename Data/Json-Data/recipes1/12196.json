I halved the recipe, but doubled the raspberries so that I could use the entire package, and Hubs and I agree the 2:1 ratio of rhubarb to raspberries is a good one, at least for our tastes.  I had to play around with this a little to find the right-sized dish.  It's really too thin in the size the recipe calls for and looks rather skimpy.  But if you use a smaller dish the topping then becomes too thick!  I guess I'd say to use what suits you best.   What I ended up with was a rather shallow dessert that definitely was more attractive in individual serving dishes than it was in the baking dish, but ohhhhh was it good.  Hubs might disagree with me on this point as he prefers his cold (yuk!) and plain, but I definitely think because of its tartness it's best warm with either whipped cream or ice cream to mellow it out.",

I cut the sugar in half b/c I added very ripe, fragrant strawberries and blueberries instead of raspberries.  I still found it VERY sweet.  I probably could've added a third or quarter of the white sugar.  I didn't have instant tapioca so I added 3 tablespoons of cornstarch, which turned out to be the perfect consistency.  I modified the topping, doubling everything except the butter, which was a mistake.  You need the butter in the topping to really make it crisp.  Mine turned out kinda of soggy where there wasn't a pea-sized chunk of butter, b/c I guess the dry ingredients without sufficient butter would just \"dissolve\" into the wet filling.  Tasted delicious, but didn't have the contrasting crunch texture from the sweet filling.  I also added cinnamon to the topping, but I didn't really taste it.",
