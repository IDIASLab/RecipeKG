I doubt I'll ever fix it again.  The cabbage was too overcooked and absorbed too much of the spices and salt.  We did not have potatoes, so did not make gravy.  Gravy may have enhanced the dish.  The chicken itself had a pretty pleasant taste and I used the leftover chicken the next day for a sandwich, but couldn't face the \"mooshy\" veggies again.",
