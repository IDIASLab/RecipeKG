I will say that it is a very healthy meal. You can't do any better than fresh vegetables and garlic. There needs to be more spices in this recipe. We both found it very bland and adding more soy just made it taste cheap. Nothing against any vegetarians here but some chicken stock would have worked wonders. Just my 2 cents. One more thing - I hope you have either a food processor or a Japanese chef because chopping all those veggies takes time.",
