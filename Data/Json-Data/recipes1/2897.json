I was looking for a quick-bread that would be a little different than the run of the mill zucchini or pumpkin or banana - and this got rave reviews from everyone! (I did omit the walnuts because I wasn't sure about the tots being able to chew them well and because of allergy concerns). I just used a standard loaf pan but have kept an eye out for the longer-style pan in second hand shops that Joan wrote about in the recipe's intro. I'm so glad to have a new way of including dates in our snack-times. Thanks very much!",
