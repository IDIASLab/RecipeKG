Made carrots baked in the oven with a bit of butter and cinnamon and a cranberry wild/brown rice pilaf. :)  i'd say this is one my fav meals in a long time.. thank you soooo much.  i didnt use garlic salt.. i used 2 cloves of garlic and added a bit of ground sea salt... and freshly ground pepper. :):) sooo good.. will make for company for sure! :)",

You should cook salmon based on thickness.\nBake uncovered in a preheated 450\u00b0F oven for 4-6 minutes for each .5 inch of thickness. As others have stated, you shouldn't marinade fish for any longer than 30 minutes. If you want the flavor to really soak in, marinade in tin foil to keep the marinade on the filet.\nGreat recipe idea and some great alternative ideas!!",

I followed the recipe exactly- and added a tablespoon of horseradish.  (I knew it would be too sweet for us- we're spicy people here!)  This recipe is awesome and delish!  I cooked my salmon for 20 minutes and took the foil off for the last 5, spooned some of the sauce over the top after it came out and it was PHENOMENAL!!!!!!!  Rock my socks good!  Thanks so much for this recipe!  It is great!  UPDATE- made this again with thicker cuts of salmon and had to cook longer - maybe 40 mins.  The cooking time really seems to vary depending on the thickness of the fish.",

The changes I made: I don't like to use garlic salt so I decided to omit it. I used light maple syrup so I added a tablespoon of dark brown sugar (which oddly added a nice sweet hint of molasses). I minced up a two small cloves of garlic and added some extra garlic powder on top. I double layered a sheet of aluminum foil and set the mostly thawed pieces of salmon in with the mixture. I folded up the foil into a bag and set everything into a baking dish and turned the bag occationally while the salmon finished defrosting. While in the oven I flipped the bag over twice more and then at the end I opened the bag and broiled the top of the salmon for just about 3 minutes so the sugars could carmelize a little. *My filets were about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 inches thick so I could beef up the flavor... maybe if yours are thinner you might add a little less, use your judgement.",

                "reviewBody": "This was an interesting salmon recipe.  The maple syrup is very nice for the taste buds, though personally, I'd use a little less syrup.  (I used the real deal organic maple syrup, though, so perhaps the taste was a little stronger?)  Anyway, the problem I have with this recipe is the contrasting tastes.  Although syrup sounds fascinating when pairied with garlic and pepper and soy, the flavors seem at odds and even compete with each other. Especially the garlic.  It's just not a pleasant complement, aaccording to my family's preferences.  In fact, I'd say the whole recipe competes too much with the natural taste of salmon.  So, if you're a traditional fan, and love salmon + lemon/lime/etc, you might want to stick to that.  However, if you love sweets and don't mind heavy unusual- tasting dishes, this might be the recipe for you.",
