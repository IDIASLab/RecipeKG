A few hints, though: (1) If this is your first time making merengue, you might want to be prepared to do it over. It's not hard, but precise: absolutely no yolk, and beat on high until glossy. (2) the easiest way to dust the pan with cornstarch is to place pan in a bag, add a couple of tablespoons of corn starch and shake - you'll have to wipe off the outside of the pan, though. (3) I've started adding a few new toppings every time I make pavlova and the biggest hit has been kiwi, strawberries, and blueberries, with a little chocolate drizzle (equal parts butter and chocolate chips, melted).  So good!",

Since I didn't have cream of tartar I subbed extra vinegar (3/8 teaspoon instead of 1/8 teaspoon of cream of tartar... the substituation is always replace cream of tartar with 3 times the measurement of vinegar or lemon juice). Everything turned out wonderfully. I used Mango, kiwi, and canned pears. Great recipe!!!",

I wasn't sure how long to cook it and probably kept it in longer than necessary but it didn't seem to make a difference in the taste/texture. I topped it with whipped cream fresh raspberries and a homemade raspberry sauce (frozen berries & sugar heated on stove then pushed through strainer to remove seeds). I can't wait to make it again.

I'm giving it a go although there is something lovely about a free form pavlova. This desert is claimed by both Australia and New Zealand but it was invented by a chef in Sydney Australia in honor of Anna Pavlova the ballerina. So there Kiwi's - the desert is decidely Australian.
