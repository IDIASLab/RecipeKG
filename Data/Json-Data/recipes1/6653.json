For those of you who weren't that impressed, use teriyaki baste & glaze (not just a sauce or marinade) -- it's thicker and adds much more flavor than a marinade.  No need to marinade over night or hours before if you use this.  I used Kikoman baste & glaze and Hidden Valley ranch lite, with real bacon(low salt) crumbled.  I didn't fry the chicken - I just spooned on the baste & glaze to both sides of the chicken & then spooned on the ranch, with everything else following.  Great with an angel hair pasta with sauteed garlic, tomatoes, onions, and spices.",

Then after browning the chicken I mixed the remaining teriyaki sauce with the ranch and spooned the mixture over the chicken. That eliminated the \"gross\" color I've read others complain about. I think next time I will cover the dish with foil before baking to keep the cheese from drying out so much. We eat baked chicken in more than 50% of our meals and this was a really nice change from the ordinary.",

This is what I did: I used real bacon and cooked it saved the drippings and sauted the chicken in them. I didn't have any ranch dressing but I had ranch seasoning packet so I combined whatever left I had of sour cream and plain yogurt with the ranch to make the dressing. I also didn't have teriyaki sauce but instead a marinating sauce which isn't really \"sauce\" so I thickened the marinating sauce with corn starch and it was fine. Other than that I followed the recipe to the T and it came out perfect! I only made two chicken breast and my sister who doesn't like cheese loved it. Too bad I didn't make her any =/. Oh and I do agree that it is a bit salty (wasn't too bad for us) so you might want to use low sodium ingredients.",
