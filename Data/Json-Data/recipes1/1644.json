I used whole wheat white flour and because I'm low on vegetable oil I cut the vegetable oil by half and substituted the rest with my homemade organic applesauce. I did warm the orange juice and I soaked the raisins in the warm orange juice for about twenty minutes before I added the rest of the wet ingredients. I did not make this for my family so I cut the raisins by half and I did not add the nuts (you never know if other people love raisins as much as you do OR are allergic to nuts). This turned out fabulous. Very moist and the combination of the tomato sauce (you can't tell what it is in the cake but you like it--it's really good!) and spices was just wonderful. I would up the spices next time just a touch and add a little vanilla extract. For my family I think it needs the nuts (I would use pecans--we're not a walnut family) and keep the raisins halved. I think that using a cup and a half would have been overkill. I was able to get 12 largish regular muffins and 24 largeish mini-muffins out of this recipe. It makes a lot so if you don't have a big family make sure you have room in your freezer OR you've got friends who like muffins!",

Now Following this to a T I didn't think anything was wrong with the cake until it was finished and went to slicing portions. It was falling apart. It really had a hard time getting one good portion with out making a mess of the cake everywhere. It was moist not dry but fell apart. I feel the excessive raisins keeps the cake from binding together. I will make this again TOTALLY!! But with the reduction of raisins. Because it's the only thing really and truely in the recipe that was excessive. This also would make a better bar style treat verses an actual cake. Possibly using a jelly roll pan and make bar treats. But above all great spice flavor and the spice lingers a bit in the mouth as well. No traces of any tomato flavor at all. My husband was totally shocked and my kids thought it was a pumpkin spiced fruit cake....boy were they wrong about the pumpkin. But was totally worth making.",

I don't recommend eating it the first day as it is very dry. It needs to sit a day to become a nice moist loaf. It's not my idea of a 'cake' anymore than a banana loaf is a cake and this is a bit firmer than a banana loaf. Goes great with a cup of tea or coffee though. Nice flavour nice rich color. Took 10 minutes longer to cook than suggested by the recipe. I might make it again but will add some orange zest to compliment the orange juice in the recipe or maybe even use some frozen juice concentrate. Or both.",
