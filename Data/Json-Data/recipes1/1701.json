I altered the recipe slightly by adding fresh lemon zest and finely chopped mixed nuts to the batter. I baked the cake in a decorative \"snowflake\" pan. Making the glaze I put the juice of a whole lemon (instead of 2 Tbs) and mixed in the powdered sugar until I had the consistency I wanted -- on the thinner side. I brushed the top and sides of the cake with this mixture. When the cake cooled I dusted the top with \"snow\" (powdered sugar). It was VERY EASY and a refreshing change from the spice and chocolate recipes we all love at this time of the year! Happy Holidays!",

I did one in a bundt pan (baking time was right on) with diced dried apricot bits (rehydrated: poured very hot water over them let them sit for 5 minutes drained) folded into the batter. The other was following the recipe but in a 9x13\" (baking time 40 minutes). Both were great but the general consensus was the cake with apricot bits was better... Oh and they were plenty sweet and moist without the glaze so I just sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar over top.",

My wife is the cake fan in the family and she loved it but I also enjoyed it too. The glaze is exceptional and really makes this cake. As one other reviewer suggested I made extra glaze in total 1/2 more than the recipe calls for and I'm glad I did. The cake was moist and delicious though it was a little too dark brown on the top. It was actually done in 45 minutes which may relate to the kind of pan I used. Cooking it this way or maybe because of my oven efficiency the bake time minimum of 50 minutes was a little too long. This recipe takes the cake!",

A good tip for the pan is to use granulated sugar instead of flour after greasing. Then you don't have the ugly flour residue on the finished cake. I use the juice of one whole lemon for the glaze. Delicious. When I have weekend visitors I make this and it just disappears!",
