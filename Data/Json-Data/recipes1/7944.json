I also used salsa instead of tomatoes and I added black olives and jalapenos on top. I heated the layers up to the cheese and toppings except for the sour cream. After the cheese was melted I removed the dip from the oven let it cool for a minute or two and then I added the sour cream on top.

By this time it was too watery because I had used a can of diced tomatoes w/green chiles (change #2) that I thought I had thoroughly drained but it was a soupy mess! May try again after chilling the 2 hours as stated in the recipe. Thanks Rusty.",
