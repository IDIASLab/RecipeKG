This is very easy to make but I spruced it up with a little garlic salt and parmesan cheese. I bet this would go great with an italian type main dish such as chicken milano or something like that. I enjoyed it and the leftovers heated up well.... but again if you plan to make this a maindish be sure to spruce it up with some other spices....otherwise you might think it's too bland.
