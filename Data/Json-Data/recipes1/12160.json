When I was ready to put it in the oven I rubbed a bit of water over the top and sprinkled sugar on it and wrapped the edges in aluminum foil.

Perhaps the recipe should make a note to add flour or water by teaspoon until the dough sticks together in a ball. I used a pastry blender wrapped it in a pastry cloth in the refrigerator. I always used to have a difficult time rolling out doughs until I invested in a heavy marble roller and tile. These are put in the refrigerator or freezer to make them cold to reduce the stickiness that occurs when the butter/shortening gets too warm when working. All in all a great and easy crust. 4 stars because of lack of dough consistency hints.",
