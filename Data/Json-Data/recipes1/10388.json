I live in an area where pacific salmon is very prevelant and I needed a recipe that would use up the leftovers from my catch of salmon. This was great. My family and I are not the greatest salmon fanciers and enjoyed how this recipe did not have an overpowering taste of salmon. If you like but dont love salmon this is a good recipe mind you when frying the patties they absorb a tremedous amount of oil. Make sure you pan is hot.",

I added parsley, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne. I also added about 1 T milk to help the potatoes stick together, and I used crushed gold fish crackers on the outside instead of flour. I only used 3-4 T oil to fry them. Perfection.",
