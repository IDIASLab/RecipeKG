I left out the sour cream, hot sauce & peppers for his sake, but it was still good.  Sometimes when I don't have shredded cheddar, I just use a slice of Kraft singles and it works out just fine.  Usually he can't tell the difference.  Thanks for a simple but kid friendly recipe Brooke.",

First I warmed up the refried beans and added a tbs of salsa garlic powder and 1/4 of pinto beans. I also sauteed onions and green peppers and cut up tomatoes. Then I piled up the burritos as follow... beans sauteed onions and green peppers tomatoes shredded cheddar cheese sour cream and salsa. Wrap up the burrito and placed them on a greased pan for about 12minutes. My family loved these burritos. I served them with spanish rice. This was so good my family requested it again the next night.",

I slopped some extra sour cream and taco sauce on top. My one big complaint that no one has mentioned: I doubled the filling because I wanted to make two. And that was just barely enough to fill a 10\" tortilla. I even double-checked the recipe that it hadn't been meant for a smaller one. I cannot imagine 1/4 cup beans and slice of cheese even remotely matching a 10\" tortilla unless you just enjoy eating tortillas.",
