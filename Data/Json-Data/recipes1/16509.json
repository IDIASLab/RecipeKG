I have given this recipe one of my coveted 5-star ratings, as I truly don't see any way to make it better.\n\nStarting with the frozen Brussels sprouts.  I urge you not to think you will improve this recipe by using fresh.  Unless you are pulling them from your own garden, Brussels sprouts are never truly fresh, and they rapidly deteriorate once harvested.  If you MUST use fresh, be sure to at least use the ones that come still attached to the stalk.  The reason they sell them that way is because of the rapid deterioration these vegetable experience once harvested.  This is also why so many people think they don't like Brussels sprouts!  \n\nThe mixture of apples and onions into this recipe is perfect, and the lemon adds a nice tang.\n\nAs the original recipe notes in the footnotes, you can adjust roasting time for desired doneness.  I find that 40 minutes produces a better result, turning the vegetables every 10-15 minutes for even browning.  You want them slightly darkened and caramelized.  I am experimenting with using the convection feature of our oven to see if I can achieve this effect quicker.   Best to use non-stick foil to line your roasting pan to prevent sticking.",

Absolutely delicious, no bitter taste either and the apples added a wonderful flavor.",

The apples and the onions play off of each other well, and the brussels sprouts come out nicely seared, giving them the best possible flavor.  I do have a few notes to take this from a 4 to a 5, though:\n\nFirst, tossing the sprouts, apples, and onions in the oil instead of drizzling will help coat them completely and get a better bake on them.  \n\nSecond, pecans.  a cup of untoasted pecans added before baking will make this dish really pop.  I added mine after trying the dish, and it definitely enhanced the flavor.",
