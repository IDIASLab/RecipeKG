Mix with a couple of tab of lemon juice, olive oil and a little bit of dill pickle juice. Add salt and pepper and cover and chill for a couple of hours and make sure to chill your macaroni as well. Later mix enough mayo to coat your macaroni and drain a bit of the juices from your mix and add to the macaroni and mix well. Add about 5 chopped boiled eggs and mix well and sprinkle some paprika on top and wala! You have a great macaroni salad!",

I also put fresh garlic into my salad - toss it in with the dressing to marinate the pasta. I also add to mine olives sweet gherkins. Red or yellow bell peppers sounds great and I don't care much for celery so I would substitute them with cucumbers chopped fine and blotted to get out the moisture. Also I would season with some extra granulated garlic - can you guess I like garlic:)",
