Well now that I've checked the large box at the store it calls for a LARGE BOX OF PUDDING! It actually tastes great with the smaller box too. It comes out a with at cake-like texture instead of a brownie-like texture and the chips and nuts sit on top instead of sinking in. Next time I try it I'll use the right size box of pudding.",

Cake was so thick and sweet but you really need to add in the pudding to make it thick enough to keep the chips and nuts from sinking. If I were to make this again I would probably use instant sugar-free pudding (that was let to sit for a couple minutes after beating to thicken) and I would try to get away with adding 3/4 of it to the cake mix. I would definitely only use 1 cup butterscotch chips since this was the most sugary part. Walnuts were great! Probably won't make this one again though. Sorry!",
