I put it over a chocolate cake recipe I get from the Hershey's cocoa container. For the cake recipe itself I substitute half the sugar as packed light brown & sometimes use heavy cream in place of the milk. I also like to use some Rodelle cocoa powder whenever possible. This frosting perfected the super moist chocolate cake for a decadent treat. My husband couldn't resist it. I can see this very simple recipe being easily modified with other flavors like cherry with almond extract. Hmmm... I think I'm going to try peach over a yellow cake next. I like the pumpkin idea too. Definitely saving this recipe.",

I am pairing it with a basic white cake recipe  I found on here as well for my daughter's 3rd b-day tomorrow. I added more strawberry jam for more flavor and red food coloring for a bold color.  Funny thing is, I had to make 4x the recipe for the cake, but I actually ran out of about 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar but it still tastes great! I think if I added the rest of it, that it may have been too sweet. Well done, and I will recommend to everyone!",
