The flavor was great, so the next time I make this I'll use the dressing again. To help keep the coating on the chicken, you need to let it set. After breading, place the chicken in the fridge for about 30 minutes. I took the advice of another reviewer and placed the chicken on racks to help keep the bottom crispy. We really loved this!

I dip the chicken in egg before dredging in dry mixture, coating sticks to chicken better also makes thicker and crisper crust. Also tried bone in cut up chicken  pieces done the same way just bake longer until juices run clear. Thank you Anna",

(I didn't have time) So I just put some of the hot sauce (Chicken wing hot sauce is what I used) in a little bowl and rolled the chciken in it till it was coated in the sauce before I coated it with the flour/bread crumb mixture. Also I used vegetable oil instead of Olive Oil to pan fry it because Olive Oil has that strong flavour and I didn't want the chicken to tast like that. Anyway SOOO yummy and crispy! Not at all greasy either. Deffinetly will be making this again!",
