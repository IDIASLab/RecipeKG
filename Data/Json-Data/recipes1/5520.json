Even though I cut back on the butter, I still had some left, that I didn't need. This would probably coat  at least two servings of pasta unless you like it swimming in butter.

After it sauteed for a few minutes to get the flavor into the butter I added about a Tbsp of flour to thicken things up. Once it was thickened I added milk a Tbsp at a time until the sauce smoothed out a bit and because the consistency I wanted...something that would be a little thinner but still all hold onto my gnocchi's without puddling at the bottom of the bowl. As soon as I got the right consistency I added a pinch of sea salt for flavor and a shake or two of italian seasoning which really made the sauce. It was AMAZING!!
