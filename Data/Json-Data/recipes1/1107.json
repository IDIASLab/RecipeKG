However I just want to point out that the directions for the glaze are somewhat misleading. I would suggest NOT boiling the glaze for 5 minutes. I did mine on moderately high heat for 5 minutes and it got very dark brown and I think burned. I would suggest on low heat for only a couple of minutes. That should really be noted in the recipe. If anyone else can suggest how they really make the glaze for this one it would be most appreciated.",
