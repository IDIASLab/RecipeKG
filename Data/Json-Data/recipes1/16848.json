As instructed, I refrigerated the cookie dough for 2 hours,  It was so darn hard when it came out of the fridge that it was difficult to get a cookie scoop filled and pulled out.  The cookies were tender and tasty, but if I make again, I\u2019ll go for less time in the fridge.  I\u2019ll probably try a batch after a 30-minute refrigeration, and then if I find it needs more time, will put the dough back in the refrigerator before the next batch, but it won\u2019t be for 2 hours.",
