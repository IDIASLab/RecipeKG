I have looked for this recipe since forever and am so glad I found it. For the one lady in England that does not have a tube pan if you need one take a large pan place a heat proof glass in the center and viola a tube pan. For those who do not like the texture of the cake remember it is called a \"sponge\" cake. I am making one today using only lemon juice and rind. Yum! Thanks so much for this recipe. From the other reviews I am sure I will give this recipe a five star rating. To avoid having problems getting the cake out of the pan line the bottom of pan with ungreased parchment paper. The paper will slide out with the cake and can then be peeled off easily. Just tear off a piece of parchment paper the width of the bottom of the pan take a pencil or pen and draw around the bottom of the pan onto the paper then cut the paper a little smaller than you have drawn and it should fit nicely into the tube pan.",

                "reviewBody": "I made quite a few changes to this recipe based on the reviews here a sponge cake recipe in a baking book (that explains their rigorous testing methods) my own tastes - but I kept the egg ingredients the same since I wanted to use up a whole lot of yolks! Sorry I'm not posting it as a custom version but I don't want to buy that membership! My cake turned out very well (I'd rate 5 ) & got many positive comments from the eaters. Texture was just right - a bit spongy yet light enough - not too dense. Flavor nice. I think the egg whipping is important see below. Here goes: Total of 1 2/3 c flour but make it up of about 2 parts cake flour and one part all-purpose flour. Same baking powder and salt as recipe same sifting together instructions. Same quantity of eggs but: Separate the whole egg add its yolk to the others. Whip up the egg white to soft peaks set aside. Now spend a LOT of time whipping the yolks like 10 minutes til they're REALLY lovely light and pale colored. Fold in the whipped egg white. Same amount of sugar. Recipe makes it sound like you have to beat yolks and sugar together for 10 minutes - not sure about that need! Same amount of zest orange juice. Gentle but thorough folding is probably important. I substituted orange extract for the lemon extract. I added 2 T Grand Marnier (orange liqueur) and removed 2T from the water quantity. I used room temperature water not boiling water. Tube pan. Check for done-ness at 45 mins. Good luck - Enjoy!",

I went against my better judgement in following a recipe that calls for adding boiling water to beaten egg yolks which \"cooked\" them and killed the leavening agent before it even went into the oven. I followed the recipe exactly (I understand the importance of careful beating and folding.) However the cake didn't rise was beyond spongy (rubbery) had so-so flavor (could have benefited from vanilla or almond in addition to the orange zest and lemon extract.) and was over baked at 60 minutes. I come from a long line of bakers and will stick with the trusted sponge cake recipes handed down from my grandmothers in the future none of which is any more difficult than this. I'm annoyed with myself for wasting all the ingredients on this one. My husband took one bite and said it wasn't worth eating. I ate a small piece and saved a slice for my mom (a professional baker) who guessed just what was wrong without my telling her about the recipe instructions. We both agree this is an inferior sponge cake. The biggest problem is the boiling water dumped into the egg yolks and leavening.",
