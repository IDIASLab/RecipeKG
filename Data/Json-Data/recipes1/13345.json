                "reviewBody": "Easiest recipe out there. Great for the holidays. I reviewed this in 06 but am making some updates as of 12/09. There is another cornbread casserole recipe (by Sarah Piepert) which is great if you want a more tradiitonal cornbread.....almost identical but has butter, no cheese, less sour cream, and a better estimated cooking time. As a rule of thumb for both recipes I always omit the eggs (I like my cornbread more bread-y and less like a souffle) and then cook for up to an hour or hour and 15 minutes.   A 30 minute cooking time is not enough. Regarding the cheese, if you're going for a Mexican inspired meal add it in. I usually use 1/2 the suggested (4 oz) shredded mild cheddar.\n\nPlan to serve Cornbread Casseroles using a spoon. It really wasn't meant to be cut into pieces like the picture.\n\nI love bringing this meals to holiday gatherings because it's so easy and always a hit.  With preschool kids to dress and get ready, the last thing I need on a busy holiday is to prepare a complicated dish.  Enjoy.",

I made the recipe exactly as listed, except I added only 4 oz. of shredded cheddar cheese to the top instead of 8 oz.-- and I used reduced fat cheese.  YUM!  The texture is perfect, not mushy at all.  The flavor is just right and the aroma while baking is incredible.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it and I'm sure I'll be making it again.",

Only thing I do different is I do NOT save the liquid from the corn and I add one 4 ounce can of mild green chilies. Very moist, very VERY good. I have a hard time keeping this one around, it always disappears. NOTE: To make this even better, heat some butter in a cast iron skillet while you preheat your oven, then pour the batter into the skillet and cook that way. Omnom.",
