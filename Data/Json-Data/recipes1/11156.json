For ease in preparation I used a bag of pre-made salad which had carrots and red cabbage and left-over rotisserie chicken. Also as suggested by another reviewer I added mandarin oranges. With these changes this salad was easily made within 8 minutes - great for busy weeknights. However the dressing was a bit bland. The recipe doesn't state which vinegar to use so I would conclude she meant white vinegar. I suggest you use cider vinegar to give it some zing. Also you may want to add a couple of teaspoons of Teriyaki sauce. I think that really helped it a lot. Although the dressing needs to be tweeted a bit for personal taste it is a recipe worth trying and keeping. We really enjoyed it.",
