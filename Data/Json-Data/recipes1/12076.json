The problem for me (and apparently for the previous reviewer)is the amount of liquid--I cut it down by about 3 tablespoons or so. I would recommend letting the mixture rest for about 1 minute after the second zap in the microwave. Then you have to beat it like crazy until it starts to go opaque--spoon out some and see if it looks like the pecans are starting to stick together. THEN you are ready to drop them--work fast because once it starts to set up your time is running out. This recipe is certainly worth a try--the texture is heavenly. If the pralines don't come out you have some lovely ice cream topping.",
