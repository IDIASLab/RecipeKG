Cooking the rice ahead of time and refrigerating it makes a big difference.  I didnt have the time the first time to do this.  also, i used regular oil and sesame oil to fry the rice in and the sesame oil added a much needed flavor.  i used frozen peas and carrots and chopped onion and added the beaten egg over the mixture and cooked until the rice was no longer shiny.  Cooking the egg this way worked better for me than frying it in advance.  I cooked the bean sprouts seperately in sesame oil and soy sauce and added it to the rice in the end.  YUMMY.  Thank you so much for the recipe!",

This is a very easy, low mess way of doing it. I added my egg to the boiling water/soy mixture and beat it like I would egg drop soup. Added the rice, some green onion tops, black pepper to taste. I used chicken broth instead of water or boullion as well. Doing it that way I didnt' need any salt either, it was perfect (I'm a saltaholic and it was still fine). Very nice, thanks.",

So i searched through my cabinets and realized that i hadn't been to the store lately but i did have a TON of rice. I searched for rice and found this. I did not make this expecting it to taste like my usual Chinese bistro's rice i made it because i had all the ingredients it was cheap and it could feed a lot of people. I cooked the rice the night before and refrigerated it. In the morning i did the rest. I doubled the recipe. The only soy sauce i had was a handful of the little packets and it was enough...more than enough. I couldn't have made this had the rice not been refrigerated over night. I added Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce the red Chinese sauce with the rooster on the bottle about a teaspoon. It really spiced it up. Gave it a great taste just a little kick. It was a hit at the cook out. Cheap quick and tasty... what more could you ask for?",
