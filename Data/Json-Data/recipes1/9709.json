I made this for a romantic meal for my husband and myself with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  He (ever the meat-and-potatoes man) was in heaven.\n\nBabs--oyster sauce is a thick, brown sauce that would either be in the condiment or Asian food section of your grocery (I had to ask for help finding it in my mid-sized grocery, but they had it.)  'Dynasty' was the name of the brand I found.  You can also get it online.\n\n(3/3/2006) I'm still making, and LOVING, this recipe, and I just wanted to add--the marinade freezes beautifully, so I make the full batch of marinade and freeze half of it (as I've never made it for 8 people).  Also, my latest addition to the meal is putting sliced baby Portobellos in the marinade (just dip them and then take them out, the marinade soaks in QUICKLY) after I remove the steaks.  Saute them with a little marinade until tender and serve on top or on the side of the filets.  Heavenly!",

The ONLY thing I changed was that I didn't want to purchase a shallot for the final butter mixture so I just used all green onion. I will also add that I made extra on the butter/wine/green onion and served it to be spread on French bread. This was positively sensational and I disagree with it being a lot of extra work. It was a snap to prepare. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes a green salad the French bread and of course... the left over Burgundy wine! Everyone raved and I was pleased beyond words! It did make quite a bit of marinade sauce but that will be fun trying it out on different cuts of meat and the George Foreman grill. Yummmmmmmmmmmmm!",

Also in the supermarket I could only find oyster \"flavored\" sauce which was in the oriental aisle. I'm not sure whether this was the correct product it was very thick. I used the red burgundy and this oyster \"flavored\" sauce and it turned out fabulous. So I assume that I guessed right with the wine and sauce. I would recommend using a little less canola oil for the sauce because it really doesn't seem that necessary. And I didn't use the grill but rather broiled the fillets. I highly recommend everyone try this recipe the flavors are incredible. We had the fillets with frozen shoestring fries. The sauce over the fries was excellent!",

I followed the recipe almost exactly except we didn't have any charcoal so we put the tenderloins in the oven on broil (approx 500 degrees) for about 7 minutes on each side. I let them rest for another 10 minutes before dolloping the butter on and placing them in the 200 degree oven. They came out perfect -pink inside but not too pink. (The tenderloins I used were approximately an inch thick) My husband and daughter both loved this recipe. I served the steak with garlic mashed potatos and steamed asparagus. I will make this recipe again but next time I promise to take a picture. Thanks Penelope Holmes for a fabulous recipe!",

I like oyster sauce very much (used extensively in Chinese cooking) however it does contain MSG so be forewarned as many people must avoid MSG added to food.  My husband really enjoys this.  I would recommend scaling the recipe way down if only making 2 or 4 steaks as it yields a whole lot of liquid.  I also think the added butter/wine topping for serving, while adding a very rich buttery sauce, can be easily ommitted.  To cool the liquid down faster, I put it in the freezer for a short time, and I also don't marinade longer than an hour or two max as I find the flavor becomes too strong.",

I marinated the beef for the five hours the recipe called for, and the taste was entirely too strong for me -- it masked the beef taste entirely.  My husband, who likes steak sauce, likened it to beef with the steak sauce built in.  If I ever decided to make this again, I'd marinate it for only an hour or two.",
