I had too much chicken to put in one pan so I decided to do a little test and pan fry the rest of it the traditional way.  The oven fried was better overall; it required less \"work\" because you only had to flip it once and didn't have to \"watch\" it and oil didn't pop out and burn me (as usual).  I think the key to keeping the coating on is making sure you pat dry the chicken first, coat well with the flour, shaking off the excess, quickly drudging it though the egg, which I added about 4 tablespoons of standard hot sauce to my egg mixture just to give it a little kick, and then really roll it around in the bread crumbs to get a nice even coat.  I added lemmon pepper seasoning after the chicken was in the pan right before it went into the oven and it really was delish.  Will do this again for sure!!",

It would take her all day to pound, bread and fry this juicy familiar family favorite. I have not had chicken like that since she passed away... that is, until now! This chicken tasted very very similar to hers, with half the work. I used boneless, skinnless chicken thighs (b/c that is what I had), and only about 1/2 cup oil. My only advice is that you don't overcrowd the pan- maybe that is why some people's took forever. The chicken has to have space between the pieces for oil and air to move or they will turn soggy. I had my pan too full and realized it in time to separate into two before any problems arose. Overall, great, easy, tasty and not greasy, if you go easy on the oil and blot on towels afterward. Loved it!!! Thanks. Grandma lives on!",
