Then I cut the chicken breasts into bite size pieces and sprinkled some hot chili powder on the chicken pieces prior to browning.  I then added the tomatoes with green chili peppers, beans and I used frozen corn and it turned out fantastic.  I did try to freeze it and it freezes really good.  However, I would suggest if you do freeze it you may want to add the beans in closer to the end of the cooking time because mine were a little soft after reheating.  GREAT DISH!!!",

One morning I threw frozen chicken breasts into my slow cooker along with most of the other ingredients listed in this recipe, and ended up with a most delicious soup. I did make my own black beans, adding them to the slow cooker a couple of hours later; I also added 1/2 cup of uncooked white rice and some smoked sausage...turned out great. If the chicken hadn't been frozen, I would have tried the recipe as written; I will do that next time because it sounds wonderful. Thank you for this delicious, versatile recipe!",

I shreaded the chicken and served in on tortillas with cheese. All of my roommates thought it was awesome!!",
