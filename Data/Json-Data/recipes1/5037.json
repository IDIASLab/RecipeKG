And following the steps to brown the chicken etc I did just that. Later scoop the chicken up and do the sauce. I added the orange juice 3/4 cups only instead of 3 cups. Then added the spicy mango sauce. Add more salt to it so that the OJ won't be too overpowering or too sour/sweet. Next put the chicken back in and stir in sliced carrots and red capsicum. It looks good and enhances the taste. Oh and before that make sure the chicken is marinated with Worchestershire sauce salt pepper and dark soy sauce. Try again!:)",

I found it delightfully fruity and light-tasting. No rice needed - just added some steamed veggies for an excellent summer meal!",
