I would marinate the meat longer than the 15 minutes called for and as for cooking to 140 - I don't agree - this meat should be pink in the center and only takes a couple of minutes per side on a hot grill.  Slice against the grain into thin strips and you can't go wrong.  Delicious!  Enjoy!",

Not sure marinated it for 15 minutes would actually do the trick.  Maybe it's true, but I didn't want tough meat. So to be sure, I marinated for about a day and a half, turning it over and over in the fridge to make sure all sides were nice and juicy!  I can't wait to get more skirt steak to do it again!
