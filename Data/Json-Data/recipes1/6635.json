I also thought there wouldn't be enough dressing for the amount of chicken, but I was very wrong on both counts. I boiled the breasts for about 20 minutes to cook, and combined Miracle Whip with T. Marzetti's original slaw dressing. I added the onions and celery, then shredded the cooked breasts and added those. I didn't feel like it needed salt or pepper, so I threw everything into the food processor, chopped it up, and ended up with a baby food-type mush with a slight crunch. I put together 5 sandwiches, threw them in a cooler for a road-trip my boyfriend and I were taking, and all five were gone within an hour. They were so easy and so delicious, and I will never buy chicken salad again. I didn't even need to tweak anything! Throw away your skepticisms and try this recipe-- it's perfect as is.",

I have never tried cole slaw dressing and didn't even know they made such an item but I found it in my local shoprite.  It added a wonderful flavor!!  As another reviewer, I did not \"puree\" this in a food processor but left it chunky.  Yummy recipe!  Thanks!",

Do yourself a favor and make the coleslaw dressing...http://salad.allrecipes.com/AZ/ClSlwDrssing.asp, I used Vegenaise (just like mayonnaise) in place of the creamy dressing, added a 1/2 cup of cashews. I fifn't use a food processor because I think it breaks it down too much, just diced into small pieces. This can also be made into a delicious sandwich by adding bacon strips, sliced avocado and provolone or swiss cheese. We couldn't stop eating it!",

No changes made at all, but I think I agree with the person who said the onion was just a tad much.  I think next time I make it (and there will be a next time), I'll decrease the onion a little.  Superb!\n\nUpdate:  I made this recipe again, and used 1/2 tsp onion powder as opposed to the 1/4 onion.  The overpowering onion taste was gone, and the powder added just enough flavor.
