We thought this was good for something different and the color of it was really beautiful but I just thought it was lacking something which is odd because of all the flavors that were going on. I made this just as written except for adding some salt which I felt it needed. I think next time I would add some chopped hard boiled eggs for something extra too. This will not replace my usual potato salad recipe but it was nice to try and I may make it on occasion! Thanks for sharing.:)",
