Juice will happen with perfectly tree ripened, melt in your mouth sweet peaches.  Those kind of peaches are best eaten fresh, sliced, with a splash of cream, or vanilla ice cream, drizzled with Frangelico.  \nFor a cobbler, use those rock hard peaches from the grocery store.  They won't be too juicy, once baked.  Use a potato peeler to remove the skins.  It is harder to remove the pit from the rock hard peaches.  Slice the peeled peach, then break slices away from the pit.  Keep slices fairly large.\nPeaches vary in size.  Use enough peach slices to fill your dish about one and a quarter inches deep.  I've made this in a 9\" x 9\" glass casserole and in a 9\" x 13\" glass baking dish.  For the 9\" x 13\", increase the biscuit topping quantities by 50%.  I like adding a teaspoon of vanilla, and some nutmeg to the peach mixture.  Cinnamon, ginger, or cardamom would also work well.",

I did add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the peaches, but only a little: 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp nutmeg, cuz it's such a potent spice... oh, and I sprinkled in a pinch of ground cloves and added about half a tsp of this special Tahitian vanilla and scraped 1/2 of a vanilla bean into it... but as manu others have mentioned, you MUST drain some of the juice after baking the peaches, but before baking the dough... otherwise you'll get a soup consistancy...

My husband had a craving for this and so I thought I'd give it a try and boy am I glad I did. My peaches took a little bit longer to boil because they were a bit hard. I added 1 tsp. of vanilla 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg to the peaches along with the sugar. People commented on how the peaches made too much juice so I also tossed them with 2 Tbsp. of flour as well. For the biscuits I used 1/4 c. of sugar and added 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg. I sprinkled the tops with sugar in the raw for some extra added crunch and sweetness. When these finally came out of the oven the peaches were surrounded in a nice thick syrup that wasn't overly sweet and the biscuits were perfect. You couldn't ask for a better homemade dessert and these went great with vanilla ice cream. I can now say I'm a fan of \"Peach Cobbler\"!",
