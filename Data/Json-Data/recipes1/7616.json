I did take another's advice who stated that they added 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter. Also, after I reduced the heat to 350 degrees, I only had to bake for 10 min (thus, total baking time was 30 min).  Had I baked any longer, these goodies would have been burnt. Although they taste just as good as \"Cold Oven Popoevrs\" (also found on this site), I like that recipe a little better b/c you aren't messing with the oven temp. Still, excellent recipe with excellent results!! One last thing, I made \"Cinnamon Honey Butter\" (again, from this site) and spread it inside the warm popovers...yup! I'm in heaven!! Thanks Christy!",

When they popped they did not taste very good and when they did not pop so much, the flavor was good.  This recipe is my very first success. I used popover pans that are non-stick and I never thought to butter the outside top of the pans but next time I will because that is how huge they ended up being.  I cannot thank you enough.  I also reduced the cooking time and put a dot of butter in the bottom of each tin.  Wonderful",

For those that had problems - a few tips:  milk and eggs must be at room temperature - leave out for 30+ minutes at least.  Batter will be thin and its okay to have small lumps.  Do not open oven door while baking - use oven light if you want to look at them baking.",

I've made them with great care and on the fly and just can't seem to mess them up.  I do have a tip however: when right out of the oven poke the tops with a fork to let extra steam escape. If you don't they will deflate.  By doing this you can throw any extra in the freezer for a later a quick zap in the microwave and perfect accompaniment to a cup of soup.",
