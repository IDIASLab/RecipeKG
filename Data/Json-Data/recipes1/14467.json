I cut down the oil and use just enough to coat. I use brown sugar too, but either way it's delicious and healthy! I bake beets alone 20m, add yams and seasoning and red onion, then bake add'l 40m.

My aunt quickly called dibs on the small amount of leftovers we had. I ended up eating only a small portion because I was feeding our 18-month-old twins from my plate and they couldn't get enough! One of DH's cousins even called the next day to get the recipe. Two changes I made: (1) 1/2 the pepper -- the pepper completely overpowered the dish otherwise, and (2) I used canned beets cause that's all I had on hand. One can = 3 beets called for in recipe. I didn't cook them ahead; just threw them into pan with the rest and cooked for 45 minutes. Everything came out tender and delicious! My grandmom, the sweet-potato-hater, asked me to bring the same dish to Christmas!!",

However,  I hate the mess & aggravation of peeling raw beets, so I roasted them first (with a little olive oil); when they were almost done, I let them cool & they were much easier to peel.  I don't think they bleed quite as much either.  By roasting them before combining,  you can reduce the overall cooking time & you're guaranteed tender beets.  Thanks for a delicious dish!",

Onions carmelize into pieces of 'candy', and don't resemble taste or texture of a raw onion.  As for the garlic, I add the whole cloves, and let them roast whole, as well.  Sometimes I smash a couple cloves slightly with the flat of the knife to release garlic oil, then toss with veggies, olive oil, and salt.  I roast most my veggies now, because it's so forgiving.  I can keep them in the over until rest of dinner is ready:  asparagus, cauliflower, onion wedges, brussels sprouts, potatoes, etc.  Never had a bad roasted veggie!!",
