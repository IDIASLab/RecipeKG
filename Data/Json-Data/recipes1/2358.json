I found I had to find my own way through the directions, it states cook time 1 hour, I found that 30 min. is plenty (I am using a baking stone).  Also regarding step 4, when you separate it and place it back in the bowl to rise once again it becomes one round of dough, so why separate it?  The second time I made it I skip the separating part but did punch down and let rise again, then separated it into loaves after the second rising.  Now in step 6, where it says to turn occasionally, I just skipped that step all together because I found that step too awkward and as far as \"done when golden brown\" well after 30 minutes of baking the loaves are closer to dark brown, and I'm only baking it in half the designated time.  I really like the taste of this bread and after playing with this recipe several times I now have no problems but I did the first few times I made it.  It seems others didn\u2019t have any problems but I did, so for what it\u2019s worth these are just some of the problems I encountered.",

                "reviewBody": "Good recipe, works well if you add a little italian seasonings in with the ingredients.    As a culinary student I've tried and failed with bread many times before getting some decent results.  Here's what I've found that may help some previous reviewers:  1) Proof your yeast as directed (mixing water, yeast, & sugar)-- if it doesn't start bubbling or frothing after 10 min, throw it out.  Either the yeast is dead (check expiration date) Or you killed it with HOT tap water > 120 degrees F kills yeast.  Optimal temp is LUKE warm around 100F.     2) Mist the bread with water every 3 min for the first 10 min.  Why?  This does 3 things.  Prevents the crust from forming too fast thus restricting the rising process.  It moisens the crust just enough so it doesn't brown/burn at the end of the baking period - you get a golden brown instead of a dark heavy crust.  And it  finally makes the crust crispier.  This is a very important step.  It also helps if you have a bowl of water in the oven to increase the humidity percentage.  Professional ovens have adjustable humidity controls which add moisture in.  Why only 10 min?  You can mist for longer but you'll end up with a thin white crust instead of golden brown.  Once the bread has risen to its full potential (within the 1st 10 min or so depending on the size of the loaf), then you want  it to start becoming golden brown.  UPDATE - Bake until internal temp is 200 F - whatever the shape or size.",

My first loaf was good, but after I read up a bit on proper dough handling, the flavor increased tenfold - it went from good to great bread.\n\nBring the ingredients together and let sit for 15 minutes before you knead to hydrate and relax.  After 15, knead like crazy until smooth like a baby's bottom. Coat with oil, place in a bowl, cover and let rise until doubled. \n\nINSTEAD OF KNEADING THE LIVING TAR OUT OF THE DOUGH, gently but firmly smoosh the dough out, fold in thirds and press with your palm, fold in thirds and press, fold in thirds and press.  Form a ball, coat, cover, and let rise again.  Divide into two or three loaves (we prefer two larger loaves), fold and press again and shape for final rise.  \n\nScore the loaves, spritz 'em with water, and slide 'em on into the oven.  Pour some water into a preheated pan under the loaves for steam and quickly shut the door (no need for opening and spritzing!).  A baking stone REALLY helps with the crust texture.  I also love using those perforated \"professional\" loaf pans (sans cornmeal, of course).\n\nBetter handling DOES equal better flavor! The difference is amazing!!!",

The flour for a bread recipe is always a variable.  Depending on the humidity in the weather and protien content in your flour, the flour can fluxuate 2-3 cups.  I put in 9 cups of flour to get it to be a stiff dough. That is what was meant when she said knead it until it is smooth as a baby's bottom.  Italian breads, pizza doughs, and french breads should never be sticky. Stick with this rule and your family will love your bread and your house will smell great. Best of all you will have really super yummy bread for dinner for really cheap!!!  I made all three loaves and they were gone in an evening.",

PROOFING YEAST: put water, sugar in bowl. Sprinkle yeast on top. Let it sit 2-3 mins until it gets bubbly and smells like bread. Then proceed as directed. FIRST RISE: this took 1 Hour in my oven with the light on. PUNCH DOWNS: Gently punch down, remove from bowl onto lightly floured surface. Don't knead it again, just get the air bubbles out. Put back in bowl as directed. Again placed back in turned-off oven with light on.  This SECOND RISE took 30 mins. SECOND PUNCH DOWN: same as above, but don't put back in bowl. Form into loaves as directed (I made two). Place cornmeal only under the bread loaves because excess not underneath will burn when you start cooking it. FINAL RISE: loaves covered with towel, again in \"off\" oven.. this took 30 mins or so. Then I put on counter and heated up oven(s) to 450 for baking. It took 20 mins to cook them. Very delicious, crispy crust (not crisp today but still wonderful). Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!! ",

You can add more, of course, but then you don't get a truly authentic texture to your bread. For the lucky people out there with bread machines or a food processor with a dough hook to do the kneading, this problem is fairly easily solved.

I pulled off chunks of the dough, lightly rolled it in my palms to make it smooth, let rise as stated and baked for about 20 minutes, misting every 5. After 10 minutes I turned the rolls upside down to finish baking.  WOW were these every AWESOME as rolls!!!! I will be making these again and again!! Thanks!",
