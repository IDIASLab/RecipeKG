The flavor and texture were superb.  I added 1 extra banana, replaced applesauce for the oil, and 1/2 tsp. salt.  They were wonderfully moist with a great banana flavor.  I think 3 bananas is the way to go...most recipes call for 3 ripe ones.  I didn't have nuts or choc. chips but had butterscotch chips.  Oh wow!  These really made the recipe.  The combination of flavors was great.  1 tsp. of cinnamon is just enough to add a layer of flavor...it enhances the bananas and does not overpower.  Because the batter is nice and thick, nuts or chips won't sink to the bottom.  Came out beautifully golden brown.  Made these into muffins and made 18.",

They weren't heavy on my stomach and still gave me the banana flavor I wanted. I was planning on freezing half of them but they disappeared so fast I didn't get a chance too.
