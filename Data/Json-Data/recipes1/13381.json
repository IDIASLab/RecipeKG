Some enhancements I made that you might consider: using all butter instead of part shortening, part butter; using a good commercial egg nog to replace the milk (I used Old New England brand egg nog that has booze added; find at wine shops and liquor stores).  Also NOTE--the recipe time is definitely wrong for a loaf pan of this size.  At most you're looking at 50 min. baking time.  All in all a recipe that could be spectacular with some tinkering........",

I added a cup of rum-soaked dried berries (blueberry, cherry, cranberry). I baked in a bundt pan rather than a loaf pan, and watched cooking times very carefully.  The results were delicious -- this was a hit at the day-after-christmas-breakfast with my family.  Thanks!",

I also carefully watching the baking time and at around 50 minutes the tooth pick came out clean all over the cake so I took it out of the oven. However after the cake cooled it practically crumbled when I cut it and yet there were still mini lumps of flour mixture inside the cake despite mixing thoroughly. I also didn't think it tasted much like egg nog even though I used it! Sorry too bland and time consuming for a not-so-great result.",
