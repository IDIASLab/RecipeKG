I was just needing the topping for my standard for brownies (Baker's Choc. 1 bowl brownie). I also vote NOT to use a mix for these mixes are good and serve their purpose but the consistency is not the same and this brownie (or the Baker's) recipe is super easy and doesn't take much longer than a mix. The mint filling was great good amount of mint similar to peppermint patties. I let this sit in the fridge for a couple hours then popped it in the freezer for about 10-15 mins before topping with the chocolate. The freezer made sure that the layers stayed separate and chilled the choc layer nicely. The unsweetened choc was good it broke the sweetness just enough. I did need to make more than called for (and I only made a 9x13) I used 4 squares instead of 3 and that was just enough could have made it thicker but it really wasn't needed. Everyone loved these and I will definitely make them again. Thanks for sharing!",

They are like a brownie with the unique topping of a mint frosting layer followed by a thin chocolate glaze. If you like chocolate and mint together you will probably like these bars! The next time I make these I will line my pan with foil because they tend to stick to my greased and floured pan. Make sure they are THOROUGHLY chilled before cutting them or they won't cut well. They are picture-perfect if you can cut them cleanly.",

The chocolate layer almost has the consistency of fudge and I usually have to bake it for several minutes longer than the suggested time. I cool the brownie layer completely before pouring on the mint layer then chill for the suggested hour before adding the glaze. I learned the hard way that this is an extremely important step or else you don't get the perfect layers. If I let the bars chill overnight I usually take them out of the fridge and let them sit for at least 15 minutes before cutting or else the top layer cracks. Absolutely delicious!",

To my surprise it was incredibly moist (and stayed that way). It had a different consistency than I normally like for my brownies but it worked perfectly for these brownies with layers on top. I think next time I would add a bit of salt (or use salted butter) vanilla and increase the mint by 50% (but only because I tend to like tons of flavor not because it was truly lacking anything). I did chicken out and use a couple of tablespoons of sugar and a dash of milk in the top layer (still quite bitter) but I imagine it is good without.",
