If this recipe were for the cookies alone I would have given it 5 stars. I would recommend adding the baking soda to the flour before adding it to the mix and I was slightly scared by how crumbly the mixture was but with a little heat from my palms it stuck together and turned out great. As my husband said they taste like chocolate chip cookies without the chocolate chips. Thanks!",

THe kids loved them their kids loved them I got exactly 24 cookies just like the yield suggested. They were fabulous so soft and chewy. I am making these for Valentines day for my sons class and I am going to use red food coloring in the icing! Will definately keep this recipe thank you. Oh yea I used shortening instead of butter. I always get a softer cookie that way.",
