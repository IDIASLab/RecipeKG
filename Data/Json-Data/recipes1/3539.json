Make sure you keep stirring and give it time. This soup is great because it's creamy and thick while still being low-fat. I tend to add a good amount of black pepper and garlic powder and it makes a big difference. Just a touch of cheese on the top and it's a filling meal that everyone enjoys.",

Instead of water I used chicken broth and did about 1 1/2 cups. I also scratched the celery and used broccoli and took out the powdered milk and used red potatoes. At the end after I added the flour/milk mixture I also added a handful of grated sharp cheddar cheese and a little garlic. I do have the gritty taste others were mentioning but I think that is due to the potatoes sitting for so long...as a potato lover I can't complain though!",

Next time I would like to try using chicken broth instead of water to boil the vegetables. We enjoyed this recipe. I will make it again.",
