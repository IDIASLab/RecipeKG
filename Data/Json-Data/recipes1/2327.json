I also used less only a generous 1/2t. of cinnamon and a 1/4t. of clove.  I used a 12 oz. box of fresh mushrooms and sliced them very thin.  I did not have fresh bread crumbs so I substituted instant mashed potato flakes, stirring after each addition until the meat mixture was lightly bound.\n\nThe flavor and fragrance of this pie is seductive.  It makes an impressive (and easy to prepare)party dish. \n\nWe will defintely be making this again and again!",

I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand: Thyme for savory leek and peeled diced apple for the mushroom and chicken stock for beef stock. I don't care for parley so I left it out. The previous time I had tortiere my only complaint about it was that it seemed heavy on the cinnamon so I followed another reviewer's advice and halved it. It seemed just right to me. It was moist flavorful. NOt a diet special but true comfort food.",

Instead of using the listed spices I chose to use the blend 'Tourtiere Spices' from AR with the addition of allspice. I also used regular bread crumbs (though fresh would've been better- I was in a hurry though) and curly parsley. Overall it is much better than the commercially prepared version. The celery seemed a little out of place and I feel that the seasoning should have been put on the meat directly while cooking to infuse the flavour.",

I am not familiar with putting mushroom celery parsley cinnamon or breadcrumbs in it. I could not even make it it sounded so foreign to me. so my three stars should be taken with a grain of salt. The review probably not fair but the recipe is nothing like the tourtiere that I remember my mother and all the ladies in the neighborhood making. They used mashed potatoes the seasonings were thyme sage dry mustard and ground cloves.",
