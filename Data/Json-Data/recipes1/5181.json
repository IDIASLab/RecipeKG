I also did not have chocolate squares so I used 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa. I mixed this together and cooked in a double boiler. I did add 1 tbsp of butter to the mixture and cooked until it was thick (probably 30 minutes or so and stirred often so it wouldn't burn). I did not add water. This is a FABULOUS icing over a bundt cake. The chocolate icing was not too sweet which we liked and it looked so pretty. Drizzle the icing over a cooled cake while still warm as my icing was pretty thick. I will definitely make this icing again!",
