I made this recipe one that is exactly the same but with orange juice instead of cherry juice and one with sweetened condensed milk instead of the marshmallow creme and with lemon juice. By far the cherry was the most flavorful and most attractive. The orange was a nice alternative but the lemon left a lot to be desired. In the future I will use the cream cheese and marshmallow creme as a base and simply try different juices. I used the actual fruits (cherries an orange slice and a lemon slice) to adorn the dip so that the party-goers knew what flavor they were dipping their fruits into. This is also a great recipe to have one's children help make. Oh and warming the cream cheese and the marshmallow creme before mixing made all the difference. Enjoy!",

I halved the recipe thinking he would probably just nibble on it and not really make a dent in the concotion. Can I be the first day say I pretty much consumed the whole batch myself and sent my son off to school with a little container of it. This stuff was SO delicious. I had mine with strawberries and my son had his with apples. I had to add a lot more of the cherry syrup because I wanted the pinkish color and a slight cherry flavor. This was a hit with my family! Especially with me for its easy prep and delicious results! Thank you so much Natalie!!",
