Good banana flavor, hearty texture because of the oats and nuts, and a crunchy brown sugar topping. Muffin tin sizes vary, so you may get more or less than 12 muffins--just remember to fill the muffin cups 3/4 full.",

A solid three or four with the subs, I have no trouble believing they'd be 5 star if left alone.",

Perhaps I would reduce the cooking time for the muffins a bit next time. I also used whole oats rather than grinding them, as I don't own a food processor, and it was terrific - gave it great hearty texture. The crumbles on top are amazing, everyone loved them! These were an overwhelming hit. Highly recommend--thanks for a great recipe! ",

I substituted white whole wheat flour (you could also use ww pastry flour or plain whole wheat) for all the all purpose - subbed extra banana for 1/2 the butter and nonfat plain yogurt instead of the sour cream. The nuts are definitely optional as is the topping. They are also plenty sweet with only 3/4 cup of sugar. Also remember the baking soda - it's not in the directions! My kids gobble these up!

I liked the idea and taste of the ground oats, makes them more dense. As I don't have any muffin cases I made these in smaller bun cases and only cooked them for 20 minutes. I didn't top them just sprinkled them with brown sugar (again for health reasons). Absolutely delicous and tasted very much like professional muffins. I lovely change to banana bread.

This last time I made them I actually substituted half the butter with coconut oil and what was great became out of this world! Since I use really ripe bananas I usually cut back a little on the sugar. I use 1/2 cup white and 1/4 cup brown. The only other subsitution I make is with the use of pecans rather than walnuts. I have already shared this recipe with many and will continue to do so! Thanks for this great recipe!",

Increase bananas by 1/2 cup. Add 1 tablespoon molasses (incredible). Substitute 1/2 cup of white sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar. Substitute 1/2 cup all-purpose flour with 1/2 cup whole wheat stone ground flour (next time I'll substitute completely with wheat flour) Omit topping. I baked this in a loaf pan for almost an hour (checking at 45 minutes.) I do have to thank AAMMEGAN for the base of this recipe though. I'd like to also try substituting the banana for pumpkin.",
