While reading the recipe I was thinking there ought to be some more acid in it such as lemon juice then I saw many of the comments suggest it. So I added about 1/2 teaspoon or maybe less of lemon juice. I also saw how many people thought the honey was too much and I'd like to make an assertion: The recipe doesn't say what type of flaked coconut to use but I went with caution and used unsweetened organic coconut and I think it is meant to be that way. I can't imagine how unbearably sweet this would be with sweetened shredded coconut. I ended up using about 2 Tablespoons of honey. I generally don't love avocado (I find it gross-to-\"meh\" most of the time) but this recipe changes everything. I have found a fantastic way to enjoy this once unexciting food!",
