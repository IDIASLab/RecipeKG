When I seasoned the chicken I treated the adobo like it was salt (sprinkle VERY lightly). Also I used a small red bell pepperbin place of the pimentos, and rinsed off some capers in place of the alcapparado. You can put the frozen peas in the rice before you pour the water in. I also increased the rice to 2 cups and used about 3&3/4) cups of water. It was so easy and came out great.",
