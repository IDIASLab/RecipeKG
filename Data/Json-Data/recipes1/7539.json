I line a 9 x 13 pan with parchment paper and spray it with pam. When you pour the hot candy into the pan do not spread it. It will spread itself and let cool completely for about 1 hour before you remove it. After it has cooled remove from pan and remove parchment. Break into pieces. Dip into chocolate.This recipe does work if you follow the directions. Also invest in a candy themometor.",

After a long hard search for a good \"Seafoam\" candy recipe (not to mention three batches that turned out more like divinity than what I was trying to make) I have found it! After breaking the candy into pieces I dipped them in chocolate like you would get if you bought this at the store. Yummy! By the way to the people who complained about this being \"too hard\": it's supposed to be hard! That's why you cook it to the hard crack stage. One hint is to line your pan with foil and butter or spray it well so you can just lift the candy out when it's set.",

I scaled the recipe to 1 would put it in for 11 second intervals stirring after each one. for those who like it crunchy i put it over ice n those who like it chewy can wait for it to be cool enough to handle. Incredibly quick and easy! Wonderful maple flavor and you can play around with temperature and cooling time to alter consistancy.",
