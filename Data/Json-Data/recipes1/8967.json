However this recipe is basically good because the addition of garlic powder and pepper is brilliant (careful with salt - think of all that bacon!) I made it with 1 cup mayo 1 cup lite sour cream and 1/2 cup softened reduced fat cream cheese (neufschatel)to make it a little \"stiffer.\" I mixed those three ingredients and sprinkled garlic powder and pepper across the top and mixed well. I didn't mix the solids into it ahead because I knew the bacon would get mushy and the tomatoes might water the dip. I also seeded the tomatoes. I mixed everything and spread it on a flat round tray and sprinkled some shredded iceburg on the top. I used lightly salted pita points to serve. Toast points would be yummy but lots of work and not necessary. Bagel \"chips\" would be good too.",

I cook the bacon well and break it into pieces but keep them large enough to be recognizable. Since it's BLT dip you don't want bacon \"crumbs.\" You don't need any additional salt. The bacon adds enough on its own. I skip the garlic too. Think about it... you don't put garlic on a BLT sandwich. It overpowers the BLT flavor. For tomato I use the giant cherries (or other less liquidy tomato) and just cut them up. Chopping would bring out too much moisture. The equivalent of one tomato is not nearly enough. Add tomato until it's to your liking. Serving with pita or bagel chips is far better than using bread but it is great with toast points.",

Right before serving I stirred in one package of already-shredded lettuce. I did taste it and I added a little more garlic powder after tasting. We really enjoyed this. I didn't have white bread but I did have whole wheat so I toasted that and cut it into points and also opened a box of Wheat Thins and we ate that with this dip as well.
