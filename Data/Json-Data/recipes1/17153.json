When the onions and edges of bananas were lightly brown and the pan was extremely hot I poured in a lite coating of coconut milk then did it again until all the bananas were covered with a lite creamy coating of the milk then I seasoned with salt and Adobo. Let me tell you we went WILD over them. They were AWESOME. This is my new picnic food instead of potato salad! Much more nutritious!",

Boiled green bananas taste closer to potatoes than ripe bananas so I'm sure you could use russet potatoes as a substitute yukon gold would be fine too.\n\nMake sure to use coconut milk or coconut cream. Almost had a huge mistake of using Cream OF coconut which is a common ingredient for pina colada NOT this savory dish.\n\nIn a pinch, using onion power and french fry seasoning can really make the coconut milk sauce bring out a salty/savory taste.    \n\nI love to slice the bananas once they are cooked but need to wait for them to cool more.  Overall a very filling dish that tastes like a mini-vacation to the Pacific!",
