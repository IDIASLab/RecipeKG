To reduce your vinegar, pour into a small saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat constantly stirring to prevent scorching the vinegar. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the vinegar has reduced by half. Set aside, and cool to room temperature.  When ready to serve, drizzle over the appetizer.  For different variations/flavor try adding garlic, red pepper flakes, etc., while reducing.  Note:  the vinegar will naturally sweeten as it reduces and will keep for months properly stored.",

I didn't halve the cherry tomatoes - I thought they looked prettier whole. The fresh mozzarella balls are called bocconcini and are packed in a watery brine. They're worth seeking out to make these.",

Because it looked so good and I did not follow the directions perfectly I will try again. Next time I will use small squares of mozzarella and not marinade or add until time to serve. Should be a quick and easy fix. I will also drizzle with olive oil sparingly just before serving. At that point I will update my review.",
