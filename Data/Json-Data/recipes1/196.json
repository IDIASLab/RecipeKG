Just a quick tip: if you want the texture of the Italian butter cookies from the bakery that are chocolate dipped with sprinkles on one side substitute half the all-purpose flour with cake flour and bake 2-3 minutes longer. It adds that iconic crumbly texture and is absolutely to-die-for- when you sandwich with your favorite jelly/preserves in between. My Favorite!",
