There are not even seasonings used here, but the burritos just have this incredibly full flavor - there is nothing missing!\r\n\r\nThese burritos are so incredibly easy, and this is one recipe I will keep on hand to use regularly.  The burritos are quite healthy, and the recipe uses nothing containing a lot of fat.  Thanks to Gary for providing a fantastic recipe!\r\n\r\nTwo hints:  1) To keep this recipe healthy when you make it, be sure to use skinless ground turkey, otherwise the skin is ground into the turkey and it contains extra fat; 2) If you are like me and are terrible at folding burritos, spread a little refried beans on the ends you are trying to fold - they act like a sticky paste to kee the burritos nicely folded.",

I used Rotel tomatoes instead of the hot tomato sauce, only because I couldn't find it.  I also wrapped the burritos, minus the sour cream, and placed them in the oven at 350 degrees for about 7-10 minutes.  The tortillas got nice and crunchy and the cheese was melted into the meat and beans.  I then topped them with the sour cream and served.  We will definitely be making these again.

I wanted to have more control over my spices. For those of you who don't know where to find the hot tomato sauce try the mexican foods aisle of your grocery store. I followed the advice of others adding tomato sauce diced tomatoes with chiles chili powder onion powder and ground cumin. I also added the refried beans directly to the meat mixture saving a step. This made so much I was able to freeze about half. Looking forward to eating it too!",
