I also replaces 1/4 of white sugar with brown sugar in the cookie dough. I made two dozen cookies and had just the right amount of filling. I debated adding a bit of frosting but my husband loved them just as they were. The dough was a bit soft but chilling for 30 minutes took care of that and I suspected my change could have contributed to it. Thanks Ginger. These are delicious.",
