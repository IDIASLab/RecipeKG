I cubed 4 small-medium potatoes but only boiled them maybe 9 minutes and then mixed them with the ham, one 11-oz can of mexi-corn, and \u00bd pkg frozen chopped broccoli. For the sauce, I cooked 1/4 cup chopped onions and two stalks of celery (sliced) in the 1/4 cup butter. To that, I added 1/3 cup of flour, 2 cups of milk, a few good shakes of pepper, maybe \u00bd tsp of garlic powder and \u00bd tsp of cayenne. I also added around a cup or so of shredded cheddar to make it a nice tasty cheese sauce. I mixed the sauce with the other ingredients, poured into a greased 9x13 dish, and topped with another 1\u00bd cups of cheddar. Awesome! Thanks again, Lindysue! I've found the way to prepare it for my family!",

Also add 1/2 cup melted Velveetta cheese after you add the above said mixture to the ham, potatoes, and corn.  I tossed everything in the casserole dish 1/2 way through cooking then added 1 cup of shredded cheese to the top of the casserole. Turned out just wonderful!!  I used quite a bit more pepper than the recipe called for, but WOW what a dish! WHole family loved it!  Don't be fooled with the spicy season all.  It won't make the dish too spicy or salty.  Just great!",

Be sure to use red or yellow potatoes for this, because baking potatoes don't have the right texture, which is important to this dish.  Also, try using a can of mexicorn for more color and flavor, and using pepperjack cheese instead of processed cheese.  Overall, a good recipe even as is.  Hubby asked for seconds (rare even with my good cooking skills).",

I chopped a whole onion in the food processor and saut\u00e9ed it olive oil until translucent. I then added 4 potatoes that I scrubbed and left the skin on and cut into cubes to the pan with the onions and then added a bit of fresh crushed garlic. I browned the potatoes on the stove and covered them I did not want them to get too done as they were still going to be baked. I then cut the ham into little pieces. I had leftover spiral ham so that was easy enough. Because I had about 4 cups of potatoes and 4 cups of ham I used 2 cups of milk and 16oz of Velveeta in the saucepan on the stove while the potatoes were cooking. While the mike and cheese were melting I added Hungarian paprika garlic powder onion powder & ground mustard to the cheese milk mixture. Once this was done I took the potatoes off the heat and put into a huge bowl and added the ham and I decided to add a bit of real cheese so I diced a bit of real sharp cheddar into the bowl and tossed everything together with a spatula. I then sprayed the 11 x7 pan and put in the mixture and then poured the cheese sauce on top and put into the oven. Now this was still way soupy. I used double the ingredients that the recipe called for and only 1/4th as much milk and it was still soupy so I let it bake uncover for an hour and for the last 15 mins I added bread crumb",
