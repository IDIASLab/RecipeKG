                "reviewBody": "I just wanted to add a note here for everyone that you can substitute the butter for 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil and it tastes great! Or you can do This classic sauce of sauteed butter, parsley and lemon juice is fantastic. Definitely saute the garlic or else it will taste too raw, even after it's baked. I have used this sauce for almost all types of fish- true cod, halibut, basa, tilapia, sole, trout, and salmon. All tasted superb. ALWAYS increase the garlic. For 4 filets, I use 3 large cloves, 3-4 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoon lemon juice. Just make sure you always have less lemon juice than butter or else it will taste too lemony -even when doubling/tripling it. For a large filet of salmon, I triple the amount. Lightly salt and pepper the fish for more flavor and I sometimes add 2-3 tablespoon of buttered bread crumbs or finely crushed (buttered) ritz crackers for an extra crunch. And of course, fresh parsley is better than dried and use real butter, never margarine. 3 stars for original recipe, 5 stars for slight alterations. Simple and flavorful marinade that still lets the flavor of the fish shine through. TIP- do NOT bake for 30 min, especially tilapia, which is so thin. High temperature, quick cooking time is a rule of thumb for all fish. For this, I did 400*f., for 10-12 min (at most!). If filets are super thin, try 8-10 min. I like it thank's for the recipe to play with. Grpa",

Pour it in  pan, boil it and reduce it slighly for a few minutes before adding a pinch of cornstarch to thicken it up to a glaze.   I drizzled this over my end product and voila!   Amazing.   And it adds the mildest flavor or orange.   I'm not sure you'd taste any orange otherwise and I marinated it over night.  (Would I even bother wth that step next time?   Hmmmm...)  The grocery store did not have tilapia at the tme, so I picked up a pound of filet of sole.   Worked great.   Sole is super thin, so I broiled it start to finish for about 5 minutes.   Toasts the crust up nicely as well.    If you're a garlic lover -- triple it.   If you're a salt person, this will need a sprinkling of that as well at the end.  A really wonderful and light fish dinner.",

I marinated the fish for 4 hours poured additional OJ over the fish before the topping went on and it went into the oven and I found there was no orange flavor at all...real disappointment. If I were to make this again I wouldn t mix the chopped basil into the topping rather sprinkle it on after the fish came out of the oven which I think will ramp up the flavor a bit. Also I baked for 15 minutes the topping hadn t browned at all so I put it under the broiler briefly to get some color and give it some eye appeal. Of course I then ended up overcooking the fish. If I were to make this again I d probably cook the fish for about 12 minutes allowing for some time under broiler to brown the topping and then not overcooking the fish. It wasn t bad it simply didn t have much flavor and it wasn t really good either.. SuperN sorry wish I d been able to give your recipe a better review.",
