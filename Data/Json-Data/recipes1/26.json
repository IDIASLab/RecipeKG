We make up a runny confection sugar glaze in a large bowl with 10x sugar, milk and flavoring.  We dump a bunch of the cookies in, place them briefly on racks to drain most of the excess glaze, and then place them on wax paper sheets to dry.  After a couple hours, we turn them over to let the bottom dry.  Greeeaaattt cookies!",

I just made a batch of these for a party and they were a BIG hit.. and my sister thought they even tasted better and lighter than my mom's! (a VERY big compliment!). I used anise flavoring and a little vanilla since that's the taste I remember growing up on. And after rolling dough with my hands into a rope about 6\" long I put one end over the other (like a ribbon). 10 min on parchment paper worked perfectly each time. (just a light golden brown on bottom and cookie top is very white-- which is deceiving. Glad I wasn't tempted to continue baking them!) After cooling I mixed conf. sugar milk and anise extract (a little lemon extract too) and put a light glaze on 'em using my fingers..then colored sprinkles. They looked great and tasted even better.. THANKS SOOOO much for this recipe that I intend to use for many years to come!",
