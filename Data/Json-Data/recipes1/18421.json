While I was looking for a granola that would set into big pieces that could be grabbed as a snack to go.  When I realized this granola was not setting in the oven I started topping with honey and then light corn syrup when the honey ran out.  I added enough to get the effect but I will go back to my old recipe.  Also, I always bake with the dried fruit mixed in, I actually like it better.  The fruit plumps and sticks to the oat mixture when you bake it in.",
