I did cut the butter down to 1/4 cup, added a splash of sherry, a couple dashes of hot sauce.  I also added some old bay seasoning with the cracker crumbs when breading the scallops.  I put the cracker crumbs, old bay, and garlic power in a plastic bag.  Add the scallops and shake to coat then press any remaining loose crumbs into the scallops.  If you spoon the liquid over the scallops you won't wash the crumb mixture off them.  Baked as suggested but the last 2 minutes remove and sprinkle with parmesan cheese and broil the last 2 minutes.  Will be making this one as often as possible.",

I followed some of the previous suggestions and cut the butter & wine in half.  I just drizzled a little over the scallops right before I put them in the oven. They were not \"swimming\" in the liquid so I didn't have problems with them being too mushy like some reviewers mentioned.  I also turned the broiler on for a couple of minutes right before I took them out of the oven.  I think it works best to use fine cracker crumbs.  Mine had a great flavor, they were gold brown but not crispy like a  fried scallop.  Thanks for an good and easy recipe.  My husband has already said he would like me to make these again.",

I didn't have buttery crackers around, so I substituted for multi-grain Club crackers and added crushed red pepper flakes and garlic powder to the cracker mix and coated the scallops in a Ziplock baggie.  I cooked them at the suggested 350 for 12 mins and then broiled for about 4 mins and they were done and browned perfectly.",

I followed other suggestions and doubled the wine and lemon juice, and added fresh garlic instead of the powder.  Perfect!  What I would also suggest is NOT adding more cracker crumbs to each scallop - I scooped up extra crumbs and put them in the pan - turned out soggy (my fault!).  I used Snackwell's cracked pepper crackers, and added 1/8 tsp salt - and used only 2 Tbl butter.  The flavor was wonderful!  Thanks so much for the recipe!",
