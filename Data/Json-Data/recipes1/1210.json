They should come out super soft like fine sand and just hold together. In Spain they are traditionally wrapped after baking and you SQUEEZE the cookie before unwrapping so it holds together.

Honestly, I think it's just a personal preference thing....that's why you should read more than one review right?\n\nFollowed the recipe exactly and turned out great..HOWEVER... like others have said, it is not necessary to make that large of the cinnamon mixture.  Just make the balls first..., eye your cookie balls and just guess logically how much sugar you should use...it's pretty obvious not a whole cup.\n\nWeird how people complain or like that it's doughy.  People shouldn't even mention that! It's obvious that you should've baked it longer or less based your preferences. My first batch turned out dry (baked too long) and so my second batch I baked it shorter. My point is...this cookie CAN be dry.\n\nThis recipe is worthy of making again in the future!
