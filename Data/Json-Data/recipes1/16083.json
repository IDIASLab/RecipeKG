I added the following: 4T of pesto (instead of 2), 1 t minced garlic & 1 t white wine to the pesto mix.  I layered in with the chicken: 1/2 a chopped onion, 1/2 a roasted pepper (chopped), mushrooms.  Amazing!!!!  Don't forget to sprinkle the chicken breasts with some salt and pepper.  Next time I'm thinking I'll add some grilled asparagus (anything to get more veggies in our diet!) Thanks for the excellent starting point!",

Finally, I added some garlic and diced sun-dried tomatoes to the mixture.  It came out so good my fiance complimented the recipe about 4 times while we were eating!  Delicious!",

Instead of putting the ingredients on top, I split the chicken breasts in have and stuff them. Also added shredded mozzerella, mushrooms, and onions. We at with a side of mashed potatoes.

Well, this is the 2nd time I've made it this week.  It's a keeper.  I basically made as written the first time and the 2nd time I added chopped garlic and then at the end, a bit of feta cheese on top.  Both times I served it with jasmine rice.  The next time I make it I will add pine nuts.  It works well as written but also is fun to add variations.  This is a great weeknight meal but I will serve this for company.
