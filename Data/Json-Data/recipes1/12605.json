I used a clean empty pancake syrup bottle to squeeze out the funnel cakes easily into the oil. Saw them use that at Knott's Berry Farm actually. Topped with powdered sugar strawberries (mixed with white sugar) and whipped cream. AMAZING! I'll never be able to spend money on them at theme parks and fairs again!",
