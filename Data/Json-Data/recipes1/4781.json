What a fabulous outcome! Even made my dad proud !!!!(pie making is a dying art in my family that he has completely mastered... the women who cook and alter recipes tend not to do so well in this department, but this was a real winner!).\n",

I used 2% milk which I don't know if this recipe was intended for whole milk.  I will try this again with whole milk to see if this corrects the problem.  Any suggestions?",

I found that 1 cup was the perfect sweetness. I brushed the pie crust around the edges with beaten egg (to result in a \"pretty\" baked crust) and covered the edges with strips of foil after the first 15 minutes of baking (to prevent over browning). The custard is delicious and so EASY to make. It's very very tasty and I will make this again for sure. Thanks, Lesley !",
