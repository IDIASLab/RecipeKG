So instead after dipping the balls in chocolate I sprinkled them with the nuts and kind of pushed the nuts around the sides. This was not my favorite recipe for peanut butter balls. I thought the addition of honey made them too sweet. Also I thought the walnuts were a bit odd on a peanut butter ball. I think salted peanuts would have been good on them and the salt would have been a nice contrast with how sweet they are.",

It gave just as much nut flavor without worry of the elderly or children getting chocked on the chunks of nuts. I also made theese a second time cutting the amount of shortening in half and cooking the chocolate melts (milk) until just before it reached the soft ball stage and added the super fine chopped walnuts to the chocolate mixture before dipping the balls. It was amazing just be careful with chocolate melt you wont need to add any sugar because it is already very sweet.",
