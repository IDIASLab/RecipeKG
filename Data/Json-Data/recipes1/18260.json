Made a couple of changes -used leftover Pork Chops cubed instead of Ham (not a big Ham fan) -added Sesame seed oil to finish as I didn't have any sesame seeds on hand -added Firm Tofu (cubed to same size as pork chops) -used EVOO for oil. Otherwise followed it exactly. Results were good. Servings are small if using this for a main dish. Agreed with other reviewers that it probably needed more veggies if it is to be a main dish. Rice Vinegar was a nice touch as it gave flavour without adding too much sodium. I topped my servicing with Sriracha/hot sauce as I like it spicier. All in all a very healthy meal.",

I left out the vegetable oil since there's plenty of fat in the pork then sauteed the pork into very fine pieces for about 10 minutes first. Then add an entire bunch of diced green onions and one medium red pepper and 6 cloves of garlic. After it's done I put half of it aside for the empanadas and add the quinoa to the other half in the pan. This gives a little more meat in the quinoa which is never bad. Next time I'll brown the garlic for just a minute to get more flavor from it.",
