I think it would be better without the mozzarella, which just took away from the taste of the shrimp.  There are so many appetizer recipes with cheese that I'd just prefer that you tasted the shrimp more.",

I did change it up a bit using sour cream in the base along with the cream cheese to make it more \"dip\" friendly. I used the frozen shrimp as suggested and also removed the tomatoes and the mozz. cheese from the dip. It was great! I would make it again. A word to the wise my wife thought thre was too much cocktail sauce so perhaps cutting back would be a good suggestion. Wonderful thanks for the recipe!",
