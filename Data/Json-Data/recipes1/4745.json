Instead of cheddar cheese I used one brick of mild cheddar one brick of hot pepper cheese and a bag of kroger shredded pepper jack cheese. Also instead of the tomatoes I used 1/2 jar of mild salsa and added a couple tablespoons of diced green chilies on top of that. With using the salsa you do NOT need to use the chicken broth at all. Also I used a 16 oz package of the corn tortilla's - gave it a great flavor. Family absolutely LOVED it and my son ate the leftovers for breakfast this morning. I like a lot of cheese and so does my family. The recipe's amount would not do for us.",
