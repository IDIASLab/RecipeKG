But I always add something green, usually chopped green onions and place 4-5 stalk on top befor baking to make it visually appealing.  You can also add chopped can chiles or diced pimentos (in a jar) for great color.  And using low fat sour cream tastes exactly the same too.  But after 5 years, and using 3 different ovens, this dish always takes about 50-55 min. to bake, not 45 min.  Can also make ahead and refridgerate before you need to bake, just let it sit at room temperature for at least 30-45 min.  Great for making ahead for a dinner party.

We think that it reminds us of hushpuppies so we call it \"Hushpuppy Casserole.\" The first time I made this I added the extra water from the canned corn, as suggested.  That made it overly moist.  This time I poured in only half of the corn water and we both thought the dish was better (it was a little firmer).  I agree that real butter is the best (but the first time I used margarine, and it tasted fine!) My mother-in-law suggested adding bacon, too. I find, depending on the dish, it might take longer to bake than you were planning on. Still, nothing beats this dish--YUM!",

I make it with only 3 TBSP melted butter and 1 egg, plus 1/2 cup chopped onion.  This makes it lighter and more savory. I bake it at 350 for 1 hour.  Another plus to this recipe is when I make it for Thanksgiving I double it and put it in my 9x13 Pyrex portable glass pan with a microwaveable warmer.  I make it earlier, then bring a great side dish that doesn't require valuable oven space!",

Swish it around until the butter covers the entire bottom of the dish.  Mix together the other ingredients (omitting the 1/2 cup of butter) and just pour over the top of the butter without mixing. This is the same concept as the cobbler recipe I have seen and used.  Then, just bake it uncovered until it puffs up and is nicely browned on the top. The butter gives it a crispy texture and is delicious.  I have doubled this recipe also.  Last time, I even added one egg and it didn't seem to really make that much difference. IT will be all gone I can guarantee it!! I think I baked mine almost an hour the last time. If yo double it, it may take a little longer.  Good Luck!",
