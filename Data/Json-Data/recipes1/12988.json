I don't have a bread machine, so I just kneaded it until smooth, oiled it a little and let it rise about an hour an a half before finishing it following the recipe.  My family loved it and the kids were so cute with their little noses pressed to the oven window watching it puff up like a balloon, they got a real kick out of that!  Thanks for the great recipe! One tip I did was to put my oven on 500, the hotter, the better, and after it puffed up like a balloon, flipped it on the other side so it could brown a little for another half minute or so before removing it. Otherwise, the first piece didn't brown at all on top and I thought it looked prettier with some browning on both sides.  If you leave it too long to brown, it will start to toast and get crunchy so be careful of that.",

This is as good as the store bought one. The only thing is that home ovens just don't have the high and even heat needed to cook the bread quickly to golden brown without drying it. So I cook it until it is just begining to brown then take it out while it is still moist. When I want to eat one loaf, I use a toaster oven to heat it and brown it quickly. Also the toaster oven will repop it for the stuffing to go in.",

After the first few I cooked the bread for only 4 minutes and that did the trick. I think even less time or lower temp (my oven runs hot) would work for a soft more 'foldable' bread. BTW I made the bread by hand and it worked great. Proofed the yeast in warm water with sugar for about 15 minutes added the oil and then the dry ingredients. I kneaded for about 10 minutes and let the dough rise for about 30-40 minutes. Then baked.",
