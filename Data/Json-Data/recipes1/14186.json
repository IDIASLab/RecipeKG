There isn't a thing I would change. The cumin and the cinnamon really make this awesome. I normally save the marinade and then boil it. I serve it with the fish. Goes great on basmati rice, particularly with all the chunks of roasted red pepper! I have serve this to guests and all have loved it.",

I think I might pass on this recipe maybe I didnt allow it to marinate long enough needs longer than an hour. The flavors of the cinnamon allspice and peppers didnt come through for us. I served it over Lime Rice and sauteed a few vegies as well. It dosen't sound or taste too mexican for this mexican. I will look for another Mexican Salmon or come up with my own.
