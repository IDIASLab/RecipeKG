Next the ham became too rubbery. So I now I boil chicken and shred it. I then boil the potatoes in the chicke water for about ten minutes. Then I mash them just slightly. This makes them much softer and adds to the texture of the chowder. Finally I add corn starch to thicken the broth. It sounds like a lot of work but really it's not. It makes fantastic chowder and I always double the recipe. That way I can freeze the leftovers and have anther meal or two on hand for those days when cooking seems like too much work!",

First, I used russet potatoes, but left the skins on for the extra nutrients and rustic feel.  I also added some chopped carrots and a couple of cloves of garlic, and used a whole bag of frozen corn.  I used chicken stock rather than water and did not cover the vegetables.  For spices, I added a good dose of kosher salt and black pepper, some ground sage, and a little crushed red pepper for a little kick.  After the 8 or so hours of cooking, I ladled about 3 cups of the stock out of the crock pot, made a roux, added the stock to it along with the condensed milk, let it thicken for about 4 or 5 minutes and then added it back to the crock pot and let it cook for another 30 minutes.  It was delightful!  Perfect for the snowy day we're having!!",

Used 1 can chicken broth in place of the bouillon cubes & water, added 1 can creamed corn, added 1 clove minced garlic, added 2 carrots diced.  I waited to add the ham until there was 3 hours left in cooking time so that it wouldn't' turn \"rubbery\" & that worked out great.  After adding the evaporated milk & allowing the 30 min additional cooking time, it was still a little too liquidy to be a chowder, so I added a corn starch slurry which thickened it up nicely!  It tasted good, but I felt it needed a little something, so I threw in a dash of rubbed sage & a dash of marjoram -- PERFECT!!  This was SO delicious!  Served w/ biscuits & we are looking forward to leftovers.  Thanks for the good starter recipe!  :)",

Next time like other reviewers I will use less water (or canned chicken broth) and real cream or half & half instead of evaporated milk. Loved the smell when I got home from work! I did all prep the night before; except potatoes so it was very easy in the morning. I plan on making this one again!",

The cooked ham was diced put to one side then mixed in with the soup along with a swirl of cream when serving. The other ingredients (excluding corn salt & evaporated milk) and using leeks when available were simmered in the bacon stock until cooked. This Potato & Ham soup was a family favourite. I have made it all my life but about 30 or so years ago when tinned corn became readily available I starting adding this sometimes for a change. I'm only giving this 4 stars because I don't think the diced ham can give anything like the strong bacony flavour of cooking your own on the bone!",
