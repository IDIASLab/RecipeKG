I sliced it up while cold (which I think is easier) right before assembling the sandwiches. I made my own honey mustard sauce with equal parts dijon mustard to honey. I didn't have a heavy iron skillet or a brick to keep the sandwich pressed while on the grill so I used my Pampered Chef rectangular baking stone which worked perfectly! We will be making these again! Yum!",

The first piece came off at 30 minutes and the last at 40 minutes each tested with a meat thermometer. We had half of the turkey for dinner the first evening and I refrigerated the rest for the sandwiches which I cooked in my panini pan (not on the grill). That simple little seasoning of cumin salt and pepper combined with inserting slivers of garlic into the breast resulted in incredibly tasty meat and a fantastic Cuban sandwich. I made the honey mustard from a recipe on this site. This sandwich is not the healthiest and is something that I would consider a splurge nutritionally but I would make it again (just not too often).",
