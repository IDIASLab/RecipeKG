I had a special request for fish soup from a very picky eater, so when I found this recipe, I thought it sounded good.  I was amazed!  And the crock pot did most of the work!  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned (the picky eater won't eat canned) and I used fresh mushrooms.  The picky eater gave this thumbs up, and after three bowls said that he wished he could eat more!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I will add this to my soup repetoire, as it is fabulous and wonderful for Lent!  I was also skeptical about the orange juice and I added it, and am so happy that I did!  This is a 10 Star recipe!",

Because I was in a bit of a hurry I cooked the soup in a pan on the stove top. Dang this was SO good! Don't forget some crusty bread to mop up the brothy goodness. Delicious! Thanks so much!",

And for the second version didn't have shrimps. anyway it turned out great both times. last thing we would say about it was bland.",

Added two potatoes small dice and a half can of white beans pureed to get a little fuller broth. Used red and yellow peppers instead of green no mushrooms or olives - don't judge just wasn't feeling it. I like a little spicier soup so added red pepper flakes and tabasco but the basic broth is really delicious so start with that. The orange juice added a very fresh taste but indiscernible. I used shrimp cod salmon and scallops all small dice and the flavors and textures were wonderful together. Made the broth the day before for ease and to let the flavors blend so 'day of prep' was a breeze. Try this - it's just really great. This is a very forgiving base recipe so have some fun with it.",
