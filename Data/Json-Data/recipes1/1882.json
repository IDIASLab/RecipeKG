I looked at some other recipes and I didn't see much difference except maybe more eggs, so I added another egg to the batter.  It took a little over 35 minutes to finish baking, but I ended up with a cake that tastes just like it came out of a box - which is what this is supposed to emulate.  My guess is that the other reviewers didn't use self-rising flour.  Remember the recipe for self-rising flour is 1 cup AP flour, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt.  Maybe the difference was the egg: anyway I got exactly what was advertised - within 5 minutes anyway.\r\n\r\nLater...\r\n\r\nI used the exact recipe this time (only 2 eggs) and it turned out as before - just as light and fluffy as a box cake.  The cook time is still 35 minutes for me.",

Changed the procedure as well after reading some articles and other reviews on the website. First make sure butter, eggs and milk are all room temp.  Sift together flour, sugar and salt, twice if you have the time. Combine all wet ingredients except butter. Whip up butter really well on its own. Then alternate dry and wet when adding to butter, taking care not to overmix at this stage.  I added choc chips and made cupcakes, came out great- really tender and moist- and actually tasted even better a day later.",
