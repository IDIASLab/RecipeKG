I halved the peppers (lengthwise), sauted onions separately along with 2 minced garlic pieces, cooked the rice separately, used 1 can of DICED tomatoes* (why would you ever buy a can of tomatoes and THEN dice them?), and mixed the ingredients together after browning the beef**, allowing them to warm slightly in the skillet before stuffing into the peppers.  You can use the extra juice from the can of tomatoes to keep the rice from burning.  I also added quite a bit of basil, oregano, and Italian seasoning, as well as extra Worcestershire sauce.  Putting just a little cheese in the bottom of each pepper helped as well.  Lastly, I only used one can of tomato soup.  Even cut in half, 25 min was needed to get them nice & hot.  Next time, I'll try adding some pepper as well.\r\n* Using a can of diced tomatoes with jalepeno peppers adds just the right amount of kick to these!  **You can also use 1/2 beef & 1/2 3-7% lean ground turkey to reduce fat content...tastes the same!",

Add a bit of tomato sauce and fill up the rest with beef mixture and top with tomato sauce again. The problem with only topping off the tomato sauce at the end was that it did not \"seep\" down as I expected it. So the top only had the tomato sauce and the bottom did not. Without the tomato sauce, the beef was kind of bland.",

I used ground turkey instead of beef, and a can of petite diced tomatoes w/ liquid instead of whole toms.  Used Arborio rice as that's what I had in the pantry.  Added minced garlic to the meat mixture. I substituted 1/2 C. of beef broth instead of plain water. Used 1 can of tomato soup & 1 sm. can of tomato sauce w/ a TBS or two of Spaghetti Sauce Seasoning.  Excellent, healthy, and much better than the stuffed peppers I had as a child.  I think that par-boiling the peppers before stuffing them was key to the texture and flavor.",

Used Uncle Ben's converted Rice, in my opinion it is the best rice in a box.  Used a large can of diced tomatoes, undrained.  Did not even use tomato soup, I don't think you need to.  After stuffing my peppers with the mixture, I just placed them right side up in a greased 9x13.  Biggest tip - boil your peppers for a good 5 minutes in the beginning, before stuffing them, and make sure they are fully submerged beneath the water.  If not, you will likely end up with pretty raw, crunchy peppers even after baking, unless you like to eat them that way.  One of my peppers was like this, it was the one that never got submerged when boiling. The main thing I love about this recipe -  you get your meat, starch, and green veggie all in one shot, and it is delicious and healthy!  Thank you.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a decent but very basic recipe.  Here are my thoughts.  First of all, don't cut the top off the pepper, it wastes too much pepper, cut it in half lengthwise.  The beef and rice stuffing is rather bland.  Easily liven it up by doubling (or more) the Worcestershire.  Fresh garlic adds to it as well.  Also, as others have already noted, adding some dried basil and/or oregano to the stuffing works well too.  And why in the world would you buy a can of whole tomatoes and then chop them?  Just use a can of diced tomatoes!  Don't use soup as the topping.  Use your favorite pasta sauce.  But if you do use the tomato soup, don't add water, it will just dilute what little flavor there is.  Simply pour the soup into a bowl, heat it a bit in the microwave and stir.  Viola, there's the gravy consistency the recipe calls for and no water needed.  After stuffing the pepper, ladle on the pasta sauce and then using a 2nd cup of cheese top each pepper.  You can then top the cheese with a sprinkle of dried oregano or Italian seasoning.  Happy eating!",

I also used sharp cheddar cheese.  Although there is rice in the peppers, we served over additional white rice so we could spoon the sauce over all.  Although we liked the meal, I feel it needs a little more \"umph\" to top it off.  It has great potential and I will probally make again only I'll play around with it to find the right blend to fully satisfy our tastebuds.",
