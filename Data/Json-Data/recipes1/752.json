Second, for a real spicy sweet bite, I added a TBS of cayenne pepper to the recipe--and everyone went crazy for them!",

To reduce to amount of fat I used 1 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce I don't think this changes the taste very much 'coz it's still excellent. I extended the baking time to 15 mins though since I find 10 mins baking leave the cookies too chewy. Thanks for the recipe!!",

Use 1 cup fresh minced ginger in addition to 1 cup crystalized ginger decrease powdered ginger by 1 teaspoon and replace with fresh ground black pepper add 1/2 teaspoon cloves. Amazing. If this is really for adults macerate the fresh ginger in a couple of tablespoons of vodka brings out yet another level of flavor.

I will definitely half it next time. When reading other reviews I noticed people talking about the expense of candied ginger. It's really easy to make at home. Cook 1 cup pureed ginger and 3 cups of sugar over medium-low heat. After the sugar melts you can add some ghee (clarified butter but regular butter will work too) and spices such as cardomom or allspice. Let the mixture boil for a few minutes while stirring constantly then pour into a shallow pan to set. YUMMY! We keep it on hand all the time for upset stomach.",
