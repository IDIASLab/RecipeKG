Because Carol referenced angel food cake (and because it has 8 egg whites!) I expected it to be lighter and fluffier. But mine came out quite dense like a pound cake. Perhaps I took too long folding in the egg whites but the batter was rather dense so it was difficult to incorporate the beaten egg whites. Also when she says \"tube pan \" I assumed she meant an angel food cake pan but I think this cake is more suited to a Bundt pan. Anyway I needed to use up some egg whites and sour cream so this recipe came in handy. I think the flavor is terrific (I love lemon and almond together!) but the texture is a bit too dense.",
