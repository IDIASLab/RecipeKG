She uses green bell pepper (and sometimes red too if she has it) instead of the jalapeno.  She also throws in about a half teaspoon of dill weed (really important!)  No need for fresh lemon (especially if that makes it too lemony for you) just a tablespoon of lemon juice will do.  In our family, nothing is more important than fish.  Believe me, if you only knew!

Will fix this regularly as we are trying to eat fish more often.\nI rarely have trout, but a nice way to perk up the flavor for any fish. If you want a good sauce try the one from Salmon Fillets with Creamy Dill, except keep it healthy by using plain yogurt intead of all that mayo.  Why would anyone go to the trouble to make something this healthy, then drown it in mayo?",
