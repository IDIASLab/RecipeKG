If you are having difficulty getting these cookies to set up the quick oats work much better. By design these oats make thicker faster oatmeal which will be replicated in the cookies. With a peanut allergy in the family I substitute an equal amount of freshly ground almond butter. It seems to give the cookies a bit more substance and is less sweet. I never thought I could improve on this recipe but the almond butter is an even bigger hit!",
