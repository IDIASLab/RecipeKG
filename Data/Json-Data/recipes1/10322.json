Even though I love green pepper, I don't feel it belongs in this recipe (just my opinion). I make homemade guacamole and put that layer on top of the sour cream/cream cheese layer.  I found a good guac recipe on this site (LuvAnn's Guacamole) that I use.  They always \"lick the platter clean\" every single time.  I've NEVER had leftovers.  I serve with Tostitos Scoops as they grab the dip more!  Oh and this doesnt' totally spread to fit in a 13x9 pan (mostly the beans don't) so I bought a clear pyrex dish a slightly smaller size.  This dish has pretty much become my 7-layer dip dish because it's requested so much at every party!  This is an awesome crowd pleaser.",

                "reviewBody": "Any time you combine these ingredients, you are going to get something pretty tasty. But I think this particular recipe has some issues. For instance, why mix cream cheese in with the sour cream? To me, that doesn't seem to add a lot, and it throws the proportions off (too much dairy). I'd rather mix the taco seasonings into the sour cream and forget the cream cheese. Why put the cheddar cheese at the very top instead of on the (presumably hot) refried beans, where it will get a little gooey? And if you're going to add multiple layers that look alike (e.g. diced tomatoes & salsa, or green pepper/green onions/lettuce), why put them together so they only look like one layer? There are better ways to order the layers.\n\nIf you make this and put lettuce in it, be sure to chop the lettuce very, very finely; otherwise you can't dip through the lettuce layer with any normal chip.\n\nI'd suggest finding another layer dip, or making modifications to this one. I wouldn't make it again as-is. It's not bad, but given that there are so many great recipes for layer dips out there, I wouldn't settle for one that's just \"not bad.\"",
