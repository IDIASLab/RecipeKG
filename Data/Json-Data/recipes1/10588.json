I don't normally like \"simple\" recipes, because I find them too bland or whatnot, but this really is a great and simple recipe.  I was worried about putting in too many peas and/or onions, because I wasn't really measuring, but I think next time I will put a more generous helping in.  I was also worried about it being too watery.  Nope!  I will definitely be making this one again, thanks!  EDIT: I made this again last night and am currently eating it for lunch.  You truly cannot go wrong with this recipe even if you totally screw up the portions; I barely had any onion, threw more cheese in, etc.  I think pearl onions could be a good substitution for the chopped onions...could also try different kinds of sauces...lots of ideas!",

I used chicken broth instead of water and added fresh garlic oregano Italian seasoning and fresh parsley per some of the reviews. I also doubled the cheese to use mine up. We still ended up adding crushed red pepper and garlic bread to give it more flavor. I think diced tomatoes ground sausage and basil could be good additions.",
