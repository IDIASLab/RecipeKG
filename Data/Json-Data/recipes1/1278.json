So I was a little worried but wanted to try something different.\r\n\r\n#2 I was amazed ath the amount of sugar it called for in just the batter. But it came out great nice and moist, mildy sweet and nutty. It tasted great even without the frosting. Which I recommend you let cool to get a better consistency. The frosting is rich but really good... Thanks for sharing!",

If using a tube pan with a removable bottom wrap foil around the outside of it and place pan on a rimmed cookie sheet or it could leak all over the oven! After cooking the frosting I transferred it to a pyrex bowl to speed up the cooling process but it still took a good amount of stirring to get it to frosting consistency. I found it much too sugary sweet and next time would opt for drizzling each cake slice with a little caramel sauce and garnish with some fruit for color.",
