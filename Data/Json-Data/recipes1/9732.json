                "reviewBody": "Wow Wow Wow!! Excellent homemade taste and so easy to make. The sour cream filling keeps the cake super moist and an 8 oz. container of whipped topping is plenty. I've made this 4 times and never needed more. Instead of almond extract I add 1.5 teaspoon of coconut extract. This gives the cake a light coconut essence yet not overpowering. Definitely use White Cake mix. The yellow takes away from the coconut flavor. This cake is also fantastic with Cream Cheese frosting (from this website) with coconut flakes mixed in. Definitely add about 1/2 cup toasted coconut on top for color. I've never refridgerated this for more than 1 day and it tasted fine - definitely long enough for the flavors to meld. And this tastes best served at room temperature. Let the cake sit out for about 2-3 hrs for the cake and frosting to soften and moisten back up before serving or else it can taste stiff and dry coming out of the fridge. This cake is so good and taste so homemade it rivals the famous coconut cake at my local gourmet bakery. UPDATE 12/22/06 Made this cake for a woman's lunch (my 6th cake) and had offers from three different women to buy this cake from me for the holidays. Yah it's that good.",

My husband paid 100 to ship one of these cakes for SC to Arizona for my birthday. I think this is about the same recipe. Next time I will use the cool whip & sour cream mixture as the filling between the layers and maybe poke holes in the cake while warm & pour over the sour cream & sugar combo then refridgerate it for a couple days. I also used a coconut cake mix from the store. Freeze the cakes before you slice them to frost much easier slicing. Fantastic can't wait to make it again!",

I also dyed a little of the coconut green and sprinkled it on top for \"grass\" then hid little jelly beans on top of the green coconut so they looked like little Easter eggs lying in the grass. I also sprinkled green coconut around the bottom and put jelly beans around the bottom. Just fantastic!",

Also when filling between the layers keep in mind that you can use 1/3 of the sour cream mixture I was thinking 1/4 and ended up with too much at the end as the cool whip mixture takes care of the top. I used light sour cream & light cool whip with good results I agree with a previous reviewer that white cake mix is a must. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!",

I agree that there is quite a bit of icing left but considering you usually have too little icing I'm not going to complain about that. You can always use the icing for other things like I used mine to top a chocolate cream pie once and it added a whole new dimension! I would highly recommend this cake however if you can stay away from it long enough to let it sit for 3 days before cutting you will not be sorry. The cake gets better as it ages in the fridge!
