This recipe fulfilled my hopes of being much more like a true Italian meat sauce. It was outstanding and my family loved it! Even my 2 pickiest kiddos who have flatly refused to eat spaghetti in the past gobbled it up. I doubled the recipe, seasoned the meat with some Emeril's essence, added more garlic than called for. Also added a can of tomato sauce in place of one of the cans of beef broth(3 cans beef broth, 1 can tomato sauce). This is our new spaghetti recipe; we absolutely love it! If you like a meaty sauce, you should definitely try this one.",

I used 2 cans of 14.5 oz beef broth because I couldn't find 10.5 oz cans and I also added a 15oz can of tomato sauce plus 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon of italian seasoning.  I will be making this sauce in bigger batches in the future to freeze.  I won't ever buy bottled sauce again.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

I saw this recipe and made it according to instructions (no mushrooms though) and I am in love!!!  It was great. The flavor was just right.  Not too acidic.  The kids liked it.  Hubby liked it.

I used some dried celery and only a couple of T worth canned portabella mushrooms a can of tomato puree 10oz. and added a can of chicken broth as it was too thick after only 1 hour of simmering and it was all I had. I tossed in some corkscrew and rotini pasta and cooked it in the sauce adding broth as needed since I had everything pasta-wise BUT spaghetti on hand. It made sort of a pasta goulash that way and turned out really well. My diet conscious hubby even went back for seconds! Thanks for a great supper. UPDATE: 12.01.10 I made this again using fresh celery fresh mint and the tomato paste this time. I still used the canned portabella pieces. This knocked hubby's socks off once again! I used a large box/container of beef broth and then added a can of chicken after the first hour as it was too thick. AWESOME recipe! Thanks!",
