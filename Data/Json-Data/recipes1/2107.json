Simple it most definitely is and very easy too--especially if you have a stand mixer and dough hook. I used one loaf to make Thanksgiving stuffing and the other for sandwiches and snacking. The crust as others have noted is awesome. I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and half the amount of honey instead of white sugar. What a great recipe--thanks George!",
