The worst problem was having no recipe for the salad dressing we are told to use. The test says \"recipe below\" but there was nothing and a search produces no salad dressing recipe by this author or anything even similar. Perhaps if the actual dressing was included this might have had a better rating from my taste testers.",

I thought it was a strange combination and so was delighted when this recipe came up. I had to adapt to what was on hand so here is how it went together in my kitchen although the original recipe would be even better. I changed to 4-6 ounces of fresh spinach no tomato C mushrooms coarsely chopped and 12 green olives halved sprinkled a generous amount of bacon bits on top (to please hubby) parmesan cheese and then honey mustard salad dressing. Served 4 generously. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.",
