However I found it near impossible to get the seasoning to stick to the pasta. I had to omit the dry mustard since I didn't have any on hand but I substituted a few other seasonings and it was delicious. I think I'll try to experiment with different pasta shapes and try to find a way to get the seasonings to stick. Thanks.",

I used shells which were great for eating but a bit difficult to fry. I also used grated Parmesan which had trouble sticking but the shells did a great job of catching the flavor. But the really important change was I dipped them in marinara sauce. That was fantastic! And this is a great thing to do with the large amount of pasta-based meals I find myself living off of.
