It also features other delectable delights such as Earthworm Cookies. This pie is absolutely delicious and amazing because it makes its own separate crust, filling and topping; all out of the blender! My recipe instructs to blend as you count slowly to 10, and it instructs to put the coconut in the blender with the other ingredients.  As such, it provides a nice buttery topping for the pie.  It also fools skeptics of the pie who think they don't like coconut.  This is a definite keeper in our house.  If you love custard, you'll love this pie.  Incidentally, I do not try the Earthworm Cookie recipe!",

It looked incredible & I only spent about 5 minutes on it.;o) I think my guests were more impressed w/ the ease of this recipe than anything. So if you really wanna show off...make it in front of them & let them see how it's just \"thrown\" in a blender.
