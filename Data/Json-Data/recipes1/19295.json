Next time I will use the remaining pineapple juice when making the rice and will reduce the chicken broth by that amount.  Will do this just because we really like pineapple and I think it will add to the rice.  I used boneless chicken but I think this would also be great with skin.  I hesitated about making this because the other review was SO negative but then realized the reviewer hadn't even made the recipe!",
