They have got to be THE greasiest cookies EVER and they weren't cookies... it was just one giant extremely thin cookie-like mess on the baking pan (it did taste good if you didn't mind allll the grease). They spread out far too thin - I could hardly scrape them off the cookie sheet. Would never make again. Even my husband rated them 1/5 and he is a cookie monster.:) My advice to you - keep searching for the perfect chewy cookie recipe - unfortunately this one isn't worth the time or expense. If you did want any of the cookie mess you had to eat with a spoon.",
