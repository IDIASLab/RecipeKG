My family wouldn't even eat it. That what happens when I try to be lazy and make a simple recipe such as this. It wasn't horrible it just wasn't good.

I did however have to cut my chicken down the middle to thin it out and then press it out to get the correct size. I also after rolling them up I cut them in half because the middle was really thick and I wanted to keep the cooking time down. It seemed to have helped as it cook to the exact time and was deleious. very simple to do without having to put in much thought. You do need to season the chicken to taste though as with just the cream cheese alone is not enough for a full flavor. Thank you for sharing...",
