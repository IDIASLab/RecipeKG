All I've ever seen in my life are ones dipped in an egg/milk mixture and cooked on a griddle like french toast. This recipe is good at duplicating what I've had at restaurants. You definitely can't cook them on too high a heat or the outside will burn before the sandwich is warmed all the way through. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar and a side of strawberry jam for dipping. Sounds bizarro but is excellent! Now if I only had those crisp restaurant french fries to go with it!",

There were none left for me when I got home from work!  I think the problem that people were having with them being soggy is because they were trying to cook them too quickly.  It is basically french toast.  If you cooked french toast at too high a temp it would also be browned to fast and soggy. Turn your heat down and cook them slower.  The cheese meltinf should make them stay together. This is a great treat that you can make ahead.",

I used thick egg bread like Challah or a Brioche bread that can hold the batter. I use  whole-berry cranberry sauce on the inside of the bread  ham turkey  swiss of course and a few slices of  good applewood bacon.  You can also experiment with a different chesse.... but my batter is made from 1/2 & 1/2 (1/4 cup) and eggs(4 large) to your batter add a dash of nutmeg and black pepper and cook it as if you are cooking fench toast but in a sandwich form.... Plate it with some warm maple syrup for dunking!!! I hope this info helps some1...enjoy!!!",

We have seven in our family so by the end of making these I figured out why some were soggy. I used a pie pan for the liquids and a slotted metal spatula. Build the sandwich then place in the liquid QUICKLY scoop flip and quickly remove allowing the excess to drip off. The sandwich shouldn't stay in the liquid for more than half a sec or else it gets soggy. I used sourdough bread of a regular thickness and munster cheese because my family doesn't like swiss. I didn't use mayo or mustard but powdered sugar over top and seedless raspberry jam for dipping are a MUST-yummy. I also failed to mention that I used leftover ham fro or baked hame from easter- a great way to use leftovers!",
