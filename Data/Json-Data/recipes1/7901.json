Personally, I think they are prettier left whole (especially if you are planning on serving them to guests) 2.) I had extras of almost every ingredient except the cinnamon/sugar. My suggestion would be: double the cinnamon, TRIPLE the sugar, and cut all of the rest of the ingredients in half (unless you want to make a TON!). 3.) When you roll the bread slices flat, make sure it is very smashed. Otherwise the butter soaks into the bread too much and makes it really soggy. And last... 4.) Bake them longer than it calls for (about 15 minutes).\r\n\r\nI had never had these before, but this recipe is a keeper. I think it would be great to serve at a brunch.",

We don't serve them with the sour cream, but they are always a hit.  A quick tip - the cinnamon-sugar can get a bit lumpy and tacky from the melted butter after a while. so start out with only half the butter and cinnamon-sugar in small bowls.  When you are halfway done dipping the blini, toss the old tacky stuff and start dipping the other half with fresh melted butter and cinnamon-sugar.",

If you want to avoid having a plate with cinnamon sugar paste on it sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on them instead of rolling. I had McCormick pre-mixed cinn-sugar and using that was great. I baked them for 15 minutes on parchment paper lined cookie sheets. (Parchment paper is my best friend in the kitchen). I didn't use the sour cream just served them as is and got great compliments.",

I followed some tips and added egg and sugar to the cream cheese mix and it was ok kind of a simple cheesecake mixture. I also didn't find it too messy or difficult. The thing that for me let it down the most was the white bread...I was skeptical but based on comments I was hopeful that the bread would undergo some kind of transformation which it did not...it tasted like cheesecake mix wrapped in white bread sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. And whether you like them or hate them I think to call them blintzes is extremely misleading as they are not even close to the real thing.",
