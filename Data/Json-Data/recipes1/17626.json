                "reviewBody": "This is hands down one of the best  beef stroganoff recipes I have had in a long time. I did use stew meat and just made sure to brown it good and let it rest a bit and simmered a little longer. Made recipe exactly as written but added an additional 3 Tbs. flour mixed in with some broth to tighten it up a little. The creme fraiche really seals the deal you don't have to go crazy to buy it. If you know you will make this then you can make your own. In a non reactive container mix 1cup heavy cream with 1Tbs of buttermilk or plain yogurt and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Leave out at room temp. around 72 degrees for 24 hours stir once and a while 8 hours or so but not necessary. Warming the cream a little will speed things up a little and it can be used in as little as 12 hours but will not have the consistency you may want. It can go as long as 36 hours I find 24 or so just right. Can be stored in tight container in frige for up to 10 days the cold will stop the fermentation and you Can make ahead. Also great for creamed recipes and potatoes. This recipe is a keeper for sure. I know I will be making it a part of the rotation. Serve over wide egg noodles its great. Be sure to make extra I bumped recipe to ten servings to have some leftovers for lunch you will be glad you did. Reheats well just slow simmer. Happy cooking, GG",
