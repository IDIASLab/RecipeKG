What is missing from reviews is how it held up and how to keep (refrigerate etc.) It made up beautifuly- no grit etc. but when I went the next day to ice, it fell apart. I re whipped and frosted, then in an hour or so, began to sweat. The decorations began to fall off. Became a nightmare. I think this is a good FROSTING when used immediately, but NOT for a cake you plan to decorate. I imagine it on a nice layer cake or cupcakes then served right away. A nice taste alternative in that regards. Refrigerating the cake was the only thing that saved it until the party. Just beware and try it out ahead. Live and learn!",

Perfect icing! it's so light and fluffy I can't belive it! I even used flour instead of cornstarch bec I didn't have cornstarch and figured it was being used to \"thinken\" the icing - worked like a charm!! THANKS SO MUCH! Just finished icing the rest of them which my family will have for dessert tonight!",

Also I put it in the freezer for a short time before I had to use it just to make it cold because I thought the warm milk might contribute to the 'sweating' talked about by others. After I took it out I whipped it up again to make sure it wouldn't separate then took half of it with me to work with the cinnamon rolls and left the other half in the fridge. The frosting on warm cinnamon rolls tended to melt but on room temperature rolls it was perfectly stable. Also 8 hours later when I returned home: the leftover frosting I took with me (non-refrigerated) was still in good shape but the refrigerated frosting fell apart when used.",
