The whole family absolutely loved the salmon and I will definetely cook it this way again. The only thing I will change is the rice. It is probably just a matter of what tastes you like but it was voted down in my family 2 to 1. I got three different opinions from my family. My mother liked it my son absolutely hated it and I ate it; but it wasn't that great to me. I think the orange taste is what turned my son and I off from the rice. We are rice lovers (we could eat it everyday of the week) but I will definetely skip the rice in this recipe next time.",
