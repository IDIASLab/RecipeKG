It's along the lines of something I sometimes make that has hot dogs and rice in it but is even easier than this. It was interesting to try something new but I can't say I have reason to make it again.",

Can tomato soup and packaged hot dogs are what they are so if you are expecting something more flavorful herb-y and fresh tasting then you are going to have to add it. No brainer in my book. Try having some fun with the hot dogs by making an octopus or a hot dog man to serve on top (see hot dog men recipe on this site). The kiddo's seem to always get a kick out of them.",
