The 18 egg whites surprised me a little but it was well worth it! For all those others out there who are new at angel food cakes do NOT grease the pan. I greased the bottom of mine and that was the only problem I had. Where I greased the pan the cake stuck and where I didn't it did not stick but that was my fault. Follow the recipe exactly and don't grease the pan and you will have a perfectly fluffy and moist angel food cake!",

I made a slight modification in mine: in addition to the 1 tsp vanilla I added an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla (used part artificial vanilla/part natural vanilla extract) and I added about 1/2 tsp almond extract as well. The results are great I shared it with my coworkers recently and now am making it for the 2nd time just this week per request! Our oldest employee at age 79 says it's the best she has ever had:) I serve this with sliced strawberries and homemade whipped cream but it is so good that it's just as delicious by itself.",

For those of you who've never made angel food take the previous advice about not greasing the pan. Also I did not add the flour all at once. I added it in fourths and folded it in by doing 2 deep folds with a spatula then turning the bowl a quarter turn. When you take it out of the oven you should invert it until it's totally cool.
