Also I would recommend after baking the first layer to trim the top off so that the cake remains even because once you pour the caramel on it tends to pool at the edges. Next time I will definitely do that!",

This is not a cake to serve hot.  It tastes better cooled and then the filling is solidified.  A great cake to make the evening before you serve it.  My kids love to help unwrap the caramels...of course a few never make it to the cake, but that doesn't matter.  Enjoy!!",

It will help keep the first cake layer from forming a raised center...as one other review pointed out if the cake is raised in the center the caramel pools into the corners and edges leaving the center without much of the good stuff. I also used only 1/4 c. butter in the caramel mixture in fact I wonder if the 3/4 c. is a typo. There's just no reason for that much butter. I also substituted 1/2 c. milk instead of the 2/3 c. evaporated milk. The caramel mixture seemed alarmingly thin when I first spread it on the cake but it worked out just fine. Next time I'll try baking it just a little longer for the second cake layer. It is hard to tell when it's done and I don't think 20 minutes was enough. Regardless it was a HUGE it at my most recent family gathering! I'm going to make it again this weekend.",

I'm not a fan of sweets so I scoured this site high and low looking for a recipe that we could both enjoy. Since we both like the turles candies I thought this would be great to try. Boy was it heavenly! And since I don't bake much this was really easy. Even my daughter (5yrs old) helped me! My boyfriend topped it off with ice cream...very good and deserves 5 stars. It was esspecially tasty after having lemon mushroom herb chicken also found on this site...first sour followed by sweet! The only thing it was hard to tell when it was done baking because of the carmel (as others have stated) but still very good! Thanks Debbie...my boyfriend sends his compliments!",
