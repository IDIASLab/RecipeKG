I made lots of changes the main one being that I realized I was out of oatmeal and so I chopped up some hotdogs and added them to the dough. Also I think the liquid is off in this recipe...I ended up adding a little milk to make the dough come together. Didn't add the sugar on top as our dogs are kind of chunky and don't need the extra calories LOL!",
