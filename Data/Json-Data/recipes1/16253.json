If Gruyere is not available, swiss might work as a substitute, but the flavor that you get from the Gruyere is awesome.  Also, would recommend not skimping on the onions, they\u2019re an important part of making this distinct.   Fortunately, I had set aside some of the pasta water because the cheese sauce was very thick and starting to get stringy, so I used quite a bit to get the sauce to the right consistency.  We love mac and cheese, and this is a special one!",
