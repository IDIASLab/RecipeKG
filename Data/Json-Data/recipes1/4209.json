I normally reduce sugar in all of my recipes, especially baking, so take that in consideration! \r\n\r\nA whole lot of subs on this one; I made my own baking mix for the 1/2 cup of bisquick called for : 6 and 1/2 TBSP Flour, 5/8 tsp Baking Powder, 1/4 teas Salt and 1 TBSP shortning. I combined all of this in my mini food processor and combined until it resmembled corse meal.  The other sub I haven't seen anyone mention w/ the buttermilk is Buttermilk powder I use for baking.  (saves on fat and lactose!) the packaging for the buttermilk powder says to add powder when combining dry ingrediants and then when it asks for liquid buttermilk add that amount of water.  (For 1 cup of buttermilk that breaks down to 4 TBSP buttermilk powder and 1 cup of water) I added the buttermilk powder with the sugar and baking mix and fully combined before adding the liquids.  \r\n\r\nThe last little bit of change I had to do; after the thirty minutes the pie was still soup so I kept it in for another twenty minutes until it was golden brown and somewhat solid.  Next time I may use a little bit more of the baking mix. \r\n\r\nTURNED OUT LOVELY - this is going to be a staple in our household!!",
