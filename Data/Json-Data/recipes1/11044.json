I spray the pan with cooking spray and turn the chops after 10 min.  They come out brown on the outside and juicy in the inside. I hope this information is helpful. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

With this in mind (and always thinking of the fat and calories!) I used just 1/2 cup of melted margarine mixed with 3/4 cup of buttermilk. The chops were just wonderful. I did have some coating left but only about a cup so I think the buttermilk makes the coating stick better. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. The chops were very moist and very tasty. I would not hesitate to seve this to guests. Thanks Marilyn for sharing this Great recipe.",

I had a package of 6 pretty thin boneless pork chops and decided that 3 cups of saltines and two cups of cheese was way too much! I crushed up one package of crackers and used about a half cup of parmesan cheese. This still ended up to be too much but not by much. I'm always trying to reduce the fat and calories in my meals so I used a half cup of margarine instead of one of butter. I also found that after dipping the chops and coating them in the cracker mixture that pushing the mix into the chops really helped to make it stick well. I have a gas stove that I'm still learning about (we just moved in) and it took 19 minutes at 400 degrees for them to cook through. I flipped them at ten minutes (as per another reviewer) and they were moist and very flavorful--not dry at all! My husband and I were very happy...Superb!",

I also took another suggestion from another reviewer and used a 1/2 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of buttermilk.  I also seasoned my porkchops with a little accent, unseasoned meat tenderizer, pepper and a little seasoned salt and let it sit for an hour before I started the recipe.  I made 7 pork chops.  Oh My!

I always line my baking pan with some of the breading, mostly the crackers, and then sprinkle more over the top.  That helps make the chops crispier, but I have never even come close to using all the breading mixture. I only use enough butter to coat the chops once, more than that and it gets soggy.",
