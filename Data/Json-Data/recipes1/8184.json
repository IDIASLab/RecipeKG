First of all I omitted the maple syrup and the 5 spice powder. I added 2 minced garlic cloves and 2 TBS of honey. I cut the chicken into long strips about an inch wide. I did everything else the same except I fried the floured chicken in batches and added a little water at the end of each batch to scrape up the browned bits on the pan and then adding a little more oil before each batch. After the last batch was cooked I poured the remaining marinade in the pan with about 1\\2 cup of water and reduced it. Then I poured it over the cooked chicken and sprinkled the sesame seeds on top. It may not taste like a restaurant made it but with these changes it becomes very edible.",

The sauce ingredients don't make up enough to marinate and recoat the chicken plus when you boil the sauce it crystalizes and hardens. Instead I had to marinate then discard original sauce. Then I mixed together another dose of sauce and coated after chicken was cooked. Also I don't think 1/2 teaspoon peanut oil is correct I used quiet a bit more to keep my chicken from burning. Before I make this recipe again I think I'll look for a better glaze style sauce to dip in after the chicken is cooked.",
