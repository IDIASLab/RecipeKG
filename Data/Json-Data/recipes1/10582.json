I roasted two chickens on the grill til almost done then basted the chickens for the last 10 minutes of grilling. The skin was crispy and the basting sauce was so good. Thanks Ron for a very easy sauce that is delicious. There were no leftovers! I added 1 Tablespoon of sugar to give the glaze \"sticking power\" and may add fresh garlic the next time I try it. Very good and easy and very big flavor impact!",
