However the major flavor is the molasses. I followed the recipe exactly and was a little worried about the amount of molasses but I read all the shining reviews I thought I would take a chance. Sorry but this bread should maybe be named \"Molasses Oatmeal\" bread. In other words molasses bread made with oatmeal. Sorry!",

I mixed it for four minutes on medium low instead of hand kneading. Left the ingredients in tact, as I always do when making a recipe for the first time. I did, however, do a third rising as I usually do with most breads.\n\nBut my second batch! WOW! Wanted to experiment, so I added half a cup of raisins, 1/2 cup light brown sugar, and a tablespoon of cinnamon. Best cinnamon raisin bread I have made. Sprinkled some oats and sugar on top as well for presentation (and the sugar makes a nice crispness on top.)\n\nThank you! Excellent bread recipe.",

I followed the recipe exactly except for using reduced fat milk and quick cooking oats and that made no difference at all. The dough was very sticky so I think that it wouldn't hurt if you added extra oatmeal. I also want to try it with the addition of eggs as well as well as adding ginger and cinnamon. I even had the idea that it would be good if I used orange or apple juice in place of the water with the sugar omiited. Granted I haven't tried any of these variations yet but I can't wait to!:D",
