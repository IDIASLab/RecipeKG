It was light, not dense, but that could be because I mixed it in my KitchenAid and then kneaded the bread by hand.  I let the loaves rise on a sheet of parchament paper on the wood paddle that came with my pizza stone.  Then I transfered paper and loaves to the stone, which made it extremely easy.  I baked it for the lesser time and gave it an additional 5 minutes just before serving and the bread was heavenly.  The aroma, texture and presentation was top-notch.  The recipe calls for preheating your oven just after the first knead, but I think there was an error in the directions.  You don't have to heat your oven until the second rising begins with your stone in the oven.  I'll make this again and again!",

I'll let you know once it's done baking how it came out. But I don't think it's going to be so good. I'm going to stick w/the Artisan Bread in 6 minutes a day (i think that's what it's called.
