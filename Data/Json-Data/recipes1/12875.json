I lightly seasoned both sides of the fillets with Lawry's salt.  Instead of raspberry vinegar, I used a raspberry vinaigrette, which isn't so \"vinegary,\" for lack of a better word, but still flavorful.  I also used 2 Tblsp Dijon mustard instead of yellow, and cut the olive oil in half.  I didn't have any dill, so I used rosemary.  I also used just a bit less than 1/4 C of honey b/c the vinaigrette is already sweetened.  The result was fantasic!!!!  Even my very picky kids liked it!!!",

Also I only had extra virgin olive oil in the house (it overpowered the flavors). I would also cut the amount of oil n half. You don't need all of the oil. It is a little on the sweet side but not bad a little more mustard would help. Changing to Dijon or brown mustard would add the tang I am looking for. It is so easy I will try this recipe again tasting the sauce as I go along to get the right mix. Always try the original once before making any changes.",
