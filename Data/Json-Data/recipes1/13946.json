Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed by the recipe. I'm blaming it all on the soda. I used Sierra Mist, but I doubt Sprite or 7 Up would have created a better result. The whole cake had this weird chemical taste ... ugh, like I said, nasty. My advice is to modify \"Lisa's Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cake\" recipe using lemon cake mix and pudding mix, omitting the chocolate chips and adding a couple tablespoons of lemon juice. I did this the day after making this disgusting cake (because I was REALLY craving lemon cake) and it turned out simply delicious.  No chemical weirdness, MUCH moister than this cake because that recipe uses sour cream, basically, just a million, trillion times better. I don't know how ya'll loved this so much, but i STRONGLY recommend using that other recipe instead!",

I added some poppy seeds (personal preference to lemon cakes)but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. When I tested for doness at 35min. The cake FELL. Completely flattened! Thats the first time EVER that has happened to me. So at 35 min. the cake was not done but very brown. I baked another 20 minutes for doneness. Please note that the bake time is 325 but I did a 350 oven for almost an hour. Also this has an artificial lemon taste and has NO tangy Zip taste of lemons. Needs real lemon juice instead of the carbonated drink that I believe is leaving a bad tingly after taste in my mouth. Sorry but thumbs down to everything about this recipe.",

Don't use mountain dew- I just tried that and it changed the taste dramatically as well as the texture and color. Dew has more sugar and caffine so I found sprite or 7 up is best. I always top it with a cream cheese icing- Blend 4T fresh lemon juice, 4 oz cream cheese, and 2 cups powdered sugar until smooth- drizzle all over cooled cake. Add thinly sliced lemons around the edges on your cake plate and voila! Beautiful.",
