I used a can of tomatoes/chiles as suggested by another cook, and added some hot sauce and chili powder to the meat mixture.  I also added 1/2 can of corn to the meat.  For the topping, I used a box of Jiffy corn muffin mix, prepared according to the directions on the box, and added the other 1/2 can of corn to this.  I sprinkled some extra cheese on top, and baked.  The sweetness of the cornbread topping really complemented the slightly spicy meat, and my whole family loved it.  It was a winner!",
