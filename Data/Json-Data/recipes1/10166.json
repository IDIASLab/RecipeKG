I used 2 pounds of calamari instead of one partly because the bell peppers I used were huge. I omitted the jalapeno pepper but the next time I make this I may substitute a milder pepper perhaps an anaheim. I was not sure how big a bunch is--for the cilantro and parsley--so I used about three quarters cup of torn cilantro leaves and omitted the parsley. Another reviewer mentioned that this does need some salt But I like to leave that to the individual.",
