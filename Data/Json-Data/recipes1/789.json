You really do have to chill the dough and the trays and work fast. I used powdered sugar instead of flour to prevent sticking and I really think it worked well and added a little extra to the flavour. Thanks Galia for sharing this fun easy recipe. My little one had a ball using the cookie cutters and decorating then.",

I only had large granule white sugar and dark brown sugar so I used them instead of normal sugar and light brown. The cookies that were baked for only 10 minutes had a gummy/cardboardy texture and the ones that baked for longer were crispy to the point of being too crispy. They were however good in milk. I added a little ground ginger and cinnamon to half the dough and enjoyed the flavor more than without the extra spices. If I get around to baking again with fine white sugar and light brown sugar I will post results and compare the two batches.",

The dough rolls out very very easily and is somewhat fragile. If you need to decorate your cutout shapes before baking them it is a good idea to chill the cookie sheet with the unbaked cookies on it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes or so before proceeding. It is also a good idea to chill the sheet with the unbaked cookies on it before placing it into your preheated oven. This recipe reminds me of a recipe I lost nearly 40 years ago. Thanks Galia!!!",
