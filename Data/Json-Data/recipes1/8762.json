I used a pre-made frozen pound cake that I cut into squares when thawed. Next I had custard powder in the house from a different recipe so I made that instead of the pastry cream that this recipe calls for. I know lots of changes but the 4 stars I give this recipe is what I rate it when I make it according to the original directions. The changes I made this last time are just optional suggestions to save time and change it up!",

Unlike every other English trifle recipe here it uses real pastry cream instead of a mix and does not substitute whipped topping for real whipped cream. A real trifle to me is sponge cake custard jam sherry and whipped cream. It is not a collection of processed foods. You can really taste the difference especially with the taste of the custard.",
