I wasn't sure it was done because the middle looked wet and shiny but it wasn't sticky so I removed it from the steamer. This is rich, moist, dense and sweet. The corn meal gives a nice texture. I did not think it would come out of my bowl even though I greased it, but I tried turning over on a tray and it came out nicely. This is a little sweeter than I was hoping but absolutely delish.",
