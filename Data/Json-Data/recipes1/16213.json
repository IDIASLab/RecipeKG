I made it exactly as written except left out the jalapeno to appease to the more delicate taste buds of a toddler and I also tossed in a can of kidney beans. I also used fresh garlic (5 cloves) left it in the crock pot for 8 hours on low (smelled sinfully good) and served w/ green onion cilantro and sour cream. Hubbie says \"Good but no Sazon Goya next time\" as he spent the afternoon Googling MSG which is the #1 ingredient in those wee envelopes. I was just happy to make a Chili that didn't have a generic \"Chili Flavor Packet\" dumped into it. So /deep breath/ -- to sum up -- this is a simple and yes simply sensational chili that tastes like chili and isn't dominated by any one ingredient or spice. Just.Good.Chili.",
