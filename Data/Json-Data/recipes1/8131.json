I used chunky peanut butter and for a richer pie I used cold evaporated milk. Right before I stuck it in the fridge I sprinkled chopped Reese's PB cups over the top. Very easy and used pantry/fridge ingredients I had on hand. We're on a tight budget for a bit so I've got to use what I've got--this fit the bill. I'll update my review once we've had it for dessert. NOTE: This was good but with my changes it was better. I don't think it would have been half as good had I not made my own cookie crust and added chopped Reese's on the top.",

I LOVE chocolate and peanut butter (Reese's PB cups are one of my favorite candies) but for some reason I didn't care for the combo here. The PB taste was overpowering IMHO. Reducing it might help but I don't think I'll be reattempting this again to find out. As with any new recipe I try I made a couple of changes. My biggest change was substituting a chocolate cookie crust for the graham cracker one called for (it seemed to be a more suitable match for the filling ingredients...). My other change was out of necessity. I substituted evaporated milk for regular milk because I didn't have the latter on hand. NOTE: My pie set up really well but I did let it sit in the fridge overnight. Serving individual slices with a dollop of Cool-Whip and cut up PB cups made for a nice presentation. Thanks for sharing your idea BUCHKO!:)",
