                "reviewBody": "As hubs put it bread is generally neutral in flavor and that's good and the way it should be. And when bread IS flavored with something it's often overpowering. When he eats bread he says he wants bread not a mouthful of herbs for instance. With this bread however the combination of flavors is subtle and pleasant. It's hard to describe what it tastes like because all of the seasonings are so well blended. I do detect the chili powder and a hint of the beer and even though I did not use the chile oil and only half the amount of cayenne pepper called for we still could detect the \"bite.\" I know neither of us would have cared for this had I used both and in the amounts called for because we wouldn't like \"hot and spicy\" bread! Just to make things simple I used the 3:1 ratio of flour and liquid so I used a cup of beer and three cups of flour then upped the rest of the ingredients just slightly to compensate. I will be serving this with \"White Chili with Chicken \" also from this site. (Hubs generally resists any kind of flavored bread and he really liked this one!)",

I made the following changes and was able to make it without a bread baker.  I used 2.5 tsp of dry active yeast which I proofed in 2 oz of warm water - 110 degrees (I just run my faucet at the hottest for a minute to get the right temperature)for about 6 minutes until the yeast blooms.  I then weigh my flour (9.55 oz).  I add all the spices although I reduced the onion to 1/2 T, 5 oz of beer and 2 T of regular olive oil.  I knead it in my mixer using the dough hook for 6 min.  I let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour, I then roll it out to 8.5 by 5 inch rectangle and roll it up from the long side, put in 8.5 by 4 inh loaf pan, let it rise another hour and then bake at 400 for 30 minutes",
