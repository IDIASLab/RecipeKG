After reading the reviews stating the bread was a little dry and the PB flavor wasn't very pronounced, I made some modifications - with great results! Reduce the flour to 1 and 3/4 cups and increase the peanut butter to 3/4 cup. Cover the bread with foil after an hour or it will get very dark. I omitted the walnuts because I felt they would compete with the PB flavor and added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips which really pulled the flavors together beautifully. Raisins would be great too though. The bread requires at least 1 hour and 20 minutes to bake. This is very filling and delicious! Thanks!",

Everyone at work loved them.  :)  The remaining batter I did in a loaf pan - but it did take a long time to cook all the way through - but when it was done, it was tasty too.  :)  Give some variation of this recipe a try!",

Per the suggestion from some other reviewers, I used 3 large over-ripe bananas and increased my peanut butter to 3/4 cup.  I took the flour down to 1 3/4 cups, and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  My own little ideas were to add 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar to the white sugar (still keeping white sugar amount the same), and also adding 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce to the butter mixture (without taking down the amount of butter).  I don't know if these changes are why my muffins are so much more moist than many reviewers said theirs were, but whatever I did worked!!!  I also added a teaspoon of imitation banana extract, as some people thought the peanut butter overpowered the banana flavor.  Also, I left out the walnuts, since I was making them for children and didn't know if they'd like the nuts.  I baked them as muffins for 25 minutes and they turned out absolutely perfect!!!  After doubling this recipe I ended up with exactly 41 large muffins, so not quite two dozen if the recipe had been made exactly as written (unless you wanted to make small muffins).  I would recommend this recipe to anyone, using the modifications I suggested.  Thanks!!!!!",

The drawbacks are that it does brown way too fast(the foil remedy worked for that). I didn't bake it for as long as it said because when I checked it with a toothpick it came out clean and I was afraid of letting it get too dry. When it was cool and I cut it there was a big hole in the middle where it had undercooked. The problem is that if I had finished baking it the bread would have been dry. As it was everything around the whole was baked perfectly.",

Oh and I added 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips to half the batter. I made 24 muffins. 3 grams of fiber per muffin.
