I read most of the reviews and everyone seemed to say it was lacking something or it was too tangy. I had cooked chicken breasts that had been seasoned with Ms. Dash and I used those. I just started the recipe at the sauce and added the chicken to it until heated through. I tasted the sauce and I did end up adding some brown sugar (2 tbsp) as others did. I doubled the ginger added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and 1/4 tsp crushed rosemary. BINGO! Very yummy. I served this with green beans and red skin mashed potatoes. I loved dipping my taters in the sauce. I will make this again!",
