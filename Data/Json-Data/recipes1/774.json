These cookies are light and crispy but ungodly sweet because of the butterscotch chips - right up his alley! He liked these sooo much that they've even taken over his first place Oatmeal Scotchies which have been his favorite for at least 20 years. Reducing the sugar in the recipe as some reviewers have done is NOT going to make these less sweet but might in fact change the quality of the dough which is perfect. I personally couldn't stand these but then I don't care for butterscotch chips - but I will look forward to making this same cookie with semi-sweet chocolate chips because I think they'll be awesome good! In the meantime Hubs has had four of these immediately after supper which he never does...",
