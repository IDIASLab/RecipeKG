I did add 2 T of corn meal (I didn't have corn flour) and meant to add cinnamon but forgot so we added it on top. I also used unsweetened vanilla almond milk because that is what I had. I served them with pure maple syrup. YUM! Our waffle maker is divided into four small waffles. It made 7 small squares. We even had 3 left over and I ate one plain just out of the waffle iron. YUM again. Thanks for the recipe!",
