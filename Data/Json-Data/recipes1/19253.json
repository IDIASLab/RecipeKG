The only thing I do different, and it works well, when I grate my cucumber I use 4 layers of papper towel and absorb the moisture out of the cucumber in this way.  The mint and real greek yoghurt is what makes this recipe!!  We are such big fans at home, we use it on everything.  I make a fresh batch every week, and sometimes 2.

The next batch was out of this world good!!! The trick is to really, really dry the cucumber and add the lemon and salt a little at a time to your likening. Thanks Chef John great job!
