I've used Ina's baked risotto in the past but came across Chef John's yesterday and decided to give it a try. I made a few modifications based on what I had in the house...broccoli instead of mushrooms and added a bit of chopped garlic and white wine. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely perfect. Loved being able to stick in the oven for 15 minutes and walk away. Awesome recipe. Thanks Chef John!",
