Adding any array of your favourite veggies just makes it that much better - 5 stars! Edit - I have now made this a bunch of times and I found doing boneless skinless chicken breasts pieces in place of the meatballs is the winner!",

I did have some trouble with the consistency of the meat after i added the bread egg and seasonings. It was just too moist and I thought it would fall apart when put in the sauce. I think that was my fault though as I don't know if I had the full amount of chicken that the recipe called for and it had been in the freezer and was a little watery. But I fixed that problem by adding some breadcrums and putting the meatballs in the oven set at a very low temp for a little while and let them dry out and firm up and they turned out wonderful. I didn't have any garlic powder so I used Mrs. Dash's garlic seasoning. I don't know if this made much difference but I thought the meatballs were perfectly seasoned. Also next time I make this (and there will be a next time!!) I think I will cut down on the vinegar a bit - a little to vinegary for my taste. I had to add some more brown sugar to balance it out. But all in all a very tasty dish!!",

For one the recipe calls for \"instant rice\" to be used but doesn't really specify. Most packages labeled \"instant rice\" actually take more than five minutes to cook (as the recipe suggests) - what it should call for is Minute rice - which cooks faster. Also the meatballs did not hold together very well. Next time I think I'll skip the milk the just add the bread into the mixture on its own. And suggest not chopping the fruits and vegetables so small. I at least like it better with bigger chunks of onion pepper and pineapple - it seems to be more flavorful.",
