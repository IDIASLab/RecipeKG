The dressing really isn't supposed to become creamy so to speak but \"emulsified\". In order to achieve this you must DRIZZLE the oil into your food processor or blender very very slowly. If a creamy consistancy is what you prefer there are other recipes on this site that call for mayo. Thanks Michelle!",
