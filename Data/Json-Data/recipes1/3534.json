For a little more flavor I added more vegetables (little more celery REALLY BIG onion some chopped turnip) and more spices (fresh parsley couple bay leaves poultry seasoning fresh ground pepper little sea salt). I wanted to make this into a rich chicken-ish noodle soup instead of potato soup so I nixed the potatoes made my own handcut noodles (I used the steps from Great Aunt Nina's Noodles and Chicken recipe which is also from this site) and cooked them in the broth of the soup after the removing bones step. This turned out a really flavorful soup that was comforting and filling. Cornish hens are almost always inexpensive and turn out some of the best dishes--this soup was no exception. I'll use this recipe again.",

But alas do not let it fool you. This was perfect. The best homeade chicken/hen soup I've ever had. I did use more than dbl the broth to make it real juicy. Also used Egg Noodles and it was WONDERFUL. I spiced it up with salt pepper some greek seasonings and a little bit of garlic powder. Very very good. Thank you!",

I just halved the hen and browned. BEWARE - those little hens take a long time to defrost - 3 days for a little hen! This would be easy to expand with more broth and more vegetables. An ideal cheap winter meal as written. Thanks for a great recipe Danielle!",

She and her husband were so grateful to get a pot of steaming soup and rustic bread to eat before the news travelled and others brought the usual \"funeral food\" for the family that would gather in. My husband and I LOVED it and I am making more this week to freeze in one portion amounts for him to take to work. Our only changes were to add some of our homegrown fresh herbs (parsley sage rosemary....the thyme was already gone for the season:-) ) during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Also our broth was the expensive kind from the natural foods store but it lacked salt so we added what we thought it needed. I think the quality of broth really made the soup rich and tasty and it was worth the expense! The hens were so easy to handle...why hadn't we thought of that! Thanks for a great recipe that we will make over and over I'm sure!",
