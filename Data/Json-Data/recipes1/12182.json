All you do is add a small package of instant vanilla pudding, 1 cup of milk, and 1 tsp vanilla to the 8 oz cool whip.  You combine the pudding mix with milk and vanilla, and mix until smooth.  Gently fold in cool whip until no streaks.  This topping is also good for a fruit dip.  It's a little more firm than just plain cool whip.  I was concerned about letting the cake sit out all day with a cool whip topping, but that wasn't a problem. Everyone was able to see how festive it was -- then chowed down on it later.  I will fix this every July 4th -- now a tradition in our family.\n",

Because my strawberries were so big I needed to slice the strawberries thinner (in half and then in thirds) to be able to make 6 red stripes. If you have to slice the strawberries more than just in half it helps to slice off some of the inside flesh. This helps the strawberries to lie flat so that only the outer red skin shows hiding the paler fleshy part. Nothing terribly unique about the taste but still yummy enough and very patriotic. Kids loved it and can help in the decorating process.",
