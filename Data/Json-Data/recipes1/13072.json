Wished it had a thicking affect to the relish at the end of the cooking process like some corn relish recipes have where the juices gel some but it didn't but it was still tasty. My littliest niece who's 2 she devoured a small ramekin all to herself. I was very pleased. It did have a nice flavor. I doubled the batch and it gave me 4 1/2 jars. I could totally see me pulsing each jar after opening them and topping like a relish on top of hot dogs. Thank you.",
