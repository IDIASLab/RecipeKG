I made 1/2 recipe. I found that 1 orange had 2 oz of juice so I just added 3/4 of a peeled orange. My blender can liquify the fiber. I had no orange juice. I had non-fat greek yogurt so to make it more vanilla I added a splash of vanilla extract and agave syrup. I think the sweeter Yoplait would have been a better choice though. I thought it tasted too room temperature so I added 4 ice cubes which helped some. I thought this tasted kind of like a smoothie version of peaches and cream oatmeal. I felt like it needed something else but I wasn't sure maybe cinnamon? I am glad it was more like a meal smoothie though because 1/2 the recipe came out to be 325 calories when I calculated it. Not a repeat smoothie but worked fine this morning.",
