I did tweak the recipe a little though based on previous reviews I took their advice to come up with something relatively similar. Instead of the ingredients listed above I used 3 Granny Smith Apples cup of all purpose flour cup white sugar cup rolled oats cup brown sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 egg 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of melted butter. Like the recipe says I first mixed together the flour white sugar egg and baking powder; only I found the mixture to be a little too dry so I added some water. Then I sliced the apples (I left the skin on and you couldn t even tell they were there) and mixed them with 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. After that I greased an 8x8 pan and spread the apples evenly around the pan. After the apples were in place I spread the cornmeal mixture on the apples and then topped it with a mixture of 1 teaspoon of cinnamon the brown sugar and rolled oats. Finally I topped the whole thing with the melted butter. The pie tasted DELICIOUS!! And it was indeed low-fat. I think I may have used slightly too much cinnamon but other than that it was GREAT! Thanks for the recipe it was so easy!! I will definitely make it again!!",

I even left the skin on the apples for more nutrients and fiber.  Next time I may use all 8 large apples, use a 9 x 13 pan and increase the topping by at least 1 1/2.  A KEEPER!",

It all fit nicely in a 9x9 square baking pan (it was of medium thickness-- not too thick). I left the peels on the apples as suggested by another reviewer. The only other changes I would make next time are to use brown sugar instead of white for the topping b/c I think it would be even more attractive. I would also not hesitate to mix the flour mixture into the apples rather than just spread it on the very top. My husband helped me to make the flour mixture & had accidentally mixed some of it into the apples before he re-read the directions. We served the apple crisp with Blue Bunny's cinnamon ice cream (a limited flavor for the fall/winter) to accent the spice in the crisp. The combination was marvelous & was not too sweet at all! Leftovers tasted even better the next day after being warmed in the microwave. Thanks so much for a great recipe!",
