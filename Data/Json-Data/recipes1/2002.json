More so than I would've expected from the recipe (a good thing). Unfortunately the blackberries seemed to be lost amongst the spices. Don't know if not having raisins did that but I would think the raisins would compound the berry-loss even more. Definately worth trying again. Next time I'll cut the spices (at the very least the nutmeg and clove) in half and see what happens. And the part in the description about being taken from Mam's handwritten recipe collection made my eyes moist. I've got a collection of cards from my grandmother who died a couple of years ago. Sometimes I love pulling them out and making what she made when I was a kid.",

I also made the \"fake\" buttermilk by adding 2 T. lemon jce. to 2 cups milk & letting it sit for 10 min. I chose to use the entire amts. of cinnamon nutmeg & cloves but it is VERY strong-flavored! Personally I love it. But it might not be a bad idea to decrease the spices to 3/4 t. or maybe even 1/2 tsp. if you don't care for the strong flavor. It does overwhelm the blackberry and leaves a clovey taste in your mouth.:)",

I halved the amount of sugar the recipe called for and made up for that in apple sauce. It still came out very moist as others have said and I thought good. But I'd say if you're going to do this still use a bit more than half the sugar. It could have been a bit sweeter. It was very soft and I ended up just mixing a little honey and warm water to brush over the top of it and then popping it back in the oven for a few minutes to let the crust get a little crunchy. This worked well. It was a very pretty cake. I think I'd recommend doing it in a loaf pan rather than cake pan though I feel like that would go with the softness better.",
