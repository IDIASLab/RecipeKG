Also used Chicken of the Sea lump crab meat and added 2 cans. Didnt have any party pump, so did it on party rye.  Made a few to taste, as I am taking them to a party...so I have 2 cookie sheets made up, so all I have to do is broil them when I get there!!!!!  I wish I would have made the mixture this morning as I think the flavors would have mixed together a little more, but all in all these are really easy and good!!! Thanks Janet and Linda!!!",

Maybe it was because there were no photos to show us what we were in for, and I'm happy to give it its first.  More likely it was because of the lackluster (read boring) name for these.  \"Janet's Appetizer? \"  This is a disservice to Janet!  Also, in my opinion the crab is what makes these!  It should NOT be optional, and the word \"crab\" should be part of the title.  I could easily see this baked and served warm  as a dip or spread, but I served this broiled on crostini and loved it.  As for preparation, one cup of minced onion was way overload for me.  I took that down to 2 T. and was quite pleased with that.  My suggestion is to start off with a lesser amount of onion and add more to taste.  I used a good, 4-year aged  cheddar and pasteurized crab meat.  I took one taste of this, cold, and it was very good.  Heated, it was remarkable.   It didn't look like it though.  It had a boring, pasty look to it, but some fresh minced red and bell peppers fixed that right up.  CELANE47, this is indeed delectable as your description states, but you MUST see if the recipe can be modified to include the crab in the dip as a mandatory part of the ingredients and come up with a better title.  I suspect this will not be given the attention it deserves  and will continue to be ignored (6 reviews in 11 years?) if the recipe continues as it stands.   Meantime, hopefully this review and my photo will help change that.",
