First according to the recipe: I like the crust, but there was a little too much of it for my taste, and I liked the filling which there was a little to little of it. I thought the apples being crunchy detracted from the overall flavor. So, the second time I cut the crust by 1/3, upped the filling by another 1/2, and precooked my apples in the cinnamon sugar in the microwave for 3 minutes. Then I arranged the apples in a circular pattern covering the entire top of the torte. While warm from the oven, I covered the top evenly with a cinnamon sugar sauce. Wow! What flavor, and the presentation was beautiful. The ladies at my Bunco party thought I had ordered it from their favorite bakery! Thanks for creating the roadmap that helped me reach my destination....AND keep up my reputation as the best cook in the group! ;)",

It came out looking like I had spent a gazillion dollars on it at some fancy bakery -- well, until I tried to cut through the crunchy apples!!!! I WISH I had seen the review that suggested to cook them first, because they DEFINITELY need it!!! Also, I think two medium/largish apples would be plenty. Six is WAY too many apples -- and I only used 4 biggish ones, and that was too many. I will definitely try this again, but I think I might try it with my home canned peaches, or maybe pears, next time. It was absolutely delicious -- just very hard to cut because of the apples. If I do the apples again, I know a lot more about how I would do it this time! The bottom crust and the cream cheese part was to die for!!!!! (***UPDATE*** I made this a second time with pears -- two cans canned pear halves, I sliced them -- and it was WAAAAAAAAAAAY better than with apples! I've revised my version of the recipe to be PEAR Bavarian Torte. Try the pears, you'll be delighted!!!)",

When it came out of the oven I couldn't resist topping it off with a warm caramel sauce - just a little. I must say the smell from the oven was definitely an indication of how it was going to taste.

I also slightly cooked the apples in the microwave for 2 min or so before I mixed them with cinnamon and sugar. Lastly after the torte cooled I used a glaze of strained nectarine jam heated and mixed with a tsp of water to give it a nice glossy finish.",

I checked out the description of a torte vs a tart and it seems to be a TART (A tart is a pastry dish usually sweet similar to a pie but different in that the top is open and not covered with pastry.) I followed the directions to the T except for the crust and I did not add vanilla. I cut my butter into the flour and sugar and did not want to mix in liquid so added a sprinkle of cinnamon then patted into the bottom of the spring form....i then put the cheese filling on top of that and I thought the recipe said 4 cups of apples for some reason so that is what i used. I sliced them in about 1/4\" slices and arranged them on edge sticking them down into the cheese mixture making a circle and then filling in the middle. Baked according to instructions. I then removed from oven and put about a 1/4 cup of peach preserves on the top and then the slivered almonds and put it under the broiler for a few minutes...(watch carefully) It was beautiful and delicious! I even think you could cut back on the sugars somewhat. Divine! just divine and very impressive! thanks for sharing this recipe! Yes I am a food critic! and still able to impress my friends thanks the these kinds of recipes!",

We did not have the almonds, and so I decided on a cinnamon sugar sauce.  YUM!  Got rave reviews from everyone, and they were fighting over who got the last of it.  This would be impressive enough for guests.  Next time I may glaze it with my Cabernet Sauvignon jelly and use pears, instead of apples.  Thank you, Terri, for a wonderful recipe.
