I sauteed some minced garlic with the onion & I didn't have bell pepper so I chopped up some fresh spinach instead. I put it in with the onions & garlic until it was slighlty wilted. My husband & I don't care for the taste of nutmeg so I omitted it & added a seasoning blend of red pepper dried onion basil...etc. I normally would have used the swiss cheese but I was also out of it so I substituted fresh grated parmesan instead. I also suggest shredding the cooked chicken rather than chopping it it makes for a nice texture. The end result was delish!",
