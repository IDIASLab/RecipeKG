Watch the sugar mixture carefully, because mine reached the soft ball stage after just 3-4 minutes at medium-low (I turned the flame down because I was using a small 2qt pot).  If you're not sure how to tell when it's done, check out www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/candy/sugar-stages.html.  It has short videos of the different candy making stages and has been a lifesaver for me.  These nuts are so crispy and delicious -- I'll bet pecans would be terrific too!",

If you don't boil the syrup enough, the nuts come out cloudy and the sugar forms crystals that are kind of powdery but they still taste good.  Try using pecans and substituting a 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom or Chinese five spice powder instead of 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon.  Also, I dump the nuts out on a SILPAT or on parchment paper to \"dry\".  Last time I made them I must have not boiled the syrup enough, and I didn't think they were ever going to set, but I left them out on the parchment paper overnight, and they turned out perfectly.

I do want to warn some people that try to make this though.  The first time I tried it my candy thermometer DID NOT read \"soft ball\" stage so I continued to cook it.  It suddenly became so hard I couldn't even stir it.  The second time around, I set the timer for 8 minutes exactly, per directions, and it did the same thing.  The third time I cooked it I set a bowl of very cold water next to the pan and kept testing it until it reached the \"soft ball\" stage and it ended up perfect...only ending up cooking it about 4 1/2 minutes total.  They taste awesome and my husband, who HATES nuts, said \"wow, I could eat a whole lot more of those!\"",
