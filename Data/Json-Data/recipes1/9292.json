This was a perfect solution.  In addition to triming the stem and root, we took a strip of skin from the center.  I didn't have plum vinegar so used rice wine vinegar instead.  I rated this 5 stars because I have never steamed radishes before so I don't have anything else to measure it by except the one experience and they were great.  I would make these again.",

It's true, you do need a specific palette to appreciate these babies.  If you are fond of some of the more undervalued asian flavors, like kimchi for example, then you should most certainly enjoy this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was that I did not heat any of the ingredients.  I just sliced the radishes and added them to the jar raw and poured the room temperature liquid over top.  This way they retained most of their crispness, as well as any vitamins and minerals that may have been lost during the heating process.  Although, it will take more like three days to reach peak flavor if you pickle them raw.  If you want to cut some of the salty flavor, you could always add a little sugar (about 1/3 teaspoon).  If you add sugar, you will need to heat the water enough for the sugar to dissolve before you pour it into the jar.  I am not sure how long these will last in the fridge because I seem to empty a jar by myself in about two weeks or less.",
