I threw in a few seasonings (onion powder garlic powder italian seasoning) to give it a little more flavor. I used my Perfect Meatloaf Pan to cook this meat loaf--I had to reverse the brown sugar/ketchup to the top of the meat loaf as my pan has holes in the bottom for the grease to drain. A little over an hour in the oven and fifteen minutes to rest and we were ready to go. Not bad--this was a quick meat loaf that paired well with mashed potatoes and was nice and firm for sandwiches the next day.",

I make a few changes to this recipe I did use cracker crumbs and a bit of oatmeal as well as some bread crumbs and added garlic to the meat mixture & to the ketchup sauce I added dried mustard & Worcestershire sauce but other than that followed the recipe.

It was nice that I didn't have to figure out a topping later on and it baked with the meatloaf on the bottom. My only changes were I believe the lean ground beef I had was a 2 lb package. I chose to use 1 tsp of salt instead of 1.5 tsp. I figured extra salt could be added and ketchup had plenty. The only bread crumbs I had were panko so that is what I used. After 1 hour there was a lot of liquid on the top and the onions didn't seem fully cooked. I scraped off the extra liquid sprayed the top with a little olive oil to crisp it up some and put it back in the oven. It actually took a full 30 minutes longer. That was no problem as long as it was fully cooked along with the onions. I turned it out onto a foil lined baking sheet with sides. I suggest that unless a large platter is available as it does produce some excess tomato liquid that can get messy. I got 11 1\" slices approximately from one loaf at 196 calories each as made above.

And the low fat milk and whole wheat crumbs are of negligible difference nutritionally overall. To actually make this healthier sub 3/4 of an 8 oz can of tomato sauce for milk use only 1 egg sub 1/3 C oatmeal for bread crumbs and for the topping use remaining 1/4 can of tomato sauce mixed with up to 2 tsp brown sugar Splenda ( stronger taste and sweetening power).
