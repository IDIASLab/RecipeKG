A decent and easy meal - esspecially w/ garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.",

I probably used less bbq sauce and mustard than the recipe called for - and probably half the cheese. At any rate this was a very easy recipe even for a Monday night. We put steamed broccoli and a little cucumber salad on the side. Everyone was satisfied. My husband said it was one of the best things we'd had in a long time. Thanks!",
