Use at least 1/2 cup of chopped carrots, onions and celery.  Add 2 tsp of Kitchen Bouquet.  Add 1 tsp of flavor enhancer.  And use at least 2 lbs of good quality minced beef (not ground).  Try is with these additions and you'll love it.  I make the roux in a saucepan, add the consomme, then put the rest of the ingredients in a slow cooker.  Let it cook all day on low and you'll come home to a marvelous meal.",

Beef stock is a much better product than the beef cubes.  I used reduced sodium beef broth in cartons combined with vegetable broth cartons to equal 1/2 gallon.  The cartons have a better flavor than canned broth -used Swanson's. In addition to the 1 lb. of round steak I added 1 sirloin steak minced cooking it the same way as the ground round.  Drain the meat after cooking but reserve the drippings.  If soup needs thickening toward the end of cooking, make a roux with the drippings to stir in to the soup--added flavor & no waste.  Smart Balance is good but I still prefer using unsalted butter though I reduced it to 1 1/2 sticks.  If you must add diced potatoes, do so but know that it does alter the orginal recipe and makes it a stew instead of a steak soup; I think it tastes fine with out them but I grew up on this soup and it seems odd to add them.  I am not a fan of stewed tomatoes so I subbed 1 can diced tomatoes without any seasonings.  ",

I just didn't see how 1 carrot and 1 stalk of celery could be divided by 16 servings of soup. Next time I will cut the ground pepper down because it was a little too hot for my 3 year old. One soup trick I learned when working at a soup kitchen is to boil the carrot peels celery tops and onion skins in the water to make a stock. After it has simmered for several minutes strain out the peels and use the liquid in place of the water. It really adds a nice flavor and richness to the soup.",

I did add thyme, red wine, a little garlic powder, extra pepper, and kosher salt, all to the soup prior to simmering. I also used unsalted butter. I liked how this turned out, but I think I'll play around with the vegetables in the future, as I didn't love the combination. I think I'll put in fresh carrots, celery, onions, peas, lima beans, and green beans in next time instead of frozen. Anyway, loved it and will definitely make many more times!!!",
