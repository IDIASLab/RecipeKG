I used a box brownie mix for this (cuts way back on the preparation time); for the mint topping, I only used 1 cup of powdered sugar for the 1/2 cup of butter, and instead of creme de menthe used 1 1/2 tsp of mint extract.  This made it not too sweet.  After it cooled in the fridge applied the chocolate topping,then placed back into fridge overnight and brought into work next morning.  Coworkers loved it.",

One friend a die-hard no-cheat low-carber had 2! I used my own fudgey brownie recipe chilled it. Topped with with the mint frosting (my Reese brand creme de menthe was not very minty even with 4 Tbsp next time I'll use a touch of mint extract also) - be sure and chill this well it helps the next layer spread. I tried melting my chocolate twice (once melting the butter separately) but both times they appeared to \"seize.\" But I just used it (both actually) on top and it was fine once chilled. I would recommend spreading a small area of chocolate at a time or your chocolate will chill too fast and will be really hard to spread.",

I went a little overboard with the mint extract ( I subbed mint extract- which is more concentrated- for the mint liqueur). The mint layer was borderline toothpaste-y! OOPS! Overall great taste.",
