Instead of dredging my pork chops I put the flour salt pepper and some Adobe all purpose seasoning in a zip lock bag put in the pork chops and shook until covered. I shook off the excess before I put them in the frying pan. The pork chops really were tender. I think the next time though I'll use a smaller can of tomato sauce. Hate throwing out a Good gravy",
