Everyone ate it and said they enjoyed it but there was a discussion about the sweetness and the amount of sugar called for. I had to use ground cardamom (couldn't find whole). I also made it in the rice maker to save time and space. I added the food color and 1 teaspoon cardamom to the rice maker with the rice and water (no soaking). When that was finished I heated 1 1/2 teaspoons cardamom in oil and added cooked rice sugar and 2 cups of skim milk. I let this simmer about 5 minutes and added the nuts fruits and ricotta. It was delicious in the end.",
