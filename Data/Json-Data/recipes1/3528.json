I doubled the barley, used 4 cans of beef broth and one can of chicken broth (no bouillon), and added a third cup of wine towards the end as well - it was delicious!  I tried it once with fresh thyme from the garden  (added it towards the end) and that added a nice flavor to it.  If you double the barley, add more liquid, else the barley will soak up all the soup and you will have stew.\r\n\r\nI tried it once with regular mushrooms and once with half fresh shitake mushrooms.  The shitakes gave it a little better flavor in everyone's opinion, but it was great both ways.\r\n\r\nI tried it once with small meatballs (Italian wedding soup style) since I didn't have a beef roast in the house.  This was terrible.  Definitley stick with a decent shoulder or other roast cut into small cubes.\r\n\r\nThis soup is best the second day so make plenty extra.  Serve with a good crusty french loaf toasted.\r\n",

I used 3/4 c. barley which required 1-2 c. more water.  You might want to add another bouillon cube.  After I browned the beef, I added 6 cups of water and 1/2 c. red wine (a must for a full-bodied beef soup) and simmered it for an hour while I prepared the vegetables and sauteed them.  Then I added the barley to the beef broth along with 4 c. of water and simmered until the barley was tender.  I added the vegetables right at the end and heated through.  I, too, forgot the sour cream.  But it was so yummy, we didn't miss it.",

I let the soup simmer for about an hour with the beef, seasonings, onions, garlic.

Then simmered the beef with 2 cups of beef stock, 2 cups of chicken stock (the magic ingredient, in my mind) and 1 cup of Merlot (or any decent red wine). (Use low sodium brands if possible). I also add a few spoonfuls (maybe 1tblsp total) of \"Better than Bouillion\" for the concentrated beef taste and a splash of worchestershire sauce...... Simmered for a least 2 hours or until the beef was nice and tender. Sauted the veggies in some olive oil.....added an extra carrot, a parsnip, used fresh baby portabella's that were diced instead of sliced.....and added to the soup pot along with a full cup of barley and another cup each of merlot and beef broth ..Cooked for another 70 - 80 minutes or so. As the barley cooked, I adjusted the amount of liquid as needed (adding your choice of beef broth/stock; water and demi-glace or a product like \"better than bouillion\" or wine. Forgot all about the sour cream....I'll try adding that when I have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.",

Simmered it a good long time to make it tender. When I added the meat with the veggies I added more Merlot. Used all the veggies called for plus parsnips...my personal favorite. Used what I had on hand...3lbs of stew meat, so I adjusted the recipe for the extra meat. Don't forget the sour cream at the end..I did. But added it to the last few bites and I have to say, I liked it better with the sour cream. So did the rest of the family. But, it was good either way. The writer that mentioned not to put the drippings in with the veggies was right. Added flavor but had to skim lots of oil off the top.",
