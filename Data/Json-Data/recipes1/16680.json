I thought 10 minutes was a bit long, but went with it because I don't usually cook much in the microwave, so wasn't too sure of an appropriate cook time. Well, 10 minutes was indeed too long. The potatoes came out really dry and the tapered ends were completely inedible and rock hard from being overcooked. After looking up other recipes, it seems that 5 minutes is an appropriate cook time. Also, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon is way too much. I didn't even use 1 teaspoon, and that was plenty. I also cut back on the salt, and I'm a salt lover. I would make these again because of the ease, but would adjust the cook time, cinnamon and salt.",
