I added about 4 oz of processed cheese (velveeta type) and about 1/2 cup sour cream just to make it even creamier. You won't taste the sour cream. Great without the breadcrumbs too. Nice comfort food. And even easier to make if you just mix everything together then add the macaroni and mix well. This insures every piece of pasta is covered.",

It sounded like it had the potential to come out greasy because of the 3 1/2 cups of Cheddar so I used half Cheddar and half Kraft Melts (4 cheese combo). It turned out nice and creamy and not runny as others might have mentioned. Keep in mind when measuring pasta they don't mean 8 fluid oz (or 1 cup). They mean 1/2 pound. I think this is what confused some people.",
