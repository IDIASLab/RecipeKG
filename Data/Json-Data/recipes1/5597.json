I had some so why not cut the fat?! I also used 1 full cup of frozen (not thawed) blueberries.  Any fruit bread I make gets a dash of cinnamon, fresh nutmeg and vanilla -just a dash of each.  I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar also (personal preference) I baked it in 3 mini loaf pans on a cookie sheet and it still took almost the full cook time. Crunchy on the outside and moist and yummy in the center!  I don't think I would try this bread in a large bread pan, it may have never been cooked through.  My 10 year old ate almost a full tin by himself!  Perfect for a Sunday morning treat!  Thanks",

Next time I'll try half apple sauce, half oil - the sauce makes the crust a bit rubbery rather than classic crunchy, it also changes the flavor some. I was trying to be healthy, but some things aren't worth it. I'm going to make it again, and I do think putting the oil back into it will make it an exceptional bread. Very hearty. The only other change I made - well my husband got blackberries instead of blueberries so banana blackberry quick bread it was. I was hestitant at first but the berries held together and came out great in the bread. A nice variation. As for my husband, we are going to go to the grocery store together and review our fruits.",
