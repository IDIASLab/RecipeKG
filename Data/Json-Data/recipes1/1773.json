I believe these attempts kept the cake moist.  I also added cream cheese frosting while the cake was still warm.  End result mmm good, reminded me of spice cake.  Update: I just had another piece of cake after it had cooled and it did turn out dry like cornbread. I'm baffled.",

My cake was delicious and moist even the next day.  My only alteration was the addition of ginger.  Yum, Yum.\n\nI also paired this with the Caramel frosting VI recipe from this site.",

Not at all dry and can't even tell there are oats in it!...ok thinking it over I made a lot of changes which I will share so you too can enjoy this cake...only used 1/2C. Wheat flour in addition to the white also didn't use a whole cup of oats 1C. White sugar and 1/2 brown instead of all brown 1/2C melted coconut oil and 1/3C Apple sauce. I dumped the pear on top once the batter was in the dish (9x13) and just pushed it down into the batter. I didn't want all the pear at the bottom.",
