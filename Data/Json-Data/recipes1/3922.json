I just made a bowl now, after it being in the fridge overnight and wow!  It isn't dry at all and the flavors have really mingled and developed!  I followed other's suggestions and used half balsamic vinegar instead of all red wine vinegar.  I also used rotini pasta, regular tomatoes, portobello mushrooms, red and green bell peppers, and a small purple onion. I left out the pepperoni just because I didn't have any, but next time I'll definately add it. As good as it tastes, if you do use balsamic, be warned that the pasta and feta will look brownish.  I think someone else mentioned this, but if you're making for company, you might want to use white balsamic vinegar. This is soooo good, thank you for the great recipe!",

I recommend that you start with approx. 1/4 cup of vinegar (you can adjust and add more if you like) using half red wine vinegar and half balsamic as suggested by other reviews.  I substitute 1 can artichoke hearts-not marinated-for the mushrooms.  I also used diced red and yellow peppers for extra color and sliced olives. I prefer red onions instead of green onions and use tomato basil feta cheese and bowtie pasta. Yummy and beautiful 5 star salad!",

Some of the modifications she made was using a mix of yellow, red and green bell peppers for color.  She also added some artichokes and replaced the cherry tomatos with sun dried tomatoes.  And she cut the amount of mushrooms by half.  But the taste was amazing.  Note: if you don't like vinegrette type dressings, then you will not like this salad because the vinegar taste really comes through.  (Which is what gives this pasta a great kick and Greek flavor!)  I love it!  Recipe is a keeper!",

Wow...those seem like a lot of changes but I don't think it affected the overall essence of the dish. Definitely let it marinate overnight.
