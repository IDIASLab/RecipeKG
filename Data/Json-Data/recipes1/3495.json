I also upped the buttermilk to 1/4 c. and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the batter. I used three apples: one shredded and two chopped. I did two of these. One I made a topping for: 1/4 c. brown sugar 1/4 c. flour 2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/4 c. of butter. Combine the sugar flour and cinnamon in a bowl then cut the butter in until it resembles course crumbs. Halfway through baking sprinkle over top so it doesn't sink into the cake. The other one I did a caramel sauce: 1/4 c. brown sugar 1/4 c. butter 1/8 c. of cream (or half and half) bring to a boil and boil for 3 minutes remove from heat and add 1/4 tsp. of vanilla. Let cool slightly before pouring over warm cake. Either way they're delicious!!!!",

Excellent recipe! This cooked for much longer than I expected though (probably an extra 15 min) but that's probably because of the extra apples. Oh also I baked this in an 8x8 glass dish. I didn't think it would fit in a loaf pan! Delicious though. Absolutely a keeper!",

Like earlier reviewers I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and even some ground cloves I had just sitting around. I used slightly more than 1/4 cup of buttermilk and it was wonderful. At first I thought two apples would be too much judging by the huge mound on my cutting board but after baking the pieces shrank to give a nice distribution of apples throughout the bread. I had to bake mine for about 75 minutes but it came out perfect. Very moist and not overly sweet. My first time making an apple bread but I will surely be making them more often thanks to this recipe!:)",
