I followed the recipe exactly as written with a couple of modifications:  1. I used a fork to blend the mixture together forming something that had a much more pleasant texture and look. 2.  The recipe calls for unsalted butter. I did not have this available so I used regular salted butter.  I believe this made the tuna a bit more salty then one would like. Not overly salty but I always follow the rule you can add more after you taste but you can't take it out.  Definitely something that's easy to make, quick and an extremely tasty add-on to any grazing platter.",

I cut the butter to 2 Tbs, added a splash of olive oil, used two 3oz cans of tuna in olive oil, increased the Italian parsley to 1 C, added 1/2 C green onions, and increased the lemon to whatever comes out of half a lemon, about 2 Tbs. We served on toasted pumpernickel bagel halves with mini bell peppers on the side.  MMmmmm. The kiddos loved it too.",

It is typically about 2.6 oz instead of 4.5 oz called for in the recipe. I had only one packet so I cut the recipe back to 2 servings or sandwiches. I also followed the serving advice on making it into a sandwich. I made it according to directions but used olives instead of capers. I would like to try it again with the capers. I think they would be the perfect compliment. I have seen similar tuna spreads under French recipes. They typically call for olive oil instead of the butter are usually made with olives and have seen the tuna sandwiches with sliced boiled eggs. This is the closest I could find after another recipe dissapeared from the site that I had planned to try. It was quick easy healthy and a nice change from tuna with mayonnaise.",
