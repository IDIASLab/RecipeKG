It's more than enough ...trust me if you don't want to go into a sugar shock!!! lol  A thin layer is plenty sweet.  Thought this was useful to know, so ingredients aren't wasted.  Also, when applying the filling especially when you get anxious like me, it's easier to do it while the cookie is on a flat surface instead of trying to hold it in your hand or raised.  The cookie will break in half.  10 min. was perfect baking time.  It helps to refrigerate for a little while to ensure cookies aren't flat, but definitely flatten w/fork.  While it does flatten, to get that perfect cookie as pictured, it requires you to flatten a little.  Using ingredients that are room temperature helps w/the overall consistency of the final product.  These were a hit, and people are always amazed these were baked not bought!",

The trick is to avoid the temptation to over-bake them, because they don't LOOK done when they come out of the oven, but they set up nicely as they cool.  I make mine slightly bigger than the recipe says and bake for exactly 10 minutes, and let them cool four or five minutes before removing them from the sheet.  This is my new favorite.",

Over a double boiler over\nmedium low heat melt three 4 oz bars of ghiradelli\nsemi-sweet chocolate, or 12 oz of semisweet chocolate\nchips along with about 3-4 tbsp of crisco. Dip the cookies into the chocolate. I usually dip just one side. Sometimes I\ndip the whole top of the cookie. You could try the\nwhole cookie in chocolate, but thats pretty indulgent.\nAnyway, once dipped, set the cookies on wax paper. I\ndo this on the cookies sheets. Then I put a whole\nsheet of freshly dipped cookies in the freezer. This\nsets the chocolate. (You can also add sprinkles to the dipped cookies directly after dipping...I shake mine on.)",

I am not sure why (maybe handling of butter) but my cookies did not turn out thin like some of the pictures.  Mine puffed up so much that I had to slam them on the counter to deflat them a bit. All of my ingredients were room temp. and I used old fashioned oats (they make a chewier texture) and I used dark brown suger (when gives a little more richness), I also added vanilla extract to both the cookie and the filling.  All of these conditions added up to one of the best cookies I've ever had let alone baked myself.",

And you don't need to flatten the cookies because they flatten on their own while baking. I used skim milk in the filling instead of heavy cream and it was fine. Next time I will double the recipe and use more filling in each cookie sandwich! The user who said these taste like gourmet Nutter Butters was absolutely correct. Yum!!!",
