The coating trickled down the sides of my pan and through the batter causing a layer of syrup underneath the brownies. It made them a gooey mess after it was baked. It solidified into a candy like thing which was ok but not supposed to be in brownies.. I really liked how the top looked like the store bought ones and next time i would bake the brownies for a while before putting the coating on. Great addition to an old recipe but needs to be perfected",

On first examination everyone thought the topping was peanut butter... though they still liked it after they found out that wasn't the case. Two people asked for the recipe so it must be decent!
