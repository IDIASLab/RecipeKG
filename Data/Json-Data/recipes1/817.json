I took the advice of another reviewer and added a pinch of salt and a half teaspoon of vanilla or so. Also if you cook them a little longer like 12 to 15 minutes and also let the dough sit for 10 minutes after being in the fridge for 15 they aren't so cake textured. A good substitution for the walnuts is almonds and white chocolate chips. I loved these cookies with the proper adjustments.",

Not over-the-top in-yer-face death-by-chocolate but a very delicate mild flavor cut nicely by the nuts. The first bite actually tastes a bit bland but maybe a teeny bit of salt or vanilla could fix that. After that they're very good but subtle. Also I like that they stay pillowy soft for days. Overall I really like them but know your audience: a die-hard choco-holic would need to add a generous amount of chocolate chips or something!",

There is no way I could have made cookies out of the \"dough\" so I put it into a 13 X 9 in. pan and baked it like a cake. My husband said they tasted like brownies and they were delicious! I don't know why this happened I've been baking for years and have doubled recipes countless times before. Oh well they didn't go to waste and we had a yummy treat anyway! Maybe I will try them again without doubling the recipe and see what happens.",

I added about a tablespoon of cocoa baking powder and approximately 1/2 cup white chocolate chips. Yum! I took these warm from the oven to a meeting and they were gone in no time. Next time I think I'll try adding some instant coffee granules or flaked coconut for a different twist. Thanks for the recipe; it's really easy and quick to make and would be a good way to introduce children to the fun of baking.",

I also used cocoa instead of melted chocolate. The conversion is as follows: 1 square of chocolate = 3 Tbs. cocoa and 1 Tbs. butter. I used 9 Tbs. cocoa and 3 Tbs. butter so I did up the chocolate content but they came out with a really nice chocolate flavor. To make them a bit healthier I used one cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour and raw sugar instead of the white. The consistency was just right and that may have been because I used the whole wheat flour. I would definitely make these again.",
