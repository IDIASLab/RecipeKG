Only addition-I brushed beaten egg white on top and sprinkled sugar (what I normally do when I make scones)except 1 scone I left just as recipe says and the other I just brushed w/ egg white no sugar. I liked the ones w/ sugar but the best looking was w/ JUST the egg white brushed on (w/o sugar). I only did half the recipe (I wasn't sure if it would turn out) & got 9 nice sized pie-slice shaped scones. Give it a try its FUN and EASY and tastes WONDERFUL!",

I prefer to make this with an ice cream that has more of a plain base flavor like just vanilla or just pumpkin and add in blueberries fruit or nuts after I make the dough. Tried making this the first time with an icecream that had a fruit ripple but in mixing the ice cream with the flour it turned a really odd shade of pink because the ripple just disappeared. Anyways it is really good topped with cinnamon and course sugar or an oatmeal crumb topping. Very much worth your while. Recipe itself is perfect as is. Wouldn't change a thing!",

                "reviewBody": "This is really easy and the dough is extremely sticky but I have to say that every single scone recipe I've ever made has sticky dough. That's just the way scones are. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer and used the dough hook. Although the dough did climb the hook it was too sticky to act like regular dough but I only added maybe 1/2 c more of flour since I expected the stickiness anyway. I kind of expected these to be more scone-like than they are--they really remind me of sweeter biscuits. Good just not my vision of scones. I used peach ice cream and then after placing on the cookie sheet I brushed with butter extract and sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar. They aren't especially sweet and as other's noticed the flavor is relatively mild but scones (and biscuits) can be really good with jam or jelly so I'm not worried about that part of it. Especially as this is a recipe with only two ingredients so I'm not sure what others were expecting. I made my own self rising flour since I never have it on hand. Use 1 1/2 tspoons baking powder and 1/2 tspoons salt per cup of flour. Voila! Self rising flour. Not sure of all of the variations pple have come up on the reviews here; that's the recipe that I've always used and it always works for me. Thanks for the recipe; it used up some of my ice cream and was fun to try!",

It wasn't holding consistency very well so I added a little more flour. In addition I added 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract 1 cup of peanut butter and about half a cup of chocolate chips. My roommates devoured them! Adding more flour made them take about 25 minutes or so in the oven (we also don't have a kitchen timer). Can't wait to try it with other ice creams!",
