I reserved some of the frosting and folded in  strawberry preserves for a strawberry buttercream filling. Delicious, beautiful, and elegant cake.",

Also the bake time was 375 degrees for just 25 minutes (time was right on for my oven but check yours before 25 to be sure.)",

I consider myself a connoisseur of great cakes, and as such I rarely find recipes on this site to try, since most of them start with \"1 box white cake mix.\" I was thrilled to find an old-fashioned cake recipe like this! I made the cake as described with the exception of halving the salt since my husband's on a low sodium diet. I doubled the recipe for a 2-layer cake, and iced it with a vanilla buttercream frosting similar to Buttercream Frosting, but where the butter is melted first, as this gives much better consistency. I beat the eggs with a stand-up mixer for 10 minutes until they were very airy, and then as I added the heavy cream, I continued to beat it on a high setting. The result was a richly-flavored cake that was exceptionally moist and had a rather light crumb for its heavy ingredients. It was delicious. It was so good, I greedily brought the leftovers home with me instead of giving the to the birthday girl. (Note: do not calculate how many grams of saturated fat are in a double layer version of this cake with buttercream frosting. There's a reason it tastes so good.)",
