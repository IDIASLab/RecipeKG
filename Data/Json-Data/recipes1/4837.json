I thought the marinade was too sweet before I poured it on so I added more dijon mustard to it.  I discovered later that I didn't really need to do that because the spices balance out the sweetness perfectly.  I am not fond of chicken on the bone and next time I think I will try using breasts as someone else had suggested.  The spices on this recipe are perfect-don't change a thing!!!",

That said the underlying flavor of the apricot and honey was so tantalizing that I am going to try this again using regular mustard and maybe a little less of it. I doubt I could make any honey-mustard chicken now without adding the apricot jam. Thanks for the great idea!",
