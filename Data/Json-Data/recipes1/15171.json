(I let it sit out at least 1/2 hour after removing from loaf pan).  If you serve right out of the freezer, it is kind of tasteless, but is delicious when it melts a little.  Also, I made the mistake of using a store brand once, but real Cool Whip tastes much better.   Other points I discovered after reading  reviews and also making a few times: Get 12 oz. Cool Whip to have enough to use in the recipe and to be able cover the entire loaf at serving time. I use 10 oreos plus 1 1/2 tbsp. butter for a more substantial crust. This keeps well in the freezer.  You can make it a couple of weeks in advance so there's one less thing to do when preparing for company.   All in all, it's a good summer dessert.  ",

Make sure to line the loaf pan with foil as this helps it to come out easily. I quickly figured out that you could use almost any type of fruit to make this and it would still be super yummy! I'm going to make it again for Memorial Day but I think I'm going to use peaches or mandarin oranges with the graham crust. UPDATE: Me & my big ideas! I made this for a third time using mandarin oranges as I had threatened to do before. It didn't come out so well but I think I know why: using a lg. can of the oranges I did drain the liquid but I think they needed to be drained AGAIN after mashing. The flavor was terrific and after about a full day it was completely frozen but that was just the leftovers--we ate it without the fancy topping anyway and it was a bit more like a really oold yogurt consistency but still very very tasty. So I think I will do it again with a double draining for any type of canned fruit that I might use.",
