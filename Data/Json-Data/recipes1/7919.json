Only the eggs and walnuts contribute fat to this recipe. I also rolled some of the cookies in powdered sugar before baking them; they turned out very cute (without the powdered sugar they're pretty unimpressive brown lumps). My German professor had seconds and thirds so I call this a success. (But I found that they didn't need to be baked quite as long as the recipe called for. 10 minutes is about sufficient).",

You can really taste the citrus as well as the spices and I was glad to find a recipe that does not add fat besides the eggs since this is traditional for coffee dunking cookies. They stayed a little soft in the middle so maybe bake a little longer than specified to get a totally crispy cookie. I had to alter this recipe a bit by ading flour until I could roll the balls - the dough was too wet. Try an extra 1/2 cup or so. This did not deter from my rating...they were delicious - many compliments from all my friends. Thanks for sharing this Deutsch treat!",

I also divided the recipe. I wasn't sure what 'thick' meant but just let it mix on high for awhile. The dough was suprisingly not really sticky and was able to shape them somewhat. NOW out of the oven they're really pale!! Didn't spread much at all..They were soft airy kinda cake-like in texture an mmm I really liked them!! Would def. make again for a healthy?? cookie and will use as a base for other butterless cookies but will try to add some color..somehow. THANKS for the recipe =) P.s..just realized I didn't sift",
