And I send him back with mini-pies (using giant muffin foil tins and lots of plastic wrap, it gets through TSA).  He loves this pie. He wants to marry this pie.    Demand is growing and my friends, family, coworkers are expecting this too.  I'm going to have to mix it in the bathtub this year.     Don't worry about the meat, it adds flavor and texture, but this is dessert, not at all like chomping on a steak.  Though a slice will do me quite nicely for lunch :).   If you have trouble finding the ingredients, I get my peel, cherries, and currants from nutsonline.  I also make it a month ahead and stir it every few days, adding a dash of brandy every few days (to the pie mix, not me, well, usually not me).   I've successfully frozen it too for longer keeping.  2 weeks to pie-day!",

It smelled wonderful when I would stir it weekly. I made traditional mince pies (mini pies) for Thanksgiving and only made a dozen thinking no one but my husband would eat them. I was so wrong! They were delish! Hearty spicy and sweet! I made another two dozen and had plenty of mincemeat left over for Christmas. I froze the rest of the mincemeat and made another two dozen for Christmas. This is now a regular recipe for us. Thanks so much for giving us a new and delicious family tradition!",

This time I decided to try to make some from scratch as my son and daughter-in-law asked me to for their Victorian style Christmas dinner (they are experimenting with old-fashioned meals; they no doubt thought that Mom should experiment too). I chose this recipe because it was rated highly--I found out for good reason! Wow! This recipe has changed my mind about mincemeat! While I didn't have all the ingredients (I used ground venison instead of beef used good sipping brandy instead of apple cider--increased the amount of brandy by another half cup and used chopped up tart dried cherries instead of the cherry preserve) it nevertheless came out tasting great! I am now a fan of mincemeat pie and will make this great recipe again. Oh and I gave my son and daughter-in-law a sample and their response was \"Oh wow! These pies are unbelievable! Can't wait to have more!\"",
