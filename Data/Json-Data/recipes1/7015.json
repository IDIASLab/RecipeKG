Doubled the ginger & garlic powder, & used 4 cups of shredded coleslaw mix. I sauteed the cabbage mixture a little in 2T water & 2T soy sauce then added the pork & 1/2  t. chinese five spices. I used 1/3 C filling for the inside. We made 11 eggrolls not 8. Peanut oil is rather expensive which no one mentioned, I might try a different oil next time to save a few bucks. I found the egg roll wrappers in the produce section near the vegetables if anyone else had trouble find them, ( I looked in the Asian section initially then had to ask a store employee). My husband LOVED these. I served them with Fried Rice Restaurant Style & Broccoli Beef I from this site. Thank you!\n\n\nEdit 12/10/12\nThis is how I now make these: Doubled the ginger & garlic powder, & used 16 oz bag of shredded coleslaw mix in the filling. I sauteed the cabbage mixture a little in 2 T water & 2 T soy sauce then added the pork & 1 t. Chinese five spices. I used 1/3 C filling for the inside. We make 15 eggrolls. We brush them with vegetable oil then bake them on a sheet pan at 425 degrees for 20 mins, turning over after 10 mins. Much healthier to bake them & less of a hassle than frying.",

They were delicious but they are not very \"jazzy.\" To quote Emeril \"You gotta kick these up a notch or two.\" We experimented and added hot sauce to the mix and next time (we WILL make them again) we are going to add garlic etc. We don't like things crazy spicey but these egg rolls as is are just way too bland.

I also used a package of coleslaw for the cabbage and carrots, made it much easier.   I mixed the cabbage in with the meat after it was cook to help make the rolling easier.  I also added about 1 tablespoon soy sauce to the meat mixture as other reviews suggested as well.  \n\nI tried deep frying, frying in a skillet with a little oil and baking in the oven.  I found that deep frying them make them very greasy.  baking in the oven made the egg roll wrapper rubbery. Frying in the skillet with just a little oil was the best, they weren't too oily and were still crunchy.  \n\nI've made these with both the seasoned sausage and plain ground sausage and I prefer the plain.  These rolls are very meaty and with the seasoned sausage it was just too over powering.   I uploaded a picture of one of the egg rolls I made picture #26.  It shows you the inside of the roll so you can see how meaty these guys are.  I was thinking about adding more cabbage, but my family protested saying they liked them the way they are, nice and meaty.\n\nI made Sweet and Sour Sauce II from this site to go with these egg rolls and it was the best sweet and sour sauce too!  I will differently be making these over and over again! YUM",
