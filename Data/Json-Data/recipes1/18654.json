The only downside was the amount of herbage inside. I couldn't finish this no matter how good it was because there was simply too much green stuff and it was kind of woody and similar to eating lots of grass or leaves on a sandwich in texture so minus points for that... I reread the directions and I didn't make an error but wow there had to be a mistake somewhere the way mine turned out. Thanks this can be modified to be fabulous.",
