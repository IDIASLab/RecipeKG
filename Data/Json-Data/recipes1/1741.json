I did make some changes to the recipe. First I baked it in the Pampered Chef silicone flower cupcake pan. Next I added a half teaspoon more rose water to the batter & frosted the cupcakes with a powdered sugar glaze with rose water & a few drops of red food color to make it pink. They were really pretty I would be great to serve at a bridal or baby shower. I think the main change I would make next time is to use rose extract rather than rose water.",
