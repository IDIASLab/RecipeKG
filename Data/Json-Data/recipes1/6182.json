It says \"45 minutes prep time,\" but it took me much longer (start to finish more like 2 and a half hours).  If you had 2 people working on it, one working on reducing the cream sauce and the other working on the stuffing, it would go along much faster.  If you're going to invest the time in this (and it is delicious -- really), consider making a double batch and freezing some for later.  It would make an excellent meal for a party because you can do most of it ahead of time... just serve it with a nice salad and some bread and you're good to go!",

I used the vegetable filling between the pasta layers and layering the sauce over each layer.  It was delicious!  I left out the mushrooms, added spinach.  The only reason I have given this a 4 star rating is because the sherry flavor was a tad too strong and the dish itself was just a bit too rich.  When I make it again, I will cut down the sherry and maybe use 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the cream.  Also, adding tomatoes or something to the sauce could cut the richness.  As it was, I served this dish with a tomato vinaigrette salad which helped to cut the richness a bit.  Excellent dish, thank you!",

What I ended up with was delicious and I'm sure the recipe as originally given would have been just as good.  I cannot eat bell peppers so I substituted yellow squash.  I couldn't find shallots so I used small green onions. Because I used a large eggplant and then added the squash, I had filling for 14 noodles and even had some filling left over.  That meant I needed more sauce to cook the dish in so, I added a can of Del Monte Italian Stewed Tomatoes (pureed) and a can of tomato sauce. I liked the flavor the cream and wine added to the tomato sauce.  I will definitely make this again!",
