Also, if you put the sour cream on the chicken and refrigerate for at least an hour, the sour cream will stick to the chicken when you add the cornflakes and bake them.  You will NOT need 2 cups sour cream!  More like 3/4 cup.  I added 1/2 pack Ranch dressing seasoning to sour cream.  I also seasoned the cornflakes generously with garlic salt, onion salt and seasoned salt.  My chicken breasts were large and cooked in 50 minutes.  Longer than that, they probably would have been dry.  I also left off the margarine and didn't need it.  With these few tweaks, this was a delicious way to prepare chicken!  My husband says this is his new favorite chicken dish!",

I seasoned my thick chicken breasts real well first with Garlic salt, Pepper, Italian seasonings.(Generous amounts) then in a large zip lock bag, i added half sour cream, half ranch dressing, tossed the Chicken in there and marinated overnite. It really brings out the flavor, then i used the shake and bake hot and spicy mix, added my own seasonings to that because i love spicy, So added more Italian seasonings, a little garlic powder, Parmesan cheese, drizzled with butter. I put foil at the bottom of my baking dish, made a difference in the cleanup and browning of the chicken, I agree with someone, 60 min is way too long for this dish, i baked it at 400 for 35 minutes.Let me tell you, it was soo moist and tender, i literally used my fork to cut the chicken, never used a knife. And talk about Flavor. Its worth the extra step of marinating it overnite. Thank you for this recipe.",

I'm a vegetarian, so I've not tasted this myself, but my 2 1/2 year-old son who has never eaten more than a few bites of any chicken (including nuggets dipped in ketchup) devoured a 1/2 breast! He started eating before we even said the blessing! My husband also really liked it, so it will become one of my staple recipes.  I love it because it is easy (I don't have a lot of experience cooking meat so it has to be easy) and it uses ingredients I always have in the house. I followed the suggestion to put dry onion soup mix in the sour cream. I used half of a package for 1 cup of sour cream. I only had 3 chicken breasts (they were large) so I used 1 c. sour cream and had plenty left over. I used 2 cups of cornflakes and had to crush up more. Because I used the soup mix in the sour cream I only added a very little amount of pepper and garlic powder to the cornflakes. The chicken was VERY tender! It was incredibly simple and a big hit with the family. Thanks!",
