I made the recipe as presented with these additions:  Sauteed fresh, sliced mushrooms with asparagus.  Diced up some left over honey glazed ham and added to the batter.  Used a pinch of thyme and basil in the batter.  Prepared as written put in the oven.  20 minutes before taking out I topped with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and continued to bake until cheese started to crisp at the edges.  Because of the ham I used unsalted butter and omitted the salt in the recipe.  Put salt on the table for those who thought they needed it.  Will definately use Chef John's recipe again!",
