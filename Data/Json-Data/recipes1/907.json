I read that some people thought less nuts but I completely disagree. It's an amazing recipe. Thank you Linda for sharing.",

A little confusing for a first-time pie baker like me but it all turned out well in the end and everyone else liked it too. Try hazelnuts as a replacement for the macadamia - also great!",
