I would recommend dipping the bread slices into the melted butter and sprinkling brown sugar on the outsides of the slices to give it a touch of extra sweetness. I found it to be just sweet enough so I don't know how it would've been had I not added that. Perhaps I could've put more chocolate instead but I didn't want it to overflow and found it to be the perfect consistency as is. This recipe has a very interesting flavor-- peanut butter and chocolate lovers should definitely give it a try!",
