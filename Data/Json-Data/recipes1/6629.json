I used \"Basic Flaky Pie Crust\" from this site instead of pre-made crust, and used fresh mushrooms, carrots, brocolli, beans instead of their frozen counterparts.  I also added granulated onion, some thyme, cheddar cheese, and used only one large potatoe (any more would be overkill).  I didn't have any pie tins to accomodate this big pie, so used a 9x13 casserole instead and it turned out great.  If you are looking for a good chicken pot pie recipe, you can trust that this one will exceed your expectations.",

I changed it a fair amount (mostly b/c I didn't have all the ingredients)& it turned out great. I added 3 cloves of smashed garlic to the chicken water instead of garlic powder & I didn't have any frozen veggies or celery so I just used a combo of potatoes baby carrots (which I added to the boiling potatoes) & onions. Also instead of a pie crust I topped with biscuit dough. I only cooked it for approx 30 mins and it was perfect. Great recipe...both my kids loved it.",

Cooked for about 5 minutes then added the flour cooked until it was a little thick. I added the chicken broth and milk to this cooked until it became thick. Seasoned it with pepper and celery seed. I used the 9 inch pie crust rolled it a little to fit a 10\" pie pan topped it with the other crust (because other reviews said it made too much filling.) baked it for 45 min. at 350.
