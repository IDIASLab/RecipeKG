I used a heaping teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice vs. cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. I also added a generous helping of vanilla to the batter. Next time I might add walnuts or mini chocolate chips. These were oh so good topped with maple syrup and a dollup of whipped cream dusted with a little pumpkin pie spice - YUM!!!",

I normally like a lighter crispier waffle but these were so flavorful it more than made up for the fact that it never got crisp no matter how long I cooked it. Only change I made was to use real sugar. Barring a health reason if you're just watching calories I'm not sure why you wouldn't use real sugar...2T is only 96 calories or 16 calories per waffle. I'll leave the sugar in and skip the butter and syrup on top...these are so yummy they don't even need any topping! Thanks for the recipe!",
