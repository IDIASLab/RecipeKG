I made the BBQ sauce without changing one ingredient.  I used Bacardi rum and two teaspoons of minced garlic (I'm too lazy to crush cloves).  When the ribs were done I put them in a big Zip-lock bag and poared all the BBQ sauce over it and put it in the refrigerator over night.  I took the ribs out of the BBQ marinate and grilled them.  I poared the left over marinate in small pan and simmered it while the ribs were cooking.  When I served the ribs I covered them with the steaming hot BBQ marinate.  My wife did not stop raving about how they were the best ribs she had ever eaten.  Better then any restaurant!  They are sweat so my two, very finicky daughters loved them too.  This recipe is a keeper and will be in our family rotation from now on.",

For those who comment that this is too sweet, I am guessing you bought CHILI sauce.  The correct sauce to use is CHILEEEEEE (remember the \"E\").  You will find it in the \"Mexican Food\" area of your grocery store.  I was able to choose from mild or hot.  I chose \"mild\" because my kids and their taste.......I followed the recipe exactly for the sauce except I doubled it!  It is perfectly sweet/salty/spicy, better than my other homemade BBQ sauce by FAR!.......I boiled the ribs from frozen for an hour.  I poured liquid smoke, kosher salt and favorite spices in the boil water to give the meat an infused flavor.......After the boil, I removed ribs from water and saturated them with the sauce to marinate for a few hours.......Then, I baked for an hour at 350 degrees finishing with 5 minutes under the broiler.  UNBELIEVABLY TENDER!  Thank you for such an amazing recipe!",

It's the first time that my husband talked about ribs all day. They were so tender juicy and the flavor was just perfect. I've made many recipes from this site.

Even dh was not impressed and he loves ribs of any kind. I think I'll stick to my old rib recipe. I didn't mind the sweetness but I think the rum was a bit too much. I am really disappointed that I wasted perfectly good ribs on this recipe. I think this is the first highly rated recipe that I have tried on this site that I did not like. We'll keep trying though.",
