This is really an excellent recipe. If you disagree it means you haven't yet made it or you accidentally blended in paint thinner. I like to replace most of the meats with turkey versions which i've convinced myself is completely healthy. It's still some of the best pasta sauce i've ever had. Be careful with the servings listed. I found that the \"12\" it lists would have to be pretty generous portions. In any case if you're looking for a meaty red sauce there is none better than this one. Make it once as is and then experiment - you're certain to fall upon something that your family or friends or random people you drag in off the street will walk away from the table with a smile - most likely discovering that they ate WAY more than they had planned.",

I only had 2 cans of diced tomatoes so I went with 2 cans of each of the diced and tomato sauce and just four cans of tomato paste. With roughly 1.5 hours remaining I added a big can of tomato puree to make up for the missing cans. I stayed with the recipe on spices except I added a tablespoon of sugar and a 3 tablespoons of garlic/onion spice mix. I also added pepperoni 2 green peppers and mushrooms (and extra minced garlic) none of which were called for in the recipe. Other minor changes: I chopped the onion in to bigger slices instead of small. I used shredded parmesan as a substitute for romano which I did not have on hand. All in all the changes worked out well. I thought it tasted great and my girlfriend loved it.",
