I know that drives some people crazy to change a recipe all around, but if it helps to tweak it, WHY NOT!?  This way there's a healthier version to play with.  Instead of all the butter I only used 1/4 cup of butter and added applesauce.  Then I only used 1 cup of brown sugar.  When I mixed in all the PB etc. I added one big banana too.  I put in 1 and 1/2 cups of raisins because we like them and heated up 1/2 cup apple juice to let the raisins soak in and then I used that \"raisin water\" in place of the water called for in the recipe.  I also added 1/3 cup of ground flax to give it some more good stuff.  We eat them in the afternoon for a healthy snack or when we're running out the door on a busy morning.",

Don't let the calorie section scare you, I made 27 cookies from one recipe and I used my ice cream scoop and when I measured how much dough the scoop holds it's 1/4 cup (that would make one serving 2 cookies plus like a bite of another cookie, one fills me up just fine).  BUT I make mine healthier and it's moist and holds together well and has to be less calories.  Here's what I did...no butter, add 1 c applesauce (unsweetened), used 1/2 c honey and 1/2 c brown sugar (in place of all the brown sugar), I also used all whole wheat flour and craisins (instead of raisins) - it's sooo good.  If you like a heartier cookie I'd use rolled oats, quick oats make a softer cookie - both are yummy.  If you like crunch in your cookies I think sunflower seeds would be great in them.  They also freeze well, plus I've made them with soy butter for an allergic child, it's a little drier but still good.",

Usually I make \"Ranger cookies\" that have lots of good-for-you fillers but tend to be dry and crumble easily.  This recipe just became my favorite!  I like to bake things with nutritional value but ... really what makes a cookie a cookie is fat and sugar.  A \"health\" cookie made with no fat, honey to sweeten and no eggs honestly isn't very satisfying.  This cookie gives me a real \"cookie fix\" yet is versatile enough to be quite nutritional.  \r\nI used natural peanut butter, substituted 4 egg whites for the 2 eggs (best to buy carton of pure egg whites), added 1/4 cup skim milk powder with the water, used all whole wheat flour (2 cups), and stirred in 1 c raisins, 1/2 cup mini choc chips, 1/2 cup chopped dates, 1 cup chopped walnuts.  The dough is chunky so it helps to flatten it a little (to 1\" thick or so).  Also, I found they only needed about 15 min or less to bake -- they turned out slightly browned with firm tops but inside they were surprisingly \"light\"and soft.  I used a wire wisk to beat the butter mixture and  to add the whites and water.  This may have helped.  I also would try adding dried cranberries, and other nuts & seeds.  \r\nI must say, I liked the results of this recipe so much that I have singlehandedly polished off 1/2 of the cookies in less than a week!   \r\nMay have to change the name to:\r\n \"Hearty Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner Cookies\"",

This recipe is perfect: easy yummy protein-rich and it produces really filling cookies. I subsituted 1/4 cup of applesauce for half of the butter (to cut down on the fat a little and add some more nutrients) and I also substituted 1/2 cup chocolate chips for half of the raisins and I threw in about 1/3 cup chopped walnuts. It's like trail mix in a cookie. If these freeze well I can see myself making this every two weeks or so and not having to worry about breakfast/lunch all semester. Thanks so much for sharing this.
