I left mine for two hours to cool if you try and remove them too soon the small outer circle around where you pushed in the peanut butter cup will be pulled off of course you can still eat the bottom of the cookie but it's best to wait. Also mine took about 12 minutes to bake they don't really brown but they start to look dry and a bit cracked when done. Thanks for sharing!",

The only change I made was baking them at 350 instead of 375 for 9 minutes turned out perfect. make sure you freeze the peanut butter cups before you unwrap them and put the unwrapped candies back in the freezer until the cookies come out of the oven makes them much easier to work with. Also I used mini-muffin liners they're cheap and it saves a lot of trouble getting them out of the pans. Thanks for an excellent recipe!!",

I rolled mine in Christmas sprinkles before placing in mini muffin tin and didn't press them in at all. It made them stand out even more while on display. Or You can add holiday sprinkles to the tops of the chocolate as it melts also. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly--though I do prefer to refrigerate the dough for a bit before handling it. They seem to stay fresh longer than most of the other cookies we exchanged. Have already made additional batches for gifts and for family since our first 6 batches were exchanged. I will keep this one as a holiday/any day tradition.",

Even though they basically fell apart on the plate and were hard to make they tasted very good! I think this is a good recipe for someone who doesn't really care about presentation but more about taste. I am not that person so that is why I have to give this recipe a 3 out of 4",
