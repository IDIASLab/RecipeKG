I accidentally cooked at 400 instead of 350, but it took a lot less time and still came out great!  Thanks for the great recipe!",

There is a few things we do differently....1st we use butter to grease the baking dish, 2nd we only use 3/4 cup of sugar (anymore is too sweet and takes away from the pineapple taste), 3rd thing we do a little differently is instead of creaming the butter and sugar together we whip the sugar and eggs together then mix the pineapple and the bread cubes in, last we mix in little cubes of butter. Pop it in the over until it's lightly brown on top. Absolutely Yummy!!!!!",

When we first took the dish out of the oven, I thought it would be too buttery.  The butter was bubbling all around the edges of the Pyrex glass dish.  After sitting for 10 minutes, however, the butter was incorporated into the dish and it was perfect!  Now the changes:  we don't like really sweet food, so we cut the sugar by half. We also followed the suggestions to use half brown (1/4 cup) and half white (1/4 cup) sugar, as well as we sprinkled the top liberally with pumpkin pie spice. Baked for half the recommended time covered, and half uncovered for the other half.   With these changes, it was a 5 star for us!   We have added it to our \"family\" cookbook!",
