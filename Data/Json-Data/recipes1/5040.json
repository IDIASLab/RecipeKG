If you like a french bread style, simply remove it from the bread machine after the second rise (it really won't rise that much) and place it in a french bread pan to bake. If you prefer a hearty textured high rise bread, simply add 2T oil (I used garlic flavored olive oil), 1T sugar, 2T gluten and you have a perfectly textured hearty high rise bread. Oh, I also added 5T Parmesan cheese and 1t garlic powder on the second try. This made it oh so flavorful. Thanks Kevin!",

Here's what I finally did: double the amount of yeast and replace the wheat bran with an equal amount of vital wheat gluten. No need to use boiling water on the tomatoes--just snip them as they come out of the package. I replaced the quinoa (what the heck is quinoa??) with 7-grain cereal. I also added about 1/4C honey--yeast does better with a bit of sugar in a recipe. Be sure to add enough flour so that the dough is not really sticky--the honey will increase the liquid content of the recipe so you will need more flour to balance that off. I added chopped nuts in my bread machine's extra cycle and used a variety of herbs including dried roasted garlic. It came out yummy and rose beautifully!",

It turns a very pretty orange color from the tomatoes and the bits of basil and quinoa give it a very unique and pretty look too. I don't suggest leaving the quinoa out; it gives it a nice look and texture and you can find it in the organic section of your market shelved with other grains. I made this by hand and made 16 dinner rolls that I baked on my pizza stone at 375 for 25 minutes. I brushed the tops of them with some egg white and they had a great brown crust on top when they were done. I'll be sure to make these again maybe with the addition of some jalapenos or some red pepper.",

The oil from the tomatoes would give the bread extra flavor. I give this a two thumbs down!",

Three things I have learned in baking bread whether in the bread machine or by hand is to use Rapid Rise Yeast and to proof it in 1/4 cup of the liquid called for in the recipe at the temperature of 120 degrees and no higher than 130 degrees and use flour designed for bread making. Use a thermometer. When using wheat products in the recipe or heavier grains such as oats I use gluten. A lot of people are allergic to these products but if you are not then use them. I rarely have a problem. I store my bread in the refrig. because we don't eat a lot of it and since there are no preservatives you need to do this. You can also freeze sliced bread in air tight zip locks. Enjoy bread making. It is enjoyable.",
