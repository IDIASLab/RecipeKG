Good as written, but a couple of clarifications on the recipe to make this better:  First, the crust turns out better if the butter is softened to the point of melting, but hasn't actually turned to liquid.  Second:  Press down on the bottom filling lightly; DO NOT tap down hard as you won't be able to get it out of the pan.  Third:  You must use quick oates NOT rolled oats on this recipe.  Helpful hints ~ First: For a change of pace, try half butterscotch and half chocolate chips or 1/2 caramel and 1/2 butterscotch topping for variety.  Second:  Slightly chill the carmelitas after they have finished baking.  This helps the  cooke bar \"set-up\".  This is the one tip you don't want to forget on this recipe.....  The carmelitas are great to make ahead, travel with or freeze to serve later.  As my son would say:  Scrumdiddlyumptios!  Enjoy!",

The caramel icecream topping is 1 cup - flour is the same.  You cook the final product 18-22 minutes - it took 22 minutes in my oven to produce a golden brown topping.\nAlso - a good TIP is that if you refrigerate the carmelitas 1-2 hours before cutting (this helps the filling set up), they will not be crumbly and will cut perfectly.  Plus - DON'T MELT THE BUTTER in the crust ingredients - just soften the butter (unsalted) to room temp.  You will get a much nicer crumb topping this way.\nThese bars are just wonderful!  Another recipe I saw for these used 3-4 chopped Granny Smith apples mixed with 1 tsp. cinnamon for the \"filling\" instead of the choc.chips/nuts - I'll bet that would be fantastic, too.  I'm going to try that combination next. ",

I also add 1 tsp of pure vanilla to the \"crust\" mixture.\n\nAfter making this several times, I've found the butter is the key to cookie consistency.  If you melt the butter and add it when it's still warm, the crust will be more cookie-like (think Toll House cookies on top and bottom.  If, however, you just soften the butter and add it at room temperature, they are more like bar cookies, with a distinct crust, chocolate chip & caramel layer, and a crumbly topping.  In addition, putting them in the fridge for an hour or so before cutting improves them even more.\n\nThese last about 2 days in our house and require at least a gallon of milk to be on hand. :)",
