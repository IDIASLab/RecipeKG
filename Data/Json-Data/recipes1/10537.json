Also, adding a little club soda to them will make them a lot fluffier if that's the texture you're looking for. Lastly, my absolute favourite way of eating these is to melt butter in a pan and fry some onions, then add the noodles and a good portion of grated cheese (cheddar or emantal work wonderfully) and then fry them until the cheese starts browning.",

My mother-in-law made great spaetzle and gave me a press. I tried this receipe and it is excellent and easy. I am submitting my own enhancements which added to the recipe. I added a pinch of nutmeg. I see this mentioned a few times. I recommend it. I used 1/2 c water & 1/4 c milk for the 3/4 c water. I let the dough rest on the counter for 5 hrs before pressing. I also used canned chicken broth instead of plain water to boil the spaetzle in. I was so proud!!! My husband's german cousin also says add a few pats of butter and put in a freezer bag or container and it freezes well, ready to use. The best!!",

Let the dough rest for 30 minutes after you have added all the ingredients so that the gluten can \"relax\".  Good eating!",

This is the correct recipe only you form a more stiff dough to make the Spaetzle rubbery as my husband calls them. Most Schwaebians use all eggs instead of adding water which will make them \"rubbery\". This depends on once taste if you want either the soft or the rubbery noodles. Either one is very good. Leftover Spaetzle can be fried in butter and scramble eggs into the noodles as they fry. Add some additional salt to season. I always add some cubed ham to it. Serve with fresh salads for a meal. Now that's authentic. P.S. Use a Spaetzle press or a Spaetzle Brett (you shave the spaetzle by hand in very thin strips and dip the cutter in the water every few cuts). Very time consuming if you are not used to it. You can get an authentic press but they are not cheap.",
