The only adjustments I made was cutting the red pepper to 1/2 tsp. (still plenty spicy for us) and using 12 oz of whole wheat spaghetti. I would probably use 8-10 oz next time. (there are only 3 of us) This is really worth a try. Awesome flavors and looks impressive too! I cut the ham into small matchsticks per the Allrecipes magazine.",
