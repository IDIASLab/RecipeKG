I used 2 cups Minute rice & 2 cups of water & about 1 tsp. Cajun Seasoning instead. It was perfect. I used 13 med size shrimp instead of 1/2 cup. I also used the diced tomatoes with green chili's so didn't need to add extra Creole Seasoning. It also never said to add the 2 mixtures together at the end but I did. I would make this over again. Thanks Johnsonville.",

The recipe called for shrimp but in the recipe directions it said shrimp or chicken so I used chicken since I already had it in my freezer. I think our issue was the flavor of the rice with the diced tomatoes. It had too strong of a tomato flavor for us. I think if I had used the spicy tomatoes with chilies like another reviewer we might have liked it better. That being said - we thought the Johnsonville sausage had a really good flavor and I will definitely buy that again to use in a different recipe.",

The seasonings add enough flavor that I'd rather use plain white rice next time and skip the additives from a boxed rice. That would help with the sodium content too. A few tweaks and I think this would be pretty tasty.",
