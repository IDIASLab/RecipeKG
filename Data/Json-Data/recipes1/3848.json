The only changes I made to this recipe is that I substituted a jar of Alfredo Sauce for the half-and-half.  What a wonderful flavor it gave it.  Also, since I bought a 2 cup bag of shredded mozzarella cheese, I used it all because my son loves the cheese!  This is a keeper I'll make over and over again!  Thank you!!!",

My family requested I make some sort of pasta dish and I searched and found this one. The fact that it had brown gravy in the ingredients made me really curious (plus all the rave reviews!). I can't tell you enough how tasty and wonderful this baked pasta was. As usual, I changed up a few things though. I added two cut up sweet italian sausages with the ground beef (seasoned meat with adobo, garlic powder, and pepper); used a 10.5 oz of brown gravy with onions; used 2 kinds of cheeses - swiss and mozzerella (and I layered pasta, cheese, pasta, cheese). The outcome was SPECTACULAR!!!!! Will make this again. It was a BIG HIT!!!!!",

Not sure how long I cooked it...I just took it out once the cheese was melted & bubbly on top!",
