I use light olive oil or safflower oil as opposed to the corn oil. When I make the croutons, after the 30 minutes in the 275 oven, I turn off the oven, and let the croutons stay in, until completely cool.  F.Y.I., the baguette should be approximately 1/3 pounds worth.\r\nOne last tip---of late, I've substitued the 1/4 tsp. dry mustard, with 2 tsps. of dijon mustard. The dressing comes out creamier, and I really dig the flavor.\r\nCheers all,\r\nJeff",

I have made it a half dozen times for my family and guests, and everyone agrees it the best they have ever had!  Thanks for the posting.  You have done a great justice.",

I only added 1/4 Worcestershire to the croutons and it was great.  I used 1 tbsp minced garlic instead of crushed cloves.  And I used 1/4 cup of pasterized egg instead because coddling an egg doesn't kill any present bacteria and will actually increase bacteria activity.  Anyway, try this recipe.  I will make this over and over again.  Thanks, Jeff.",

I made this for my family for my Mom's birthday and it was a huge hit. The croutons were also a smash hit everyone loved them. The only thing I'd change is omitting the salt in the recipe - as the anchovies more than make up for it. I also didn't use the whole can of anchovies more like 3/4 of the can. I'm thinking of using paste next time. Awesome recipe!!",
