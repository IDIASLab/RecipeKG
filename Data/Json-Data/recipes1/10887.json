Tonight my husband asked if I could make them for dinner - I always use italian style bread crumbs and just eyeball extra seasonings like garlic powder, cracked black pepper, dried parsley and italian seasoning. I sometimes add a bit of rosemary and grated parmesan depending on the side dishes I plan to serve. I never use lemon pepper but tried the dill weed and thought it was pretty good.  I always dip my pork chops into the egg/milk mixture then the seasoned bread crumbs and then repeat that procedure (double dipping).  This gives the pork a thick breading and keeps it moist while baking.  Spray the bottom of a glass baking dish with Pam, place the breaded pork in (no water needed) then spray the pork with a little Pam, cook at 350 for 20 minutes, turn and cook for another 25 minutes.  They'll come out moist and tender.",

I was afraid they would not get crispy just being baked and worried about how soggy the water would make them. I scaled the recipe back to 2 and still had enough breading mix for at least four chops. It really makes way to much breading mixture. I didn't find the dill or Italian seasoning too strong. I however used plain rather than seasoned bread crumbs because that was all I had. I will make again for sure.",
