This is  what I found out: 1) I can't improve it. 2) The capers are a nice touch. 3) I've tried it with and without the egg and cannot     tell the difference.  And since simpler is better in     my kitchen, I usually leave it out. 4) I think salmon has an affinity for dill, so I sub     dill relish for the sweet relish with salmon.     Delicious that way, too.      Many thanks, Diane.",
