I made the recipe for my kids while they were growing up & they still love it. Sweet relish and eggs round out the flavor of bologna in this simple but delicious spread. Serve it on cocktail toast, or use it in sandwiches. The amount of egg, creamy salad dressing and relish should be adjusted to taste.",

If my dad and I are visiting at the same time, you'll always find one of us sneaking to the kitchen to get a bit of it.  I've tried to duplicate it but still have never gotten it right.  She uses Miracle Whip thinned with a teeny bit of milk, and just chops up sweet pickles while processing the bologna and eggs.  I have a container of it in my fridge right now.  This may sound strange, but the best way to eat this in a sandwich is with a few potato chips right in there with the bologna salad.",

Use a ring bologna that isn't pickled. I use mayo and mix half with sweet relish and the other half with dill. I don't bother with the eggs. That's too much. Sandwich spread should be simple. Just the three ingredients and it's perfect! Slice eggs on your individual sandwich with mustard but you wouldn't put bologna on an egg salad sandwich would you? : )",

Grandma used to make this with Canadian bologna (there's nothing like Canadian bologna, I've never found anything like it here in the States), her own chicken's eggs,  Best Foods mayo and her own homemade hot pickles. She also added a couple shakes of pepper. I make it pretty much the same way only with the store deli bologna and zesty pickles. I really like it spread on saltines but it's pretty much good on anything. It's really simple to make and it stretches quite well for those on a budget but need cold lunches during the week.",

For us there was too much relish - it almost added a bitter edge to the flavor even without using an entire cup. We also didn't use anywhere near 16 ounces of salad dressing probably less that half that amount and we still found it a little too much. This seemed to leave a bad aftertaste as well. This isn't horrible but if this were on a buffet table it's the kind of thing you'd try on a cracker and think \"well that was kind of funky\" and then you'd move on to the thousand other things that taste better than this. Sorry but this is one that I just can't recommend.",
