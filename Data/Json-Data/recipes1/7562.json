I added vanilla to the recipe and iced it with a frosting made with more orange zest, the squeezed orange juice and powdered sugar - I definately recommend doing that for a zesty citrus flavour.  I would make sure you allow the rice to cool properly before you add it to the creamed butter and sugar.  It tastes a little like a rice pudding rather than a real cake since there are still whole grains of rice.  So the texture is different but it has a delicious flavour and I will definately make this again.  I may also try doing this with  apple & cinnamon instead of orange.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

I leave out the raisins, add a tsp of real vanilla to the rice while cooking, and use lemon zest instead of orange. I bake it in my fancy bundt pan although the cake I had in Italy was in a flat rectangular pan. I serve it with Lemon Butter from this site.   Thank you Lois!",

I increased the orange zest to 3tbsp - delicious orange flavour. Nice crisp crust. I might play around with this recipe - for instance use less milk maybe one or two eggs less and add some flour and baking powder to make it less pudding-like in the centre. However having said that it turned out of the baking pan very well held its shape nicely. It tastes great but I don't think it's something I'd serve to company - I'd feel like I had to explain that \"yes it is cooked properly try it you'll like it\".",

But lucky me the rice was ok. I think I cooked it to long because there were a lot grains that were hard. They were not heard when i tested it before it was mixed in. I think it was the length I cooked it. I kept checking it and it just seemed to moist. Kept thinking a cake center was going to appear. I was wrong. Finally took it out. Even with the hard bits of rice it was so yummy and the brown rice did not even tast like brown rice. I will so make this again",
