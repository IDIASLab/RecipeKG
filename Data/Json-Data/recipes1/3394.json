Threw in some sauteed asparagus chopped into bite-sized pieces we needed to use up. Added a handful or so of grated chedder/jack mix.",

Gave it a sort of \"potato wedges\" flavor and more depth. It needed it. Gave it like this to husband for lunch.

I couldn't see how 3T of potato flakes could thicken that much liquid in addition to the cooking liquid. So I only added 2 cups of milk. It was still really thin so I thickened it with flour. After tasting I added some chicken bouillion and then 5 slices of Am. cheese. It was then OK but nothing special. The bacon flavor wasn't very prominent...and the bacon pieces were chewy. If I made it again I would save the bacon to crumble on top. And the T of butter didn't add anything but calories IMHO.",
