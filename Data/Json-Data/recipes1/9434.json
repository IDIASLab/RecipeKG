Wow!\"  I think that the earlier reviewers who found this recipe \"bland\" must have done something wrong because the chops were SO FULL OF FLAVOR!!  I accidentally added a whole 1 cup of chicken broth, but I would recommend that everyone make this \"mistake\"--it made enough creamy sauce to serve on the side!  Some other changes:  I substituted marsala cooking wine for the sherry, added some dried crushed rosemary to the flour mixture, used dried minced onions instead of onion powder, and ommited the fresh onions (since I didn't have any)--the recipe still turned out wonderfully!  I will DEFINITELY make this again.  Thank you Stacey!!  :-)",

I made it with whole wheat flour since I didn't have white flour. Also added about 1 cup more of the chicken broth only cause I wanted the chops more juicy and wanted to make extra gravy with the left over juices. I also used minced onion since I didn't have onion powder and added dried rosemary to the flour. Added 1t. of tarragon to flour. Also used about an extra T. of dry sherry and an extra T. of fresh rosemary to add to the chops. Served this chops with mashed potatoes and green beans using the extra juices of the chops to make a gravy. Tip always try to eat chops hot cause if you let them get cold they start to get dry.",

I then omitted the salt in the recipe. I also only used about half the oil (I just pour in enough to cover the bottom of my skillet and 4 Tbsp was just way too much).
