I cooked the chicken thoroughly in the pan, removed it, then made the sauce...I didn't simmer them together as I think it would have made the breading very mushy.  We can't wait to have it again!  *UPDATE: As much as we liked the original recipe, we LOVE this version: Skip the whole chicken process and go straight to cooking the veggies and sauce.  After sauce has thickened, toss in a green vegetable (we use broccoli florets, snap peas or asparagus), then a bunch of peeled, raw shrimp.  The shrimp only need a few minutes to cook, and this will keep your green veggie from getting mushy.  Serve over pasta - YUM!",

As others, instead of using cornstarch, I used the leftover flour mixture to thicken the sauce.  Next time I will increase the lemon juice and that will probably bring this recipe up to 5 stars. Definitely, increase the sauce. I added the chicken back into the sauce just before serving.  Served over whole wheat thin spagetti.  I will make this again.",

I pounded the chicken to about 1/2\" thickness and cut it into smaller serving pieces.  (This chicken had huge breasts!)  That way it took just a few minutes on each side for the chicken to cook and the pieces were of a more reasonable size for serving.  I removed the almost-cooked chicken from the pan and returned it once I completed the remainder of the recipe.  I added fresh minced garlic to the mushrooms and onions.  The cornstarch isn't necessary - if you reduce the wine/broth/ lemon juice until it's nearly gone, then swirl in some butter off heat, you'll end up with a smooth, rich, velvety pan sauce.  I served with this with linguine, lightly dressed with butter, olive oil and garlic, and saut\u00e9ed  fresh spinach.",
