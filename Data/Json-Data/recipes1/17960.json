I was craving Summer and happened to find this recipe, and while  I don't have end of season tomatoes yet, this gazpacho turned out incredibly.  If you love to cook, but take satisfaction in the preparation of the dish, then try this recipe.  I had some time on a Saturday afternoon all to myself to create, and chopping the vegetables was a great source of relaxation.  I felt like a character in a movie (have you ever seen Julia & Julia?) while I was preparing this soup.  OK, maybe that's a bit dramatic, but the finished product is DELICIOUS!  Don't be intimidated by the steps, and here is a great tip from the video--to peel tomatoes easily, dip them in a pot of boiling water for a few seconds.  You'll be able to pull the peel off easily before dicing them.  THANKS for a wonderful, fresh, healthy recipe!  I can't wait to share this with my friends.",

Gazpacho can be time consuming to make but John's isn't but 45 minutes and viewing his video to make it makes it all the more easy. Plus his voice is so relaxing to me!;) The only thing I added was a cucumber slice and a dollop of Daisy Sour Cream to the top of each serving. Bon appetit!",

I did not see the 4 tomatoes called for first thing. so I got home and had all the rest of the ingredients but not those. So-what to do??? I followed the rest of the directions and then added 2 cups of low-sodium V8. This soup is amazing. I'm letting it chill now as I write but it already tastes so good I know this is going to be a once-a-weeker for the rest of the summer! and I am doing great things for my body!!! also I didn't strain the blenderized cherry tomatoes. and I used 1/4 of a yellow onion and blenderized that with the cherry tomatoes. I'm coming in with a spoon boys and y'all better get out of the way!!!!",

Also left out the lime as our tomatoes were bright enough without. My son didn't care for the raw onion and my husband and I decided I should dice the onion a lot smaller next time (I used my vitamix to chop the veg). I was however very pleased with the flavor. I think I might go heavier on the cumin and oregano next time just to play up the Spanish influence. I made some biscuits to go with (didn't have time to make bread) and that was dinner. It was delicious. Our cherry tomatoes are candy-sweet and the big yellow tomatoes were very mild and relatively low acid. So this ended up on the sweet end of the spectrum which really suited me very well. I think it will be even better tomorrow.",

I also couldn't get past the blended/pureed tomatoes, it didn't look appealing at all. My kids and wife tried it and didn't like it either. I was a bit disappointed, perhaps I should be more disappointed with the lack of fresh/flavorful produce in my area.",
