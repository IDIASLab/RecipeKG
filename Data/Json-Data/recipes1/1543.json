You can use any type of dried fruit to equal 6 cups total that you like ie light/dark raisins chopped dried apricots dried cherries cranberries currants etc 2. Add 1 extra cup butter. Use a mix of sugars ie white brown and splenda to equal 2 cups. 3. Add some cinnamon/nutmeg to enhance flavor 4. Finally and this is the key set the timer in 1 hour increments so it does not over bake as baking time of 3 hours will probably overbake and dry it out. 5. For those who like this you can add a couple of tablespoons rum every few days til Christmas and this also makes it moist and tasty.",
