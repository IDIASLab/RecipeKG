I wish however I had made my own pie crust - I really did not like the sweetness of the pastry with the salty goat cheese (I would actually give the recipe 3.5 stars because of this). If I were to make this again I would add a little extra-sharp Cheddar to the cream and egg yolks. This is a good basic recipe that can easily be tweaked to personal preference.",

I used heavy cream instead of heavy whipping cream (it's all i had) and it worked fine. Added thyme sage rosemary and a little grated cheddar to the custard. I used to recipe \"Easy to remember pie crust\" from this website. I didn't measure the goat cheese but i probably doubled it to be nice and cheesy. I would give 5 stars if it weren't for the instruction to leave the onion quartered. That just seems difficult to eat.",
