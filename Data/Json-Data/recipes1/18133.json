The recipe doesn't entail how much of this recipe to use per pounds of meat. It doesn't say if you are to simply season the top of the meat or mix it into the meat. Generally, 1/4 lb of meat is the typical size for a meat patty. So I changed the serving size to 4 on here. Then mixed it a lb of meat.   2.) It was a little too salty for my taste. Next time, I will substitute regular salt for the kosher salt. If it's still too salty, I will drop the salt altogether and only use the celery salt.",
