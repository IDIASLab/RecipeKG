I used sugarfree chocolate fudge pudding 1% milk and Fat Free Cool Whip with great success. I made this cake in a tube pan but found that the last quarter of the cake started to collapse as I sliced it. Think next time I will prepare cake in a 13 x 9 pan slice a layer off of the top to add to the puding mixture and just put the pudding on the top of the cake instead of inside and then cover the pudding with cool whip. Think it will be less messy that way! Highly recommended. A couple of ideas I'm thinking of trying in the future - trying with banana pudding mixed with diced bananas or making a pineapple angel food cake (cake mix 1-16 oz. can crushed pineapple with juice added instead of water adding coconut pudding and topping whipped cream with toasted coconut for a pina colada attempt. Seems like you can have lots of fun with this one!",

I used a store bought cake (which I don't find all that good to begin with too sweet) and Jello-o chocolate-fudge pudding mix that I enriched with additional chocolate. It was very easy to make I'll say that for it. However the angel food cake just doesn't go with a rich pudding mixture - angel food cake is light and airy and goes best with other light ingredients such as fruit and meringue frosting. This is really a mismatched recipe. It might be a little better with a) a homemade AF cake or b) a traditional sponge cake which is slightly richer.",
