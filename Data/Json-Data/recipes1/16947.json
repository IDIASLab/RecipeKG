                "reviewBody": "These are pretty good but take some definite tweaking in both ingredients and execution.  I did try them according to the recipe though. First off, 450F is a very high temp to be roasting carrots for a full 30 mins. They started to burn after 10. I lowered the oven after the first 10 mins to 425F and even then, I had to pull them after 18 minutes.  I wouldn\u2019t go higher than 400F, and I\u2019d also line the pan with parchment.  Second, cinnamon and sugar burn at high temps, so this is another reason to lower the temp. You could smell the sugars burning. Carrots are sweet enough on their own that there is no reason to add more sugar. Third, these also really need some salt to make the flavors pop. In my opinion there is also a lot of oil - you could easily cut it back by half. With these changes they make a lovely side dish with just the right amount of spice.",
