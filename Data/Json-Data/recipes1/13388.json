This made about 14 rolls, but I think that when I do them the next time, I will use less filling in each one.  Then I will be able to roll them more tightly, and they will be appetizer size, instead of meal size.  I used the fish sauce recipe from Vietnamese Fresh Spring Rolls found on this site, and it was the perfect dipping sauce.  My husband loved them, too, which is always a plus!",
