My husband and I love this chicken recipe! We've made it many times over the months and it is super easy requires little effort and is always GOOD! I make three minor modifications to the recipes; I use boneless/skinless chicken thighs or breasts instead of grilling I bake them for 45-60 min at 350 and lastly I have yet to find ginger juice at either of my local grocery stores so I add a tsp of dried ginger spice. It's a GREAT recipe that I know I'll continue to make again and again. Thank you for sharing!",
