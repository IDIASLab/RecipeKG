I sauteed some green pepper onion celery mushrooms and garlic in the drippings from the chicken. Then added the diced chicken to the veggies and sauteed them together for about 2 minutes then added a little salt and pepper to the chicken and veggies. Once I was tossing all those ingredients together I also added some diced pimentos. Tasted very flavorful and cheezy-my son 2 1/2 year old loved it-especially the noodles.",

I love chicken spaghetti but didn't feel like making chicken or cutting up a lot of veggies so I made this instead. I used plain velvetta since that's all I had and dumped in some Ragu spaghetti sauce. It was a great combination of flavors and I'm sure would have tasted great with some chicken and vegetables..had I been in the mood. It was quick and inexpensive so I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks Dianne.",

First I agree with a previous reviewer regarding the noodles-you need more! I used 12oz but next time I'll use 16oz. Also I didn't have cheese whiz so I melted Velveeta and added 1/3 cup salsa to it once it was melted to achieve a close replica of the mexican cheez whiz the submitter had intended. Finally I followed the advice to add some veggies and quick-fry them in the pan I had cooked the chicken (broccoli celery mushrooms) and added a jar of diced pimentos. The result was very good! Would make this again! Thanks Dianne!",
