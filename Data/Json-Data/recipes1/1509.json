I actually made a bunch for a party and used amounts the recipe says to use for 120 servings.  It sounds like alot but it definitely didn't make 120 balls.    I used 1 cup less of confectioners sugar because of the reviews here saying the recipe was too sweet.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the recipe.   One tip is to not use a lot of cinnamon in the bag.  Only put maybe 1-2 Tablespoons in the bag and place about 6 or 8 balls in it and shake.  When I placed all of the recommended cinnamon in the bag the potatoes had too much on them and tasted awful, a mouthful of cinnamon.  ick.    One other tip is to have one hand slightly wet with water---when rolling this keeps the balls moist and allows them to roll up nicely.   Great recipe overall!!",

And these fix up in just minutes. The taste is very sweet - but very good all the same. This recipe is ideal for kids. On note: the recipe says it makes 24 potatoes - yes if you want teeny sized ones. You can easily make larger potatoes if you like - I would say 12 larger size poatoes would be more like it.",

I used a very heaping cup of coconut and a scant cup of powdered sugar. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. The consistentcy came out just perfect like moldable clay. I found that pressing the balls of coconut mixture in the palms of my hands warmed them and made them more smooth and realistic looking. A plastic snack bag made it easy to coat three or four potatoes at a time with the cinnamon. They really look like little potatoes! And they taste like yummy coconut macaroons. I'm adding a photo of my happy results. Five stars for fun easy delicious and no baking.",
