I added all the ingredients but did a small chop. I even sliced the pre-sliced mushrooms even further. The calories seemed kind of high so I used lite mayo and Italian dressing and reduced fat cheese. The green olives do though have a very prominent taste. Anyone who does not like olives would not care for that. The Italian dressing I felt also made it a little tart. For the chicken in a can which I don't care for I boiled 1 lb of chicken tenderloins in some broth and chopped it small and it worked fine.",
