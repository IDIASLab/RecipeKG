I used a whole can of coconut milk rather than half and added sesame oil, fresh ginger, jalapeno pepper, fresh lime juice and cilantro, which turned good into extraordinary!!  Also, I did not put it in the oven. I browned the chicken really well (I used thighs and breasts)and then removed it from skillet to saute the vegetables. I added the chicken back with the vegetables and coconut milk and finished cooking it on top of the stove. I think I would cut the chicken in bite sized pieces the next time.  Serve over rice. Yummy!!",

I also read the other reviews and changed just a bit -- I sauted minced garlic in canola oil before adding the chicken to the pan - I also used red and orange peppers (out of green!) so this was great color! I also added crushed pineapple to the mix (when adding the coconut milk) and it was a great compliment to the coconut! After the chicken and sauce cooked in the oven I added sliced almonds to the top of the dish - they browned as the mixture cooked and it was a great added touch! I also used Lawry's seasoning salt on the chicken as it cooked - it seemed to need a little salt for our taste! Overall - a really great change of pace! I served it over jasmine rice (sticky rice as the kids call it!) Forgot to mention - we only used about 1/4 cup chopped onion - and the pineapple I added was about 1/2 can crushed pineapple. No pepper flakes for this crew!",

So I used to coconut milk as I would when preparing a Thai curry...use half to start and add the last half at right before its done. That being said the recipe was still a little bit bland for me. Based on other suggestions I ended up adding some lime juice and cilantro to punch it up a little. That made the flavors a but more complex but I was still hoping for something more.",

I marinated put black and red pepper and garlic powder on each chicken breast then covered with 1 can of lite coconut milk for several hours.(next time I would cut the chicken up first instead of leaving the breast whole) browned the chicken then cut up into pieces- in another skillet I sauted green chiles and finely chopped ginger along with the onions and peppers.Then added brocolli and baby corn. once the chicken was browned I added the saute from the other skillet and added another can of lite coconut milk and about 1/2 c. pineapple juice.Added chopped cilantro and more red pepper (we like our food spicy!) let everything simmer for about 20 minutes.added cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit served over jasmine rice and topped with sliced almonds- it was a perfect sweet and spicy combination!",
