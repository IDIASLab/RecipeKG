The cookies turned out light and crispy like shortbread, and the frosting was just the right amount of chocolate and just the right amount of sweetness.  I did need to add an additional 1 TBSP of hot water to the frosting mix in order for it to get to the desired consistency, and I needed to bake the cookies an additional 5 - 8 minutes in order for them to get the golden brown edges.  My 3 1/2 year old daughter helped with almost every step of the recipe, and we had a great time together.  These are light, delicious cookies that I'll be proud to present as the dessert for my brother-in-law's birthday.  Thanks for sharing!",
