Rather than make a whole \"pie\" I made individual \"bites\" by spooning the brownie mix into mini-muffin tins before baking (one pkg brownie mix makes about 30 minis). When they were done I pressed a well into the center of each (while still warm). Topped with the filling and one Junior Mint candy on top of each.(I put the filling into a gallon ziploc bag & cut a bit off the corner so I could \"pipe\" the filling into the brownie cups) Brought them to two parties and received many compliments. Thanks for the recipe",

The only difficult thing is that you can't find a brownie mix that is 13 ounces these days which makes for a really thick \"crust\". Not that my guests minded too much. Next time I will leave out the coffee and see if this is better.",

It wasn't nearly minty enough in my opinion and it was so rich we all could only eat a few bites (there were a lot of plates with half-eaten pieces which I hate to see after that much work). I didn't use the coffee because I didn't have any on hand. I'm not sure if that would have improved the flavor or just made the mint even less noticable. I wouldn't make this pie again. It wasn't awful but I'd rather find another recipe for next time with more mint and less heaviness.",

I placed 1/2 cup of Junior Mints in the freezer to harden them and then cut them in peices to place on top. This pie was really sweet so small peices are plenty.",
