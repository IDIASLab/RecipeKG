I used butter-flavored shortening and it was great! I recommend cutting the strips a bit longer than 4-5 inches I liked the long narrow shells better than fat wide ones. I halved the filling recipe and ended up with a LOT left over. Using 2 sheets of puff pastry dough and strips wound on 4.5 inch dowels of 1/2\" thickness I got 36 cookies. This recipe is a keeper!",

These freeze very well. I usually bake at 425 for 5 minutes then turn it down to 400 for another 10- but that all depends on how thin you can get these rolled out- thinner the better.",

I also suggest letting shells stand over night as it makes them easier to fill. Use a pastery bag (I did not have one when I started and baggies simply do NOT handle the thick filling). I tend to make them very thin and then sift powdered sugar over top. So completely unhealthy and absolutely worth it! Make the dough!!! It is must NOT the same as the premade stuff. It's SO much better with the labor intensive version here really...so much better! ENJOY!",
