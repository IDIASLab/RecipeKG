I am constantly trying to replicate it which is no simple task since I was born and bred in Tennessee and have never had it. This chicken had a pretty good flavor although even though I left one side of the foil open it came out rather greasy. I am only giving 2 stars because it was supposed to be like Popeyes and although my hubby liked it he said it was not like Popeyes. I guess I'll keep trying.",
