Next time I may add two packages of lemon Jell-o to the top of the cake or maybe two packages of lemon pudding to the frosting mixture just to make it even better. I also may experiment with allowing the Jell-o to set a bit before pouring it over the cake so it really can get into the holes instead of just seeping into the cake. In any case we'll be making this a lot- it will be wonderful to lighten things up a bit during our long Alaska winters- and plan to experiment with different flavor combinations. Next up: white cake with strawberry Jell-o on top and cheesecake pudding in the frosting!",

If you are looking for a cake with a \"zing,\" this is not it. It is a very light lemon flavor. I did the bundt cake method. If you do that also, be sure to grease and flour your bundt pan generously. Allow the bundt pan to cool on a cooling rack for no more than 5 minutes, and flip the cake onto your serving platter while it is still hot. Instead of a wooden spoon, I used a drinking straw to make numerous holes all over the top and sides of the cake. Use a hand mixer to make the frosting almost to a pudding consistency. I sprinkled lavender sugar over the top right before serving, which was very pretty. I'm looking forward to trying all the different flavor combos suggested in other reviews.",

I was looking for something easy and different and chose this recipe but was very disappointed. The jello does not saturate the cake and as a result only some bites are lemony and moist. The other bites taste just like a lemon cake mix which reminds me of pine sol. I found the frosting to be bland. I took this cake to a get together at a park and no one said a word about it and I took half of it home. So needless to say this will not make it into my recipe box.",
