The only thing that I added was using the glaze that was called for in Delia Martinez' Glazed Meatloaf.\r\n\r\nFor those who thought the meatloaf was bland, you HAVE to try the Glazed Meatloaf glaze on this meatloaf and you will swear it's awesome! I've shared this recipe with others as well as Delia Martinez' glaze and they've all thrown out their old meatloaf recipes and swear this is the best meatloaf EVER! Just do a search on Glazed Meatloaf on Allrecipes to get her glaze and try this meatloaf with her glaze and see if you don't agree it's AWESOME!\r\n\r\nI took the meatloaf out 10 minutes early, drained off the fat, then put the glaze on and popped back in the oven for the final 10 minutes. I've always loved meatloaf, but this combination was the best! I had a hard time finding grated Romano cheese, so I used grated Parmesan instead. Thank you Mr. Gerry for sharing this fabulous recipe!",

Also I toasted the bread then processed it lightly for breadcrumbs and added a bit of milk to make up the liquids difference. These were SO GOOD I was eating them out of the pan barely managed to get a few dozen (small ones) put up in the freezer. These don't even need sauce but I'm sure they'll be fabulous simmered in a nice marinara alhtough I've been dreaming about them in brown sauce over mashed potatoes....",
