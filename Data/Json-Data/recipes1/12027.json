It has a bit too much lemon juice it s a bit sharp from the garlic (if you use fresh) and I find it needs salt and spices. And as a traditionalist I leave out the peanut butter and use tahini instead. However it s a super starting point! For classic hummus I add cumin paprika a pinch of salt and a bit of cayenne pepper. My favorite is roast garlic hummus- double (or triple!) the amount of garlic and roast it carefully under the broiler first. Also good adding green or black olives roasted red peppers or tabasco and crunch red onion. Give this recipe a chance just be prepared to add your own finishing touches to taste.",

I also added 1/4 teaspoon cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt and a pinch of cayenne. Right before serving I stir in a healthy amount of chopped cilantro. As is the recipe is about 2 stars with changes it bumps it up to a four.",

I think if you ask 50 different cooks you'll get 50 different variations on hummus so I used the chickpea/tofu base and added my lemon juice garlic olive oil paprika cayenne and cumin to taste. Not such a fan of the peanut butter but everything else was great! I think I'll use tofu instead of tahini in my hummus from now on... thanks for the recipe & the great idea!",
