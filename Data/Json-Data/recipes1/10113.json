I used a large can of cream of mushroom soup. 1 can  beef broth, 1 pkg. dry onion/mushroom soup mix, 1/4 cup worstershire, 1/2 cup sherry.  No water necessary.  I mixed 2 tbls. Santa Maria seasoning in with the flour mixture and I browned the beef in butter.  I added 2 boxes a fresh  mushrooms but easily could have used 3. I added the mushrooms 4 hours into cooking time.  Lastly, I added parsly, chives and sour cream 20 minutes before serving.  Absolutely perfect!!!   I used 3 pounds of large cubed beef and about 1 1/2 cups sour cream.  Great flavor and not too salty.",
