I never was a big fan of powdered lemon pepper, so I used one fresh lemon with a double recipe, using fresh french green beans. Like another reviewer, I added sauteed red onion to the recipe.  First of all, I blanched the French green beans in boiling water for 8 minutes, and removed them to a colander... then dumped the pot of water. In the same pot, I sauteed a medium red onion, slivered, in  the butter for about 6 minutes. I added garlic paste (the fresh kind in a tube), along with the zest of the lemon. Sauteed for another 2 minutes and added the juice of the lemon to the pot.  Reduced for a few minutes, then added the green beans to the pot, and sauteed for another few minutes.  Add pepper to taste...no salt needed.",
