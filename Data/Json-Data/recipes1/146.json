I also used semi-sweet chocolate chips and added a 1/2 tsp of salt because I think it brings out the flavor of the other ingredients better. I did add more flour as well because I wanted a taller chewy texture rather than flat and cakey and baked them at 325 degrees. I think the lower temperature made them spread to flat. These were such a huge hit with the changes! I've made these a few times now by request of those who ate them the first time. Definately a 5-star ater the changes. Highly addictive!!!",

I thought the cookies were just a little too sweet so I will decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup. Also..I may try just a little less white chocolate chips so they don't overwhelm the cookie. This is a must try! Oh..note to those who are having problems with the baking..try weighing your flour and try refrigerating your dough for a few hours and then maybe squishing them down a little. Mine came out perfect..more cakelike than chewy which I prefer. Good luck!",

I let them cool on the pan for about 5 minutes then transfered to a wire rack where they didn't stay very long as my hubby and kids quickly gobbled them up!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!
