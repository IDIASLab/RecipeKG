First I would saute the celery by itself for about 4 minutes before adding any other vegetables to the pot(this would ensure that it wouldn't be still crunchy at the end of simmering). I would not add the bacon; cut the 1/4 tsp of white pepper to 1/8th tsp; instead of 5 drops of hot sauce only add 3 and before simmering for 20 minutes add 1 1/4 cup of hot water to make it more of a soup/chowder consistency. Without adding the water it would have been way to thick and chuncky for me. Overall my whole family was impressed. Thank you Allana for a nice recipe.",
