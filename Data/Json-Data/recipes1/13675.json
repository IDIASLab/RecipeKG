I think I got the biggest compliment last week about it too...my boyfriend and I went out to eat at a local, well-known Mexican restaurant.  He ordered the enchiladas....as he pushed his half finished plate away he told me \"your enchiladas are better\"!\n\nI have made a few modifications to the recipe to suit my tastes.  Instead of the cream of chicken soup, I use Campbells Nacho Cheese or Southwestern Cheese soup.  I add a jar of medium or mild green chile salsa to the sour cream/soup mixture for texture and spice.  Instead of chopping the chicken for the filling, I shred it and add a few tablespoons of the sour cream/soup mixture to moisten the filling, otherwise it tends to be a bit dry to me.",

For my \"picky\" child I just put aside some chicken, (no onion or chiles) mixed with sauce, used cheddar and put hers on one side of the dish.  She loved it.  \r\nJust a few tips for those making this for the first time.\r\n1. Don't start this from scratch, if like me, you get home at 5:15 unless your family likes to eat late.  Next time I will have the chicken cooked and chopped ahead of time.\r\n2. Double the sauce.  It's worth it.\r\n3. SPRAY the baking dish with PAM.\r\n4. Wrap tortillas in foil and put in oven for a few minutes.  They are much easier to wrap. \r\nTry this recipe.  It is very good.",

Mine turned out wonderfully...with all of my alterations, but thought I'd share them with you.  I mixed 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1 can cream of mushroom soup and added the 4 oz can of green chilies to this mixture.  I sliced and sauteed 8 boneless/skinless chicken thighs with 1-2 tsp cumin and 1 tsp chili and 3 garlic cloves.  Then to assemble...lay out your 8 inch tortilla, put 2 tbsp soup mixture, a tbsp of cottage cheese, a big handful of fresh spinach, some chicken and top with a bit more soup mixture.  Roll it up and place in a 9 x 12 pan that you've added some of the soup mixture in the bottom of to avoid sticking.  Repeat - this quantity made 6 tortillas with a bit of chicken left over which I chopped and added to the top.  Cover it with cheddar, bake for one hour at 325.  Remove foil for last 10 minutes and allow to rest for 10 minutes before dishing up.  I prepared this for family - and it was a huge hit.  Thanks for inspiring me.",
