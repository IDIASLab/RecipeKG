Instead, I formed the dough into two long, skinny ropes, cut slashes in the top, and baked them in the oven. The only other change I made was to cut the salt and pepper back to 1/2 tsp. The bread came out very delicious this way...the only other change I would consider is maybe soaking the oat bran in some of the water for 1/2 hour before mixing up the dough so that it would be softer. Thanks so much for sharing...this recipe is a keeper!",
