It was done in 50 minutes, and came out of the pan perfectly.  I glazed it with warmed (microwaved) cream cheese packaged icing, then topped it with coconut flakes.   Yummy!",

The one seasoned baker said the cake needed soda. Why did the majority of the cakes turn out perfectly (mine included)? Did they use buttermilk that was lowfat? Coconut not mixed in well? (I added mine to the flour mixture). Sugar and butter not mixed long enough??? According to my friend and my family it came out moist and wonderful. Anyone have an idea?",

It was very packy and like others the top cooked first and it was hard to get out of the pan and had this greasy texture to it. After searching high and low for a coconut cake and consulting with other baking friends I think that baking soda is what is missing. Will try again in the future.",

Another thing you really do need to grease your pan(s) well. One of my layers came apart so I did some restructuring. The pan that I greased really well came out perfectly.
