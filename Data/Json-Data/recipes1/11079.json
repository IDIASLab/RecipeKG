The biscotti is crunchy on the outside and yet somewhat tender on the inside. I really like the texture. My husband who doesn't like sweets really like this due to the level of sweetness which is a bit less than what one would think based on the sugar. My granddaughters also liked this very much.

I like mine with just a little softness to them.... not as messy that way! Next time (and there will be a next time) I'm going to try adding almond extract as mentioned in one review.
