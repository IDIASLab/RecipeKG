I was tempted to use bacon instead of prosciutto but that would not have been as good. The bacon would have over powered the scallop. Then I marinated the scallops in bottled italian salad dressing for about a half hour. I was worred about them sticking to the grill so I put the marinated prosciutto wrapped scallops on metal skewers and then put the skewers on a special shish kabob metal holder that lays on the top of the grill surface. This keeps the skewer off of the grill surface. I continued to baste them during the cooking time with the salad dressing. I grilled them for about 20 minutes. (the scallops were large and partially frozen) They were GREAT very light actually. I can understand why some reviewers felt they were a little on the salty side but that is the taste of the prosciutto. I did not feel the taste as over powering. I served them with saffron rice that I had made previously and frozen (from this site) and it was a great easy summer meal. This would also make a great company dish or last minute meal as one reviewer suggested. Thanks for the recipe and thanks for the suggestions.",
