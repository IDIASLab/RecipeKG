To the salad I used all hulled barley (no rice) 1 sweet onion instead of green doubled the corn (used frozen) and omitted the lettuce. I also added some garbonzo beans chopped cucumber a yellow bell pepper and some tomatoes. Also followed other reviews about the dressing ingredients ratios. The addition of Chipotle sauce and Cumin give this salad a fantastic smoky taste with a kick! Terrific salad...will definitely make again!",
