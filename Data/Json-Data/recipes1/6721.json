If you've never had it it's difficult to explain the taste but I'll try. It's sort of like a pecan pie minus the pecans with a candied vanilla-rum flavor. Complicated right? I further complicate things by adding a pinch of cinnamon nutmeg and ground cloves to the mix. Doing so changes the taste to something closer to a pecan pie without the nuts crossed with a pumpkin pie minus the pumpkin. Also for this recipe be sure to use two deep dish pie crusts (there's going to be a whole lot of bubbling going on in the oven) and also cover your crusts with foil because they will burn easily given the lengthy cook time.",

I did also cover my crusts until the last 15 minutes and they came out nicely browned. My only real complaint is that the presentation of the pie is not too nice.
