I made them as appetizers for a shower, kept them small and put toothpicks in them for easy pick up from a baking pan. I made the recipe with 3# turkey meat (increasing all the other ingredients X3 of course) and made about 55 meatballs.  I spent a lot of time reading MANY of the reviews and this is what I came up with.\nPEOPLE SAID:\nAdd onion soup mix to meat--did that\nBake instead of fry the meat--did that\nCut sugar in 1/2--did that\nCut soy sauce in 1/2--did that\nUse cornstarch instead of flour--did that\nAdd pineapple to sauce--did that (1/2 can fruit)\nwith all the juice added to the water\nAdd red pepper to sauce--did that\nAdd ketchup--Used General Tsao Sauce instead of    ketchup. \nThey turned out great. Made them a day ahead and put them in the oven to warm before serving. The only thing that I think I'll do different (even though people disagreed) is to add some General Tsao's right into the meat as well as to the sauce. I think it would add to the flavor. \n\nHope this condensed version of comments will help keep you from spending a lot of time searching.",
