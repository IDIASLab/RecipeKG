A whisk works better here and when adding the milk and cheese than a spoon. I used at least twice as much cheese as called for and used extra sharp cheese for a great cheesy taste. To compensate for the extra cheese I should have added 1/2 cup more milk to make the final dish creamier. On top I mixed some more grated cheddar with the buttered crumbs and this was probably the best part of the dish. Thanks!",
