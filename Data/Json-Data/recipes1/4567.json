She wanted half vanilla and half chocolate so we started on these. first it took ALL day. Second they were great. the shortbread recipe is perfect. I had the same problems the others here had the vanilla side is too soft and the chocolate is too hard. I think cocoa would remedy this. We also use silicone baking sheets instead of wax paper and this helped a lot. My suggestions are: don't divide the dough exactly in half when you add the chocolate chips you are adding volume so you'll need to separate out a little bit more vanilla so they will come out equal in the end. Don't worry about how they look before you cook them they might not look like perfect pinwheels but cooked they will turn out fine as my picture show.",
