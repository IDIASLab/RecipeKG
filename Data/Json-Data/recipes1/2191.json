It's so light, delicious and addicting, and can go well with basically any cake. I recommend chilling the icing for a couple of hours before spreading it so that it will stay on the cake easier. I garnished my cake with grated coconut to complement the pineapple. It was great! I will definitely be making again! (Just to let you know, this recipe makes a TON of icing.. the leftovers make a wonderful fruit dip!)",

                "reviewBody": "Hi, I am so pleased with this recipe, I have made it five or six times. I suggest you drain the juice from both cans of fruit. Then you can add liquid as you need it. I used a boxed butter cake in a bundt cake pan. I mixed together some sugar and cinnamon, poured in half of my already mixed (accordingto package) cake mix, sprinkled the sugar and cinnamon mix over that, then added the rest of the cake mix. Bake according to directions. You will find there will be plenty of icing left over when using the bundt cake pan. I fill up the center of the cake with it. Anything left over, I eat. This is the best cake I've ever had in my life! Thank you, Glenda. Katherine D (katydid) June 12, 2009 I made this cake again for a church picnic. This time I used the Kentuckey Butter Cake found on this site. However, I think I took too much juice from the crushed pineapple. I made the cake the day before and refrigerated it. This always makes it better, but this time the cake was not as moist and good as on previous occasions when I used a box cake. I'm not blaming the cake, though. I think I will take the advise of other reviewers and refrigerate the icing before putting on the cake. I will let you know how that goes. It's still the best cake in the world. I also prefer the four layers rather than the bundt cake pan. Who wants this wonderful icing on a so-so cake?",

Ambrosia usually has coconut in it and I can imagine coconut would be good on this cake. I used \"real vanilla\" white cake mix and cheesecake pudding mix instead of plain vanilla. The topping was just a little soupy and I had trouble getting it to stay on the sides of the cake (it was fine on the top and between the layers). I think if I had prepared the frosting through the step where the pudding is mixed in and chilled it till it set up a bit before folding in the whipped topping it would have worked out better. Refrigerate the assembled cake overnight for best results.",
