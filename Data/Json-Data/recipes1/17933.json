                "reviewBody": "I love poached eggs, firm white and runny yolk.  The grandkids call them 'Dip Eggs' because they like to dip toast into the runny yolk.   I am giving these 4 stars instead of 5 because the cooking time of 6 minutes is too long, especially if you are going to be re-heating these, as suggested for poached eggs for a crowd.   3 - 4 minutes is usually perfect.  The picture I added to this recipe shows the egg poached for 5 minutes and served immediately, not re-heated,  most of the yolk is fully cooked.  If you use a slotted spoon and gently lift the egg up and give it a little jiggle you will be able to see if the white is fully set while the yolk will still jiggle.  Another tip - if you stir the water in a circular motion and drop the egg into the vortex (center) of the swirling water, the white of the egg will wrap around the yolk and make a pretty little package.  You don't have to use champagne vinegar, any vinegar will do and if you don't have vinegar - that is OK too.  Really fresh eggs are best for poaching so if you are doing poached eggs for a crowd it pays to plan to get very fresh eggs.",
