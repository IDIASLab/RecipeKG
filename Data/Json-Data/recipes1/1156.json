You should have been there to smell the wonderful scent of cookies right out of the oven and see the children's faces!!!  I think these are called martian cookies because of the green flecks, and they are out of this world!!",

Zucchini makes baked goods more moist, and it doesn't have any strong flavor in cookies, cakes or brownies.  (So of course squash-haters will love these cookies!)  I made them with my toddler, and he loved them.  I used whole oats, but put them in the food processor first, since I've found that works best in oatmeal cookie recipes for me.  I measure the oats after processing them.  I also never bake my cookies more than 8-9 minutes, because that is how we like them!  (My husband thinks a brown cookie is burned and I kinda agree.)  Thanks for the great recipe!",
