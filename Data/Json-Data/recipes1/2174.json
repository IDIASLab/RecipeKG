Dark Brown. Heavy and moist. Crumbly. Texture is like cake - almost like fruit cake. Slices fit the lunch meat well. Flavor is \"intergalactic\". I wonder if the \"cakieness\" is because I used: a. whole wheat flour b. a whole packet of yeast 2 1/4 tsp rather than 2. c. Olive Oil d. Due to the ratio of Wheat flour to Rye flour",
