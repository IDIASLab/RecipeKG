Make sure not to leave the butter and marshmallows while melting on the stove because it will burn quickly. Also to press the marshmallow mixture on the pan I used the back of a large measuring metal cup sprayed with pam (this makes for an even 1/2\" - 3/4\" crust). Hubby was not fond of the cocoa powder in the cream cheese filling. Next time I will leave out the cocoa powder. For the cream cheese filling I used Bonnie's fruit dip-halved recipe plus 4 oz. of cream cheese and only 1 cup of confectioner's sugar (it was more than enough and it was all I had). Can't wait to make this for the kids friends...great way to get them to eat their fresh fruits!!!",
