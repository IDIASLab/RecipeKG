This got rave reviews from the family dinner. My mother is picky about her fish and just loved the layers of flavor this marinade added to the fish. I couldn't give it a 5 rating because using cooking sherry is just wrong. There are so many good wines available for 5 and under that nobody should be using sherry any more. If you wouldn't drink it you shouldn't cook with it. Good inspiration recipe though.",
