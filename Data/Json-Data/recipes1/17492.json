                "reviewBody": "Fabulous spin on classic garlic bread! However I must say this is WAY too heavy on the herbs and spices which if made exactly as the recipe states basically ruins the whole thing....and that would be a shame because the concept is wonderful and this really IS good! I kept the amount of butter the same and cut everything in HALF! Just by looking at the amounts you could tell it was overkill. I chose to use minced garlic instead of garlic powder and since I didn't have onion salt I used a mix of onion powder with a little salt. I couldn't find sliced blue cheese so I got crumbled and opted to use sourdough bread which proved to be a winning combination. I think no matter what type of hearty bread you have on hand this is going to be great (especially if you happen to be a fan of blue cheese). This was a great accompaniment to grilled steak and a fresh tossed salad!",

I actually had a smaller French baguette so I did halve all of the spices (using Penzy's 'Spanish Cracked' rosemary onion powder as I didn't have onion salt and adding a dash of salt) but kept the butter as is. Of course the grocery store didn't have sliced blue cheese now that I needed it lol so I used crumbled. That worked out great IMO! This bread really had a great herbacious cheesy flavor. I served this w/ pasta tonight but could totally see serving this with a nice steak dinner or hearty stew. I will definately be making this very often! Thanks for sharing.:)",
