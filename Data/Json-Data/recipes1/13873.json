I'll keep looking because this is a definite keeper. Oh Yeah...I believe the cooking time should read one hour at 350 degrees with a cover the first 30 minutes no cover the last. At least this is how it worked for me. The chicken was sooooo tender and the sauce was just thick enough to make a good gravy. The stuffing was moist with the edges being crispy. A very pleasant texture all around. Thanks so much for sharing.",
