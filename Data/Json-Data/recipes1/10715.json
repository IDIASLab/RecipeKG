Per previous reviews regards the excessiveness of the soy sauce, I reduced the amt to 2 TBLS but next time I'll reduce down to 1. I also added 1 TBLS of honey.  Next time, I also reduce the vinegar to 1/8 cup and add 1/4 cup pineapple juice.  I'm hoping this might taste closer to the sweet&sour sauces I am accustomed to.",
