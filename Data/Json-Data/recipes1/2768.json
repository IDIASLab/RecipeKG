I used exactly the amount of ritz and bread crumbs specified and only 3/4 one stick of butter instead of a whole stick and it was still plenty buttery. I also used clam juice (with a little more than the recipe called for since a few people said it was dry in their reviews) because we had steamed oysters the night before and I didn't have any oyster juice left. I also cooked it at 400 instead of 450 and it was Perfect at thirty minutes. We are thinking about adding sauteed onions next time for more texture. Try this you won't be disappointed!!!",
