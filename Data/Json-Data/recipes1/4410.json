I didn't spread the peanut butter layer alone; I was mixing the icing when we got a call and had to leave the house quickly, when we returned, the icing had hardened in the mixer, so I added the peanut butter directly to it and some light cream to bring it to the right consistency and voila!  I will definitely make this cake many, many times, especially when I eat the last piece!  Try this, you won't be disappointed.",

I've never made a cake where you first cook the butter cocoa and eggs together on the stove so that was interesting. When I was cooking the frosting mixture at the last minute the butter separated out and looked gross and greasy but mixed fine with the powdered sugar. The chocolate frosting is my favorite part! I used Adam's natural peanut butter which seemed to go well because the rest of the cake is so sweet. I used a whole 16 oz. jar! I also used a 16 oz. bag of powdered sugar for the frosting. A good use of my buttermilk that was really needing to be used! Try this recipe it's yummy!",
