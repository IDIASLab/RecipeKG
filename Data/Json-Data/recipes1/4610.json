After reading all of the reviews for this tetrazzini this is what I did and recommend: use any kind of pasta; increase butter amount to 3 tablespoons increase onion to cup increase garlic to two cloves use any comibination of cream soups--I used 1 can mushroom and 1 can chicken add 1 soup can of milk use any type of shredded cheese or shredded cheese blend. I actually put 2 cups of the cheese into the casserole. A deep-sided 13 X 9 baking dish worked perfectly (spray with non-stick coating first). Here is what I did for the topping: after baking the foil-covered dish for 30 minutes I sprinkled the remaining 1 cup of cheese a handful of grated Parmesan and some crumbled buttery crackers over the top. The dish was returned to the oven uncovered for another 10 minutes. What a delight!",

I found some shredded american & chedder cheese at the grocery. Either I've never noticed it before or it is a new product. Either way it was the perfect consistency for this dish. We smoked our turkey this year and it did give this casserole a nice flavor. I followed the recipe with just a few exceptions. I wanted to make extra casseroles to freeze for later but I didn't just double the recipe. I used about 18 oz of spaghetti 6 cups of turkey and a little more chicken broth onion & garlic than what the recipe calls for. I also threw in some sliced mushrooms. I was afraid that my kids would be turned off by the red bell pepper on top so I mixed it in the casserole. Finally I thought it needed something \"crunchy\" on top so I sprinkled some bread crumbs on top of the cheese before baking. Next time I might try Ritz cracker crumbs. I will be making this one again! Thanks!",

Used 1/2 wheel of quesadilla cheese and mixed in 2 slices of individually-wrapped American cheese. On the second night I crumbled six buttery round crackers over the top and baked it covered in foil for 30 mins...just right. This was creamy and delish.
