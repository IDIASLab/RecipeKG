I think her oven was off. I have made this numerious times and NEVER had a problem with the crust. To the reviewer who said they had a problem with the top cracking this happens with most cheescakes that get overbaked. Always watch your cheesecake when there is 5-10 minutes left in the baking process. Cheesecake is done when the center is set (sort of looks like Jello). Overall this recipe is terrific on ease & taste. I don't think KIMAR knows the first thing in baking cheesecakes. It takes a lot of practice. And this one is a great one to start with! I also followed other people's reviews and garnished with chocolate and caramel sauce. I then sliced snickers and placed them around the edge! What a professional look! Thanks so much for this great recipe!",

I wanted a thicker cheesecake so I added an extra package of cream cheese and an extra egg extra 1/4 cup sugar a bit more chopped Snickers bar to compensate. My 9 inch springform had broken during our move a couple months ago so I had to use an 8 inch. It made a very tall but lovely cheesecake. Just had to bake it about 20 minutes longer. Left it in the oven for about 2 hours after I turned it off. Garnished with mini Snickers bars and Praline Sundae Topping from this site. Very delicious and a great dessert for Thanksgiving!",

It seemed rather dry as if there wasn't enough butter in it but I made the mistake of trusting the recipe rather than my own instincts. After only 8 minutes in the oven I began to smell it burning. Indeed my crust was very burnt and had to be thrown out. I found several other cheesecake recipes with graham cracker crusts that used more butter in the crust and didn't bake the crust just refrigerated it until the batter was ready to be poured over it. So I remade the crust using an additional 1 tablespoon of butter and didn't bake the crust just refrigerated it until I was ready to pour the batter in. That seemed to work well. However I was disappointed in this cheesecake. It was rather flat resembling a pie more than a cheesecake. A rather disappointing outcome after having to remake the crust after it burned.",

I added more Snickers to the batter, made a milk chocolate glaze for the top and sprinkled chopped peanuts over that.  I used whipped cream, caramel sauce, and sliced Snickers for a garnish.

We bake it for 50 minutes shut off the oven and cracked the door for ten minutes. Then we cool it on top of the stove covered for an hour before putting it in the fridge. It turned out beautiful.
