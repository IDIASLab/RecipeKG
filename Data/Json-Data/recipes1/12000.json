I had a change of last name..lol\r\nAnyway I have lost my original name and can't get it back if I wanted to, I have tried to get them to give me my account back under my new name but so far no luck!\r\nThe reason I am writing is to let you guys know that this dish IS supposed to be served over white rice and yes by all means cut down on the curry if you like, I use 1 TBLSP.\r\nI am so happy that most people have enjoyed this recipe! If you like something MUCH milder, try Lisa Adams chicken noodle casserole. Another thing about this recipe that I have started doing over time is not adding the crunchy onions until the last 5 minutes of baking time. I will get around to posting more recipes under my new name soon.\r\nThx again and Bon Appetit! 08-25-04\r\n",

Then I cubed 2 pounds of raw chicken and placed it atop. The sauce went next; cover chicken well with sauce, then cover the PAN. I baked this for 30 minutes, then remove cover and added the cheese and onions and baked an additional half hour. I do agree that the onions make it, and I didn't even use the full amount. For our own tastes, I only added 1/2 a teaspoon of Madras curry powder, and it was plenty. BUT DO ADD about 2 Tbsp. fresh squeezed LEMON JUICE to the sauce. It really, really adds to the flavor! (If hesitant, mix a squeeze into a spoonful of the sauce--you'll see :) ) The cayenne is a great addition; I used full amount.",

In the past I'd used breadcrumbs on the cheese as a topping which are good--this is better. I generally don't like cayenne pepper but have to admit it made a big difference in the taste. NOTE: The amount of curry powder to add depends on the brand start with 1 1/2 teas and go up to as much as 2 Tablespoons depending on taste.
