My husband really liked it and we both agree that it is the icing that makes it. I feel that it isn't really moist enough right after the baking process. The cake is predominantly a nut cake and not a date cake. The dates only seem to accent it which isn't unusual as the recipe calls for 2 cups on nuts and only 1 cup of dates. As it stands I have to say that taste is entirely a personal matter and I can only speak for myself. It tastes fine but I prefer a meatier tecture when it comes to a date cake.",
