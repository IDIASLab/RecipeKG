However only serve them to people who are more adventurous eaters- they do not have a typical cookie taste and are somewhat of a cross between peanut butter cookies and snickerdoodle/sugar cookies. If you are interested in making this I would recommend that you make sure the butter and sugar are creamed well. There are no ingredients that cause rising action so you need to incorporate air by creaming the butter and sugar. Do not overbake these cookies- they come out of the oven soft but will hardent up somewhat after cooling.",

These were a little bit of a let down. I just didn't like the combination of tahini and sweetness. I think maybe it's because I really love tahini for it's slightly nutty/chalky taste and this was masked by the sugar. Just a personal preference for me. I'm sure others will actually enjoy the cookie BECAUSE it takes out that strong taste from the tahini.",

The cookies that got less done in the middle had more identifiable tahini flavour so maybe I should have cooked them less/cooler. I also might have left the beater on too long while creaming the butter/sugar/eggs putting too much air in. Might have to try this again next time I've got leftover tahini and see if I get it right the 2nd time",
