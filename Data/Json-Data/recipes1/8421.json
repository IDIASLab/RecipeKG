I like this one because it is easy to lighten it up by using fat free sweetened condensed milk fat free whipped cream and light cream cheese. A tip to others be sure to keep this frozen at all times you are not serving because it thaws quickly!!! And the raspberry puree is wonderful and smooth if you take the time to push it through a sieve to get rid of the seeds. It makes a little more work but it is worth it!",

For the sauce on top I used 1/3 rapsberry jam 1 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp water.",
