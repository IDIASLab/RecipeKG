I also added garlic salt and onion powder although I'm sure it would be just as good without. I also skipped the cucumber draining and just pressed it between two paper towels it was perfect! I let it sit in the refrigerator for two hours before dinner and my DH went crazy over this sauce on the turkey gyro recipe from this site!!",

I followed all the steps for proper drainage and the ingredients BUT I added another TBS of lemon juice I love it's tang and I did add 3TBS of a good olive oil for extra richness and smoothness. It reminded me of the wonderful Tzatziki I have enjoyed on my many vacations on Crete. There is nothing like it to accompany kababs hot off a wood fired grill on a starlit night.
