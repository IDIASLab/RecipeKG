I think getting carrots that are already cleaned and peeled was important for this recipe because that way you know you will have the 2 lbs the recipe called for. That might be why some others had that \"eggy\" taste - mine didn't at all. I used 3/4 cup sugar and that was the perfect amount for me. (I like it sweet!) I also added cinnamon and nutmeg and baked it for an hour based on other reviews. I will be making this all the time now because my two and a half year old daughter who wont even think about eating carrots loved this dish!!",

If you don\u2019t have a food processor that will chop the carrots VERY fine, it\u2019s not worth making this recipe \u2013 it will taste like\u2026boiled carrots. I thought I could \u201cchop\u201d up the boiled carrots with my hand mixer, but it didn\u2019t work too well. The large chunks of carrots didn\u2019t taste good at all. It also didn\u2019t look very appetizing.\r\n2. If you are halving or otherwise modifying the amounts in the recipe, ROUND DOWN on the eggs. I rounded up, and it made the souffl\u00e9 very eggy-tasting and too moist.\r\nOtherwise, GREAT recipe!",

I read the reviews and cut sugar to 3/4 cup and butter to 1/4 cup. He liked it and said it was sweet enough but felt it needed butter. I will definitely make it again but I will use the full 1/2 cup butter, a bit more baking powder since mine didn't rise very much, and cook the carrots a bit longer (I did 1 hr this time) to see if they'll get creamier.
