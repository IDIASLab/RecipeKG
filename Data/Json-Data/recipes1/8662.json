My yeast was fine and it rose OK the first time around but the they didn't rise double the second time around (certainly not in 20 minutes). They also didn't have much spring. The end result had an acceptable taste and texture but most were too small for a hamburger bun. I'd probably cut in thirds and then cut each third into 4 or 5 pieces instead of 6. I raised my oven temperature about 10 degrees but 15 minutes was also insufficient cook time... at 15 minutes the pieces that were dinner-roll size were fine but the bun-size were fairly anemic looking and doughy in the middle.
