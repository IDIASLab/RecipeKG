I grilled mine on the lowest setting(450 degrees on the grill thermometer) because I was worried my muffin pan would burn. It didn't burn at that temp. and the eggs were perfectly cooked in 5 minutes. I made the eggs a few ways! Scrambled with bacon bits and cheese... sunnyside up with cheese and a slice of ham forming a cup... and just regular sunnyside up with cheese. The scrambled eggs bubbled over the edge of the pan for some reason, so I won't do that next time. The ham one was my favorite!",
