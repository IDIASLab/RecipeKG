Do add a ton of spices to your meat when frying it if you have a bland sauce. The corn makes this so yummy! Also, I used ground venison  instead of hamburger (My husbands a hunter) and elbow macaroni. A+ super recipe!",

My recipe was slightly different though so I adjusted this one to match it. Instead of egg noodles I used spaghetti noodles. I added minced shallot and minced garlic while the meat was browning. To the sauce (I used a jar of maranara) and corn I added garlic powder onion powder Italian seasoning dried basil leaves minced rosemary and salt to taste. After the noodles were cooked and drained I put all of them in the bottom of a casserole dish and mixed about half the sauce in with them so they wouldn't stick together. Then I layered 1.5 cups of cheese over the top then spread out the rest of the sauce over the cheese. I baked it at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes. Yummy!",

I use 2 cans of diced tomatoes (drained) and one can of tomato sauce. I let the sausage simmer with the sauce for 10 minutes or until it thickens. The diced tomatoes gives the dish texture and substance that it needs. I also added some fresh garlic. With these changes my husband LOVES this dish and its pretty simple and easy for me. I love those type of dishes.",
