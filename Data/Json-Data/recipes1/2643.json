I halved the recipe and made two 7 1/2\" x 9\" loaves, but the first time I used the temperature and time given in the recipe, resulting in two doughy (but delicious) uncooked loaves. If making two loaves, do 325 degrees for 1 hr 10 mins, they bake perfectly! 3. I can't really make the butter and sugar in the beginning \"cream\" together, there's just too much sugar, (but don't change the sugar amount!) So don't worry if it doesn't look creamy. 4. I used an electric mixer to mix the wet ingredients together, but I hand-mixed the flour into the mixture. Try #2 I used the electric mixer to incorporate the flour, the loaves turned out to be a bit too light and airy for me, like cake. Hand-mixing in the flour created a denser, more bread-like consistency. 5. Making a crumbly topping is a MUST. I took a topping recipe from Zucchini Bread IV from this site, but I modified it just a little bit for two loaves: ~ 1/2 cup packed brown sugar ~ 1/2 cup all-purpose flour ~ 2 or 3 tablespoons butter or margarine ~ 1 teaspoon cinnamon ~ 1/3 cup chopped walnuts or pecans. I microwaved the butter for just a while to make it nice and soft, mixed it  together with a fork until it was cumbly, and spooned it over the loaves before putting it in the oven. This bread is SO good and easy, even for a novice baker like myself!",

My changes for half the recipe: 2 TBS butter & 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of all butter. In the batter I used 1 c Splenda and 1/2 c sugar. I used 1 c whole wheat flour and 1 1/4 c all purpose flour.  I used 2 eggs and light sour cream. My 2 loaves baked in an hour. No one would guess they are lower fat and calorie. They were perfect in taste and texture. Next time I'm going to try all Splenda and applesauce and will give an update on the results.",

                "reviewBody": "Yummy!  This is one of the absolutely best banana bread recipes I have ever tried!!!  I had some bananas that were overripe so I decided to make this for my family one morning for breakfast.  I made half of the recipe with 2 eggs and 4 extrmely overripe bananas.  The cinnamon sugar coating was a great touch and I also sprinkled it on top of the bread before baking.  While the bread was cooling, I went to take a shower.  When I got out, everyone was standing around the cooling rack waiting for me to say that it was okay to cut the loaf.:-)  Needless to say, it was well worth the wait.  One thing I did notice was that the loaves did not rise very much.  I know that my baking soda was fresh, so I'm not sure why the bread didn't rise.  I don't know if anyone else experienced this.  ***** just made this again this weekend.  Made half the recipe, and used a long and deep loaf pan (from which you can get slices the size of Starbucks breads). I used 4.5 ripe bananas, 1 cup of sugar, 2 tsp. of vanilla, didn't have sour cream, so I used about 6 ounces of nonfat yogurt, and lots of cinnamon and sugar on the bottom and top of the pan.  I also laid out a row of walnuts down the middle of the loaf pan before baking, and the presentation was very pretty.  I also had to bake it for about 15 minutes more than the time called for in the recipe.  The bread turned out yummy and not too sweet...perfect!!",
