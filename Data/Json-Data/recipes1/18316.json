I got 16 sweet caramelized onion (canned by DH), bacon and cheese rolls. Each ingredient you can taste distinctly. And, goodness you can eat with one hand. These would be great for breakfast. I served with Chicken noodle soup from this site. I am just learning to make breads and rolls using yeast and this recipe turned out fabulous in taste and texture. I will be making these for many meals. I also think it would be easy to tweak. How about cranberries, swiss cheese and toasted or candied walnuts? Yeah, think I'll try that.",

I added some shallots with the onions, then about half way through caramelizing I added some minced fresh rosemary.  I also used more of everything (bacon, cheese, onions) and added some fresh chopped chives for colour and flavour. I didn't have any wine, so I just skipped it...the onions are sweet and I don't think I missed much by leaving it out.  I would emphasize that the onions need at least 20 minutes over medium heat to be perfect...rushing will ruin them. I didn't have smoked cheese, so I used aged cheddar instead.  Flavour and texture was perfect.  The only minor criticism I can think of is that 3T of butter for brushing left me with at least 1T left wasted.   Oh, and I also cut them a bit too large and came out with 8 rolls....but they were cooked at 22 minutes...any smaller and I think they would have been over-done at that time.  Make sure the muffin tin is really well greased...I think I will try just baking them on a tray next time.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be making these again!",

I didn't use the smoked Cheddar cheese, but I will next time---the sharp Cheddar is good, but the smoked would be best!  Port wine, a fortified and thus storable wine, is perfect for these rolls.  I added a tablespoon of flour to my dough but could easily have used one more (it always depends on the atmosphere as to how much flour is needed).  The process of making these is just like making cinnamon rolls.  I would urge you when rolling out the dough to stretch the ball of dough to the length you want it and then roll it out on a well-floured surface from there.  It's hard to start it from a ball and hope to get it into a rectangle because it wants to keep finding its own shape!  I like to leave the rolls just slightly at the golden brown stage so that when I go to heat them in a hot oven without a cover they will brown just a tad more.  My house smelled so wonderful from baking these!  And it was the perfect complement to a ham and bean soup!  Oh, yum!",

The dough was actually very easy to work with- I found I needed to add a few more pinches of flour to keep my hands from sticking so keep your flour stash nearby. At the recommendation of another cook I did not have port wine so I substituted 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and a tablespoon of sugar to make mock wine. It turned out perfectly. If you have any leftover dough from the ends shape it into tiny loaves and bake them along side the rolls. They turn into wonderful mini loaves of bread for sandwiches!",
