He is deployed right now and asked me to send him some oatmeal raisin cookies since they are his favorite.  I made these for him with a few minor changes....I added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp allspice and I used 2 1/2 cups quick oats.  I can tell you that they were delicious right out of the oven, but wasn't sure if they would remain fresh.  My husband called me a week and a half later telling me to stop looking for recipes....this was the best one he ever tasted!  I'm sending him another box of these cookies tomorrow!!!",

Had 2 sticks of \"can't believe it's not butter\" I wanted to use up and wasn't sure about baking with it but it was great. Used all 3 1/2 cups of oats due to the water content of the oleo. added 1 tsp. of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp. more of baking soda to make a softer cookie. 1 tsp. cinnamon butterscotch pudding mix(sugar free) odds and ends of halloween treats...Hershey's kissables reeses peanut peanut butter pieces butterscotch chips and raisins. Did add a tsp. vanilla. Made 58 cookies using the pampered chef small size cookie scoop. Loved the texture. they didn't spread much and puffed up nicely for a really soft cookie chock-full of oats! Thanks for this great recipe with alot of versatility and great flavor.",
