I had to up the temp. to 400 and bake an additional 7 minutes for a total of 17 minutes in the oven. There was WAY too much filling which made it impossible to slice so I had to serve them whole.

I did need an additional 5 minutes baking time and the whole ones were difficult to cut after baking (too gooey and the soft stringiness of the asparagus was hard to cut through) so I would also recommend pre-cutting prior to baking. Wondering if I could do something similar with apples and gouda or figs and brie... Any suggestions?",
