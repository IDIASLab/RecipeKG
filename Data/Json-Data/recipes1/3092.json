I totally hacked the recipe but it's a great base to work from.  I didn't have bourban, so I used apricot preserves and added a little more milk instead, also a tsp of rum flavoring.  I only had one pound of raisins, so I threw in a handful of dried cranberries.  I didn't have dried pineapple at all, so I added dates instead.  The cranberries were *ok* but would probably not use them next time.  They had quite a tart bite.  I'm glad I didn't use a lot.  The only thing wrong with the recipe is I think the \"drop by tsp\" is a typo.  There is no way you could drop this chunky dough by the teaspoon.  I'm using a big cookie dough scoop.  I'm giving it a 5 stars because if this was easy to mess up, I certainly would have done it.  Even with all of the modifications, this came out excellent.  Thanks a bunch.  A great holiday addition to my cookie trays.",

I dropped them by heaped Tablespoons and then formed them into shape because some cookies in the first batch fell apart. I only made half the recipe and got over 90 cookies but the amount you get depends on how much dough you portion for one cookie. I thought they did look pretty - like homemade cookies and the cookies are chock full of fruits & nuts, it can only remind you of fruitcake. Besides, this is a cookie and not a cake. I still am not sure how they are supposed to taste but I am happy with the results.",

                "reviewBody": "These are delicious, and the only cookie I made this year that will NEED to reappear on my cookie tray each holiday season. I do like fruitcake, so maybe I'm biased, but the sweet nutty candied-cherry-and-pineapple dessert makes the holidays and this cookie is even better than the cake. The nuts have that amazing toasted flavor after baking on the sheet, and the cookie size (I did go to about 1.5/2 TBSP dough) is just great for individual portion control. It is also great for people wary of fruitcake: they think, \"Oh I'll take one it's just a couple bites\" and before they know it someone new is hooked. I made the dough exactly as written (well no golden all standard raisins) and see no need to change it. A cup of whiskey seemed like a lot and the raw dough smelled strongly of it: no problems after baking however, just a deeper flavor to the cookie that we find indistinguishable as whiskey. I was also tempted to skip the step of chilling the dough overnight in the fridge, but it can only help the flavors and the chill is important to help the chunky dough stay together. Making the recipe as written I did NOT have issues with crumbling, I did however make sure each drop cookie was nice and compact in the scoop, using my fingers as neccessary to pack the dough. Pretty on the plate and oh-so-easy: don't be afraid of this one! Thanks for sharing :)",

I chopped them to varying degrees and left most of the raisins whole for more interesting texture. I also chopped the nuts.  Finally, I packed the dough together tightly before refrigerating.  In the end the cookies held together quite nicely.  (I let them cool a little before taking them off my baking sheet - that may have helped too...)\n\nI tried various shapes and sizes for the cookie.  It bakes up pretty much exactly as you put it on the baking sheet, so the prettier the shape you put down the prettier the cookie will be.  My favorite was a standard 1.5\" diameter cookie dough scoop.  It was easy and quick to scoop, kept the dough packed together automatically, and made nice rounded ball-shaped cookies.\n\nFinally, I used some standard mixed candied fruit in place of some of the cherries and pineapple just for convenience, and that worked fine.\n\nI think the cookies are amazing, can't stop eating them, and will probably make them every Christmas now.  But at my holiday party no one ranted and raved about them, so I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5.  Of course, this was not a fruitcake-loving crowd...",

                "reviewBody": "I did not care for this recipe at all. The cookies overall had a very plain flavor, and I didn't like the texture of the dough, either.  The dough was way too light and airy to resemble fruitcake very much, and like I said, they tasted very plain to me.  After buying all the expensive ingredients, I was quite disappointed.  Maybe they might be better if the cinnamon and nutmeg were almost doubled, and perhaps add some allspice too.  Also, maybe if you poured some boiling water over the raisins first to plump them up, and then soaked them for a few hours in some bourbon to flavor them up, it might help.  Maybe add some chopped dates and/or prunes too.  But as is, I wouldn't make these again.  Sorry.",
