I only managed about 2 1/2 cups mixed in with the beater. It also seemed to me that I couldn't add all 3 1/2 cups of flour but this may because my starter was less thick than the recipe. I used much less flour and cut the baking soda out entirely. I just think that sourdough bread will always involve a little guesswork and adjustments.",

Sourdough starter will always taste odd if it comes in contact with metal...best to use wooden or plastic utensils and glass or plastic bowls. ( I'm surprised that the recipe didn't advise this.) ok I made this a few days after giving the advice regarding the metal utensils and I have to say this bread was not good at all. It was so heavy and honestly did have a strange aftertaste. We made french toast with it the next day and it didn't get any better. We had to throw out the remainder of the bread.",
