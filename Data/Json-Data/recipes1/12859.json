Next I add 1 egg, 1/2 cup spaghetti sauce, 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, and a cup of breadcrumbs. \r\nThis much stuffing will fill about a dozen medium sized peppers. The recipe's filling is for WAY more than 8 peppers, so it's better to cut it in half. I still clean and boil the pebbers for 5 minutes and once they're stuffed, I put them in a casserole dish and cover them with purchased spaghetti sauce and bake. When done I cover with shredded mozzarella cheese. It's WONDERFUL!",

I added approx. 2 tbs. sugar to the tomatoes.  Also, after baking approx. 40 minutues I covered with shredded mozarella then continued baking.  Before I bake this next time, I'll try cooking the sausage first and delete the grease that accumulates in the dish after baking.  This, of course, will require less baking time.  I'll also add some Italian Seasoning to the tomato sauce mixture.  This is a keeper.",

I don't always have time to read all the reviews.  I am giving this one star because I found, like most, that you only need half the filling that this recipe calls for.  And you do not need to go through the tough work of parboiling the peppers.  Just stuff them raw.  Too many bread crumbs in the filling.  Otherwise, sauce is great.",

I was making these for a trial run before I made them for a family get together and ended up only having to make 1 batch.  Because of the huge amount of peppers I had to make extra of the sauce mixture.  Watch the salt in the sauce 1 1/2 teaspoons does make it taste salty.  I actually ended up using my own sauce to top the peppers with because of how salty it tasted to me, but otherwise they were a hit. I also topped with some grated romano cheese and shredded mozzarella the last 10 mins of baking. I will definitely be making these again.  Also since the recipe made so many peppers I had to freeze some before I could use them for my party.  They froze well.  I was actually thinking of buying more peppers now, while they are on sale, and making another batch and freezing them for later use.",

Make sure to wear GLOVES removing the seeds!! I halved the recipe and used 6 larger sized peppers. I par boiled for 3 minutes before filling. There is wayyy too much filling as many reviewers have stated. For presentation I did not cut the tops off but cut lengthwise and removed a small amount of pepper and seeds. My kids were eating these so I used a country sausage and ground chuck mixture. I subbed onion powder in place of the onion. I will make again since we have a ton of peppers.",
