Yes they tasted a bit like sourdough and they were light enough it was difficult to flip them but we all loved the lightness and the sourdough flavor. In fact my 5 kids thought they tasted so good they didn't want syrup or jam on their pancakes. This is a wonderful bonus...much less sticky!! Now I'm going to go look for a homemade buttermilk mix recipe.",
