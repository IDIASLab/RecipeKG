This will work with any rib: baby back, spareribs, beef ribs, you name it. As far as the root beer and toasted sesame glaze goes, as I sat eating the tender lamb with the sweet, aromatic, nutty sauce, I was a believer. The proper way to eat it is with your fingers.",

I have never made ribs before and as I followed the directions I figured out that you baste cook 5 mins flip them baste cook 5 mins and keep repeating. If you don't keep alternating the side on top the underside looks.. like meat not that nicely browned rib look. I gave this 4 stars because the glaze took 30 mins to reduce. It still never reduced as much as the recipe says. I really enjoyed this recipe and will make it again but next time I'll start reducing the reserved sauce an hour and a half into cook time.",

I thought the sauce was tasty but also greasy and wouldn t really consider the sauce a glaze as although it cooked down it didn't thicken. Turning up the heat to 450 caused a lot of smoke in the oven/house! I ll stick with lamb chops and mint jelly in the long run.",
