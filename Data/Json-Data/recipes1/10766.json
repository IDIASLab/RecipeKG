Make a bechamel sauce with butter flour (I used Wondra) and 1 cup of milk. Add salt and pepper to taste. Layer the tender cabbage bechamel and grated Swiss cheese. Bake until golden on top and bubbly around the sides. Next time we're going to add a little mustard to the bechamel for extra tang. But it's delicious as is. I would have rated this higher but I did make some changes.",
