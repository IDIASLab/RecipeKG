                "reviewBody": "Need clearer directions on folding the dough?\n\nI think I can help.\n\nStart by opening and unrolling the crescent roll dough.  You will have two rectangles of dough that are scored into triangles.\n\nPlace the first rectangle of dough on your cookie sheet so that it is taller than wide.  This will be the base for your yummy fillings.\n\nDivide the second piece of dough along the scored lines to form triangles as if you were rolling them for crescent rolls.\n\nPosition the triangles along the long sides of the rectangle that serves as your base.  You will line them up with the short side of triangle slightly over the dough of the base.  The opposite angle should stick out like a baseball pennant/flag.\n\n(To help you imagine this:  When this is done, your rectangle of dough might look like a saw with teeth coming out of each side.)\n\nThis should yield about 4-6 flags flying off the center base on each side.  Press the dough together to hold.  Line your fillings on the center base rectangle.\n\nNow, fold each triangle into the center, pulling the dough across the filling and slightly down to meet the rectangle base on the opposite side.  Triangles on opposite sides of your base should overlap or criss-cross each other as you fold.\n\n(Visual:  Think of how a corset's straps overlap. Or shoelaces.)\n\nJust like a lattice pie, this will yield a crust that looks braided but is merely overlapped.\n\nWish I could draw you a picture but maybe this will help!  :D",

I skip the cheddar inside but sprinkle some on top a couple minutes before it comes out of the oven and let it melt. When the kids aren't around we add green onion and sweet peppers.  I have also used one crescent sheet rather than rolls.  Roll it out on your cookie sheet, put the cooked egg mix down the middle long ways.  Then make a cut in the exposed dough from the outside edge until you almost hit the eggs.  Repeat every 2 inches.  This creats flaps of dough.  Fold bottom flap up towards the center then alternate from right and left just crossing center.  Ends up looking like a braid.",

One thing to keep in mind - try using frozen (or semi-frozen) crescent roll dough because mine was only refrigerated and it got super sticky and hard to work with. I must say the instructions to do the braid at the top got me kind of confused but I covered it all up and then made a fake criss cross pattern with the leftover dough and it looked fine. Haha. Fake it if it goes wrong!:)",
