Use 3-1/2 Tbs. flour and 1/4 tsp. baking powder, and add a splash of Sherry to these remaining ingredients.  Cook in a combination of butter and oil.  Trust me, the crab cakes will stay together without the breadcrumbs.  Fabulous recipe.",

Too many other recipes use too much Old Bay seasoning or peppers and other extraneous ingredients that take away from the crab flavor. If you like Old Bay seasoning, mix some in mayonnaise, a tinch of ketchup and lemon juice for a nice sauce to serve on the side. Truly wonderful crab cakes! The only improvement could be if I used freshly shelled crab vs. frozen crab meat. Made them for my husband's birthday and he was thrilled, thanking me over and over. Thanks for the recipe! Oh, they are soft when you mold them, but I just plopped a big spoonful right into the crumbs, then patted them together with my hands for a thick crumb coating. Helps if you use more oil to fry.",

It was easy enough to remedy of course but in my view it should have been included. I used finely crushed saltine crackers maybe 1/3 cup just enough to hold those luscious HUGE chunks of lump crabmeat together. I liked the addition of the mustard and I liked the omission of Old Bay Seasoning so common in other crab cake recipes even better. In my opinion it only detracts from the taste of very expensive lump crab. I added a tablespoon of melted butter to the crab mixture for extra richness. I packed the crab cakes firmly before coating them in Japanese panko bread crumbs. I did not use high heat. I wanted to be sure the crab cakes were cooked and heated through before the crumb coating became too dark. Medium to medium-high heat worked well. These were awesome. Big chunks of crab little filler minimal additions and seasonings make all the difference in the world for perfect crab cakes. To complement and garnish them I plated them with \"Avocado-Mango Salsa \" and \"Mustard Cream Sauce \" recipes also from this site and a few leaves of arugula.",

I thought this would work out well since several members commented on the patties not wanting to stay together. I also added the Old Bay seasoning like others suggested. I didnt have any problems with the patties not staying together but I just didn't like the taste of these at all. I want a recipe that has some sort of stuffing inside.
