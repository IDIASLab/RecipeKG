I used 2 c. of berries... also I drained the juice from the can of pineapple and added water to it to make one cup of liquid. I figured that would compensate for the liquid that would have been in the canned blueberries. Oh, also, I didn't put the cream cheese, sour cream mixture on the jello... I just served it in a dish beside the jello as a topping. That way people could use as much or as little as they wanted. I will definitely make this recipe again... really great flavor!",

In reading the other reviews -I would add the following: I made this in a 2 quart jello mold as the recipe called and it umolded perfectly and looked gorgeous. If I made this again I probably would not add the cream cheese topping. Although it worked out fine and tasted great it just wasn't necessary and would sure save a lot of calories without it. Lastly canned blueberries are a fortune. I would find away around those next time. This recipe is a true keeper. Thank you.",
