She alternated using a pre-made graham cracker or Oreo cookie crust based on what was on sale. Lastly her pie was garnished with walnuts or pecans. Again which depended on what she had on hand. She told us it was quick and easy to make but never shared her recipe. I came looking for a recipe to replicate her pie. This tastes just the same. I add nuts before freezing as a garnish and sometimes will mix then into the filling. The kids like the Oreo version best. I garnish with Oreo cookie crumbs. It makes a great nut free option. The pie tastes great and is always one of the first desserts to go when served. Love it.",
