The one thing everyone must do that is not included in the recipe is to fully cook the potatoes before baking them in the casserole.  The 1st time I did not even cook them at all and the 2nd almost halfway and I still had raw potatoes.  I microwaved them the rest of the way to save time.  If cooked properly this recipe has a full rich flavor and is very filling as a main vegetarian dish. I am going to make for the third time with fully cooked potatoes.",

I've found that this works best for me: Peel 3 pounds potatoes and cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes. Boil for 8 minutes and then add a whole bag of frozen broccoli. Cook for a minute or so until the broccoli has thawed. Drain and return to the pot. In a bowl stir together 1 can condensed cheddar cheese soup 1 can cream of broccoli cheese soup 1 C light or fat free sour cream 1 t mustard 1 t garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste. Carefully stir the soup mixture into the potatoes and broccoli making sure not to turn it into mashed potatoes! Spoon into a greased baking dish and bake at 325 for 20-30 minutes. I skip the cheddar cheese since the sauce already has cheese and we don't care for cracker crumbs so I leave them out. Hope this helps someone!",
