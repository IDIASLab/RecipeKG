It was amazingly easy and I didn't have the last minute \"rush\" to get it on the table. I used a sirloin bottom round roast - 10 lbs. - came out tender & tasty. My family rates my new recipes as to weather they would want it for their birthday dinner or not - everyone agreed it was worth a birthday dinner!! I served it with another of your recipes...Mashed potatoes with corn & spinich also a hit - very delicious!! thank you for the recipes.",

While I still didn't consider it to be as tender as I would've liked it's ok if you slice it thinly. The combination of flavors is different and wonderful with a pile of mashed potatoes drenched in the gravy on the side. I also had to thicken the gravy up somewhat (I used 1/3 c. flour; cornstarch would be fine too) otherwise it would've been like soup on the plate. I think this actually had a better flavor the second night I served it (we always have leftovers now that our son is off at college!); the cider vinegar had less of a \"bite\" to it. I cooked it to 170 degrees which was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe that's different from all of those mushroom or onion soup ones!",

I was really not excited that I had bought such a lean roast because it was sure to be tough. However it actually turned out pretty good sliced thinly. I poked deep holes in the meat before marinating overnight. Also I didn't have apricot preserves or pickling spice so I used orange marmalade & put together as many of the pickling spice ingredients I could find: cinnamon peppercorns allspice coriander bay leaves ginger mustard seeds...guessed on amounts until it smelled pretty good. Used a meat thermometer & cooked to about 175 degrees. I also used cornstarch to thicken the sauce because I'm doing weight watchers right now. Still was good esp. with the marmalade. I'm sure I'll make this again since I bought 3 total roasts! Thanks for the recipe.",
