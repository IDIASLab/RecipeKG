I used a 9\" whole wheat pie shell and based on a previous review stating this was more a side dish beefed it up with 3 eggs and 8 oz. crumbled feta (1 cup). I used fresh parsley dried tarragon and omitted the dill. I did not add any salt because I thought the cheese would be enough but I will probably add a dash next time. My husband can be quite picky when it comes to new foods but he went back for seconds. I served with a greek side salad and grilled chicken apple sausage w/ grainy mustard. This is now one of my favorites for dinner or brunch. Thank YOU!",
