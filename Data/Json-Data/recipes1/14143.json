I didn't cook it for 2 hours, I have a VERY hot oven, so I only cooked it for a little over an hour.  If I had gone 2 hours, it would have been dry.  I also waited 30 minutes, then put the glaze on, to reduce burning. I used Splenda brown sugar blend to reduce calories, and it was great.  Highly recommend this one.",

For everything else I followed the recipe exactly.  The 2 hour baking time threw me at first (since every other recipe I've ever used has been 1 hour) but it was perfect.  It came out moist and delish instead of the charred meatbrick I'd been imagining.  It does have a slightly orange-ish color (from the mustard/ketchup), which I suppose could be somewhat disconcerting for people.",
