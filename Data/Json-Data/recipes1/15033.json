The kids loved them because they are so cute but the adults ended up eating most of them before the kids got to them. I used juju fish and sour worms. I also made some with chocolate pudding. Next time I think I may use some blue food coloring in the vanilla pudding to make the pudding blue so it looks like water!! So cute!!",
