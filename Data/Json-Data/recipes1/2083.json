I used 1/2 cup of honey, and it was a very subtle flavor, I also increased the salt by 1/2 tsp and exchanged one cup of white flour for another of wheat. I had to allow for very long rising times since it's winter - they were a full inch above the pan when I put the in the oven. The result is a beautifully fluffy texture that's full of flavor.  I just made this a second time, and added a 1/2 cup of quick oats. This made for a heartier texture, great for sandwich bread! ",

The only suggestion is to make sure you cook it in a freshly heated oven.  Don't try baking it after cooking something else in a higher temperature.  Even if you reduce the temperature, the oven is still too hot and the outside of the bread cooks faster than the inside, therefore making a doughy inside.  I'm fairly new at bread baking and have found this to be an easy and tasty bread.",

I followed all the directions to the tee.  I made sure to have all my things together so I could move along smoothly.  I used a baby thermometer to make sure my water was 110 degrees.  I know this sounds absurd but I just had a baby and I have at least four new ones sitting around the house.  I was really scared that the water would be too hot or not hot enough.  I waited about two minutes to add the honey.  I added the flour one cup at a time.  It was easy to stir when I added the three cups of wheat flour.  Once I got to the third cup of all purpose flour I started to worry that I was stirring it too much.  So I transferred the mixture to my stand mixer with the dough hook.  I added the last two cups of flour and let it knead for 10 minutes.  I am glad I decided to put the dough in a gigantic plastic bowl to rise instead of leaving it in the mixing bowl because it would not have fit once it rose.  I cut my oven on pre heat and cut it off after two or three minutes.  Just enough to get it warm.  I sutck the dough in to rise.  After punching the dough down I made to loaf shapes and put them in the greased pans.  I needed the oven to begin to pre heat for baking so I put them in the microwave this time.  I didnt cut it on just stuck them in there.  It took 30 minutes for them to rise again.  To my surprise when I took them",

Using this method will keep you from adding more flour than the recipe intends. If you have no way of weighing the flour, lightly spoon the flour into the measuring cup & gently level without compressing the flour. Also, don't feel you must use all the flour the recipe calls for. Once it has a soft consistency & has lost the tacky feel, you've probably added all the flour you need.",

It needs to be 3 1/2 cups of water.  (Also, the picture at the top is of bread that was allowed to over-rise.  My husband used to be a commercial baker -- he knows his stuff.)",
