I did alter the peanut sauce slightly; I found it a bit too sweet and not peanut butter-y enough for my tastes when made as written, so I added more peanut butter and a bit of Sambal Oelek for heat as well. I would reduce the sugar next time. Other than that, followed the recipe pretty closely. Thank you for the recipe!",
