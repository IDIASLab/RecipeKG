Overall the flavor was good though especially considering I was out of honey so I didn't really sweeten it at all. I would love to try it again doubling the recipe but for my first attempt I was disappointed that it didn't yield more. The second and 3rd times I made this I was out of honey so I substituted with molasses. Honestly I prefer it this way! It makes the loaf taste more \"rustic\" sweet and less \"sticky\" sweet. Also doubling the recipe worked a lot better -- we had enough for my family of 4. Its a really good easy base recipe but I have had to play with it to get it the way I like it.",
