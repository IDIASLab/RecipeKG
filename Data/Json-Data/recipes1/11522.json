This is an excellent, not-too-hard shrimp appetizer that's perfect for special occasions. It's best served at room temperature. I used approximately 1 pound of 30-40 count shrimp.  But any medium to large size shrimp will do.  You need approximately 30 shrimp. The shrimp and sauce may be cooked in advance and chilled.",

I grilled thick slices of pineapple which worked out well. Instead of coating the shrimp with the sauce I thought I'd use it as a dipping sauce. When warm it was a great consistency but after being chilled it was just a little too thick and the butter did try and seperate out. Instead of using curry powder I used 1 tsp of red curry paste and that worked well. Next time I would probably reduce the butter and flour down to 2 T butter and 1 T flour in order thicken it less vs. the stick of butter and 1/4 cup of flour that the recipe calls for.",

I added garlic ginger and crushed red peppers and that helped. I would agree that I wouldn't add as much butter and flour next time to make it less thick. I would try this recipe again as I think the base of it is good for a simple curry sauce.. Maybe with the shrimp it has a much better affect.",
