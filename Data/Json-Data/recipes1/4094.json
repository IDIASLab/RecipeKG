                "reviewBody": "This recipe is so quick and easy but that does not prevent this from being a very very tasty dish. I make only a few inexpensive modifications that result in an improved final product. 1. Instead of Starkist or Chicken of the Sea tuna splurge on any brand of Tonno tuna. Tonno is yellowfin tuna canned in olive oil and it is found in the same aisle as regular tuna. Yes it is more expensive but it is usually only about 1.50- 1.80 a can and the taste is WELL worth the extra money. After you eat tonno you will never ever want to eat any other canned tuna. For best results don't drain the oil off when you open the can; instead flake the tuna and the oil together in a bowl before adding to the pasta. 2. Toast the pine nuts for about 4 minutes and add them just before serving. Toasting really enhances the flavor of the nuts. 3. If you can use fresh lemon juice and not the bottled juice. I am a huge fan of going the easy route but not here. Bottled lemon juice really does not work so well with this recipe. If I don't have fresh lemons but do have bottled juice I just leave the bottled juice out. That's how much I don't like it in this recipe. But the fresh lemon juice is really a great addition. 4. If you like salt a lot add capers. Use wild capers if you can find them. They are found in the same aisle as regular capers and they cost about 1.50 more per jar but they sure do have an amazing flavor that is perfect here.",

I liked it cold and of course changed it up to what I liked more of which was the olives and I did add capers. I did use the feta cheese and tossed it with red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice and used an Italian blend of herbs instead of just basil because that is what I had. If you make this recipe as is or change it up according to your taste you can't go wrong. It's a great pasta salad.",
