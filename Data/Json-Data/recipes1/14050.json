White chocolate gives a subtle sweetness to these cookies but I think dark chocolate chips (semisweet are OK) best complement the orange flavored cranberries and thus create a bigger wow factor. I use the Ghirardelli cocoa chips - when on sale - which are extra large and also make the cookies slightly larger so that the chocolate isn't overpowering. Time saving tip: Buy packaged orange flavored cranberries. Trader Joe's sells an 8 oz bag for the reasonable price of 2.00 (and the leftover cranberries make a tasty midday snack at work.) Thanks for the great recipe! Not only are they a family favorite but they also make a great gift for the winter holidays.",

I left them in the oven for a little longer maybe more like 15 minutes because they seemed especially gooey. (That may be because I used margarine (ew) instead of butter.) Oh -- I also threw in some flax seed for good measure and a bit of oat cereal that I wanted to get rid of so mine were a bit crunchy but I like that.",
