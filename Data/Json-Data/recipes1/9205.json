With my changes (the same or similar to others) this dish is truly PERFECT! \nFirst, only use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup, with 1 C of sour cream, and 1 C of mayonaise. I added 3 t of curry (I simply can not imagine less) as well, and doubled the lemon juice.\n\nAs for the chicken, I boil then debone an entire chicken, then shred all meat but the breast, which I save for other recipes. \n\nI also add a can of chopped, water chestnuts. If you have not tried this addition, some people say it makes the dish! \n\nPer another user's recommendation, I layered all of this over 4 cups of cooked, white rice. This just puts it over the top, as the rice is more flavorful than if served over the rice cooked separately. \n\nOn top, I do a layer of buttered breadcrumbs with a light coating of Parmesan cheese.\n\nI suppose my recipe looks much different than this original now that I see all of my changes, but I will post this here in hopes it will be a blessing to someone who is wanting to make the most scrumptious dish of broccoli chicken casserole they have ever tasted!",

Also, I don't heat the soup mixture -- just layer shredded chicken, frozen broccoli then the soup/mayo/curry concoction and top with cheese. The whole thing gets thrown in the oven for about an hour until it's all hot and I have time to do homework, etc. while it's cooking. I serve with hot sticky steamed white rice.  One more thing -- low fat cream of chicken soup works great--no taste difference and hopefully a little healthier. :o)",

Firstly you'll get a lot more flavour in the chicken if you bake it or fry it in some olive oil and season it with salt and pepper. Also rather than cooking the sauce beforehand just pour all the ingredients together (once the broccoli and chicken have been pre-cooked) and bake it for 30 to 35 minutes total. Also mix the cheese into the sauce mixture rather than just sprinkling it over the top. If it had been done this way it would have been 5 stars for sure!!",

With a few alterations this is the \"Chicken Divan\" recipe I've been trying to recover for years: Increased curry to 3T and increased the lemon juice to 4T. My \"old\" recipe used two cans (not three) of cream of mushroom soup versus cream of chicken so I used that instead and added one cup of sour cream. Three cans of soup plus the sour cream is just too much liquid but the addition of sour cream is a MUST in my opinion. I did not heat the soup mix prior to baking (and added a handful (about 1/4 cup) of shredded cheddar to the soup mix). Sprinkled remaining cheddar (plus some extra) on the top and then a layer of fine breadcrumbs (1/4 cup) on top of the cheese dotted with butter. This creates a delicious thin \"crust\" on top. Increased cooking time to 30 minutes. Our favorite way to enjoy this is over lightly buttered and salted egg noodles. This is great alternative for those that don't care for rice and you can still enjoy every ounce of the scrumptious sauce!! My husband was thrilled that I found our new Chicken Divan \"standard\" recipe and this will probably be on our table about once a month!",
