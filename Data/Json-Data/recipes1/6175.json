I didn't have enough munster cheese so I mixed in mozzerela cheese too. I then took low sodium cream of chicken soup, diced up 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 cup chicken broth and heated for the gravy. Poured this over the top of the chicken and baked as indicated. It turned out so tender that we didn't need a knife. I will definitely make this again.",

The cream of chicken soup and Muenster cheese go very well with each other.  May I suggest the addition of canned, sliced mushrooms and thinly sliced green onion on top of the Muenster cheese before adding the cream of chicken soup in order to add more taste and color to this wonderful dish.  However, the recipe is excellent as it is. I will definitely make this excellent chicken recipe again.   ",
