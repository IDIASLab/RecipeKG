I tweaked it a bit, due to what I had on hand. I used coconut oil - which was a new experience. Other than it being super solid, and having to beat it down (= for a long time to get it to incorporate, it worked well. And I used chopped pecans, instead of the walnuts. I questioned the \"1/3 tsp\" measure on the baking soda and vanilla - but found one in ONE of my sets of measuring spoons. [I forgot the vanilla, by the way - and it was fine (=] I did roll them into balls and flatten them into patties, after reading sassyoldlady's review. I did 12 as is, then added a heaping 1/3 c chocolate covered craisins for the second half batch. It yielded 23 cookies. But I was picking at the dough [which was so yummy!], and I bet I ate my 24th cookie raw (= I brought them to work to share, and these got RAVE reviews from my coworkers!",

Crunchy on the outside soft and chewy on the inside just like I think oatmeal cookies should be. I thought the order of the listed ingredients and the directions were a mess. Usually the listed ingredients are in the order of the directions not with this one. I tried baking these 2 different ways. Fourteen minutes at 400 would have been too long in my oven. After flattening the cookies just a little they were done at the 9 minute mark at 400. I also tried baking for 11 minutes at 350 without flattening at all. This resulted in my favorite baked cookie. I think this is a great tasting cookie that kept well without losing the crunchiness or softness. Thanks Bryan for sharing your recipe. I think this was a great pick for Recipe Group this week.",

I also used parchment paper instead of greasing a cookie sheet. Perfect! I would have loved to have added the walnuts as I feel that would have put it over the top. I made 24 cookies so they must have been a little smaller than called for. I did notice that I ran the mixer a little longer than I do with other recipes so it was really well mixed. Thank you Bryan for sharing such a YUMMY recipe!! We LOVED it!",

They barely spread and still seemed a little doughy in the middle even though the outsides were crispy. Went up to #40 and flattened them a little they spread to about 3\" cookies. Just about right. A tablespoon is not going to make a very big cookie! I got a dozen regular size cookies after the first two balls. Halfway through I added some craisins to the rest of the batter. 400 at 9 minutes is just right (thanks for the tip bigcountry!)Good flavor nice and crunchy and chewy in all the right spots.

I followed the process and ingredients with the exception of omitting the nuts (allergies) but the baking time and temps were not compatible with my oven. The tbs measure for the cookies was too small at minimum it should be a well rounded tbs and that would still yield a rather small cookie. I used a #40 scoop just shy of 2 oz and got 21 cookies. I realize different ovens may not run true to temperature but 400F at 13 minutes gave me a seriously over cooked very spread cookie. 9 minutes gave me raw centers and almost over done edges and still very spread. 375 was still too hot. I finally settled on 350 for 13 minutes which gave me evenly baked cookies with just a crisp edge and a chewy center. And they didn't spread as much as at the higher temperatures. They do taste good though so thanks for sharing the recipe.",
