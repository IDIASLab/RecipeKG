You can cut the angel food cake in cubes but once you mix it all together it really shredds up and does not resemble cubes at all. I only used 8 oz. of cool whip and it was fine. It is a great low fat/low cal recipe. Sugar free straw. jello fat free cool whip fat free angel food cake yummy dessert.",
