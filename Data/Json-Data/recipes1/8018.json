When I ate it, I did add salt, but I'm a huge salt lover so that's totally a \"to taste\" thing.  For those people who made comments about how this was \"too much corn\"... it's called CORN PUDDING... of course there's a lot of corn!  If you don't like corn, this recipe isn't for you!

When I made it, I discovered at the last second that I had no cornstarch, so I substituted 1/2 cup flour and it still came out great.  I also substituted frozen corn for the canned corn kernels -- just filled up one of the empty creamed corn cans as a measure, and added 1 tsp. salt.  It does make a LOT, however, and is not easy to cut in half since it calls for 5 eggs, so it would be best for a crowd.  Absolutely delicious and addictive; even my son who doesn't eat vegetables had seconds.",

My mom made it for christmas dinner this past week, but used a bowl type casserole and baked it for the full amount of time and it was very very runny.  It looked like it was cooked through until we served it.  Very disappointing the second time, but I will continue making it using my flat dish.",

Thanks to reviewers who offered preparation tips, I mixed the cornstarch easily with the cold milk before adding the butter and sugar.   I melted the butter ahead of time, so I could add it at room temperature.  I also took the eggs out of the frig about an hour earlier so all ingredients would be about the same temp.   I added a pinch or two of ground nutmeg, as an earlier reviewer recommended.  I used the best ingredients I could find, including Green Giant White Shoepeg Corn, which is vacuum packed in the can and crunchy like fresh--with no fluid to drain off.   I substituted one tablespoon of the sugar with dark brown sugar, and baked the pudding in a flat Corning casserole, a rounded rectangle measuring 11 by 9 by 3.    It cooked beautifully---and in 50 minutes!   Looked like the photo, and tasted like my departed grandma's!   Not too sweet, packed with corn, held together with a tender sweet custard!   Awesome!",
