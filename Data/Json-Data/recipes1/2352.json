It was definitely easy to prepare and a kid friendly recipe to get them involved in. Our 5 yr old son loved it but I think it was because he was able to prepare most of the pie and was impressed with how the food coloring turned the mixture green. Next time I will definitely opt for a key lime pie recipe that is baked to help break down the sugar.",

I thought that I had a reasonable expectation that I would be able to get 8 tablespoons of juice out of 30 key limes. I prefer Persian limes believe me. Key limes are a headache. After 40 minutes of cutting seeding and prodding all the juice I could out of the critters I only had 4 tablespoons of juice. I had no other source of juice in the house and time wouldn't permit a trip to the store. So! I decided that I would use some lemon drink powder and water to make up the difference. Well of course the water foiled the effect of the condensed milk and juice combination yielding a watery filling. I decided to add 4 egg yolks and baked it for about 40 minutes at 350. The pie was just great! Since it was for company it was a breath holding experience but turned out nicely. Don't know that I would recommend doing this exactly but just thought I'd share.",

My wife gave it a 6 on a 1 to 10 scale which I thought was just about right. The recipe's major advantage is ease of preparation. It's quick and easy. I prefer \"real\" pie crust but my wife wanted gram cracker crust (If mama ain't happy....). Still it would have been better with the real stuff.",
