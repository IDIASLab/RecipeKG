Only thing they do is garnish it with sprayed whipped cream and cinnamon. Rice pudding really is a formula recipe like baking. Follow this recipe verbatim. I used golden raisins, my preference, and 2% milk as my only minor deviations. Do not use non fat milk, artificial sweeteners, or regular rice, and expect this to turn out thick and creamy. I made sure not to boil it at the end, as stated, so it did not separate. It stayed pudding like with that suggestion. Unless one eats large desserts, I would say this is probably closer to 5 servings. This one is being saved in the recipe box, for future rice pudding cravings. ty",

You must add enough hot mixture to the eggs to bring them up in temp to add to the rest of the pudding or else the eggs cook! The instructions just say \"add a small amount of hot mixture\" and that just doesn't cut it. I would like to spare someone else from the same mistake if possible. I also added a little extra sugar and no raisins and it is amazing. I've made it every day for a week now.",
