If I am going to go through the trouble of making this masterpiece I want it to be spectacular. so I used 5 egg whites. if you've never made anything with stiff egg whites. whip them like crazy. make sure they are stiff peaks, you should be able to turn the bowl upside down with out them so much as moving. The meringue will fail if you do not get the whites whipped correct. I did not have a problem with the filling it was very good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the issue of the egg whites. that was quite confusing in the recipe especially if someone has never made anything like this. These are fun pies to make! good luck and good eating!",
