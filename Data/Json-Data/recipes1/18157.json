I trim the asparagus and marinate it in about 2 tbsp of soy sauce and approximately 4 tbsp of sesame oil along with some finely minced garlic. Then I heat the grill and cook the asparagus. When it's done I pour the marinade over the roasted spears and serve it hot. We all love it. I don't add salt because the soy sauce takes care of that but I do add some freshly ground black pepper.",
