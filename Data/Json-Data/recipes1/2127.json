IF this was a home-made cake that came out TASTING like it was boxed...I would understand the comments but it is what it is...a boxed cake recipe!  Now, my cake stuck as well and I would probably suggest next time (since I am not the only victim) that after 5 minutes--remove cake from pan, place back into the pan, poke & THEN add glaze. Let cake cool.  Cake should be fine after that.  Stuck or not, I will DEFINITELY make this again! This is a nice, lemony, moist cake which is exactly what I want in my Lemon Cakes.  I added fresh lemon zest to my batter.  Please--Don't be put off by these comments about 'boxed taste'. Just be sure to use Brand Name products for best results.  For baking, that should be a habit anyway. Personally, I love & commend fellow bakers who create \"Doctored' Cake mix recipes. They're quick sweet treats for picnics, potlucks or when you want to take THAT recipe a bit further with your own imagination.  I wish we would judge from that perspective.  For the 2/3/2007 review...It takes a lot of 'chutzpah' to rate someone's recipe lower because you (and you ADMIT it) \"were GOING to pass it off as home-made but the taste of the mix and the pudding came through. Hence the 4 stars.\" (unquote) WOW! Let me say that again...WOW! Translation: \"I give it low marks because I CAN'T lie that I made it home-made\". Trust me people...all will be impressed you made a cake mix cake--taste this good. WOW--(again).",

And I'm the girl who eats brown sugar out of the box with a spoon so when I think something's too sweet that's saying something. The cake was definitely well-received - I served it with fresh strawberries like another reviewer on this site - but I think we all felt a little dirty afterward like we'd just eaten a meal composed entirely of Nerds dipped in pre-sweetened Kool-Aid and wrapped in Laffy Taffy. I think that the glaze was really what sent it over-the-top. Concentrated lemonade is already pretty sweet so adding sugar really ups the cavity-factor. If I make it again - which I very well might since I love lemon anything - I might try making a glaze from lemon juice and sugar or just using the lemonade without extra sugar. Still not a bad recipe. (By the way one of the earlier reviewers was right when they said that they could taste the mix here; with all of the pre-prepared foods involved you won't be able to pass this off as a scratch cake. Which is not necessarily a bad thing just something you might want to keep in mind.)",
