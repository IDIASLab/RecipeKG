It tasted more like a pumpkin cheesecake than carrot cake (and not a very good pumpkin cheesecake). I was really looking forward to a flavor more like an actual carrot cake. The crust was very good and the cheesecake was easy to make. I sent the leftovers home with one of my guests. I don't think that I will make this one again.",

                "reviewBody": "Well to say this carrot cheesecake was VERY elegant looking and simply looked the part. The recipe was very easy to do. I didn't do a water bath for it and thought I should because the ingredients were processed in a food processor. It did crack not like I thought it was going to but mainly around the outer edge of the dessert and that wasn't that bad at all. I choose to keep my pecans in halved peices verses chopped. However I followed to a T. Texture wise the cheesecake was right on point with creamy and smoothness. The crust was by far superior with texture and flavor. I'd make the crust again. Because it held it's form when cutting and overall look and the flavor of the crust was really good. However the flavor of the cheesecake was a bit different. I found the zesting of the orange over-powering in flavor as well as the spices. It did taste similar to pumpkin and so it was just not what I expected. I would totally tone down the orange and spice flavor to see if the carrot flavor would shine through. Having said that. I can see changing the carrot to a sweet potato OR pumpkin. I don't want to say it was overly bad but I won't say it was the best either. It was just okay. My husband however said that it wasn't his favorite but was okay. Not something he would totally request me to make again unless I've perfected a great flavor. If you like a faux pumpkin cheesecake then this is for you.",
