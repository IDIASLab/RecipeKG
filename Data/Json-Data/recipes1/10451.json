Other reviews commented negatively about the lime--again, it's a matter of taste. Lime worked for my palette, although the second time around I used lemon and halved the Worcestershire and the fish came out just fine. The great thing about all the recipes you find on this site is that you try them and then make your own subtle changes to suit your tastes if needed. I believe the original is still worth trying. ",

If you travel to costal regions and on many islands lime or lemons are used to clean and flavor fish of all sorts and it does leave a nice flavor. I took half a lime and squeezed it over the fillets then rubbed it over the salmon before placing it in the other ingredients to marinade therefore eliminating the need for the 1/4 cup lime juice.",
