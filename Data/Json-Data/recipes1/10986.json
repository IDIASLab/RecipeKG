It is a very simple and general condiment for lots of things in place of ketchup, mayo or similar condiments.  I have always known and made it as the \"Secret Sauce\" because that's what mom called it. None of our friends knew about it when we moved to CA or elsewhere.  We've converted a lot of people that just can't do plain ketchup any more.  You can tweak the ratio to whatever your preference is...(more mayo, more ketchup or 50/50).  You really can't mess it up.  We've never measured it.  It's great to see someone put this recipe up to share---why didn't I think of it! LOL",
