                "reviewBody": "To avoid wateriness in an old-fashioned apple pie you need to do two things:  Use Cortland or other cooking apples (never use Macintosh!) and add 2 tablespoons of uncooked tapioca right out of the box (more for a 10\" pie).  Spread the first tablespoon over the bottom of the pie crust before you add any apples, then sprinkle the remaining tablespoon throughout the pie.  The tapioca helps absorb the moisture resulting in a perfect pie--don't worry, you can't taste it! :)  You may need to experiment and adjust the amount of tapioca to suit your individual preferences.   This trick was passed down to me by my father whose Swedish grandmother taught it to him as a child... she made the best pies!  Another tip from Nana:  Don't just dump the apples into the pie crust, place them individually in concentric rings.  This takes a LOT longer but your pie will not sink at all--you can have a true \"mile high apple pie\" and you don't  pour in the \"sugar soup\" at the bottom of the mixing bowl that can also contribute to wateriness.  I like my pies a little moist, so I do pour a little of the sugar mixture in, but not all of it.  Also, if you're storing your apples in lemon water to prevent browning between peeling and putting them in the crust, make sure you give them time to drain and shake the colander well to get rid of all the extra water.",

To ensure it was not too liquidy I used 2 heaping tablespoons of flour in my filling mixture. I also added a light sprinkling of cinnamon before laying the top crust down. I over heaped my filling and it did not shirnk much perhaps the apples I used? GALA... made for a sweet yummy pie. I've never made pie before and everyone RAVED over this recipie. I have one of the 3 frozen and can hardly wait to cook it! TIP from my 86 year old Grandmother: Touch the crust as little as possible when it is dough otherwise it will be tough after being cooked. 2nd TIP: Freeze the pie before cooking that way retains it's juicy-ness without becoming soggy once you cook it!",

I most frequently make my apple pies with just white sugar, but this time I wanted a little \u201ccaramel-y-scotchy\u201d taste so I used half white and half brown sugar \u2013just fun for something different.  The amounts of cinnamon and nutmeg were just right.  I typically don\u2019t care for nutmeg in apple pies, but the little bit of it that was indicated here enhanced rather than dominated.  As for the flour, I\u2019m always nervous about that \u2013 2 T. is a common amount used in apple pie recipes but you can never know exactly if that will be too much or too little.  The Fuji apples I used were very juicy so I used two HEAPING tablespoons and so far I\u2019m happy with that.  I\u2019ll be interested to see tomorrow morning, however, once the pie has set overnight, if I\u2019m still as pleased!  I\u2019m hoping it won\u2019t have turned to paste! I used a rich pie crust, \u201cNever, Never Fail Pie Pastry,\u201d also from this site, and brushed it with a mixture of one egg yolk and 1 T. half-and-half before baking.  I baked the pie at a consistent 375 degrees \u2013 25 minutes with the crust uncovered, then another 25 minutes or so with the crust edge covered with foil.  This pie recipe and the pastry recipe I chose was a winning combination and lived up to its name. This was indeed a good \u201cOld Fashioned Apple Pie.\u201d",
