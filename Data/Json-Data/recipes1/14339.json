Don't cut down on the vanilla...this amt. makes the cookie! I used a good Mexican vanilla and it really combined so well with the p.b. They are soft and light with a slight crispy edge. Thanks for the advice regarding not overbaking. They will not look done when you take them out but you can see them brown slightly around the edges right before your eyes as you let them sit on the sheet for a minute or two. Easy to slide right off the sheet without any greasy taste. Lovely cookie but if you have a houseful of cookie monsters you might want to double the batch. This made 54 cookies with the pampered chef small size scoop.",

Cookies will not look finished after 7-8 min but take them out anyway. Suggested add: milk chocolate chunks.",

The reviews previous to mine are all absolutely correct in their assessment of these being the best peanut butter cookies I have ever had! I have been using a family recipe on my husband's side for peanut butter cookies for years and had to admit that I was very nervous to try something new knowing my husband absolutely loves the peanut butter cookies from the old recipe but I threw caution to the wind and BOY am I glad I did! Wow! These cookies have been sitting on the table all day long and they are still soft and fresh!(The old recipe cookies would have been as hard as rocks by now.) I didn't have JIF peanut butter but the peanut butter I did have worked fine. These are truly wonderful cookies and it will replace the old family recipe.:) Thank you so much for sharing this recipe here!",
