In the past month or so I've made about a half dozen chess pies - I simply cannot resist sharing with my less- (or not-at-all-)Southern friends and loved ones.  They've all turned out spot-on perfect.  Rave reviews all around (Southern, Not-so-Southern, Not-at-all Southern friends alike in their compliments!)  Thanks to Clair for sharing!",

That is because it absolutely needs to be baked at 350 for ONE HOUR! not 35 mins. I have a brand new WhirlPool Accubake oven and it works great-so for all the reviewers who said it only takes 35 minutes please tell me what kind of oven you have that baked this pie in 35 minutes so I can run out and buy one! Mine is an electric oven so do you all have gas ovens? Would that make that much of a difference anyway? That is why I gave this recipe 3 stars...After I baked it it came out good but it was very frustrating to have to figure the time out for myself!",
