Perfect cassata cake that is even better than any NYC Italian bakery I have ever tasted because it is not sickly sweet and made with fresh filling rather than bagged pre-made filling. BUT DO NOT use the chocolate glaze for the top...I always use the whipped cream frosting (made with a teaspoon of gelatin) from this website. I have never seen nor have I had Cassata cake with chocolate glaze. The combination of this cake with that frosting is PERFECT!!! =)",

He absolutely loved it. I did make a few substitutions based on the cassata cakes that we have enjoyed in the past. I substituted mini chocolate chips instead of the grated chocolate & I omitted the candied lemon peel. I also left off the chocolate glaze (I have never seen this on a cassata cake) and instead substituted a whipped cream frosting also from this website. I also used a vanilla flavored light rum for the filling. My entire family loved this one I'll definitely make it again.",

I only had one cake pan and one mixer going and made three instead of 2 layers regurdless its very time consuming but very worth it. now the reason i was upset was because the filling is so gewy it does not stay between the layers very well especially since this is a pretty heavy cake. and i was prepared to do some very nice cake decorating but the filling kept oozing out and mixing in with the frosting witch by the way i used cheesecake frosting instead of what this recipe required...and it was a big hit im sure especially because the filling and the cheescake frosting mixed a bit on the outside as well...yumm...also due to the three layers witch i decided to do because two didnt look enough...the cake was tipping a little bit i think if the filling wasnt so slippery and alittle more solid it would have worked better but hey it taste good...sooo...i am definetly going to make this cake again...however i am going to use two layers and make each layer with an extra 1/2 the amount to make them alittle bigger...before i put the filling in im gonna hallow the cake alittle bit so the filling will stay in better...and im still gonna use the cheesecake frosting because is was such a big hit...also im gonna buy another cake pan hahaha...",

                "reviewBody": "The cake was excellent. I made it for a family birthday and everyone wanted seconds even those who aren't fans of ricotta cheese. I followed all instructions as directed for the spongy cake. But made a few variations in the filling and final assembly. Instead of chocolate squares I used mini chips to save time. I also omitted the candied lemon peel and the rum (personal preference). And instead of a chocolate glaze I used a plain whipped cream for the frosting and pressed sliced almonds on the outside. Delicious!",
