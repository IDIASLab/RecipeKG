The vegetables have such a fanstastic flavor - the rice is just there to make it more filling, but it is also highly caloric (and has little nutritional value).  I used about 1/2 a slice of fat-free swiss in each pepper (waaay less than the recipe calls for), threw in a layer of raw mushrooms and onions (they cook themselves nicely in the juices), and topped the peppers with a few tablespoons of crushed tomatoes (healthier AND it lends a simple, delicious tomato flavor) and a tablespoon of fat-free sour cream to each.  For us calorie-counters, this is a genius meal.",

I did some modifying though...I used black beans with chili and cumin spices in it, Hunts tomato sauce with basil, oregano, & garlic, and instant brown rice to save time.  I also used only 1 slice of cheese (halved for layering) per pepper to cut calories.  It turned out wonderful.  A dallop of sour cream on top before serving enhanced the flavor even more.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

We make a few changes (like others have suggested): brown rice instead of white, usually we omit the swiss, and using the crushed tomato (as in another reviewer's comments) really adds the extra flavor needed. I, like the recipe poster, ate this meal with meat as a child, but we're close to vegetarians now. Thanks for this delicious version of a classic! It's highly recommended! Helpful hint: I insert 3 toothpicks into each pepper so they don't fall over while baking.",
