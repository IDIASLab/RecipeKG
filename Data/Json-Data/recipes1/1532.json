Maybe it should have been room temp water? Maybe I should have added it more gradually? The dough is very stiff. \"Folding\" in the beaten egg whites was an amusing activity. I had extra batter. Which was OK since I baked that in a separate little pan & we got to sample that before Easter Dinner:-) I baked it for 45 minutes & even tho the toothpick came out clean it was still raw in the center. Next year we'll go for 60 minutes. To the JOSMITH - think of this as a pound cake. You need such a dense cake to show the details of the lamb from the mold.",
