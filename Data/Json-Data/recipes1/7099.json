I love dipping warm bread into this mixture and it comes very close to the stuff they serve at the famous Italian chain restaurant - Carrabba's. I never put this through a grinder, but rather make a bunch of it (using kosher salt vs. regular and omit the minced garlic) and store it in a small plastic container then add FRESH minced garlic on a plate and pour the olive oil over top. It's a wonderful appetizer that's a definite crowd pleaser - great with wine!",

When I made the recipe I did not grind in grinder I just crushed slightly with a mortar and pestle. I mixed about 1-2 tbs. of this recipe with a stick of butter and chilled for an hour or more. I roasted garlic (cut about 1/4\" of garlic bulb off to expose cloves place garlic in a small piece of tin foil drizzle garlic bulb with about 2 tsp. of olive oil wrap bulb completely with foil bake at 400 degrees for 45 minutes). I placed 3 small serving plates together and put the oil with herbs in one plate the warm roasted garlic in the other plate then the herb butter in the 3rd plate and served it all with slices of french bread. It was awesome!!!! Thank you so much for this recipe.",

I also forgot to put in fresh garlic but it was still good. I have been eatig this for the last 3 nights. Thanks Oh the best part is these are spices that are always in the spice rack. I had to come back and add this in. Icut up some red potatoes and tossed in olive oil and then this spice and roasted and they were wonderfullI had to come back one more time. My neighbor works for carrabas and when i showed him this blend he said looks like what they use but they use fresh herbs. FRESH WOULD BE TO COSTLY AND DOESN'T LAST SO THIS IS A GREAT MIX",
