In the future, I will either lower the oven temperature or start checking for doneness a little sooner.  If I'd set the timer for 12 minutes, they would have been burned.  Oven temps vary, but I'd recommend that you play it safe, and watch your time, at least the first time you make this.  Also, I had a long loaf of bakery french bread which is not large in diameter, so I did have some topping left over (but it'll get used). I had everything prepped, so as soon as the bread came out of the oven, the mushroom mixture was ready...timing worked out perfectly! The lemon really brightens up the flavor, and the marsala enriches the flavor of the mushrooms.  This is a fabulous bruschetta with beautiful eye appeal, and most definitely will be made again.",
