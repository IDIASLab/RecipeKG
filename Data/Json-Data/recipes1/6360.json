In this recipe, it is shredded to resemble a coleslaw, but that is where the resemblance to that creamy classic ends.  This dish is very spicy and full of flavor.  It not only tastes great, but is strangely fun to eat.  If you have chile paste, use 2 teaspoons of that instead of the red pepper flakes.",

I substituted half rice vinegar for the cider vinegar (for a more asian flavor), and added a little sesame oil at the end to give it a nuttier taste. I also added about 3 Tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds for a little nutty interest.\r\n\r\nThe first time I made it, I used the 2 tsp of chile paste (which I love) and I was the only one in my house that could eat it. Too spicy for my husband and kids, but the second go round, I used about half a teaspoon of the chile paste, and while it was a little bland for me, those with more sensitive palates LOVED it.\r\n\r\nMake sure you accomodate the taste buds of those you are cooking for, but with that in mind, we make this regularly.",

I served it with Indonesian Chicken Satay another recipe I found here and got excellent reviews all around. Thanks for a delicious and unusual salad creation!",
