I added the dry ingredients next. The batter was so thick I had to double the sour cream and put it directly into the batter instead of with the berries. Since the batter was so thick, I reduced the berries to 1 cup each instead of 1 1/2 cups. I could not stir in the berries since the batter was sooo thick. I had to use my hands and try to incorporate them. I spooned the batter into the pan and smoothed it out as best as I could. Took 1 hr 15 min to bake. Taste is decent but not worth all the trouble.",
