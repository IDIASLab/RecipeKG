Aspartame has been found to cause brain cancer and other types of cancers. Please try and always use natural sweeteners like honey maple syrup or agave nectar to replace sugar. Agave nectar registers the lowest on the glycemic index chart and it has a very sweet taste so less agave nectar used in recipes give your desserts a sweet taste and it replaces the sugar nicely and the taste is wonderful!!! Thanks for the recipe!",

I decided to try this recipe - and I made a low-fat whole wheat crust myself - and it was pretty good for a sugar-free dessert. I found that it had an odd aftertaste but it was delicious anyway. And my sister thought so too but of course she doesn't have the privilege of indulging often. The only changes I made - aside from making the crust myself - was that I used egg beaters to cut some extra fat. I also used granulated splenda as that's what I have (1 packet of artificial sweetener = 2 tsp granulated splenda) With that and using skim evaporated milk I was able to come up with a pie that totaled about 133 calories 4 grams of fat 8 grams of sugar 18 grams of Carbohydrate and healthy vitamins out the wazoo! I may try another recipe or tinker with this one to see if I can get rid of the aftertaste.",

I'm completely surprised how good this pie is... Because it's no bake there is no real bitterness from the sweetener. I used splenda. After I added the splenda the filling had a tiny bitter after-taste... not too detectable. However once it set the bitterness was gone. Next time I will wait until the filling is at room temp to add the splenda. I used a store bought graham cracker crust... so 1/8 of pie only had 27 carbs total... very satisfying too!! Wonderful!! Thank you so much for the recipe!",
