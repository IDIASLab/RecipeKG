It is a welcome change for those weeks when there doesn't seem to be a lot of variety... and all 3 of my kids even loved it. This can also be cooked in a pan on the stove until the barley and carrot are tender, but I prefer the slow cooker method. The flavors seem to blend better.",

Immediately upon reading this recipe, I knew I had to use more of some of the ingredients ~ I used three carrots, 1/2 cup barley, three cloves of garlic and a tad more Italian seasoning.  I also used hot Italian sausage.  I might take the advice of other reviewers and add a can of diced tomatoes next time too! Another thing...this feeds way more the four people it says.  My large crockpot was overflowing!  That's not a problem, though, because now I have some for the freezer!",

I cooked the soup in the crock pot for 8 hours (overnight) and then put in the fridge to later be heated up when I got home from work. I think it really let the flavors marry. Maybe next time I will try making this with hot Italian sausage (use bulk; easier to cook) and will keep the sausage in bigger pieces. I will definitely be making this one again!",

Unfortunately my soup ended up cooking for 11 hours while I was at work so my only complaint was that the spinach was a little slimy and the veggies and barley were mushy...but it certainly didn't detract from the awesome taste!! As others said it isn't the prettiest soup in the world but it tastes so good that I will definitley make this again (and would for company too!:)",

I used two carrots and a little more barley (1/3 cup) as suggested tossed in some dried basil/oregano/garlic salt (didn't have Italian seasoning on hand) and skipped the spinach as I haven't had luck with keeping spinach non-slimy in soup. It was so good! We heated up the left-overs the next night and it was still just as delicious. The light chicken broth complemented the spicy sausage really well.",

It was good, but I think using Italian sausage as written is more suited for the soup. The carrot and spinach were really good, I used 6oz fresh spinach with no problems. I agree with reviews that you should increase the barley, at least to 1/3c, maybe up to a half. I did make this on the stove to suit my schedule and it worked really well: cook up the sausage/onion/garlic in a soup kettle, add broth and seasoning and bring it to a boil, add barley and cook in the soup according to package directions, about 20 mins before it should be done add in the veggies and finish cooking.
