I get a lot of requests for it and for the recipe. Also instead of the potato flakes and boiling water if you have a cup of left over mashed potatoes that works well too. Instead of mixing the mashed potato flakes with the water I add the water with the wet ingredients and the flakes with the dry. It works well that way.",

I wasn't sure when to add the potato mixture so I added it after the wet ingredients. I only had to let it rise 45 minutes in a warm oven. Wonderful texture and flavor and not too sweet. It smelled so good while baking that I couldn't wait for it to cool to have some so I ate a piece warm with butter on it. Delicious! Tastes a lot like Hawaiian bread.",
