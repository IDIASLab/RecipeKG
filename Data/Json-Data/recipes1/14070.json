I used a deep dish pie crust so had to adjust the baking and temp. 3/4 of the way I reduced the temp to 325 and cooked an additional 20 mins....larger pie takes a little longer to set the middle.

The brown sugar adds such a nice flavour and 1 tbsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice adds the perfect amount of spiciness. I used fresh pumpkin that I had frozen I let it drain overnight in a cheesecloth lined collander. The only thing I changed was the baking temperature pumpkin pies are normally started at 450 for 10 minutes then turned down to 350 for the remainder which was 30 minutes in my oven. #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #FacelessNoMore",
