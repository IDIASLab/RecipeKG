It is a fantastic basic, all-purpose crust that is easy to modify to whatever recipe you need, and simple to double, triple, or augment to fit your particular dish. I have used it for savory pies, dessert pies, and cobblers with little problem.\n\nMy only change is to use milk instead of water, and one can substitute butter or butter-flavored shortening with no problem.  Remember though, if you substitute butter cut the water quantity by about 20% (so from 1/2 cup to 6 tbsp.) because butter contains water and shortening does not.\n\nHappy baking!",

If you plan on making a double crust pie, dont forget to double the recipe like i almost did. a wonderful filling for this pie crust is Apple pie by grandma ople. this was the first time i ever made something big from scratch, and it was EASY AND DELICIOUS! also, dont forget to cut slits in the pie so it dosnt pop or overflow. hope i helped!",

I used it with \"Terry's Favorite Chicken Pie\" (this site) and we couldn't get enough. The only problem was I doubled the recipe to make two pies but only came out with enough for 1 1/2. Will start with 3 cups of flour next time. I used butter flavor Crisco and also added a pinch or two of salt. I wrapped it in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge to cool while I assembled my pie ingredients. The dough is more moist than most pie crust doughs so you will need to roll it out on a good dusting of flour. Thanks Deirdre Dee!! This is the only pie crust recipe I will EVER use!",
