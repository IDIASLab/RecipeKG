I used balsamic vinegar too, didn't peel the eggplants, but DID salt and drain them in a colander an hour before using them. The recipe came out PERFECT, not marinara-ish AT ALL! I served it with toasted pita chips and it was more popular than the regular salsa/chips on the table. EVERYONE raved about it! I will definitely make this again, not only for home enjoyment but for my company's potluck lunches. Easy, elegant, and very yummy. Splurge for pita chips or toast some French or Italian bread and skip the saltines or Ritz crackers.",

I substitute zucchini for the mushrooms, and 1-2 tbl of capers for the olives. Instead of the vinegar sugar combo I followed others suggestion and just use balsamic vinegar to taste-1/4 cup probably. If possible I add fresh herbs instead of dried, and cook it longer than 30 minutes, 45 more likely. Great with fresh soft/crusty bread or over pasta.",

The recipe sounded akin to what she made but I had no idea what it was called. Anyway, instead of using red wine vinegar I used balsamic vinegar, just a personal preference of mine, but I think it really helped to develop the flavor, and I used a 1/4 cup of it. The only other alterations were more garlic, not peeling the eggplant, and I didn't have oregano and basil at hand but I had italian seasonings, so I used a 1/2 tsp of that, instead. Oh, and I didn't bother to add the sugar since balsamic vinegar already has some sweetness to it.",
