Unfortunately they were so tough we couldn't really eat them. What I did get to taste I thought was very excellent. I just made them again tonight with the same marinade but this time I cooked them low and slow in the crock pot. They did get very tender then we threw them on the bbq for a few minutes and then brushed them with the marinade. These were good this way but still didn't replicate the taste from the original recipe. Still looking for the right way to cook them with the taste from this recipe but not so tough. The taste is excellent but the cooking method doesn't work for me.",

I am a very good cook and make a lot of good things and my husband loves almost everything I make. However he said this was hands down the BEST THING I have ever made. I made a lot and he ate almost three pounds of ribs. The one thing I did use as well was Korean hot sauce as the recipe didn't specify and I wanted to be close to authentic. Korean hot sauce has a fairly unique taste and has a bit of a sweet note. I served this with the Korean spicy cucumbers also on this site. The whole meal was absolutely delicious!!!",
