In fact my boss and his 8 year old daughter were scolded for sneaking off with them and not sharing. I did have to bake them longer then the 15 mins it was closer to 25-30 minutes. I did try them while I was putting the gife basket together and they were wonderful. But everbody has enjoyed them great recipe. Thank you.",

I modified it a little by using toasted sliced almonds and dried cranberries and dried pineapple instead of dates. It is strong in almond flavor but I love almonds so no problem for me.
