I increased frozen peas to 1 cup, as well as 1/2 cup each of celery and carrots, as I felt it needed more veggies. I added 1/4 cup of wine and a splash of Worcestershire sauce, as well as salt and pepper for a bit more flavor. I also used frozen pie crusts (defrosted of course!) and brushed a beaten egg white on the top before baking, which makes a nice golden, flaky crust. I didn't have the time to wait an hour for it to cool, so after cooking the filling, added the cheese right away and immediately put the pie in the oven. It turned out great! One of our favorite quick meals!",
