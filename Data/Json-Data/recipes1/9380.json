I halved recipe, used a standard sized loaf pan. Using kitchen shears, I did cut some of the graham crackers to fit the pan. I dipped the graham crackers into milk before placing in the pan to soften up slightly. I did not put the chocolate on the dessert until after it set up. Instead of refrigerating for 4-24 hours, I froze for 2 hours. Drizzled chocolate sauce upon serving.  I used french vanilla pudding, next time I will use cheesecake flavor.  I think I will also add a cooled layer of chocolate upon the second graham cracker layer, then refrigerate until firm, then add the next layer of pudding and top layer of graham cracker.",

PERFECT! 15 servings =WW 4pts if you use all FF~SF ingredients. Frosting included. Layers should be grahams~1/2 of the pudding~grahams~rest of the pudding~top w/grahams. I flipped top layer over so a THIN layer of pudding would be on very top~you'll need to even out the pudding on top with a butter knife. Do this before frosting with chocolate. This helps to soften grahams. ENJOY. IT's GREAT! The frosting is not FF or SF~ mix: 3T melted butter with 1/4c Hershey's cocoa then add 1 1/2c powdered sugar 2t corn syrup 2t vanilla 2T milk mix. SPREAD on top. This is JUST like eclair frosting.",
