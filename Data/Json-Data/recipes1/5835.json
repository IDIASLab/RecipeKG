It was wonderful!  We put it over egg noodles.  I didn't realize that I forgot the cheese the first time around.  With the leftovers we had mozzarella, so we used that.  It was SO good.  I stirred it in a little first, then put more on top once it was on the plate and let it melt.  It was amazingly good.  I will definately make this again!",
