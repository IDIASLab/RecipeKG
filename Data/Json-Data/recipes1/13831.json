                "reviewBody": "I thought this was a 5 star finished product, but it takes way longer than 10 min. prep time, melting the butter/cocoa to a boil takes at least that. Make this your first step, so it can be cooling while you deal with the dry ingredients, etc. Rather than struggling to blend eggs and sour cream into a lot of dry stuff, whisk them together separately, and add gradually while running the mixer on Stir for very short periods of time, then add the lukewarm cocoa mix (too hot and you might curdle the batter). Finish by hand. All told, it took 30 to 40 min. to get it in the oven, which is really where the ease begins. It cooks quickly and you don't have to stay up all night waiting for it to cool so you can ice it. Take the time to scale it if your pan is bigger, it is tricky to do the math but it will make a difference, you won't end up with a big flat chocolate cracker. The pan size in the text is 10X15 but the pan size in the header is different; use the 10X15 size. Multiply pan dimensions to give you sq. in. (150 for this recipe; my pan was 192). Divide your pan area by 150, and multiply the result by 35 servings. This tells you what number to plug into the servings box; hit scale and it will automatically do the conversion for you. Odd stuff like 2 1/2 eggs can be rounded to 3 without catastrophe (I did it). Or just go buy a new 10X15 pan.:)PS-sift the sugar for the icing after measuring and before mixing, for no white lumps.",

After stirring in the powdered sugar, DO work quickly to spread it on the cake.  It does become like fudge consistency as it cools.  #2 If you have not checked to see how level your oven is, you may want to do that before you start. An unlevel surface does show alot on a sheet cake.  Wonderful recipe!! You won't be disappointed!!  Thanks!!!!!!!",

This was super easy to make. Make sure that you prepare the icing when you are able to put on the cake while it is still warm, preferably right out of the oven. The icing gets stiff fast so the warm cake helps it spread. My family also loves to pair this up with vanilla ice cream. Being from San Antonio where pecan trees are in the back yard, we only make this with pecans, not walnuts. If you are one to worry about calories and fat content this recipe isn't for you, enjoy!  ;-)",

I made it for company last night and I am being tempted with what is left of this large delicious cake!  This was the first time making this cake...I was pleasantly surprised.  If you like chocolate, I don't see how you wouldn't like this cake.  It is moist and rich, but not too rich where you say you can't eat it(obviously I am not having that problem).  I made it in a 10x15 pan, that I thought was only good for making my cookies.  I used Baker's Joy cooking spray to grease my pan(very easy).  This is a thinner cake, but I liked it the way it was.  You have a better icing to cake ratio this way :) I suggest starting the icing approx. 10 minutes prior to the cake coming out of the oven.  That way the cake is done right when you are done with the icing.",
