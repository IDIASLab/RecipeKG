I read all the reviews and took all the suggestions that were offered that were similar.  Below is how I ended up re-writing the recipe - it turned out moist, spicy, and DELICIOUS!!  My family has already asked me to make this at Christmas!!\r\n\r\n15 Oz Can Pumpkin;\r\n4 Eggs;\r\n1/2 Cup Veg. Oil;\r\n1/2 Cup Applesauce (I used sweetened);\r\n2 Cups Sugar;\r\n3 1/2 Cups Flour;\r\n2 Tsp. Baking Soda;\r\n1 1/2 Tsp Salt;\r\n1 Tsp. Cinnamon;\r\nSplash of Vanilla;\r\n1/4 Tsp Pumpkin Spice;\r\n1 Cup Walnuts;\r\n1/2 Cup Raisins;\r\n1 Tsp Nutmeg;\r\n1/2 Tsp Cloves; \r\n1/4 Tsp Ground Ginger;\r\n\r\nBlended and cooked as described in original recipe.. Both placed in the oven at the same time, the Muffins were done in 40 minutes and Bread was done in 1 hr 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nWhile on Cooling rack, poked holes in top of muffins and bread, and poured seperate hot Cinnamon Sugar Butter combo over holes, allowing it to seep down inside.  Yummmmmmmmy!  Will make again and again!  Thanks for all the tips everyone!\r\n",

The only new things I did were add a teaspoon of vanilla and 1 1/2 teaspoons of pumkin pie spice(I did not have any cloves). I also used one cup of packed light brown sugar and two cups of regular sugar. I baked mine in one pyrex loaf pan(only one I have) and also made 12 muffins.  The one cup of oil was not a problem for me at all, nothing came out greasy. I also sift all my dry ingredients together(not sugar). I will be making this again for Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nUpdate: 11/3/06-  This was so yummy my husband actually asked for more the other day.  This also freezes really well.  I froze most of the 12 muffins I made and when defrosted, they were still really good. 11/26/08- Yes, I am still making this recipe, today in fact! We now like to add chocolate chips. About 1 cup does the trick, as we don't like many, just enough to give it a chocolate taste. Tip: Freeze the chocolate chips before hand if you want them to retain some of their shape when done cooking.",

To make this recipe even more of a taste-alike, I added an additional 1/2teaspoon of ginger, 2/3 cup each of golden and dark raisins, then topped unbaked loaves with toasted walnut bits. My husband did a taste test between the Starbucks and this recipe with its adjustments and couldn't tell the slices apart! This is a definite keeper in my family!",

                "reviewBody": "I chose this recipe due to the reviews, and made the recipe exactly as given.  I found it good, but not great.  I baked mini loaves, and got 16 loaves total.  The first half, I left the recipe \"as is\", the second half, I added 1/2 tsp vanilla (had only half the batter left), doubled the spice amounts, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the tops.  The recipe was way better with the changes.  I found my mini loaves baked perfectly in 25 minutes.  In the second batch, I also added a few chocolate chips and walnut pieces and dried cranberry to one of the loaves.  I couldn't taste the cranberry, but the chocolate chips and walnuts made it even better (never had this combo before, really wasn't sure it would be good...) It was heavenly!!!  When I make it again, I'll be adding the choc chips and walnuts, for sure!  I will continue to use this recipe, but with the modifications mentioned above.",
