Maybe that is why some people have complained about the texture of the cake... I make this cake for my mom's birthday every year - it's been her favorite cake since she was a kid. The dark chocolate swirls are a nice contrast to the sweet fluffy chocolate filling. It is best served cold and we think it gets even better a day or two after it is made. To answer another reviewer's question yes it should read 1 1/4 cups evaporated milk in the cake itself and another 1/4 cup evaporated milk in the filling. I buy a regular 12oz can of evaporated milk measure out 1/4 cup milk for the filling then dump the rest of the can into the cake batter. I have measured it though and it ends up being just about 1 1/4 cups.",

I made this recipe but made it with butter instead of shortening. It was a flop. It raised then fell in the center. It was dry not moist like I remember my grandmother's. Also it fell apart when I tried to cut the layers. This recipe calls for two tablespoons of baking powder. I think this is part of the problem. I'm wondering if anybody else has had a similar experience with this recipe. Also my grandmother didn't make the filling like this recipe called for. I know that she changed it. She would whip cream add cocoa powder vanilla and sugar. I'm not sure if she added fine granulated sugar or confectioners sugar. I am still trying to perfect this recipe.",

I've made the cake before from a hand-me-down hand-written recipe with uneven success. The issue is the quantity of two ingredients. Specifically is it really 2 TABLESPOONS of baking powder? Or 2 teaspoons? 2TBS sounds like too much. Also I understood that the total evaporated milk was 1 1/4 cups divided between the cake (1 cup) and the filling (1/4). Please confirm that it is really 1 1/4 cups of evaporated milk in the flour mix; and another 1/4 cup later in the filling. My concern is that with the ingredients as now listed the cake mix will be too wet (that extra 1/4 evaporated milk) and might rise so high (2 TBSP baking powder) as to flop.",

It has a fine old-fashioned texture (not greasy like cake-mix cakes) and holds together really well considering you have to slice it crosswise. I thought that was the trickiest part. You can control how bittersweet the decoration is by how much you swirl the pinwheels. I found I had to drizzle the chocolate fairly close to the pan edge otherwise the pinwheels shrink toward the center; and cut the chocolate deep into the cake as I swirl or else it forms a bitter crust.",
