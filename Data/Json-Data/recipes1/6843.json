I made it for my father's birthday(a day ahead of time) The icing a little thinner than I like but I know cornstarch(a teaspoon at a time) will thicken any liquid. Also I put the icing between the layers and on the top only. Used fudge icing for the sides and a border on the top then filled in the top with this icing and used the fudge one to write on the cake with. As for the double broiler issue as was suggested a metal or glass bowl in a pot. Also due to modern convinece a micro wave works well to(30 seconds at a time and stirring between each time segmant. But the most important thing I think everyone should remember is this. Baking is an exact SCIENCE! If you do not follow the messurments precisley the recipe is doomed before it every goes into the oven.",

The author of this recipe might want to include the number of minutes neccessary to acheive this \"Thick\"ness. Also a double boiler?????????? I don't know anyone that even OWNS a double boiler other than my grandmother. Needless to say my friend did not have a birthday cake for her birthday. Thanks.",
