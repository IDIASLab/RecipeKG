One thing I would do differently next time is to toss the apples and cranberries together with the sugar etc.  I usually pile my apples really high because they shrink when cooking - I couldn't do that and put the cranberries on top because the cranberries would roll off.  So my pie ended up very thin.  Delicious but more the thickness of a tart.  With that one change this would be 5+ stars.  I do believe this will be making an appearance at the Thanksgiving dessert table.",

I did make a change in the mixing of the ingredients.  I folded the apples, cranberries, sugar, cornstarch and cinnamon together before adding it to the crust.  I also zested the peel from an orange that I had in the mix.  Dotted the filling and added the top crust.  I had Honey Crisp and Granny Smith apples, so I used a mixture of both kinds.  Wonderful served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  SaraSunshine, you have a winner on your hands - thanks for sharing.",

Berries will pop  and will have a consistency of  soft jam as they cool . I added   the cinnamon to the cooling cranberries,  and also used 1/2 cup  brown sugar, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, apples were then mixed in.  I also added  1/4 cup of finely chopped pecans.  I substituted 2 tbsp minute tapioca for the cornstarch. I used Gala apples.   great flavors, tangy without  bitterness or overwhelming  sweetness and most important these changes worked for my family.",

I know they're relatively tart anyways but mine just seemed way too sour. Some of them unbearably so. That said... I like the other reviewers mixed the apples sugar cornstarch and cranberries together. Just makes more sense to do it that way. Next time I make this I'll be changing the amount of cranberries to only a cup or maybe even just half a cup. Overall really good and everyone that tried it liked it. A nice variation on apple pie. And for those curious I used gala apples.",

The result was a delicious pie with the perfect balance of tartness and sweetness.   I used granny smith apples and increased the number of apples to eight.   Decreased the amount of fresh cranberries to 1  1/4 cups.   Used 1/2 cup granulated sugar and a 1/4 cup dark brown sugar.  Added 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Substituted two tablespoons of all purpose flour for the cornstarch.   Cooked the flour in the two tablespoons of melted butter  over low heat for about 30 seconds.   Removed from the heat and stirred in the sugar, salt and spices  Tossed the apples and cranberries with the sugar-spice mixture in  large bowl before adding the filling into the  prepared pie pan.  Baked for 50 minutes.   It was a hit at this year's Thanksgiving feast.  Will definitely be making this one again.",
