For a decent sized pork roast 145-150 is a more correct target that will eventually rise towards 160 as it rests. Taking out at 160 guarantees overcooking. For those complaining about cook time inaccuracy you don't know how to cook a roast. Time is a guideline it is done when it is done not when the timer goes off. Get a meat thermometer and use it. Learn the proper temperatures for cooking various cuts of meat.",

I took suggestions from several reviewers and cut slits in the roast & filled them with part of the garlic and fresh rosemary that I pressed slightly with the side of a small spoon to release the flavor & aroma. I then rubbed the roast with the olive oil & spread additional garlic & rosemary over it along with some salt & pepper. I roasted it for 15 minutes at 450 then reduced the temperature to 300 for 90 more minutes basting occasionally. It was amazingly tender juicy and delicious! I made gravy with the pan drippings and served slow-cooker mashed potatoes pesto tomatoes (both recipes from this site) and steamed broccoli sprinkled with freshly ground Parmesan. We had enough meat & potatoes for leftovers that we had with applesauce and a green tossed salad. It was just as good the second time around! Thank you Stacy!",
