This 'cake' is usually made and eaten during the Chinese New Year or its slices are usually found all year round among the DIM-SUMs in the Chinese restaurants. You can chill it in the fridge, but it should always be eaten HOT after re-heating either in the microwave, or frying in a few tablespoons of oil. This cake can be kept for 1 week in the fridge (but usually it's finished within a day!!)",

I feel that this particular recipe used too much white pepper powder and spice powder therefore making the cake too \"spicy.\" Also it would be helpful if the instructions included the actual amount of turnips used instead of just saying \"3 turnips\" because turnips vary in sizes which may make the recipe confusing.",

I run a restaurant and made it Thursday for a dim sum new year's celebration. I took another reviewer's recomendation and reduced the pepper and 5 spice powder by half. I also reduced the sausage by about two thirds and the mushrooms to 8 dried. The concerns about the size of the turnips are not really relevant although I did add some of the shrimp soaking liquid to make sure it was moist as my turnips didn't produce any liquid. I used brown rice flour the first time as my store was out of white and used white the second time with no significant differences in taste. One of my customers commented that it is the perfect vechicle for hot chili oil.",

But I will definitely try this again but won't wait until Chinese New Year! Update: I made these again with the same result--they are just too gummy. A Chinese friend thinks they need more turnip and mushroom and less flour. You need to use a real Chinese radish (lo bak) our generic turnips. The recipe is tasty but the texture is just too gummy and dense.",
