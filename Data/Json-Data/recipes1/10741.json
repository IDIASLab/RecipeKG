I also whipped up a bit of cream, folded the chocolate in, and then added the whipped egg whites to make the mousse a bit creamier. I do like the fluffiness that comes from the egg whites in this recipe though... it's like eating a chocolate cloud! I used half milk & half dark chocolate (found pure dark to be too rich the first time around), and waited until it had cooled to body temperature (test temp on your wrist) before adding the egg yolks. The chocolate-yolk mixture gets quite thick, but if you fold it right after you combine the yolk & chocolate, it blends just fine. For added pizzaz, I drizzled some melted chocolate in random patterns onto waxed paper, cooled it in the refrigerator, then broke off the chocolate \"designs\" and stuck it into the mousse, which had been spooned into wine glasses. My friends loved the dessert, and now think I'm Martha, all for relatively little effort! Thanks for the yummy recipe!!",

Yeah, it didn't.\r\n\r\nOh well, I ended up beating the chocolate into the egg whites and it still tasted good (its hard to screw up chocolate THAT much), just not fluffy at all.",
