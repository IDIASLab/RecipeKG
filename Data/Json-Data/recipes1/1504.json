I replaced angel food cake with white cake. The frosting is very light and not too sweet (just the way I like it). The only problem was the cocoa mixed with strawberries made the cake look an ugly brown - not very pretty. I made it the second time, without the cocoa. Instead of scooping out the middle, I made 2 8-inch cakes and layered them on top of the other with frosting & strawberries in the middle. And instead of MIXING the frosting with strawberries, I just frosted the cake and placed the strawberries on top of it and around it. Some rasberries and mint leaves in the middle to garnish. The second time was the charm!",

To make my life a bit easier, I bought an angel food cake from the grocery store and used chocolate flavored cool whip. I also mascerated my strawberries and filled the center hole with them for an even prettier presentation. Light, refreshing and a perfect dessert after a big dinner. Thank you so much Carole!",
