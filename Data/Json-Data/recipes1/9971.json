I put in three whole boneless skinless chicken breast on the bottom, sprinkled with my favorite spices, mixed pepper and a little red pepper flakes, basil, then topped with everything except the broccoli, cauliflower and spinach. I let it slow cook for 5 hours, then removed the chicken which fell apart on its own to cut into bite size peices, which could be done with a fork, then threw the chicken back in with the brocc, cauli, and three times more spinach since I love it and let it cook for another hour or so.  I'm keeping this one in the archives.  Thanks for the great idea.  Oh yeah, I also only used one can of chicken broth instead of the 4 cups because that's all I needed to make enough broth to cover my ingredients.",

I used a whole chicken cut up(not boneless/skinless) then deboned and deskinned my chicken and used the broth from that to prepare the soup. I used more vegetables pretty much doubled the amount in the recipe and did not use hot sauce because my tots would not go for it and this soup was a HIT! It was very very hearty and very tasty. Served over rice or noodles it is perfect for small children who in our home generally don't like soup. Defintely a keeper and we'll have this again and again. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!",
