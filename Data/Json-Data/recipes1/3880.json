Used Ricotta instead of cottage cheese, Added 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella to each layer, substituted equal amount of bread dipping spices for basil. Substituted 1 can of cream of shrimp soup for 1 of the cans of cream of mushroom. ***Also a big tip is to make sure your seafood is dry, especially scallops. I rinse all my seafood and put it in a plastic strainer over a larger bowl, covered in fridge for a few hours. Wet scallops will water down a dish like this! Make sure scallops are dry-packed. I also added a lot more parmesan cheese. Will make again!",

I also used tilapia instead of flounder. It was absolutely delicious and I'm not even a big seafood fan. The only problem I had was the top layer of lasagna was crispy and the cheese was too well done. Next time I'll end with the seafood layer and add the cheese a half hour before the lasagna is done. Thank you so much Karena.",

Used white zinfandel wine and Ricotta cheese as others suggested. A couple of things that may help clarify this a bit. Cut your flounder into bite size pieces microwave your cream cheese for a few seconds to soften so it will stir in easily with the ricotta (you don't need a mixer for this recipe). I also used the no-cook lasagna noodles - that was a big time saver.(if you use no-cook noodles make sure they have sauce on top of them while cooking or they won't soften up. Prep took me about 25 mins but remember I didn't have to cook my noodles. If your shrimp is already cooked and peeled you probably can cut prep time down to 15 mins. It's good and may encourage non fish-eaters!!",
