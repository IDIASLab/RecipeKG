Instead of corn syrup I used 1/2 cup of honey and 1/2 cup of aunt jemima syrup (haha). I used cappuccino chips because I just wanted a different flavour. Otherwise I did everything the same and YUM!! I also pressed it into a pan lined with wax paper to make them come out nicer. I also found that in order to get 36 bars you really have to cut these small (less than an inch to get 12 across the pan - not what the picture would suggest). Not really realistic for anyone to eat them that small but it doesn't really matter. But if you are making this for a group you might over estimate what you have that's all. Because I had used honey and syrup they came out a little soft but I think they are better that way anyway they don't even taste like a granola bar.",

My daughter loves them. To keep them crunchy, I individually wrapped them in plastic wrap and then stored them in an airtight container. For a not-so-wholesome change, I switched half the peanut butter with Nutella which made for a yummy option. I believe Nutella separates when over heated, so I suggest you heat the corn syrup and 3/8 cup peanut butter first. Take it off the heat before mixing in the Nutella. Both ways are very good.",
