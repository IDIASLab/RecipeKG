I did grate my own carrots but that's it. Moist and flavorful! Loved it! I doubled the frosting recipe as suggested. If you're going to make 9 in cake I think that's a good idea. Probably not necessary if you make a 9x13. I didn't add the lemon peel just the juice and a tsp of vanilla. The frosting was great as well. Not too sweet just enough. Going forward this will be my only carrot cake recipe!!!! YUMMY",

I did everything the same except here are the changes I made: I poured the pineapple juice over the raisins microwaved 60 seconds and set aside once ready to add I drained them first. I shredded my carrots VERY fine (smallest whole on grater) so I put aprox 3 cups (it's a lot). I added \"2\" tsp cinnamon omitted ginger and instead I added 1/2 tsp allspice and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I also added 1 cup walnuts (what's carrot cake without them) and 1/2 cup flaked coconut. I baked it in a 9x13 air bake pan for 40 min exactly and it came out perfect! This is a VERY moist dense and flavorful carrot cake (just the way I like it)! Both my son and fiance really liked it too! In fact my fiance (who's usually not a big fan of carrot cake) said \"I know what cake I want for my birthday\" (he couldn't stop eating it)! I used the Cream Cheese Frosting 11 by: Janni (on all recipes). Only change I made there was I put a total of 2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar. Again both my son and fiance said \"I really like that frosting\"! Both are a WINNER! I now have my own recipe for whenever I want a great carrot cake! Wish I knew how to add a picture.",
