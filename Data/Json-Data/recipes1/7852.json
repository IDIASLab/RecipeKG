Rubbing the garlic directly on the bread may make it strong -- but it IS the authentic method -- it's how they did it while I was in Italy.  One good suggestion is to drizzle olive oil over the top of the tomatoes. FRESH basil is NECESSARY for this recipe!!  Great, Authentic Recipe!!\r\ndeb",

The only things that I do differently are to brush the bread with a little olive oil before toasting, and to leave out the onion and instead add shredded mozzerella cheese to the mixture.  Cooks, be sure to use Roma plum tomatoes; it's the only way to make bruschetta.  I'd also caution people to be careful not to rub too much garlic on the bread; it will overpower the tomato mixture and ruin the recipe! Which would be really, really tragic.",

I made some modifications: use dried Italian seasoning instead of the fresh added a splash of balsamic vinegar and added some salt and crushed red pepper. The basic recipe just seems way too bland.
