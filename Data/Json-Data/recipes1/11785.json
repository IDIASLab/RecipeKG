It's good the way that it's written but we like to tweak the ingredients just a little bit to make it suit our family's taste. I use a can of Campbells Fiesta Cheese soup instead of the shredded cheddar. It gives the casserole an even creamier texture and I like the kick that the peppers in the soup offer. Also you can really use any 2 \"cream of\" soups that you have on hand. I have used cream of celery cream of chicken cream of mushroom...the possibilities are endless. Make this your own and enjoy!",

This was not a very popular dish with anyone to include our 6 year old son or my teenage daughter who loves all things potato. This was quite dry ( I used all the required liquid) and rather bland. The consistency of the hashbrowns was also somewhat off. My 10 year old son (also a potato fan)thought it would have tasted much better fried up which we did try for the second go around (still quite dry) When we were on the third night of it (and this is a rather hearty family of 6 -so you can imagine how well this went over the third night) I used it as a topping for two pot pies I had made -sort of a la a shepherds pie. Still not a favourite. But...it did pass the Wolseley test -(Wolseley=our much loved black lab) gobbled it up. On the positive side -quick and cheap to make so I could see how this would be a fan favourite at potlucks or family parties.",
