I was a bit concerned because this was my very first time using a slow cooker, and the directions say \"cook on low for 4 hours\", whereas in my crockpot (Rival 6 qt oval time programmable) the 4 hour option is in the \"high\" temp.  It wasn't a problem at all.  4 hours was the perfect amount of time for my 2.69 lb pork loin.  I followed the instructions to the letter because the ingredients seemed perfect---and they were.  For the wine, I used the wine I was drinking that night---a cabernet sauvignon.  Also, halfway through the cooking time I did stab the pork a couple of times so that the sauce would seep in.  I served this with some mashed potatoes (perfect side dish because there was plenty of sauce left over). I did thicken the sauce a bit after the pork was cooked and had been taken out of the slow cooker.  I used 2 tbsp of cornstarch and enough water to dissolve it and remove any lumps.  I poured this into the crockpot and stirred for a minute and let it sit in a high temp for 10 min.  It was great---a definite keeper!",

Here is what I did - we are not big garlic people, so I made a dry rub of salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder and rubbed the tenderloin down.  Then I seared it in a pan before putting it in the crockpot.  The rest of the ingredients, I mixed them all in a bowl (used the liquid to deglaze the pan I seared in for the heck of it), and poured that over the pork.  When it was done (cooked it for 6 hours on low), I poured the juices in a saucepan, brought them to a boil, and added flour and water to make gravy.  Amazing is right!",

My choice of wine was what I had... a Chianti. Other than that, it came down to adding a bit more flavor. I added rosemary, thyme, celery powder, a splash of worcestershire, granulated garlic and parsley. Cook time was right on, and the Tenderloin was \"melt in your mouth.\" Strained the onion into the au jus to thicken the gravy slightly, (which was delish,) and served with mashed potatoes.

After reading a couple of reviews that complained about it being bland, I decided that I was going to put slivers of garlic in the roast before cooking it.  I LOVE garlic, and ended up using half a head (yeah, that's not a typo) throughout the roast.  If you've never done it before, all you do is stab the roast and shove a clove or half a clove in the slit.  This way the flavor permeates the meat.  Anyway, I used LOW SODIUM soy sauce and everything else as stated.  It was done and super tender after the four hours, but I cooked it on low for about another half hour then kept it on warm until my husband came home.  I decided to add a little corn starch to thicken the juices, and man, was this roast incredible!  I could cut the meat with my fork!  Everyone should absolutely try this once!",

Dry onion soup is high in salt and also  contains MSG another salt/flavour enhancer. Better to use either a sliced fresh onion  or 1T of dehydrated onions and a cup of low sodium beef broth. Soy sauce is another source of high sodium; the alternative is low salt soy sauce. For a crust, roll the tenderloin in salt free crackers and potato flakes mixed with herbs de provence (basil,parsley,marjoram,chevril and oregano) or herbs of your choice. For those who want that extra kick of salt add it to your own serving at the table.",
