If you would like to use the marinade as a sauce, you can boil it after removing the meat and add a little slurry of cornstarch and warm water to thicken it. When I make the sauce, I usually add some sesame seeds for looks. You can add fresh or ground ginger if you like, too.",

After reading the reviews, I tossed the store bought marinade in the trash.  I changed the recipe slightly by adding 2 more cloves of garlic, 2 tsp of minced candied ginger, and 1 tbl of cornstarch.  I microwaved it on high for 3 minutes and then poured it over skinless, boneless, chicken breasts that I had pounded flat.  I baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  The sauce thickened nicely, and I had plenty to put on top of the chicken.  I served it all over steamed jasmine rice, and topped it with fresh cilantro and sliced green onions.  It had a wonderful flavor and so much better than any other teriyaki that I have had.",
