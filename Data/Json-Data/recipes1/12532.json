Apply butter evenly, then sugar/cinnamon mixture.  Holding the rolling pin, gently roll over the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  At the beginning of the roll only 1/2\" of dough and pinch down.  Now you must begin rolling from each corner, middle, working your way back and forth.  Curve your corners toward the center to avoid too much overlap (exess)  IMPT:  after about 2-3 rolls, carefully lift up each portion and pull away from you, this will \"tuck\" in the dough, be careful not to tear the dough.\r\n\r\nA lot to remember, but after you get the hang of it, it's like second nature and you will have picture perfect cinnamon rolls and sticky buns",

I would suggest not melting the butter that you spread on the inside before you roll it up.  If you just spread on a thin layer of softened butter you should end up with a more ooey-gooey feel because you'll have more butter on the inside to melt, which will make the caramel more gooey.  When you use the melted butter you don't get a lot of butter on the inside & I found this tended to give me a dryer--but still good--caramel roll.  I will try again, but next time I won't melt my butter.\nHave made a couple more times & it definitely works better not to melt the butter for the inside and then I double the caramel for the bottom.  Still a good recipe, hence the 4 stars, but does need some adjustments.",

                "reviewBody": "Great Recipe! For those of you who are novice bakers like myself, I'll share a few things I learned after a lot of trial and error and more reading. First, this recipe should be read closely as there are a lot of steps and can be confusing. Kneading was the difficult part for me. You must knead at least the recommended time if doing it by hand (8min for this recipe). In the past I didn't knead enough and my bread didn't come out fluffy, I couldn't figure out what went wrong because the dough would rise nicely. Kneading is key!! Add a little flour if it gets too sticky to work with/ lightly dust. The dough should feel harder the more you knead and you'll know its ready when you pinch it between your fingers and it feels like your earlobe. If in doubt, knead some more. It is difficult to over knead by hand. Also, when making the caramel you may want to do extra. I made double but make sure the sugar has completely dissolved so that it turns into caramel. I think it should be cooked at medium-high heat but watch carefully so it doesn't burn. Lastly, I cooked at 375 for 25min (min time recommended) and I was disappointed that after all the work they were over cooked on the top. I don't know if the temp was too high or time was too long, just make a note and watch carefully. No one mentioned this in other reviews so maybe it was just my oven. Next time I will try 350 degrees...My first review on here so hope it was helpful :) Good Luck!!",

They are one of those treats you do only a couple of times a year because they are not the healthiest thing but flavor-wise they are awesome.  We did not add the pecans because my kids do not like the nuts but they were great.  Present Idea: Prepare batches and put them in disposable aluminium containers - you can give them away and put the baking instructions and a DO NOT BAKE UNTIL CHRISTMAS MORNING Sign.  They will love it and remember you on Christmas morning when the cinnamon smell comes out of the oven! Thanks for the recipe.",
