I used quite a bit more gouda than the recipe because I had it and a red pepper instead of green (red was curiously less expensive than the green).   And of course, it took me a bit longer than 50 minutes to get it finished.  Maybe I'm a slow veggie chopper.  Worth the work and I will definitely make this one again!",
