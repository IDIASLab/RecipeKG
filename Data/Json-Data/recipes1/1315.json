Since first making this with great success the last 2 times it has been a total flop. It did not rise much less fall and it was dry and tasteless. I can account for part of the problem since I did not use chocolate chips that I normally put in but am wondering if the baking mix could be outdated? I am going to try one more time using a fresh box of baking mix and adding the chocolate chips as I hate to abandon a recipe that I previously used with such success.",
