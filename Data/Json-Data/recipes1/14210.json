Make sure to use a large stock pot to cook the wild rice in because you end up adding a lot more to the pot later on. For the herbs I used 1 Tbsp. rosemary 2 Tbsp. basil 1 Tbsp. oregano 1 Tbsp. thyme 1/2 Tbsp. marjoram and 1/2 tsp. ground sage. I also added 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. The great thing is you can adjust the herbs according to your tastes. To cut costs I only used raisins and craisins (skipping the apricots and cherries). It still turned out fabulous!",

I used microwave bacon (I hate bacon grease) and set it aside. I sauteed the onion and celery and added the fruit to the rice while the rice was still a little 'wet'. Added the celery and onion the dry herb mix (basil organo thyme sage) to the rice and fruit and cooked on med-low until everything was cooked through. Added the bacon and parley and mixed until warm. This is an incredible dish. DH and I plan on using this a a foundation form here on out and will play around with substituting the bacon for chicken sauage and the fruits and herbs.",
