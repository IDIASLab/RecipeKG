But the recipe could use improvements. 1. half a teaspoon(or more) of vanilla adds a lot of flavor. 2. Some of my tasters felt that there was too much of a \"butter felling\" in the texture; the method I used for correcting the texture was adding small amounts of extra confectioners sugar no more than half a cup to the frosting and whipping it for a couple of minutes longer. If the frosting became stiff you would have to 1 to 2 tablespoons of whipping cream. After adding the extra sugar the frosting became to sweet so to tone down the sweetness I slowly added pinches of salt to the frosting a baker's secret. Be very careful not to add too much salt!",
