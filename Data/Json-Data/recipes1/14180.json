                "reviewBody": "It was a really good starter recipe.  I added a bit to the ingrients, pickling salt, and changed the cooking method a bit.....I added a few spices like dill and basil, for just a little extra and added all sorts of different peppers esp hotter ones like chili peppers to give it a bit of color and extra kick since the vinegar and cooking will take away the heat of the peppers. BTW, if you don't like the heat of the peppers, you can add a little oil to the bottom of the jars before filling and it will help to take away some of the kick of the peppers!  I also put some pickling salt in the vinegar/water before boiling, just a TBSP or so.  Takes away a bit of the sour taste some might get.  I also filled the jars differently, making it a lot easier and a lot less dangerous in my opinion.  Instead of actually cooking the peppers, onions, garlic, and spices with the Vinegar/Water; I stuff them into clean jars and poured the really hot vinegar/water mixture over them.  I then re-cooked the jar with lids on to make them seal, like the recipe.  This allowed the peppers to cook in the jars through the boiling process, but not lose as much heat and crunch.  It was also a little easier in my opinion, allowing me to stuff my jar completely with the cool, just cut ingredients, instead of having to ladle and stuff hot peppers into the jars, making sure they were filled and not burning myself in the process.   Hope that helps and thanks for the great idea!",

I had some of the mixture left that wouldn't fit in the jars, so I added some more peppers for a few minutes, added 1/4 c. sugar and 1 T. salt, tossed it in the blender, and made some kickin' hot sauce.

I never seem to get enough peppers to do large batches so I scale down this recipe to do one jar at a time and then I refrigerate shortly afterward.  Sometimes I will cut up new peppers and put them directly in the previous, already being used, jar and it turns out well.  Great flavour overall and I hope to plant more next year just so I can use this recipe again and have more!",
