I doubled the recipe as follows:  1/2 c. apple cider vinegar, 1 cup ketchup, 3/4 c. water, 1/2 c. brown sugar, sprinkle of Lawry's seasoning, a couple dashes of worcestersire sauce, and... I sauteed a 1/4 of a small onion (chopped fine)and 1 chopped garlic clove and tossed it all in the bowl at the same time.  I did make a couple of squirts of ketchup to make a thicker consistency.  After all that....I had some boneless pork ribs, tossed them in the crockpot and put the BBQ mixture over the top.  Stirred together and cooked about 4 hrs. on high, then turned to low until we were ready for dinner.  When we were ready to eat, I took a large slotted spoon and separated the pork.  I then ladled it onto good hamburger buns and even the kids ate all their dinner!  I think next time I will use the Hawaiian buns.  Overall, YUMMY!! (even hubby said so and he doesn't say things too often!)",
