Instead of using a white cooking wine, I decided to go with Moscato, it's a pear based white wine, and figured it would be perfect for diluting my pear puree. (And it worked great)! 3. Due to horrible weather conditions, I couldn't grill it outside, so I cooked it up in a cast iron skillet... and it still turned out perfect.",

So I used some slightly diluted frozen apple juice concentrate instead.  I also saved the marinade and boiled it in a sauce pan to disinfect and reduce it.  I used flap meat instead of sirloin because that's what I had (again, didn't want to leave the house in this heat).  I seared the meat in a very hot cast iron skillet, removed it and then sauted the vegetables.  This came out fantastic and the reduced marinade made a lovely sauce for some bean thread noodles.  We just loved this and when it gets cooler here, I'll try the pear juice (if I can find some) and the outdoor grill.  Thank you so much for the recipe!",

It was a bit thick but turned out just the way I was hoping it would after cooking the meat ( it crytalized on the meat). I also made it quite sweet ( by around a 1/4 cup more sugar than what the recipe calls for) as the bulgogi I have had before was very sweet and my hubby likes it best that way. I also substituted Braggs liquid aminos for the soy and added a little bit more garlic. Since it is winter and we aren't using the grill I read about how to grill with your oven on ehow and used this method for the dish. It turned out perfectly \"grilled\" and was just like the authentic bulgogi I have had. It took around 25 minutes or so to be crystalized and for the marinade to be more like a sauce than a soup.",
