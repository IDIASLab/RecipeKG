We enjoy this every Christmas morning as part of our traditional Norwegian Christmas Breakfast which consists of lots of breads meats cheeses & spreads. This is not a \"traditional\" potato lefse as other reviewers stated but it is indeed a lefse. It is thicker than potato lefse & inteded to be served as more of a flat bread for spread meat & / or cheese... my favorite is simply a little butter & Norwegian goat cheese (geitost). Also if you don't have time to stand over the stove you can bake it in the oven... just watch it carefully - very lightly golden is all you need (I occasionally roll these out on a pizza stone for baking).

All the recipes called for potato. This must be a Norwegian-American thing? Or maybe they do that in a different part of Norway. At any rate this recipe is EXACTLY what I tasted in Norway and it's delicious if you place the lefse between damp towels until it's soft then layer it with butter and sugar and cut into manageable strips. It's odd and delicious freezes well and is quintessentially Norsk!",

It is the only lefse I have ever known until recently when it seems like everyone else in the world is making their lefse with potatos. Thank you for sharing this recipe. We always cook it in a 400 oven until it begins to brown. Its best if it does not brown just lightly brown on the bubbly parts. After the sheets are softened we spread butter/cinnamon/sugar mix add another sheet and cut into diamond shapes. Served as a sweet cookie.",
