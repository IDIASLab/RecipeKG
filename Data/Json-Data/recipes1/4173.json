                "reviewBody": "If my photo is approved mine is the Cinderella Barbie cake. I made this for my dd's 2nd birthday she loves Cinderella. I thought of revising this recipe because I made alot of changes but decided it best if I shared them here: I used 2 boxes of french vanilla cake mix and used 1 can diet Sprite per cake mix in place of all additional ingredients. I have a set of 3 (small medium large) pyrex bowls so I baked part of the batter in each bowl and created a 3 layer cake. I frosted the cakes with 2 jars of butter cream frosting tinted blue WARNING butter cream frosting is slightly yellow which caused my skirt to be a bit green! Then I added blue sugar crystal sprinkles for the sparkle of Cinderella's dress. After inserting the doll her pelvis was still slightly exsposed (1/2 - 1 inch) but I was able to cover it with frosting. I lucked out and found a generic Cinderella doll at the 1 store so I put the generic dress on the nicer doll and wrapped her in plastic from the torso down. I stuck the candles to her hands with artists gum. After the cake was cut I changed Cinderella back into the dress she came with originally and handed her off to my eager princess. The guests were wowed! This is such a great idea and in all honesty it was very easy and Im an ammatuer cook.;-) UPDATE: Another great idea is to use Kelly dolls and insert them into cupcakes. I'm doing that this year and may post pics. You can see instructions on Barbie.com.",

I made 2 boxes of the deluxe moist cake mix-white cake and put it in the bowl(I put shortning in the bowl so the cake wouldn't stick). I placed the bowl inside a 9X13 baking pan and filled with boiling water(a water bath). I had to bake it for a while--about an hour and 20mins--but it was VERY MOIST!! I had some splitting while trying to frost but I put it together with frosting. Everyone at the party thought I made it and kept complamenting on how great & moist it tasted.
