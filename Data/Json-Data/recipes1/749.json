The only reason I didn't mark them as 5-star was because they seemed to crisp and burn very, very easily.  I wound up having to turn my oven down by at least 10 degrees and lower the cooking time by 2 minutes from the low time given in the recipe in order to not get crisp, dark brown edges.  That being said, however, they all vanished quite quickly when I took them to work.",

Tops looked as if they may not be cooked through but they were.\n\nThey are great!!  They're very soft and chewy, with the perfect amount of sweetness.  Good job on a simple recipe!",

But for only 100 calories and 3.5 grams of fat they were very tasty. I used egg substitute instead of egg and baking raisins ( more moist) and these were delicious. Beware after just a small amount of time in the oven they look very done but they're not. They've just turned color but they're not burnt. Even better these cookies slid right off the cookie sheet and the cleanup was quite easy. Overall good recipe. I would recommend it if you're looking for a fairly quick easy recipe that tastes good and is pretty health-conscious.",
