First, I used a 9x13 glass dish, and used 1 1/2 lbs. hash browns that had diced pepper & onion in them, which added wonderful flavor, I highly recommend doing this. Second, I used 10 eggs instead of 5, which was perfect and doubled the milk. This was perfectly baked at one hour also. I used 8 ounces of Morningstar Farms vegetarian breakfast sausage sliced, and meat eaters could barely tell the difference! I will use this recipe often, and definitely make it again using regular sausage. Another tip, the last 3-4 minutes of baking, remove the foil and turn the broiler on, this really made the cheese nice. Thank you for sharing this recipe, I love it! ",

First, after reading the reviews here I decided to use a 9X13 inch baking dish.  It turned out to be the perfect size.  Since I only had 4 eggs, I just used those.  I added about 4 ounces of ricotta cheese to the eggs as well, and used a bit less milk than the recipe called for.  Also, I didn't have any sausage but did have a lot of leftover ham as well as a few slices of cooked bacon.  I sauteed the onions first, added some minced garlic, and finally tossed in the chopped ham and crumbled bacon to heat it through.  I then assembled the casserole as directed.  I only baked it for about 50 minutes total, and it was perfect.  A dollop of sour cream on top of each serving, and we loved it!  The leftovers heated up nicely for lunch the next day.  ",

Sometimes I forget to even thaw the potatoes, I just let them thaw in the pan as the oven preheats. I think the problem many are having is that they are using the diced potatoes. Maybe it's a regional thing, but around here hash brown potatoes are shredded, diced potatoes will definitely be too dry and 2 pounds way too much for this! 2 pounds of shredded potatoes though compacts nicely on the bottom of the pan. I bet making this into a couple of quiches would be delicious too!",

After reading some of the reviews I doubled all of the ingredients, except for the hash browns and cheese. Since it was Easter, I substituted the sausage for ham and bacon. Added minced onions, 3 T melted butter, 3 T bacon grease, and seasonings to hash browns and baked for 30 minutes before adding the eggs and cheese. I added the the top layer of cheese the last 10 minutes of baking time to avoid it from becoming too overdone. I am sure this dish is just as wonderful with sausage.

No way does this fit in a 2-qt or 8x8 pan. I chose a stoneware-type so it would retain heat as long as possible as I needed to transport it. Using so many of your recommendations, I assembled it the night before, I pre-cooked the froz.potatoes w/3 Tbsp melted butter (Brummel&Brown in my case) for 30 mins.@400F, and cooled completely before layering.I used 4 eggs equiv. (i.e. 1 cup) of EggBeaters, 1/2C fat-free half&half, reduced-fat bulk pork sausage,a little leftover chopped ham (if I'd had some bacon I'd have added that, too), chopped peppers w/the onions, minced garlic, a splash of Frank's Red Hot Wings sauce, finely shredded reduced-fat Mexican style 4-cheese blend (I used a bit less than 12 oz. and it was fine), freshly ground peppercorns, salt, and kept everything else the same per original recipe. I put the refrigerated dish into the cold oven, then turned it on so it could gradually heat up, and started the 1 hr. from there. Plus just under the 10 mins. uncovered, it was cooked to perfection. NO leftovers. It was a hit. LOVE a recipe that can be tweaked in so many ways and come out great!",
