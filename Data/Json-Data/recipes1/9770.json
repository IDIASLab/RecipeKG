If you are scared or have had failed at making blooming onions in the past I have some great pointers to help make one perfect.  Look at my review for the other Blooming Onion recipe on the site and I have more detailed info there.  I used to never be able to make them until I did a couple steps differently and now they turn out perfect!",
