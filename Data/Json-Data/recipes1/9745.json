It's a great dessert and one my mother made when I was a kid, well over 25 years ago! This was one of the recipes I copied from my mom's collection when I left home for the first time! This pie contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, children, the elderly, and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.",

I was skeptical of the raw egg part but hers called for it too so I added them. Hers didn't have the bananas or dates so when I followed this recipe I didn't add them. I used an entire 20 oz. can of pineapple and would do so again! I opted for the easier Cool Whip approach and used 2 cups. I chose pecans instead of walnuts (I find walnuts a little bitter) and didn't bother toasting them because the moisture of the pineapple would have softened them anyway. Letting this dessert sit for an entire 24 hours is KEY so be sure and allow time for it. Thanks for the recipe!",
