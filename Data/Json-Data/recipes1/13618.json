I used to make a batch of it, and then eat it as a quick meal in my college dormitory.\r\nAnother variation that I've tried is to add some grated parmesan cheese. \r\nA suggestion to facilitate mixing, I usually mix together the tuna, and seasonings (not the mayo) first while the pasta is cooking, this also helps with flavor balancing even though it will be strongly flavored at this point and then mix it together with the pasta and mayonnaise at the end.\r\nA slightly more exotic variation is to add a little bit of sesame oil.
