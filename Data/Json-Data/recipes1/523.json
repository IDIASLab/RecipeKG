It wasn't a very picture-perfect presentation but the taste was very good. I made this recipe almost to spec with a couple of minor notes: I used seedless red raspberry jam and while making the recipe I thought that a jam with seeds might have been better with more texture and mouthfeel (I like jam like that) but with the final result it didn't really matter to me after all. Second I used extra large eggs so my batch was a little bit eggier than normal. Lastly I used \"fancy flake sweetened coconut\" and I would've preferred to have had unsweetened shredded coconut on hand. That said this was a tasty dish which took me a week to consume. I didn't think I'd like the raspberry/coconut combination that much but it was better than I expected. One last thing: A previous reviewer thought there was \"too little dough\". I might agree that it would be better to have a little more dough in this recipe.",

I thought the presentation was nice; the bars retain their shape well. It also made the house smell heavenly. Remember to use an 8x8\" pan; there is just the right amount of crust when you do that. I needed to bake it for an additional five minutes to get the top all brown and bubbly. This is perfect for tea time as the crust is very scone-like because of the baking powder. It loses a star for me because I enjoy a more lemon bar-like crust. Serve with whipped cream and good black tea.",
