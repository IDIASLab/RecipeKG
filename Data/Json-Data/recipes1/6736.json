I used a pound cake mix as I believe it tastes more homemade and has less of that artificial flavor yellow cake mixes have (a French Vanilla cake mix would have been a fine choice too). I reserved some of the Oreos for the top leaving them in bigger chunks. It's a pretty cake striking with it's layering and sharp black and white colors interesting and really very good.",

I used a majority of the cookie crumb mixture in the middle of the cake and the rest functioned as more of a garnishment on the top. I also made a splash of extra glaze. The cake came out awesome but not to excessive fanfare due to it being rather rich after a big meal. It tastes JUST LIKE the Krispy Kreme devil's food doughnuts and therefore I would suggest this to go well with coffee. When I make it again I will definitely make more glaze though. (Hint: Poke holes with the handle of a fork in the cake before pouring the glaze... awesome!) Great easy recipe.",
