I tweaked it a little per the suggestion of other reviewers, and sauteed the garlic with some onion and added fresh spinach to that mixture (didn't even drain this before adding to the meat), and I probably used a little more feta than the recipe specified.  Next time, I would chop the spinach mixture before adding to the meat and I would add salt to the meat.  I cooked mine on the stovetop and didn't really have any issues with them being jiggly.

I added worcestershire and lemon juice as another reviewer suggested but I think I would leave out the lemon next time as it didn't seem to add anything to the taste.

My husband had a heck of a time grilling them, but he said it was worth the trouble! We ate them on buns with mayo, tomato and lettuce for dinner and then again for lunch, Yum! :o)",

                "reviewBody": "These were really good.  I added 2 cloves of garlic as was suggested, for a total of 4 cloves, and I used almost all of a 16 oz bag of spinich.  I also put two splashes of worchestershire as per another reviewers suggestion (but didn't taste it) and added salt and pepper.  The taste of these were really good, however they were a bit dry.  I am definitely going to make them again, with an aim toward them being not so dry. Lastly, I served with buns and ketchup and onions like a burger ... the first one I ate I ate on the bun, and then I ate a second bunless... bunless is DEFINITELY the way to go... the subtle tastes of the spinich and feta were lost amidst the ketchup/bun/onions, therefore, the next time I will try with tzatziki sauce as recommended.  I think the labeling of these as \"burgers\" does them injustice!  I gave 4 stars, hopefully next time I'll be able to edit and give 5!\nEDIT:  Made again, making 4 large patties which were brushed with olive oil and put in the oven at 350 for appx 35 minutes.  Served with tzatziki sauce and rice ... boy, what a yummy and gourmet tasting meal!  Upping my review to 5 stars... this was definitely the way to eat these!",
