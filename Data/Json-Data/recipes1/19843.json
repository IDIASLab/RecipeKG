        "description": "I came up with this idea one day while eating a calzone with a side of Jalapeno Poppers.  I thought a jalapeno popper pizza would be awesome.  I came home and searched online for a recipe like the one I had in mind and found recipes for jalapeno popper pizzas, but none quite like my idea.  We tried it this evening and found it to be delicious and EASY!! This would also make a great appetizer sliced into small squares.  Can't wait to try this with different meats, like sausage or ham!",

Mixed cream cheese ranch dressing and diced pickled jalapeno since I didn't have fresh. Instead of the bacon bits I used pepperoni and didn't do the buttered bread crumbs at all. I made up 2 of the pizza crusts and have more than enough of the mixture for the other 2 at another time. We loved it! Jalapeno poppers are my DH's favorite snack food next to pizza and now you've gone and combined the two! Accept my sincere thanks!!!!",

This was fun for something different and I would make it again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
