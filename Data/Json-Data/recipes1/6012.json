I use 2 1/2 pan size pans to bake this, and press it out to about 1/4 of an inch thick.  It is an irregular shape, kind of like an oval.  I also use  olive oil pan spray on my hand when pressing it out to keep it from sticking to me.  A couple of changes I made were: reduced it down to 6, but still get 8 slices. Use 2 1/2 egg whites (helps it to crisp) add garlic powder and oregano.  It browns up nicely and is the close to a hand tossed crust.",

I let the zucchini sit in a colander, weighted down with a slightly smaller bowl and some canned veggies, in the fridge for about an hour. Then I squeezed it by hand and got rid of even more water. Used just 1 whole egg and 1 egg white, and spread the mixture pretty thin, reserving leftover for a small patty to bake. Nicely crisp, and even my very picky boyfriend loved the pizza that we made. I'll make this again, despite the extra time it takes!",

                "reviewBody": "This crust recipe is brilliant!!! My family had NO idea that this was made from squash. Hubby and I are low carbers and this is a keeper in my file!!! Three things make this recipe alot less labor intensive...non stick spray, to keep the dough from sticking to your hands...parchment paper makes flipping the dough a cinch...cheesecloth lets you wring almost every drop of liquid from your squash---the drier your squash is the better your end result will be---this really is the key to success with this recipe. I shredded the squash til it was almost a puree and suspended it over the sink in a cheescloth bag for most of the day, then wrung it nearly dry. I added onion and garlic powders, oregano and pepper to the dough for added flavor. I added an extra egg white for crispness. I agree that thinner is better for this crust and might leave out the mozzarella next time, subbing it for extra parm. This makes a great traditional pie with sauce and pepperoni, but would be great with any variety of toppings. I know I won't be giving away my excess squash from the garden this year! Dawn, thank you for this wonderful guilt-free recipe!",

I'm on a modified low-carb diet (whole grains only lots of veggies) so this was perfect for me after substituting whole wheat flour. I topped this with traditional pizza toppings and it was wonderful! Definitely does not taste like squash. I used frozen grated squash from last summer's harvest. I thawed and drained it then spread it out on paper towels salted and let it stand to get out as much water as possible. I didn't have enough parmesan cheese so I used about half the amount called for and added more whole wheat flour to make up for it. When I spread it in the pan it was very sticky so I dusted it well with more whole wheat flour and rolled it out thin. It turned out very crispy and delicious!",

Also seemed like too much for the pan too thick will be dividing the recipe for two crusts next time. I love a crispier crust.
