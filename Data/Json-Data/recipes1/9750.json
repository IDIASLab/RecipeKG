Now I tinkered a lot with the recipe as I did not have time to choose something else for the meal and was out of ingredients YET this tasted GREAT.In case someone's in a circumstance like mine: THIS WORKS. Out of all purpose flour I substituted 50% whole wheat flour. Also halved this recipe as I wanted to make less. Added only one Tbs lemon juice and mixed everything with hand. Baked it in a 9\"x 5\" bread loaf pan.Inspite of all this this looked great and tasted like a wonderful coffee cake. Thanks a lot for this lovely recipe Paul.",
