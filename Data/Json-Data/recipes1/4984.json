So I was a bit hesitant to try this meal since it called for few ingredients and took little time to prepare.  Am I glad I decided to try it!!!!!\r\n\r\nNot only did it take almost no time to prepare, but it was so good we were all fighting for the last piece -- this includes my 5 and 6 year old sons.  It tasted better than many of my complicated dishes!\r\n\r\nThe only thing I would like to add is that if you like to eat the skin (come on, admit it -- some of you do love chicken skin!), cook the chicken skin side down for the first 15 minutes so that it can dry and turn crispy for the last 15-20 minutes.\r\n\r\nThank you Teresa for sharing this fabulous recipe!",

I used Kosher Salt (don't be too generous w/ salt if you are going to make the sauce), Fresh ground black pepper and dried oregano. Generously rolled each chicken thigh piece in seasonings. Brushed with the lemon juice and olive oil mixture. I used 350 oven (convection oven - roast setting)temperature. 15 min. each side. Brushed with mixtured when turning chicken pieces.(skin side up first side)Then back to first side for a quick broil on the skin side up side for just about two or three min to get the skin a bit brown. Take chicken out of oven at 170 degrees, it will rise another 10 degrees while the pieces sit on a plate. Don't let them sit in juice or they will be soggy. \nFor sauce:\nPour off juices into a cup to separate the fat. Take most fat off. Pour juices , incl. browned bits, into a sauce pan. Heat with some white wine. Cook down until about 1/3 less. Add one tablespoon unsalted butter at the very end. Pass sauce with chicken. I liked this sauce alot on the steamed broccoli I served on the side.",

To Jazz up the flavour even further I omit the pepper and instead marinate the chicken for an hr in a marinade of oregano salt lemon juice finely crushed garlic and a lil turmeric powder.

For those who found it \"bland\" I think perhaps they didn't season properly with salt and pepper. I actually didn't rub the oregano on the chicken (cause I'm lazy!) I assumed the rubbing was to release the flavor and oil of the oregano so I just crushed the oregano before dipping the chicken in it. Then I salted and peppered LIBERALLY with Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper. I DID absolutely try making the sauce by using the drippings adding 1/2 c white wine reducing then finishing with 1 T of butter. As good as the chicken was the sauce was to die for! Talk about easy! If you want to serve as a \"company dish\" it looks wonderful plated in a rotini pasta bowl topped with the chicken sliced ringed with steamed broccoli florets and drizzled with that phenominal sauce!",
