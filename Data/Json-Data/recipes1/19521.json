I doubled it because I have a pretty big family and it made far more than we needed because no one wanted to have more than a small piece it was that rich. It was also very very thick in the mixing stages; I had to stop using my electric mixer pretty early on because I didn't want to kill it. By the time I had everything ready to go in the pan I had to kneed it down with my fists to make it flat. At several stages I wondered if I had done something wrong but after checking double checking and triple checking the recipe and my measurements I can't find any error. I think maybe this is one of those recipes that shouldn't be doubled. ALL that said this \"fudge\" is. SO. GOOD. As I said it is super rich but it's also super tasty and it'll last a while which is great. I really enjoyed it and it's totally worth making especially if you're like me and aren't all to fond of chocolate.",
