It would be outrageously rich as a plated appetizer but as an hors d'oeuvre on a buffet it's perfect. Serves WAY more than 12 that way too. I prefer it with out any bell pepper. FYI- I use a hot smoked salmon vs. cold smoked such as lox. It has a flaky texture and more smoky flavor that I think works better for the recipe.",

This recipe makes a large cheesecake. Once I cut the cheesecake into 6 wedges and took 3 wedges to one party and 3 wedges to another party the next day. Arrange wedges on a thin bed of lettuce. Garnish with fresh dill and cherry tomatoes. Between the wedges place chopped onion capers and lemon wedges. Serve with favorite crackers. The cheesecake can be made a day ahead of time and brought to room temperature before serving. I have not tried freezing it but I think it would do well. This is a great recipe but costly and time consuming. One time I added red food coloring to tint this pink for a baby shower and it came out beautiful and there was none left. I use the thin sliced smoked salmon in the vacuumm type packs as opposed to the steak type salmon but I am sure that would work also. Will definately make again because....they BEG me to so what else can I do?",

I used red bell pepper I had roasted instead of green, but I did not puree the roasted red pepper like the suggestion, I just chopped and sauted the red pepper with the onions, (just like the recipe says for green bell peppers.) The red color of the red bell was nice in the finished product.   Also, I used Asiago for the 3T parmesean in the cheesecake (I still used parmesean for the crust) and Gruyere instead of Swiss.  The cake started getting very brown midway through the cooking, so I shielded the top with foil.  I served each slice on a bed of lettuce, with fresh dill and capers, and got rave reviews.  I will definitely make this again!",
