I added a little nutmeg and cinnimon to my mix I cut my toast into halves diagonally and then batter. I fried for about 3mins each side and then flip. They all turned out perfect. I had no problems.

I also made sure my oil was really hot so the bread would fry in it not just soak it up. I made a little blueberry sauce to top it off-just delish! Hubby rates it \"Five stars and two thumbs up!\"",
