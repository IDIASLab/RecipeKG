It was great and seemed to really stick together better than layering the chicken would have. Will make this again and again. Laurie",

Usually they barely eat one serving of chicken for dinner. But they all loved it and everyone asked for seconds and cleaned their plates. A big hit!! I used most of a 14 oz can of tomatoes w/chiles instead of 10 oz because I misread the recipe but it was delicious--not too spicy-just right. For those that like it spicier they can also add a little more diced tomatoes and chiles or salsa at the table. We will have this often! Also I just quickly boiled some (1 1/2 - 2 lbs) chicken breast strips for this recipe in a bit of chicken broth and water-only took 15 minutes or so.",

                "reviewBody": "My family liked this more than I did but I still would have given it a four. After making several times I have made the following changes: Omitted cream of mushroom soup in favor of lite sour cream mixed with cheddar cheese dip (Moore's brand mild flavor) -- this mixture made about a cup. I also sauteed my onions with a bit of olive oil and added three cloves of garlic a tsp of garlic powder a tsp of dried cilantro 1/2 tsp of chile powder and 1/2 tsp of dried oregano. I also used a colby/jack blend of cheese. I made more layers starting with chips then sauce then chicken then cheese and then repeated all. It filled my huge glass casserole dish. The only problem I had with this recipe is that 20 minutes on 350 (I raised the temp by 50) didn't heat it all the way through. If I hadn't decided to precook the onions they would still have been cold and crunchy. My husband loved this and so did my kids. They loved that the chips on the bottom were still crunchy. I liked that too it added some interest. I thought it was very good and I will make it again but next time I think I'll substitute some monterey jack queso dip for one can of the soup. I recommend adding your favorite spices to this dish -- I'm not sure if it would have been as good without them. UPDATE: I've found that reheating this in the oven keeps the chicken from tasting funny after refrigeration. Also the next time I made it I used jarred white queso and jalapeno dip and it was a marve",

Like some of the past reviewers suggested instead of cream of mushroom soup I use cream of celery which I think gave it a better flavor and I only used a total of 2 cups of cheese so as to not overwhelm the dish with cheese.. Also I started out with lightly sauteing the chopped onions with a little bit of garlic in olive oil. Then combined the soups and the Rotel and brought it to a boil. Then added the chopped chicken (which I used a store bought rotisserie chicken to save time) and 1 cup of the shredded cheese. Also I only layered the tortilla chips on the bottom then spread the entire chicken mixture on top. Then baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Then I topped it with the remaining cheese and baked for another 5 minutes. I think I might try it with a layer of cooked spaghetti on the bottom next time instead of chips for a little variety.",

First you MUST cook the onions first in olive oil before adding them to your mixture or they will NOT be cooked. I use a whole rotisserie chicken use 1 can cream of chicken and one can of Campbells fiest nacho cheese soup. I substitue salsa for Rotel and also add 1/2 package of Taco Seasoning Mix. I also add a can of corn. I mix everything together all at once and layer it over the chips. I reserve some of the shredded cheese for the top at the end too.
