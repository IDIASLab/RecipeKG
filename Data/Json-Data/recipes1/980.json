I think the problem with recipe is the wording regarding the measurment of the cookie crumbs--it says 1 1/8 cup of cookies, crushed. It should say 1 1/8 cups of cookie crumbs--it takes 2 cups of cookies to make the 1 1/8 cup of crumbs. If you measure the cookies instead of the crumbs you will only end up with about 3/4 of a cup of crumbs. Then yes, your mixture would be way too juicy.",

Also I doubled the recipe which made perfect use of the whole box of vanilla wafers. I agree that the dough was a bit sticky but I used powdered sugar to \"flour\" my hands for the rolling and that helped a lot. The \"1/2 (6 ounce) can of OJ\" ingredient is confusing- I think it means for a standard recipe use 3 oz. of OJ; a double recipe would be 6 oz. These started out tasting like a strong creamsicle and have mellowed over the days.",
