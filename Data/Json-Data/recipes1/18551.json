So in addition to the recipe I added another can of mandarin oranges and a can of chunk pineapple. I also added extra chopped walnuts. It finally met my taste test. Next time I will follow the recipe but add only 16 oz of whipped topping and maybe more cottage cheese for a chunkier consistency. It is a very good salad very ambrosia like.",
