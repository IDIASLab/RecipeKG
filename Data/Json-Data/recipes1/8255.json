Besides the taste being bad there was an error in the recipe which stated to mix bread crumbs and eggs together which I did and the bread mixture wouldn't adhere to the olives so I had to toss that out and dip the olives in beaten eggs and then roll in bread crumbs. This recipe is very time consuming and by all means not worth it.",

Very tasty little morsels and a big hit. I do recommend using jumbo olives so that you get the bigger hole which makes the stuffing process a little easier. Serve with marinara as a dipping sauce and you have a five star all the way!",
