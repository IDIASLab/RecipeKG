(3) mix in the marshmallows and melt them just as slowly. If the butter gets brown, the treats will be dry.  We double our recipe and it still fits fine into a 13x9 pan (grease the pan w/butter).  To make them truly gooey use the following measurements: 11.5 cups Rice Krispies, 1 whole stick of butter, (1) 16oz bag of mini marshmallows. (I always use Jet Puff brand).  I've become the neighborhood \"treat\" maker because the neighbors say theirs never turn out like mine.",

Another helpful tip, if you spray your hands with the cooking spray, you can press them into the pan without getting all sticky!",

I like them thicker, so I make them in a buttered 9x9\" pan. For extra decadence I often melt an 11 oz. package of milk chocolate chips and spread them over the top. Absolutely out of this world!",

The reason why this one is getting 2 stars is because YOU CANNOT SUB MARSHMALLOW CREME, your treats will NEVER set up. I have faithfully tried this recipe 2 times with Marshmallow creme and each time they NEVER set up, you have to eat them with a spoon. Needless to say I have wasted time and ingredients, and I have come to the conclusion that you just can't sub marshmallow creme. I have no idea why this lady is suggesting this to you because it will not work, maybe she never tried it but it just dosen't work. USE REGULAR MARSHMALLOWS!",
