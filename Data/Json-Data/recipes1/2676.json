A little sweet but that's what a cookie's supposed to be and that's what milk is for! And the extra sweetness certainly could be because I added a cup of coconut. I made a half recipe to which I added 1/2 tsp. salt to heighten flavor and didn't bother melting the butter. The traditional method of creaming the butter and sugars worked just fine. I baked my second batch longer as I unlike most people I know prefer mine a little crispier. My only criticism is that they came out a little flatter than I prefer and I even chilled the dough first. All and all a pretty darn good cookie with a nice crackly top and chewy texture from the oats and corn flakes.",

I will update the review when these are baked (they are currently chilling in the fridge). UPDATE I should not have added the 1/2 cup extra oats as this made the cookies a bit caky (cornflakes didn't affect the consistency). However the reason for the deduction of 1 star is not the batter (this is due to my changes and not the fault of the recipe) but the fact that I could taste the baking soda in the final product (and I had already made sure to use a bit less than the 1 tsp specified for the half recipe). NEXT TIME I WILL CREAM THE BUTTER AND DECREASE THE SODA",
