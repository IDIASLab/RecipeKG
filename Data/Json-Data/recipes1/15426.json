Comparatively, this recipe is nearly identical to my first one, with just a few variations to the measurements and also using entirely light Karo (mine used half dark) and also using gran sugar instead of brown. Flavor and texturally speaking it was about the same. BUT!!!!! The simplest step ever was missing from this recipe -- IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS PIE...*please*, I implore you, toast the pecans first!! Nothing to it, put them all into a non-stick skillet over med heat...about 6 minutes total, and tossing if necessary to prevent burning. This is such a critical, flavor-enhancing step and it makes all the difference in the world. I promise. Happy cooking....",

Spray the underside of a crust protector ring with non-stick spray and place it on the unbaked pie before putting the pie in the oven.  Do not remove the ring  until the pie is finished baking.  The crust will still brown nicely while covered.  I do this for all of my quiches and two crust pies.  I make my own rings out of heavy duty foil and they work like a charm.",
