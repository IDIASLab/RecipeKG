I use parchment paper, a rolling pin, a pizza cutter and a 3x5 index card.\r\nWrap a piece of parchment paper around the log.  Roll flat with the rolling pin.  A 3x5 index card makes a nice tool for measuring width. Sprinkle almonds onto dough, press down into dough with parchemnt paper.  Bake on parchement paper and voila! no clean-up. TEN minutes after removing from oven, use pizza cutter to cut strips into diagonals.  Use a good quality ziplock bag to ice cookies.  Put icing in bag, press out air, close and cut a TEENY hole in one corner. Again, no clean-up!",

I doubled the almond extract (I LOVE the smell/taste of almonds...so if you're a big almond fan, I recommend this) and ended up adding an extra egg because my dough wasn't moist enough.  This gave the cookies an even lighter consistancy and REALLY made them melt in your mouth.  I will be making these again soon...thanks for the recipie!",

You have brought a very happy memory to life and if my Norwegian grandmother (who died 30 years ago today not realizing her dream of making me a baker) were alive she'd be doing handstands (at the ripe age of 115). I finally made some MARVELOUS cookies (so marvelous that I forgot to make the icing!)! The icing on the cake (no pun intended) is that they were a staple of our Norwegian family and just the very first recipe that my grandmother tried to teach me. Thank you for the melt-in-your-mouth. almost marzipan recipe. This will become a regular in our household (even without the nuts which hubby can't eat -- I made half with and half without almonds). An added plus is that my Canadian-Irish hubby said that they were \"sex in a cookie\". I had to put them away so that there would be some left for tomorrow. Mange takk Marji!",
