When I reached for the tamarind in the refrigerator I couldn't find it. I ran to the Buzz for substitution ideas. It was suggested that I use molasses and lemon juice. So I added 1 tbsp. molasses and 1 tsp. lemon juice. When putting the lemon juice back in the fridge I saw the tamarind on the door! I went ahead and added it too. Just a little comic relief! Served with brown basmati rice spinach paneer and garlic naan. Fabulous! Thanks Chef John!",

Similarly the blender method means that you can get a smooth sauce without finely chopping anything! The texture of the finished product was excellent - tender and juicy but firm meat in a great deeply flavored sauce. I added half of the cayenne originally and then continued tasting and adding more towards the end to make sure I got the hot I liked. I also added a smidgen of brown sugar to lessen the harshness of the sauce. This is a great company dish because you can do all the prep and shove it in the oven hours before dinner. I served it with a simple roast veggie medley also prepared ahead of time and shoved in the oven 30 min before dinner (while the sauce thickened on the stove top.) and basmati rice with a touch of chicken bouillon and saffron. It s a great gourmet dinner with little fuss when your company is there!",
