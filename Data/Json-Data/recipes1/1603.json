I've found that to take away the \"cake mix\" flavor of the bars, I use a yellow cake mix and add a tablespoon of lemon juice, and a tsp. or so of lemon zest (or lemon extract works well if you don't have fresh lemon zest).  To make these bars a bit prettier, I drizzle them lightly with a powdered sugar/lemon juice glaze, and cut them into diamonds or triangles.",

These were not sweet and sickening and had a wonderful lemon flavor with the zest. The cream cheese layer offset what could otherwise be a very sweet rich bar. I didn't think they tasted like cake mix at all. I would definitely make again. Make sure they are completely cool before cutting. Thanks for the nice recipe.",

These are awesome. So much better than any lemon bar I have ever made and I'm a huge lemon bar fan. So for those of you that are non-believers like me this one rocks. As per other suggestions I did double the filling and added a little extra lemon (juice of two lemons total) Perfect. I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could!!",

Also the amount of lemon juice the recipe calls for makes for a really mild lemony flavor. I would suggest if you like the bars to be lemony increasing the amount of lemon juice.
