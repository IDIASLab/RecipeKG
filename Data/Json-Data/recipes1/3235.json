The dried thyme overpowered the taste of the dish. I may make this again (using fresh spices) but I still have a bad taste in my mouth from the veggies I just made.

I really had never found a good way to roast vegetables that didn't sound complicated (put this veggie in, take this one out, lower the temp, put the oven on broil, stir every 3 minutes...), until now! I took this dish to my brother's house, and they wanted to keep all the leftovers! The only thing I did differently was to omit butternut squash, and up the ratio of balsamic vinegar to olive oil. Oh, I also used salt and pepper in the dressing. I used 1 large red onion, 1 sweet potato, 3 new potatoes, half a bag of baby carrots, grape tomatoes, crimini mushrooms, red bell peppers, zucchini, and I used dried rosemary, thyme and basil (I already had dried) for the seasonings. I did the root vegetables on one foil-lined baking pan, and the more delicate veggies on another pan. I found mine burned after about 15 minutes at 475, so I lowered the temp. to 450 and just cooked longer. With the addition of the time in the oven at 475, the root vegetables took about 45-50 minutes, and the other veggies took about 25-30, stirring both. \nThis recipe tasted SO good, though, and I have gotten requests to make it for holidays and other family gatherings. Thanks for sharing it!  ",

I forwent the sweet potatoes and squash, and don't care for rosemary so omitted those.  Used red potatoes w/skins instead of yukons, and added some fresh broccoli.  The broccoli was to die for roasted!  I kept all measurements the same except had to add a bit more EVOO.  I added some garlic powder(was afraid to add garlic cloves for fear of burning and becoming bitter) and added 1 tsp. basil, 1 tsp. dried crushed thyme.  (didn't have fresh) Fresh cracked pepper and salt at the end.  This is just perfect.  Did it in big roaster pan and just loosely covered w/foil and turned every 10 minutes as stated for the 35 and they still browned while I think that bit of foil just loosely laid overtop helped them 'steam' a bit and no veggie was too crunchy or mushy.  Served w/oven-broiled lamb and baguettes and it was a complete meal.",
