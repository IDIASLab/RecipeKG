I tried once with white sugar and 2 times with confectioner's sugar. Confectioner's sugar is in 99% of fudge recipes - there were a lot of people on here saying their fudge came out grainy, and that would be why! So make sure to use confectioner's, and I've found that 7-8 minutes is the right amount of time for the \"soft ball stage\" to be reached, but you really ought to try it out in a cold glass of water every 30 seconds until it forms little balls in the water. I added a little more peanut butter in my 2nd try as well, maybe 1/8 cup more, and my family definitely liked it better, so if you're a PB stickler like me, add more peanut butter!",

You can also tell the stage with a candy thermometer. This recipe is pretty sweet, but has a nice texture.",

I agree with the othe lady,my grandmother always told me to leave it be as it cooked to. \n\n** Follow the recipe. Add the sugar, cocoa and milk.. Bring it to a slight boil.. Until the endges are boiling.. Turn the heat down and let it cook stirring OCASSIONALY... UNtil a soft ball forms in a seperate cup of cold water. \n\nTake it off of the fire and add 1 tsp of vanilla extract, the butter and peanut butter. (my family loves p3eanut butter so I added a cup to this recipe) stir vigorously until smooth. Then put the WHOLE PAN in a slightly larger pan of COLD WATER.. ( that grainey stuff.. this will stop the crystals from getting bigger) Stir until smooth. This is all a very quick process.  \n\nThen butter your pan, pour in the fudge and place it in the fridge until it's hardened. You guys will love this recipe once you get the hang of leaving it alone to cook. I just got finished making this recipe. It took 20 minutes total and so far it is firming perfectly. \nI hope this helps you all. If you have a question. Email me at Zammada@Aol.com... Thanks, \nCrystal ",

You need to form the proper sized crystals in your fudge to have a creamy texture.  If the crystals are allowed to grow to large, the candy becomes grainy and, if very large, hard and brittle.  You need to stop cooking fudge at the soft ball stage as measured by a properly calibrated thermometer.  If it is a recipe that requires beating, you need to stop as soon as it loses it's gloss; further beating allows crystal growth which changes the texture.\n\nAlso remembering that making any substitutions may change your inhibiting agents and allow crystals to grow larger as well.

I love it, and plan to make it again just as i did. again not bad for a first time make!!!! Jen",
