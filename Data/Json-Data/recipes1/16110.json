Used 1 lb. 99% fat-free ground turkey breasts; 10 oz. diced tomatoes w/ habanero peppers (only use habanero option if you want to spike the heat); lite coconut milk. Eliminated the sesame oil and saut\u00e9ed turkey onion & garlic in Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base. These changes eliminated some fat making it an even healthier version and it s still great tasting. The recipe as written seems to have more turkey than necessary so you may want to decrease the amount or if using the 2 lbs. at least up the garbanzo beans as others have suggested. Thank you Marcia for a fantastic recipe! UPDATE: This has become a repeat winner for us. I now add 1 cup of jumbo mixed raisins when stirring in the garbanzo beans. If you prefer firmer raisins add during last 5 minutes of cooking time.",
