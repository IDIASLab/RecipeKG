However for me the overall effect was a bit bland - I think it just needs something with slightly stronger flavor to punch it up a bit. Maybe adding lemon juice or zest to the mascarpone, or perhaps using dried sour cherries instead of the dates.",

Pears and dates are fantastic together and pair perfectly with the creamy marscapone. The tarragon has a bolder smell than flavor. It has notes of licorice but adds a nice kiss of flavor that I wasn't expecting. I will absolutely make these again. Although next time I'll try to figure out how to make them look cuter.",

I  thought some of the ingredient quantities were a bit off.  I  got way more than 8 slices out of each pear and I  only used 1/4 to 1/2 a date per cracker.   I  did not bother to peel my pears.  The flavor combination was wonderful!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!",
