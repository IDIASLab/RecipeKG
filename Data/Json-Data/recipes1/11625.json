I actually made this last thurs, and I wasn't sure if it was my buds, or if there was a \"taste\" that I just wasn't sure about.  It was the \"taste\" & I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know for a fact that it isn't the filling.  I added water chestnuts to the filling, because I had an extra can starring me in the face.  The roast itself came out very tasty, nice & tender, but if I were to make this again, I would use olive oil (like in the roasted pork loin, from this site) instead of the sauce because that roast came out fantastic!  Use a meat thermometer to ensure proper cooking time & your roast will not be dry.  This would be equally great with pork chops as other have suggested!  Thanks Mariah!",

For my family we added more garlic and some cilantro in the stuffing and more cumin in the sauce.  I also make the sauce several hours ahead so the flavors meld, chill it and then bring back to room temp.  And since I first made this I've learned to double the spinach stuffing mixture.  It is so much better and makes the presentation even more distinct.  I also have been known to add a shot or two of bourbon to the sauce!!!  This is an update - I originally reviewed it years ago and continue to love it and make it often.",

If you want to be brave, I like to mix up a sour creme sauce with some spinach, dijon mustard, crushed thyme, a little black pepper and serve with it.  It really sets it off!\nBTW - I like to take the pork out of the oven at 145 to 150 degrees.  It will finish cooking by the time you serve, and reduce the chances of dry meat!",
