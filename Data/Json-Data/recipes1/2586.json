Instead of using all white flour, I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour.  This gave it more fiber and a better, nuttier taste.  Also, I don't use bread flour in my bread machine.  Unbleached all-purpose flour is good enough for me because if I did have all these different flours, I wouldn't have any room in my cabinets.  Although I don't use bread flour, I do add vital wheat gluten, which is available at supermarkets.  This gives more volume to loaves and a more bread-like texture.  The rule is to add one teaspoon of wheat gluten per cup of flour or one and a half teaspoons per cup of whole grain(or whole wheat)flour.  I hope this tip was helpful for those who may be having trouble with the size of their bread loaves as a result of not using bread flour.  I will be making this bread again soon!",

We still go through a loaf a day (the kids even fight over the crusts!), but we do use 2 1/3 cups of flour not the 2 cups that I originally  wrote the recipe as.  A \"heavy\" tsp. of yeast is nice also.  Will try the butter in place of oil, sounds good. Enjoy!!  Merrilee Bell",

My only problem is that I don't like bread from a bread machine in general - the crust is too thick.

I also have tried several variations that work well and give a different flavor. Try adding seeds or nuts (ie, sunflower, pumpkin, pecans, walnuts). They are delicious. Add them during the second kneed or at the add-in buzzer. Also, you can replace some of the flour (I generally use 1/3-2/3 cup) with either cornmeal or whole wheat flour. I also have replaced the honey with molasses. They all work well and you can mix and match! Enjoy",

Great bread for toasting or sandwiches with a mildly different taste because of the oatmeal. I used a new bread machine which I haven't mastered yet but this recipe came out perfectly on the first try. This will be one to hang on to!",
