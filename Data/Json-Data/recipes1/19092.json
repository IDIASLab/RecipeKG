My only slight change was to use a can of diced tomatos with the chipoltle chilis already added into it instead of buying the cans separately and having so many chipoltle chilis left over. Rotel I think was the brand but not the original Rotel with the green chilis-the can that has chipolte chilis in it. I also would recommend reserving some of the marinade before pouring over the raw meat to drizzel on before eating if you like a bit more of the sauce.
