Garlic increased from 3 to 4 cloves, used only 1 can of tomatoes (use crushed instead of stewed), increased broth to 4 cups, used 1/8 cup fresh chopped basil instead of dried, incrased pasta to 7 oz, added red pepper flakes for a little spice and topped it off with fresh grated parmesan cheese.

It's ridiculously easy, which I thought was kind of funny - I was a little embarrassed how much work I didn't do and how well it turned out!  :o)  Only thing I did differently was use dried parsley and great northern beans rather than cannelini.  Also added another shake of dried basil and a little salt at the end.  Perfect!\n*Update 2/15/08: I have made this countless times now and we love it.  I always use dried parsley rather than fresh now because it actually tastes better that way to us.  One of the best & probably under-rated recipes on this site!",

My dad always made Pasta e Fagioli when I was a kid but he makes his with ground beef and I never really cared much for ground beef (sorry dad)! This recipe was easy and tasted delicious! I used ditalini and boiled it seperately from the rest of the soup and added it when it was still al dente. I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes. This soup is really perfect to use up some of your leftover tomato sauce.. just add the chicken stock and the pasta and beans and you're good to go! This is truly comfort food for me and I recommend trying this! I will definitely be making this again!",
