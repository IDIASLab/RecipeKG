I did try the cake with a chocolate icing recipe from the back of a package: Hershey's Chocolate Cocoa (for baking) and I added choped almonds. After the cake had time to cool the next day that was the end of it. Absolutely delicious. The cake was gone in two days. Some reviews I read suggested that the cake was not so much of a pound cake but more light and springy. If you want more of a pound cake texture just sift the dry ingredients twice where it calls for sifting in the recipe I have tried it that way.",

I did follow another suggestion for a yellow pound cake (different recipe) of creaming the butter shortening and sugar for 25 minutes. I let the butter get to room temperature first. I also added 1 tablespoon and 1/4 teaspoon of vinegar to the milk and allowed to get to room temp to become sour milk as she had suggested is similar to buttermilk. The only difference between the two cakes was that I used regular sugar on this one. Next time I will be using confectioner's sugar instead because it causes the creamed mixture to be more light and fluffy than the granulated sugar. I'm making this cake again for my decorating class:-)",
