I get to control how thick the sauce is this way. This recipe works great on chicken breasts. If you want a faster version that is even better, saute the meat first until it is barely done, then cook in the oven for 25 mins.  Try brining the meat first,it makes the meat tender and flavorful.",

I also could not get the milk and soup to blend and even after baking the sauce was kind of lumpy. It would need to be cooked stovetop to blend I suppose.
