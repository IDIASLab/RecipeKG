I always make very unique Christmas cookies to get the oohs and ahhs and this one really makes a pretty presentation. The cookie texture is delightful and the filling is absolutely delicious. I do add a 1 tsp. of lemon juice to the date mixture as I've seen with other date fillings although I'm not sure what it assists in doing. You don't taste the lemon.",
