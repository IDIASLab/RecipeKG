Saffron is the most expensive spice in the world so why would you cover it up with stronger cheap spices like orange and cinnamon? I also cooked the millet a LITTLE too long...I would suggest slightly under-cooking the millet before you combine with the tofu/wine mixture where it will complete it's cooking. Otherwise you end up with a slightly clumpy slightly soggy mess that I got but that was my fault. If I were to make this again I'd omit the cinnamon and orange and add annatto or achiote for color and light fragrance so as not to cover up the saffron.",
