                "reviewBody": "I have worked as a chef for a few years and I am always keen to try new recipes. I was looking for a new cheese scone recipe. I came across this one and tried it. On the first attempt I was not very impressed. I tried again but changed a few things. I put 6tps (90g butter) like other people recommed. Also the amonut of milk stated was way to much you only need. 2/3 of a cup (175mls). Also I see alot of other people have had problems with the dough being very sticky. It is ment to be quite stick but one you have made the dough. Before flatening and cooking. Put in a bowl and cover with cling film. Put in fridge for 20-30min. This will alow dough to rest and will give flour time to absorb milk. You will end with a scones that are not sogy and the dough will be easier to handle. One final thing The temperature of oven that is stated in recipe if far to high. You should cook at 180c max. If you cook at a lower temperature then it will cook better and the scones will be light with that crubley texture that so many of you are looking for. Rather than sogy and heavy.If you cook at a very high temperature the out side will cook befor the inside and will result in the inside not cooking proberly. after making these ajustments my second batch of scone came out fantastic. They were the best I have tasted.\n\nI hope this helps",

I subbed a romano and asiago blend for the cheese and added some chopped fresh herbs along with the garlic. (I chopped the garlic some fresh rosemary basil parsley and flaked red chilis and cooked them in some olive oil for about a minute in the mike to take some of the bite out of the garlic. This allowed me to use a lot more but keep the mellow yummy garlic flavour instead of the harsh raw garlic flavour.) Oh -and I didn't knead or roll these -too sticky. I wet my hands and rolled them gently into balls flattening them on the greased cookie sheet. My guests couldn't stop eating these -best hot and I served with chunky tomato potato soup from this site.",

As per other reviewers, I used 6 T of butter, and increased the salt to 1/4 tsp.  I put in over 1 cup of cheese (mostly rag-tag ends I had in the refrigerator) and 3 cloves of garlic.  Instead of a cup of milk I used 2/3 cup of fat-free half and half.  I put the flour, BP, salt and butter in the food processor and pulsed it until the butter was well incorporated.  Then I put that mixture in a bowl and added the cheese, garlic and some chopped green onions, then the FF half & half.  The dough was perfect; not too sticky and it kneaded beautifully.  I baked the scones for 20 minutes at 375 and they were wonderful.  Tender and flaky and galicky.  Next time I may add more cheese, though.  Thanks for the great base recipe, ANGG",
