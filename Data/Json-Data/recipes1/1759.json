I used 3 of the smaller boxes of pudding mix with 6 cups of milk. Instead of the frozen topping I made real whipped cream using a pint of heavy cream and just a little sugar. I used only a little over half of the cake and could have done with a little less pudding too. The recipe does say to use a large punch bowl....their not kidding!",
