To add alittle thickness to the soup base one can of cream of chicken soup really did the trick. The biscuits were so light and fluffy but still had great texture and flavor.

For those who thought it a little bland you may have missed the step \"season to taste.\" I omitted cayenne pepper to make it a little more kid-friendly and added kale to the broth with the chicken to make it a one pot meal. Also as per the suggestion of another reviewer I stored the leftover dumplings separately from the soup to preserve the broth & consistency of the dumplings. The recipe is a little time-consuming but most home-made comfort food recipes are. My husband loved it and the kids liked it. Very good!",
