I used one 17 oz bag of Reeces Pieces instead of the m&m's and I used 30 oz of premium white chocolate chips melted in the microwave for the white chocolate. For those who said this was too sweet it's important NOT to use almond bark or \"white chips\" which both are sugary and are not actually white chocolate at all. I also rolled out some parchement paper on the counter top to spread the mixture on. It would not have fit on a cookie sheet. After the mixture dried about 30 minutes I broke it up a bit and stored in container. I'll be making this one again!",

I also send it with my son for his away golf matches on the bus. My original recipe called for 1-1.5 lbs of almond bark not 2! I also use Crispix instead of Chex and use 1/2 cashews and 1/2 pecan halves. Either way it is great.",

Easy. Very easy! I believe whoever took Ruth's recipe and put it on this site copied it incorrectly. Step 2 is just a repeat of Step 1 and is a bit confusing to the reader.
