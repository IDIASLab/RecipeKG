The darker you cook your roux, the deeper the flavor. This may seem like a long time to cook shrimp but it works. In our family it is typically served over hot cooked rice with potato salad on the side.",

The only problem is if you add the shrimp (especially the small ones) this early in the recipe, they'll be over-cooked.  The way I make it is I add the bell pepper and celery when I add the onions...right when the roux is ready.  I also add minced garlic.  I cook the gravy down to where it's pretty thick, then add the shrimp in the last 10 minutes.  The shrimp will throw off water, making the gravy perfect once the shrimp are cooked, which only takes a few minutes.  Right before serving, I add chopped parsley and chopped green onions.  I also don't use black pepper, since it doesn't digest.  I use cayenne instead, and more than what's called for with the black pepper.  Of course, that's an individual preference, but I like mine with a little \"sting.\"  A note to \"sampnik\" regarding the \"bitter taste\"...if it's bitter, you burned your roux.  Try again, and let the roux get the color of a dark peanut butter, and you won't have that bitter taste. :)",

When making it with the children in mind I leave much of the spice out. Garlic was also good added to this. Thank you so much Merwin for Audry's recipe.
