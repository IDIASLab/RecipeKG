Turns out that this recipe is fantastic--you've got this tremendous light texture with a full dose of peanut butter and cream cheese, two things that are usually really heavy.  It just makes for a spectacular contrast that was devoured at our home in, literally, seconds.\n\nI turned this into a low-carb recipe by swapping out the confectioner's sugar for Splenda and making an almond-flour crust with butter and Splenda on the bottom.  I'm figuring a total of less than ten carbs per slice (if divided into eight pieces)--that's marvelous for how good this was.\n\nDon't pass this one up--it's a great recipe, different, and entirely satisfying ;)",
