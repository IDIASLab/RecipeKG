I changed a few things like microwaving the caramel ingredients in a huge bowl and cooling the oven-heated mixture on the cookie sheet I used. Once cooled I just put them in a bowl omitting the wax paper step. The caramel came out smoother and tastier doing it this way. I also added about 1 tsp of cinnamon and about 1/4 tsp vanilla extract to the caramel to give it less of a butter flavor which seemed overwhelming. But everything came together better this time around using this method.",
