The pretzels turned out tasting really stale (I was expecting them to be crunchy) after mixing in the chocolate mixture. Maybe it was because I used the pretzels sticks instead of regular pretzels or maybe that's the way they are suppose to be. I think I will try this recipe one more time and use the regular pretzels and see if that makes a difference.",

I used milk chocolate/peanut butter morsels and fat free sweetened condensed milk. I liked the idea of bits and pieces as opposed to the crushed pretzels (made them look like little chocolate covered bird's nests!)but next time I may try a different shaped pretzel. MUCH easier and quicker than the dipped pretzels I usually do!!! Thanks for the idea!",

I used the regular mini pretzal twists and broke them into smaller pieces (not crushed). I had no butterscotch chips so I used vanilla instead and I did go with the 1/2 cup of peanuts. I certainly agree that this is much easier than the task of dipping pretzals individually. When I make again I will be probably use peanut butter chips and will increase the peanuts even a little more. Thanks for the recipe!!",
