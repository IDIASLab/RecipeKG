I changed it a bit to make it more whole grain. Instead of adding two cups of white rice flour I added one cup of rice flour 3/4 cup of brown rice flour and 1/4 cup of milled flax seed. I put a tablespoon of sugar instead of sucanat. I put foil over the muffins after 15 minutes so the top of the muffins wouldn't brown too much. The muffins stuck to the paper muffin cups so next time I'll just grease the muffin pan well and skip the paper muffin cups.",
