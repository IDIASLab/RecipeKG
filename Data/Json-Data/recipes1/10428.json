The water tends to swell when it freezes, and the  package could burst, leading to a big mess. Simmering is also a terrible idea when dealing with plastic. So, if you have a plastic package, which tofu often comes in, remove it from the package, slice it, and freeze it in a freezer bag, then remove and simmer.",

Frieda's is packaged in a plastic container though and I didn't feel good about simmering it so the first time I dumped the frozen tofu in a bowl and microwaved it and it was really good. The second time I used Extra Firm Tofu (same brand) and thawed it in the refrigerator in the original container. The Extra Firm was even better. It drained well and soaked up a lot of the sauce it was cooked in. MUCH better than tofu straight from the package.",

I used it with The Honey Mustard Tofu recipe also on this site and it was really good. I've also used this technique sliced the tofu dipped it in flour browned it on both sides then poured BBQ sauce in the skillet and it was really good. I imagine you could use this technique to make \"mock chicken\" and use any type of sauce you might normally use on chicken breasts. This opens up a lot of recipe ideas.",
