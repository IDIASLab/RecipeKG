I think this really helps the consistency of the rice. Most of the recipes for spanish rice result in a wet mushy mess. I like it dry and loose like the restaurants. I don't measure anything, I just make sure the liquid covers the rice, and I've started using salsa instead of tomatoes - just enough to give it some color - and I season it with Taco Seasoning I from this site (about a tablespoon of it). It comes out restaurant quality, love it!!",
