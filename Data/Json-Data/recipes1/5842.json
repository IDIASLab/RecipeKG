My brother and I took this on our cross-country trip and ate some every day for 5 days straight and didn't get tired of it!  \r\n\r\nThe key to getting that hummus taste out of the black bean is the tahini.  If you don't use tahini, you may as well just have some refried beans from your local Mexican restaurant.\r\n\r\nThis is also an easy recipe to vary with other ingredients.  Just remember that if you're going to add different spices, use fresh ones!  There is no substitute!",

The texture was good, the flavor was excellent. The PB is not discernible, and for me, going to the effort of driving an hour to purchase tahini defeats the whole purpose of making such a delicious dish with most ingredients available at all times in my refrigerator and pantry. We toasted tortilla triangles and cut pitas into wedges and broiled them crips. DELISH. Thank you!!",

I made my own tahini for this and I can't taste it that much. All the better; I am not a big fan of tahini. I'm a little puzzled by the complaints that it isn't pretty. It's not beautiful I agree but if you garnish it correctly it looks fun and the purple color isn't bad. I've certainly made food that looks a lot less appetizing! Thanks for the recipe!",
