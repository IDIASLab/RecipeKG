He knows what I am making from the very start. After that anytime I get the container from the fridge he goes bananas. He just can't wait till he gets a piece. I bought special bowls to store it in and a medium size chopper. I can never thank you enough for this great recipe. Thank you thank you and thank you over and over again.",
