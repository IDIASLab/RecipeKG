Also we didn't have any butter beans so I used an equivalent amount of cooked mashed lentils instead. After trying it both ways (lentils vs. butter beans) everyone liked the lentils much better! I also added a little diced green pepper and that REALLY enhanced the flavor and I omitted the jalapeno pepper (don't like spice). I make this recipe ALL THE TIME and we never get tired of it!!!!!!!!!!!",

Others complained that the recipe yielded \"mushy\" burgers; perhaps it was BAKING them, instead of frying them as directed in the instructions.  These reviews are without merit.\n\nI encourage you to try the recipe as it in its orignal form.  I have made this several times following the directions.  Friends, family and I and enjoy it tremendously.   If you follow the recipe exactly as it is provided, you'll find a flavorful vegetarian burger that is slightly crispy on the outside and moist in the center.   I think you'll like it.",
