You should have golden brown wings that are well done (that's the way we enjoy them anyway) second Red Hot pepper sauce usually makes the best sauce. I only add as much butter as needed depending on the heat you're looking for. More heat = less butter. If you are really looking for REALLY HOT wings cook your RED HOT pepper sauce until reduceded by about a third. You will then LOVE the heat it brings on. And one other thing DO NOT add any vinegar to this recipe and be sparing with the salt. Any pepper sauce you use will have more that enough vinegar already as well as sodium. PS I've been making these for 15 years and have never had one person not love them.",

                "reviewBody": "I didn't try this recipe yet, but in the creator's defense, I think there has been a misunderstanding. Reviewers are complaining the recipe wasn't hot (spicy) enough.  Where the recipe submitter states to use \"2 teaspoons hot pepper sauce\", I believe she is referring to McIlhenny's Tabasco sauce, which is nearly 10 X hotter than Frank's REDHOT.  Any chef worth her salt in the kitchen knows that peppers (and their derivatives, i.e. hot sauce)  have a heat rating scale varying from zero (red bell pepper) to 16 million (Pure capsaicin and Dihydrocapsaicin).  Frank's REDHOT rates 450 units on the heat scale; McIlhenny's Tabasco rates 2,500-5,000 units; therefore Tabasco is roughly 5-10 times hotter than Frank's.  If so inclined, try the recipe again, and make the adjustments, either use Tabasco as the recipe is written @ 2 tsp., or use 5-10 times the Frank's (2 teaspoons X 5-10, anywhere from 3.5 to 7 Tablespoons, which is nearly 1/2 cup Frank's).  Add slowly to taste.  I realize the cooking levels and knowledge of participants on this site varies as much as the pepper ranking scale, so let's cut each other a bit of slack and work together to share some fantastic recipes, Allrecipes cooks!  Cheers!",
