I think the addition of some blue cheese to the cream cheese mixture would be awesome. They are a little fussy to make and if I were making them for a large group I would use my pasta roller to flatten the bread and then probably cut the bread in half. They were pretty filling and although tasty they are more of a side dish than a appetizer as written. There is no need to blanch the asparagus. 10 minutes at 400 - 425 perfect and you will have tender but not mushy asparagus.",

Super easy to do - soften the cream cheese mix the ingredients and spread on the bread add asparagus and roll up. Brush with butter sprinkle with cheese bake 10 min. My bread didn't dry out at all I used about half the amount of butter called for and I forgot the lemon. I also rolled them on the diagonal and cut them in half before serving. Delish!",
