AMAZING results!",

The author left out one important word in the ingredient list, and that would be JARRED. Or canned. I had only purchased fresh chestnuts previously and didn't realize until the moment that I was about to begin preparations, at 4:00 the evening before Thanksgiving, that I was meant to have bought precooked chestnuts. Boiling and peeling the little buggers by hand easily added another hour and a half to my prep time. I was not a happy camper. Should have just run to the store to buy some, but was afraid on the night before t-giving, there wouldn't be any left. Arrrgh. Also, good luck finding the marrons glace. I live in a big city and went to 3 stores that carry specialty items - no dice, so we did without. I'm sure it would have been fabulous with them. Give this a try but you may have to order the candied chestnuts online.",
