I used this recipe for our \"mexican night\" and my brother made the authentic triple sec lime juice tequila margarita and everyone like these much better. I did use the lime to moisten the rim of the glass before the salt. I have been even keeping the leftovers in the blender glass in the freezer and whenever I want a margarita I just pop it back on the blender base and enjoy one anytime.",
