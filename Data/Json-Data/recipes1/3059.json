I then put the cooked sausage over that. (Bob Evans Spicy Hot Sausage from Kroger) I then put 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese over that. Then I pour the egg/half and half/green onion mixture over that.\n\nI bake after letting it sit in the fridge for 8-12 hours at 350 degree for 25 minutes.\n\nI guess I should post a new recipe!!",

This past weekend was my daughters high school prom and our house ended up being the \"after party\".  I put out a spread for them including this casserole.  The kids raved about it! My daughters bf asked me when I was going to make it again! So...I will be making it again this weekend! LOL! I do make a few changes that I have picked up on here. I use the Jimmy Dean Maple Sausage, 6 eggs (I think I am going to try 8 next time), 1 1/2 Cups milk (I think I am going to try the full 2 Cups next time), I don't think I am going to use additional salt next time b/c I feel it is salty enough from the sausage and cheese. I use the mild cheddar, but I use 1 box of Marie Callendar Cheddar/Garlic croutons instead of the bread and that adds to the cheesy flavor. And I add a little bit more of the dried mustard. It is an excellent breakfast casserole!",

I am not a big egg person but this I would eat again.  \r\n\r\nI'd bought the wrong type of sausage... so I figured I'd just squeeze it out of the casing to brown, then when I went to do that I found out it was PRECOOKED!  Not a problem at all.  I just popped the precooked (beef) sausage into my Ultimate Chopper and gave it a few zaps, saved a ton of time and mess!  \r\n\r\nI had this thing whipped together in just a few minutes.  I did increase the bread to 8 slices, cheese to 3 cups and reduced the milk to 1 cup...didn't want to take any chances of anything being \"runny or slimey\".  Added a chopped onion according to other suggestions.  The 8 slices of bread may have been a bit much for some... it was pretty thick but I think I'll stick with it as it turned out so well.  Nothing worse than slimey eggs!  \r\n\r\nOh and I had put this in my lazagna pan, so cut the servings the way I would a lazagna.  The left overs I wrapped in the Press-n-Seal wrap in single serving sizes and put them in the freezer.  The next morning we just popped one in the microwave for 1 minute, turned out just as good as the first day.  Would be good to do a pan of this up and cut the whole thing up in single serve slices to freeze for those need a good breakfast quick mornings.",

I doubled the recipe, and as the author suggested, I used 1 lb breakfast sausage and 1 lb sage.  Didn't have mustard powder so used yellow mustard.  I also used whole milk and added hredded potatoes.  By accident, I didn't toast the bread.  I am so glad I didn't because this turned out this was the most moist and fluffy this casserole has ever been.  If you fear this will be dry, do NOT toast the bread first.  I love this recipe and it is a Christmas morning tradition for us now.
