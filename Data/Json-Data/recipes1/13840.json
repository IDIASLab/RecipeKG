I also served with fresh guacamole for topping, YUM!! Based on all the great reviews, I went ahead and put together an extra casserole to freeze for later, and I'm so glad I did!",

I omitted the chili pepper and cayenne pepper because I knew the taco seasoning would give it enough heat plus I planned on using a medium heat salsa. I also used bell pepper, red onion, and green chillies in with the ground beef until they began to sweat.\nI added some taco sauce into the salsa for additional flavor but was mindful in using mild taco sauce. I also added some white pepper to the meat as well to counteract the salt in the packaged taco seasoning.\nNext time I go to make it ... and I will be making it again! I plan on mixing the sour cream into the beef mixture once the beef is cooked. It seems to me that it would make more sense and make it easier if I just stirred the sour cream into my beef mixture for easier layering and to get a better consistency of the sour cream.\nI used 8\" flour tortillas for a 9x13\" baking dish and to aide in layering and to give it better layering I did fold some in half placing the straight edges along the pan. \nI placed a dallop of sour cream on the side once it was ready to be served and cut up some fresh chives and garnished the sour cream with the chives. And then served up a fresh side of corn bread muffins.\nI plan on also trying this with chicken. I think it would taste just as well if not better!!!\nMy husband said it was like a big juicy taco and my daughter actually gave me a big hug telling me thank you for such an awesome meal :O)",

I took the suggestion of another reviewer and did mine in a round pan so that I only needed 1 tortilla per layer. But make sure your pan is deep enough or otherwise use two pans. I used flour tortillas instead of corn simply because my family isnt a fan of the corn ones. I also blended two heaping tablespoons of cream cheese into the sour cream to add a bit of sweetness to the dish!! And of course top it with tons of cheese!! DELICIOUS!!! Also a good dish to assemble ahead and freeze for a super quick dinner on another night!",
