The next 2 times I used confectioners sugar in a layered chocolate cake with buttercream frosting (for a birthday party & a cake for home). They were well recieved as well.

I decided to try this recipe because i am doing a wedding cake soon and i needed a fluffy whipped chocolate moose filling but i didnt want cream in it i was worried about it going sour while the wedding cake set out all day. after i added the additional powder sugar I added about 1/4 cup cocoa powder and it made it awesome!!!! so thats why i gave this 5 stars only if its chocolate.",

Since so many complained of the shortening taste I chose increase the butter and decrease the shortening to about a 65/35 ratio as opposed to 50/50. I also used regular sugar which I turned into powder in my mini processor because I wanted the sweetness but not the grainyness. Excellent vanilla is important and I used the white kind which gave me pure white filling. I had some open evaporated milk in the fridge which I think was to old so I used vanilla flavored coffee cream because I didn't want to use milk and that's all I had. The end result was quite nice and I used it to pipe into the center of my blond two bite brownies which sank in the center while cooling. So thanks for the starter recipe. Update:I made this again and used the evaporated milk called for and I hated it. The flavor from t he evap. milk was overpowering and it made the whole thing very smooth a creamy but not in a good way. I seemed to bring out the greasy shortening taste. I have since lowered my rating from a 4 to a 2 star recipe. Stick to sweetened cream and maybe that will work like the coffee cream did for me the first time.",

I have to admit that I must have read the 1/2 cup sugar about four times before actually trusting it (because I thought it was calling for confectioner's sugar) but I went ahead with the white sugar we use daily and hoped for the best BUT the key here to remember is To cream your butter for five (5) minutes then when you add the sugar and shortening and evaporated milk FOR ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES LADIES AND GENTS THIS HERE IS THE KEY TO THIS MOST PHENOMENAL cake filling. This is not explained in the short recipe but the key to your success in making this frosting that people will indeed rave about! Hope this helps.",
