I made it for a holiday party but it didn't get eaten because there weren't many asparagus-eaters so I brought it to another gathering the next day and we ran out and had people asking for more and for the recipe! It was great....and that was as leftovers. I modified the recipe to include fresh asparagus instead of canned Cheese-its instead of saltines (as one other reviewer suggested) and cream of asparagus instead of mushroom. I think it provides a lot of flexibility for improvising based on what's in the cabinets. Thanks for the recipe!",
