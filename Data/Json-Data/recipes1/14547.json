They're even more scrumptious with a small side of plain yogurt with some mint and cumin stirred into it. Add rice or couscous and a green salad and you have a tasty, easy, somewhat elegant dinner! This recipe can also be used to make meatballs for frying, if you prefer.",

The only change I made was to add about 1 tbsp. of paprika in order to give the juice a more 'red' color as I was trying to get something close to what we eat when we go to our favorite Turkish restaurant. The flavor was excellent! Next time I think I will spice them more liberally since we are spicy food people but really the (amount of) spices called for in the recipe worked very well. We will definintely make these again!",

I added an egg to help hold everything together. Also instead of the curry powder I added paprika, adding a nice smoky flavor. I added 2 minced mushrooms as well because they needed to be used and they give the patties a nice texture and I think they helped keep them moist on the inside. I served these with couscous with toasted pine nuts and I wilted some spinach and cabbage in the pan I cooked the patties in and it gave the greens a really nice flavor. ",

We broiled it because we're doing a specific diet where we can't fry things and we live in upstate NY so grilling is pretty much out of the question this time of year. It still came out really yummy. Be sure to add salt and pepper before cooking or it'll be a little bland and you'll have to add it later. Served it on a plate with modified Avocado Tzatzi sauce (recipe on this site) brown rice and leftover savory butternut squash. Awesome meal.",
