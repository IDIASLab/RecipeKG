The only problem I ran into with this reduced amounnt of liquid was the inability to stir the fudge at all! So I added the remaining 1/4  of a cup. I didn't find this too strong.. guess it is personal preference. I am sure this will go over well at tomorrow's St. Patrick's Day party at work. Yes it does make more than an 8X8 pan. I also filled a loaf pan with the fudge. I lined both pans with foil and when the fudge was set, it was easy to cut.. just remove from pan lifting the foil.. and slice. Easier than trying to cut in the pan.  Update - this time I melted the chocolate in the microwave. MUCH easier and you don't have the worry of the chocolate seizing up on you as has happened to me before with a double boiler. Just dump the chocoalate and butter in microwave safe bowl, micro on high for like 45 seconds each time, give it a stir and then pop back in until it is almost completley melted. Stirring the chocoalte will get the last few bits to melt jsut fine.",

It set in the freezer in less than an hour and the people at the dinner party I attended devoured it.

I used all milk chocolate for the top.  I used a few reviewers suggestion not use the full cup of Irish Cream (because they said all Irish Cream made it taste too strong).  I used 3/4 cup Irish Cream, and 1/4 cup of half and half, and found this made the Irish Cream flavor rather mild (even after a day or two).  Also, since previous reviewers said that it made such a thick fudge, I used two(2) 8x8\" pans.  It made a fudge that was just shy of 1\" thick, which was the perfect thickness.  It was good; I would try this again, but I think I will use the full 1 cup of Irish Cream next time, and make sure I have white chocolate chips next time. :)",
