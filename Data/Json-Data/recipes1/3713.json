We're garlic lovers in our family so I added one more clove I also added 1/2 a chopped green pepper. I cut back on the butter and used 3/4 cup 10% cream and 3/4 cup milk to cut back the fat content of the recipe. It was still great and the sauce was thick enough. I think next time I might add a little parmesan or mozzerella cheese to it just before taking the sauce off the stove.",

Instead of fresh mushrooms I used canned used penne pasta in place of fettucine and plain evaporated milk for the cream. It was still wonderful.

I used 1 cup heavy whipping cream and 1/2 cup milk used a garden style spaghetti sauce (with mushrooms and green peppers) and 1 1/2 tsp of oregano parsely and basil.

Next time the recipe will be doubled and in addition to the ham I will add some cooked cubed chicken some shrimp and perhaps even some sun-dried tomatoes. THANKS Chris and Carolyn!",

In my non-stick sauce pot, I saute the ham (2 cups diced)first to render a lot of the fat then I drain off most of the fat and saute the onions and garlic.  Then I use 2 cups of Pasta sauce, 1 cup half-n half and 1 cup skim milk.  Just these modifications alone will cut your calories almost in half.",

Next time and there will be a next time I'll use just 1/4 ts. of crushed red pepper instead of a whole one. We cut the mushrooms smallish which seemed to work nicely. I used leftover ham instead of deli slices and kind of julienned it but smaller and the pieces was too big. The ham and mushrooms really need to diced or they don't work well with the pasta. I also put diced tomatoes on top of the sauce after everything was dished up. Overall great dish. Fairly easy to make a little longer prep and cooking time than what is listed. I will definitely be making this again just with less crushed red pepper.",

I used fresh parsley so keep the measure the same. I purchase Fanestil Party Ham that the butcher sliced thin for me and I coarsely chopped it. I only used 1 cup cream. It was SO good!
