I think next time I will try adding some shredded cheese in the last step or stir some into a hot bowl of soup for an added kick.\r\n\r\nI did find that this recipe takes much longer to prepare than the recipe states.  The times listed in the preparation are assuming you're starting out with peeled/diced potatoes, chopped onions, chopped celery, etc.  If you have none of this prepared ahead of time (and who does?) then this recipe will take much longer to make.  Sure, it's worth the time it takes to make it...but don't use this recipe for as last-minute dinner when you're in a hurry or when you're really tired and just wanting a good soup.  It took me about two hours to make this from start to finish.\r\n\r\nThe cooking of the potatoes in the middle of the recipe before the stock is added is an excellent step and it helps the potatoes cook much faster than they would have just by boiling alone.  The puree step at near the end is very important.  It highly affected the texture and flavor of the soup.  Don't skip that step!\r\n\r\nAlso, please don't think that \"chicken broth\" and \"chicken stock\" are the same thing.  They're not!  I wasn't able to find chicken stock at Walmart, I had to go to Albertsons.  If you use chicken broth you'll get a much different result.\r\n\r\nI also noticed this recipe has no salt added.  I did find adding salt to my bowl of soup helped the flavor even more.  I suggest adding some salt!\r\n\r\nI hi",

Back to the stove top it went; added chicken boullion to give the soup more complexity and depth, extra garlic, white pepper (better with cream bases than black pepper), leeks, celery, garlic salt, tsp of hot pepper sauce, dried parsley and a tad bit more tarragon.  Didn't need to puree the soup as the potatoes melted away.  Ultimate potato soup with additions!",

It is a bit involved and time consuming (don't believe the prep or cook times posted here), but it was sooo worth it!  I added carrot and used chicken broth.  Yes, stock is better, but if you don't have it handy, broth works just fine.  If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll know I'm a fan of red potatoes, skin on; use them in this recipe as well!  In step 3 skip the pur\u00e9e part.  It's a needless mess and complication!  Near the end, when the potatoes are soft, simply mash it about 4 to 5 times with a masher and achieve the same results, without the time, mess and added cleanup.  Top with your favorite grated cheese, sliced green onion and some crumbles of the bacon you've set aside.  Enjoy!",
