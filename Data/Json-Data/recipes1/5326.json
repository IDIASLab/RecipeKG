I really wanted it to work, not only for myself but for others who might want to try it, and I believed it definitely had potential in spite of its problems, mainly that 2 cups of sugar to an 8-oz. can of pineapple is just simply far too much. I made this as a 3-layer cake, using the cake mix called for (I used French Vanilla) and a Cake Mix Extender recipe from another web site. Turned out moist, tall, and delicious. For the filling I heated a 20 oz. can of pineapple with just 1/3 cup sugar and 2 T. cornstarch till thickened, then swirled in 2 T. butter to make it silky and rich--again, perfect. Delicious and just the right amount of sweetness. Because of the size of the cake I made, and because I added some decoration, I made a double recipe of the frosting. I decorated the finished cake with sliced almonds, maraschino cherries and wedges of dried pineapple. All I gotta say is, Elvis would be proud this is his namesake. This is one, fine cake, and a real show stopper!",

I used the 20 oz. can of pineapple with juice with a scant one cup of sugar. Honestly you could get away with a half to 3/4 cup--but I wonder if it would make enough \"juice\"? With the cup of sugar it was still very sweet. THEN-I took a big meat fork and covered the cake with holes-a very important step I think. Now apply pineapple liberally. Those steps where suggestions from other reviewers. I changed the frosting to a POUND of cream cheese 1/2 cup butter a running-over teaspoon of vanilla and only 2 cups of powdered sugar. I really like cream cheese frosting obviously. I used all but one cup of it--I just couldn't bring myself to use all of it! Don't mix the pecans into the frosting--it will tear up your cake. TOAST your pecans and sprinkle them on top. Put it in the fridge and serve cold. Yum yum yum!!!",

I used a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple, this gave a better covering of the caked.  I also used just 3/4 cup of sugar to cooked the pineapple in.  2c. sugar is unnecessary.  All you want the sugar to do is to more or less cook the pineapple down and give it a glaze.  Then I used a slotted spoon to drain the liquid off as I was spreading it on the cake.  Doing this will still give you the necessary moisture.  I also sprinkled the nuts on top of the frosting instead as per instrustions, this gave it a nice appearance.  Will I make it again?  YOU BET ON IT!  It had my husband howling with delight!",

I used almost 3 cups confectioner's sugar for the frosting (which was good), and 1 cup for the pineapple mixture (of which I used a 20 ounce can per other reviewers- but I don't think it needed the sugar, and the juice needs to be drained- makes the cake too soggy). I ground up the pecans in my food processor and mixed them in with the frosting and then sprinkled a little on top of the finished cake. That worked out great- the frosting was the best part, IMHO, and it was a beautiful presentation.  I would give it five stars because it's a great mix of ingredients, it just will take some work to get them to my liking. I think just the cake and the frosting would be great too, without the pineapple, and it would make the process easier.  Also, I made the cake mix with whole eggs instead of just egg whites. It's a very good recipe, overall.",
