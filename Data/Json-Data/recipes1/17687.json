I used ground beef and mixed veg, omitting rosemary and cinnamon, as they seemed more suited to lamb than beef. After tasting the beef mix, I wanted to boost the beefy flavor, so added 2 teaspoons beef base. Perfect flavor! I was worried that the beef mix was too thick, but after baking it was just right. I might add more cheese to the potatoes next time, or even toss some in with the beef. The bones of this recipe are great, producing a perfect pie that holds together but isn't dry at all. It could be easily adapted to other cuisines, using Mexican spices and topping with cornbread, or using soy sauce, Hoisin sauce and wasabi mashed potatoes for Asian flair.  Finally, a really, really good gluten-free casserole! Thanks, Chef.  And thanks for a new trick to remove oil from ground meat. I'll never try to drain hot oil again!",

The potato topping was to die for - the Dubliner cheese (as opposed to a regular cheddar) added an amazing distinctive flavor. \u00a0 If you use another meat and a different cheese, it's probably still really good, \u00a0but those changes would turn this recipe into something else completely.",

I also added chopped celery and fresh carrots(note be sure to either cut fresh carrots really small or cook them before hand).I also suggest draining some of the grease from the pan after browning the meat. I think my favorite part of this recipe is the Dubliner cheese it made the potatoes really unique!! Made this for St. Patrick's Day and I will definately make it again though my husband told me it better not be a whole year before we have it for dinner again!! THANK YOU FOR SHARING!!",
