I did make a few minor adjustments based on feedback from a friend of mine who made it.  I cheated and used a Keebler chocolate crumb crust (something I rarely do but was pressed for time).  I decreased the sugar to 3/4 c and increased the whipping cream to 1.5 c to make it a little fluffier.  I also popped it in the freezer for a few hours before serving.  Wow!!!  I'll certainly be making this again and again and again....well, you get the picture! :-)",

There are a lot of similar peanut butter pie recipes, but the differences in this one pay off in a big way \u2013 a homemade rather than purchased cookie crust and real, fresh whipped cream rather than \u201cfrozen whipped topping.\u201d  All are easy to make but the couple of extra steps it takes to use these higher quality ingredients are worth it.  This is a dessert for serious dessert and/or peanut butter lovers.  Thick and rich (but not overly sweet), a little goes a long way.  Yet no sooner do you finish it and you\u2019re already thinking about your next piece!  A garnish is pretty \u2013 chopped peanuts perhaps, mini chocolate chips, crushed cookie crumbs or, as I did, a drizzle of chocolate syrup and some chopped peanut butter cups. Be careful not to overdo it, however!  The pie is so rich that any more than a sprinkle to dress each slice up would be serious overkill!  Because you\u2019ll cut the slices small, one pie will serve quite a few people! Hubs and I only have two more days in Naples to eat this before we head back home, but I know my plan to have the remaining pie waiting for us in the freezer when we return in a couple of weeks will work out very nicely. Note: For those familiar with the famous peanut butter pie from the Old Ebbitt Grill in Washington D.C. - Hubs said this is \"unequivocally better.\"",

I whipped the cream in my stand mixer, put it onto a different bowl,  the heck out of the cream cheese/butter/sugar/PB mixture until it was incredibly light and fluffy, then folded in the whipped cream. It was SO light. \n\nI can think of all kinds of things to do with this. Adding some melted chocolate or white chocolate chips and folding them in, or a tablespoon of chocolate syrup. Or better yet, swirling in some chocolate syrup with a butter knife to create pretty patterns. Adding a tablespoon of chocolate liqeur, chopping up some peanuts and adding them to the crust, using crushed peanut butter cookie crumbs along with the chocolate ones (or doing a layer of each) ... and so on. \n\nThis is going into my \"favourites\" recipe box for sure.

Being an experienced baker, I should have seen this before I started mixing - but it was late and I wasn't really thinking clearly.  Instead, I ended up with a greasy mess.  You can't just throw the filling ingredients in a bowl at once and expect it to come out right.  First of all, the butter is completely unnecessary. The cream cheese & sugar should be beaten together first, then the peanut butter gradually incorporated.  Even at that, I think this would turn out better using at least baker's sugar - which is a much finer grain - if not confectioners sugar.    That is exactly what I ended up doing after trashing the first attempt and starting over.  It came out very smooth and creamy. For poorly written directions, I can give it only three stars instead of the 4 or 5 that it might otherwise deserve.",
