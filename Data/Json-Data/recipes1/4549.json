I know, I know, shame on me!  I am only doing so as I had items in the fridge that I needed to use up!  Based on other reviews, I added the garlic and onion powder, parsley and 1/4 tsp of Old Bay seasoning to the mix.  In place of the water, I used buttermilk which makes a more flavorful biscuit.  As soon as the biscuits were done, I brushed the butter mixture (plus chives for color) on top of the biscuits and popped them back into the oven for about 2 minutes.  Full of flavor, easy to make with ingredients usually found in any cooks kitchen!  5 Stars!",

I followed other reviewers advice and doubled the cheese (about 1 cup) as well as adding 1 tsp. of garlic, 1/4 tsp. onion powder and about 1/2 tsp. of dried parsley to the biscuit batter.  In the butter, I added the called for amounts of garlic and onion powder, increased the parsley to 1/2 tsp (love the color and flavor) and omitted the salt.  I used baking spray rather than parchment paper and took advice from another reviewer and brushed the biscuits with the butter and popped them back in the oven for a few minutes.  Next time I will most likely increase the amount of garlic a bit and maybe make 1/2 a batch as these are hard to resist (I don't believe it's very kind to my waist line!)

They were SO easy and tasted SO much like the restaurant ones I couldn't believe it.  I didn't think that I was going to be able to survive until November when I come back over - but now with my recipe on hand - I'll be making these all the time.  My family also LOVED them and they have never had real American biscuits although my sister swore they were the same as a scone - I don't think so at all.  The only time consuming aspect of this recipe was the fact that I had to make my own Bisquik because we don't have it in Australia - luckily I had shortening on hand from my American Food Store.  Australians need to revise some of our cooking products that are seriously lacking.  AMERICAN FOOD ROCKS.\r\nTip:  dip your biscuits in French dressing - there's nothing better!!!!!!!\r\n\r\nKat Thomas, Melbourne Australia",

But these were goooood.  So easy to make there really is no reason not to make them, and often.  I played with the recipe a bit, but without disturbing its integrity.  I used milk instead of water and a Danish Dill Havarti instead of cheddar (mainly for practical reasons, since I didn\u2019t want the milk to go to waste and the Havarti for the same reason).  In keeping  with the dill already in the Havarti, I swapped  the parsley out  for even more dill weed in the melted butter mixture.  I deliberately made these oversized, planning ahead to use them for some breakfast sandwiches in the morning.  They\u2019re just  delicious \u2013 golden and crusty on the outside, soft and tender on the inside.  Loved \u2018em.",
