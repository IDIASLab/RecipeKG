Also I did not cook the garlic for the marinade and I marinaded for 1 day. In order for your eggplant to come out perfectly remember to sweat the eggplant first then it will shed its water and absorb marinade much better. The peanut sauce is super good. There was a lot left over so I added a little water to thin out slightly and mixed the leftover sauce in with some hot cooked egg noodles and topped with soy sauce and sriracha. You can cut up any leftover eggplant and mushrooms and add to the pasta too.",
