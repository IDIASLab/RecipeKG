I tasted the mixture and it seemed abit dull. i added about 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt. I always put a little salt on my cranberry sauce anyway and it helped put a little zing in the flavor. I used one of those pre-made Boboli-style crusts. I did everything else by the recipe. It had a nice consistency and surprisingly the cheese worked well with the sauce mixture. I could totally see myself making this again though unless you have the leftover squash/pumpkin and cranberry sauce you'll need to find something to do with what's left in the open cans of cranberry sauce and pumpkin. The salt helped but it still needs something. Certainly unusual relatively inexpensive and well worth trying.",
