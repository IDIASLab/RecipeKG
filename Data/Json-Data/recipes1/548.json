I did not chill the dough, I baked it right out of the mixer bowl. My cookies were on the bigger size--I packed my cookie scoop quite full. Mine were done baking at 11 minutes. I let them cool on the cookie sheet for a couple minutes before pulling them off with the spatula and letting them cool on the kitchen counter. These turned out just as chocolate chip cookies should.

I had to make a couple substitutions because I didn't have walnuts on hand but instead had almonds. Because I put the almonds in I threw about 1 1/2 tsp. orange extract into the batter along with the vanilla and a little additional salt (about 1/2 tsp) for some flavor. Everyone loved them. I think that because of the lack of flavor in the shortening it allowed the orange to really come through and the texture of shortening cookies is completely different than those made with butter (I'd never made shortening cookies before). These remind me more of a scone... sort of dry and crumbly but so good with coffee or tea!",
