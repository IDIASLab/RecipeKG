I told my husband that I was making meatloaf, he was grumpy about it until he tasted it and kept saying \"this is good, this is sooo good\" He even took the rest of it to work for lunch(it was half of the meatloaf!)lol. I made this as is, except i used honey ham, and provolone and it was GREAT.  Loved it. I did top it with a ketchup and brown sugar glaze though, it was sooo wonderful and juicy, Oh and make sure you roll it out first on sprayed plastic wrap, it helps you guide the meat better.  Also make sure you close the sides VERy well, so the cheese doesnt ooze out! loved it, NOW THATS A MEATLOAF~~~",

Just wanted to say that it is best to leave an inch around the edges of the meat and put the rectangle of hamburger on a larger sheet of foil and use it to roll the loaf into a cylinder. Be sure to press the ends together well to prevent cheese from oozing out, as well as the long seam. I usually bake in a broiler pan on the foil, punching some holes in the foil so the fat can drip down. Can melt mozzarella cheese wedges on top the last 5 minutes of baking time. Hope this helps.",

Also I used 1 lb. ground sirloin because it's a leaner cut. So the resulting change was 1 lb. of ground turkey mixed with 1 lb. of ground sirloin instead of 2 lbs. of ground beef. I also cut the cooking time to 1 hour. If using turkey like I did the cooking time could possibly be cut down to 50 to 55 minutes since the turkey cooks much faster than beef. Next time I make this I might add a tomato based sauce on top.",

Most likely the meat was pink from the nitrates (or nitrites) in the cooked ham tranfering to the hamburger. This has happened to me when I have made this recipe; but if you check a cross-section I think you will find that the flavor and texture are fine. That is why ham is pink!",

However I used turkey in place of the beef (we're trying to limit red meats ) tripled the Parmesan and switched out the oregano for 1 Tb basil the flavor of which we far prefer. Before rolling with the cheese and ham I placed fresh basil leaves on top of the cheese then rolled. Served atop a nest of fresh home made linguine bathed in a fresh tomato-basil sauce and passed more sauce to put over the meatloaf. Truly a memorable meal.",
