Since then I've made it for another baby shower and a wedding luncheon people asking me for the recipe each time. I double this recipe using more cheddar and less sour cream and cream cheese (1 1/2 cups sour cream 1 1/2 packages cream cheese) than it asks for and put it in a large bread bowl. I think what makes this so great is the salsa. If you don't have a really high quality salsa it just won't turn out right. I go to the On the Border (mexican restaurant) and buy fresh salsa from the restaurant. It makes a HUGE difference and the result is amazing. I always serve with cut up baguettes I don't like how it tastes with tortilla chips. I also increase my oven time to 2-3 hours when I double it and it comes out perfect after a little stirring halfway through. I highly recommend! It's one of my husband's favorites no more rotel and velveeta for us! Thanks for the recipe Julie!",

I didn't want to take a layered dip (good thing - someone else did) and this was perfect. I used a 1lb loaf but doubled the dip. When the dip ran low I spooned in the dip that hadn't fit in the bread bowl (had heated it in the oven in a pie plate.) I served this on a big wooden platter with the torn-out bread and Fritos Scoops sprinkled around it. I'd been skeptical about baking this 1.5 hours but after doubling the dip it needed at least that. Next time I will double it again but use a 2lb loaf (more bread to dip). The dip is yummy and goes fast.",

I used homemade salsa and reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream. Instead of making it inside the bread I let the cream cheese warm up on the counter for a bit and mixed it with the sour cream and spread it in a shallow baking dish. I spread the salsa over the top and the cheese over that. I baked it for 30 minutes at 350. My husband loved it! I should say so.....he ate the whole thing by himself! I think next time I might add some homemade taco seasoning or chili seasoning in with the cream cheese/sour cream for extra flavor.",
