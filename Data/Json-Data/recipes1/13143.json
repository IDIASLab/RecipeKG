I couldn't use his mother's recipe b/c her measurements were not exact.  It was a little bit of this and a little bit of that.  I thought this was a good recipe, but I would add more sugar to the batter.  My husband and I both agree that it needed more bananas.  I think that if you like it for a desert, more sugar would be appropriate.  It also depends how much you like bananas.  We like the taste of bananas to be very strong and noticable.  Also, I tried a previous suggestion and piped it out of a bag.  The oil was way too hot and they came out like burned funnel cakes.  After the first attempt, I used less heat and transfered the batter to a bowl and used a 1/3 measuring cup as my spoon.  The looked just like his moms.  With more sugar and more banana, I would make this a five star recipe! (I also only use overripe bananas so avoid having to throw them out.  They also seem to be more sweet.)",

                "reviewBody": "It was fine and the texture was just right, but I used nowhere near 1 quart of oil and the banana flavor was barely detectable as Chevonne said. Based on that and other people's comments of blandness, I upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp. and added an extra banana. Wonderful. Beyond that, just some tips: a) A piping bag isn't really necessary. The trick is to drop the right amount of batter in the oil all at once, otherwise you get these strings and odd shapes. I used on overfilled gravy ladle and let a dollop drop in. b) Eggs and milk should be room temp or you risk having a browned outside but uncooked middle. c) Use a lower temp. All stoves are different, so do a test batch at 325 first, then adjust. I ended up using 275 to avoid browning too fast and cooking everything in the middle. d) Don't overcrowd the pan. Each fritter lowers the oil temp, and it's much easier to manage five or six than 10. e) Don't add sugar to the batter, otherwise they'll brown faster. I also used tongs to flip and remove them from the pan before sprinkling with powdered sugar. Great recipe!",
