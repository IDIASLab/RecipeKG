I call it \"Mock Muffalatta;\" my husband and his family call it \"the things with the stuff.\" It is a huge favorite in our family but we make it slightly different. We use 1/2 cup stuffed green olives instead of the black olives and we add 1/2 cup chili sauce or cocktail sauce to the mixture. We also use colby cheese instead of the processed cheese. They're great to keep in the freezer and when you get surprise guests they're ready in 20 min.",
