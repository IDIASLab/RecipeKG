I also grew up in Utah, and yes, this is a popular way to preserve the mother load of green beans most people grow in their gigantic gardens here.  I am not a huge fan of really spicy food, so I tweaked the amount of chile peppers.  I only used two that I divided between the 8 jars. It gave it a little zing, but it was not over powering. REMEMBER,  THIS IS FOR 8 PINT JARS! It isn't too salty if prepared correctly. Happy Canning! :)",

On half the jars I left out the pepper and they are still delicious. I also used about 1/2 the pickling spice and 1/2 the mustard seed and the flavor was still great. I might leave out all the pickling spice and put in all the mustard next time. Great recipe!",
