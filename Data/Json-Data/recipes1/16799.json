Needless to say, they taste best fried, but are great baked as well. I dunked the warm doughnuts into the glaze, placed them onto a wire rack, then sprinkled a cinnamon-sugar mix on top. Also, I don't buy the packages of yeast; 1 package of yeast is equal to 2 1/4 teaspoons from a jar of quick rise yeast. Yum! Will definitely make these again!",

I dipped the doughnuts in the apple cider mix before setting them onto a wire rack. My son absolutely inhaled his and half of mine! Excellent Excellent. THANKS! Will be making these again!",
