I took it a little further though by jazzing it up a little (aka... made it totally unhealthy/fattening but really tasty - eat in moderation!) by giving it a pinch or two of garlic powder draining the juices and adding them to cream of chicken soup a little milk ground black pepper adding it back to the penne in a casserole dish put a mild white grated cheese on top with a little bit of grated sharp cheddar to give it color... baked it until melted and bubbly. Yum. That made it a FIVE star.",
