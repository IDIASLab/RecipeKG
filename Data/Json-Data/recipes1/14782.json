My balsamic basil fig sauce creation drizzled over the sliced lamb is the perfect finish touch and extremely flavorful thanks to the fresh basil.",

It was good--but not nearly as delicious as I was expecting.  First, I would suggest you double or triple the herb/spice rub.  Because it was NOT CLOSE TO ENOUGH.  I really think that if I had done this, it might have been a five star.  Double the liqueur amount.  I subbed black cherry liqueur because I didn't want to buy a bottle of cassis I would never drink.  Lastly, the cooking time is off for this recipe.  Lamb just shouldnt be cooked more than medium rare, which means removal from the oven at 125-130 F on the thermometer.  Check your old cookbooks ladies and gentlemen-- the ones printed before our nation became fearful -- medium rare is 130-135F, and meat always rises 5F internally after removal from the oven!  That means 8-9 minutes per pound for lamb.  My 5 lb roast was done in 40 min--so check it early!! Also, because it's butterflied, the ends of the lamb cook to well while the middle is medium rare, so you can even please the philistines who prfer well-done meat with this recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "This was a very interesting and elegant dish! The herbs really worked well together, but next time I'll use more rosemary. It wasn't quite as flavorful as I had hoped, though. Here are some tips I'll use for next time:  Be very careful in the roasting time/temp. I roasted at 400 for the first thirty minutes and then turned it down to 335 for another 1 1/2 hours. My 5 1/2 pound leg was well-done and should have come out thirty minutes sooner. It was not dry, though.  If you use dry figs in the sauce as I did, add some water to the vinegar or else it becomes too strong.   Don't worry about the basil in the sauce, it works really well and doesn't overwhelm the dish with contrasting flavors. I even suggest using a little more.  If you don't want to purchase creme de cassis, another option is to use red current jelly. I used both and added some of the jelly to the fig sauce as well.   As other reviewers mentioned, I also used  cranberries (dried) in my filling.   I think as an alternative to the prunes, dates might taste nice in this. Next time, I may use both!  Pistachios would be good in the filling in place of the almonds.   This is a fun recipe to get creative with!  ",

I used sliced pork sirloin roast and cherries instead of currants.  I doubled the plum filling recipe so that I could have enough to put inbetween every slice. I had no string so I put the stuffed roast inside of a meatloaf pan and covered with foil. It was so good with the pork we can't even imagine how great it would be with lamb. I ordered a lamb online and can't wait to make it again. Hands down we agreed it was the best dish we've had in months.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is a winner! Made it for Easter and my lamb-hating husband and I both loved it! The key is the wonderful balsamic-fig sauce which would also be good on duck. Do yourself a favor and buy a rolled boneless leg of lamb in netting. When you unroll it cut out the major pockets of fat for a more pleasant dining experience. When you roll it back up with the stuffing get an extra pair of hands to help you put it back into the netting. This works better than tying string and is much easier. This recipe is very forgiving as long as you are true to a few key things: a nice piece of lamb a good quality balsamic fresh basil (or even homegrown dried) figs (or perhaps fresh or dried cherries).

I also had a 5 pound leg of lamb. It took about 1 hour and 25 minutes to cook. Some advice - double the sauce! Everyone loved it!",
