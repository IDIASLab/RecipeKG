But then I added the dairy - I used nonfat half and half - and suddenly this delicious soup became diluted, more fattening and less enticing.  It was good.  But prior it was exquisite.  So next time, I'm adding the half and half a quarter cup at a time.  Also, bacon bits and chives on top and with less cream a dollup of sour cream.  Just like in baked potatoes! And who knows, may even serve warm instead of chilled.  I'm out of control!",

Keep this recipe exactly how it's written! Otherwise, it's just foreplay without sex! (Nice, but never as fulfilling!) Whilst I appreciate the idea of adding a scintilla of curry on top, I personally found it destructive to this wonderful dish. Definitely use fresh chives though, along with proper full fat cream and delicious rich chicken stock. I did add the lightest dusting of fresh cracked black pepper. Chilled to perfection, it was a symphony of flavour!  Lovely. Absolutely Lovely!",
