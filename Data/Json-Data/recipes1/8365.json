                "reviewBody": "Fabulous!  I had some sour cream and very ripe bananas to use up, so I tried this recipe.  So glad I did!  Both the banana and chocolate flavors came through.  Modifications:  1) Used regular sour cream and mini chocolate chips because that's what I had on hand.  With mini chocolate chips, chocolate flavor is more evenly distributed.  Since my bananas were small, I used 7.  2) Whisked dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, and cocoa powder) together in one bowl and created a hole in the middle.  In another bowl, mixed the wet ingredients (margarine, white sugar, eggs, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract).  Then poured the wet mixture and sour cream in the middle of the dry ingredients and mixed by hand until just incorporated.  Finally, stirred in the chips.  This method will prevent tough bread.  3) Instead of two big loaves, I made 8 mini loaves with the batter and baked them for 35 minutes.  Less time and easier to share with friends.  This tastes more like a loaf cake than traditional banana bread, so this will not replace my tried and true banana nut bread recipe.  However, this will be a wonderful addition to my repertoire, especially when I want to impress guests with an unique homemade baked treat.  *Update on 9/22/06: Made bread with regular semi-sweet chocolate chips and mini chips many time with great success.  Today used white chips, and they dissolved into gooey, sticky mess that stuck to the bottom of the pans and left ugly holes throughout the loaves.",

First of all, if you love chocolate, you need to try this.  Second, if you want a spin on traditional banana bread, this is it!  I personally did not find the chocolate overwhelming (you can definitely tell it's banana bread), in fact, I threw in extra chocolate chips!  I also added some walnuts for texture.  The recipe is simple, and quick to throw together...I did extend the baking time a little though.  Try it...you won't regret it!  :)",

However, if you use brown sugar, you may want to add a half teaspoon more of the baking soda in order to balance out the extra acid in the brown sugar (brown sugar has molasses added, making it more acidic than white sugar).
