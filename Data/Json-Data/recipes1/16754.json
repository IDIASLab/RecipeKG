The dough came together and rolled nicely.  However, it did not rise.  When I left it to rest 15 minutes, it stayed inert.  When I cooked it, the bottom crisped up, but the rest stayed thin and doughy.  I'm not sure if it was the requirement of cold water that did it... doesn't yeast (even instant yeast) usually need warm water to grow?  Maybe I'll try this again with warm water.",

With some minor modifications this can be one of your favorite pizza dough recipes as well. I didn't have instant rise yeast so I used a package of rapid rise yeast instead, since I did this alternation I used warm water instead of the cold. I added a teaspoon of garlic powder to the dry ingredients and after kneading the dough I covered and let rise for about 2-3 hours until the dough doubled. I then divided into 4 balls and refrigerated remaining dough I wasn't going to use.  When I have baked this at a 525 degree oven for 10 min my white pizza came out better than an authentic brick oven pizzeria (thats what my husband said). Overall just amazing! I never tried parmesan pizza dough before and now it will probably be my all time fav!! A must for a white pizza recipe!!! Try!!",

Also, the directions don't tell you to pre-bake the crust before you add the toppings.  I pre-baked the crust for 5 minutes at 400*F, topped the pizza and then baked an additional 8-10 minutes.  I didn't taste the parmesan cheese, so that could be eliminated if you don't have any or need to make it milk free.  It's a good recipe for when you want pizza but don't have the hours to spend waiting for your dough to rise.  I will definitely make this again.",

I also came to the conclusion that other types of cheese (emental cheddar etc.) are equally good. I found this out when I ran out of parmesan and I was too lazy to go buy just the parmesan when I had other great cheeses at home.",

Split the dough in half, rolled both out to about 1/4\" thick. I put one on a lightly greased pizza pan and let it proof for about 45 minutes, then baked it at 350' for about 10 minutes, took out and cooled. We added our cheese and toppings and then cooked at 350' for about 10 minutes and at 450' for an additional 4 minutes. I sprinkled about 1 cup of shredded mozzarella on 3/4 of the other dough round, then rolled it up tightly (starting at the end with cheese on) into a log, then I cut the log in 2\" pieces  and set them out on a pan with lightly greased parchment (I wasn't taking any chances on these sticking), so they looked like cinnamon buns or pinwheels. I let those proof for about 45 minutes  and then baked at 350' for about 18 minutes. Whole family loved this pizza dough!",
