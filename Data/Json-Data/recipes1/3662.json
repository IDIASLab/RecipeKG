I had cinnamon applesauce, so we used that, and I substituted pumpkin pie spice for plain ground cinnamon, which was very tasty.  I must agree that this recipe makes more than six slices of french toast - I think I made 10 slices before running out of liquid, so plan accordingly.  Also, be aware that the high sugar content of the batter makes it susceptible to burning, so keep a very close eye on the cooking toast; I found that medium heat worked best for me.  Enjoy!",

I also used Splenda & whole wheat bread. Overall a great recipe & thank you!",

I used cinnamon applesauce because I had no cinnamon and used 1/2 a cup of milk. I had no mixture left. They were a LITTLE \"soggy\" but not enough to make a difference. This recipe is a great way to get your kids to eat whole wheat bread too. I also sprinkled some allspice on top. I would recommend this recipe.",
