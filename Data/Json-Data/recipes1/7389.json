I only had 1.3 pounds of meat but that seemed fine. I left out the olive oil mushrooms and the bay leaf but I added 1 tsp of thyme 1/2 tsp oregano and 1/2 tsp dried parsley. I used 4 cups of beef broth since I knew a lot of it would cook off in the slowcooker over time. I set it on high for the first 6 hours and turned it down to low for about 30 minutes. At the 4 hour mark I added just over 1/2 cup of the wine and when I set it on low I added 4 tbsp. of flour to thicken it. I'm sure this is very good roasted but as I did it it was good as well.",
