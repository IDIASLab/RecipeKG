The sauce is fantastic and would complement so many things that it makes my head spin.  I had beautiful, fresh heads of baby bok choy, and they were overcooked at two minutes.  When I realized they were overdone, I plunged them into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking, but next time I will check at 30 seconds.  I'll probably steam them the next time instead of cooking in a pot of boiling water eliminating the water draining out of the bok choy.  Didn't add salt or oil to the water, and I used cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I think the  presentation should be the whole bok choy with mushroom sauce on top, but I just sliced mine into large pieces this time around.  If you like Asian food, give this recipe a try because it's a winner.",
