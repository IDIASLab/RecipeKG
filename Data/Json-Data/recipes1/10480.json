I figured I could remedy this easy enough by spooning off all the dry stuff.  They we tried eating it.  The cake mix that had gotten moist was a gooey mess. The overall taste was SOOOOO rich and sweet that it was just awful.  Since then I've read the comments and see that adding more butter would have helped with the dry mix on top.  But what about the gooey part?  Did it need to bake longer?  There wasn't any indication as to how well done it should look before removing it from the oven.  Even if I baked it longer it would still be way to sweet and rich.  This experiment ended up in the trash.",

The syrup from the peaches bubbles through the cake mix therefore mixing with the butter which forms a crust instead of just powder on top. I think if the pie filling had more liquid or juice it would help. I will give it a try next time. Also cinnamon can be sprinkled over the top for extra flavor and I always serve my warm with vanilla ice cream!",
