I was gifted with sourdough starter just a couple of months ago and I've been making this recipe every Saturday morning for the grands and it's definitely a step up from my traditional recipe.  Last weekend we had family from Chicago and my brother in law who prides himself on making a delicious breakfast wanted the recipe.  When I told him sourdough, he wasn't ready to take that step!  He sure enjoyed eating them though!  The basic recipe handles changes well.  I use whole wheat flour and we add blueberries.  Last week I added some Kefir and that went well too.",
