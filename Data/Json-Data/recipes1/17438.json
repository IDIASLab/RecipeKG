I also subbed half the raisins for dried cherries and just used about a 4oz bag of M&M's or one of the 1 packs. Thank You",

I had a big bag of M&Ms so I just measured a heaping 1/4 cup of candy, which was a little more than the 1.69 ounces, but I won't complain about a little extra chocolate!  I doubled the batch and can't stop munching on it!  If you just want to make up a small batch of this, I recommend buying the nuts in bulk (much cheaper in the long run) and then freezing them.  Each time you make up a batch, measure the frozen nuts and then mix in fresh raisins & M&Ms... the nuts will keep fresh for a long time this way!  UPDATE 9/13/12:  Made this recipe again today only switched the measurements for cashews and peanuts - I used 1/2 cup dry-roasted peanuts and 1/4 cup of cashews... a little more economical that way!  And I used fall-colored M&Ms  and put the mix in a jar - now it's not only a great snack, it's a pretty fall decoration on my countertop!",
