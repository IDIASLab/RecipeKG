It can be difficult to find and many cheese purveyors will not be familiar with it. Find a local Greek store and they can get it, normally at a very affordable price. \r\n\r\nNote the recipe says to add the cheese to taste. The recipe is very versatile, add saute'd mushrooms or substitute olive oil for very simple changes. Excellent as a side dish or light meal. Much better than those noodle dishes in a bag available at the supermarket.",

I food shop at a huge Greek supermarket in NY so finding it was no problem at all, You have to make sure the butter is a rich caramel color before you add it to the pasta. It makes a difference. Myzithra is very salty but it balances out very well with the sweetness of the butter. I would give it 10 stars if I could! Great recipe!!! ",
