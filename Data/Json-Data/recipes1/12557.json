I did tweak it using oats instead of cornmeal and flax seeds instead of sesame seeds and I used all water rather than part milk (more in line with German recipes). Based on a previous review I doubled the salt but that made it a bit too salty for my taste. Next time I would stick with 1 - 1 1/2 tsp. salt. It is still a very good old world-like bread.",
