I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of wheat germ and 1/2 cup of ground flax seed.  I also added a tablespoon of cinnamon (we love cinnamon) and doubled the vanilla.  And, like the others suggested, I did double the milk to 1/2 cup. The first time I did not put the batter in the refrigerator but it still turned out fine.  We also prefer them rolled out thin.  They are not so much like the store bought ones that way.  They really taste better!    I also substituted a stick of butter for the shortening (healthier).  And, I sprinkled it with cinnamon/sugar and rolled it into the dough before I cut them.  My kids are young and like them smaller.  Just make sure you cut them before you bake them!  Thanks for such a great, simple recipe.  No more Nabisco for us!",

These fit the bill - I substituted 1/2 c flax seed (next time I'll grind it) and 1/2 c of oat bran for 1 c of the whole wheat flour and upped the milk to 1/2 c based on others' suggestions.  I used my silicone (Silpat) baking mats and rolled the dough right on it as thin as I could.  I cut the dough into little rectangles w/ a pizza cutter and sprinkled cinnamon sugar (1 T sugar + 1/2 t cinnamon) over them.  After they had cooled I broke the crackers apart along the lines I made w/ the pizza cutter, which worked great.  The crackers that came out soft I put back in the oven (after I had turned it off) and left them overnight.  This morning they were all wonderfully crispy!  Next time I think I will cut back a little on the brown sugar, especially if I use the cinnamon/sugar topping again.  I'm so glad I found these!!",

I made some plain as the recipe directs and I also sprinkled some with a mixture of 1 tsp. cinnamon to 1 Tbsp. granulated sugar before baking. I liked the cinnamon variety better although the plain was good too and went just as fast. I was surprised at how great a yield I got from one recipe. I tried a short cut and rolled them out directly on the cookie sheet and then used a pizza cutter to cut them into crackers. I then broke them apart after they were done baking and had cooled a bit. The edges are a little crumbly that way but it goes much faster. Using parchment paper would have been a great idea too which I will do next time!",
