I only use Louisiana crawfish (after trying to save and getting a bad package of frozen Chinese crawfish tails). BLEGH! I haven't tried this recipe but it looks great so I am giving it a 4 just so I can warn people not to use Chinese crawfish unless that is your only choice. I am looking for a specific recipe and I am not sure if this is it. I am from Louisiana and really honestly swear that there is a difference in quality. If I were to make these I add a sprinkle of Tony's. (That goes into everything!) Tony Chachere's is as important as the Trinity in my book. (I mean the cooking Trinity (onion bell pepper celery) not the Divine one because THAT one IS SUPREME;)",
