I used an 8X8 pan instead of a 9X9 and I barely had enough chocolate to cover the bottom of the pan let alone to split in half. And the cream cheese layer was HUGE entirely too much. Perhaps if the taste were more balanced but you really need more chocolate to be able to call this a brownie it consists mostly of the cream cheese. It is very sticky and gooey and stuck to the pan despite greasing and flouring. I'll never make this again.",

I halfed the cream cheese like recommended by others but next time may make the full amount as I thought that was the best part of the recipe. The only problem was the cooking time. Like others have said before, after the recommended cooking time, the outside was cooked while the middle was gooey. I made  a \"ring\" of foil (like when cooking pie crusts in the oven to prevent the edges from burning) and covered the cooked outside portion (exposing the uncooked portions) and put back in the oven, checking continuously until cooked. Although it was a pain, the results were fantastic. The taste of the chocolate and cream cheese was similar to black-bottomed cupcakes my mom always used to make.",

I even baked this in a 8x12 cake pan and it turned out great after 35 minutes in the oven. Even though it was hard to spread I felt that it was truly a brownie's thickness when done that way. I was very satisfied. The only different thing I did the second time I made these was increase the amount of vodka in the chocolate mixture by about 3 Tablespoons since I felt that it was a little weak in the alcoholic taste. Finally I heavily recommend oiling the pan well. This recipe is definitely a keeper!",
