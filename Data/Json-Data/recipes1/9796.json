I was excited to taste this \"truffle like rich great cake\" and after spending over 15 for the ingredients (I used some good quality chocolate) I must say I was disheartened. The middle took a lot longer to set and the the whole cake hardened on the outside layer and I ended up taking it off and discarding it. It did not taste very rich at all and I did NOT like it with a graham cracker crust. I would suggest using a shortbread crust. It is dense though so grab your glass of milk...you're going to need it! But that's a good thing. I will keep searching for something richer.",
