Believe it or not I made these for my teen to take to school and give out to her best buds. I packed the rest of the cookies that were not made into necklaces into a container so she could share them with her lunch table. A couple of heart shaped turkey sandwiches (using my cookie cutter) and a little \"love note\" made her day. This just proves that even the big kids get a kick out of these special touches. Thanks so much Jessica and Happy Valentines Day!",

I will be making these cookies and frosting again and again. However making the necklaces was very time consuming (adorable but time consuming). I could not find the long string licorice so I ended up having to tie 3 short strands together for each cookie which took a long time. The holes in the cookies also closed up but it was easy to open them using a pointed knife inserted in the back of the cookie and twisting gently. If you have a meyer lemon tree you just have to make these cookies using the peel/zest from the meyer lemon. I still cannot believe how tasty these cookies are and I am not a fan of lemon cookies.",

The small sized heart cookie cutters were perfect for making the pendants. We put 2 different sized/colored cookies on each necklace. We live in a very small town and couldn't get red lace licorice so we threaded them on variegated yarn. it worked just fine. As for the recipe it was wonderful as directed. I love the shortbread cookie. I will be making it often! I did make some hearts and heart outline cookies and left them unfrosted. I put raspberry preserves on the full cookie and layered the open heart cookie on top. Such a light sweet take on this cookie. Great with a cup of tea or coffee. We will be making these again!
