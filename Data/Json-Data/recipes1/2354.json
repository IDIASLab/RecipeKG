I put it all in one square pan but then had to cook for double the stated time so maybe I should have done 2:) I left out all the nuts due to an allergy in the household. For sourdough starter I used some of my Amish Friendship Starter which has more sugar than regular sourdough. Since I used a sweeter starter I did not use the optional honey. Out of the bowl the glaze was nothing special but when I sat down and had a piece of this coffee cake everything went together and it tasted wonderful! UPDATE: Made this again and this time I split it between two pans. Taste was actually better! I still had to cook 5 minutes longer than recipe states. I highly recommend this recipe it melts in your mouth!",

There wasn't any liquid except for the 1 cup starter and 2/3 cup oil. Had to add milk to even stir it. One question why the extra salt when self rising flour already has salt in it. It's in the oven now and I am saying a heil Mary prayer over it so that we can at least eat it. If anyone knows what I did wrong please tell me.",

Much thicker. I added half a cup of milk. I suspect that the sourdough starter that I already had is much thicker than the sourdough starter that is decribed in this recipe. I am letting the starter do it's magic overnight and then will cook in the morning. We will see....",
