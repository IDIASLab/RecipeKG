Then I added the other half of the pie filling to the condensed milk and lemon juice mixture. Next split that mixture in half. The first half is for the cake filling and the second half will be for the icing. Add 2 tblsp corn starch & 2 tblsp powdered sugar. Mix with electric beater and let firm in frig. When set spread between cake layers (I only made two layers). It comes out like a lemon mousse filling!!! Now put that in the fridge to set some more. Mix the second half of the milk/juice mixture with about 6 ounces of the whipped cream. This should set for a minute too. Then spoon on top of cake and lightly smooth all over cake. It will have a beautiful shiny glaze.",

To the cake mix I add one cup of sour cream; 5.9 onz of lemon instant pudding mix, 1 cup of veg oil, 4 eggs and 1/2 cup of sprite or 7-up. For the rest, I've followed the icing directions and how it's prepared. It keeps well and tastes better the longer it stays in the fridge, however it doesn't last that long around our house. ",

As the cake came out of the oven I poked wholes in the cake and then smoothed 1/2 the filling over the cake. After the cake had cooled I put the filling with the whipped topping folded in on top. I sprinkled the topping with a little yellow crystal-sugar. Everyone loved it. The smaller sizes of cake were perfect for a potluck dinner.",
