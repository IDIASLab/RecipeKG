Even though it came out delicious and everyone including the little grandchildren loved it and asked for more and more, it did not really come out like the one in Chef John's video.\n\nThe instructions were easy to follow.  There was just one thing I did differently.  I could not bring myself to use 1/4 cup of pepper for the rub and therefore I adjusted the measurements of the other rub ingredients accordingly.\n\nThe pastrami roast came out delicious and so tender.  It was brown like a brisket, not red like a pastrami!  That was not a problem for my family, but it made it a little difficult to review since it is supposed to be pastrami!",

At first, I was a little intimidated by this recipe. Not because of the recipe or the ingredients because I had everything on hand and the recipe was super simple to follow, as is all of Chef John's brilliant recipes. But just the thought of making pastrami on my own scared the *bleep* out of me! I don't know why I ever doubted my skills or Chef John's instruction because the end result was nothing short of perfection! Thank you Chef John for sharing yet another amazing recipe!",

And that's just what \"Chef John\" said that it was a substitute not exactly. I find that to be true. The spice blend is good yet a tad overly peppery. With that said the meat (inside) lacked some flavor that Pastrami usually has. I'm sure that would have to do with brining. So my conclusion would be... I will probably brine a brisket for a few days and then use this spice blend minus a bit of the pepper (not much though.) I might try smoking the meat as well. I know hard work was put into this. Thank-You",
