I DID read all the reviews and take that into consideration...some of the things I may have altered were...I used 1 med. size onion, not 1/2 cup, I added  zucchini to the skillet after cooking corn/onion/jalape\u00f1o, I think that, in addition to the thin slices, made them so much more yummy.  I also added a couple TBSP butter to the skillet, people said the dish lacked flavor, I didn't wanna risk it ;) I also added salt, pepper, dash of cayenne pepper, garlic powder & some celery seeds.  These made for a VERY flavorful and yummy dish! I don't measure stuff...sorry :( but keep in mind, when seasoning a dish make sure to add enough to season ALL of the dish, not just the veggies on top! stir it all in really well and you'll have a delicious side dish that you WILL want to make again.  I didn't use the \"Touch of Philly\" cheese as I couldn't find it, turned out fine. Enjoy!",
