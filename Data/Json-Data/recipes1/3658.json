I have made it at least 10 times for my family and friends, and they always turn out tasting good. I always use the \"microwave and glass bowl technique\" to melt the chocolate chips and baking chocolate. The only problem I have had when baking these cookies is that sometimes they flatten out too much if the batter gets too close to room temperature. They seem to do much better when the batter is put in the refrigerator for 15 minutes before baking. Watch these closely--as soon as they begin cracking, take them out--they will look gooey, but after they cool, they will be rich and delicious! Thanks for this recipe--one of my favorites!",
