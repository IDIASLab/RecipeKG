For the batter I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Also, I added in 3/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla.  I baked it at 325 for 22 minutes and it turned out perfect!  It was so moist and flavorful and it was gone within 12 hours!  Easy and I love how it uses things just sitting around in the pantry.",

That's a pretty good compliment considering I bake something just about every day. The only changes I made were substituting shortening for butter (only because I didn't have butter....next time I will use butter) I tripled the topping and put half batter in the pan, layered in half the topping, then poured the rest of the batter in and topped with remaining topping. Excellent!",

It's definitely better than some of the others I've made off this site. I added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter. Though there isn't much that makes this taste like a snickerdoodle I think this is perfect for breakfast or a tea. The batter would also be a great base for banana cake or apple cake.
