This recipe is an excellent base to add in any vegetables you prefer. A Mexican cheese blend would work too for a Mexican flare instead of Italian. I did not have the three cheese blend so made up my own three cheese blend of (equal amounts of); mozzarella parmigiana & cheddar. Aside from the vegetables listed I also added in diced onions & bell peppers. Then I seasoned the egg mixture with salt pepper and garlic powder. Definitely will made this again.",
