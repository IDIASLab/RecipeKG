First of all when browning the chicken DO NOT cook on high unless you want your house to turn into a hot box with all the smoke. Instead cook on low for about 10 mins per side. I did as the chef instructed and it smoked like crazy. The other thing is this dish is way too spicy for me. The peppers ruin the dish.",
