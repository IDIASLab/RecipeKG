I also just used half a can of diced tomatoes rather than cutting up roma tomatoes. The presentation was virtually identical to the picture but I laid down a bed of fluffy instant rice then a layer of mango salsa then th e tilapia then a topping of mango salsa with avocados and steamed broccoli rounding up the corners. A mango margarita makes a perfect accompaniment. It was fantastic!",

I only gave it 4 stars because I think the fish is better if it marinades for at least an hour and I also like to give it an additional spritz of fresh orange right before serving.  The salsa is wonderful and would be good on anything.  I purchased frozen mango chunks when I made this recipe the second time, it saved me a lot of time.  When I have leftover salsa I like to add a can of drained and rinsed black beans and take that as my lunch.  Overall excellent recipe, I will definitely make this one again and again!",

Otherwise this recipe is darn near perfect. My adjustments: We prefer cod to tilapia. I did NOT peel the tomatoes and I added an extra pinch of salt to the salsa. Served with toasted couscous and a green salad this was beyond delicious. And it's a beautiful dish. We'll definitely have this again. In fact this salsa recipe has just become my party salsa.",

I do use only about 1/3 cup red onion in the salsa and as much cilantro as I feel like chopping - usually less than called for. And I have tried all kinds of tomatoes and even simple dried ground ginger. As expected the flavor varies with the ingredients but it's always delicious.",
