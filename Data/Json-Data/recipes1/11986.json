The crunchy tortilla chips on top made a good contrast to the beef and bean mixture--I think I'll add an extra 1/2 c. next time.

The mustard/ketchup flavor works so well with the beans and the crunchy topping is a wonderful contrast. My only changes were to add a little garlic powder a splash of hot sauce and I used extra-sharp Cheddar cheese. Thanks so much Angela!
