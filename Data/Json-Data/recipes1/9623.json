                "reviewBody": "There were several things that appealed to me about this cake not the least of which was that it called for 3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa which told me this would be good and chocolaty. I also liked the butter and shortening combo knowing I d get the best of both - the incomparable flavor of the butter and the added moistness from the shortening. I did notice there was no salt in the recipe so I added half a teaspoon but it was not enough to help the surprising lack of flavor I found with this cake in spite of the generous amount of cocoa. The bottom line is that this was a mildly chocolate cake rather light in color and not nearly as moist as I would have liked. It s an ok cake but not something I d consider making again. Perhaps it s buttermilk oil and/or coffee that are the deciding factors that make a chocolate cake moist and boldly chocolate. I did not use the frozen whipped topping or the bananas choosing instead to use my own chocolate buttercream frosting.",
