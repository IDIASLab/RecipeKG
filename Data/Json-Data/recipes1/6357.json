Ate as a sandwich on whole-grain bread, with sliced avocados and baby lettuces.  So good!  Next time I might add a dash of lemon juice and some garlic powder.",

I used regular Mayo and unflavored Greek style yogurt. I don't care for capers, per another reviewer suggestion I used 3/4 tsp. of dill.  The dill complimented the tang of the yogurt nicely.  Curry powder would be a nice seasoning for this dish, I would start with 1/2 tsp. then adjust up if needed. \r\n\r\nI served this on artisan bread with red leaf lettuce and sliced tomato.  Cantaloupe was served as well.  A nice Zinfandel, fresh limeade would be a great beverage choice with this one.",

Question: I bought a can of wild caught pink salmon (my first time buying canned salmon) and was disappointed to find plenty of bones and some skin residues along with the salmon. I suspect this isn't in all canned salmon versions. Can anyone recommend a brand that comes without the bones? Thanks in advance.",
