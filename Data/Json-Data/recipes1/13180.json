A tip I learned is to chop up the tomatoes and let them sit in a colander or big pot overnight or at least a few hours. The juice will seperate from the toms. The juice will then seperte like fat from stock. The top will be a bright red tomato sauce, the bottom is tomato water. Use the top sauce to cook the toms and discard the water or use it to cook rice, add to soup, make bread. It will last in the firidge for several days. The toms will cook down and thicken in half the time and less chance of scorching the pot",

UPDATE: I canned this recipe (the whole recipe, not half) in 500mL (16oz) jars and yielded 6 cans. I filled the jars with the tomatoes and veggies first, then topped it up with the liquid until the volume was level with the bottom thread of the jar. I processed them in a boiling water bath for 1 hour. When I opened my first can about 6 weeks later it was EVEN BETTER than when I made it fresh. The flavour was incredible! So I'm changing my review from 4 stars to 5 stars and I highly reccommend that you can this recipe!  ",

Then I sauteed the onion pepper & garlic in a tsp. of olive oil before adding the tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe Leah!",
