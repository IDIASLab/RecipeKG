I will always use the Saltines from now on. Oh and I definitely don't use a whole chopped onion. I grate about 1 or 2 tablespoons of onion because I don't like crunchy raw onion chunks in this kind of dish. Another addition I sometimes make is adding a can or two of chopped green chilis.",

I do make a few changes though: I use 2 pounds of hash browns instead of 1 (too liquidy with only 1) I cut out the onion and I use corn flakes for the topping. I have tried both letting it sit overnight and just assembling and baking right away and I actually think it tastes better if I bake it right after assembling if I stir it all together first. I should also note that with the extra potatoes it does take longer to cook. I increase the temperature to 400 degrees and let it cook for an hour. But really it is hard to mess this one up. It comes out great every time!",
