On second batch I only added one cup of sugar because that was all I had left and it still tasted great.  Will only add one cup next time just to cut back on the sugar content.  Received lots of positive comments on the punch and my husband asked me to make more the next day with the leftover ingredients.  Thanks!!",

Be sure to add the almond extract.  It melds the other flavours together. This is a keeper.",
