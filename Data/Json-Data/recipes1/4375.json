The cream cheese perfectly complemented the pumpkin flavor 3) I used pumpkin pie mix instead of straight pumpkin puree. The Sauce: Instead of the recommended sauce I used the remaining pumpkin pie mix to make a pumpkin sage cream sauce. It was absolutely delicious. Just mix in a shallow pan or skillet a 1/2 a cup of pumpkin pie mix with a cup of heavy cream. Add 1/4 cup of romano cheese. Chopped some sage leaves and put it into the mix. Add pepper and salt and stir the mixture. Let the sauce simmer for a few minutes until the sauce thickens.",

I made the following substitutions: used a combination of homemade kefir-based ricotta-type cheese and store-bought Neufchatel to replace all the ricotta in the recipe and used tomato sauce instead of tomato paste (it's what I had). I just didn't need to add any water to the pasta dough. I've often made noodles from scratch before but this was my 1st time making ravioli. It was time-consuming but a fun project for my 6 yo to help with. Just make sure you dry the ravioli as directed before boiling...otherwise you'll end up with the filling leaking out into the pasta water (like I did). This is definitely going into my regular recipe rotation!",

What may I ask were you looking for?   Go to your grociers premade pasta shelves if you want to do less work, but be forewarned, 1) you won't easily find pumpkin and 2) you won't find the flavor.If you don't want to do the work to have the experience of creating something from scratch than don't rate it, but if you are not feeling lazy, go for this recipe because it is a winner!",
