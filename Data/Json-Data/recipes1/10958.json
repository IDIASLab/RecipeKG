Might taste a little less like a true tortiere, but it sure makes a delicious meat pie that even picky kids will love.\n\n3) If you think you have celery in your crisper and realize at the last minute that you don't, a cup of frozen peas tossed in makes a great substitute.\n\n4)Tasty recipe and very easy.",

I chopped everything into small pieces and they all came out fully cooked. I've never had French Canadian food before so I wasn't used to the combinations. While it was okay I think that next time I will omit the sweet spices (cinnamon nutmeg & cloves) and substitute savory such as marjoram garlic powder onion powder and maybe basil.

For ease and consistency, I put the potato, celery and carrot through the food processor, chopped very fine.  I did as another reviewer suggested - cooked the meat the day before.  I used Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust for the pastry - this is the best pastry.  And I made the pies into 5\" tart size.  We had one last night and the rest I've frozen.    I was making these for gifts so I 6X the filling recipe and doubled the pastry recipe - got exactly 16 small pies.  A tourtiere is different from a regular meat pie.  Leave the spices out and that's what you've got - a regular meat pie, not tourtiere.  I put the rather dry pastry scraps into the mixer, added a little water (maybe a TBSP), added 1 c. grated cheddar,  mixed well, rolled out into straws and baked.  No waste and delicious.",

The spices were perfect and filled my kitchen with a wonderful savory scent.

This time though I made it using an empanada maker as little mini-pies to have as appetizers. If you do this I'd recommend adding the potato at the same time as the other veg along with a little more water and simmering for about 20 minutes ( you want the potato to be firm tender). This is because the bake time on the little pies is only about 20 minutes instead of the full 45 so the potato won't get done in the oven. This quantity of filling will make about 3 - 4 dozen 3.5 inch diameter empanadas. If you reroll the scraps you can get about a dozen from one 9 in. crust so you'll need four crusts for the entire batch.",
