I prepared the chicken as directed with the addition of fresh cracked pepper and added home made chicken broth to it about a cup and a half. To the vegetables i added mushroom and onion and stir fried them for a few minutes until they were still crispy yet hot. All the while the angel hair was cooking as this dish is quite fast once you get done with the chicken. Added the vegetables to the chicken/broth combo tossed them then simmered for about three minutes. Drained pasta tossed with some olive oil and then dumped the vegetable/chicken mixture on top. Added some fresh vine ripened tomatos chopped into small pieces and grated fresh parmesian cheese on top. Then when people served they grated a bit more cheese (not much actually) salt cracked pepper... and it turned out perfectly. My mom who enjoys my cooking said this was the best thing I have made yet. Made a huge pot a pound of pasta pretty much tripled this recipe and it was all gone by the next morning. One more thing... to increase the flavor use ALOT more basil (fresh) than suggested here. I used nearly a cup and a half. Simmered half of it with the chicken and the other half i sprinkled on right before serving. You dont need heavy cheese or cream sauces if you try it this way.",
