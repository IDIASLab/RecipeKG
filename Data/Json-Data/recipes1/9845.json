I can really appreciate the after much experimentation. been there, done that.  but that is what we good cooks do. lol. try and try til we get it right, and someone will change it, but that is ok, we are happy with what we got.

For a sweeter sausage flavor, I like to add either a tablespoon or so of brown sugar or maple syrup.",
