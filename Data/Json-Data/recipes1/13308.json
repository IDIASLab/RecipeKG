Instead of chili sauce i used a couple of tablespoons of chili powder, and when I am in a pinch i use regular mustard instead of dry.  Depending on whether or not I will be bbq-ing the meat i will include a little of the final bbq sauce with it.  I also like adding a little garlic and onion powder because I just can't seem to cook with out them :)  As I said I just love this marinade.  (it works well as a sauce for Crockpot cooking too!)",
