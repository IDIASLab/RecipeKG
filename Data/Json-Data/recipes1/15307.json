It only took 3 hours to rise and then I had to take it out of the fridge because it was getting too big. I would advise letting it rise on a cookie sheet... there is no way it would have been contained in a bowl. Wonderful flavor. Quick oats worked as well as any. NOTE: The author does not recommend cooking time... this was done for me in 35 minutes. VERY HAPPY WITH THIS.",

Will use half or maybe even all honey from now on (mostly because it's cheaper). I used all whole wheat flour (and added at least a cup more flour than the recipe said) and it still turned out light fluffy and wonderful. My husband will love sandwiches made with this bread--he likes softer bread. For me this recipe made one large loaf and 5 large rolls that I baked together in a second loaf pan. I promptly polished off 2 of the rolls with butter for breakfast. Baked the bread for about 25 minutes.",

I let the bread rise in a giant Tupperware bowl in the fridge for 6 hours and it pushed the lid up so make sure you give it a lot of room to grow.

                "reviewBody": "I am a bread baking fiend and this one really fell a bit short in my book. First of all it really really needs more salt. Or use a finer grain salt like pickling salt. After I made this as it was it had no flavor. Texture yes. Egg sizes vary and you should try and use powdered eggs and cut the amount to one eggs worth. I would reccomend mixing 2 cups of flour with the warm wetworks and add the yeast. let it sit for about 20 minutes then start adding the rest of the flour. I make a lot of Rye and pumpernickel and so the molasses concept didn't bother me. However to speed the rising I would definitely switch it to dark corn syrup or a honey mix. It make s a slightly lighter consistancy.",
