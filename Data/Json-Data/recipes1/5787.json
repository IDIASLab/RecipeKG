I added 1/2 tsp. sea salt and 1/2 tsp. fresh cracked black pepper to the marinade.  Then I put the fish in a Ziploc bag, poured in the marinade, and shook gently to coat.  The marinade had a good flavor, but wasn't overpowering, which I liked.  Watch the cooking time--be sure that you get the center of the fish to at least 145 degrees.  We had our gas grill preheated to medium heat and it took us about 8 minutes per side.",
