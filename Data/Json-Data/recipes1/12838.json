I added more mushrooms garlic and tomatoes. I also put a bit of sugar to cut the acidity of both lemon and tomatoes. I originally cut all the veggies up and put it one bowl with the garlic lemon juice sugar and tomatoes then added that to the pan after I cooked the chicken and set it aside. Just because of timing I ended up simmering the whole thing for a few minutes. The end result..you have a thin sauce that goes great with pasta and you can taste a hint of lemon.",

I can definitely see using zucchini squash green beans eggplant etc. or whatever else is on hand as part of the mix. And you could certainly try a little balsamic vinegar to sweeten up the sauce (drop the lemon) or even using white wine. This recipe is a great base with endless possibilites. I will certainly enjoy trying them all!",
