First...I don't use wine vinegar but white vinegar works just fine. Also instead of just green pepper I use 1/2 each red yellow and green. Makes it very colorful. Also try adding sliced mushrooms sliced water chestnuts or bamboo shoots...and definately double the sauce! I serve this over Egg Fried Rice which you can also find the recipe for here and it is a meal people won't soon forget. Just a great recipe.",

However I did make a few changes: I used fresh chopped garlic and ginger instead of garlic salt and ground ginger. This made it taste even more oriental and with a much more refreshing taste. And instead of using gravy mix I just added two tsp corn starch (dilluted in water) and added this while the liquid is simmering in the wok/pan. This recipe is now a staple in my kitchen and will keep on making it for years to come!",
