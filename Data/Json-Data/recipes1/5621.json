Browning the chicken pieces in the oil used for the roux adds flavor to the dish.  I use the cooked chicken for chicken salad.  File is added off the heat to thicken the gumbo. If added while the gumbo is still cooking, it may become stringy and unpleasant.  File is ground sassafras leaves.  It is available in many supermarkets.",

My friend from Louisianna helped me make this, and told me instead of constantly stirring the roux, to let it sit for a minute or two, then stir, let sit, etc.  I don't think my roux would have EVER turned brown if she hadn't told me this!  I put more green pepper in than this called for, a can of tomatoes, used 1/2 olive oil and half veg oil, other than that, stuck to the recipe for an excellent product.  One other note:  My friend told me her mom makes a lot of roux at a time, and freezes it in baggies so that next time, she doesn't have to stand at the stove for so long.  Thanks Merwin!",

I think this is the best recipe I've found.  I did speed it up by doing a few of the steps simultaneously in two pots, so my total cooking time was about 2 hours.  \n\n1. First I browned the chicken in light olive oil (holds up to heat better than regular) in a heavy skillet.  I put the chicken aside to be added back and cooked in the gumbo during the last 40 minutes. (Chicken included is how I know gumbo.)\n\n2. Then I cooked the roux in the heavy skillet simultaneously with browning the sausage (I used Polish, sliced in circles) in a large soup pot.  For the roux, I added to the oil that had browned the chicken more olive oil and 1/4 cup of butter to make a total of about a cup of oil/butter, and gradually added about a cup and a half of flour, stirring constantly so that the roux was smooth.  I like to use a metal spatula (aka turner) so that I can quickly scrape the bottom of the skillet and not let the roux burn.\n\n3. While the sausage browned in one pot, and the roux browned in the other (stirring every couple of minutes), I finely chopped the Cajon \"trinity\" of onion, bell pepper, and celery. I added the vegies to the sausage pot, along with cajon seasoning (salt, pepper, etc.), garlic, and a little olive oil.   \n\n4. When the vegies were wilted and the roux was \"darker than peanut butter,\" I added the roux to the sausage and vegies, along",

I browned four chicken thighs skin and all I did not save the meat rather after I was finished cooking with it I skinned and de-boned the thighs and set the meat aside with the shrimp. I also sauteed the smoked sausage then set it aside with the shrimp & chicken (this keeps the flavor from being boiled out of the sausage). I added all of the meat together at the end for the final few minutes. As far as this recipe being bland all good cooks know that you have to taste as you cook and add more seasoning to meet your family's taste (expecially salt & pepper). I love things a little warmer but I know that my family will only tolerate 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne in a dish like this so that is what I use. If you want this dish spicier... add more! This is a great gumbo recipe! Thanks for sharing!",

Thank you Merwin for stepping in and giving us a great no-fail recipe! The best part is where you make the roux and the recipe actually says that it takes time lots of time to stir and stir and allow the roux to darken and develop that characteristic richness. Absolutely wonderful! I used jalapeno spicy Texas sausage that I bought at Costco plus some shrimp my dad gets from Louisiana. Before serving i skimmed the oil/fat from the liquid by using one of those gravy cups. The recipe is excellent when you use quality ingredients. Most of all I appreciate the technique in preparing the all-important roux. Thank you again for a great recipe!",
