I do prefer them with shrimp though, and the only real thing bringing flavor to these was the peanut sauce and cucumber.  They would have benefited from basil leaves, mint and cilantro for a more traditional taste. Next time I would also saute the tofu in sesame oil for added flavor. A little difficult to eat because of the dry broccoli slaw, but very healthy.",
