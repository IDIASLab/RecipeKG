I sauteed up 1/2 cup onions 4 cloves of garlic...added the red pepper and broccoli. Then I put in regular cream cheese (store didn't have cooking creme) and added about 1/2 cup organic free range chicken broth. Added salt and pepper to taste as well as onion powder garlic salt and Italian seasoning. I used Capellini noodles as I couldn't find vermicelli. I also cooked my chicken strips separate in the oven. So all in all it turned out pretty good. Family was happy.",
