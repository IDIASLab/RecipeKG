I only tried a rutabaga once before and wasn't a huge fan, but in this recipe you'd never know it wasn't a potato.   Parboiling in advance makes this recipe super simple. Its easy to divide too, I made this for just my husband and I, so we didn't need 15 lbs of veggies. I used just 8 oz of each vegetable and estimated the rest of the ingredients. It turned out perfect.   I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing!",
