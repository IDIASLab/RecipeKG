I think it's the \"basicness\" of this recipe that is most appealing. Not much to mess up and the results are wonderful.\nI left the ingredients exactly as stated and didn't change anything. I was left with a sensationally robust chunky and very flavoursome soup. \nThe only thing i MAY try next time is instead of cutting up all the bacon i'll just grab bacon bits. But it may detract from the presentation of the soup at the end. It's nice to see all those chunks of potato and bacon in it. My family AND neighbours loved it and i'll definately be making it again.",

I modified the recipe somewhat by mixing in one-third of the sauteed leeks with the cooked potatoes, then blending about two-thirds of the resulting soup into a puree before mixing it back in with the rest of the potatoes and adding the remaining leeks and cream.  It's a very rich soup and Half and Half cream seems to sustain the flavor while reducing the calories and fat content somewhat.",

                "reviewBody": "Wow! I was at the store and noticed the fresh leeks and bought them on a whim, then came home and looked up a recipe - i'm so glad I picked this one! I am literally eating the soup as we speak and it is phenomenal. After reading other's reviews and seeing what I had on hand, I used 5 cups of chicken broth instead of 4 (5 cups of water seasoned with chicken buillion cubes); used half a pound of bacon and half a pound of cubed pancetta (I live in Italy now and we have to use what we can find!); sauteed 4 chopped garlic cloves with the 2 whole leeks; after the potatoes were tender I took out approximately 1/4 of the batch and mashed them easily by hand with a masher. This recipe is delicious. A good way to clean leeks for those of us who dont cook with them often is as follows:\n1. Rinse the outsides, cut off the bulb/root.\n2. remove any outside leaves that are spotty or extra dark green, trim the ends of the green top of the leek.\n3. cut the leek lengthwise down the middle, and chop according to recipe.\n4. Place leeks in bowl of warm water and swirl around to remove excess dirt.\n5. scoop out leeks and place in colandar, rinse. \nIt seems like alot of work, but really its not that hard and it is worth it to not have dirt in your recipe. \n\nThanks for the delicious soup - will most definitely make again!",

I always use milk to make it more healthy.  To make up for it, and to make the soup thicker, I stir in about 1/4 cup of potato flour - this makes it perfect - almost like a thick stew.
