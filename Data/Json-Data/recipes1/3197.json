I used my Kitchen Aid to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast in the mixer bowl with the sugar and warm water for ten minutes until the yeast \"bloomed\", then I added melted margerine, the egg, the remaining water and the dry ingredients. I did not use self-rising flour, just regular AP flour. This dough needed more flour than the recipe stated to get the dough into a ball and able to jump on a hook, over a cup. I kneaded this dough with my dough hook for about five minutes, then I set it to rise for an hour in a large greased bowl covered with a tea towel on a warm heating pad for an hour. I used a 1/3 cup measuring cup to make uniform rolls and rolled them on the counter to make better shaped rolls. I covered the top of the rolls in the muffin tin with saran wrap before letting it rise on the warm heating pad for another hour or so. I baked them at 400 degrees for 12 minutes, then brushed the tops of the hot rolls with vegetable oil right out of the oven. These rolls were GINORMOUS. They looked pretty and turned out fluffy and the perfect roll consistancy but they were quite sweet. Not so much a dinner roll for us, but I think this would make a good base for a sweet roll.",

These come out perfect with my Kitchenaid mixer every time. It's also even better using bread flour which makes them lighter and softer. I don't refrigerate over night instead I let rise for 45 minutes and then dump on floured surface and make into rolls using as little dusting flour as possible. Cover with plastic and let rise again for 30-45 minutes before baking. Be sure to put the rolls about 1 inch apart being closer together makes for a taller and softer roll. Excellent recipe thank you!",

I live in a high altitude area so I added a bit more water and butter increased the cooking temp a bit and a little less sugar (all based upon the high altitude teaching lesson on this website)...Perfect...I also did not refrigerate but followed another users review and used my electric mixer (so easy) and after forming into balls very close together I plastic wrapped the dough balls and let them rise again. Baked until I saw a medium brown color. Sprayed tops of rolls and rolls on the side of pan with spray butter. So So yummy....",
