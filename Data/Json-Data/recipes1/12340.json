I made it for a get together where several of my friends recall their mothers making it for them at home and said it tasted just as good. But I found it incredibly easy to make and absolutely delicious. I used cardamom and rose water for extra flavor and even used cinnamon with the cardamom on one batch. I blended them all together instead of sprinkling the cardamom and cinnamon on top aftwewards. Because I was having a Post-Valentine's dessert party I added a few drops of red food coloring to one batch. I highly recommend this recipie to anyone who loves ice cream yet desires something different and more healthy! TO cut down on fat and not sacrifice taste you can also use fat free sweetened condensed milk and low fat evaporated milk with fat free or low fat Cool Whip. It tastes just as good.",

Then I blended 3/4 cups regular milk with the bread. I strained the scaled milks into the bread mixture to remove the cardamom seeds, and it in the fridge to cool off.

I made 10 kulfis not 24 but the servings were about the right size I think. I poured equal quantities in disposable plastic cups to get the \"kulfi\" shape.",

I did as suggested and substituted fat free evaporated milk and Cool Whip Lite. I also blended the bread and Cool Whip first to avoid overflowing the blender too much then added the milks. I also had some trouble sprinkling the cardamom without clumping it but managed it by finger sprinkling it. I sprinkled the cardamom on before freezing it. Swirling the cardamom into the top layer seemed to give it a bit more flavor. A fantastic recipe! Thanks",
