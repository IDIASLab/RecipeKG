The key to making these taste so good is to cook them so the cheese melts but the rolls do not get toasted. These are also good using roast beef and Havarti cheese.",

I used the Honey Mustard Dressing II from AR as another reviewer suggested. That was a five star recipe as well, so I would also suggest using that with this recipe. I didn't know I was out of sesame seeds, so I used dried, minced onion on top instead which I think was probably better anyway. We all really liked these and I will make them again soon for sure!!!",
