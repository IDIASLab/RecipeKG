                "reviewBody": "I have not made this recipe yet, but while reading the reviews I noticed many people having trouble ending up with a soggy crust and overcooked toppings.  To avoid this, you must work with a pizza stone and a pizza peel.  Place the stone in your oven, preheat the oven to 500 degrees.  Allow the pizza stone to heat for 30 minutes at this temperature.  Meanwhile prepare your pizza on your floured pizza peel (be sure to give your pizza crust a little shake on the peel prior to putting on your toppings so that you can add more flour if necessary - doing this will ensure that it will slide off easily onto the stone ).  Once you are sure your pizza will slide off easily, top it however you want and then slide it very carefully onto the stone in the oven.  Heating the stone for 30 minutes prior to baking the pizza will ensure a thoroughly cooked crispy pizza crust.  Watch your pizza very carefully as it will cook fast at this temperature.",

It just depends if you like thinner or thicker crusts.  After I rolled it out and let it rise for 10 or 15 minutes, I prebaked it for about 10 minutes at 350F.  That helps keep the crust from getting soggy and you don't have to bake it so long with the toppings, which can easily burn at 425F.",

I don't know if it was entirely this recipe or the new whole grain flour I used from Healthy Choice, but the taste and texture were very good. So, yes, I used the whole grain all-purpose in lieu of the bread flour (which I never use these days).  I used the dough cycle of my bread machine and when I began to roll out my dough it was an absolute pleasure. It was doughy and yeasty, but no too sticky. I added parmesan cheese and pizza herbs and garlic to the dough which yielded a flavorful, flexible dough that rose slightly (not too thick).  When I have used other pizza doughs, they have been rather hard to manage in comparison and have risen so much during baking that the recipe for pepperoni bread (also found on this site) was too \"bready\" in a lot of spots.  I may still alternate w/ other pizza dough recipes, but at this point, this is by far my favorite, especially for calzones and pepperoni breads.",

This one gets even better after we freeze it and thaw it for later use. I made these thin and crispy. Directions were easy to follow, dough was easy to handle. It made 3 large crusts as stated, I froze two, so I'll update later as to how they worked out. I did not prebake this and it turned out great. An awesome crust recipe, I am pleased in how this turned out and I do highly recommend this. This is even better that Jay's signature crust.\nUPDATE: I thawed one crust out for lunch today and the pizza that resulted was fabulous! The crust came out very light with a crispy crunchy outside and soft inside. This was better than any pizza chain pizza crust ever thought to be! I cooked this for only 16 minutes, it would have burned in 20. This dough is so easy to work with, it is incredible. *****5 stars***** I still have 1 crust left in the freezer, yippee! I am so delighted with this recipe.",

I had no problem with the prep, rising, etc., but when we tasted it, it was more like wheat bread with pizza toppings.  If you're looking for traditional pizza dough, this is not it.  The consistency is like bread, not dough...maybe from the bread flour.  Also, dough takes longer to cook than toppings and is puffy and soggy.  I won't be making this again.",
