To make these a little more healthy, I use 1 cup whole wheat flour + 1 cup all purpose and substitute half of the oil with 1/2 cup applesauce.  Instead of 1 cup white sugar, I use 1/4 cup brown sugar + 1/3 cup splenda granulated (or white sugar).\n\nFor an extra kick of flavor, try adding 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  I dice or mash lightly at least one of the bananas so that there are yummy chunks of banana in some bites and sometimes throw in 2 tbsp of chocolate chips or oatmeal to vary the texture and reduce sugar or flour accordingly.  I add additional chopped walnuts or sliced almonds to the top for decoration.  I tend to fill the muffin cups to the top for puffy muffins and this recipe yields exactly 12 regular (~20 min) or 24 mini (~14 min).",
