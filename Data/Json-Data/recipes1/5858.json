I found my recipe and discovered that the difference was that mine said to melt the butter I wondered how I was supposed to pour over.  I will go back to mine - much better version - also no cake cooks in 30 minutes - I think I was going on 60 when I gave up",

                "reviewBody": "It seems the uglier it looks, the better it tastes! As the recipe states, a toothpick will not come out clean as this cake is intended to be gooey.  You cannot pour the cream cheese batter over the mix; you will have to drop heaping spoonfuls over the mix.  These spoonfuls will sink through the cake as it cooks resulting in a moist cake and gooey coconut bottom.  Sometimes they completely submerge into the cake and other times they sink about halfway.  You normally do have to cook for more than 30 minutes but not always a whole 45 minutes.  The cake is done when either all the cream cheese mix has submerged or it has partially submerged and the remaining mixture has browned.  The cake will still wiggle while warm (making some think the cake is not done) but if you let it cool then the wiggle will stop.  I have heard some refer to this as an upside-down german chocolate cake.  I believe it does better if you don't get a boxed cake mix with pudding in the mix.  If your coconut is a little dried out, you can add a couple of tablespoons of butter more to the mix and the cocomut will soften.  I have made this cake for years and it isn't much to look at but certainly is still a crowd pleaser.",
