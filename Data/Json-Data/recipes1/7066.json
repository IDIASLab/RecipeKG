Just put the brussels sprouts in a baking dish almost cover them with broth (I used about 1/4 less than the recipe called for) bake for 20 minutes on 400. Remove them from the oven take out the brussels sprouts and prepare the mustard sauce in the baking dish (since there is less broth the sauce gets really creamy-yum!!) return the brussels sprouts to the dish and bake for about 10 minutes until the sauce reaches the right consistency. These were the best brussels sprouts I have ever had!!",
