I had alot of apples I needed to use so used mostly apples and pineapple with the exception of a few grated carrot. I added an extra tsp. of cinnamon; didn't have nuts. After I got the batter made I felt it lacked a little something....back to the crisper. Lo and behold there was an orange that was just waiting to be rubbed against the microplane. I added the zest of the entire orange. The combination of apple pineapple carrot cinnamon and the orange zest was perfect! I could smell the cinnamon and zest while baking. I didn't overdo the coconut; added just the 3/4 cup as I have found that when I overdo it on coconut to sweet breads it tends to be crumbly. These were perfect. The recipe made 12 Texas-sized muffins and baked for 25 minutes at 375. They look like a picture with the different colors and bits. I didn't peel the apples..just grated it right in...love the faint pinkish red color it gives the muffin. I was tempted to sub applesauce for the oil but didn't...that would make it even more healthy.",

In my effort to make them \"healthier\" here are my subs:In place of one of the 2 cups of flour I use 1/2 c. of whole wheat flour 1/2 c. of oat bran and 1 TBSP of wheat germ. In place of the 1/2 c. of oil I use 1/4 c. and 1/4 c. plain lowfat yogurt. In place of the 1-1/4 c. sugar I use 3/4 c of sugar and 1/4 c of honey. Other changes: use golden raisins in place of the dates. I add a dash of cloves and a couple dashes of nutmeg. Instead of grating the apples (I use Granny Greensmith) I chop them finely. Sometimes I even add a small can of drained crushed pineapple!",

They went incredibly fast as we all for them as a snack throughout the day, but they only got more moist as they sat. Thanks for the recipe.",

Replaced sugar with Splenda for baking. Also made 12 not 18 muffins. I used pre-shredded carrots but I think I would have been better off shredding them myself- it threw off the texture a bit. Slightly undercooked in the middle of the bigger ones but that's my fault. They are delish and I imagine they're pretty good for you with my modifications.",

I only added 3/4 cup sugar instead of the 1 1/4 cups and next time I will try with only 1/2 cup sugar. They were quite sweet with the 3/4 cup! I also didn't have coconut on hand so I omitted that (without replacing with anything) and they were still delish. I omitted the vanilla b/c I didn't want these to be overly cake-tasting. Finally I used olive oil instead of veg oil - works a treat! Note that the batter is SUPER THICK - I was worried at first! But they turned out beautifully.",
