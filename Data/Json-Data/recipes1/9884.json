We used Texas Toast type bread and it came out delicious.  A few notes: You must mix/whisk the egg mixture before dipping new bread in the mixture, because the cinnamon rises to the top and will disappear with your first few slices made if you don't kep mixing as you go.  Also, I find that Butter Flavor Crisco works well for frying these; it produces an even golden appearance and when new butter is added to the hot pan as you make successive pieces, it does not burn/get dark like butter or margarine can.  (I also use Butter Crisco to make grilled cheese.  Sounds weird, maybe, but tastes and looks great.)  I also added a little nutmeg to the mixture the second time I made this.  The leftover French toast can be stored in the fridge or freezer and reheats well (nice and crispy on the outside) in the toaster.",

In reading a LOT of reviews last night, the common theme seemed to be to double the vanilla and the cinnamon so I did, and I also took another reviewer's suggestion and added a Tablespoon of brown sugar, along with the Tablespoon of white sugar.  The results were PERFECT!!  Just got done eating some for breakfast this morning and had to post a review right away, so good!!!  UPDATE (5/30/12):  This recipe is now a FAMILY FAVORITE!  I use Texas Toast and found that if you triple this recipe, it will make 2 loaves (30 slices) total.  I make it this way and then freeze all the slices that don't get eaten at breakfast... would you believe that these taste even BETTER after they've been frozen??  I just pop them in the toaster until they are heated through and they are PERFECT!  A great tasty homemade quick breakfast... these are now a staple in our freezer!  My kids love to eat these as french toast sticks.  After I reheat them, I cut them into 4 or 5 strips and then they dip them in maple syrup.  UPDATE (12/19/13):  Just when I didn't think this recipe could get any better, I used Kirkland (Costco) brand Cinnamon bread... AMAZING!!!",

It really made a difference. In my opinion this recipe is way better than the restaurants. I pretty much followed the instructions although I eye balled the measurement of the ingredients and omitted the salt. The toast turned out golden brown on the outside, moist and fluffy on the inside...As others mentioned you have to let your bread soak briefly in the mixture to absorb some of the liquid flavor. DON'T just dunk and take out immediately. To avoid soggy toast do not cook too fast on high heat. Cook on medium heat until golden brown on each side...After the toast are done I usually sift powered sugar on top and serve with warm syrup. The presentation just looks pretty.",
