To avoid the \"mushy\" comments I sauted the onions and garlic in the artichoke marinade and cooked it until almost all the juice was gone. I also increased the oregano to 1/4 teaspoon and used seasoned fine bread crumbs instead of plain. Also increased the cooking time by 5-10 minutes or until the top started to brown. The results were fantastic. No mushy artichoke bites here! And I microwaved them for 1 min. 10 seconds to reheat. Perfect. Got numerous compliments from party I attended last night and my husband LOVED them. This one's a keeper and so easy!!",

Also I'd suggest decreasing the amount of onions and then sauteeing them in butter or olive oil instead of the marinade...it seemed to give the dish an odd tangy flavor. Other than that the bites were a little bland for my taste. Maybe adding more garlic more seasoning and some parmesan cheese would help.
