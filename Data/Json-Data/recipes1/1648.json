Whisk together whole eggs and sugar until the liquid becomes light yellow and foamy. This means the chemical reaction is almost equivalent to beating the egg whites in the end batter. It is also easier that way when you mix in the dry ingredients to the batter because there is always enough liquids. I also pour the juice from the can on the cake after taking it out of the oven. It makes it so moist and even more pineapple cake.",

I had the brilliant idea of making this in a bundt pan. Don't Do It!! Unless you want to spend 10 minutes shaking banging cussing and finally pleading with your cake to come out of the pan.
