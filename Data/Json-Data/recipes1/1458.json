I think there is too much milk in the recipe so the cookies were very thin. Also the frosting needs improvement. At a minimum the white frosting needs some butter and vanilla to make it more than just powdered sugar and water. My daughter did not like her cookie and several of the other kids did not eat theirs either.",
