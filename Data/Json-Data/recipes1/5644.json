Since I didn't have any semi-sweet chocolate chips I used milk chocolate chips instead. I also used 3 tbsps of HOT water. To top it off I chilled the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes. Boy was I glad I did all of this! The cookies turned out great with the changes and not flat at all unlike some people's reviews. I suggest that you bake it for at least 10 minutes if you want nice and chewy almost cake-like cookies. If you like your cookies more on the \"rough\" side than I suggest you bake it for 12 minutes. Hope my review helps you out!",

My only changes were as follows; substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the white and used 1/4 cup semi-sweet and 1/4 cup milk chocolate chunks in place of the chips. I molded these into round balls and used parchment - the cookies flattened out quite quickly into perfect 1/3 inch thick rounds so I wouldn't suggest flattening them at all before baking. I checked my batch after about 8 minutes but ended up baking for about 12. Crispy on the outside chewy on the inside not too sweet and even a slight reduction in fat compared to regular cookies.. I'll make these again!",

This was my first ever successful batch of chocolate chip cookies!

They were chewy, puffy and soft - AND LOW FAT! i will definately make these again. Thanks Megan!",
