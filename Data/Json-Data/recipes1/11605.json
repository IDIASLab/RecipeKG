It's just a wonderful old-fashioned type of cookie that has perhaps (undeservedly) gone out of style. My only tip would be to hold off making the icing until you're good and ready to frost the cooled cookies. The icing wants to set up fast - which is a plus when you're in a baking frenzy and want to get the cookies stored as soon as possible.",

The \"dough\" was more like a cross between dough and batter and that worried me a bit...but the cookies came out high and light. I used a #52 portion scoop (1 1/3 tablespoons) and netted 78 cookies. The amount of icing was dead on for the number of cookies.",
