I only used about 1/2 lb of pasta (I used vermicelli) but I left the rest of the ingredient amounts the same as the full recipe. There was just too much pasta compared to sauce in the full recipe. This was easy to make while my husband was outside grilling the skewers. My 10 year old really liked this dish - he asked me to make it again as just the main dish even. I saved the leftovers for lunch tomorrow - I think it will be just as good as a cold salad.",

There was still a slight texture to the spinach. I also added crushed almonds. In the health food section I found a toasted sesame oil (used in a lot of stir frys) that had a nutty flavor to it. This was a great last minute pasta salad since you don't have to let the flavors set by putting it in the refrigerator for several hours. I added red and yellow peppers to the stir fry too.
