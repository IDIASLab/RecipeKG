I let the dough rise one hour cut into 12 rolls let rise another hour and baked at 375 for 12 minutes. I make bread almost every day and this is one of the best I've found!",

I then added the melted butter and then the dry ingredents. I had to add about another half cup of flour to get the dough into a ball and jump on the hook. I kneaded it with the dough hook for five minutes then set it to rise in a greased covered bowl for a hour. After it had doubled I formed it into a loaf and let it rise again in the loaf pan another fourty-five minutes or so. I baked it at 350 for about a half hour. This bread had the texture of a beer bread. Chewy and dense. You could really taste the yeast if that makes sense. My husband ate over half of the loaf on his own and my kids each ate two pieces. Good bread. NOTE: I appreciate you posting this recipe just for the title. My son lost his Grampy three years ago and pines for him still. When I saw this title I had to make it. Please thank your Grampy for sharing his bread recipe and make sure you hug him from my son. He was quite touched by this.",

This is a good old fashioned everyday white bread great for sandwiches or just to put out with supper. Light tender interior but still sturdy and with a crackly crust just how I like it! I used butter rather than margarine 1-1/2 teaspoons of bread machine yeast and 2% milk but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written using the bread machine. Just the slightest specks of the Rice Krispies show which made it extra pretty. Loved it. Grampy did himself proud!",

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and the buns came out GREAT!!! The only thing I added was brushing the buns w/ butter when I first took them out of the oven. We didn't have one was left! Update I make these all the time now. I've made these by hand and in the breadmaker and either way it comes out great.. it just depends on if I have time to do it by hand or not. Also I use a muffin tin to bake them in... I roll the dough into small 1 inch balls and put 3 balls in each muffin tin let it rise for about 30 to 40 mins than baked at 375 for about 20 mins or until the tops are golden brown. I still brush the tops w/ a stick of butter right when it comes out of the oven for a shiney golden look to each roll. It looks like a beautiful clover. It's VERY pretty! I'm making these for Thanksgiving and hope to impress my inlaws! Thanks Grampy!",
