What you need: One square shaped pan&one round pan the 9x9(I think)and try to devide evenly. Then when its done just cut the circle in 1/2 and line the halves with the corners of the square(so the square looks like a diamond then it will look exactly like a heart unless you cut the circle unevenly!!!mwahahahaha )So there you go yes I have done this and it worked great!!!Could use only ol' cake recipe for it don't really matter!!!
