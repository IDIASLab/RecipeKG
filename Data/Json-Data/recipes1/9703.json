I had defrosted a couple pounds of shrimp and wasn't sure what to make but knew I wanted something scampi-like. I had leftover chicken broth in the fridge so I decided to try this. I used more chicken broth than called for and skipped the red pepper flakes but added lemon juice to the broth. I also used more garlic too (minced from jar) and mixed the garlic butter in with the broth. I poured it over rice and added spinach for a scrumptious shrimp \"soup\". I can see this being fabulous for pasta too. The simmering really kept the shrimp tender. I'll be making this again!",
