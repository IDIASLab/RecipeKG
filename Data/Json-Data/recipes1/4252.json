I also used 3oz cream cheese that I sweetened and added vanilla. This I put on the bottom and sides of my baked pie crust then add the fruit mixture on top. I peeled the fruit like you would an apple removing the outer membrane. Then placing the knife along the inner membrane slice to the center and simply push the section out. Very easy fast and nothing but fruit. I can't wait to try this recipe with oranges and strawberry jello. UPDATE 3/10/07 Made this with oranges, peach jello, no sugar and a little lemon juice to give it a sweet/sour taste. It was fabulous!",

There was NO juice dripping after sitting for four hours. Had to use prepared grapefruit juice which worked fine. The only change I made was to use lemon jello because that's what I had on hand. I've since had the strawberry and prefer lemon. Everyone at the office thought this was a most unusual presentation and really liked it. I'll do this frequently.",

However I took on board the reviewer's comment regarding the grapefruit membranes and decided to get rid of them as well as the pith. Well with 4 large grapefruits this took a LONG time (and I didn't even need all of the flesh. Three fruits would have been enough). I then made the jello filling as directed. Once cooled it was extremely thick and rubbery and the pie was very difficult to eat. If I were to make this again I would omit the cornstarch and cut the grapfruit into much smaller pieces perhaps even crush it a little.",
