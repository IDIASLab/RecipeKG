When I saw this one and the other positive reviews it had gotten I decided to try it. I was amazed at how much this tasted like my mother's bread pudding recipe. There is no need to adjust this recipe. The amount of each ingredient is as it should be. I did adjust this recipe myself because of the ingredients I had on hand not because of anything in the recipe. Instead of using french bread I used a bag of leftover potato rolls that my family never ate. I also didn't have a 1/2 cup (1 stick) of butter because I forgot to buy butter. I only had a half of a stick of regular (not unsalted) butter so that's what I used. Everything else was the same. Some people suggest that you let the bread soak in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before baking to ensure that the bread soaks up all the liquid. I pushed down the bread into the mixture until it was mostly soaked up. It only took about 5 minutes and the bread pudding still turned out great. Just like home. Thank you Sanatacruz for an excellent recipe.",
