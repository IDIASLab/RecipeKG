The bread crumbs I used in this recipe were made from homemade garlic-butter croutons and I cut back on the salt just a bit. To make uniform meat balls, I used my small cookie scoop. After baking my meatballs, I drained the fat off of them and added them to a homemade marinara and let them sit in the sauce for 20 minutes or so before I served them on pasta. The family really thought these were quite good. They held up well (to both cooking in the oven and sitting in the marinara) and had a nice flavor. Next time, I'd double the italian seasoning but that's really just personal to our family.",

These beat 'Meatball Nirvana' And they held up too!\" So my biggest praise for these meatballs is that after I made a double-batch, w/o changing the recipe, I froze them into weekly portions, but after thawing a handful of them in sauce last night, I couldn't have been more delighted that they held their meatball shape and didn't fall apart! So I don't know what of CJ's method, or ingredients, resulted in a firm (oh yes, and scrumptious!) meatball, but I think this recipe has replaced AR's 'Meatball Nirvana' in our house from now on.",

I prefer to mix the bread crumbs with milk in a large bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes then mix in the eggs, parsley, parmesan cheese, the saut\u00e9ed onions with garlic and all of the dry seasonings into this bowl. In a separate large bowl, I mix the beef and pork together then mix the contents of the previous bowl into the bowl of meat and place it into the fridge for an hour or so before forming the meatballs. I think that by doing so \u2013 everything mixes together more evenly. I find it impossible to mix the beef and pork together without using your hands, same goes for mixing the meat with the remaining ingredients. I didn\u2019t notice any toughness in the meatballs by doing it my way. I\u2019ve heard numerous times to not work ground beef too much otherwise the meat will turn tough. I don\u2019t believe that myth. I use an ice cream scoop to form the meatballs and pack them into balls with wet hands. I added half of the cooked meatballs to a simmering pot of marina sauce and finished simmering them in the sauce for an hour. The remaining meatballs were put in a freezer bag and frozen for later use.",

I was scared b/c the mixture was so soft (even after refrigeration), but I proceeded on, and I am so glad I didn't add extra breadcrumbs like I wanted to...these held their shape and were so moist, tender, flavorful and delicious...one of the best I've made/eaten! I used my large cookie scoop and got 26 out of this recipe. My family RAVED over these...even my 10 month old twins couldn't get enough, lol. Seriously, these are sooooo good!

Just a couple of things: I think next time I'll use maybe a 1/3 cup of milk as they were almost too juicy to form into balls.  Also, next time I will try baking them with a rack in the pan as they really did make a lot of grease and I think they would taste better without sitting in it.  Third, I wish they would have browned up a little better.  I even kept them in the oven for a few more mintutes at 450 and that didn't help.  But, again, the best tasting meatballs I've ever made.
