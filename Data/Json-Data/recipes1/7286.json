I substituted Cream of Broccoli. I seasoned 4 boneless pork chops with an all purpose greek seasoning and then browned them in olive oil. When they were nice and brown I deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup of white wine. To this I added a small can of portabello mushroom chunks and a 1/4 cup of chicken broth and reduced it down slightly. I then added the Cream of Broccoli soup covered and simmered for about 20 minutes. The pork was tender and the gravy was wonderful on mashed potatoes.",
