I used Instant Jamaican Coffee as opposed to regular and I piped (for added height) the cookies onto my pan before I tossed them in the oven and they had a fabulous texture when they finished. Crispy on the outside & tender and chewy on the inside. They melted in your mouth and the guests I served them to had nothing but rave reviews for them. This is definitely going to be added to my holiday fav list!",

I'm not sure what went wrong I followed the directions exactly and I mixed the ingredients for an hour (45 minutes by hand 15 with an automatic mixer) but stiff peaks NEVER formed. So as a result the meringues were flat and airy like strange cookies. Maybe because I'm at a high altitude (7500 feet) but I wasn't sure how to adjust. Still they tasted good.",

I doubled the recipe used 1 T. of the cocoa and instead used 1 T. instant cappacino mix toffee flavor. Also I didn't use any sugar but four packets of artificial sweetener instead. The cookies were flat airy light and did melt in your mouth. I would probably up the sugar next time while keeping everything else I changed the same. I would make them again. I have been dieting and these are great for a nice chocolate treat. I ate them with a little light whipped cream and they were great!",
