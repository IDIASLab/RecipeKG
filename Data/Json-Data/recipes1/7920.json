The reviews commented that it was more airy than your standard bar and had light pumpkin flavor; I like a lot of pumpkin so I used a whole can of pumpkin (about double what the recipe calls for) and compensated with an extra 1/4 c of flour and only half the amount of oil.  The result:  very dense and pumpkiny, very delicious.  I also added 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/2 c of walnuts as recommended.",

I made the recipe as is and mine was done by 30 min. I didn't have maple syrup so I just used powdered sugar and water and lightly drizzled it on top. This cake is very light so cutting them into bars won't work. I just made them into little cake squares. My kids loved them. Good simple recipe for an everyday dessert.
