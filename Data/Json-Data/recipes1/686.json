It's a huge time saver and it's really easy. I just used a small one that attached to my blender so you don't need a big fancy one. Also when you bake them don't use a convection overn. I did and my cookies didn't turn out as crunchy as I had hoped. This is a great recipe I'm definately making these again!",

I've found it easiest to do that part with my fingers but if you do clean and dry your fingers often or the cookies will stick to them making the cookies impossible to handle.",
