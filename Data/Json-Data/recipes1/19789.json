This recipe is great for kids' taste buds, but can be 'Mitch'ed' up, as my wife would call it, to suit the more refined taste buds of the adults in the house. Serve on a paper plate with favorite potato chips or have Mom make your favorite macaroni or potato salad.",

Loved the selling point but I have to point out that this dinner wasn't really as 'super' as the name suggests. I was hoping to find some added directions as to how to 'Mitch' up the recipe (as the author's wife would call it) to 'suit the more refined taste buds of adults ' but none was found. Still a decent enough recipe and not too difficult to produce. The best part was that the kids can help.",

It was super salty (and I LOVE salt) and kind of a PITA to assemble/keep together. Hot dogs are meant to be grilled or roasted over an open fire (though I didn't go into this recipe w/that frame of mind). I didn't eat more than a few bites and even Mr. LTH left quite a bit behind. While it bears no impact on my rating I also find the tagline semi-offensive (have MOM make you....). I appreciate the novel approach but it wasn't for us. THANKS for the recipe!",

The boiled dog was MUCH better because pan frying or grilling even bring out all that saltiness in the hotdogs overpoweringly so in this case. Probably won't make again but it was a fun try.
