                "reviewBody": "Wow!  What a fabulous recipe.  I feared the maple flavor would be too strong and these would taste like pancakes- but that wasn't the case at all.  I used the real maple syrup (not pancake syrup) and the end result was a rich, cinnamony sweet cookie.  Fantastic.  This recipe is a keeper!  I've made these cookies several times now and I had to make a few changes to the recipe.  I really like my cookies to be soft and cinnamony, so I used 3 tablespoons ground cinnamon in the dough, and instead of 1 cup of white sugar I changed it to 3/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar for the dough.  I also used crisco butter flavored shortening sticks in place of magragine, as shortening doesn't spread as much.  I also never use all of the flour mixture- I blend in enough to make sure the dough is soft, not sticky, and I end up throwing about 1/4 cup of it away.  This has happened everytime I make them- if I use all of the flour, the cookies turn into dry 'rocks'.\r\n\r\nMake sure everything is blended REALLY REALLY REAllY well and do NOT OVERBAKE- I take them out as soon as they look like they're hard enough on top but still \"wet\" in the middle.  If you slice a cookie open right after I take it out of the oven, it doesn't look done in the middle, but if you wait until the cookie cools to take it off of the cookie sheet, it sets up and the result is a cookie that stays soft for DAYS.  Thanks again for such a wonderful recipe! :)",

I didn't have maple sugar so rolled the cookies in 2 Tbsp. of sugar mixed with 2 tsp of cinnamon. The best snickerdoodles I have ever tasted. Chewy and soft. Even my fiancee who hates cinnamon thought it was delicious.  Didn't give me three dozen, only two. But then again I make my cookies kind of big. Enjoy the recipe fellow bakers!!",

I didn't look for maple sugar just used a regular sugar and cinnamon mixture. I think next time I will make the effort and look for the maple sugar. As soon as they cooled I froze them so I'm not sure how chewy they stay yet. They're really great warm though! REVISED NOTE- This year I made the effort and found the maple sugar. It was EXPENSIVE but the difference it made in the taste of the cookie was so pronounced it was worth it. Fantastic!",

These are pretty little cookies chewy and soft both. Buttery good not too sweet and nicely spiced with just the perfect amount of cinnamon. But it is the maple syrup (I used Grade B for boldest flavor) and the maple sugar that truly make this an exceptional cookie. The dough too is beautiful and cooperative - it's easy to work with and does just want you want it to. Other than substituting butter for the margarine I followed the recipe as written and found it produced a perfect cookie. Hubs who typically prefers very rich desserts loved these. He also never rates any recipe five stars - but he did with these. I love it when we both agree!",

I couldn't find the maple sugar so I put a few drops maple extract in a sealed container with 1/4 cup white sugar. I shook it for about 15 minutes. Then I poured in 1/2 cup white sugar. There were a few lumps and it was wet sugar until I added the white sugar. I only shook that unitl just mixed. I'm sure it's not as good as maple sugar but it'll do in a pinch. I think these'll be a staple of my Christmas cookie baking!!",

I have never made them so I searched and found this recipe. They melt in your mouth with a satisfyingly crunchy outside. I did not have maple sugar so I used a mix of white sugar brown sugar and a small amount on cinnamon to roll them in. I also stirred about 1 tsp of pure maple syrup into the sugar mixture. Not sure if it helped but it worked! Also I do NOT use margarine for anything so I just used the same amount of melted butter. I always use melted butter in recipes - it's the secret to soft cookies!

This recipe was my choice as there is no milk used in the batter. One of my guests was milk and corn allergic so I used a soy based corn absent \"butter\". VERY EASY to make and no fuss since I was also making a lot of other more complicated dishes. The first test batch I made I thought that I did something wrong as the cookies were so moist on the insides that I had a hard time removing them from the cookie sheet. Each batch afterwards I chilled the dough for an hour or so before baking as I felt without it it would be a bit to sticky for me to get a dollop off my fingers and onto the tray! This I feel helped out greatly and I realized that the joy of this cookie is the slightly chewy middle! This recipe was a HUGE success! Despite the fact that only one person at the shower had ever heard of a Snickerdoodle more than half the guests have requested this recipe even with the soy products that I used! Just Yummy pure yummy!!",

Read reviews before making and was prepared for dough to be a little dry and to cook them a little longer than suggested other than that...no problems. I will definitely make them again. Oh yeah I didn't buy the maple sugar too expensive and none of my stores had maple extract so I used the maple syrup in the sugar and tasted fine to me! TASTY they are! I took them to a cookie swap where there were at least 12 other cookies and at least one person liked these the best! Is there a tweak to make them stay soft and chewy like when they come right out the oven?",
