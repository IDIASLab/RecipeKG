I think perhaps next time, I'll add some mushrooms or green peppers. The extra noodles gave this more substance, the increased tomato sauce made this not so dry and the additional spices gave this a mild kick. Other than those additions/changes, I did follow the recipe (kept the corn, garlic powder etc...) This is a recipe that is very easy to adjust to your tastes.",

Especially if you're using tomato sauce from the can, spices need to be added or else it has that 'metalic' taste to it. I browned my beef with the recommended amount of onion and added some diced green pepper and minced garlic.  I also left out the corn. Then I added more garlic powder, sea salt, pepper, an Italian seasoning bland (about a teaspoon), paprika, and a few pinches of sugar. Then I added the cooked pasta (used shells, and way more than the half cup), and added fresh diced tomatoes. I let that simmer for about five minutes then transferred the mixture to a baking dish and topped with large tomato slices and mozzarella cheese.  I baked it at 350 for about 25 minutes.  Turned out great this way.",

I used Sun Dried Tomatoe Sauce (as it already has big chunks of tomatoe in it so I wouldn't have to use the stewed tomatoes) I added purple onion (becauce I find them sweet and flavorful) I also used a few dashs of Franks Red Hot Chicken Wing Sauce a few Tblp Brown Sugar and a few dashs of Black Bean sauce as well as lots of garlic. Basically I made my usual Spahgetti sauce. (I didn't use any corn because that sounds a little strange to me!) I used Rotini instead of maccaroni because I find that the sauce sticks better to it. I then assembled it like a casserole. A layer of cooked pasta half the meat sauce a layer of grated aged cheddar cheese repeat. I then baked it at 350 for about 25 mins till it was all hot and bubbly and melted. Very yummy!!! We had it with ceasar salad and fresh french bread. Mmmmm! My boyfriend had 3 helpings and ended up moaning on the couch uncomfortably full. LoL I'll deffinetly make it again.",

Your recipe filled my requirements so we had it last night for dinner. Everyone enjoyed it but I think my food snob hubby actually liked it the best. This is not our usual fare but it was very yummy and just what we needed last night. I tripled the noodles called for and added more tomato sauce because of that thus lowering the meat per serving ratio. I omitted the corn just because I wasnt in the mood but would try it in the future. This was a very simple recipe fast and easy thank you for sharing. Bunny Foo Foo",

I pretty much followed it up to the end aside from using ground turkey in place of the beef but once I tasted it I NEEDED to add something.
