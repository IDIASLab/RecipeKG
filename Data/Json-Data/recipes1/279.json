You can see in the picture I submitted that I used gumdrop slices and almond slivers for the leaves and stems. There is a similar recipe on this site that uses butter instead of oil but I find the butter makes the cookie halves spread too much - I like to use a combination of both. Neither of the fillings are very appetizing to me so I've been using a chocolate ganache to fill these (2 parts chocolate to 1 part heavy cream). I find this recipe to be a LOT of work - but I really like it for special occasions.",

I used Mint leaves for the stems. I made my own colored sugar by dropping a few drops of food coloring into a cup of sugar and mixing with my fingers..be sure to use a glove or plastic bag over your hand or your hands will be the same color as the sugar. I was a little nervous about the filling but followed the recipe to the letter and it tasted fabulous. After people realized they were cookies they could stop talking about how good they were.

Mine were a miserable representation to say the least: (. So the 3 rating is for the difficulty in the presentation. However I really did like the flavor and would have rated it a 4 or 5 for that! Since others mentioned the cookie was \"tasteless\" I did add some nutmeg to the dough. I think it tasted great that way. I used peach preserves since they look like peaches made sense to me! I did use the instant tea as well - peach flavor (it contained some sugar substitute as I could not find any that didn't have some type of sweetner in it). I also coated the cookies in peach jello dyed with some red food coloring. I might try these again but may just give up on making them into \"peaches\" and just have them as a standard sandwich cookie - unless some other reviewers pass along their tips on how to make them successfully!",
