I told that I have never attempted making chocolate chip cookies before but I will try. I searched for a recipe and found this one. I followed some of the suggestions and added a lit more oats. I didn't eat any cause at the time I was following a weight loss program. The next day when I came back home from work. My boyfriends son greeted me and told me that he finished all the cookies but left two for me (he didn't know that I was on a diet). When I asked him how he enjoyed the cookes he simply answered beautiful. At his response I decided to forget about the diet and try the cookies. Didn't regret it one bit.",

Also I greased my sheets just in case cos I didn't want to have to fight to get them off. Also I added about 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon at the end and that was a good addition.

At first I thought I did something wrong then I looked closer at the reviews. With my last sheet I made the cookies larger and they sat up a little better. Nonetheless I thought they were too sweet and crunchy in the wrong sort of way. I recommend \"Chewy Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Cookies\" from this site. especially if you chill the dough a couple hours before baking and add an extra 1/4 to 1/2 cup of flour. They're not picture-perfect either but they stand up better than these and aren't so sweet or toasty/crunchy.",
