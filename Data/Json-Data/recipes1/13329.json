It's a great way to start the day and when you add in some sausage and cheese....well it's downright tasty. I usually use milk or a bit of half and half to achieve fluffy scrambled eggs, but this was recipe called for a bit too much. I used a bit less than 1/2 cup vs. 3/4 cup. I also like to add just pinch of onion and garlic powders plus a little salt and pepper. I used Cheddar cheese and served it with whole grain toast and \"Home-Fried Potatoes\" from this site. Next time, I might place every thing inside a warrm tortilla for a great breakfast wrap!",
