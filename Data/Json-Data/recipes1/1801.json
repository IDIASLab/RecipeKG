The only thing is that every time I make it I have to ad about 1/4 cup of water, otherwise the cake does not look like a cake batter. Nevertheless, it turns out AWESOME and MOIST!!! Thanks Carla!~~",

This recipe uses far less oil than most recipes of this variety and I believe that's because it uses double the carrot (zucchini/apple) that other recipes do. The result is a super moist yet not heavy cake. Two things that need a little tinkering. First is sugar - 2 cups is WAY too much. I found 1-1/2 cups to be perfect. The second is the spice. As written it was inadequate to my palate. I would up the cinnamon to 3 tsp (or one TB ) the nutmeg is fine when using apple but I'd add 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp cloves as well and get rid of the nutmeg altogether if using only zucchini and/or carrot (meaning when apple is not used.) The 40 minute timing was dead-on in my meticulously calibrated oven using a 9\"X13\" pan. Frosted it when cool with a not-too-sweet cream cheese frosting.",

I recommend that you put a little salt on the zuchinni and let the zuchinni sit for 20-25 minutes. This will get some of the water out of the zuchinni, making a lighter bread.

It's also sickeningly sweet. I used only one and a half cups of sugar and it was so sweet that just one bite left me with an unpleasant aftertaste of sugar in my mouth for the rest of the day. I made the apple version of this cake for an office party and the only way I could console myself for the embarrassment I endured was with the thought of writing a negative review later.
