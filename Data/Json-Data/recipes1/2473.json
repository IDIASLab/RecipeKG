It's best if you knead the dough for a few minutes before the 1st rise, which should be about 60 to 90 minutes, not 30 as stated.  The 2nd rise may take longer than 30 minutes ie 45 or 50.  Rather than pulverise the cornmeal in the blender I used a fine cornmeal that I bought at the Italian grocers.",

You might too especially if you are a big fan of soup; I think it would be really good with a tomato-based soup. 7-2-2006: I made this again. This time I kneaded it more; it rose higher and was lighter than the last time I made it.",
