I had shredded 4-cheese Mexican blend on hand plus shredded parmesan so I made 1/2 the recipe and weighed out 4oz of mixed cheese. I had walnuts on hand so used those - you get the picture. They're so good. That dash of cayenne pepper really perks them up. I'm thinking of making them with 1/2 cheddar & 1/2 cream cheese. I love to experiment. PS: Sprinkle a few drops of water on the cookie sheet. Helps hold the parchment in place.",
