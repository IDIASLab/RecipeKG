I've made close to 50 different types of breads in my bread machine and I have never had one turn out so horrible as this one. I put it at the light crust setting and it came out burnt and had a terrible burnt sour tomato smell as it was baking. It didn't rise at all (I measured and it was only 3.5 inches high). As I made it I wondered how it was going to rise without any sugar. I took only one bite and had to throw out the rest and the horrible taste wouldn't go away until I ate something sweet.",
