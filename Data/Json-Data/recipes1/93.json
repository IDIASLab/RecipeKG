I actually let them bubble a minute or so and would let them bubble longer the next time so they would set up a little firmer, but that's just a consistency preference of mine.  I added an extra 1/2 c. peanut butter to the double batch as I love peanut butter and for the topping, I melted 2 Hershey milk chocolate bars and drizzled them over the top.  I used the rice cereal, but think I may try them with corn flakes the next time.  They're a delicious addictive sort of treat.",
