Had this very dish a few months ago when a neighbor shared with us. Hubby gobbled it up, but probably wasn\u2019t aware it was Kielbasa. He\u2019ll devour any kind of sausage but wrinkles his nose at ones with foreign names like bratwurst and kielbasa. It\u2019s a head thing, not a taste thing. Made this about as written except used only 1lb. sausage to 2lbs. cabbage. I like a lot of cabbage. Didn\u2019t saut\u00e9 the onions or brown a thing. (The kielbasa was fully cooked anyway.) Threw it all in the crockpot. I mixed up melted butter, the red wine vinegar the salt, pepper. The red pepper flakes as some others mentioned were a nice addition for a kick too. Poured the seasonings over everything in the crock. I added quite a bit more water for the crock to cook all day. Also I\u2019ve got nothing against potatoes, but I left them out, cause try as I might, with corned beef and cabbage and the likes, I am always disappointed with the dratted starchy flavor, texture and taste they impart to my beloved, melt in your mouth, cabbage. Guess I\u2019m a purist. It was easy and delicious. Hubby loved it too. Good comfort meal. Good with cornbread to sop up the juices.",

I couldn't find savoy cabbage so I used green cabbage. Cook time is a little longer than per recipe probably because I used green cabbage instead. BF loved the dish. To me it was just A-OK. The red wine vinegar threw me off a bit but still tasty. I probably won't make this dish again. I will probably go for recipe that doesn't call for vinegar next time.",
