I then combined the butter and brown sugar and used a pastry cutter and cut the butter into the sugar until well combined. It seems to do better this way then to melt the butter. Next I separated the egg yokes and added the yokes to the mixture but I beat the egg whites to a stiff peak then added to mixture and mixed very well. Always be sure raisins have completely cooled. NOTES: In this recipe I used real butter not marg. as you can actually see the difference in the finished desert if you use marg.",

I know there are a lot of people who don\u2019t like raisins (we do!).  However, I think Craisins\u00ae would work equally well in this recipe, as would pecans if you have no walnuts.  I scaled the recipe in half and ended up with 12  mini pies.  Followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using Truvia\u00ae Baking Blend instead of sugar to get the calories down.  I set the timer for 28 minutes, and I think they were just a bit overcooked, so next time, I\u2019ll start checking for doneness at 24  minutes.  Yes, they are \u201cmini,\u201d but their taste is not, it\u2019s \u201cbig.\u201d  Quick, easy, buttery, and tasty!",
