I had to reduce the baking time to 7 min. and even then they were still very dark on the bottom. If I took them out at 6 min. they weren't done. I even tried reducing the baking temp. to 350 but they still burned. The taste (when they weren't burnt) was ok but nothing special. The cookies also crumbled trying to get them off the cookie sheet unless I let them sit for a few minutes. Overall not a great recipe...I won't be making these again.",
