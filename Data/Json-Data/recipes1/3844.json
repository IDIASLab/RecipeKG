I used a food processor to chop the spinach and then added the water, egg, and flour and blended the dough.  This saved on pans/prep time.  I plan to do it this way again next time, however, I will omit the water or add more flour in order to create a more dry dough.  Otherwise- flavor was very good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

I rolled out by hand and cut with my pizza cutter (without rolling first).  I let air dry for a bit and then bundled into individual serving sizes, placed on a parchment lined baking sheet and froze (placed in plastic bags once frozen).  To cook, I got my water good and boiling and dropped the pasta in frozen, it took mine just a bit over 3 min to cook.  I loved it but found it too thick, I may need to invest in a pasta machine to get it thin enough :-)  Cant wait to try this again!  Its such a pretty green color!",
