I also sauteed some diced celery, onions, and bell pepper in bacon fat before adding the soup. I thinned mine with both milk and water and used more than the recipe called for. The last thing I did that was different was take the browned bits of flour after pan frying the gizzards and livers and making a gravy which I added to the soup mixture. I let it simmer for a very long time then served over rice. At some point it actually reminded me a bit of giblet gravy although I never added sage...",
