I use 4 cups of chicken broth instead of boullion and water. I also omit the califlower brocoli and carrots. The onion and potato are perfect for this type of soup plus the leftovers don't get soggy. I recommend using a beer that doesn't have a bitter aftertaste. The darker the better for true beer cheese soup flavor. This recipe freezes well. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good beer cheese soup.",
