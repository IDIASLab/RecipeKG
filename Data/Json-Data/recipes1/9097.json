On the side I tore off fresh bread into cube or smaller size and poured chicken broth on it. You want the bread completely covered but not drenched. Then mix the bread in the pan and cook on medium keep turning every few 5 mintues letting the mix get a little golden brown. Again I added some more butter about 2-3 tablespoons and some salt and pepper. Afterwards add to the bird or cook in the oven. I found in the bird the stuffing was moist alone it was more dry. So you may want to add a bit more broth before cooking in oven if you are doing it out of bird. Which is the way I preferred it. P.S. Use sweet onions for this dish. I actually didn't try the egg substitute.",
