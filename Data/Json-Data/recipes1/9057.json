I used all turkey and instant mashed potatoes and it still came out perfect. The instant potatoes really saved a lot of time and trouble without sacrificing taste. It was a little underseasoned so i would suggest that you do what i did- add garlic powder. Along with the other veggies i added a small can of sliced mushrooms which i love and added some nice texture. I took the advice of other people who reviewed the recipe and put in 3 tablespoons of tomato paste. It really was delicious and i will definitely make this over and over again.",

I used ground turkey and lean ground pork that I had on hand but next time I think I will use all ground (lean) beef so that it's not so dry. I left off the cheese as the Shepherd's Pie I had in Ireland didn't have any - I think it's more authentic that way.

I had leftover potatoes and carrots soaking in beef broth from the hideous diasater of a roast I made last week. The beef was too tough so I gave it to the dogs and saved the rest. I took the potatoes and mashed them for the topping. The carrots were diced and used in the meat mixture. I use 1/3 lb of 95% lean beef 1/3 lb italian pork sausage and 1/2 lb of ground turkey. I added garlic salt/pepper black pepper more garlic powder worchester sauce a small white onion and some frozen peas. Heat that on the skillet (no oil b/c the beef and pork gives plenty of it). I put it in a 375 preheated oven for 25 mins. It was FABULOUS!",

When I followed the recipe I ended up with about a 2:1 ratio of potatoes to meat/veggie mixture. Being that I am a huge fan of mashed potatoes you might be surprised to know that I plan to reverse this ratio the next time I make this because the flavor of the meat/veggie mix was so good. Having so many potatoes sort of dulled the impact of the spicy mix.",
