It requires a few minutes more of preparation, but everytime I serve it, it receives rave reviews.  Soften an 8 oz. brick of cream cheese in the bottom of a glass pie plate for 30 seconds in the microwave. Spread in the bottom of the plate and then layer the refried beans, salsa and shredded Mexican style cheese on top of the cream cheese.  Return to the microwave and heat between 1-2 minutes or until the cheese on top is melted.  Serve with tortilla chips.  The shredded Mexican style cheese is available in the dairy section of the supermarket and usually consists of 2-3 different cheeses shredded together.  It's truly addictive!",

I garnished the top with some chopped green onions and sliced  black olives and served it with tortilla chips. I received many compliments! Thanks! Will make again for sure.",
