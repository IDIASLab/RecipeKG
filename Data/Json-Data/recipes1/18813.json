When I make it again I would use half the amount of onions and celery and saut\u00e9 them in the butter before adding the flour. In addition to lighten up the recipe and get more of that lobster flavor I would add half the amount of cream to the flour and compensate by using more lobster stock. We enjoyed this very much.",

My daughter came home one day and said she had to make lobster bisque for her food truck project at school...I about died and said, hey, we will go to the store and buy the pre-made bisque...nope, they were sold out. So I searched and found this one. Had the ingredients except for the lobster stock and lobster...lol... That's ok, I have a recipe for poorboy lobster (using cod). \nI put the recipe together a little differently, frying the veggies in the butter and seasoning before making the roux, then the stock, then the cream, etc... I don't think it matters I just thought the liquid before the cream was a good idea.\nThe seasoning measurements are spot on. I tripled the recipe and freeze extra. \nIn the past I used veggie stock for lobster stock (kind of salty...you have to adjust the other seasonings if you do it this way) but this time I used clam juice and cooked it down a little for the stock and stuck with the cod...I like it better than lobster and more cost efficient in my area of the country",

After preparing the meat put the shells back in the stock and simmer a while for a more favorful stock then drain via a colander to remove the shells. Two lobsers of a pound more more is all the meat you need. I also add a tab of butter and use cream instead of half and half but both work well I toss in the top greens from my celery to also add flavor and remove them before serving. Do not leave the Tamale in the lobster shells when making the stock or the stock will have a green hue. (harmless)",
