First I used a store bought espresso I found in the coffee section of my supermarket.  Then because I love macadamia nuts, I chopped them and spread them over the caramel layer.  I also use two different ice cream flavors- chocolate and coffe, and I spread more of the espresso sauce in between those layers.  Finally I top it off with more of the chopped macadamia nuts and serve it with whipped cream.  Make sure you cut the slices thin because this is rich- but absolutely heavenly!!",

Second the last review is a few years old and there is no photo of this recipe yet. I pretty much followed the recipe as written. For the chocolate cookies I used Oreos which I chopped finely in my blender. The caramel sauce turned out nice and creamy. For the fudge I realized I was out of Karo syrup as I was making it so I made a homemade verision. The espresso fudge is amazing don't substitute or leave out the espresso! For the vanilla ice cream I made homemade vanilla ice cream using a David Lebovitz recipe. On top of the last fugde layer on top of the ice cream I added Godiva 85% chocolate shavings then I piped on homemade whipped cream and added cherries. Turned out fantastic!",

I melted my spatula into the caramel sauce and had to re-do that part. I forgot how hot the stuff was so when I put water in the pan I had to throw out it splattered all over and burned my toes! I know that mistake was purely do to my haste. The part Im still not sure of is the last layer of fudge sauce over the ice cream. It solidified before I could spread it over the whole pie. Also when I went to cut the pie the top layer of fudge stuck to my knife instead of the pie. Maybe I didnt freeze the ice cream long enough and cool the fudge off enough. I hope that helps the next cook. I still recommend the recipe cuz no matter what it looked like served up I was sooooooo tasty!",

This is a time consuming recipe because you have to continue freezing the dessert between layers so allow plenty of time.

Also my springform pan did not fit into my freezer (I have a split fridge/freezer) so I had to rotate the dessert during the freezing process to ensure that the liquid did not roll to one side and freeze.",
