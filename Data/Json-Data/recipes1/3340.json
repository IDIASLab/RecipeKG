I used a smooth merlot that added depth but the overall recipe was less flavorful than I had hoped! I made the following changes / tweaks: added an entire chopped small yellow onion used 3 cloves of garlic added a 1/2 pound of sliced mushrooms used approx. 6 oz. of dumpling style egg noodles and increased the tomato juice and red wine by 1 cup each. If I make this in the future (which I probably won't) I will increase only the tomato juice and broth by 1 cup each and decrease the wine by 1 cup. Some additional spices should be added for flavor but I am not sure which ones. Thyme and parsley?",

Added a can of diced tomatoes in sauce. Used about 1 tsp sea salt. 1/4 tsp pepper. 1/4 tsp thyme. 1 Tbsp beef granules. Added some green beans from the garden half way through the day. Simmered all day in my crock pot. Omitted dumplings and instead cubed 2 yellow sweet potatoes and added them 2 hours before dinner. Delish! My husband ate 3 bowls!!!

I skip the dumplings (they just don't really go with this soup). Instead, I make barley separately and add it to our bowls when I serve because otherwise the barley soaks up all the amazing broth!\n\nHands down, this is one of the best soup recipes on this site!

I used a cabernet, leftover roast & homemade stock and added a little beef base to compensate for the condensed flavor of the canned broth.  There wasn't quite enough roast so I also added some lentils with the veggies (with extra water to cook them). I didn't make the dumplings because we don't care for them.
