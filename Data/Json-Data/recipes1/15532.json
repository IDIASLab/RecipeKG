I prepared the boxed cake per the directions, but instead of 1/2 cup oil, i did 1 tablespoon and added 1/2 cup applesauce (SO MOIST!).  I also added about a 1/2 cup strong coffee to my cake mix batter to enhance the chocolate flavor, or kahlua would be good i bet as well. Then when the cupcakes were finished, i made my own whipped cream and sprinkled tiny semi-sweet choc chips on top along with the cherry pie filling.  Seriously, BETTER than bakery cupcakes!  To die for when they are COLD and have settled in the fridge over night.  Watch people's faces when they try these! I am also going to try a spice cake mix with the cream cheese filling and apple pie filling drizzled with caramel sauce!  YUMMM!",

I followed most of the recipe but instead of using the the cool whip for icing I used premade cream cheese icing which i found stored nicely overnight. I also used an ice cream scoop to put the cake filling into the cupcake holders - worked like a charm. I filled it 3/4 of the way so the filling wasn't to far on the bottom to make it soft and wasn't to close to the top to make it pop off when you are trying to unwrap it to eat.  Thanks for the recipe, it sure has became one of my favorites",

I think you have to just be smart about your batter to cream cheese to cherry ratio in the cupcake so it doesn't overflow... I didn't have any overflow and mine ended up making about 30 cupcakes.  I used a large cookie scoop to transfer the cake batter and it worked really well without making a giant mess. Also I made a cool whip/cream cheese mixture and used it for both the inside and for on top. I agree with the reviewer that said you probably need 2 cans of pie filling because I basically ran out towards the end... Oh & I used the low-fat cake recipes & reduced fat cream cheese & cool whip- you would never know!! Will definitely make again!!",

I found that the cream cheese flavor was too complicated and distracted from the usual cherry/chocolate/whip cream joy of a traditional blackforest cake. Also my cream cheese/cherry filling sank to the bottom of my cupcakes and became a sloppy mess at the bottom. I also didn't like the frosting...it was dense and had an overpowering cream cheese flavor.
