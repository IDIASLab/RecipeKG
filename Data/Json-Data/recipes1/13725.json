Bananas vary, so if yours aren't very sweet, add more sugar.  If yours are especially moist, add a bit of extra flour (the finished dough should be like a thick muffin batter).  This recipe is forgiving enough to work even without these alterations, but a sense of adventure really helps take it up a notch.",

Since I didn't have sour cream, I made this recipe. This is good, but more cake-like...not nearly as rich or dense as my old favorite banana bread which I will continue to make. The sour cream must be what makes the difference!",

I also used 4 bananas, not 3 like others suggested.  I put the batter in a muffin metal pan (6 LARGE muffins).  In a large bowl I mixed brown sugar, cinnamon,  flour, health chips, and melted butter  and sprinkled it on top of the unbaked muffins.  I cooked it at 350 for 33 minutes.
