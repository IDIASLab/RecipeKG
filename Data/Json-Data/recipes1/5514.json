I used a half sweet onion and it took a full hour to broil on high the garlic 45 minutes. When to chop the mushroom was vague. I chopped before broiling and it broiled rapidly 10-12 minutes was plenty. Once all was blended I added a bit of mayo for smoothness of texture a bit of lemon juice and a dash of worcestershire. I dislike fennel so I left that out. This sauce looked gorgeous and extra kept well for use with other things. Prepare for rave reviews!",

Although next time I think I will divide the dressing recipe after preparing it & add a bit more olive oil & maybe some vinegar to one half. The \"dressing\" is perfect as is for pasta but I think it would coat the lettuce leaves better if it weren't so thick. We used leftover grilled lobster didn't shred it (it was cut in half lengthwise for visual appeal) garnished it w/ huge slivers of parmesan cheese (they added a lot!) & served it on the patio w/ a glass of pinot grigio. Great recipe...thansk! Forgot to add that you don't want to chop the mushroom before you roast...I did according to the directions & they were pretty rubbery. Next time I will roast then chop.",
