I make several other biscotti recipes and noticed this year that this recipe calls for double the amount of baking powder.  So I made my last batch of these cookies with half the baking powder.  VOILA!!  Perfect cookies!!  Give it a try.  Great recipe.  By the way, I've made this recipe with all sorts of different types of chocolate and nuts - all great.",

Personally, I thought it was a bit too sweet with all the chocolate chunks, so I would reduce them slightly next time. I also tried replacing some chunks with Whole unblanched almonds and it made for a very pretty cookie with the contrasting light nuts and white chocolate in the dark cookie dough. I'll make this again and again!  Definately wait the hour (even a half hour) to cut these before the second bake.  Cutting them while hot will guarantee a crumbly mess. AND you must use a very good, very sharp knife.  It makes a huge difference.",

I kept reading reviews about it being difficult to cut them for the second baking.  They are a little fragile, but with the right knife, they are not hard to do at all.  The first time I made them was kind of trial by error, but they are not hard just a little time consuming.  Like making bread.  I found that shaping the batter was easy to do if you wrap it in waxed paper, then you can push and flatten without a mess.  I used a ruler to make sure I had the proper size for baking, so that on the second baking they would be crisp and dry as they should be.  All in all, my family and friends loved them.  You need a little extra time to make them, but they are worth it.",

I did a search for chocolate biscotti in allrecipes and this one appealed to me the most.  I didn't have white chocolate squares and used about 1/3 cup white chips instead.  They are a really nice contrast against the dark biscotti.  I baked mine at 350 instead of 375 for twenty minutes.  I also sliced mine after only cooling for 15 minutes (I might only wait 10 minutes next time as the longer you wait the more crumbly they are).  I then baked the slices at 325 for only 5 minutes per side.  They are perfect.  Great for dunking in tea.  My kids aren't fans of biscotti as biscotti really needs dunking but I let them have the ends of the logs after the first baking.  They liked them like that (they said they tasted like brownies).  My dad says he enjoys these more than my mom's.  Sorry mom - I still want some of yours next Christmas!",

Speaking of coffee houses if you want your biscotti as crispy as it is at coffee houses definitely go for the 25 minutes. I pulled em out right at 20 when the toothpick first came out clean and then had to add extra time in the second bake. They still aren't quite as crispy as coffee house biscotti but they're still absolutely delicious. Who would have ever guessed that biscotti could be so easy to make at home?",

As for texture, sometimes you need to ignore the recipe and go with what feels right.  I had to adjust the flour to get the consistency right.  If you've never made biscotti before, to form it into a log it should be firm but not crumbly.  Yet, it definietly  shouldn't stick to your fingers.  I preferred to dip this biscotti in chocolate (did both dark and white) to give it an extra sweetness.  Tip: Use a ruler to help shape the biscotti: use the flat side of a normal 12 inch ruler and \"scrape\" the biscotti into shape on a flat (preferably cold) countertop. This way you can tell just how thick and how flat the biscotti is; if that made any sense.",
