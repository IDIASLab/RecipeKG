First there is no seasoning other than salt and pepper! But that was easily fixed with a sort of all seasoning blend called \"Old World 3rd Street Seasoning\" from the Spice House in Milwaukee (ingredients of which are unfortunately not included on the jar). I used it on the peppers and onions as well as the chops and also added fresh minced garlic. These two small additions alone I know made all the difference in this dish and definitely should be included. The flour was unnecessary so I didn't use it; I did use the browning sauce and wish I would have omitted that too. All it did was obliterate the beautiful colors of the green orange red and yellow peppers I used. Finally the cooking time is far too long particularly for boneless chops. To simmer these for 40 minutes would make them tough as a board! Boneless chops are so lean that they only need to simmer till cooked through - I think mine took 10 minutes. Still the final result was very good and had that final result been the actual recipe I'd have rated it four stars!",
