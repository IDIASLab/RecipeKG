For true mint lovers the mint between the layers just isn't enough; for that extra oomph get crumbled Andes mints in your baking section of the grocery store and add approx 1/4 c right into the cake batter while mixing. They melt into the cake when baking and come out great! I also sprinkled some on top of cake after icing. Use a different thicker fudge frosting - this one is too thin. Also don't cook for the full time listed - I cooked for about 20 mins and stick with the old toothpick test and you'll be ok. Also found I needed to make two batches for the cake to be thick and moist as we like.",

I made it for my husband's birthday, and, although he says he hates mayonnaise and can taste it in anything, he hadn't a clue there was mayo in the mix!  The second time I made the cake, I substiuted chcolate caramel bars for the chocolate mint patties, since I am not a huge fan of mint.  It was even better with a layer of peanuts on top of that to make a chocolate Snickers cake!  I will definitely be passing this recipe along to all of my friends and family!",

The first time I made this I happened to have a jar of Betty Crocker frosting in the cupboard and being a lazy person I used that instead of making the frosting from the recipe. The result was absolutely superb and I've used the store bought frosting ever since. One great thing about this recipe is that the mint stops the cake from becoming too overpowered by the chocolate content.",

The mint layer did taste good and was just the right amount of mint taste not too strong. However if I made this recipe again I would use a different frosting recipe. After completing the frosting as directed it was more like a glaze and way too runny to actually use to frost the cake. It took over an hour for the frosting to cool and thicken enough to put on the cake and that hour included time spent cooling in the refrigerator. Also the cake layers took less than 25 minutes to cook. I checked them after 21 minutes and they were done. If I had left them in the full 25 minutes they would have been overcooked. Otherwise this was an easy to make cake recipe with acceptable results.",
