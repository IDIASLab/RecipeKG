First, I forgot to toast the sesame seeds, and that would have helped greatly with the flavor. It would have been helpful to include how to toast the seeds. Second, I didnt read the notes until after the mixture was cooling, and the information would have been helpful in the directions. My papers stuck on one side because I didn't put anything on them. Otherwise, I like trying new things, and these were tasty.",
