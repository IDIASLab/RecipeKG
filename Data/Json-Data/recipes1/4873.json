Make the potatoes exactly like you would to make your regular perogies (add the cheese directly to the potatoes and whatever seasonings).  My family is Ukranian and we serve perogies with fried bacon and onions, so that is what I put on the top.  When you cut into this to serve, what you are going to taste ultimately is the potatoes, so if you're expecting it to taste like perogies, you have to make the potatoes like you would if you were doing it the old fashioned way.  This is a good way to get that taste without all the work!",

While I learned to make this using the lasagna noodles I have altered it over the years to save time on cooking the noodles. In a pinch I use elbow macaroni - one layer of elbows mashed potatoes cheese another layer of elbows and then covered with the sauteed onions. This is the only butter in my recipe. I don't put pats of butter over the potatoes. This is also a great way to make a single serving as well. I always use American Cheese but have added cheddar on occasion. My one last variation on this recipe - when I make it as for a covered dish affair I use large pasta shells and stuff them individually - a small ice cream scoop of potatoes 1/2 slice of American cheese are perfect. Then I lay them all out in a pan and pour the sauteed onions over. This makes serving a whole lot easier since there is no cutting involved. Just pick up the entire shell. Salt and pepper to taste and you're good to go.",

You can simply layer any cooked pasta and mashed potatoes in the same manner as this recipe and get awesome results. By following this recipe as listed I recommend cooking at least 4 pieces less of a pound of lasagna...otherwise there's too much pasta. Additionally I never think that I have enough cheese with just one pound. This is always just soooo good and a total pleaser.",

I made my own mash; since I was low on potatoes I used a medium-sized bag of frozen vegetables to make up the difference. I used whipping (heavy) cream margarine salt pepper and dried chives in my mashed potatoes. I would also use garlic powder next time. I added the cheese into the mixture; we used a marble cheddar.I chose to use whole wheat lasagna noodles (a full box is too much; only use about half depending on the size of your pan). I sprayed my baking dish with PAM instead of greasing with butter. We topped the casserole with fried onions and used a full pack of bacon (okay maybe that's a bit too much but it gave lots of flavour). The end result was a little greasy (our fault I'm sure) and tasted very similar to traditional pierogies. This is great when feeding a larger number of people without all the fuss of the individual dumplings. We would make this again.",
