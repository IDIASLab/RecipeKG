The only thing I would like to comment is that you need to wait 10 minutes before you swirl the choc chips.

This resulted in a less \"bubbly\" or \"squishy\" bar. Unlike other reviewers I thought 3 minutes was plenty of time for the chocolate chips to melt. My advice is to check on them at 3 minutes. Poke a chip with a butter knife. If it's soft it should marbleize just fine. If not give it a little more time - not too much or the bars will set. Also I decided to sprinkle a 1/2 cup pecans over the bars after 10 minutes of baking because I like pecans in chocolate chip cookies. Finally I lightly covered the pan with foil during the last three minutes of cook time because I noticed that the surface of the bars was cooking faster than the center. The bars turned out great. As you can see in the picture I posted they look pretty too.:)",
