You can use a can and a half of mixed nuts (about 1 lb) if you're feeling poor. Dust most of the salt off by rolling them on a terry towel. Use 2/3 c brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. cloves, egg white of a small egg, 4-5 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. ginger, 2 tsp vanilla. Otherwise, follow recipe.  Bake 24 mins. Cool and dust with confectioner's sugar.\" \r\n\r\nWe did them that way and they were very good -- the confectioner's sugar gave them a different look and they worked very well for a holiday snack.  The salt in the nuts helped to cut the sweetness.",
