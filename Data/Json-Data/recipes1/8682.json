It pairs REALLY well with dark tea. I did notice that it was done at 7 minutes, though I left it until 8. At 8 minutes when it cools down it resembles more of a ginger snap consistency (I didn't add nuts, none on hand!), but it makes a really good thing to dip into your tea! Also, if you don't have cinnamon, you can mix up whatever you want to add. I used 2 tsp cake spice, but I'm willing to bet pumpkin spice or any combination of allspice, nutmeg, etc., would make wonderful additions/substitutions. Enjoy!!! (ps - 1 tsp baking soda and 2 tsp cream of tartar is really just 3 tsp baking powder!)",

I used all whole-wheat flour and subbed 1-1/2 tsp baking powder for the baking soda and cream of tartar (thanks to hereforfood for the tip). My kids do not like nuts so left those out. Also I didn't have time to refrigerate so instead of rolling into log and chilling I scooped out dough with tablespoon measuring spoon rolled into a ball then flattened. Good cookie!",
