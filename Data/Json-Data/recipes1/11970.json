I did not have a good grasp of the fundamentals of baking and was just playing around. I definitely agree now that the amount of butter/shortening is WAY too much and the white chocolate chips should probably be cut in half or at least reduced somewhat. I'm now 25 and would make many changes to this recipe before trying it again. I just wanted to warn those reading it that this recipe was made up by a child and not a expert baker and you might want to make significant changes before trying it. I'm glad some people liked it as is. I still very much like the basic idea of the cookie having white chips macadamia nuts and coconut but you will probably want to play with the amounts of butter and shortening or add more flour and another egg or something to make it better.",
