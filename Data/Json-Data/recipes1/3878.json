Salt and pepper to taste.  You can replace the bacon with diced pepperoni and a bit of butter if you like.  I was a foreign exchange student in Austria for a year, and my host mom always made this if she was in a hurry- she called it fast food.  Tastes great!",

I'm always looking for recipes that he would like b/c he's so picky. I used the Multi Grain Penne instead of Spaghetti b/c that is what he likes. I also added some pureed veggies in it with the cheese and egg mixture (of course he doesn't KNOW that!) Be sure and add a lil milk to the mixture too. I did not use the onions (for obvious reasons) but did use some onion powder. I also added some mixed Italian style shredded cheese. I sprinkled some more bacon bits (from the package) on the top with more of the Italian style cheese. Also to the reviewer that stated something about \"raw\" eggs...the eggs cook faster than the cheese even melts so no worries there. Anyway HE LOVED it and we will be making this again. Thank you!",

I added 1-2 Tablespoons of milk to the mixture in order to help with the cheese melting and to make it a little creamier. I also added around 1 tsp of fresh ground pepper to the eggs when I scrambled them. I will add a dash or two of cayenne pepper to the eggs next time around to give them some body. I added tabasco to my portion at the table but it is a little strong for my hubby. I also followed the recipe for the velveeta but added about a 1/3 cup sharp cheddar cheese as well.",
