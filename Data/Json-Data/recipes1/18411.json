Since that first encounter with this dish 25 years ago I never had it again - imagine that 25 years. I was so grateful to stumble upon a simple and easy recipe to create this awesome side dish. I've always loved broccoli cheese and rice separately so why not combine them altogether and create a sensation dish. The only change that I have made to the recipe originally posted was instead of using cheese dip; namely Cheese Whiz I use the Tostadas brand of cheese dip - in particular the jalape\u00f1o cheddar. It's great and it adds a little and subtle kick to the dish.",
