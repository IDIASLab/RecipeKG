I cooked the pineapple and bacon separately and then just layered it onto top of cooked hamburger. Next time I will stick a slice of cheddar in there. The pineapple gives it a tangy taste. I think this may be even better on ground pork. Thank you!  ***UPDATE- can be made the same way and tastes just as good with a boca burger and the soy bacon from Morningstar Farms.",

I didn't have rings of pineapple so I used tidbits placing them on a piece of foil. Treat the burgers very gently. I added a bit of plain breadcrumbs to the seasoned meat to help everything bind and flipped them very carefully. They were deliclious and went well with the Tropical Salad with Pineapple Vinigarette recipe from this site. Flavors matched beautifully. Also served with a great Napa Zinfindel. What a great meal.",

I used 1 pound of ground beef (for two people) 1 cup BBQ sauce and I diced up some of the pineapple and added it to the meat mixture to enhance the Polynesian flavor. Next time I ll add pineapple tidbits instead. To prevent the burgers from falling apart I added about a 1 cup of plain breadcrumbs and an egg to bind. I grilled the pineapple slices separately from the burgers. For crispy bacon I put the bacon slices onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper covered with more parchment and then another cookie sheet and baked in the oven at 400 for about 25 minutes. Assembled everything together on a toasted bun and topped with more BBQ sauce Perfection!",
