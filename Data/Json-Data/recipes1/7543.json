You may need to make a trip to an Indian grocery store to stock up on spherical 'puris' (also called as pani-puri puris), 'sev', green chutney, and a sweet and sour chutney. I have tried here to give as many substitutions as possible, if you are unable to go to an Indian grocery store. However, you will definitely lose the authentic taste if you make substitutions. If you can find them, use black salt in place of the rock salt, spherical puris in place of the wheat crackers, and plain sev in place of the crushed potato chips.",

I increased the ginger freshly grated to 2-3 tsp. I buy the authentic chips from the Indian store and only mix up some of the Chaat with the chips as wanted - dont mix it all at once as it does have to be eaten right away to maintain the soft and crunchy textures. Use fresh Cilantro not dried. I didnt mash the potato but left it in small chunks adds to the interesting texture differences! Yum Yum!",

And if you're worried about having to much of it just to try this recipe, you can sprinkle that stuff on roast potatoes, mix it into rice, add it to fruit salad - but I don't know if it qualifies as chaat without chaat masala.",
