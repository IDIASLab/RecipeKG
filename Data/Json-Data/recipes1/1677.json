Once I started adding the liquid mix the stirring was much easier than with most frostings. I added about a tablespoon of corn syrup I find it helps cut the 'powdered sugar' taste. Easy to color easy to use didn't form a crust too fast which is nice (I was sprinkling sugar etc).",

It is possible that you could add more butter (maybe 3T more) and decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup depending on how sweet you want it by using 2 cups of sugar then tasting it then adding a little more until you get to the right sweetness and thickness. It may not happen but I hope it does.",
