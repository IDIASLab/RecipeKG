My personal favorite it ham - the thicker imported ham slices. I add a tad bit of horseradish to the cream cheese too. A recommendation so it isn't so messy. Dry off the ham slices first and spead the cheese on the ham, not the pickles. Very easy and YUMMY!!!",

Instead of putting the pickle in whole, she chops up the pickles and mixes them with cream cheese, a little pickle juice and a dash of salt creating a dip. She sometimes spreads it across bolonga, but she usually serves it as a dip with chips, pretzels, etc. It's been a staple in our family for years!!",
