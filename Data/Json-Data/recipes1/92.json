I followed the recipe exactly (including the optional ingredients) - except I doubled it and used a 9 by 13 pan (did not need to adjust baking time at all). To the reviewer who said their crust was crumbly the only thing I can think of was that they didn't work the butter in enough with a pastry blender. My crust was perfect. As another reviewer suggested I refrigerated it first before cutting. I also stored it in the fridge to keep the squares firm. The only negative thing I could possibly say about this recipe is that it's so addictive it's almost impossible not to overindulge.",
