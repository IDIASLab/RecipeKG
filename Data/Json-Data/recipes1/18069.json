About this recipe...Any cola will not work for this drink.  You must use Coca Cola or you\u2019re not making Kalimotxo properly.  Coca Cola is very important because the other brands of colas are too sweet and that destroys the mix.\nThe other thing this recipe and its direction leave out is that it has to be bad wine, this is fundamental, because kalimotxo with good wine tastes worse and you are just wasting a good wine.  The wine should be bitter, because Coca Cola is sweet enough and the mix has to be compensated for.\nThe other thing is the mixing of this drink, you want to maintain as much of the gases from the coke as possible, so be careful with doing the mixing.  I recommend you us an empty 2 liter bottle, carefully fill about half the bottle with the coke, then add the bad red wine, then carefully fill with the rest of the coke.  Close the bottle and gently rock it about 4 or 5 times to mix, remember, your attempting to maintain as much of the gasses of the coke as possible.  Oh yes, the other thing about Kalimotxo is try not to drink too much of it, it will leave you with one nasty hangover the next day after drinking all that sugar.",
