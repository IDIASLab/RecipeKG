But I remedied this by adding a half cup of ketchup a quarter cup of white sugar and another small can of tomato paste. That fixed it. I also have to note that once canned in my pressure canner this recipe takes on a rich fuller taste and the texture is also improved. This stuff turned out to be so good that I immediately made another batch. I will be proud to give some away as Christmas gifts but not too much as I want most of it for myself. Thanks for sharing!",
