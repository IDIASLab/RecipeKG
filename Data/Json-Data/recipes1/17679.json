This corn is soo good. You do not taste the mayonnaise like it is. It melts together with the cheese, butter and chili powder and creates this totally different flavor. We also make this with frozen or canned corn when fresh corn is not available. Just adjust the amounts of ingredients to taste.  Don't forget to drain the corn completely first.  Happy Eating!",

First I bring the butter to room temperature until it is softened. I then combine together the mayo butter and parmesan cheese. Then I mince cilantro and add that in along with some sea salt. Once the corn comes off the grill I roll each ear in this mixture. The cilantro really gives this corn the punch you are looking for.",

Other reviewers mentioned grilling at the end though so I did since I had it on anyway. We squirted lime juice on just before eating.",
