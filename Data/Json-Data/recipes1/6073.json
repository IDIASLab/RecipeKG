I love all the stuff in it and the dressing is a bit lower in fat;) My only complaint is that it takes me longer than 45 min of cook/prep time and I use drained sweet pickle relish instead of chopping the sweet pickles. It makes a large amount more than the recipe says it serves but can be cut in half for a family of four with leftovers the next day.",

I added a bit more mustard for taste and for ease of preparing i julienned the potato on a Pampered Chef slicer. The taters had a bit less texture to them but boiled a lot faster. All in all I was very pleased with this recipe but you will probably need to add salt at the table. Slim down on the celery if the majority of your family isn't celery lovers. This recipe actually feeds more than what it says - i have half a bowl left over. Also if you have the time and the room make this dish 2 days before to make sure all the flavors blends. I made this 24 hours ahead of time but it was even better Monday!",

I still like mom's potato salad made with onions and cucumbers but hubby is from the South and he grew up on this sort of relish/ mustard type of potato salad. He loved it. Much better than the store bought versions. Sweet (and dill) pickle salad cubes are sold in the South commonly alongside of the relish and used in salads often. Don't overdo the pickle cubes I thought the proportion in the recipe was a bit much. You can leave out the sugar too sweet enough without it.",

Instead of relish I used bread-n-butter pickes that I chopped and also used the same pickle juice. I also substituted a red bell pepper instead of the green pepper. After much doctoring and adding more sugar and mustard the end result was a wonderful creation!! Everyone loved it!! I now have a great recipe of my own thanks to using this one as a guide.",
