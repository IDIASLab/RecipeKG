Recipe is fail proof too apparently - I changed the milk to water as we have lactose issues in the house and I used 2 yolks left over from ones I needed to separate in another bread yesterday in place of the whole egg. They tasted just like the golden egg bread from the store - ONLY FRESH! Oh - and I did cut the sugar in half too just because i didnt want too sweet of a roll for dinner. SO 5 stars for a great recipe i could not mess up! Rolls were still fresh at breakfast too!...... Been making these for almost a year now and they remain our favorite diner rolls from this site. If you are considering them for your holiday meal then please try them! I have mine made baked and frozen already for Thanksgiving dinner - just defrost heat and serve - they are so good and very easy!",

I cooked them before I put the turkey in the oven in the morning and then I popped them back in the oven while I was letting my turkey rest. That way everyone had nice warm rolls. Excellent recipe! These are my personal notes: Dissolve the sugar into the warm water then add yeast. Let it sit for 10mins. Then add milk (replace the water with milk) oil and beaten egg. Then add listed amount of flour and salt. Add the remaining flour if required. Also when baking- be really careful of the baking time",

                "reviewBody": "Using my Kitchen Aid to combine the ingredients, this took physically no more than 20 minutes. I followed this recipe closely, only using regular yeast (I did NOT have rapid rise), melted butter instead of shortening and AP flour instead of bread flour. I let the yeast sit with the warm milk/water and sugar for 10 minutes in the mixer bowl, then added the egg, butter and the dry ingredients. This only needed a couple more tablespoons of flour to get it to form a solid ball so I could knead it with the dough hook. This rose beautifully both times. The first time I let it rise, it took an hour to double on the warm heating pad in a greased, covered bowl--the second time I let it rise, I used my dry 1/4 measuring cup to form uniform rolls, rolled them into a nice ball and set them in a greased muffin tin and covered it with saran wrap and set it to rise on the warm heating pad for a half hour. I got 11 good sized rolls out of one recipe--not 24. 400* for 12 minutes and they were ready to go. The butter brushed over the top was just WONDERFUL. Lightly sweet, very nice yeast dinner roll. VERY easy. I'll make this recipe again. NOTE: BE SURE you double this recipe if you want more than 11-12 rolls. This does not make the full 24 that it states. If you're making this for a large gathering/group, you'll want to adjust the servings.",
