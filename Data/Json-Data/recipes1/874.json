When he was asked by my sister if he had a favorite dessert he would like for Thanksgiving he said he would like a Pecan Pie but he was sure she wouldn't know how to make it. Well determined to make my Dad's favorite I got on \"the Net\" to find a recipe and found Mike's. His sister came in for Thanksgiving too (another Southerner). They both commented that this was by far the best pecan pie they ever tasted. I had to admit it was the best I ever had too because I never had or even baked one before. I had always heard how rich they were. We heated up the pieces and put French Vanilla ice cream on them...Thank you Mike!!!...BTW...I ended up making 2 of them for Christmas last year and there wasn't a single piece of crust left of them by the end of the evening.",

This recipe was given to me about 8 years ago by a customer who thought this recipe would be great for me to use instead of the one I was given in culinary school. After a few minor tweaks here and there and my own homemade crust this is the best selling pie I've ever made. It's also a family favorite and has converted my dad who didn't eat pecan pie because it was always too sweet a HUGE fan of it. I don't know what kind of dark corn syrup the user who thought it was too bitter tried but this pie is an enormous hit with my family friends and my clients. If I don't have dark corn syrup I substitute with 3/4 c. light corn syrup and top the cup off with molasses(spray the glass measuring cup with cooking spray to make everything come out easier). I've also only chopped half the pecans add them to the crust(not the custard) pour the custard in and top the pie with the whole nuts(randomly not necessarily in a pattern). The pie cuts easier with chopped nuts but the whole nuts on top make a prettier presentation.",

Then when the pie was almost ready I brushed a lil' bit of beated egg white over the pecans to give it a shiny look. Simply marvelous!:)",
