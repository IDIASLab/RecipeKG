I have to agree that this is by far the best recipe for waldorf salad. I think what makes it so good is the heavy cream and the nutmeg. When I made it I used red delicious apples (because they are my motherinlaw's favorite apple) but I think it would be good with a less sweet apple like a jonathan or macintosh too. I used red seedless grapes. My motherinlaw who is 93 said it tastes like the waldorf salad that she made. At her age I think she knows what traditional waldorf salad should be like and this is it! Use fresh lemons because that keeps your apples from browning as well as giving a little zip. I always prefer fresh lemon juice over concentrate. Thank you June sharing the perfect Waldorf salad recipe. My search is FINALLY over!:-)",
