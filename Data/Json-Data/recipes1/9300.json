Instead of using boneless chicken breast which tend to dry out easily I use a whole chicken cut into pieces I cut the vinegar with about 1/4 cup to 1/3 cup water add about 1tbs of crushed red pepper flakes and put in a slow cooker to cook all day while I am at work. All that's left to do when you get home is make some rice and whatever veggies you might like. Talk about something good.",

As I was making it I realized that the housemate really dislikes vinegar so I cut the tang with a drizzle of honey on each breast. Despite being overly generous with the ingredients the hubby loved it; the vinegar hating housemate will eat it if I make it again which is actually high praise for something made with vinegar. I'd pay closer attention to amounts next time; definitely step back on the garlic which I had doubled for 7 half breasts. It did create a lovely tender chicken and the honey did take some of the sharpness out if you have someone in your house not overly fond of vinegar.",

I used legs and thighs so I cooked it about 45-50 minutes and it was still very moist. I also like the low calorie count but I agree the meal is a bit bland and lacking in color if you don't beef up the side dishes. We had sauteed spinach and portobello mushrooms cranberry sauce and steamed white rice (I also drizzled some of the juice from the chicken on my rice). My three kiddies and hubby liked too so I'll be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.",
