Moist, colorful and just extraordinary for a patriotic holiday.  If there is any down-side, it is the amount of time to prepare since you must not only make the 4 cake layers but also cut and mold and frost in-between various shapes and decorate the top... but it was ALL worth it.  Serve it and they will never want anything else again, guaranteed.  I used another recipe from this site, Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting, and it was perfect for binding everything in place, not overpowering the cake and also providing a cool touch for those summer-time barbeques.  Just be sure you have the CLEAR vanilla extract- the other will turn the cake yellow and ruin the presentation.  Did I mention I LOVE this?",

The icing picked up red crumbs when I tried to spread it and the whole thing looked like a muddled mess. Next, when trying to add subsequent layers, they broke and cracked and fell to pieces.\nThe blue layer just sort of sagged around the edges and as a result, ended up breaking and sliding off down the various sides of the cake.\nNext time, I'll buy a cake and spend my money on alcohol.",

There are NO 10.25 ounce packages of cake mix in the supermarket so I measured out 3 x 10.25 ounces of cake mix. Had I reviewed the back of the packages I would have realized that the 10.25 ounce notation was incorrect. It should read 16.25 ounce. The liquid measurements agreed with the use of the 3 16.25 ounce cake mixes. As a result lots of crumbling falling and mess. The finished cake looked awful as a whole but cut into beautiful layers.

I went with other suggestions and left the cake plain white on the outside with simple piping and some white sugar glitter with a few white chocolate chips sprinkled on top and two small American flags that I crossed and had standing in the cake. So when it is sliced... Wow!  My tips for baking. I didn't have clear vanilla so I left it out until I divided and colored the batter and used my regular vanilla in the colored batter and I used almond extract in the white portion. Also I freeze the white chocolate chips then toss them in flour before adding them in the blue batter.  You will see the stars.  Lastly after i bake the layers and they are still hot. Using a pot holder to protect my hand, I press the cake firmly into the pans. This evens out the layers and makes them more dense which makes them easier to slice after they have cooled. They will still be very moist. I used a cream cheese frosting for the middle and I used a whipped cooked buttercream frosting for the outside. Definitely use parchment paper for baking and put your layers cut side down to make frosting easier.  The flavor was great and it's a very delicious cake! I have already received requests for next year.  Loved it!",

Make sure you cool the cakes until they are stone cold before attempting to cut them in pieces. If they are at all warm the cakes will crumble and break.

                "reviewBody": "This cake is absolutely stunning.  It takes a lot of time and requires patience, but well worth the effort.   I used white chocolate frosting between the layers and butter cream frosting for the sides and top. My rating is for the creative idea, NOT the cake recipe.  The cake part of the recipe will leave you scratching your head and a notepad full of scribbles trying to figure out how to adjust.  First, I could not find a 10.25 oz cake mix which left me wondering if there was a error when this got published.  So, I watched the video and it couldn\u2019t be more vague.  It skips over the recipe only saying to use 3 boxes of cake mix and follow the directions on the back of the box.  Easy enough, but that\u2019s not the written recipe because the written version clearly modifies the box instructions.  My advice is to use your favorite white cake recipe or mix and make 2-8\" red cakes, 1 blue, and 1 white and use this recipe for the assembly instructions.",

                "reviewBody": "This is NOT an easy cake but WOW the end result was AMAZING. A few words of advice: I skipped the white chocolate chips after watching the video they didn't have the desired effect for me. Clear vanilla extract is hard to find so I substituted a little almond extract and a little orange extract...clear extracts that I had on hand. The cake was still fantastic and I actually enjoyed the little orange touch. I was so surprised at how much food coloring I needed...much more than the recipe called for. I was lucky and had some on hand but make sure you buy more than you think you'd have to. I found that when cutting the cake it was best to use some sort of guide to balance the knife on. It was far too easy to go off course. Store bought frosting was overly sweet and hard to spread when I made the cake the first time so I decided to make whipped cream and frost the cake with that instead. Not only was it delicious and not too sweet it was also easy to spread and sturdy. I found it more dramatic not to do anything with the outside of the cake. It makes it more exciting when you cut into it! Finally when you're done with the cake store it somewhere safe using toothpicks as needed...the cake is prone to cracking and crumbling and parts of it can even crumble off!",

                "reviewBody": "Bought three 16 ounce boxes of Duncan Hines moist white cake mix. The \"six\" on the package looks like a zero, and I could not find a 10.5 ounce box. Anyway, I used one box for the white layers, half a box for the blue layer and one and a half boxes for the red layers. I expected to trim quite a bit to achieve even layers. It was more of a challenge than I thought it would be. Used regular liquid food color. Went to the store to buy more, because you need A LOT to get just the right colors. The batter was several un-Godly colors, until I reached the shades of red and blue that I wanted. Reynolds parchment paper kept the cakes from sticking. I would make this cake again, and I love the idea of serving it with lighted sparklers. What a fun and festive holiday dessert!",
