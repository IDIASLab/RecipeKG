The recipe makes a lot of the cream cheese layer you could easily cut it in half if you want less sugar. Overall if you like chess squares this recipe is great. If you think it's too much sugar you're obviously not from the South.",

My only complaint is that the recipe doesn't tell you that the cream cheese part rises up quite a bit. The person who said a 9 in round must have used 1/2 the cream cheese part because I too used a 9 inch round and half the cream cheese is sitting at the bottom of my oven in my smoke filled kitchen. Don't use a 9 inch round people.",
