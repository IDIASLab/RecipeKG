So we decided to add some white wine (to get the juices out of the tomatoes) and then it all took off! It was great! I decided to be adventurous with the cheeses and added a mix of primasalata (a harder version of a somewhat salty ricotta) mahon (a spanish cow's milk cheese) and some drunken goat cheese...well I bet it would be great with any kind of mix of random cheese you have somewhere in your fridge! Other changes: I added more mushrooms ('cause I had extra) cut the capers in half and rinsed the kalamata... and it still didn't need extra salt! My husband is Calabrian and he thinks it's own of the better pasta dishes he's ever had! Wierd but... there you have it!",
