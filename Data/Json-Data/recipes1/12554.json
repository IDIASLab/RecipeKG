I did saute the onions then I dropped in garlic paste in place of the garlic powder (I didn't have any powder) saute the garlic. I then added in the zucchini stirred that a bit. I then added the rest of the spices and cooked that for a bit then I added in the tomatoes cooked that for a bit then added the water then the yogurt cooked everything for about 5 minutes and then served with chopped cilantro. I will def. make this again and maybe even change the vegi. out for another one.",
