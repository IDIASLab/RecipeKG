While I'm not a huge turkey fan especially that of the processed lunchmeat variety I but was pleasantly surprised by the maple honey flavor. But this sandwich wasn't a favorite of mine. I guess I'm not much for savory turkey and sweet cranberry sauce together. For the cranberry sauce I whipped up Festive Holiday Cranberry Relish from this site (it is actually a sauce not a relish). The sandwich looks beautiful when put together but just didn't suit my palate.",
