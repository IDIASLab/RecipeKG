I actually took all the ingredients (just one lemon tho and more olive oil than recipe asks for) and blended them in a zipblock and let the porkchops marinate in the bag for a couple of hours. Then I cooked the dinner according to the recipe and added all the ingredients all over again to the meat in the pan (less one lemon). I minced the garlic rosemary and basil and it turned out like a pesto then rubbed it on top of meat. My husband raved about this meal as did I! It was sooo good. I think the marinating the pork made a huge difference!",

Then I let them sit for a about 5 mins covered.  Very easy and fast and tastes amazing!  I've made these before without marinating and they weren't as good.  I highly recommend marinating them - makes the flavors pop!  Served with long grain & wild rice w/ chopped red pepper and onion, and corn.",
