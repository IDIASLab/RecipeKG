Also by \"eggy\" if you have chunks of egg you are cooking too hot and not stirring constantly and not doing a sufficient job with the strainer. I have noticed that it is good to strain it twice. If you strain it when putting it in to its cooling pitcher etc. thats gets the base of it out. Then if you strain it again when it has been cooled that takes the clumps that have joined then. Then put it into the refrigerator and have happy holidays. If you are fed up with making this stuff just go buy it. Now I'll tell you not very many people carry Boiled Custard but the brands I have seen are Sealtest Southern Bell and Deans. Request it if you local grocer doesn't carry it. -Talbott KY",

I just use the yolks when it's cooking and then when it's finished I whip the whites with some sugar, and then fold the whites into the custard while it's cooling. Then you don't have to strain it and you get good little chunks of meringue-like pieces.",
