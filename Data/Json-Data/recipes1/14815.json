When i proof my yeast i use 1/2 cup of water and when it is time to add it to the flour and other ingredients i use 1 1/2 cups of warm milk (to replace the left out water) In the dough I add 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic 1-2 tbsp of parsley and 1-2 tbsp Italian seasoning. In the cheese filling I add 2-3 more minced garlic cloves! (we like a lot of garlic) and about 1/2 cup of parm cheese. I like to keep the pepperoni separate from the cheese mixture. I put a thick layer of it on one side of the rolled out dough then add the cheese mixture and close her up. They are delicious!

We even put the fillings into \"zones\" and tried to make a gross Halloween anatomy lesson out of it with the pepperoni zone being the intestines, the black olives being the \"spleens\" etc. Then it was extra giggle-y and gross when I could ask them which PART of the snake they wanted to eat!
