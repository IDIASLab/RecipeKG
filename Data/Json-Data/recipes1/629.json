It was a pretty easy recipe it could use maybe a little bit more chocolate in the cookie (i was on a major chocolate jones when i made these.) The recipe for the frosting makes MORE than enough. I cut the powdered sugar in half and added a little bit more milk. This cookie is soft and yummy. It's almost like a cake but still a cookie. I really liked how this recipe didn't use a lot of butter. I will most definetly make these cookies again.:)",
