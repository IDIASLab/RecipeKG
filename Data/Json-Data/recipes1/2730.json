I only use fresh sweet potatoes as I don't care for canned. Also, I don't like to boil potatoes (loses flavor) so what I do is wash about 4 sweet potatoes (leaving skins on), wrap them in aluminum foil and bake them in the oven at 450 degrees for about an hour or until soft. Let them cool, unwrap foil and then cut in half and the skins easily slip off. If you have the time, this is A LOT easier then peeling and cutting sweet potatoes to boil (don't know about you all, but sometimes trying to cut through a raw sweet potato is pretty difficult!!). Anyway, then I follow the recipe from there. Yum! I always get rave reviews. Thanks again for this great recipe!",

The topping was delicious and I got many compliments.  Thanks!",

I'm glad I read the recommendations to reduce the sugar, because it would have been much too sweet otherwise.  I made it with 8 cups of baked mashed yams instead of sweet potatoes, reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup, used 1 stick of butter, and added cinnamon & nutmeg to taste.  For the topping I reduced the brown sugar to 1 cup, and used 1 stick of butter.  I made the yams last night, and kept them in the fridge, then this morning I covered them with the topping, and baked.  All my co-workers asked for the recipe!",

There have been times where I used canned sweet potatoes instead of fresh to save time. When I do this I omit the sugar from the potatoe portion of the recipe (the syrup in the can makes it sweet enough) and I strain the potatoes out of their syrup. Nobody could tell I used canned sweet potatoes and it was loved by everyone. I cut the topping portion in half (I always had extra left when I made a full batch) and put everything in a round casarole dish and that seems to be a good amount for a family event.",
