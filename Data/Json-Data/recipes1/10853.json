I learned this recipe in my Home Ec class all the way back in middle school and I've cooked it ever since. Here are some important modifications I've learned that will solve some complaints about flavor problems.\n\n1. Cook the peas separately and set them aside.\n2. Cook the bacon in the pan, remove the bacon, and crumble. Leave the bacon grease in the pan.\n3. Add ONIONS! I don't measure, just use common sense and add a proportional amount, chopped. \n4. Fry the onions right in the bacon grease until they start to turn clear and slightly browned. Then add the (raw) chopped carrots and cook those for a few minutes. \n5. At this point, I shove everything to one side with a spatula and cook the eggs right in the pan on the empty side. Less pans to deal with later and it's easy/fast. Scramble them in a separate bowl first, then pour in the pan.\n6. Once the eggs are scrambled and chopped up, add the peas, bacon, and rice.\n7. I don't measure the soy sauce I use, but it\u2019s probably more than 2 tbs. I pour on until everything is well coated. This way you don't need to add salt - the soy sauce takes care of that.\n\nHopefully these suggestions help. It's not authentic fried rice but it tastes awesome. I used to use vegetable oil but the bacon grease is already there and it tastes great (if a bit unhealthy... ah well).",

I also added scallions and fresh minced garlic.  I think the addition of some chopped onion would be good as well.  The egg can be cooked at the same time the rice is cooking.  Simply push the rice to one side, drop in egg and scramble, then mix all ingredients together.   My husband commented several times at dinner how good the rice was.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I used just one bag of frozen broccoli stir fry veggies to avoid chopping, which had broccoli, onions, mushrooms, celery, red peppers and water chesnuts and cooked them in the mircowave. I used only 3 cups of cooked rice and when it came time to add the rice to the bacon grease, I added the veggies, soy sauce and bacon all at once. Right before serving, I added the scrambled eggs.  It DOES take up a lot of dishes to make this but everyone in my family loved it and I will make it again!",
