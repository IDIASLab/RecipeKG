I make it as a layer cake, using 2 eggs rather than 3 egg whites--this makes for a more moist cake, and there's no waste of yolks.  I cover the sides of the cake completely with additional crushed Oreos and stand more cookies, cut in half, upright along the top edge. I make the frosting a little differently, mostly to ensure an ample amount for a layer cake: 4 c. powdered sugar, 1/2 c. shortening, 1/4 c. milk and 1 tsp. vanilla. This is a great go-to recipe when you need a cake that's beautiful, easy, and delicious!",

It is wonderful on it's own but with the addition of the cookies...it was fantastic! After it cooled...I also melted about  a cup of giradelli chocolate chips with a little bit of cream and drizzled it on top. If you do not add too much cream...after a while...the chocolate hardens almost like candy on the cake which makes it extra yummy. Sorry but I just could not use this recipe with the box cake mix because no matter what you put in it...you know that it started from a box. Try the cake the way I mentioned and I can guarantee....you will not be dissapointed.",

For those that are leary about using raw eggs remember you can always buy pasterized eggs or pasterize them yourself by placing the egg in boiling water that is 145 degrees for 3 and a half minutes and then immediatly putting in ice water. This will kill any bacteria in the eggs. I also made one with chocolate cake and I actually liked it better. It tasted just like an Oreo cookie.",

There's really not much taste at all to this and the icing left a strange waxy film on the roof of my mouth. However I did make this for the kids and they were thrilled. It did turn out pretty especially with the crumbled cookies all over and sliced ones all around the top. It is very easy and cheap to make a no-brainer that might be appropriate for a bake sale (because of the novelty of it) or a kids birthday party. But I would never serve to adult guests...there are way too many extraordinary boxed cake recipes from this website (\"chocolate cavity maker cake\" for example)that make this one look a little silly.",
