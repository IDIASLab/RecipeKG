You still use the eggs and oil. I use French vanilla flavored pudding mix. I have only ever used a 9X13 pan and no nuts. So I will have to try nuts sometime. I have made this recipe for years but the lady I got it from was from the south and she called it Pea Picking cake. A light and moist dessert that everyone loves!!",
