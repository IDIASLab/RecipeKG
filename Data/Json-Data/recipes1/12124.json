Otherwise, your guests will find themselves picking bits of tomato skin out from between their teeth.\n-Seed the cucumbers before chopping\n-Saute the garlic in olive oil for about a minute, and add both garlic and oil to the mixture.  (I dislike using raw garlic in anything, because it tends to add an unpleasant bite even in minute quantities)\n-Cut sugar down to 1/2 tsp\n-Substitute extra fresh tomatoes for 1 cup of the tomato juice\n-Skip tarragon\n-Skip green onions\n\nFor garnish:\n-Minced red bell pepper\n-Fresh parsley\n-Chopped hard-boiled egg (very practical of the folks in Andalucia to add protein)\n\nOn the side:\nWe had some leftover polenta, which I sprinkled with shaved parmesan and served with the gazpacho instead of the usual crusty bread + ham.  Delicious!\n",
