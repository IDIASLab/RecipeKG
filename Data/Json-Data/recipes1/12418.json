I placed these in short, clear cups, and they were beautiful.  Lots of praise when they came out, and more after the first bite.  THANKS!!!",

The best combination was french vanilla & butter pecan - but I can no longer find butter pecan pudding in an instant. Very delicious with slices of strawberries or bananas on top along with sprinkles of the pecans. So fam. favorite now is vanilla with banana cream. I have made the crust in a 9x13 pan before but like to double the ingredients to get a fuller crust.",

It also serves an army! I like playing with this varying the flavors of pudding (try vanilla and add a layer of bananas or strawberries) crusts (graham cracker and Oreo crusts are easy and work well) and garnishes (crushed Heath bars with the chocolate version are dangerously delicious). Another thing that s great about this is that it s dependable because it turns out great every time therefore if you have a dessert to bring to a gathering or need one to give away you can turn to this one confidently as I ve done on this occasion. I ve never know anyone who could resist this dessert. (Note: if making this version use butter not margarine for best flavor)",
