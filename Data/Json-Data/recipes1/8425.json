I took other reviewers advice and cut down the mayonnaise the worcestershire and traded in some of the salt for garlic or onion powder instead. I used fresh parsley and frozen shrimp too. I would definitely add more shrimp than what is called for - otherwise you don't get meat in each bite. I hate rating a recipe I changed so much but this is definitely a keeper!",

As other reviewers have mentioned what turns out to be a pinch over 1 tbls. of salt is WAY to much (and I like salty stuff!). Use onion powder in place of onion salt and garlic powder in place of garlic salt then only use about 1 tsp. celery salt at most! In addition 3 tbls. of Worcestershire sauce is over-powering to the point that the dip tastes like Worcestershire dip! At most use 1 tbls. We added an additional can of shrimp to see if we could compensate for the flavor of the Worcestershire sauce with limited success! I truly believe with the reduction in salt and Worcestershire sauce this dip would be outstanding.",
