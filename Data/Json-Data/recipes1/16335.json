I came across this recipe and loved it for a nice light summer dinner! I didn't measure; just chopped and cooked. Following the great tip from Naples I added the diced chard stems with the mirepoix...no need to be wasteful! I didn't add the full 2# of chicken because I didn't want to:) and I subbed a 15oz can of diced tomatoes for the crushed as it's what I had on hand and wouldn't want to open a can for just a cup anyways. I used farfalle because I didn't want to buy pasta just for this. A lovely recipe that has great flavor! I served with fresh fruit and a garlic-herb bread. Happy satisfied bellies! (Until my boyfriend jokingly asks \"what's for dinner?\" when he's hungry again in an hour or so.):)",
