I had to use mine almost immediately and while it was still very good, it definately improved with some time. Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed.",

I prefer to use dehydrated \"Real-Lemon\" powder instead of lemon juice (it makes it less runny) and I double pickles (at least) but drain them on paper towel first, again so that it is not runny.  I have also used horseradish instead of onion which gives it a different, but not unpleasant, taste. Leaving it to marry in the fridge is advised as it really brings the flavors together.",
