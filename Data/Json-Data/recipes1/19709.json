I watched the video first which is always a plus.  I did make one change and that was to use vanilla bean paste in place of vanilla extract.  I like seeing the vanilla beans in the ice cream and the flavor was oh so good!!!  Thank you Chef John for sharing such an EXCELLENT recipe!  I will be making this many times over!",
