It is a very flakey tender pie crust with just a hint of sweetness.This recipe is almost fool proof you can not go wrong with this one. I didn't even have to brush it with an egg or milk for it to turn golden brown. It is realy wonderful. This pie dough is very easy to work with also. It rolls out very nice doesn't crack or break apart easily like the recipe I usualy use. Minde you the recipe that I usualy use I a very good one but this one is easier to work with and turned out great. Can't wait to try out an apple pie with this recipe. I know it will be great. I wonder if you can freeze this pie dough made with 7up?",

I used a generously floured pastry cloth and covered my rolling pin with a cloth cover. Wonderful recipe no more refridgerated dough for me!",

I threw in a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar for the heck of it and pulsed the dry ingredients with the butter. Then I poured in 3 oz. of the beer. I dumped it out on a floured board and lightly shaped it in a ball to be placed in the fridge wrapped in Saran. The consistency was perfect. I think the secret might be in very cold butter a smaller recipe and very little handling. Don't know about the taste yet but will let you know.",
