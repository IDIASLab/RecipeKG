I KNEW that when I put those on the oiled grill that the yummy mixture would just fall off and burn (yet I still did that--go figure). I think that the next time I make this (and there will be a next time) I'll try putting the chicken sealed in foil on the BBQ opening it for the last few minutes or so. Or I will just put all the mixture on the top after turning it and forget the bottom of the chicken. We loved the flavor of the mustard sauce! I could even try using a skillet on my stove next time. Thank you! We loved the flavor of our dinner tonight!",

Maybe thicken the sauce a little for the grill for the next time or pan fry with the sauce might work better. I'll tweak the next time full of flavor though! Thanks for the recipe.",
