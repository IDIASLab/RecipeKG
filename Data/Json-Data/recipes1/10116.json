I didn't have any brown sugar so I use 3/4 c. of white sugar and dipped my leveling knife into molasses and added that to the mixture. I also took a tip from one of the other reviews and used cocoa powder instead of chocolate chips and I feel it strengthens the flavor of the banana. The dough was extemely sticky and I wasn't sure how they were going to turn out but like other reviews it's crisp on the outside with a soft and chewy inside. This is a recipe we will surely keep. It's a different type of cookie but my boys loved them. It almost seems hard to mess this recipe up so see what you can come up with.",

It seems the tastes of banana and peanut butter are fighting for dominance! And the chocolate chips at only 1/4 C are hardly enough to matter. I would either leave them out or put in a 1/2 C instead. I didn't mind them nice to have something sweet around but probably won't make them again.",
