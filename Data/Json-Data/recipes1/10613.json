I used a lemon cake and vanilla pudding for the frosting. I do not have lemon extract so I used zest and fresh juice of 2 lemons. If you are substituting for the extract it is important to taste the frosting and make sure it is lemony enough. If not keep adding zest and lemon juice until it is. I split the cake into 2 layers and sprinkled yellow non-parielles all over the top and served each piece with a fresh raspberry. (See Photo.)",

As others suggested, used lemon cake and lemon pudding, also substituted 1/4 c of water for lemon juice, and also zest of one lemon-divided between cake batter and icing.  Made a tiered 9\" round cake, and layered with raspberry filling.  Simple fruit filling recipe: use Polander seedless all-fruit spread, any flavor, microwave jar for approx. 30secs, and add in small box jello, in same flavor as fruit spread (I used all sugar free and fat free add-INS), whisk, cool completely (can even place in freezer for 10 mins), then spread on cake with desired layers.  So quick and simple-intense fruit flavor, and perfect spreadable texture, without soaking into even this moist cake!",
