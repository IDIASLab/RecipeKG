Make positively sure the egg whites are a ROOM TEMPERATURE! They won't get the consistency that's required if you don't. Also unless you have a stand-up mixer you will kill your arms. I put the mixture with the whisk attachment on my KitchenAid (on FULL BLAST) for a full 5 or 10 minutes to get the right texture. (Did I say make sure the whites should be at room temperature--LOL). Another great tool for these cookies is a cookie scoop. I don't use mine much but it was invaluable for these. My last suggestion is to cut the amount of sugar. I used the 1 & 1/4 cup amount the first time and they were a bit too sweet (and I LOVE sweet). I reduced the sugar to a SCANT cup. Everyone loved them.",

It comes out light and tall and not gooey like other recipes with condensed milk. I was surprised to grease and flour the pan (prepare) as I have always used parchments before but it worked very well. The macaroons must cool completely before removing and they just pop off. I dipped them in orange flavored chocolate and they were a hit! Enough to make for my daughters wedding reception. Word of caution...egg whites must be whipped in a very clean glass or metal bowl...with no oil or yolk to get a high peak.",

Shape can be improved and probably should use a little bit less sugar but nonetheless crunchy on the outside with chewy and moist center. I whipped the egg whites in a small steel pot (took a good 15 minutes or so by hand) used only vanilla extract and substituted creme of tartar for 3x the amount of lemon juice. I was careful to fold in the dry ingredients into the stiff egg white and sugar mixture. While baking my spooned heapfuls stayed airy but became quite a bit flatter. So after about 8 minutes of baking I removed the pan and using 2 spoons reshaped them. Maybe I will try to chill the mixture a little bit next time to see if shape holds better. Although my macaroons do not quite look like the store bought macaroons I'd say mine came out tasting nicer. I'll definitely use this recipe again!",

I added extra coconut to try and help it but they were way too soft & needed probably an extra 1/4 cup of flour and 1 cup of extra coconut. My egg whites were very large that may be part of the reason but still I think something needs to be adjusted. The flavor was very good though I dipped them in dark chocolate and for some I drizzled it over the top. I have to say WITH modifications I will consider making this again but for the recipe on it's own I have to give it 3 stars....sorry.",
