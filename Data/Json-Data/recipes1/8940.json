I did double the amount of brown sugar and butter it call for the bottom of the pan, wich was, to my taste, a very good choice.  The other thing I made different was 1/2 cup unsalted butter, just 1/2 cup sugar, and I sifted the flour with the baking powder, I don\u00b4t know why i did it because the recipe does not call for that step, but was glad I did, the cake was super moist, it was like eating silk, the flavour and texture was spectacular.\nI will try this again, for sure, with other fruits, but also without any fruit and this time, with no fruit, I will use 2/3 cups of sugar.  I really don\u00b4t like very sweet deserts, thats why when the cake is with fruit 1/2 cup of sugar is enough, but if there is no fruit, then I will need a little more sugar to compensate.",

Next time I'll make a little more of the butter/brown sugar mixture to put on the bottom because it was a smidge dry but the flavor was really good. Certainly will make again.",

Reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and used 4T. butter in the topping.  My family requested more \"goo\" next time so I will double the butter and brown sugar and see how that works.  I made this in my favorite cast iron skillet and it came out easily.  This one is definately going in the recipe box!  Thank you!",
