I knew it would need more seasoning so I made Traci s Adobo Seasoning also from this site and seasoned the chicken with that no additional salt and pepper. I also changed the cooking process quite a bit which I believe simplified everything. First I saut\u00e9ed my seasoned chicken in a little EVOO on the stove top until completely cooked through but still moist (25-35 min. as indicated in the recipe under my broiler would have produced burnt shoe leather). I transferred the chicken to a baking sheet lined with foil sprayed lightly with non-stick cooking spray topped with the cheese and popped under the broiler for just about 30-40 seconds not too long or most of the cheese will melt off onto the foil. I kept the chicken warm while I saut\u00e9ed the mushrooms in the same skillet I had used for the chicken until nicely browned. Then I couldn t help but add a splash of white wine to the mushrooms and let it cook off almost completely. When plating I topped the chicken with the mushrooms and served. I might also add that I never saut\u00e9 mushrooms or anything for that matter covered sort or defeats the purpose by creating condensation that will hinder the browning. A decent recipe but nothing noteworthy. I do think the Traci s Adobo Seasoning and my addition of white wine improved this greatly from the original recipe.",
