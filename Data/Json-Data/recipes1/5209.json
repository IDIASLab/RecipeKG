He will not eat zucchini in any form--ends up giving most of the zucchini to neighbors.  I took some of this cobbler to them, and just told them it was a delicious cobbler--then told him to tell me what kind of cobbler it was.  Of course he said \"Apple\".  When I told him it was zucchini, he wouln't believe me.  I had to go accross the street and bring the recipe to show him.  His wife now has the recipe, and he might eventually try zucchini in other tasty dishes.  A real hit with everybody who has tried it.  Thanks Beverly for sharing this delicious recipe.   Gordon",

The texture was the same because I halved seeded and sliced the veggie pretty thin. I also used half brown sugar an half white because I love the flavor that brown adds along with 1/2 of the flour replaced with quick oats. Even when eating the zucchini pieces without any crumb topping at all it is EXACTLY like an apple. Who knew?! Also this dessert is not too sweet. I keep walking in to taste it and can't believe it.",
