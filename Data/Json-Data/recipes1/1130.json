She first added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract to the cream cheese mixture. Then the order used was lady fingers on bottom and sides, half the cream cheese mixture, another lady finger layer, all of the strained strawberries, the strawberry juice/cornstarch mixture (with 1/2 to 3/4 cup reserved), the rest of the cream cheese mixture, then in a spoke pattern add the reserved juice mixture.  With a skewer, swirl the spokes until a pretty pattern emerges.  Pile fresh strawberries in center.  Garnish with mint sprigs and white chocolate curls.  It won her first prize in the local Strawberry Festival.",

                "reviewBody": "The first time I made this I found the 11 oz cream cheese overpowering, so I've always used 8 oz after that.  Even then I think I could use with a bit less cream cheese, but that's totally up to personal taste. Then, because of the other reviews, I layer instead of putting the ladyfingers on the sides -- this allows the ladyfingers to soak in moisture and better complement the texture of the cream.  I just use a nice, transparent flat-bottomed rectangular glass bowl and it still looks good enough to serve at a party.  And the most important tip -- since I use fresh strawberries, I mash them and instead of putting aside the strained strawberries, I fold them into the whipped cream/cream cheese mixture.  This transforms it into a really strawberry dessert instead of just a strawberry-and-cream concoction.  Although shaved chocolate looks good as a topping, I think it deflects the taste of strawberries, so I don't recommend it.  This is a really good strawberry refrigerator cake.",

I followed some other's advice and cooked down a bag of frozen strawberries with 3/4 cup of sugar and 2 tbs. cornstarch (making sure to mix the cornstarch with some of the strawberry juice first). Then I pureed the mixture in a blender and let it cool. I did cut down some of the ladyfingers because they were too tall when I was assembling the sides. After I put the cake together, I poured the cooled strawberry mixture on top of the entire cake. I chilled the cake for 24 hours, and then used the leftover cream mixture to pipe rosettes around the top border and in the very center of the cake, and used fresh strawberries to border the bottom of the cake (and one on the top for good measure). I will definately make this again, and next time, I'd like to put sliced fresh strawberries in the cream filling too. Thanks so much for such an elegant recipe!",

So what I ended up doing first was laying down the lady fingers on the bottom on the pan and pouring 1/2 of the cream cheese/whipping cream mixture on top of those. Then I insert the lady fingers around the edge of the pan. It helped them stand up straight and hold them in place. Once I had inserted all the cookies around the edge I poured the rest of the mixture on top and added the strawberry topping. The strawberry topping was a little bitter, so I would suggest sifting a little powdered sugar on top of that. Tasted wonderful. Very simple recipe - Will definitely make it again!!!!",

They even said it was better than a similar cake from a famous New York bakery! I did simplify the recipe a little by using frozen whipped topping instead of fresh cream. I also used a 24 oz package of frozen sweetened strawberries and layered the strained strawberries and a little of the glaze over the lady finger in the center layer of the cake. I used the rest of the glaze on the top of the cake, as directed, and decorated with fresh, whole strawberries. I refrigerated over night and WOW!

I had a 10in springform pan so I used 16oz cream cheese, 8oz cool whip vs. heavy cream (only to save time), and doubled everything else, which was perfect! It filled all the way up to the top without overflowing. For the vanilla I sub'd half for almond and was happy with the result. I followed another reviewers suggestion on layering: ladyfingers, 1/2 filling, drained strawberries, 2/3 thickened strawberry sauce, other 1/2 of filling and then remaining 1/3 of sauce. Swirl sauce with filling and top with shaved chocolate, mint sprigs & a few sliced strawberries! Simply beautiful. Chilled for about 8 hours and when I removed the pan sides it held together!
