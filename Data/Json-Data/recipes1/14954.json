I hate when people drastically change recipes, but I couldnt find anything on here with all the KEY ingredients for great egg salad.  This recipe had a great start.  I just added some finely diced celery for crunch, 1 tsp dill weed (gotta have dill in your egg salad sandwich), 1/2 tsp onion powder instead of the green onions (didnt have any on hand) and used dijon mustard for a little more flavor.  Turned out great, I ate half of it before it even made it to the fridge for lunch the next day.",

It IS delicious, taking me back to earlier days and a simpler style of cooking. (For me that would mean waaaay back in the day :)  I mean, didn't everyone's mom make egg salad just like this?  This is good just as is, but you can doll it up any way you like.  For me, that meant adding celery, because for us it just isn't egg salad without it.  But in the end, this is an egg salad recipe for what it is -  a good, basic, classic, egg salad, and not for all the fussier things it isn't.",

Took just minutes to chop up all the eggs!\n\nFor perfect hard-cooked eggs, the Broiler & Egg Association of Minnesota says to place eggs in single layer in covered saucepan in cold water, bring to boil, remove from heat and let stand for 15 minutes.  Once the time has elapsed, place eggs in ice water until cool.  This works beautifully - the eggs are done to perfection, there's no green edges, and they peeled quite easily, no tearing!",
