Honestly I wanted to but could not find them in the pantry had a clear out last week when I did a sell by date check and thought I must have thrown them away then but once I put all the ingredients I had used back in the pantry found them in the wrong place!!! Anyway back to the cookies I used a mixture of chocolate chips and heaths toffee pieces. I cooked half of the cookies and then froze half as dough balls to bake at a later date love these cookies and can't wait to try them next time with the cracker crumbs!!!!",
