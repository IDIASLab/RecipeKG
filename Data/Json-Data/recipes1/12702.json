I warmed my cream cheese in the microwave and added vanilla and salt to cream cheese along with actually UNSIFTED powdered sugar.  I used the 3% cornstarch kind that may have helped.  While I was prepared to add butter or milk I used my choclate right off the burner and did not need any added ingredients. By using everything warm and adding the chocolate very last I was putting it in the pan right as it began to firm up. I used the back of a spoon and hot water to smooth the top. I also used seran wrap instead of foil so I could just fold it over and store it as is. It is creamy and easy to work with.  THANK YOU!!!",
