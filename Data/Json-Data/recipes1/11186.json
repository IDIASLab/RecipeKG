I use a combination of red and green peppers, red and vidalia onion for color and flavor but no matter what you use or your preference you're bound to have a great outcome. I also use the optional wine - red or white whatever I have on hand and I never have any shortage of that! The herbs always give it a nice touch whether you use fresh or dried but just a bit so as to not overpower the veggies.

I have used a little balsamic vinegar instead of wine, also a little chicken broth if I need a little more moisture.  Experiment with your herbs - this is very adaptable.",

I had bought some mini red, orange and yellow bell peppers at the store and I was looking for a recipe on the allrecipe.com site and I found this one. I didn't have any red onions so I just used yellow ones. I wasn't sure how many peppers to cut up because they ranged in sized from a banana to a chili pepper. I also used more than a pinch of salt,pepper and basil. Then I added two pinches of fresh minced garlic. I baked some boneless pork chops in the oven with salt pepper and a tiny pinch of fresh minced garlic. Then I drizzled some extra virgin olive oil on top and when they were done I served them with the peppers on top. OH MY GOSH! As we ate this dish we couldn't imagine the peppers tasting better on anything else. Crow, you have a winner here with me. I wonder how some toasted pine nuts on top would be.",
