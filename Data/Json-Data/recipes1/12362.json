Although I had heard and made \"slippery nipples\" before I thought this would be a neat twist and the vodka wouldn't make it as sweet (for those anti-sweet drinkers). Not true. Everyone who tried these agreed that although they were okay the plain ol' slippery nipple was much better. Sorry but I won't serve these again.",
