As I was making this I was second guessing the recipe - 'Maybe I should brown the chicken....' etc...etc... I decided to trust the recipe and I am so glad I did. One comment - there is a lot of chicken fat that needs to be skimmed off. If making this for company I would make the whole thing the day before - remove the chicken and vegetables - skim off as much fat as possible and refrigerate it - then skim off more fat once it had thoroughly chilled. Re-heat on low - make the rice and you have a wonderful flavorful easy meal. NOTE: You can use chicken pieces in this but they need to be bone in skin on to give this dish that extra flavor. Remove the skin and bones prior to adding the chicken back into the sauce. Thanks Chef John for another keeper to add into the rotation.",

I used 4 chicken legs with the thighs attached because I didn't want to take a whole chicken out and cut it up. It cooked faster, about 1 hour. Also, I was worried it would be too spicy for my kids, so I only added 1 jalape\u00f1o. It gave nice flavor, but no spice at all, so if you like a little zip I don't think both jalape\u00f1os and the cayenne pepper would be too much at all. I will put them all in next time. Amazing & awesome! Thank you for a great recipe!",

I did not give up the sour cream yet by using skinless breasts it did eliminate a good bit of the fat calories and this dish was still amazing. I used roasted jarred red peppers. I added the cilantro toward the end so that the fresh flavor was not cooked out of it. I did not add the sour cream until I had taken the chicken out of the broth at the very end just before serving. I could see that the broth was very thin and I desired it thicker so I mixed 1/4c of Wondra flour into the sour cream making sure that the flour and sour cream were well mixed before I added it....did not want any flour lumps. I then added the mixture to the broth at a low temp and mixed until it thickened. It came out beautifully thickened and the sour cream sauce stayed perfect. Be patient with the thickening at the lower temperature....you do NOT want to boil the sour cream or it will separate.",
