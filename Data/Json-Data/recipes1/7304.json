There were more than we could east so I decided to make this pie.  I cut each grape in half lengthwise and squeezed them as hard as I could into the pan, skins included.  Then I followed the recipe as provided.  The pie turned out delicious!  I was surprised at the flavoring as it had almost a rhubarb hint.  I had never heard of grape pie previously, but now I have a new recipe in my book!",

Instead I put the entire bunch of whole grapes into the pan and mashed down on them some and turned on the heat. I stirred in part of the sugar to bring out the juices and cooked down the grapes. Between the sugar continuing to mash the grapes and cooking down it released most of the liquid. Furthermore by not removing the skins the color of the grapes were brought out without having the skins in the pie. I then strained everything through a strainer (leaving behind seeds and skin) and added the remainder of the sugar to taste.",

I am withholding one star because of preparation- separating the grapes and skins is time consuming and I became VERY frustrated separating the pulp from the seeds. I might have had exceptionally seedy grapes but I was ready to give up when my husband suggested putting the pulp/seed mix into the lettuce spinner. Two rounds of that separated everything and I continued with the recipe. So- fantastic result but some frustration getting there.",
