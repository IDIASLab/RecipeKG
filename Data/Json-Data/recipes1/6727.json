First of all I added all the wet ingredients then the dry (even the cranberries and nuts) then turned it to the dough setting. Once it reached the end of the dough cycle I kneaded a little and dropped in a greased pan. I glazed the top with beaten egg and cooked in the oven as usual. Great tasting breakfast bread perfect with a smear of butter!",
