The dough was a little difficult to work with -- so I cheated and rolled it out between two sheets of waxed paper, set it on a cookie sheet, froze it for about 20 minutes, then cut out the frozen dough.  (I do this with almost all cut out cookie dough. It works great and the cookies don't lose their shape!)  Since I used small cutters, I reduced the baking time to 10 minutes.",
