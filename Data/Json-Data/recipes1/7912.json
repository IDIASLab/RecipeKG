If you are a connoisseur of mincemeat, you will be able to tell this is a good recipe while you are cooking it, and you add the spices to the fruit, and it magically changes to that wonderful aroma of....mincemeat! If you want to, you can omit the meat in this recipe. I prefer peach or apricot brandy for this recipe. If desired you can use half beef and half pork rather than all pork.",

I made a batch and froze it in Ziplock freezer bags and it was even more delicious half a year later! Two thumbs-up!!! This is about ten years later and I just made this recipe again. I'm putting it in FoodSaver bags now and vacuum sealing it. It's SO GOOD!!! Now that my kids are older I'll be keeping this in the freezer each year! I just measure about four cups of mincemeat and put it in a FoodSaver bag and freeze it. One recipe makes almost 5 four-cup bags. Delicious! Yum!!",

Next I could not find gooseberries so used dried currants that I plumped up in hot water before using. Also I only used the zest of the lemon & used only the zest & juice of the orange. I got 5 quarts & 1 pint out of this recipe. Very good to make Mincemeat Bars which is a recipe on this website. Labor intensive but well worth it if you like mincemeat.",
