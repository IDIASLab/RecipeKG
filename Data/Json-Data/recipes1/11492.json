For pinching, every third dumpling or so I dipped my fingers into some flour; otherwise the whole glob just kept sticking to my fingers. I made them a bit bigger but they were still cooked all the way through; I cooked them in beef broth with a clove of garlic added in. Sprinkled with parsley right before serving; next time I will try adding some herbs to the dough itself. So good for how simple this recipe is, thanks!",

My grandmother used to make this & when she couldn't find her Spaetzle press, she spooned in about 1/4 tsp. at a time into boiling water, submerging the spoon in the water, so it cleans off and other spaetzle don't stick to the spoon.

The 1/2\" pinch of \"batter\"? Did this mean half inch square half inch long? Who knows. This was my first time trying this dish and I would have liked more in depth instructions. It yielded maybe two decent servings.",
