Then I added about 2 T of softened/melted peanut butter as the last ingredient while omitting the raisins.  I thought the batter was to die for, but then I tried a cookie.  It was fluffy and moist on the inside.  Perfect in my book! They remind me of my childhood fav- no bake cookies.  So I guess these are Bake, No-bake cookies.  ",
