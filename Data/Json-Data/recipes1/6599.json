I omitted the alcohols and added cinnamon nutmeg and a pinch of mixed spice to make cinnamon cookies and they were divine - crisp on the outside moist and chewy on the inside. The only problem is that they're highly addictive - they're all gone after baking 16 last night! I'm keeping this recipe for future use.",

Also the recipe says 30 cookies but I made chips ahoy size cookies and it came out to about 70.",
