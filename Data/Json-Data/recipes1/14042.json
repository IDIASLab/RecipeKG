I can't see what you do with them later that would require dividing them. Also I like to have diced tomatoes in my sauce (personal preference) so I wish that this was different. I think that a large onion should be specified. I think the red pepper flakes were maybe a bit much for this sauce. Overall though great recipe and yes very versatile! Easily customizable to suit the individual; spices can be tweaked. This recipe has been out there since 2002 and only 2 reviews..... why??? Great recipe that needs to get more exposure.",

For spaghetti I add 1/2 lb of Italian sausage and 1 cup red wine nixing the red pepper flakes. For sloppy joes I make it a bit soupier not cooking it down so much. For chili I add back in the pepper flakes and add toasted chilis and chili powder. It uses are as limitless as your imagination.",
