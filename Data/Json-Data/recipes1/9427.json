The first time I used generic marshmallow cream.  I don't recommend using any store brand ingredients in this fudge.  The second time I used an enameled cast iron french oven, and it didn't turn out that time, either.  Every time I use my calphalon, it turns out great.  Also.....work fast!  The faster the better.  Don't start timing until the mixture is at a full, rolling boil and then reduce the temperature slightly so that it doesn't scorch.  Stir the entire five minutes and have the chocolate chips measured out ahead of time so you can dump them in as soon as you turn off the heat and stir like mad.  Get the chips fully incorporated and pour immediately.  It never fails!",

                "reviewBody": "Absolutely incredible fudge! It is perfectly smooth, creamy, chocolately, and all-around enjoyable. Try putting the marshmallow creme in the microwave for about 15 seconds before adding it to the pan; it will come out of the jar much easier. Though the cooking experience would have been less stressful with one, a candy thermometer really isn't necessary. One tablespoon of butter is just the right amount, and boiling the mixture for around 7 minutes instead of five can assure that the fudge will solidify. Some found that the recipe was a bit too sweet, so taking out 1/4 cup of sugar can tame some of the super-sweetness. Finally, using 2 cups of the semisweet chips and 1 cup of the milk chocolate chips instead of the other way around can make an even richer fudge (especially for those dark chocolate lovers like me). It is THE BEST fudge recipe around, and I am sure that I will make it again and again for years to come.",

It was so creamy - not grainy at all.  I have to say, though, that I messed up the first time I tried it.  Because I had the marshmallow creme in the very bottom of the pan and I got the heat too high too fast, I burned the marshmallow creme into hard brown chunks!  The second time, I kept the temperature at low until it was mixed up well and then I turned the heat up to medium and boiled it.  That worked like a charm.",

First, cook for 6-1/2 minutes, because at 5 minutes, it really needs to be kept in the fridge to maintain the right texture.  If you DO prefer the super-creaminess of the 5-minute cooking time, then it will be far less \"melty\" if, after refrigeration, you cut it into squares and let the squares \"air-harden\" on racks or trays until the sides are not tacky.  (Obviously, this is kind of a pain, so I go with the 6-1/2 minutes!)  And finally: This is too much butter.   1 tablespoon works well, and the butter can actually be left out completely if you like.",

I do want to offer you some tips in making fudge as it was passed along to me and it does make a difference. Do NOT substiute butter for margarine. Margarine has a higher water content and it will disturb the balance in fudge making. As well, you should also use whole evaporated milk. I found using 2%, 1% or fatfree evaporated milk, I don't get the absolute best results as i do with whole evaporated milk. I start out stirring until well blended on low heat first so that the sugar is completely disolved. This will prevent grainy texture. I've also been told not to make fudge in high humidity or rainy days as the moisture causes the fudge not to set as well which i guess i find that to be true today as it is raining and humidity is slightly high. Therefore, i do find this fudge is too soft. They say making fudge is very moody. This is the best recipe and will be a keeper in my family.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!",

The secret is to use a candy thermometer to be sure the fudge reaches the soft ball stage (234 degrees).  Ours didn't reach temperature until well after five minutes boiling time, possibly because we kept the flame low to prevent burning.  (Using a double boiler, as someone here suggested, is a great idea; we may try that the next time we make this.)",
