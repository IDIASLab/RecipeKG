Tips I live by to make this turn out every time.  1) DON'T bake the pretzel layer any longer than 10 minutes.  2) Double the amount of jello to make it proportional to the amount of cream cheese.  3) Let the jello chill to thicken slightly before spreading on the cream cheese layer.",

I read the reviews prior to making it and found it extremely helpful to do the following: 1) instead of using 2 cups of water, use 1 cup of boiling water to dissolve the package of gelatin, then add 3/4 cup strawberry juice/syrup, and then add the strawberries; and 2)put the gelatin/strawberry mixture in the fridge for about an hour or so to thicken a bit before pouring it overtop of the cream cheese mixture (this is very key for the success of the dessert).  I really think these changes helped to enhance the texture and flavor of the gelatin layer.  I highly recommend trying this.  I have taken it to two dinner parties now and cannot tell you how many compliments I received, my friends were thoroughly impressed.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!!!",

I also think the crust should be a bit sweeter- I will try it with white and brown sugar next time. As other readers have warned, this crust will turn to CEMENT if you cook it too long. Take it out after 10 minutes even if you don't think it's cooked. It will get hard as it sits! Roll the side of a drinking glass over the crust in the pan- it makes an easy job of pressing it in.",

If it was not offered during my family's Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday they would protest in rebellion!

PLEASE NOTE:  This is NOT a recipe that keeps for days...  it needs to be eaten within the first 48 hours as the pretzel crust breaks down and softens and it just does not do it justice - Hands down to the crunch in this salad, it's a winner.",

It calls for 2 cups pretzels, marg. instead of butter and 3 tsp.( I use heaping tsps.) sug. for crust. For cheese middle it is the same only it calls for 1- 8 oz cream cheese instead of 2. Top layer is 2 small pkgs. jello,water the same,but use 2-10 oz. cartons frozen strawberries. I like Birdseye brand in syrup. If berries are whole, I chop them up. It really needs to chill several hours. This is my most requested jello recipe ever! It really is like a dessert!  When I first made it, no one could figure out what the bottom was made of! You really must try. Thanks Tom!",

Two suggestions: 1) do not bake the crust any longer than the 10 minutes called for, even if you are adding extra pretzels, butter and sugar to the crust.  If the butter/sugar mixture gets too hot it will turn to cement and a chisel will be required for removing it from the dish- I found out the hard way and 2) when choosing your strawberries take note of the amount of juice they are sitting in and reduce the two cups of water by that amount.

I ONLY baked for 10 minutes as everyone suggested and I did let the jello/strawberries sit for an hour in the frig first. Even then they still seemed to pour onto the cream cheese layer fairly liquidy so I worried that it wouldn't gel but it did set up perfectly. The jello did not seep into the cream cheese. The pretzel crust certainly does get more mushy the longer it's in your frig after making so if you can eat all of this in 1-3 days, that's preferable.",

The prezel crust was soggy and the jello mixture seeped through the cream cheese mixture and the frozen strawberrys were a big mistake. I just don't understand what could have gone wrong. I followed the recipe to a \"T\". I will not be making this one again. (Please look at my other reviews I have only given one other negative review)",
