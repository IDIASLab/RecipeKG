Just one word of warning -- take the peels out of the syrup no later than 15 minutes after you put them in; I waited a few extra minutes and the sugar syrup crystallized before I could get the last couple out.  If that happens to you, just add some hot water to the pot.  It'll wash away some sugar, but the peels will still tasted great.",
