Since I was using boneless meat I thought it would cook quicker but it took the whole hour to get tender. The cranberry sauce I bought was a generic brand but I suggest using a name brand. The generic wasn't very chunky. Next time I'm thinking of using cocktail sauce instead of the Catalina dressing for some kick!",
