And it turned out great. The nicest part is that I did it in the crock pot...put everything in at lunch time, and it was ready for dinner. If you want to try it in the crock pot, I put it in for four hours at High, then did one more hour with the lid off , stirring every once in a while, so the sauce would thicken up. Crock pot is definitely the way to go. I also slided the bricket very thin, adn returned it to the sauce for a few minutes. Then piled it onto fresh kaiser buns. Wow!",

I also used Goodmans soup mix which isn't heavy on the dehydrated onions.   It was absolutely perfect.",

Then I used Gates BBQ sauce instead of chili sauce, a can of C2 (the lower-carb coke), and the soup mix. I put it all in the crockpot about noon on low and left for the day. When we came home around six, it was done and the house smelled great! We used the left-overs the next day for sandwiches. I am a real novice when it comes to cooking so I was impressed at how easy it was to make a restaurant-quality brisket. I will definitely be making this again!",

I enjoyed the slightly sweet and spicy taste from the cola and the chile. Actually I was expecting a strong syrupy taste but was pleasantly surprised. At 325 the beef came out tender and juicy making for several fine meals that go well with mashed potatoes or rice. However I felt the recipe could be jazzed up a bit without overpowering the natural beef flavor. To round out and complement the sweet spicy BBQ flavor perhaps rub a little coarse sea salt (one or two teaspoons) or even add a bit of thyme to give it a more complex flavor.",
