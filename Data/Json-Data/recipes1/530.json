I used this recipe with the assembly instructions from another recipe on this site (Neapolitan Cookies submittee by Missy) and it took some time but they were NOT difficult to assemble and definitely worth the time! I've copied Missy's assembly instructions below and applied them to the Spumoni recipe. It looks more complicated than it is...give it a try! Line a 9x5 inch loaf pan with waxed paper (I used a glass pan so I could see if the layers were even) and spread chocolate dough evenly in the bottom of the pan. Spread the pistachio dough evenly over the chocolate layer and top with cherry dough layer. Cover layered dough with waxed paper and place in the refrigerator until firm about 4 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Turn out chilled dough by inverting pan; peel off waxed paper. With sharp knife cut dough lengthwise in half. (I trimmed the outer edges so the cookier corners would be nicely squared) Slice each half of dough crosswise into 1/4 inch slices. Place slices on cookie sheet one inch apart. Bake 8 minutes minutes in the preheated oven until puffed but not browned. Remove to wire racks to cool.",

It's absolutely essential that you use the best ingredients including real butter or these will taste like. I opt for the \"au natural\" look and omit the food coloring they look fine.

After baking/cooling I dip one end into melted chocolate and everyone goes crazy! This is a fun recipe with beautiful results.:)",
