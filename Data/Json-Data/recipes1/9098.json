I couldn't have cared less if the bread was \"butterscotchy\" or not - I just wanted something moist, lightly caramel-colored and pleasantly sweet with brown sugar.  This delivered exactly what I was looking for.  I had some fresh cherries and blueberries to make use of and I deliberately chose this bread for them. Two tablespoons of butter (for one loaf) didn't seem like it would be enough to me so I added another tablespoon for good measure.  Whether or not that was necessary I don't know, but it made me feel better!  The bread has a nice, almost crackly crust, with a dense, moist, incredibly delicious interior.  The handful each of fresh cherries (pitted and quartered) and blueberries I added  made this bread absolutely exquisite.",

I halved the recipe to only make 1 loaf and that worked out fine. My hubby is a butterscotch lover so I really wanted a good butterscotch flavor and that was achieved. This smelled really good while baking and was very moist. I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I'm thinking my use of half whole wheat flour may have contributed to the dryness it seemed to have relatively quickly (a day or so later). I also added a handful of butterscotch chips which sank to the bottom darn it! It was a nice recipe to try but I think I'll find another recipe next time!",
