The dressing is unexpectedly delicious I'll be using the leftovers to marinate shrimp for tomorrow's dinner. I think the only thing that I was disappointed in was the texture (kind of slimy) but that may have been a result of how thinly I sliced all the vegetables. I think next time I'll add fresh pineapple (though on second thought it may overpower it) and maybe some almond slivers or soy beans to add more crunch. All in all a very flavorful salad that we'll make our own. BTW we paired it with spring rolls to make it a heartier albeit fresh dinner.",

The dressing also goes well with chicken and pork. Will certainly make again.",

Hubby said once plated it needed to be cut up so the flavors could marry. I used spring mix of lettuces since could not find \"mesclun\". So my outcome may have been different. The recipe ingredients say to use cilantro and then the steps say coriander? I used less cilantro than in recipe since that is so overpowering which certainly tones down the fishiness of the salmon.
