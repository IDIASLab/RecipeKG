I decided to go for a home made frosting instead of out of the can, and I'm glad I did. This is easy to make. I boiled it for about 20 minutes on medium, added the nuts and coconut and let cool.

I hate using partial containers of things like 8 ounces of evap milk from a 12 ounce can, so I upped the other ingredients accordingly...12 oz evap milk, 1 1/2 c sugar, 4 egg yolks, 3/4c butter, etc.  You can't have too much of this frosting.

The recipe as written wasn't quite enough to frost a double layer 8 inch cake.  I will make an additional 1/2 recipe to this next time - and will double the recipe if making a 3 layer cake.  **After making this a few times since rating I would suggest the following slight changes: 1/2c white & 1/2c brown sugar; also increase the coconut to 2c, pecans to 1.5c;  this perfects a box German Chocolate cake mix if you don't have time for scratch cake & works very well on cupcakes.**And, you must use patience and let this cool - cooling = thickening; plan ahead and let it rest for a few hours.",

Given that stovetops vary, it would've been helpful to know just how THICK to make it... ie) until it runs off the spoon very slowly. It took almost 30min of stirring to become what I considered thick enough (not even very thick) and that was at 3-4 heat. It would've been nice to know, since I was on a time schedule. I'll make it again probably, but I'll be more prepared for the amount of time this recipe will take!",

I made it in a 9x13 pan and there was plenty of frosting, enough so that I could enjoy a little straight from the spoon...you know, for quality control purposes. Will never try another version.
