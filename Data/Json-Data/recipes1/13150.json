It was just enough and it was just right.  If you let it set after baking like lasagna it will absorb the water from the\nsauce.  Also I had sprinkle bread crumbs on the top before baking.  Will be making\nthis again and again.  Very good.   Thank\nyou. forgot I had also added fresh basil \nfrom the garden.",

I salted the slices liberally and it pulled out a lot of moisture. After I removed them I let them cool and then patted them with paper towel to remove as much extra moisture as possible. (It worked). I used a jar of spaghetti sauce fresh mushrooms onions and a little wine for flavor. I also used a pound of ground turkey cooked and drained it and mixed with the sauce along with 5 cloves of fresh garlic. I used mozz cheese ricotta and parmesan. My hubby who is somewhat fussy told me that he would eat this again and again. Hence the 5 stars. It was a great starting point and if I were going to make it purely vegetarian I would add grated carrots and celery and maybe summer squash. But it really is worth a try.",
