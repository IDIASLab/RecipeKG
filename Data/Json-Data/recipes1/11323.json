I tell students that in all faculties there are rules and there are diversions and in diversions we find creativity. Technically Lasagna is a flat noodle; basically it is a starch used to bind (hold together) in layers and the potato resemblance in this creation achieves that purpose. The ingredients used here are substantial and the only caution I will offer is to suggest that a firm waxier potato (like Yukon Gold) be used otherwise this recipe offers flavour cosistency and imagination.
