Roasted squash and onion with lots of garlic and chopped red pepper then added 6 oz fresh baby spinach when combining all ingredients before putting back in the oven. I used Savory Garlic cooking creme and rotini because that's what I had on hand. Couldn't find the Touch of Philly cheese so I used a store brand cheddar blend. Overall I enjoyed this meal but feel that I should keep playing with it to make it a true 5 star recipe.",

I made it slightly different because I had to substitute regular cream cheese italian seasoning for the cooking creme. I put the squash onion red pepper and italian seasoning in the pan with oil covered in the oven 30 minutes. At that time I took it out added the cream cheese cut in cubes returned it to the oven and started the pasta cooking. When pasta was ready I took it out mixed it all up with 1/2 of the shredded cheese then added the pasta mixed it up and topped with cheese. I then returned it to the oven about 15 minutes to melt the cheese. On the second try the only thing I did differently was I realized the squash ended up mashed so I just ran it through the mandolin slicer. It seemed to cook faster being in smaller pieces.",
