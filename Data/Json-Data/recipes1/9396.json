I made it last night and I got scared towards the end of the baking time because the top looked dried out so I took it out about 7 minutes shy of what the recipe called for. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter. It turns out I should have trusted the recipe because the center was more than gooey it was undercooked. However... that is not the end of the story. My husband and I both had a piece while it was still warm we couldn't resist after smelling it baking! As described above the center was hot and very gooey too gooey actually but towards the outer edge it became incredible... dense and moist and chocolatey.... perfect in fact. I put it in the refrigerator overnight and today it is FABULOUS... even the undercooked inside is now more like the inside of a truffle and then it gets cakier towards the outside. I am baking another one tonight and will follow the recommended baking time religiously... otherwise I won't change a thing. I used my coffee grinder to grind the sliced almonds my husband brought home from the store so if you're wondering how to grind your almonds that worked perfectly for me. Turned the almonds into a fine-textured meal almost like flour. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a rich decadent and VERY chocolatey dessert. It will not disappoint.",
