The texture is great as well - creamy and fluffy. But it was prettier to look at than it was to eat. I believe it is a combination of factors that made this not as good for flavor -the fact that it was all shortening made the taste flat. Maybe a pinch of salt would have helped that. The almond flavoring while it keeps the frosting white is harsh. I miss the buttery vanilla flavor of other frosting recipes I've tried which are far better. This was one occasion where I pushed most of the frosting off to the side of my plate...",

I like the almond flavoring but you can also use butter flavoring if you prefer the butter flavor.  Actually butter can be used rather than the shortning but then you will not have a true white frosting that decorators want.  I have also substituted any number of flavorings depending on what I wanted although almond is my personal favorite.

First I have to say this icing DOES have its place: It's very easy to make cheap and kept in an airtight container in the refrigerator it says good almost forever. I use this for practice all the time but I never eat it. The taste is vile. It's greasy and most people myself included find it way too sugary. There is no reason to serve this to people given there are actually tasty icing recipes out there that are still appropriate to decorate with. If you are coloring the frosting a traditional buttercream is wonderful. If you must have pure white: marshmallow fondant is good for icing an entire cake and boiled icing is great for writing and string work. If you need white flowers gum paste can do the trick. If you absolutely must have pure white piped flowers and there is no way around it I'd check gourmet stores or online to find some goat milk butter which is pure white if it isn't dyed.",

                "reviewBody": "The standard decorator frosting that most home cake decorators begin with. Admittedly it's lovely to look at and pipes like a dream. However the taste leaves a lot to be desired. When using only shortening it's essential to add some salt to the mix - just a little will suffice under 1/8 tsp - or the flavor will be dull like it's missing something. That much almond extract will be too strong for those who don't absolutely love almond flavor and there are many. Either half almond and half vanilla (clear if you want to preserve that stark white color) or half vanilla and half lemon are more generally appealing possibilities. Thin to use as a frosting for the entire cake but know ahead of time that this recipe might well be considered too sweet. For me this isn't the overall taste I'm looking for. A frosting made with all or mostly shortening doesn't melt on the tongue the way I like. This frosting leaves a tell-tale gummy cloyingly sweet residue. This frosting is better when reserved strictly for decorating. When used for this purpose I find that cutting the ingredients in half gives me plenty to decorate a 2-layer or 9\" X 13\" cake. Be aware that this will develop a light crust when left exposed to the air for several hours.",
