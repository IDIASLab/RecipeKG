Of course pickle juice was added and when the soup was completely finished I stirred in a little bit of fresh chopped parsley. Excellent soup!!",

Its summer here in New Zealand and its going to be warm tomorrow so I thought a cold soup would be a nice starter. I'm also making Polish lasagna cabbage stew in my crockpot and Polish desserts.
