I have been vegetarian for 10 years so tasting like turkey wasn't really the goal. I did make some changes: after reading the suggestions in this section I first boiled the tofu in some vegetarian chicken flavored stock then processed it in a blender then pressed it with the weight overnight. I also substituted Bragg's Liquid Aminnos for Tamari and regular boxed stuffing mix for the stuffing; I also left out the rosemary as I didn't have any. I cooked the tofu turkey WITH the foil for about 3 hours reappling the glaze every 30 minutes or so. I also cooked it on parchment paper instead of greasing the pan so it didn't burn. It was really good: it looked and tasted like turkey! I also recommend the vegetarian gravy to serve with this (or mashed potatoes!)",

First of all the amount of Tamari used in this recipe makes the stuffing too salty. I even reduced the amount and added water to cut it down a bit. Furthermore the recipe calls for table salt? I had enough sense not to add any. Second the cooking time is way too long. 2 hours at 400 F? Come on get real. After only one hour the sugars in the marinade (from the OJ) started to burn. Third despite pressing the tofu with 35 lbs of weight overnight the texture was still spongy. Finally the tofu naturally bland never picked up any flavors from the stuffing and marinade. Bland AND spongy?!? My plan is to give a shot at a 12 Tofurky (the real deal) and see if it is better. It would certainly be a whole lot cheaper and easier to fix. Tofurky's giblet gravy is good.",

                "reviewBody": "The main thing here is- you need to have plenty of prep time. I personally have had fabulous results everytime I have made a Tofu Turkey for my daughter and myself. First off- I press the tofu overnight the night before Thanksgiving- usually for at least 12 hours so it really firms up. Then I hollow it out and add the stuffing (I use a really good natural stuffing that Whole Foods sells and add celery and other good stuff but do not ever add extra salt- there is plenty of that in the recipe as is. Once stuffed I then refrigerate it again for a few hours so it firms nicely and can be turned out into the cooking vessel. It's important to keep it covered with foil (hate using aluminum foil but what else can ya use?) and keep marinating it (I add apricot jam to the marinade and it really makes a lovely color and taste) often but COOK at low heat- I do it at 300 for about 2 hours so it won't burn. Serve with organic cranberry sauce and natural vegan gravy- mashed organic russett potatoes and organic yams...YUMMO!! I also make a vegan pumpkin pie made with silken tofu- recipe easy to find online. Happy Thanskgiving!!",

I didn't use her stuffing recipe but did follow the tofu/body part. don't hollow the tofu out create the interior cavity as the refrigerated tofu is being pressed by placing a round bottomed bowl in the tofu as a form. The tofu also needs a better marinade recipe it was pretty wimpy (and salty). I also tried to impregnate the tofu w/herbs & soaked it for a long long time and that seemed to work better. good luck.",

It is delicious and much better than anything I have had as a vegetarian. My Dad loves it and he is 83 years old! I steeped the tofu in sesame and soy sauce then put it in the colander. You can't cook it as long as it says it burns. So watch it carefully. It really is the best and you should try it!!",

There are a few things that I have learned that have helped me out. 1) For time I use a prepared stuffing. Since this is usually salty I try to minimize excess salt in other places. 2)I use a pizza pan it looks like a big mound but since I am usually cooking for 8-10 the shape doesn not matter. You have to take it easy on the marinade one time it was a little to salty taste first. My family loves this dish.

My children who are vegans love it too. And when it comes just out of the oven look out!:-) I have been making it now for three years and am always asked by the meat eaters if I'm bringing the tofu turkey.:-)",

I think 375 for both hours would be fine. It has very good flavor. It makes extra dressing which I circle around the \"bird\" and it makes a good presentation. Be sure to cover the \"bird\" with foil for the second hour too. It has great taste and isn't hard to put together. Add a little cranberry sauce and veges and you're set. Thanks!",
