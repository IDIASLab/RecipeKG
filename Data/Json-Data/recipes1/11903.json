I use 2 cans of tomatoes and green chilis (I like my jambalaya with a kick to it)instead of the stewed tomatoes, I use either smoked sausage or kielbasa instead of the sausage links, and I increase the rice to 2 cups with 4 cups of broths (I have a big family). Though I do reduce the hot sauce to 1 teaspoon if it is good quality hot sauce, but if you use generic or \"not-so-hot\" hot sauce then you can use the full 1 Tablespoon. I also add 1/4 teaspoon cajun seasoning and 1/4 teaspoon thyme if I have it on hand. Chicken breast is optional, good either with or without it.",

I removed the sausage and quickly sauteed my shrimp which I had already seasoned with Emerils essence. I removed the shrimp just before it was completely done and added my onions, plus scallions and two chopped green bell peppers and cooked until soft. I then added the tomatoes, sausage and rice and simmered until cooked thru. The shrimp went in during the last five minutes of cooking. Delicious and thanks for a great start.",

Instead of already cooked chicken I added about 1lb raw chicken tenders cut in chunks.  Ended up cooking it at a simmer for around an hour until the rice was tender.

                "reviewBody": "Update: 3-18-2009 I halved the recipe since there are only two of us. I used 2 cups leftover chopped up turkey for the the chicken. I sauteed the onion and then added 3 links of hot Italian turkey sausage raw and cooked until almost done. Then I followed the recipe adding the other elements and actually using real rice this time. I added a little more garlic powder and tabasco than it says for half a recipe and I used frozen already peeled/cooked shrimp. When there were about 8 min. left I put the still frozen shrimp into the pot. They were medium sized so I would use less time or more depending on the size. It was much less watery and the leftovers were delicious (instead of tolerable). So easy and I still don't have an electric skillet but it was still very little clean up.    2-15 2007 I had no electric skillet and I didn't want to make as much as this said so my methods were a bit different. I took one large onion and sauteed in the oil. I used 2 boil in bag instant rice and boiled this and set aside. With the remaining water i dumped most and then added 1 can of chicken broth to about half a cup of the starchy water. I didn't have leftover chicken breast so I boiled that in the chicken breast and shredded it in th pan.   While the chicken was boiling I took the entire pound of hot turkey sausage and browned it with the onion (crumbled) and one clove of garlic plus garlic powder. Once this was done I used one can of stewed tomatoes drained and added it to the sausage. Onc",
