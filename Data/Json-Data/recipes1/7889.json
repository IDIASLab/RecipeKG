People may even ask to make sure I am bringing them.  They are a fantastic little snack that are just as good cooled off as they are right out of the oven.  I definitely take the advice of others, and totally smother the bacon wrapped smokies with brown sugar...the more the better.  I have found that they turn out perfect when I wrap them up the night before, put them in a covered bowl with the brown sugar, toss well, and let \"marinate\" all night.  Then, covering them with all of the sauce they've created, I bake them for an extended time until crisp.  Not being surprised if they take 45 minutes.  The bacon must be crisp for my taste.  It's even better if midway, you turn them.  You won't be disappointed with all of the compliments you'll receive.",

Definitely use a broiling pan with slits so the fat and suagr can drip through and away from the sausages, otherwise you'll have a greasy, soppy mess. I used center cut bacon as someone suggested..I used 3 lbs. of the bacon for 2 pkgs. of the Lit'l Smokies, cutting each piece of bacon in half (crosswise). I dredged the bacon in brown sugar before rolling it around the sausage, then put the rolls in a ziploc bag with more brown sugar coating all of them (as suggested.) They sat in the fridge all day and were soaked in syrup when I went to broil them . I broiled on the center rack of my electric oven for 10 to 12 minutes on each side (til browned and crispy), sprinkling with more brown sugar after turning. I've never seen anything I've made disappear so fast. Served with the dipping sauce someone else suggested-1/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup red chili sauce, and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar...it's perfect with them. The sauce needs to be mixed well ahead of time for sugar to melt and flavors to meld. Absolutely delicious appetizer! Try it for your next gathering!! (P.S., I thought these were more of a 'manly' appetizer, but they were equally popular withe the women.)",

I've made them 4 times now and they are always the first to go at a party.  I only write this review (it has enough positives already!) because I found a way to make the cooking time go faster, produce less mess and get more sugar to \"stick\".  I cut the bacon into thirds (too much bacon makes the outside crisp but the inside still undercooked) , dredge both bacon and smokies in the sugar to marinate (per advice of other reviewers), set them on a large plate with paper towels underneath and microwave them for approximately 1 min 30 secs, checking on them at every 30 sec. interval.  After this, I switch the smokies into a pan and bake in the oven for 5 min and then, after sprinkling another layer of brown sugar, I broil for 4 or 5 min.  The microwaving does the initial cooking and crisping of the bacon, but more importantly, catches all the fat that makes them greasy and tends to melt off the sugar.  The additional cooking finishes off the baking and crisping and then the additional sugar and broiling produces that carmelized glaze.  I also find that I don't need the toothpicks ~ I just stretch the bacon around and it sticks to itself.  Enjoy!  They're totally worth the fuss! and Thank You TINA!!!",

To solve the brown sugar dilemma, I put about 2/3 cup of brown sugar in a mixing bowl, and rolled each smokie/bacon piece in it before placing it on a broiler pan, which I then put in the oven.  Using a broiler pan allowed the fat to drain off while baking.  It worked well, and each bite got it's share of the brown sugar glaze.",

(I sprinkle them about three times total during the cooking time....I like them better with more sugar than the recipe states.) I broil them for about 15 minutes or until bacon is crisp (center rack). Thank you so much for sharing the recipe Tina! I'll use this one for my Superbowl party and for many parties to come!",
