I increased the amount of hot sauce about tenfold and doubled or tripled the garlic and cumin but to no avail. The texture of the mix was kind of chunky and I couldn't get them out no matter how hard I tried. Really this was a platform for the tomato onion and cheese. I omitted lettuce because I don't like it. I used red onion for flavour and colour and added diced avocado chunks for colour and texture. (If you do this beware avocado turns brown in open air after a while.) It would be well to have small diced jalapeno as well. It turned out okay because I increased the topping portion but I would not make this again.",

The cream cheese / sour cream layer needs a lot more hot sauce. I used Tapatilo and didn't really measure but I think it would be about 2 tsps. Dice the lettuce really small. Instead of just tomatoes and onions use a spicy Pico de Gallo - fresh salsa. There wasn't a scrap left on the plate and that is a good sign.",
