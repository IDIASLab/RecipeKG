I cut them in half and dry them on paper towels. To me they make a prettier leaf and berry design. Also they actually add a more flavorful taste. To the young man who felt he had 'wasted' the ingredients in the 'Rocks' he baked...You must read the times and temperatures in the recipe. It says to only bake 10-12 min. It also says it is not supposed to brown. You paint a bit of egg white on the wreath and sprinkle sugar upon it. Yo could switch to green decorator sugar but it only calls for sanding sugar The dough only has to set up - not brown up. Cookies that brown on top usually get iced later. You might be happier buying the pre-made sugar cookie dough at the grocery store. Just slice off a 1/2\" s;ice roll it into a 8\" rope make a wreath shape overlapping the ends. Add the colored fruit prior to baking. If you want the tops to brown bake for the time on the package. Buy a tube of pre-made green icing. Put on a star tip and decorate your wreath. You could even substitute Redhot Cinnamon Candies for the berries. Good luck!",
