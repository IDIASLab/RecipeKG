My colleagues were a little skeptical of the dish based on the title, however, they tried and loved it! I've received several requests for the recipe and I am making it for a cookout today. TIP 1: Make sure you drain the pineapple and THEN only add 8 tbsp of the remaining juice. \n\nTIP2: It tastes better with only 3/4 cup of sugar.",

The biggest thing to note is that IF you are using pineapples in heavy syrup then of course you don't need extra sugar (as some reviews has said, because heavy syrup is sugar). If you use pineapples in their own juice with no added sugar then you can safely add the sugar. Also I made this recipe gluten free by changing some of the ingredients to gluten free ingredients and it came out just great. You can buy gluten free crackers and use gluten free flour in place of the gluten filled ingredients",

Also I like to use pineapple tidbits better than chunks since they are smaller and make the flavors and textures mesh better. I drained my pineapple out of the can and reserved the juice for later uses also I did not add the 8 tablespoons of juice since the pineapple were still very juicey. I think the extra 8 tablespoons would have made this casserole too mushy for many tastebuds (including mine.) Thanks for this recipe it's a keeper.",
