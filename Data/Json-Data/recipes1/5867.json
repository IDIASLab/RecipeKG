It\u2019s great by itself, or for a full dinner we like to grill some chicken breasts and throw it all on baked corn tortillas with lettuce for a tostada salad. The only changes to the actual salad we make are that we use finely diced purple onion instead of the green onion and add a bit more spice to the dressing. I\u2019m not a cilantro fan by any means, but I think it\u2019s vital to this salad. I just chop it very fine and use a little less. The only problem I have with this salad is that it doesn\u2019t make the best leftovers. It\u2019s tasty the next day, but the tang of the lime and the cilantro can\u2019t survive the cold of the \u2018fridge overnight and it loses it\u2019s \u2018zing.\u2019 Definitely the best on the day it's made.",

Helpful Hints:  Grill your corn instead of using frozen, add 1/2 tsp of cumin and please make sure you use FRESH lime juice not the concentrate.  Definitely improves the flavor.  Salad is best eaten the day it is prepared as the dressing tends to \"break down\" and lose it's zip over time.  Note:  Try serving this as a dip with tortilla chips ~ Wonderful!",
