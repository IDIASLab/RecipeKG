I added a little white wine and lemon juice to the sauce (while it was simmering) to great effect.  The lemon juice gave the sauce a little pizzazz.  The overall effect was a sauce that had many distinct flavors without being overpowering.  Next time I might add some more clams -- possibly whole clams.  This quality pasta recipe promises to be a regular at our dinner table.",

However after reading some of the past reviews, this is how I prepared the dish:\r\nI used 1 tbls fresh parsley and 1 tbls fresh basil.  I prepared the sauce as directed by using 1/2 of the butter suggested and adding some white wine and a little fresh squeezed lemon juice.  I sauted some mushrooms on the side with the remaining half of butter and added some italian seasonings.  Half way through the simmering process of the sauce, I added a dash of red pepper flakes (will add just a tad more the next time I make this) with the sauted mushrooms.  I tossed all with a garlic and parsley flavored linguini cooked al dante.  This was very, very good and very easy.  I will make it again.",

I reduced the olive oil to just a few tablespoons and used it to saute the garlic with a little added minced onion. I also added 1/2 cup each of white wine and heavy cream. The dish came out beautifully but the sauce was even better the next two days for leftovers (became more creamy). Make sure to add the pasta to the sauce and blend before serving don't pour the sauce over the noodles. Easy inexpensive and a crowd pleaser!",

Made  as stated as far as ingredients but I did add an extra can of clams and I did use chopped clams.  Since everyone fought over the clams, I will put in 4 cans next time.  I also added six cloves of garlic (per our taste).  I did have a little bit of noodles leftover but there was nothing else leftover.  Served with asiago garlic bread and it was perfect for sopping up the sauce.  Thanks so much Peg.  Great meal and quick to make!",
