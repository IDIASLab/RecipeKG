I think that would be out of this world! All in all if you're a fan of zucchini bread/cake this is definitely worth trying!

The coconut flavor is subtle but present though the icing makes them a little too sweet and distracts from the yummy flavors.

You would most likely eat 2-3 times that for a normal size serving.",
