I don't ever remember seeing the two blended together in a blender though not even at the ice cream shops. The combination is so delicious!",

Using a quality vanilla bean icecream takes it over the top as well. For those of you in the Montreal Canada area; try making a cooler with Spruce Beer and French vanilla icecream; that will get your taste buds singing as well.",
