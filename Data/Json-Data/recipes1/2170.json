I think it is from the large amounts of baking powder and baking soda the recipe calls for. I am going to try to use less next time and see how they turn out. Also the bars are really very much more like cake. They were hard to pick up and eat with your hands when cut in squares. The frosting is really yummy too but needed more milk. Overall I would make them again with a few adjustments. Everyone in my family liked them.",

I do make quite a few changes though: 1) teaspoons of baking powder/soda not Tablespoons as others have mentioned 2) I almost halve the sugar and no one notices. Plus I usually go 50/50 on white and brown 3) I substitute a cup of applesauce (no sugar added) for the oil 4) I like more cream cheese in my frosting so I usually do about 6oz cream cheese 6Tbsp butter and powdered sugar to taste which is probably 1.5 to 2 cups My changes make it a little more dense of a cake but no one seems to notice and they are always a hit!",

For frosting used 6 oz or so cream cheese mixed with enough powdered sugar to sweeten it up a bit and then spread thin layer over top. Got great reviews from people at the party-- including that it was nice they weren't overly sweet.
