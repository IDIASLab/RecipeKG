Typically johnny cake is cooked as a pancake but I was OK with baking and cutting it into squares. I cut back on the milk a little and added some orange juice but even with the orange zest I would have liked more orange flavor. This was OK served it with butter and maple syrup for breakfast but not sure I like it well enough to make again.",
