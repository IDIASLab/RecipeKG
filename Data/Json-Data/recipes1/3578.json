I wanted to cut some of the cooking time so I browned the meat most of the way first which may have contributed to my soup being less like \"mush\". I also upped the celery and added some diced carrots. I only used 1.5 lbs of ground beef and it was EXTREMELY hearty. I can't imagine using a full 2. I think the other user may've had problems because I'm pretty sure the pot is supposed to be covered for most of that simmering otherwise you will definitely cook off all the liquid. I used all vegetable juice and no plain tomato juice. Also added some worcestershire which I thought gave it a nice kick. Nice for cold weather with grilled cheese sandwiches (mozarella went very nicely)",
