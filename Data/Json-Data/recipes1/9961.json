My 3 sisters and I have been working on a good recipe for cashew chicken after eating it weekly for 15 years or so I miss it and have to travel home to get it at least once a year.  And Mexican Villa too.  haha We were using way too much oyster sauce yours is right on.  You would think people would realize it is supposed to be salty hence the 8 b. cubes, soy sauce and oyster sauce.  Thanks again.",
