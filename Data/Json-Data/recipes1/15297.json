They are very rich but delish. It is: 1 cup sugar, 2/3 cup margarine, 1 cup light Karo corn syrup, 1 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, 8-9 cups cornflakes, 12 oz. peanut butter chips and 12 oz. chocolate chips. Using a large pot, mix sugar, marg, and syrup over med. heat just until it comes to a boil. Remove from heat and add peanut butter, van, and corn flakes. Mix well. Press into 13x9 greased pan. Cool. Melt peanut butter and choc chips together in microwave until melted and spread on top of corn flakes. Keep in frigerator. So fast and easy!",

One important thing:  Cut these in the pan while they're still warm!!!!  You'll never get the knife through them when they cool off.  They're still soft enough to chew, but very hard to cut!  I'm glad I cut them beforehand!!!!!",

You could also use creamy or crunchy peanut butter. The batch we made we didn't have any peanut butter chips for the topping so we used 2 cups milk chocolate chips. I think it was peanuty enough anyway! I like that you can vary it so many ways. I bet it would be even chewier with thinner cereal like flakes or good with rice krispies too. It's good still warm but chewier when room temperature. I suggest cutting when still a little warm because cutting it cold was hard. The kids make this every time...it is so easy!",
