All the other cranberry sauce recipes on here call for 1C as well so it's not as alarming as one may think. Otherwise it is WAY too tart. Know that when they say the cranberries will POP...they literally mean pop so it may be best to not wear white or stand so close to the pot;) Otherwise this was delicious and a nice twist to the normal cranberry sauce. I've got to admit that my husband thought there was too much cinnamon but he is one of those people who are sensitive to seasonings (loves them but hates when one overwhelms a recipe). Personally I thought it was perfect!!!",
