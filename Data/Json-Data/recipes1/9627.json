The meat can be prepared ahead of time too.  But toss in the dressing, chips and meat just before serving and you'll have a much better salad.  I personally left out the onions & peppers and used Catalina dressing instead.  It's a tasty salad if done right!",

The only changes that I made to this salad is that I used light/low fat Nacho Cheese Doritos and reduced fat cheese \u2013 you can\u2019t tell the difference at all when it is all mixed together!  I also used Western dressing, it tastes really good.  The actual recipe states to refrigerate overnight \u2013 DO NOT do this because it will get soggy.  Since I can\u2019t eat the whole salad at once I chop up all the ingredients and keep in separate baggies and when you are ready to eat just throw everything into your salad dish (I usually heat up the taco meat in the microwave for a minute) and you are ready to eat.
