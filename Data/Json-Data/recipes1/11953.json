It came out very well. 1/2 pound bacon 1/2 pound extra sharp cheddar cheese 2 Tablespoons sliced green onions 1 cup fat-free sour cream 2 teaspoons powdered garlic 1 teaspoon powdered onion 1 teaspoon ground black pepper I cooked the bacon very slowly to render as much fat as possible. I added the sliced green onions during the last few minutes of cooking the bacon to soften them a bit. I cubed the cheddar cheese. I put all the ingredients in the food processor and processed for several minutes adding a few drops of milk to make a smooth paste. You could also substitute some of the sour cream or mayonnaise with soft tofu.",
