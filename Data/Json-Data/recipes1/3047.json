The only thing I do differently is air dry the bread for a few days on cookie sheets - not a few hours (turning several times to make sure both sides dry out completely). The bread is nice and dried out and the dressing does not get soggy. I also double the recipe using two loaves of bread (my family loves the leftovers on top of their turkey sandwiches). Because I double the recipe, I bake this in a roasting pan (and use a little cooking spray on the pan to ease cleanup). When you're making this, add a little broth at a time and stop when it seems right for your taste (if it's too dry then add more, but if it's nice and moist then stop). I have made this with poultry seasoning and I have also made it with sage - they are both very, very good and there is really not a huge difference in taste, so it's just personal preference. I have made several types of dressings and stuffings but always come back to this family favorite.",

I now add 2 Granny Smith apples - peeled, chopped and sauteed with the onion and celery; 1 cup chopped walnuts; and for a meat variety I fry up 1 pkg. of ground Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage with sage, drain fat, then add the sausage to the bread crumbs before adding broth.  The vegetables, apples and sausage will moisten the bread somewhat.  For beginners, add broth slowly while mixing the stuffing so bread does not become too wet or soggy. I usually use less than 1 can of chicken broth. (You can add any leftover broth to your gravy.) Family and friends devour this stuffing! Grandkids love it! UPDATE Nov.2008: I now include 1 small 6 oz. bag of craisins\nwith the above ingredients. Delicious.",

I was told by Grandma and Dad to add \"enough broth to make it moist\" or add 'a dash at a time until it tastes \"right\".'  I like to measure and this recipe makes it turn out perfectly.  Even Dad said it was better than his.\nTip - toast the bread very lightly, combine the night before with a little less broth and poultry seasoning than it calls for.  In the morning, toss it again and taste it.  Add a drizzle more broth if it is dry or a dash more poultry seasoning if needed. (the seasoning gets stronger as it sits overnight so don't overdo it) Also, the intensity of the seasoning depends on how old it is. Seasonings weaken over time. \nI suggest baking it covered in a casserole and uncovering it with about 15 min to go so it is a little browned and crisp on top.  And cut the onion and celery very fine.  That is key.  Enjoy.",
