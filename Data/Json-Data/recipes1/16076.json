I should have ground it myself because it left a really gritty texture - no fault of the recipe, but be sure to use a very find grind. The only stumper here was the amount of noodles to use.  \"2 cups\" is a rather odd way to measure out dry vermicelli. I ended up using one 3.5oz (100g) package, and once softened, it was a little more than 2 cups. I ended up drizzling a little extra soy sauce at the end. I've seen recipes use broth instead of water, so I might try that next time. This makes 4 small servings. By the way, if you aren't used to Sichuan pepper, it does have a numbing effect.",
