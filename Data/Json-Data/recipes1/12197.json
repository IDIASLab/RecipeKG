The 1/4 cup sugar isn't enough to really sweeten the tea it just cuts the bite. I used the juice of frozen crushed raspberries and that wasn't overly sweet either. I used Club Soda in place of carbonated water because its what I had on hand. The fizz of the soda was diluted by the tea leaving the tea with just a little tingle but no sparkle bubbles or fizzes. All in all its a very tasty iced tea for those who don't care for the cloyingly sweet kind.Its unlike any of the raspberry teas I have had in the past. Thanks for sharing Scott!",
