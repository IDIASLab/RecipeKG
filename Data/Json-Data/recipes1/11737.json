Also do not cover it as the juices won't evaporate and therefore it will be really watery when you get ready to serve it. Also this isn't really ideal for a vegetarian as it is really difficult to call a serving of this a meal it's more of a side dish. With that being said it was simple to make and was tastey. I just needed to bake it again without it being covered so that I could get rid of some juices. It really did taste great. In the future if I make it I'll make it with rice on the bottom.",
