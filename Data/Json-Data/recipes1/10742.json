If the creator made a note about using part heavy cream, then my banana pudding would come out looking 5 times thicker and it would not take 3 hours to just be less thin.\n\nNext time, I will (and to everyone else), use at least 1/4 of the requested milk indgredient amount(ex: reciepe ask for 1 cup of milk, instead...use 3/4 of milk and 1/4 of heavy cream).",

If your pudding is really runny when you remove it from the pan, it will also be runny when you serve it.

I \"know\" that you should get the pudding thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and when you run your finger down it you can tell it has thickened up.  What tripped me up in this recipe is the statement \"when mixture begins to thicken\" indicating at the beginning of the thickening process you take the pudding off the burner.  If you follow the directions and do that you will have runny pudding like so many folks with this recipe including myself had.  I thought it might thicken up when I refrigerated it, but that is not the case.  Cook this pudding until it is thickened than take it off the burner and you should be ok.  The flavor was lovely and I think I would make it again, but next time using my skills and knowledge as a cook and not depending on a recipe that has a slight flaw that will produce a desert that isn't \"right\"",

I upped the vanilla, used three bananas, only egg whites, and almost a whole box of vanilla wafers, but I followed everything else as written.  Had no problems with runniness, stickiness, etc.  I think the trick may be to stir (constantly) with a whisk so that air gets in to the pudding, preventing lumps and allowing it to cool more evenly.  I would agree that if you plan to get 18 servings out of this, they will be tiny.  I really couldn't see any more than 12.",
