I guess I don't know how to roast meat because mine just turned out dry and did not fall apart.  I made this recipe a second time for our fourth of July family reunion picnic and I cooked the meat with some beef broth and onions in my crock pot for four hours on high until the meat fell apart, then I added the sauce.  I let it sit in the refrigerator overnight (this sauce tastes best when you let it sit a few days).  The next morning I put it in a 350 degree oven for about an hour and all I can say is - WOW!!!!!",

Made sauce as directed found it to be enough for 3 lbs of beef. However I added a bit extra beef broth to increase sauce amount. Would definitly double the sauce recipe if I used more meat. used beef broth instead of water to fill up the chili sauce jar... very good! I give the sauce five stars but think a slow cooker is best for meat that is easy to shred. I think I will use this on my pulled pork as well can't wait to see what the leftovers taste like tonight!",
