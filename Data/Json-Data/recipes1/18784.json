I'm glad I took a chance on this simple little one review dish!",

To jazz it up a little, added a small, diced red onion to the sausage and potatos, then added a chopped green pepper, a crushed clove of garlic, subbing a diced jalepeno for the chiles, plus about a half cup of frozen corn.  One cup of cheese was just right to finish it off.  Really good meal.",
