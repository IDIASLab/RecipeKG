First instead of regular onions I used green onions which gave a more asian flavor and instead of frying I placed on a cookie sheet sprayed with light cooking spray and then sprayed the wontons with the cooking spray liberally. Bake in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes or until golden and crispy. We also had someone bring a pineapple cream dip and that went perfect with these babies! Yummy! I have already been asked to make them for our next get together.",

My biggest suggestion is watch the lil buggers when you're frying them up. They go from brown to burnt in the blink of an eye. The only wasabi sauce I could find at the store was a horseradish wasabi. It was WAY too hot for me but the heat-lovers at our dinner party loved it.... as they wiped the tears from their eyes and blew their noses.;)",
