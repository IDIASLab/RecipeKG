I get about 24 large rolls from this yield.  The dough looks a little sticky at first, but if you keep a healthy amount of flour close and keep adding as needed through the 5 minute knead, it firms up beautifully.  Another reviewer suggested the cream cheese frosting, and I won't ice them with anything else...it really makes them bakery quality.  To repeat the posted frosting recipe, it's : 1/2 cup butter, softened 8 ounces cream cheese 4 cups confectioners' sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract Directions 1 Beat softened butter and cream cheese until well blended. 2 Add powdered sugar and vanilla. Beat until creamy. Makes 2 Cups. \r\n",

The author just needs to adjust the amount of suggested flour! (or reduce the amount of water), depending on the quantity of rolls you want. Instead of the 6 c., add 9 c all-purpose flour, and 1 c. more to your desired consistency. The important thing to remember, is NOT to add additional flour after the first rise (dough should be slightly sticky for the light and fluffy part), as flour added in later doesn't mix in well and the result is dry and 'floury'.  Also to knead and even 'throw' the dough down on the counter repeatedy, until dough is elastic.  Dough took 2 hours to rise, so there is no way it can rise double in 45 minutes.  A final recommendation is to bake the rolls only 20 minutes! and anything further creates a dried out pastry that won't be light and fluffy.",
