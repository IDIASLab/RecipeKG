I actually did something a little different that turned out REALLY well: I used a glass ungreased 9 X13 baking pan and I added 2 cups of raw rice and 2-and-a-half cups of water to the bottom of the pan. I stirred the rice to make sure it soaked the water in well then I put the chicken on top of the rice/water mix and poured the sauce over that. I baked it covered with tin foil for 20 minutes @ 400F then I removed the tin foil and baked for 30 or so minutes uncovered. The rice cooks thoroughly and easily on its own absorbing the flavorful sauce and the chicken is very moist and tender with a coating of the sweet and sour. I think next time I might add a little pineapple before I pour on the sauce because I love pineapple.",

Definately will add this to my rotation. My husband loved it!",
