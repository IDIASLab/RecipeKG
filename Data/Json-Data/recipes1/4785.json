A batch of about 7 drumstucks were marinated in a mixture of 1 tbsp fish sauce,  1 tsp salt, 1 tsp white pepper, and 8 cloves of garlic for 30 minutes. The chicken was then fried in vegetable oil in a wok maintained as close as possible to 350 degrees for about 10 minutes. I also substituted 4 thai chili peppers instead of jalapenos. The garlic sauce is the pefect complement. My wife's family is from Phuket and shes tells me that the sauce reminds her of the taste she used to encounter  at the street vendors waiting outside her school when she was a kid. Awesome recipe!",

I used the sauce as a marinade overnight and then shook the marinade off of the wings. I then placed them on a jelly roll pan sprayed with non-stick spray and baked them at 450F until they had a nice color. I had reserved the marinade; I boiled it down to a semi-thick glace and spooned it over the wings. I then garnished with extra chiles and served with the 'Satay Sauce' (adding garlic and ginger) found on this site. SUPER good but get your mileage out of the sauce by marinading first.",

                "reviewBody": "I had bought a bag of frozen wings by mistake so decided to use them in a recipe that didn't need to be fried and this fit the bill (or so I thought). On the advice of other reviewers I cut the fish sauce to 1/4 and also cut down on the sugar...using half brown and half white. I had to read the amount of garlic twice(and I am a garlic lover) 1/3 CUP of crushed garlic seemed like a bit much but I proceeded. That pretty much equals a whole bulb of garlic once you get it crushed. I was hesitant to sautee that much garlic in oil for fear of getting too brown and tasting bitter. I lightly sauteed it in some wok oil to add a bit of sesame flavor to the dish. I used 2 whole jalepenos with the seeds in as I like heat. When I tasted the sauce it was very overpowering with garlic and not pleasant tasting garlic at that. I added about a tsp. of sesame oil for flavor and even though that helped it still was too sweet I could taste the fish sauce and that overpowering garlic flavor was too much. I put the sauce on the wings about the last 10 min. of baking to try to mellow the flavor along with some sesame seeds on top to toast. It was a little better after being in the oven but there was no way I could have stood that sauce to just pour over at the end.",
