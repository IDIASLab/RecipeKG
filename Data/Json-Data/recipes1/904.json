I baked on wax paper for 12 min but my cookies were bigger than 1\" balls (I just dropped 2\" blobs on the cookie sheet.) The batter was just right the cookie held together well and was a little chewy. Not sure where the crisp part came in??",

I forgot to flatten my test batch before they went in the oven but it worked out great so I didn't do it to the rest. I ended up with nearly 48 cookies! These freeze well they still taste great.",
