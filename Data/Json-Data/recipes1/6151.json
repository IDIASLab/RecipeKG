I also used Italian style canned diced tomatoes with the juice.  I bought julienne carrots in the bag (easy) and used a lot more garlic.  I serve it over Roasted Garlic and Olive Oil Couscous that has been seasoned with the two McCormick seasonings above.  I absolutely love this dish!  Just wonderful!!",
