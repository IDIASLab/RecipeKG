In doing so, I skipped the food processor and coarse chopped the artichoke hearts by hand and used a garlic press for the garlic...it was fairly simple...took a whole 5 minutes extra.  Then I mixed the ingredients together right in the baking dish.  I also used marinated artichoke hearts since the recipe did not specify and it turned out great.  I did change the oven temperature to 350 and baked for 20 minutes because I wanted a slower cooking to help the flavors mingle together.  It turned out very flavorful and creamy...not greasy at all.  Great recipe!  P.S. I used FRESH grated parmesan cheese...not the salt licks in a green can!",
