                "reviewBody": "After reading some of the other reviews/suggestions here is my take. Basic soup was good but I added more chopped garlic and roasted garlic seasoning to the broccoli. I noticed the flour/butter mixture did tend to clump a little but I solved that by tossing it back in the blender with a drop or two of chicken stock and smoothing it down (and yes being from south Louisiana I do know how to make a roux!). Also I used whole wheat flour just cause I like the extra \"goose\" of flavor and texture it gives a roux - one of my cooking tricks that I usually don't reveal:-). Finally to add a little more body to the soup I sauteed a handful of chopped mushrooms in butter roasted garlic seasoning and another splash of chicken stock. After adding the sauteed mushrooms to the soup I cooked it about 10 minutes more over a low heat and served that puppy up. The shrooms thickened it up just right and I suspect it'll taste even better tomorrow after the flavors blend a little more. Bon appetit y'all!",

YUM YUM!!The only problem I had preparing it was the fact that I think the recipe calls for too little butter with the amount of flour that the recipe uses. It just turned into a big pasty mess. I've made the recipe numerous times and I now add a touch more butter to it (adds a little fat to the recipe but not enough to worry about) and it comes out perfect. Also it sounds like a strange combination but I've also added chicken to it on occasion to make it a one-bowl dinner on those lazy days. The best compliment I can think of to give this recipe is that my mother loved it. And if you know my mother she doesn't like anything!",
