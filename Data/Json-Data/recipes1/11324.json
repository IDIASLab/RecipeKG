We like this recipe best with chopped shrimp but I have also used chicken.  I use frozen peas but this is a very versatile dish and you could use almost anything you like in it.

I did not have bacon so I just fried up 2 pieces of bologna and cut it up  (it worked fine).  I cooked the rice in chicken broth to give it flavor.  I used three eggs as suggested and it turned out fine for me.  I added a few drops of sesame oil, a 1/2 teaspoon of fish sauce, shredded carrots, about a cup of peas, 3 green onions, a little more soy sauce than stated and a little more salt and pepper.  I also added white pepper as well. After frying everything until heated through, I gave it a taste and it was to die for.  I ended up eating this fried rice instead of the bagged broccoli and beef!  My husband and three kids thought it was way better.  I won't buy those bags anymore.  This was so easy and tasted much better!  Many thanks.",

I add a large clove of GARLIC pressed or minced to the fat and cook it a few seconds just before adding the rice.
