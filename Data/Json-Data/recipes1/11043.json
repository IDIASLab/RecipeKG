When using ranch packages the sooner you mix cook and eat...the more you \"taste\" the ranch. The longer it has to blend into the rest of the ingredients the more it'll taste like a traditional chicken jerusalem. I make mine in the morning (mix ingredients on stovetop then onto the chicken) & cook when husband comes home (only needs 45 minutes)! With that said it is wise to only use half a package of ranch. Cutting down the white wine to 1C makes it perfect for us. While quality of the wine makes a difference I use dirt cheap and have wonderful results. It's great to have a recipe you can put together so quickly and make all in one casserole dish! Perfect for those days you're very busy or not wanting to make a big fuss over dinner. The chicken comes out so super tender! Great with stuffing and salad or sometimes we serve with diced potatoes and there's plenty of sauce to serve it over pasta and rice! Another recipe that is very similar and quick (and not as powerful) is: Wine Sauce Chicken from this site! I prefer that one and my husband prefers this one! So they're both keepers!",

I made the sauce subbing italian dressing mix for the ranch mix and decreased the wine by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup chicken broth. I added a little of the sauce mix to 1 1/2 cup shredded chicken just until moist then also stirred in about 1/2 cup mozzerella. I used this mixture to stuff pasta shells and poured the remaining sauce over everything. I baked at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes. It was fabulous. I served it for a birthday party and even the pickiest eater went back for seconds. This is definately a favorite.",

I think it would be delicious served over shrimp or lobster. I changed a few things: 1 cup of white cooking wine a little less cream cheese (low fat) half a pack of ranch soup mix and 2 cloves of garlic blended into the sauce. I also used golden mushroom soup which gave it a gorgeous golden hue. So good and so easy- and i'm only 14! My parents loved it and i will make this so many more times! Serve with good crusty bread to soak up the sauce. Definitely the best thing you might ever make!",
