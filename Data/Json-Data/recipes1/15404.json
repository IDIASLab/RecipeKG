My husband loves spicier food so for him I put in more seasoning to make the meat pop. You can make it ahead of time; just refrigerate covered for up to 3 hours and then increase baking time to 25 to 30 minutes.",

After draining it, I mixed the tomato paste, all  the seasonings (which I did not measure) the parmesan cheese (more than called for) and the cottage cheese (which I did not cream). I did not add the egg only because I forgot and after tasting the meat mixture I did not think it needed it since I wasn't layering it. I thought it tasted like pizza not lasagna. Pizza or lasagna, either way we loved it and I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe.",
