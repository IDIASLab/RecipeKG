I followed the advice of a previous reviewers who suggested you leave the nuts in the syrup a minute or two longer and not bother with the slotted spoon; just dump the whole batch of nuts onto the parchment paper lined baking sheet. Cool slightly separate the nuts a bit and put them into a plastic ziploc bag containing the 1 cup of turbinado sugar 1 tsp sea salt 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp cayenne. Of course you can adjust the amounts to taste depending on the sweet-salty-spicy ratio you prefer. Shake them up well to coat and pour them onto a fresh piece of parchment on the baking sheet. Separate any clumps and let cool. Quick easy and tasty!",

Easy to make however I would caution that instead of using a slotted spoon to fish out the nuts dump the whole thing on the parchment then while after cooling slightly but still warm dump it in the plastic bag with the sugar then back to the cookie sheet lines with fresh parchment. That way you can break up any big clumps and sprinkle it lightly with sea salt while it cools. That makes it 5 stars and easier to make as you are not fishing around for the nuts that way.",
