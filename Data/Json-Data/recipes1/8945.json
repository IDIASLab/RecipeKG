The secret is to beat each of the three eggs one at a time for three minutes each. The texture of the final product is much better and bakes lighter. Bake at 350 degrees for 28 minutes only, even if they don't look done. Also, I use Crisco instead of butter and one 1 pound box of LIGHT BROWN sugar. When they are at room temp, they are very gooey inside. Good luck! I think if you use my tips, you too will be a congo square Queen like me! lol",

The only difference i see is that we use a 350\u00ba oven and you have to carefully watch the time and sometimes take out 5 minutes early depending on your oven. They can be very gooey or very cakey.. my family likes them gooeier... also we just tried making them with the splenda brown sugar blend and they came out just as good but with no sugar for the diabetics in our family.
