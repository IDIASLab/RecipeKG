They are chocolately and spicey and keep for quite a while and the older they get the better they taste! Perfect for Christmas cookies. The kind I get normally have a chocolate icing but this one is good too. The only recommendation I have it to refrigerate the dough for about 30 minutes before rolling it out to make the process easier.",
