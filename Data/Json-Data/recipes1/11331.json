I added the chopped onions directly to the mashed potato mix to eliminate the butter. I used fat free Italian dressing in place of the ranch, and used mrs. dash's garlic and herb seasoning (2 Teaspoons)  in the place of salt and pepper. I also sprayed the pan with a fat free olive oil cooking spray so I didn't need to rub the outside of the potato with oil. I also sprinkled the top with fat reduced pamersan cheese. VERY TASTY!!! Even my kids ate this (all 8 of them) and didn't realize it was fat reduced. Served it with grilled salmon fillets.  Great base recipe for me to play with. Thank you Hallie.",

Based on the previous reviews, I added garlic, half a cup of shredded colby jack cheese and used Hidden Valley Ranch dressing with Bacon to enhance the flavor. Also, to save time I didn't cook the onions, just mixed them with the rest of the filling ingredients before stuffing and baking the potates. This probably made the onion flavor stronger than the original recipe but if you like onion you'll really like the taste.",

I added lots of garlic to sautee with the onions and instead of ranch dressing I used a few tbsp's of olive oil (not extra virgin which tends to get bitter when you cook it) plus some parsley, a small amount of cheddar and parmesan cheese and 4 slices (for two potatoes) of cooked turkey bacon. Then I seasoned it with Emeril's Essence seasoning (lots!) and sprinkled a bit of sea salt on the outside of the spuds while they cooked. It was so good I ate it two nights in a row ;) Thank you.",

It was time consuming but really worth the effort. They were tasty. Oh I also cut the recipe in half. We ate these as our main course and were both stuffed ourselves!",

I also oiled the potatoes and rolled them lightly in salt then wrapped them in aluminumn before putting them in the oven for the first time. These were terrific!",

I did have huge potatoes and did increase the recipe to 5 servings for the 4 potatoes to compensate but maybe I should have increased it by more. Here's a tip on getting the potato out of the skin without destroying it: After you cut the tops off cut down into the potato all the way around the top angling a little so get close to the skin without puncturing it. Then score that oval cut several times aross the middle. You can then scoop it out in sections. I didn't tear a single one. Just wish they had tasted better.",
