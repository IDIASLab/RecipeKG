He wanted to bring it to a boil and then almost shut the heat off.  I thought it would be hot enough. Our compromise was to turn the heat to medium for about 20 minutes.  49 out of the 50 clams opened.  I was shocked to see how much liquor they make.  I thought the small amount of wine wouldn't be enough.\nThey were great.  Definitely have a lot of crusty bread on hand.  Linguine or some other pasta is great.  My kids were so brave about trying them.  I can't wait to make it again.  We added some fresh lemon after they were cooked and it really brought out the flavor. Delicious!\nOh, and scrub the clams really well.  I got a lot of sand and gunk off them.\nTHANKS for a great recipe.",
