I also added one egg to the coconut macadamia mixture to tame any oversweet claims in other reviews. The second baking took about 35 minutes. Had a very faint coffee flavor and an overall buttery chewy richness that is addictive. I will be making these for my island ohana over & over. ONO! Many mahalos for sharing!",
