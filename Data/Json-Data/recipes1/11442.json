A nice variation is to saute 1 tablespoon of finely minced garlic and parsley (fresh or dried) in some olive oil (appx. 1 tablespoon), then add to the mixture.  The oil adds moistness and the garlic adds a fantastic flavor and aroma, just like in the restaurants.  I've added dill, garlic powder, garlic salt, paprika, oinion powder, whatever I have on hand for more flavor.  And definitely serve with garlic aioli or garlic mayonaise.  (Mayo - 1/2 cup mayonaise, 1 garlic clove minced, dash of paprika and lemon juice.)  Serve a small dollop on top and you're dining in style.  My kids love this too.  Nice fpr small ones just learning to chew since they can mash this easily in their mouths.  Nice company dinner too!",
