I browned the pork chops in a skillet and also added a bit of salt, sage, celery seed, thyme, and rosemary to the stuffing mix.

Also added about 2 or 3 tablespoons of chicken broth to the soup just to make it easier to pour over the chops. Very, very good.  Thanks rainy918. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because it really needed the herbs and chicken broth.",
