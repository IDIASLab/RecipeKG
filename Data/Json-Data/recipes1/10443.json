When it cooled the edges tore off but I made it look alright by adding a whipped cream edge and strawberry sauce on top.

I am almost commanded to make this for any work function now they liked it that much. If I were single I believe I could woo women with the power of this cheesecake alone. It's that good. A few prep notes--I have two \"9 inch\" springform pans one is slightly larger--use a slightly larger pan this fills it quite well. Also I have found it best to refrigerate this overnight before serving it. The texture is better after being completely cooled. I also like to drizzle chocolate ganache on the top. Once when the top was a little over done I covered it in ganache just as or maybe even MORE yummy!",

If you take a cookie sheet and fill it with water it provides enough humidity to keep it from cracking. Cook it for the first 20 minutes on the 375 listed, but after 20 minutes turn it down to 325. It will burn on top if you cook it for a full hour on 375. Make sure to let it cool in the oven or else it will not come out flat on top. (I personally like to double the amaretto.)",
