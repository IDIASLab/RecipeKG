The recipe calls to use an 8 inch dish, but that's not right.  The first time I made this, I used a 9 inch deep dish, and it worked beautifully. The second time, I used a regular 9 inch plate, and it overflowed just a bit, so go with the 9\" deep dish.  The only thing I changed was to use cinnamon instead of nutmeg, because that was all I had.  One thing worth mentioning... After the initial 15 min. bake time, you really have to put foil around the edge of crust.  Also, about 10 min. before it was done, I thought it was getting too brown, so I layed a large piece of foil loosely over the pie.  It worked perfectly!!!  Thank you so much for the recipe.",

This is the perfect sugar cream pie recipe, but it is important to remember that recipes like this can be influenced by weather and other factors.  So, if it doesn't look thick at the end of the baking time, turn down the heat, leave it in the oven a bit longer, and keep a close eye on it so that it thickens up or you'll just have goo.",
