I wasn't sure they would like them (because of the rolled oats) but it was a huge success! I still haven't told them about the oats... I made two small changes to the recipe. After mixing all the ingredients I placed the batter in the fridge to make it easier to form into cookie shapes. For the swirl to work well I put a little of the batter aside and mixed in some cocoa. Once I placed the cookie dough on the cookie sheets I made the swirl on each of them with the separate chocolate mixture. Worked like a charm.",
