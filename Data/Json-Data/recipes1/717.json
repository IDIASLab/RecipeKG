I had to tweak the proportions as well and the cookies took no more than 6 minutes. Due to my limited tins and pans I found out that this combination of ingredients - in any preferred measurements - is an indulgence as well as an invincible go-to for any event. It can make an amazing pie crust on the bottom or if you line the pie tin with wax paper and grease powdered sugar the paper you can flip it onto the top of a pie or cheesecake! or for cookie cake (if you add a bit of baking soda and almost double the chocolate chips it's SO crackly outside and fudgy inside)! I can't imagine this recipe with anything less than Ghirardelli 60% dark or semi-sweet chocolate chips- it's worth the extra dollar over Hershey. I am so excited to add this to my catering platters!",

I ended up with hard little ice-cream scoop-shaped lumps. Crunchy outside and soft inside as advertised though. I may make a second attempt but not really worth the investment in chocolate. Flatenning them with a fork was not an improvement.....rubbery crumbles resulted.",
