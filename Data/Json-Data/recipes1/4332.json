The wontons must be cooked in boiling water separately and then served with chicken stock.  I have made these many times and different variations.  Usually, I will substitute diced shitake mushrooms (soaked for several hours) in place of the shrimp and serve them with campbells chicken broth.  This time, I followed the recipe but also added a bit of wood fungus too (soaked a few hours & sliced finely -- it's also put in hot and sour soup).  I make a big batch and freeze for later.  Frozen wontons make a quick and wonderful meal for those nights you feel like you can only boil water!",

I love that the pork loin is finely chopped instead of using ground pork it gives it a great texture that isn't pastey or chewy like some recipes. Used rice vinegar instead of wine because I had it on hand not sure how much this effected the flavor. Also I would recommend to anyone who wants to try this to either chop the ginger VERY finely or simply grate it. I got the occasional bite of a small chunk of ginger not so good =). Anyway a fantastic wonton recipe that I will use all the time. Btw I accidentally chopped a little more than 1 tsp ginger so I added the remainder to the stock. Wouldn't recommend doing something like that unless you REALLY love ginger. It ended up being a little overpowering and I think I only probably added about 1/4 tsp to it. Edit: if you have complaints about the broth that is not the recipe's flaw: it's mediocre broth. Consider adding some kick with a splash of rice vinegar and a little grated ginger (have invested in a grater since my earlier post what a fantastic tool!)",

The trick to preventing the wontons from becoming a gloppy mess is to cook them in boiling water first then putting them in the broth. I also had some left over bok choy from the stir fry that I was also making so threw that in the soup during the last 2 minutes of cooking. Wonderful!",
