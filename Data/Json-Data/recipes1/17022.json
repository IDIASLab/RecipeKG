When I added to the ice cream it caused tiny little bits of frozen green tea but I liked it like that. Mixed on a frozen marble slab and used Blue Bell Homemade vanilla. I have some red tea powder that makes a fab cup of tea so I'm guessing will also make a yummy red tea ice cream. Fantastic idea thanks!",

The strength of matcha really varies form source to source. And it loses quite a bit of flavor with age. Start a with a little and then add more. Use the purest ice cream for this. If you refreeze the ice cream that has additives you will be disappointed in the final product. It gets foamy and flat especially from all the stirring. This is a great trick for instant green tea ice cream. I usually just want a little bit and it perfect.",

In order to get the Matcha mixed in well with the ice cream it has to be pretty well melted. Then if you re-freeze it it is much harder and you loose a lot of volume. So after much thought I decided to take it back out and put it in a mixer and whip it up again and then re-freeze it. This worked OK -- at least saved me from having to throw away a whole carton of ice cream. Also the Matcha I bought was so strong that the flavor was overwhelming. I had to also buy more ice cream to mix in before whipping it. All in all -- too much bother and not a very satisfactory result.",
