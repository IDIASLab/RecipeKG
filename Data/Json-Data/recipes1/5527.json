It really needed some time to let the flavors blend and mellow otherwise I only tasted a lot of lemon from the cake and it overpowered everything else. By day two it was really smooth light and refreshing and something I think I will make again but now I know to let it chill overnight before serving. Oh and I used 12 oz. Cool Whip and it was almost too much so I don't know why it calls for 16 oz. in the recipe it would be spilling over the sides otherwise.",
