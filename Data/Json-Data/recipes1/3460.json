First of all, save yourself time and don't put aside a cup of the chocolate batter. My brownies were prettier and had more of a marbled look after I spread the pb than it did after adding the cup of chocolate. The chocolate pretty much covered the pb completely.  Also, these needed frosting in my opinion. I used the following recipe for frosting, and this made this a 5 star recipe! I got this from Blondies on this website: 1/4 cup butter softened 1/2 cup peanut butter 1.5 cups  powdered sugar 1/4 cup milk To make the frosting, mix the remaining 1/2 cup of butter and 1 cup peanut butter together in a medium bowl. Mix in the confectioners sugar until smooth, then gradually stir in milk until a spreadable consistency is reached. Serve frosted brownies warm with ice cream. NOW you're talking 5-star!!:-)\nI made these a 2nd time without frosting and they tasted better this time. I didn't put the cup of chocolate on top, and they turned out pretty...I put a couple of spoonfuls of chocolate batter on top, not the whole cup.",

Also I had trouble with the \"swirling\" - I couldn't get the layers to swirl together because I didn't drop chocolate onto the top so it wasn't quite as pretty as I'd hoped. That said the two layers taste great together. I used 8 oz. cream cheese (instead of 6) and had no problems. These brownies taste like 80% chocolate and 20% peanut butter cheesecake in case you're curious about the taste. I will definitely make again!",

I think that letting them cool for a while lets them become a bit fudgier and sweeter-they are really good-trust me I just had one for breakfast.

                "reviewBody": "These are incredible brownies! I used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese for the peanut butter layer, and it worked very well. I also skipped the chocolate chips...in my opinion, they would have made marbling much more difficult, they were unnecessary (the brownies were VERY chocolatey without them) and added extra unnecessary calories :) Those are the only changes I made to the recipe itself. I did make some changes to the assembly of the brownies, though. Instead of saving 1 cup of batter, I saved about 1/3 cup. It was way to thick to marble with, so I added a little milk until it was more like regular brownie batter. I spread the rest of the batter into a foil-lined pan (I use Reynold's Release foil...it works SO well for brownies!) and then spread the peanut butter filling on top. I then placed spoonfuls of reserved batter on top of the peanut butter, making neat rows. I used a clean knife to marble them together, but was careful not to marble so much that the overall look was muddied. I baked it for about 30 minutes or so...until a toothpick inserted halfway to the center came out clean. As written, the brownies would be overbaked and dry. After they cooled in the pan, I lifted the brownies  out of the pan using the foil lining, making cutting much easier. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe...these were a big hit! I'll be making these brownies again!!!",
