I also added fresh sliced mushrooms while sauting the onions and broccoli and added 1/4 cup milk to the eggs to ensure that they would be fluffy.  I had to bake a tad longer than called for BUT every bite was worth the wait!! Thank you Ann! This will become part of our regular breakfast dishes!!",

Its also a recipe that (I think) you could easily add/subtract veggies to taste. My mouth is watering just thinking about it...I plan to make it again this upcoming Saturday morning!

First of all, I microwaved 4 large russet potatoes in a potato bag, then peeled and  cubed them.  In a skillet I added olive oil, the cubed potatoes, about a quarter diced onion, a little diced green and red pepper, salt and pepper, and browned, then put in the casserole dish. Then softened the fresh broccoli and onion in butter and a little salt & pepper. Added the cubed ham, then I doubled the eggs, added a little fat-free milk and salt & pepper, and 1 cup of cheese.  Poured over mixture and put in the refrigerator for 20 hours.  Because of the extra eggs, and being cold, I allowed 60-70 minutes cooking time, until set.  There was no sticking of the potatoes, as some stated, probably because of browning in the olive oil, clean up was a snap! DELICIOUS!! Everyone LOVED it!  Will definitely make again! Thank you!!",

The second time I used two small onions (1 lrge onion would do as well), 2 overflowing cups cubed ham, 4 lrge potatoes (I had used smaller ones before), and 1 extra egg. I also sprinkled some seasoned salt on top of the potatoes before adding the onion broccoli mixture. It was kinda bland the first go around. The second time was perfect and very much more filling. Hubby absolutely loves it. I will probably steal it as a trademark breakfast dish for guests. Thanks for a great recipe.",
