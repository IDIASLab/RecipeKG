I used about 1/4 cup of sugar with this recipe and it was still sour. The lemon overpowered the taste of the apples and you really rely on the apples for all of the sweetness in this pie. Although I did get some nice comments nobody came back for seconds. The next time I use this recipe I'll either cut the lemon in half and add 1/4 cup of sugar (or and equivelence of sugar substitute) or try JSONEAL's idea of 1Tbsp OJ instead of lemon juice.",
