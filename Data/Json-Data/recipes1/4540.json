This recipe Extremely Easy to make... like extremely easy... which is a good thing for me. A lot of times recipes like this are way too complicated... This took about 15 minutes to prepare with the kids getting in the way and 45 min to bake and about an hour to cool at room tempature.    Mine didn't really look like the picture though.. I know some people said it looks 'ugly' beucase of the color, yes, it is ugly, but to me it looks like a pumpkin pie just a little on the darker side.  If you like cinnamon you will like this... and if you are not a HUGE cinnamon fan.. I still think you might like it.. I am not huge on cinnamon, but I will definately make this again.",

When you make it the \"batter\" will be very thin almost like milkey. and when you take it out of the oven it will giggle. Just let it cool for 30 minutes Don't worry though. it will be great. And for the crust i recomend using the \"buttery crunch crust\" recipe on this site. It went GREAT together. Try this it is awsome with a cup of coffee the next morning.",

The pie was absolutely delicious!! It had the perfect custard texture that I was hoping for.",

If you look up that one you'll see what I mean. Its often made with a dusting of nutmeg on top although I prefer cinnamon. Around here its not an oddity its a classic often found on restaurant menus & well worth a try but be warned its wonderfully rich!",
