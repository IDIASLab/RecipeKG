What I want to point out is that this can really be a one-dish meal.  It's not necessary to cook everything atop the stove and then transfer to a baking dish for the oven.  I simply throw all the ingredients together in a baking dish, then toss it in the oven.  After about half an hour, I stir well, then let it go for another half hour or so.  The grits are cooked to perfection, and I just made a very easy, quick meal!  My family loves it, so on occasion, I throw it together for dinner.  The ease of it all makes me happy, and they're happy 'cause they like it so much!",

Last year we (30 of us) did a side by side comparison at Easter with the original recipe and a reduced fat version. I used this recipe and made it with half the amount of butter and light processed cheese and everyone liked the lower fat version better than the original. Just an option. It is also wonderful made with grated sharp cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese.  Great recipe Mollie!",

As you've probably guessed my huband is \"a grits man\". Anyway to make a long story short I felt it was my duty to \"one up\" Lulu's. So I printed out this recipe and made it for my husband upon his return home. BAM! These are now \"THE BEST GRITS MY HUSBAND HAS EVER HAD IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE\". Try them! They are FAB.

Per previous reviews I reduced the amount of butter-in fact I used \"I Can't Believe It's Butter\" to reduce fat content. I used  less process cheese per other reviews and used Light Velveeta.  I did not add hot sauce because my friend does not like spicy.  I omitted the additional salt per other reviews. I cooked the grits in a pot on the stove and then mixed in all additional ingredients. I tempered the eggs (mixed some of hot grits into beaten eggs) before adding to the entire mix so as not to have scrambled eggs! Per another reviewer I baked in the removable crock pottery for a little less than an hour til top was golden.  Then transported in crock pot to destination and kept on warm setting. It was a hit! So if you need to take this dish to another location using a crock pot is the perfect solution. Lots of compliments. Thanks for the recipe and all the wonderful review suggestions!!",

The stoneware part of my crock pot comes out so to make sure they would be hot for the brunch I cooked them in the stoneware part of my crockpot in the oven then put the stoneware in the warming part took the whole thing to work plugged it in and put on keep warm setting. This is a VERY RICH recipe. Don't even want to add up the fat grams but was very good. I'll definitely make this again. Next time I'll use light Velveta and a low fat margarine. Thank you Mollie.",
