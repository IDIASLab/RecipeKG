I've found that dusting the top of quick breads with a little bit of sugar is an excellent substitute for copious amounts of sugar in the batter plus it give the bread a great crusty top. Like another reviewer I substituted applesauce for all of the oil and it turned out great. I would recommend both greasing and flouring the pans though. Also I would add about one teaspoon extra cinnamon. My loaves cooked in one hour.",
