It's been adjusted over time - like switching to bisquick when it became available - but other than one ingredient left out, and one ingredient used completely rather than discarded, it's the same. We've never used the cheese in ours, which is the one removed ingredient, but I learned this recipe from Mom aaaaages ago. We actually mix the grilled onion bits into the mix, too - that's the ingredient competely used, rather than discarded -  and we use a bisquick-type mix instead of the flour, etc., but it's basically the same dish.  We LOVE to use leftover boiled or baked potatoes, and just hash them into the rest of the already mixed batter & then mix in the onion, too. Cook just as described in here, and they're usually eaten around here as soon as they're cool enough to handle, LOL!  \n\nOh, and the bacon bits end up in salads, later, too!",
