I prepared these mushrooms for Valentine's dinner, and my boyfriend LOVED them. He's not an onion fan though, so I omitted them completely and they were still good! I added garlic powder to the sauteing mushrooms for extra flavor (my kitchen never smelled so good!) I used regular white button mushrooms (because college students need to get the best deals they can!) and used a melon baller to scoop out the insides, which made it soooo easy. Like many others, I used extra mushrooms instead of the stems, but since I was short on time and they were on sale, I used pre-sliced mushrooms for the filling, which cut down on my chopping time. I would also recommend using a mini chopper to chop up the bacon. My boyfriend cleaned up the mushrooms and made me make more a few hours after dinner! This is definitely a keeper and I'm going to go make some for myself right now! =) Thanks for the recipe!!",
