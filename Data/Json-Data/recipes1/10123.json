I used lower sodium bacon (the only thing we ever have) three fresh tomatoes and a small yellow onion (again because this is what I had on hand). I omitted the added salt and poured off the extra grease and added a bit of extra pepper. As I found the sauce a bit dry for our tastes I did about 1/4 cup of no-sodium chicken broth and simmered. I added the bacon parmesan cheese and some parsley to the pan just before serving and sprinkled a handful of crumbled fresh mozzarella on top on the plates. Very tasty and well received by my husband college age daughter and her friend. I gave it five stars because although I did not follow the recipe as written this is an excellent \"idea\" recipe to enjoy and be creative. I will make this again. Next time I am thinking I might try the sauce with the cream mentioned by another reviewer instead of the chicken broth. I am thinking that another time I might vary by adding grilled chicken pieces. Thank you for the versatile recipe.",

My husband said it was restaurant quality....music to a cooks ears!! Per other reviews I doubled the tomatoes(I used diced tomatoes seasoned with basil garlic & oregano) added a 14 oz can of chicken broth and added 1 cup of 1/2 & 1/2. I wanted to serve this as a main dish so I diced and sauteed 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts. I set aside and sauteed yellow onion diced red bell pepper and garlic in a portion of the bacon grease. I added the tomatoes & chicken broth and simmered for 10 minutes then added the 1/2 & 1/2 and 12 oz angel hair pasta. I served topped with bacon chicken and fresh grated parmesan cheese. This is recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.",

I had to double up on the sauce ingredients (with lots of extra garlic) and I even cut back on the pasta. Will definitely make again though. Oh I also used only a small amount of the bacon drippings NO WAY you need all of that to saute. And I was also a little upset as there is no directions on WHAT TO DO WITH THE BACON. Is it supposed to be incorporated in the pasta/sauce or sprinkled on top with the cheese? Well anways......mine turned out delish....hope yours does too.",
