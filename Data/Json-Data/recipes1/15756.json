After one glass I was ready to dilute it with some 7-up (which was very good by the way). Next time I will probably cut back on the watermelon. If you are wondering how much watermelon you need - buy ONE of the round seedless watermelons and that is more than enough. I didn't know what simple syrup was so those of you that don't know....its 2 parts sugar to one part water (1 cup of sugar to 1/2 cup of water is plenty for this recipe). Boil the water add the sugar stirring constantly until desolved remove from heat and there you have it - simple syrup!",

My watermelons were average in sweetness, but I still omitted the simple syrup. The result was perfect. I used Cointreau instead of triple sec, but both are sweet, so the simple syrup is not needed. If I had added the syrup, the drink would have been disgustingly sweet. So, make as is - but forget the syrup!!!",

Maybe I did something wrong but I ended up with over 8 cups of juice before I added any wine, vodka, etc.. I don't have anything big enough to hold all that and the small ratio of wine to juice didn't seem right either. I ended up using a 2 quart pitcher, mixing the triple sec, vodka and simple syrup into the juice, adding the fruit and wine to the pitcher and filling up the rest with the juice mixture. It was very, very good still.",

The first time I halved it and the only thing I had to change was I used light corn syrup instead of simple syrup. (I assembled all ingredients before I realized I hadn't made any!) Then I topped each glass with some lemon-lime pop just for some fizz. It is so light and delicious and to say it tastes like summertime is very accurate. The second time I made it due to my lazyness I just squeezed the juice of the orange and lime right into it. I didn't want all those pieces of fruit gettin' in the way of some good drinking!;) You can have your alcohol and still feel healthy about it. Thanks for the recipe!",
