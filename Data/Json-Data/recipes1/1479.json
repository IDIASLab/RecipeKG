I substituted 1 1/2 Cups unsweetened applesauce for the shortening, Splenda for the sugar, and used whole wheat flour in place of the all purpose flour.  I added 3 Tbsps Smart Balance butter to enhance the taste since fat is a flavor transfer.  In addition, I reduced the baking soda to 3 tsps and added 3 tsps of baking powder.  Due to my preference, I used 3 Cups Raisin Bran and 3 Cups of All Bran.  The muffins came out excellent! Next time, (and there will be a next time!) I will add 1 Cup of raisins as others have suggested.  Enjoy!",

You can always add raisins too. #2 - I substitute 1/2 the sugar amount with molasses.  It adds moisture, a touch of extra sweetness (these are not super sweet muffins), and we love the molasses flavor!\r\nYou can also add a basic muffin topping to them for added appeal - just mix melted butter, flour and brown sugar until crumbly, and add to the muffin tops.  Yum!  :  )",

Family will see the \"pretty muffins\" and choose a visible easy-to-grab healthy snack over other junk foods. Also freeze well so bake all freeze extras and put note on freezer door to remind family to microwave a muffin. Yum! I can't leave any recipe alone so made the following changes: For a healthier version skip the raisin bran (too much sugar) and just use all bran flakes. Substituted fresh-ground whole wheat flour for the white flour. (Can substitute up to 1/3 other flours such as oat soy etc. for the wheat flour. Can also substitute a cup of slow-cook oats for the flour as well.) Substitute molasses for up to 1/3 of the sugar and also just plain reduce sugar by 1/3 (They're still plenty sweet). Substitute applesauce or pureed beans for the shortening. Substitute 1/3 of the baking soda for baking powder. Reduce salt. VARIATIONS: Spices to add: pumpkin pie spice cinnamon nutmeg. Fruits & vegetables to add: apples blueberries raspberries cranberries raisins craisins grated carrots or zucchini. Other fun add-ins: jelly in the middle chocolate chips nuts.",
