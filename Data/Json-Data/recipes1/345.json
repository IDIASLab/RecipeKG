The dough is very very sticky but I found it easier when I added a bit more flour and kept my hands floured. The end result is worth it.",

I combined the dry ingredients first and then mixed in the wet ingredients last & my dough didn't spread out like other reviewers mentioned... it held its shape just fine. I did take it out of the oven after about 20 minutes to cut it and mine didn't crumble on me, but it think if I had left it in for the whole 30 minutes the edges would have started to crumble when cut. I also reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups instead of 2 and it was plenty sweet. Thanks for the recipe!",
