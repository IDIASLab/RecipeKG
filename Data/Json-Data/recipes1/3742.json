I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes doubled the cheese(next time i'll triple it) and added onion powder(I didn't have onion salt as someone suggested they used) It was really tasty not dry at all. I also cooked my pasta to Al Dente so it wouldn't turn to mush. Next time I will cook it for 30 minutes instead of 45 mins because I think that is too long. The pasta is already cooked and the sauce is hot. Otherwise this was yummy and I think it is a keeper!",

I used fresh tomatoes not canned and also added some steamed broccoli. I crushed some wheat crackers for the topping. It was delicious everyone had thirds!",

I tend to use recipes as mere guides so the changes I made were: adding about 1/3 cup of diced American cheese to the Cheddar (makes it creamier w/o the Cheddar oils) a full tsp of Italian seasoning instead of 1/2 tsp I didn't have breadcrumbs so used dry seasoned stuffing mix The flavor was fantastic but it was a little dry. Next time I'm using 3/4 to 1 cup milk and cutting the baking time down to the point at which it's merely heated throughout. Come winter this will be in my regular rotation of dishes!",
