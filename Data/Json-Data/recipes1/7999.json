One trick I learned to keep the layers separate is to pour your bottom layer into the pie crust first then chill in the refrigerator for half an hour or so before adding the pumpkin layer.

If you love pumpkin pie & cheesecake like we do you've got the best of both worlds in this recipe. A few hints to those who have had problems with this recipe. Make the pie in 2 steps after putting the cream cheese layer in the shell refrig. until you've mixed the pumpkin layer it will firm up slightly & lessen the chance of the layers mixing. Also if you have the problem of the layers inverting which our family has experienced in the past we've figured out a definite culprit. DO NOT USE PUMPKIN PIE MIX IN THIS RECIPE. This is the canned pumpkin with spice already added to it it will definitely flip-flop your layers! Try a slice with a dollop of whipped cream for that bit of extra sweetness! YUMMY!",

I also put 2 teaspoons of nutmeg and just poured the maple syrup into the pumpikin batter. I also added a teaspoon of almond extract to the cream cheese mixture and doubled the vanilla (can never have too much vanilla! what can I say southern families make everything spicier!) I did wait about 20 minutes before pouring the pumpkin onto the cream cheese it was well set by then. I used my cast iron pan for the pie and it came out lovely! Thanks for the recipe! It's great!",
