I also used an extra 1/4 tsp of cardamom. I ended up with too much liquid so i used this to make the frosting by mixing what was left in the bowl with powdered sugar. This i drizzled on the bars as soon as they came out of the oven. delicious!!",

I forgot to add the almonds to the batter so instead I roasted sliced almonds and sprinkled them on top of the frosting. Also I had to bake them far longer than 18-20 minutes. It was almost 29 minutes before they were baked through and I don't normally have trouble with my oven so I think the recipe may be off. I used a glass pan so I don't know if that made any difference? I plan to add these to my Holiday Cookie Tray.",
