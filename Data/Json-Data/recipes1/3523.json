Instead of puree use a 14.50 can of crushed tomatoes that you puree in the blender or food processor. Use no water. The amount of tomatoey sauce will help with the overwhelming herb taste that some people have described. Keep all other ratios the same. Best served with garlic bread or crostini topped with parmesan cheese.",
