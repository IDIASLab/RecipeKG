Although I think next time, I might sprinkle a little bit of sugar on them before baking to give them that \"sugar cookie\" taste.\n\nI didn't follow the directions as written.  Instead, I colored 1/4 of the dough green and the rest red.  I then shaped the red into a log with a flat bottom, rolled out the green and covered the red log with a thin layer of the green - then refrigerated the log.  The next morning, I just sliced the cookies, added the chips and baked - very easy!",

I made it even harder on myself because I didn't have mini chocolate chips so I ended up individually cuting the regular chips in half (insane I know)!  But everyone was impressed and they taste great.  I washed an empty soup can to cut out the circles and that seemed to be the perfect size baked for 8 min.  Cute, cute, cute cookies!",

I didn't have the mini chips and i cut my big ones in half like another reviewer, and that is just plain crazy!  next time i'll wait til i go to the store!  I added about 8 drops of food coloring to the red batter, rolled them out using powdered sugar instead of flour, and baked them for just over 8 min.  Take them off the sheet quickly, the ones i let set for a couple of minutes i almost didn't get off the pan.  I wanted a little more finished look so i piped a white line (the rine) using a ziploc baggie snipped at the end after I frosted with the green.  A made the white (about 1 c powdered sugar and T water) almost too thick to pipe so it wouldn't run over the green.  Next time i think i might add some more sugar to the dough (1/4 c), as it wasn't quite sweet enough for my sugar cookie preference.  Picture perfect summer cookies!  EDIT: these cookies ended up being terribly crumbly.  They were perfectly cooked but they just didn't keep well.  Would use a different sugar cookie base next time.",
