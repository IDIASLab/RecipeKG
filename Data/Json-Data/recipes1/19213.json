Seriously, I couldn't be happier... great with wings, the celery & carrot-dipping, great with a wedge salad (with bacon, Chef John! can't forget the bacon!) In this recipe, the freezing and grating of the cheese is key. Thank you, Chef John! You've made my food world bigger and better.",

I used Duke's olive oil mayo, light sour cream, and fat free buttermilk to reduce the calories, but I used regular blue cheese because low fat blue cheese is just WRONG in so many ways! I also splashed in around 1 tsp. of white wine vinegar in it because I always add that to my blue cheese dressing. With these changes I got the calories down to around 135 calories per 1/4 cup serving size. I did not miss any of the fat I cut out! Thank you Chef John for this great recipe.",

I followed it exactly except I was in a hurry and did not freeze the cheese.  The dressing will be able to sit 6 hours before I serve it tonight with chipotle popcorn chicken.  I can definitely see the advantage to freezing the cheese and will do so next time.  I like all of the proportions of ingredients that you used they are all in harmony.  Thank you for another great recipe!",
