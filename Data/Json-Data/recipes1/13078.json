Although my husband merely tolerated it (not a sauerkraut fan) I loved it and will attempt to cut the recipe in half to make just for myself. The chicken was super moist but as I thought 90 mins was a bit long to bake boneless breast I only baked for 60 mins and it was fully cooked. I also used chopped kraut to avoid the long strings. This is so attractive that it'd make a great \"company\" dish or \"buffet\" dish for a crowd! It really has a great tangy flavor just as long as you enjoy sauerkraut! A winner!",

Take the flat chicken breast and lay it flat lay a slice of corned beef then the cheese then the sauerkraut and roll it up. Place the rols in a dish preferably pyrex and bake. Instead of Thousand Island try serving it with Hollandaise sauce (just ladle over the individual rolls on each plate). If you serve ths with a pasta side & some broccoli or asparagus it makes a great meal and is very pleasing to the eye as well as the tongue!",

I love kraut and by putting the dressing over the top of everything it seemed to drown everything else out (which some people maybe prefer). Like I said though look at the ingredients/layers and just assemble it according to your preference. If you like the ingredients then the combination of flavors is good. Like other reviewers I baked 350 for an hour. Thanks for the great recipe!",
