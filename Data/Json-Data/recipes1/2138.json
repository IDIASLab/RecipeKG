The custard was divine - I baked it in bowls and garnished it with cinnamon. It made a lovely treat for a lazy evening as it was quite easy. The cheesecake I did the following adjustments: 1. I doubled the recipe - 4 bars of cream cheese. 2. I reduced the milk to 3/4 cup 3. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (I also used cane sugar) 4. I upped the vanilla by 1 teaspoon 5. I reduced the eggs to 2 6. I reduced the corn starch to 3 tablespoons 7. I added a little orange zest and about two tablespoons of fresh orange juice (after I whipped everything together while still mixing but before the eggs). I made a standard graham cracker crust baked it in a spring form pan and it was lovely.",
