This was a wonderful bread to make.  The modifications I made were using 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar, 2 tsp. vanilla, 2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. nutmeg.  I then added mini choc. chips and raisins.  With the pineapple well drained, the batter is thick and none of the raisins or choc. chips sunk to the bottom.  This recipe made 3 mini loafs (baked for 35 min) and 1 8x5 loaf. After running around the edge with a knife, they all just slid out of the pan.  No sticking!  This is my new recipe for zucchini bread.  I won't bother cont. the search for my old one.",

I expected a good muffin but I also expected it to be ordinary. Zucchini contributes moisture of course but it's basically tasteless! What I got was anything BUT ordinary. Rather than the moist but bland muffin I expected I was treated to a pleasantly sweet richly pineapple flavored muffin! I've made pineapple-zucchini bread for years and years but always with spices which left the pineapple barely noticeable. This was remarkably otherwise! Other than using half a recipe to make 12 (gorgeous) muffins I followed the recipe exactly right down to the nuts and raisins. To pump up the pineapple flavor even further I drizzled them with a simple glaze of 1 c. powdered sugar a dribble of corn syrup for sheen and some of the drained pineapple juice I had set aside. Delicious and unexpected in its uniqueness. I wish I had tried this recipe a long time ago.",
