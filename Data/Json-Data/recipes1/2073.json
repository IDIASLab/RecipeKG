                "reviewBody": "Excellent and very moist.  Definitely don't bake longer than 50 min.  I usually use 3 medium size bananas - which yields about 1 1/2 cups.  The less bananas you use, the less cooking time, by 3-5 minutes less. Use all butter for best flavor. This recipe does need spices: 1.5 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and use all brown sugar - reducing to 3/4 cup is plenty sweet) - all seems to be the best ratio. I've made this about a dozen times and these additions make it perfect.  This is also easier to make than \"Banana Banana Bread\" from this site since it requires less bananas - having 2 or 3 ripe bananas is more likely than 5 or 7 & this one has more banana flavor and is more moist.  I've made both but use this one for my master recipe.  TIP - this bread is pretty moist, but if you need to prolong it even more for giving away, add 2 tablespoon vegtable oil. **update** I have substituted buttermilk for regular milk, and the bread came out super moist. It also improved the texture, making it lighter & spongier.  I also cover it tightly with foil after it's baked to let it steam for 1/2 hour or more.  A bakery secret for all loaf breads to lock in the moisture.",

I was pretty dissapointed with it.  It didn't have as much banana flavor as I like and wasn't as sweet as I like.  It also wasn't moist at all. I found this one and decided to make it and the only thing that I found bad about it was that it kinda had the tendancy to fall apart. I might try adding another egg to prevent this next time that I make it. Other than that, it was absolutely delicious!!! It's very very moist and had lots of banana flavor.  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla to it, so maybe that helped!!!  Good luck and Happy cooking!  :-)",

I screwed up and mixed the sugar in with the other dry ingredients instead of the butter and it still turned out fine. After reading some of the reviews, I followed their advice and added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and increased the banana amount to 1.5 cups. I also did half brown sugar, half granulated sugar. I made one loaf with walnuts and topped it with more walnuts and about 1/3 c. brown sugar. It created a toasted carmelized top that tasted superb! Would be really good served at a brunch or shower. The only thing I would have changed would be adding more salt, maybe 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. per recipe. A little advice: to make sure the bread doesn't come out \"doughy\", temp the bread and don't take it out of the oven until it has reach a temp of 190 degrees F.",
