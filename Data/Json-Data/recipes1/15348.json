I didn't have any brown sugar so I used white sugar and about a tablespoon and a half of molasses- that may have changed the consistancy because I didn't have as much trouble getting them off the cookie sheet as previous reviewers. If you let them sit about 30 seconds before trying to get them off and only make about 6-7 cookies at a time you shouldn't have a problem. Thanks Deb!",
