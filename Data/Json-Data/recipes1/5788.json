After a few modifications- omited the dill(my family dosen't care for it), used a tablespoon each of onion powder, garlic powder and old bay. Increased this flour by 1/2 cup and baking power to 1 and 1/2 teaspoons, decreased the milk to 1/4 cup, also the beer(budweiser)to 1/2 cup. As one other cook noted; leave to filets in the batter for 30 mins, it worked out great. No problems with the batter sticking, but make sure you dry the fish well before placing it in the batter bowl. I used a mixture of talapia and walleye, everyone loved it! Even me, a very picky fish eater! Served with Vicky's hushpuppies.",

I added a 1/2 cup of corn meal to the batter, also some garlic & onion powder to taste and/or fish seasoning. I also let the fish sit in the batter for 30 min. This made the batter a bit thicker on the fish and made it stick well. My entire family loved this recipe. I am also expected to make this recipe for my neighbor. She buys the fish I cook it. We now have an awesome batter for our fish. Thanks",

Then I increased the 1/2 cup of flour to 2/3 and used 2 Tbls. of fresh dill instead of the 1/4 tsp. used in the scaled version. The fish was dredged in flour before the batter was put on. I let the fish sit in the batter in the fridge for 30-45 minutes. I used catfish but a firmer fish next time would probably be be even better.  I used about 1/4 inch of oil in a pan and fried it on medium to medium high heat for about 5 minutes a side. Although we really enjoyed it, I think next time I will add more dill, more beer (decreasing the milk proportionately), and perhaps some onion powder.  This was also the first time I did not have the batter slide off of what I was frying.  I think the time setting up in the fridge is what made the difference",

I really hate to give this 2 stars but this recipe really let me down. Will try the triple dipped chicken batter from this site for fish next time. I know THAT will stay crispy and taste amazing!!!
