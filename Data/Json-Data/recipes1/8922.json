If you use powdered sugar as the other reviews mention the substitution ratio given on this site is 1 3/4 c. pwdr sugar = 1 c. granulated sugar. I used granulated and had no problems but you have to beat & beat & beat the sugar/butter/shortening for a VERY long time until the sugar dissolves or you will have gritty filling. Maybe not the job for a hand held mixer!",

AND....I had an old banana and added that to the cake for kicks & giggles (will ALWAYS do that!). Now for the \"filling\"...I could NOT find any banana extract on the day I was to make this SO I purchased some Loran's Banana Cream Oil...yes the kind used for candy making...BUT you CAN add it to other things as well. I put in a DROP at a time just until I got a very \"light\" banana flavor and was I glad I did...it balanced out the MEGA MOIST banana cake with the not so \"sweet\" filling. Am I gushing?:-) It's a GREAT recipe and something different to do with an old banana or two! THANKS FOR POSTING THIS...really!",
