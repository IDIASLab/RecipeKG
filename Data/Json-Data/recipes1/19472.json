It looked beautiful out of the oven but was virtually tasteless. When I saved the leftovers (there were a lot of them unfortunately) in the fridge I poured the pan sauce over the roast to keep it moist. Next day I sliced off a piece and put some of the sauce on it. Incredible. My wife sent a note out to the poor people who had eaten the bland product from the night before explaining our mistake. Maybe I should have assumed the sauce in the pan was good as a gravy but I thought it might have been too greasy. Probably would have been a five star if I'd gotten it right the first time. Also as others have mentioned it cooks faster than the recipe indicates.",
