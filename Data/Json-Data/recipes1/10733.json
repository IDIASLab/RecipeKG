IF IT IS RAINY OR THERE IS TO MUCH HUMIDITY, THEN MOST LIKELY THEY WILL NOT SET. WELL THIS IS FOR LOUISIANA, IM NOT SURE ABOUT OTHER PLACES. SECOND, I WAS HAVING THE WORST TIME WITH THESE AT FIRST. I DIDNT KNOW HOW LONG TO MICROWAVE THEM FOR TO GET THEM RIGHT. THEN MY MOM GAVE ME THE BEST ADVICE. YOU TAKE A CUP OF ICE WATER; DROP A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE MIX IN THE WATER. IF IT HARDENS UP INTO A BALL, IT IS READY. IF NOT, IT NEEDS TO BE MICROWAVE FOR LONGER. ONCE I GOT IT RIGHT THESE WERE GREAT AND GONE IN A DAY.",

I'm in Florida, and although its not real humid right now in Dec., these still turned out just fine with all the windows open! I think my best Christmas gift will be seeing the look on my mothers face since she has tried had failed so many times attempting to make pralines! Also, I don't know how you could possibly get 3 dozen out of this recipe, I got 1 dozen smaller than New Orleans style pralines.",

Second, the pralines melt in your mouth, are not grainy, and are not too sweet. I did have to perfect the recipe to my microwave, however.  I had to microwave for a total of 12 minutes, and I did not stir for the whole three minutes.  I also must make my pralines too big b/c the most I ever got out of the recipe was 28.  I made this about a dozen times this year for Christmas gifts.  It takes me 20 minutes start to finish.  Thanks!",

After that I took them out every minute and checked the temp with a candy therm until they reached 240 degrees then added the vanilla and did the stirring (it did take 9 minutes of cook time for me). Three minutes of stirring was just about right. You want to stop stirring just when they start to look cloudy and start firming up a bit. Drop them on parchment as quick as you can the remaining mixture will continue to harden as it sits making it harder to scoop. If it seizes up on you or gets too hard add a spoonful of very hot water and stir until it loosens up. I used an average sized cereal spoon to scoop and got about 2 dozen. Try dipping these in the \"Hard Chocolate Glaze\" once they are cool it looks very fancy:)",
