I hate it when people tweek recipes... what's the point... however I loved this recipe base... it is perfect and everyone always asks for the recipes at parties. I do not care for celery... so I omitted that. Corn would probably be good in it... but I am used to it the old fashioned way... so I skipped the corn. I do not care for onion pieces in salads so i substituted onion powder like I always do. I don't measure out the paprika I just sprinkle across the top after it's made to give it color and flavor. Awesome recipe it's the only macaroni salad recipe ever use. This does make tons just the right size for a party otherwise cut recipe in half.",

Made as is except I used regular onion since I didn't have green onions and only had dill pickles so used that juice (which didn't do anything for tanging it up). NOTE: I made this again and am upping it to a 4. I guess I thought better of it second time around. I didn't note that I wasn't sure what \"creamy salad dressing\" was and the first time I used Marzetti's and second time Miracle Whip and I had the green onion this time. I really love Marzetti's so I'm going to assume I was just more in the mood for this this time. (Though I still didn't notice the corn.)",
