I would definitley give it a 5 for ease of working with the dough; it really had the best texture I've ever worked with for cutout cookies. As far as the flavor goes I would give it a 3 or maybe even a two. I don't like my cookies to be too sweet but these had very little flavor period. I bet the other reviewer had the right idea though when they said it was the perfect cookie recipe to use with lots of icing. If you had a really rich icing I think this would be the perfect cookie dough. And if I were to make cookies with kids I would definitely use this recipe because of how easy the dough was to work with. Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

The cookie is not too sweet (which I like - if you prefer a really sweet cookie this recipe is not for you) and the dough is very easy to handle. The bottoms were golden brown (I baked them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper) and the cookies held their shape very well. Be careful when cooking as the edges will start to turn golden but the tops of the cookies themselves do not brown. Mine were done at about 7 minutes at 350 degrees.",

Not to the point where you think you're eating flour but just not as sweet as most sugar cookies I've made before.. But still really fantastic! This is exactly the kind of sugar cookie recipe I was looking for. I was making Halloween sugar cookies to put onto my son's birthday cake to decorate it and I was going to put frosting on them anyway. These are great with frosting and the dough is incredibly easy to work with. I usually don't make cut out cookies because I hate having to roll out the dough and deal with that whole mess but this recipe didn't give me any problem at all. I'll definitely be making these again. Thanks!",
