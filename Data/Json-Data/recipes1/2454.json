It was delicious! I also do not like meringue at all so I used whipped cream (can use cool whip) to top the pie with and then sprinked the peanut butter/confectioners sugar on top. It was out of this world! If you are a peanut butter lover like I am you will love this pie! Also I made my pie with a home made graham cracker crust. This pie is addicting!",

In addition to the pie crust there is a layer of sugar and peanut butter then a layer of vanilla pudding then merginue then more peanut butter and sugar on top. VERY GOOD but VERY RICH! Not sure I would make again unless someone requests. Probably best saved for a holiday pie. (: Thanks for the post! Original review: This is definitly a labor of love type of recipe! I had a sink full of bowls pans spoons scrapers at the end! My 9 year old picked this recipe all by himself to make for his Pawpaw as a thank you. I was thinking more of a no-bake pie but he ended up picking this one that used the oven twice. (: Will update on taste it did make a beautiful pie! Will post a pic too.",

Only change I made was in the assembly: Put in most of the peanut butter/sugar mixture in the bottom of the baked crust. Save a couple of tablespoons for the topping. Another note: add 1/2 tsp cream of tartar to the whites; take care in spreading the meringue on the custard. For a very stiff meringue trying to spread it over the custard can displace the custard causing it to push itself over the edge of the crust. I suggest you drop small amounts around the edges and then over the entire custard surface then spread carefully to create a uniform covering. Really very easy and very tasty.",
