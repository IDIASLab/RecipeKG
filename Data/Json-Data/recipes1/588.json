I used all whole wheat flour doubled the yogurt (used low fat vanilla) halfed the sugar to 1/2 cup since the yogurt is already sweetened (used only brown sugar) used 1 whole egg rather than 2 egg whites (why waste it?) and skipped the butter flavored granules. Instead of adding in my oatmeal and raisins last I stirred it in with my wet ingredients before adding the flour mixture to absorb some moisture. To make up for the butter flavor I would use butter-flavored non stick spray. I had to bake mine for 11 minutes to get them cooked through and they were just a bit more than a tbs per cookie. After baking I let them sit on the baking sheet for about 3 minutes so they can be chewy. Put them in the fridge and they will stay moist and will be chewy. They actually taste better the next day! Hope my review helped! =D",

These are exactly what I always thought oatmeal cookies should be like- moist chewy mmmmm mmmmm good. I used peach flavored yogurt- the whole 8 oz. of it- and I felt like I was eating peach oatmeal in delicious cookie form. I can't believe it's not butter in these. My fiance loved them- and he thought I was lying when I told him there was no butter. Enjoy!",

To start with I added 1tsp cinnamon and didn't bother with the salt butter buds or vanilla extract. I also used all brown sugar instead of some of each. The cookies took over 15 mins to bake and were still just starting to brown on top. I know ff cooking doesn't tend to brown as attractively as recipes that use butte/marg but I did think the cooking time was a bit short. After tasting them I will make the following changes next time: using more oats and less flour as I thought the oats were a bit lost; using a dah of ground mixed spice in addition to the cinnamon I added and baking them for 20 mins. They weren't horrible but were extremely average.",

I've tried cutting back on the sugar to see if that was the problem but the glaze is still there. I agree that the cooking time needs to be longer.
