Added 1 clove of minced garlic in with the onions, used half & half combined with corn starch instead of milk and added 1 can of cream-style corn in with the frozen corn.  I also sauted the chicken in the bacon fat along with the onions and garlic for added flavor.  Topped with the  bacon and added cheddar cheese. The soup turned out very creamy and hearty. My husband and I both loved it.",

I added cornstarch (mixed into a little of the broth then stirred into the soup) during cooking and then let it sit a little while after cooking and that thickened it up a bit. I think adding a can of cream of mushroom soup might also help thicken it up and add some more flavor next time. I used whole milk instead of half and half because that's what I had. I also added about 2 cups of shredded cheddar at the end of cooking and we topped our bowls of soup with a little more cheddar.",
