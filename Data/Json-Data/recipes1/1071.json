Here's what I would add/change: Important...cool melted butter and shortening before adding to the mix (if you don't, you melt the chocolate chips). I would also cut the butter down to 3/4 or 1/2 as one user suggested; add 1/2 tsp. more ground cinnamon and split the sugar into 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup raw or demerrara or brown sugar. Other then that, I think the next batch should turn out better.",
