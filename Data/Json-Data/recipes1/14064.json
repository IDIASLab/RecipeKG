                "reviewBody": "I'm from the south and grew up on classic buttermilk cornbread. I've since moved and forgot my family recipe so I looked up a recipe here to jog my memory. This was a very good base recipe. The result was a crispy bottom and soft moist middle. The perfect cornbread in my eyes. However I did change a few things. First I used an iron skillet. If you want a good crispy crust you must you an iron skillet. I preheated the oven to 400 degrees as the recipe says then I put a cool iron skillet in the oven with a thin layer of vegetable oil on the bottom in the oven to heat. Heating the skillet before adding the mixture will prevent the bread from sticking. After preparing the skillet I Mixed the recipe together as directed except for a few minor exceptions. I did not use potato flakes or baking powder I used buttermilk (this is also a must for cornbread) and I added a cup of cornmeal instead of 1/2 cup. Then I carefully took the hot skillet out of the oven (be careful by now its HOT) Added the mixture and baked for 20 minutes. After the 20 minutes was up I changed the stove to high broil to brown the top not required but it adds a little extra something. If you do broil your break make sure to stay with it and watch it shouldn't take more than a few seconds 30 tops. Leaving it on broil too long will burn the bread. Good luck to anyone who makes this and thinks to Chefkimber for submitting a wonderful base recipe.",
