I saw a similar recipe that said it is ok to set aside and refrigerate the prepared batter for a few hours just remove and allow to come to room temperature before baking. I made the batter before dinner and took it out of the fridge just as we sat down to eat. I put them in the oven as we finished the meal. The cakes still looked a bit wet after 6 minutes so I left them 2 minutes longer. I'm not sure if this was because the batter was still a bit cold when I put them in. I used pyrex custard cups and they didn't unmold too well the one I tried to umold split and oozed all over the plate but they tasted just as good eaten from the dish rather than unmolded. Another thing I discovered is that if you heat a leftover cake in the microwave for 30 seconds it bubbles up like a volcano and tastes nearly as good as fresh out of the oven!",

Added some vanilla to eggs a pinch of salt and an extra teaspoon of flour. Used semi-sweet morsels (1/4 cup for 1/2 recipe). Baked 10 1/2 minutes but next time I'll try 12. They were a little too runny but this is a great recipe to HAVE to experiment with. Definitely serve with a sprinkle of powdered sugar vanilla ice cream and/or whipped cream. Super EZ to make after dinner and also used the microwave to melt butter and chocolate (40 secs). Used pyrex custard cups buttered and sugared. No problem sticking. Can't wait to make for company. Will add some fresh raspberries or strawberries on the side. These are the same pricey souffles that many of the \"Big\" name restaurants serve. Never knew they were so simple and bet you've got all the ingredients. GO MAKE THESE NOW! YUMMY!!!",

I make a lot of chocolate desserts and this is by far the best one I have made yet - as good as or better than I've had in restaurants. I cooked mine for 7 minutes only in glass custard dishes and they were perfect. However I used Baker's Secret spray rather than buttering and flouring the cups and they did not fall right out of the cups as I think they should have. Will butter and flour next time. Also used Ghiardelli bittersweet. I think semi-sweet would make the dish too sweet. Too bad this is not health food -- I could eat it every day!",

PLEASE DON'T LET MY RATING STOP YOU FROM MAKING THEM -- they are quite delcious! I recommend everyone to read other's reviews and make necessary adjustments before you make them. I made the followng changes: I used 2 tbsp of gluten free flour for this recipe buttered and sugared my cups (something I saw on Video Jug). I also used parchment paper to line the bottoms of my cups -- first I traced the bottom in pencil then cut out the circles. After they're cooked use a knife to loosen the edges. I cooked them for 10 minutes but will cook for 12 next time as they were too gooey. I dusted with icing sugar and served with raspberries and vanilla icecream.",
