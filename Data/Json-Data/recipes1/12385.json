I added some celery seed for a little extra flavor.  My husband says it's the best he's ever had, so I have to beat him to the bowl if I want any!",

In addition I'm not a big coleslaw fan so I guess you could say I was a tough sell. I admit I made this only because it seemed fitting to include it in my barbecued rib dinner. I made it easy on myself and simply used a packaged coleslaw mix and I substituted Splenda for the sugar. I also added celery seed. I tasted it right after I made it and was disappointed - it was noticeably sweet and mayonnaisey. I kept my fingers crossed that a couple of hours would mellow this out and balance the flavors. It did. I still can't call myself a convert to coleslaw but everyone enjoyed this including me.",
