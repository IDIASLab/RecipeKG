More like a potato pancake, instead of a true latkes, but that's just my personal preference. For every 2 cups of grated potato, one egg is really a sufficient binder, and any more than that just makes them too heavy. I also use alot less salt, but that again is to taste.   Instead of the flour, I have also found better results substituting matzoh ball mix, which contains baking soda and seasonings. They seem to come out lighter, and more flavorful this way. Don't  forget to add the grated onion... it's an absolute must in my opinion, and here again, I add twice as much. And I personally have never bothered with the cheesecloth thing. As you lift out spoonfuls, the moisture simply seeps to the bottom of the bowl. No problem. Don't wait for Hannukah to enjoy these treats, and don't forget the applesauce (or sour cream.) Enjoy!",

I used the food processor's large grater blade and kept the grated potato in ice water until I had all the ingredients in the bowl and then squeezed the water out and added them.  I used matzoh meal instead of flour and I used about triple the grated onion.  I fried them in vegetable oil. They were great, but definitely on the salty side.  The mixture was a little watery but it made no difference in the end, there was liquid in the bowl when I was done. I think the matzah meal was key. Next time I would use less salt.",

I remember when my mom would make these and she would always complain about the shredding of the potatoes but it really wasn't a big deal--in fact it was kind of fun. To keep the potatoes from oxidizing I would ring out the water from the potatoes after every two thirds of a potato peeled with paper towels (because I didn't have cheese cloth on hand). Paper towels worked just fine. The sooner you ring out the potatoes after shredding the less oxidation occurs. Once rung out they keep pretty well. I also added extra onion. I was told to be a true latke you make them small and thin and cook the heck out of them. The cooking took longer than the shredding that's for sure. Excellent as leftovers too.",
