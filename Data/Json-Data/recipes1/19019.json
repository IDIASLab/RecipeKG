I also used vanilla bean frozen yogurt, but just expected something more creamy or smoothie like. I even used frozen blueberries. It only tasted like blended berries and juice, in my opinion. The individual frozen yogurt cups aren't cheap either. They taste good and I would rather have just eaten it plain then to have used it in this. It was just a little too juice like and sweet for my taste.",

The blueberry juice cocktail is the star in this smoothie adding just a little bit of tartness. The yogurt brought the smoothness and did not dominate as happens way too often with smoothies. We enjoyed this for breakfast today and definitely will be making again.",

Still not quite what she needs for breakfast so I'll keep trying new recipes. I gave it a 4 because I enjoyed the original with yogurt!!",
