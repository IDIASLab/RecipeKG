Instead of using 4 cans of stewed tomatoes, I use 2 cans of stewed tomatoes and 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/ green chilis.  This makes the chili spicy.  If you don't like much spice, but want some spice, try 3 cans of stewed tomatoes and 1 can of the diced tomatoes w/green chilis. I think it's Del Monte that makes the diced tomatoes w/green chilis.  I also add more beans and more chili powder.  I keep twirking the recipe until I get what I like.  I'm going to be making this for a chili cook-off really soon, so I'm hoping everyone likes it as much as my family does!",

Rather than plain chili powder, I used The Spice Hunter brand's \"Chili Powder Blend\" which has cocoa powder, cumin, cinnamon and cloves, among other things.  I really think that added a great flavor. I also used S&W brand Mexican seasoned stewed tomatoes.  Delicious! One more thing,...I added my kidney beans in with the tomatoes rather than waiting an hour and it turned out fine.",
