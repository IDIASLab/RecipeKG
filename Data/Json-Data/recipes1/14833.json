I think there's not enough lime juice called for here, probably because the size of \"1 jicama\" can vary a lot; you may need to adjust on the fly. For our tastes this required the addition of salt. (Note: I added a cucumber and doubled the recipe, but left the chili powder measurement the same, due to the color.)",

I thought this tasted a little flat so I added a sprinkling of garlic powder some kosher salt and a good grinding of pepper. I probably ended up using more than 2 tablespoons of lime juice I just squeezed two limes over the jicama. I was quite pleased with the end result and I'm taking these to work to snack on.
