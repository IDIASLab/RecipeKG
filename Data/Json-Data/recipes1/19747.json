I knew chunks of cream cheese would not have been tolerated by the kids....  The overall flavor is good.\n :-)",

The near failure resulted from making it ahead, and refrigerating to pop in the oven later.  After baking, the tortillas could not be pried from the pan and I suspect it was because the tortillas absorbed the enchilada sauce and then burned when baked.  Flavor was still wonderful, and I'm giving it 5 stars because that was an error on my part, but the presentation was lacking. Both times I made the Spanish Rice II, also found on this site, as a side dish.  Outstanding!!",

Shout out to Selina my sous-chef who assembled and baked these for us!:) The only hitch we had in the dish was forgetting to put sauce in the pan before the tortillas - the bottom layer was baked on pretty hard - still looked and tasted delicious and we will make again!",
