I made this recipe for my 83-year-old uncle who was a country butcher (as well as my grandfather).  He gave me the family's commercial recipe for authentic mincemeat last year and I wanted him to sample my efforts some of which was frozen.  I had a 1# pack of homemade mincemeat in the freezer so that's what I added instead of the 2 c.  All in all, I wish I would have added more cinnamon and nutmeg, and maybe salt too as another reviewer suggested because they were a little bland--certainly nowhere near the punch you get from a hot pie after Christmas dinner.  I love the texture of the cookies and I'm sure they'll ship well to uncle.  Note I made a glaze of confec. sugar and Southern Comfort.  I added about 1/4 cup of SoCo to the dough as well.",
