I tried it once with natural peanut butter and \"healthy\" corn flakes and it was a disaster... they were so hard I broke a knife point trying to cut them after they cooled. But with really creamy peanut butter (I used Peter Pan) and commercial cornflakes (Kellogg's) the result was crunchy light and delicious. I was even able to cut back a little on the corn syrup and substitute 2 T. of water and they still came out perfect. I also like to sprinkle a few extra chocolate chips on the top since the chocolate has a tendency to melt when the mixture is still warm.",

Quick easy and always a hit... not sure that they taste like a babe ruth bar but who cares they taste great. Only tips I have: I mix the corn flakes PB and choc chips in a large bowl then am able to dump them in the melted mixture and get a better blend of ingredients. I also line a 13x9 pan with aluminum foil and then press the bars into it. Once in fridge for little while you can pull them out of the pan by the foil and then use a pizza cutter to cut them into squares of any size. Be careful you don't fridgerat them too long though--they become a real booger to cut.",

They are also great for showers and holiday cookie exchanges with a little bit of fancying up! I eliminate the white sugar and use 1 cup brown sugar. The white sugar may be part of the reason people have trouble cutting the bars. Also since I have always used chunky peanut butter I don't use extra peanuts. Often I just leave out the chocolate chips or I use them spread on top as a sort of icing. You can change up this recipe so many ways and it is always great if you can get past its homely appearance!",
