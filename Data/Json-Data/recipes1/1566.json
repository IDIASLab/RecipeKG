The first one I made had cherry pie filling (yum), and I have tried blueberry, apple, and peach pie filling.  The cherry dump cake recipe uses cinnamon; therefore, I use plenty with all of the pie fillings. Also, don't bother cutting the butter; just melt it.  Vary the amount of butter depending your taste. (Real butter makes a big difference.) I like cake mix on the top and bottom.  Experiment.  Blueberry, apple, and peach pie filling might need added sweetener or sugar; just taste it before assemblying the cake.\r\nDon't expect an actual cake to pop out of the oven; expect a cobbler.  If you're not pleased, try changing something (i.e. the amount of butter, coverage of the butter, sweetener, cooking time, etc.)",

NO WAY...Came out way soggy & i even drained a lil juice since I was trying the melted butter way. NOPE not for me.. The other is a little time consuming because you have to cover all AREAS with thinly sliced butter or will have dry patches. The time is worth it to me. Did not like the melted butter way, wish I did a lot quicker.. but nope...  read my other review on this because this is outta this world good!!!!",

I was a little hesitant because it seemed way too easy.  I made it and followed some other reviewers suggestions and added 1/2 cup brown sugar sprinkled on top followed by the cinnamon.

Everybody loved it and I received just as many compliments when I make the homemade version! I read the reviews and also put a stick of butter in the freezer before grating on top of the cobbler. I also used the butter recipe yellow cake mix and used 3 cans of the peaches (only used the syrup of 2 cans). I added brown sugar, vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to give it that extra something.  It was a big hit and I have already made 3 times for guests.

Made the recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful, but I have since customized it to my family's preference.  Increased the peaches to 2.5 cans and drained the syrup from the 3rd can only (we like more peaches), used peaches in LIGHT syrup and I haven't been able to tell the difference.  Sprinkled cinnamon over peaches before adding the cake mix and then finished the recipe with a 1/3 cup dark brown sugar on top of the cake mix, followed by the the cinnamon and finally chilled a cube of butter and grated it over the top (handheld cheese grater works wonders for this).  This spreads the butter more evenly and allows it to achieve a crystalized finish. Rave reviews every time!",
