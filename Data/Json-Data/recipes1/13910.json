I slice the potatoes and fresh carrots extremely thin as if making potato chips. Layer the potatoes on bottom of casserole dish, sprinkle  with salt and pepper, layer with carrots, salt and pepper, sprinkle with raw long grain wild rice, 2/3 of a bag of frozen peas, topped with grounded beef browned with the onions and green pepper. I use a full can of tomato soup and 3/4 can of water or so. Cover and bake 1 hour 15 minutes. Uncover and bake 15 minutes longer. Top with shredded cheddar cheese and return to oven until melted. My family LOVES this recipe. The kids always request it for their birthday meal. It takes a little time to cut the veggies so thinly and the baking time is long, but it's a winner every time. Have tried it with cream of mushroom soup, but we prefer the tomato. ",

Thinly sliced some red potatoes, cut baby carrots in half, instead of buttering the pan, I put some butter on top of the onions.  I didn't drain the canned peas and it turned out fine, the rice was perfect.  Browned ground turkey instead of the sausage.  Also I used cream of mushroom, like someone else mentioned, next time I may put an extra can in.  In short it was good!  I liked it a lot.  My husband said it was okay, but he tends to like things with a kick.  May try it in the crock pot next time.\nThanks for the recipe!!!",

I ve made this several times since with smoked sausages hotdogs pork breakfast sausages.. all of them taste great with this recipe!
