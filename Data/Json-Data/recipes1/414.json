I never give the recipe out because I've never seen a cookie recipe that calls for pudding before so I sort of consider it the secret ingredient of my signature cookie recipe. I always use Butter Flavor Crisco and a whole bag of chips. This recipe is easy to vary into peanut butter by using 1/2 c crisco and 1 c pb. You can make it into oatmeal cookies by using only 1 and 1/4 c of flour and 3 c of old fashioned oats. Or spice it up and use chocolate pudding and vanilla chips or peanut butter chips. Just have fun with this recipe. There are soooo many possibilities!!!",

Made mine a little more moist by totally melting butter, adding 2+ tablespoons milk, and left out about 1 Tbsp pudding mix;  also added chopped walnuts and about 1/2 teaspoon more vanilla extract;  best if dropped, not flattened (tried both); when dropped, yields cookie with a slight crunch as you bite into it, but then the middle just melts in your mouth;  yes, the center is somewhat cake-like (per vanilla pudding mix), but that's what makes this cookie so good/different--- it's a thick, but moist cookie (not flat and crunchy or flat and gooey or thick and dry)",

I did take the advice of the viewers and added 1/4 tsp of salt, and I used NESTLE semi-sweet chocolate chunks instead of chips. Man they were AWESOME.  Definitely cook them for 10 mins, and they are so soft!!!Update: Ive made these quite a few times, and I tried it with just one stick of butter, and, they are still just as good, and deliciously soft without all the fat!",
