I also added an orange glaze (2T juice, 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla).

I only had 1 cup of zucchini I had frozen in a zippy bag, so chopped another cup of apple.  subbed out the cinnamon with apple pie spice.  Omitted nuts and used special dark chocolate chips.  I love the combo of flavor with the orange and dark chocolate, as well as the spice.  Replaced all the oil with applesauce.  This looks very pretty when cut.  *This makes a nice thick batter, so chocolate chips are evenly distributed throughtout and do not sink to the bottom which sometimes can occur in a thinner batter. A nice holiday bread with a nice change of pace from the mundane zucchini bread recipe.  The cooking time in my oven was within the perimeters stated in the recipe.",
