I made one once where I thought it would be a good idea to mix all the dry and wet ingredients together then add to the pie shell bad idea. It never set! The way I learned to make them was to add the dry ingredients to the pie shell then add the wet ingredients and mix carefully using only 2 fingers so you don't tear the crust. It sounds odd but it works perfectly everytime. Hope this helps.",

The Woman I Love took a spoonful of the filling and she thought it was good and tasted a bit like a maple sugar donut. But I had the whole pie to myself otherwise and I managed to finish it all in 5 days. I was a little mixed-up when preparing this and didn't mix everything in the exact order given but I did use all the correct ingredients and proportions. Maybe my oven is a little off or maybe it's the altitude (6200 feet) but this pie wound up being kind of soupy with the given baking time. Even after chilling in the fridge until the next day it still hadn't entirely set. So I'd recommend that others might want to bake this longer or perhaps cut down a little on the water used.",
