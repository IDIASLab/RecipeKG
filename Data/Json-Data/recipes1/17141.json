I found out about this wonderful liqueur on a trip to Cape Town and knew it would be a great ingredient in many recipes. This dessert fondue is terrific with cookies, strawberries, orange slices, melons, marshmallows, etc. It is extremely easy to make, but your guests will think it you slaved over it.",

I'm sure it's wonderful but since I wanted to make this at the spur of the moment I needed a hasty substitute so I just used hot brewed coffee. It was delicious even without this exotic liqueur and I'm sure it would have been as good or better had I used it. Since chocolate is the star of the show in chocolate fondue I used a fine quality bittersweet chocolate rather than the chocolate chips. This is rich smooth and creamy though I increased the amount of cream a bit while reducing the amount of liqueur (again I used strong brewed coffee). I found that scaling this to 6 servings was more than enough for hubby and me and the leftover fondue was perfect for chocolate covered strawberries!",
