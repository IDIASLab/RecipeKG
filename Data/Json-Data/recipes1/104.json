I added half a cup more flour to the recipe, and they came out soft and chewy, and about as high as I'd like. (Maybe 1/4 cup more flour next time to get them really fat...) I was out of chips, so skipped that, and they were still great as basic chocolate cookies. And since they were plain on the inside, I made up for it by rolling the cookies in powdered sugar before baking. That came out well. You could add anything to this dough; the idea of orange extract and zest crossed my mind, or maybe mac nuts with almond extract.",

I omitted the salt and added a little bit of milk because the mixture was really dry. I was a little timid about the amount of sugar - I did put the 2 cups in, but next time I'll probably cut that down. They came out really nice and chewy - very heavy though, very chocolatey. I made two trays of biscuits then put the rest in as a cake (I got impatient) and that turned out quite nicely, I just left that in a little longer. \n\nI agree with the other reviewers, you must let them cool on the baking paper before transferring them to the rack because they will fall apart. I liked the texture - nice and chewy in the middle, harder on the outside. \n\nI'm giving it a four because I feel it's a tad sugary for my liking but the biscuits are quite nice. About them being flat - mine weren't very flat but I did add that extra cup of flour - they spread a lot so make sure you space them with big gaps in between. Yum! :)",

The first time, after reading comments about them being flat, I used half margarine/half crisco.  Cookies were a little dry then.  The next 2 times I followed the recipe EXACTLY (well, Blue Bonnet stick margarine instead of butter)and they are fabulous!  Everyone loves them.  They are not flat, and very soft, but definitely done!  Just a note, they should be dropped by Tablespoon, not teaspoon.  I have a cookie scoop that is a measured Tablespoon, works great - bake 9 minutes.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!",

I used a small size ice cream scoop to make the cookies uniform in size & I also baked a couple of 1 inch balls that I rolled up in my hands to experiment with. The ice cream scoop ones were larger & baked just right for 9 minutes on an air bake cookie sheet with a silpat. The 1 inch balls on the same sheet for 9 minutes baked up more dry. Now for the add ins. I only used 1 cup of choc. chips but I also used 1 cup of chopped up dried cherries. I was very pleased with the out come.",
