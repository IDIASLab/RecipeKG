I goofed and put 16 oz of spinach instead of 10 so to balance it out I added a can of crushed tomoates. As another posted suggested I substituded ditalini for the macaroni I also swirled in a tablespoon of butter at the end for mouth feel and sprinkled grated parmesan over each serving. This was great I will make again. Thanks Holly!",

I've been looking for a Tomato Florentine soup close to the one I had at a little bagel shop I used to work for, this one came very close, and my husband loved this! I used small shell pasta and with the condensed soup I was a little weirded out since I don't like it so I tasted the soup and added the condensed a little at a time, ended up using about 1/2 a can of the soup. Next time I'll just leave it out and use a can of tomato sauce. Thanks for the recipe.",
