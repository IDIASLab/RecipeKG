No mess or oil splatters to clean up.  I did add a couple shakes of dry ranch mix and green onions. I've also used chopped chives instead of green onions - which I prefer.  Let it sit overnight and added the chopped tomatoes before serving.  I used 2 roma tomatoes with the seeds removed first.  This will solve your problem of a runny dip.  Great with plain ruffles. Optional add ons: add a few dashes of cayenne, fresh chopped dill, a few dashes of liquid smoke, 1/2 package of softened cream cheese, garnish with chopped bacon on top, chopped chives, dashes of paprika, caramelized onions, diced pimentos (from the jar).  Try these, they enhance the dip very well.",

One suggestion to keep the dip creamy and not runny: dice your tomatoes first, and store them in the fridge on paper towels to soak up the juices. I stored the tomatoes overnight, then mixed in the tomatoes *just* before I served it. For a beautiful presentation, I served it in a \"bowl\" made of large iceberg lettuce leaves, and tossed about a 1/4 cup of diced tomatoes on top of the dip for color.",

I used 2 cups sour cream 1 cup mayo 2 lbs real bacon pieces (hormel) and dashed in a good amount of garlic pepper. I tested it with plain & roasted garlic pita chips since that's what I plan to take along to go with it and all I can say is YUM and I haven't even added the tomatoes yet. Hope it's a hit tomorrow. I'll update once I know:D Updated: This was the one recipe that had requests from at least 7 people at the party. I gave it to one person and saw them making copies on the scanner and handing them out to lots of people so I don't know how many actually took it home:D Everyone kept asking \"who made the great dip with the tomatoes & bacon in it?\" I doubled the recipe and not a bite was left. I actually saw one lady scraping the dish with a pita chip! Just wanted to add one tip: When I use real bacon pieces I put them in a dish and microwave them a few seconds to warm them just slightly. It helps bring out the bacon flavor like you would get with fresh cooked bacon. It's almost as good this way and much less messy!",
