In Finland, it is usually served as a dessert with jam on top, but we like to eat it for breakfast with pancake syrup on top as well. It is now my kids' favorite breakfast and is requested regularly.",

To me, this turned out more like a magic cake (a cake on top of custard) than anything else. It was good, though. I did use butter in place of margarine, and I would do so again. The flavor was just sweet enough, but rich and buttery. I wonder if making this more like a German pancake (where you melt the butter by placing the pan in the oven as it preheats, then adding the batter to the hot pan) would yield a slightly different result? (i.e. more \"puff\"). Regardless, it was something new to try and it was easy to  make! Thank you for the recipe!",
