I fried the tofu first so it got a crispy exterior (I then removed it and added it back in during the final cooking stages).  I also sauteed a tablespoon each of minced garlic and ginger in the center of the pan immediately before adding the sauce mixture to the vegetables.  Rather than add cayenne I put a spoonful of Hunan red chile sauce in the sauce mixture.  Finally, I stirred in some chopped green onions and sesame oil and squeezed on some lime juice immediately before serving.  Oh, and (as others have suggested) crunchy all-natural peanut butter adds great texture to this dish.  The final product had plenty of spicy-tangy-garlicky-peanutty sauce to coat all the tofu and vegetables and flavor the rice.  The vegetables were nicely crisp-tender when I stir-fried them on high heat for the recommended time.  Pretty quick and simple -- I'll definitely make this again.",

I freeze tofu first, then thaw it out and squeeze it gently to get as much fluid out as possible. THEN I dice it up. This process gives tofu a much more cohesive and \"meaty\" texture, and also causes it to marinate and brown more effectively. Try this recipe again and see how it comes out. Also, if molasses doesn't suit you, try honey, or even add some ginger.",

I also browned the tofu (with some fresh grated ginger and minced garlic) before adding the rest of the veggies. Other than that I followed the recipe almost exactly adding some crushed red pepper to the sauce. Next time I will also brown some onions along with the tofu and I will probably use only 1/4 cup of peanut butter. I will add some vegetable broth as well so the sauce isn't quite as thick. I think it's a keeper with just a few tweaks. I served over brown rice which was good.",

I was skeptical about the sauce - it seemed thin - but it thickened up nicely when I added it to the hot wok.  I finished with a squeeze of lime juice (had seen that in a peanut sauce recipe on this website) and thought it added a real nice touch to this dish.  Overall an excellent dish and one that I will definitely make again!",

I found that it made the sauce too thick and my tofu never got browned. The second time I cooked the tofu separately in a little vegetable oil so it got nice and golden and a little crispy. I then sauteed the vegetables separately so they were crisp tender and combined everything in a bowl -- with whole wheat rotini -- and ladled the sauce on top. That was great. I also used chili sauce instead of the cayenne and added a little sesame oil to give it an even nuttier flavor. Great recipe though. I will be making it again.
