Like many others I made some alterations to the recipe and I encourage people to do so as the original seems boring. I sauteed some onions several cloves of garlic (minced) and a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a pan while the pasta was cooking. I also added in some broccoli and sauteed that for a bit just until it started to get a bit of brown on the edges from the garlic and oil. I added this mixture to the cooked (and drained) penne pasta and stirred. Lastly I added some garlic salt and lots of shredded parmesean cheese (probably 1/2 cup or so)! This was important for flavoring. It was fabulous!! I ate it with \"Angela's Easy Breaded Chicken\" which I also got from AllRecipes; eat with a slice of lemon on the side (I love lemons). For a new cook like me this recipe was simple and enjoyable. Thanks so much!",
