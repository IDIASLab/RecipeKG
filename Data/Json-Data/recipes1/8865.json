I didn't have tomatoes with green chilies, but I had some salsa, so I added some of this along with the canned tomatoes.  I also used about 1 1/2 cups of grated cheddar cheese (some mixed with the soup, some sprinkled on top of the casserole).  I crushed some nacho cheese doritos and sprinkled on top of the casserole and baked at 350 for about 25 mins.  Oh, and I mixed in some Mrs. Dash, dried onion, and seasoned salt, because it was kinda bland (hence, the 4 stars).  We all loved it! (family of 6, ages 3 - 39 years old)",

And although I do not know where she originally got her recipe from (it's all in her head), I do know that this is the closest recipe I have found and it looks IDENTICAL to the way hers turns out! My mouth waters just looking at it!  She uses Velveeta cheese, Rotel tomatoes, onion, green pepper, Cream of Mushroom soup, and thawed, uncooked diced chicken. She boils the chicken and uses the same water to cook her noodles to al dente and drains out enough water to where it just barely covers the chicken and pasta. The cheese makes this dish really really sticky/thick and the starchy water helps thin it out some. While the pasta and chicken boil, cube your cheese. This will help it melt more evenly. Then she adds her peppers, onions, rotel tomatoes, mushroom soup and cubed cheese. Once it is all melted and evenly mixed, we eat!",

I think the value in the recipe is that it's quick to put together and kids will probably like it if they have a taste for processed foods like most kids do. However as one could probably guess by the ingredient list it does taste pretty much like queso mixed with spaghetti. I guess I prefer to REALLY love something that is this unhealthy.:) So for me too much like junk food to stand as a main dish. 4 stars because kids like it fine quick to prepare and fine for a once in awhile meal. I do think there are better fresher chx spaghetti recipes but they do take longer to prepare.",

It gave it that extra layer of flavor so it didn't taste so pantryish. Next time I will probably use shell pasta. I have made a different version of chicken spaghetti which was very involved(boiling a whole chicken and then picking through it cutting up peppers waiting for it to bake in the oven). This is much easier and tastes just as good. Even though it was a similar recipe this didn't leave me disappointed as the other drawn out one did. I don't know why anyone would take time to make it \"gourmet\" when you are just going to pour cream of mushroom all over it anyway. Great weeknight meal. Served with garlic bread as the submitter suggested. Next time I might add some shrimp with the chicken for a change of pace.",
