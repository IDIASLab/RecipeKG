To fix this recipe you will need at least two jars of pasta sauce or use a large can of tomato sauce, add olive oil, and spices. Put the sauce at the bottom of the pan, and add sauce over each layer and on top. Chop your veggies very fine and small.  Bake at 350 cover tightly with foil and bake for an hour. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.  This recipe will be fine if you do this.",
