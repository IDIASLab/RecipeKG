All three times it has turned out wonderfully. If you are looking for a unique way to serve it try this: CAKE IN A COFFEE MUG Mix your favorite microwave cake combo. Spray a coffee mug with cooking spray. For mugs that hold a 1 cup fluid capacity add 1/2 cup batter. Microwave for 1 min 40 seconds. Let sit aprox 5 minutes in or out of microwave. Great in the mug but easy to pop out as well. (makes 10 & 1/2 mugs worth) For 1 1/2 cup or larger capacity mugs use 3/4 cup batter and microwave for 2 min and let sit for 5. (Makes 7 mugs worth). Note the first time I tried the regular recipe I used a silacone pan but not a bundt pan. It turned out ok but was a little gooey in the center. I didn't have that problem when I used the bundt pan the next two times. It's not a problem with the mugs as they are so small.",

I didn't have canned pie filling and I had a Lemon supreme cake mix not a yellow. So...remembering another cake recipe from years ago and knowing that I would need to get the liquid/texture combination correct to make this work I took a risk and used a 15oz. container of Ricotta Cheese and increased the amount of applesauce to total 26oz. of wet ingredients. I used a silicone bundt pan and it came out fantastic! I suspect you must use a high-watt microwave as baking I've tried in a smaller micro I had several years ago did not come out well. Also the ricotta is a great way to add protein to baked goods and it probably improved the texture of the cake. The lemon flavor had a real kick to it which might be enjoyed more by those who mentioned the yellow cake being too bland for them? I made a simple lemon glaze for it as you see in the pic and it disappeared! Thanks for this recipe!",

(The almond flavor was really good with the chocolate and cherries.) I baked it in a soft-sided silicone bundt pan and the cake came out easily.
