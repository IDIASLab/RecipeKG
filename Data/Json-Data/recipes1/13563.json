The only change I made was to use the jellied cranberry sauce instead of whole berry. The topping was very tasty but I found it to be lumpy...I would suggest beating the cream cheese with the sugar and lemon juice until fluffy and then folding in the sour cream I will do this next time I make this and I will also put the jello part in a bowl instead of a mold.",
