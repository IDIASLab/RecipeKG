I divided the recipe in half as if it turned out really bad I did not want to have wasted good food.  First I used a gluten free mix which included bean flour. Second I used soy milk versus water and increased the quantity to one and a half cups.  Third I used olive oil and increased the quantity to two tablespoons.  Fourth I doubled the baking powder.  I used aluminum free baking powder.  IT TURNED OUT GREAT!!!  No more super expensive gluten free breads for me.",

I'm going to try it with only whole wheat flour also. We use this for everything peanut butter and jelly with meatballs etc. It's WONDERFUL!! My husband said this is the closest alternative to yeast bread and he likes it just the same! It's not too biscuit-like or dry or anything. Really great! Oh and as a dessert with butter and sugar on top!:D",

Also mixed in  seasonings (1/2 tsp each of sage, basil, oregano, rosemary). Baking Powder Substitute: for each teaspoon, give 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (aluminum-free), and whisked 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice (best) or white vinegar in with water. Used agave nectar instead of honey. Wonderful, moist, dense (but not packed) texture. Puffed up nicely in a glass 9x9 dish. Turned out soft with a slightly firm crust. Excellent with your favorite dip (we like hummus) or topping (icing, yum!), or fold in your favorite filler. We've used jam, dried fruit, veggies sauteed in water, or just some of your favorite seasonings. Quickest bread loaf I've ever made! This yeastless bread goes on the menu! Oh so versatile! Oh so tasty!",
