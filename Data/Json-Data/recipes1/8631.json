I used a red bell pepper instead of pimento peppers, and used fresh seranos as well.  One person asked me for the recipe.  The plate got cleaned up fast even though I made enough for 35 people.  Used fresh Trader Joes salsa, and decorated with cherry tomatoes and parsley for a stunning platter!  Thanks for telling me to double the cream.  I did, or else it would have never been enough.  Next time, I will double the rest of the ingredients as well.  Made 8 12\" tortillas, spread thin.\r\nI have made this over and over and over from requests from friends at pot lucks to the point that I am tired of making it, but all my vegetarian friends love this a lot! And, it is never enough!  They always ask me to make more.  I usually use twice the amount recommended for the number of people attending... and it is the first dish to go.  I serve it with fresh salsa from trader joes, very nicely presented in a chip and dip platter. A little time consuming if you are making that much, but worth it for the folks that love it.  Try it! I gave it only 4 stars initially (I thought it was good but not stunning), but everyone has loved it so much, that I must update to 5 stars.",

For all of you out there who have a problem with the oozing, after mixing all the ingredients together, refrigerate for about one hour before spreading on tortillas.  If the mixture starts going soft again, stop and refrigerate some more before spreading again, I found this helps alot, especailly for those of you who like it to be thick.  DELICIOUS!",

Frank's Red Hot Pepper Sauce, 3/4 c. fresh cilantro, chopped, 2 c. finely shredded cheddar cheese, 4 (24oz.) pkgs. sliced ham and 40 tortillas.  Spread 6 T. of mixture on each tortilla.

Although I did not use NEARLY that much pepper sauce (I did it the smarter way added a few dashes at a time and mixed until I could taste the heat that we prefer). But as I was \"taste-testing\" - I thought to myself that they were kinda \"boring\" (other than the spice attack on your tongue). I made one tortilla roll-up and still thought they were boring SO I added a little taco seasoning (homemade also from this site) and mixed it in. A little better but now my taco spice addition reminded me of those 7-layer taco dips instead of a roll-up-with a kick. These are okay but it is unlikely that these will ever show up on my appetizer tray. Thanks anyways!!",
