They sounded wonderful but I thought they would be more well received (in my family) if I mixed the apple butter in and then baked them. They were EXCELLENT! I should have made more - my husband raved and raved about them. He can't wait until I make them again. Great with a cup of coffee! Thanks Kevin!",

The result a moist cake like cookie that reminded us of pecan sandies - will definitely make again - thank you Kevin.",

When the mixture was ready for baking it was really crumbly - too crumbly to form into balls -- so I added back in the leftover egg white. The cookies turned out good. They baked for about 20 minutes and were crunchy but not crumbly. They have a good taste. They look a lot like pecan sandies when they're done. My hubby mistook the crushed pecans for oatmeal and declined my offer to try one. Something that might be worth trying is to roll these in crushed pecans before baking.",
