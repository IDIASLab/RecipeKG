All of this we added to the soup when we added the sausage and kale. My family hates kale no matter how I cook it and even they said this was okay.

I started by cutting up and browning the sausage in the soup pan. Removed and set aside, then boiled the potatoes in only 8 cups water with 2 chicken bullion cubes. I cut back the butter to 1 tbl. when I'm using real sausage (as opposed to turkey sausage) b/c I figure there's enough fat already. Any sausage will do, I've used hot and mild Italian. Once the potatoes are tender, I don't bother to reserve the liquid. Just take a hand masher and mash them in the water. I didn't use as much kale as the recipe calls for, and I also threw in some swiss and rainbow chard. This is a new favorite in our house!\n\nUpdate: Trying to get away from bullion cubes (have you looked at the ingredients?!) so I'm now using 4 c. homemade chicken stock and 4 c. water, plus a little more salt. Last batch had kale, chard and turnip greens, plus a few turnips mixed in with the potatoes.",

I split the kielbasa lengthwise and browned it in the same pan in which I later boiled the potatoes.  I think this made my version a little richer and more flavorful (and gave a browner color).  I also added a ham-flavor bouillon cube to the cooking liquid. These two things made it quite flavorful and salty enough.  The really great thing about this Kielbasa Kale Stew is its versatility.  It seems to accomodate a wide variety of different ingredients and still come out wonderfully.  I added turnip greens (and a few little turnip pieces too) in addition to kale.  I also upped the sausage to 1 lb (since it comes in 1 lb. packages!) and only used 4 large potatoes. Thanks for the tasty, inexpensive, and easy recipe!",
