I lived in Australia for many years and it is a common soup there. They call it Pumpkin Soup and you can get it at most restaurants and diners. Here;s the recipe I use:  1 large butternut squash peeled and cubed 1 large sweet onion peeled and diced 1 can chicken broth 1 can eveporated milk additional milk to thin it out nutmeg  Put the squash, onion and chicken broth in a soup pot and bring to a boil. Simmer until the squash id well done...about 15 minutes. Add evaporated milk and mash with a potato masher or whiz with a hand held stick blender. If it's too thick add some regular milk until it's the consistency you want. Add a dash of nutmeg. Serve with a crusty bread.   I just made some 2 nights ago and used a new chicken broth that made it even better than before. It was College Inn Culinary Broth Thai Coconut Curry. I have to get more so I always have some in the cupboard.",
