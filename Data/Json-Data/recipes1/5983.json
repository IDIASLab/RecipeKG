A few things I tweeked with this recipe: I made the vinaigrette the night before using a hand blender to really get things combined. I used a combination of white wine vinegar and balsamic vinegar. I used Splenda instead of sugar (1-2 packets). I also added 1 t. of grated parmesan cheese to the vinaigrette. The next day I roasted 3 oz. of pine nuts. I combined the tomatoes and vinaigrette about 2 hours before serving letting it sit out at room temperature. Just before serving I added the roasted pine nuts and some shredded parmesan cheese. It looked really pretty in a white casserole dish. I m making it again tonight for my family and guests. It s a great way to enjoy (and use up!) those cherry tomatoes fresh from the garden.",

I did make a few changes to this recipe but in my opinion, it only enhanced the flavor.  I only used about 1 cup of tomatoes and about 3 Tbls of olive oil rather than vegetable oil. I used balsamic vinegar instead of cider and left out the sugar.  Finally, right before I served this, I sprinkled some parmesan cheese over and mixed it well.  This gave it an outstanding flavor and I will certainly make it again with these changes.  Thanks for sharing.",
