My family has been making it that way for years and it's the most requested cake we make. Also we double the topping and make it in a big jelly roll pan and use a butter yellow cake mix. It's delicious and making it this way it keeps well in the in the fridge for days.",

The whipped topping should be refrigerated not frozen -- you just have to make sure that your cake has cooled before frosting with the topping/pudding mixture. Follow the recipe and you will not be disappointed! I bake a lot of fancy cakes from complicated recipes but my kids continue to request this one really often. It's that good!",

You could easily get away with 1 package of pudding and 1/2 the cool whip bc it made a ton of topping. I wasn't too disappointed as I just ate the rest! The only thing I did differently was bake some shredded coconut and add it on top for appearance! Thanks for the instant classic!",
