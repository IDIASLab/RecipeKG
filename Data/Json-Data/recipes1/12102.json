I also STEAMED my own SPINACH and added MUSHROOMS and fresh diced TOMATOES (which gave a juicy burst of flavor I'll add more next time). I couldn't find artichoke hearts canned so I didn't bother. I also used ITALIAN 5 CHEESE BLEND to give it more parmesan flavor. I SAUTED fresh ONION and GARLIC that I had on hand and also put those in instead. I also didn't have paprika. So..with the changes I made....I LOVED IT and my family enjoyed it as well. I will definatly make again with my alterations and maybe throw in some chicken for the carnivore in the family.
