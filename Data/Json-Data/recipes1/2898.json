Recommendation: place 2 sugars at top of jar as the best way to mix cookie dough is sugar and butter then add egg other liquid and then dry ingredients. Also with wheat germ you must keep jar in fridge so advise giftee to take jar out of fridge in advance of fixing room temp is best for getting sugar out of the top etc.",
