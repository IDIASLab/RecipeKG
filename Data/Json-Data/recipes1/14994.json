I baked in small tasting bowls, served with fresh oranges (sliced tomatoes or a small salad would be nice also) for what turned out to be a really tasty lunch\u2026SURPRISINGLY tasty I\u2019d like to say.  Recipe submitter says this takes well to additions and alterations, so I made a few based on what I had.  I added a little chopped red red bell pepper for a pop of color, switched cream of celery soup to cream of mushroom, and gave it a sprinkle of Gruyere-Swiss cheese. We\u2019re pepper lovers, so it also got a healthy grind of black peppercorns.  I think the single ingredient that makes this distinctive is that small amount of soy sauce, just enough.  I know there are people who turn their nose up at canned soups, but it certainly works in this recipe.  Definitely  will make this one again.",
