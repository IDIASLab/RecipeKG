So, a lucky accident occurred thats worth another try! \nI dumped the entire thing, marinade and all, into a deep, stainless saute pan and sauted everything.  I lidded the mixture for the first 3/4 of the cooking time (to ensure that the meat was cooked and the veggies soft).  Following this, I increased the heat and removed the lid, thus boiling and thickening the remaining juices.  The result was delicious!  What was originally the marinade became a thick delicious sauce.  The pork was ridiculously tender, and the greek flavor was prevalent throughout.  \nThe only thing I will be careful about next time is saltiness.  I added the soy, as directed, but then also seasoned the dish and mine came out just a bit too salty.",

I LOVE this recipe. It is absolutely delicious. I do use low sodium soy, so maybe others find it too salty if they don't. That's well and good. Have some common sense and taste your marinade before you add any meat! If it tastes salty, add more lemon juice and oil. Problem solved, my friends. I marinate red peppers and red onions right in with this. The marinade makes for a lovely caramelization, and this goes splendidly with Tzatziki Sauce I. I serve this on pita with cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, tzatziki and feta cheese. Mmmm. Can't go wrong. This also works well with chicken. Please don't listen to the nay-sayers. It really is delicious. Would I lead you astray? ;)",

We also served it on warm pita bread with cucumber sauce called Tzatziki sauce on this website and submitted by Dinah but I added 1/4 c. of mayo to keep it thicker. It turned out wonderful. I also topped the sandwiches with diced tomatoes. I used 2 lbs. of pork tenderloin (Hormel Always Tender brand) instead of 4 and it made five skewers of meet! And I even ommitted the green peppers. This was plenty for sandwiches. I still made the same amount of marinade and I'm glad I did. The marinade doesn't make that much and it was perfect for two pounds. I added a Greek seasoning found in supermarkets to both the marinade and the sauce instead of salt and pepper. Can't remember the name but it's in a yellow with red shaker container. It's a staple in our house. Thanks Abby for a real \"keeper.\"",
