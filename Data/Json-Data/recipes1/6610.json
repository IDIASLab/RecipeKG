And I baked them for 10 minutes prior to adding the toppings in a 12 inch cake pan and 12 inch cast iron skillet, that were both olive oiled WELL, and dusted with yellow cornmeal. They came out of the pan very easy onto the cutting board. \nIt was easy to make this. Just have to adjust weather and flour consistency to the stickiness of the dough. Some days need less, some days need MUCH more. Adding about a 1/2 cup grated parmasean cheese to the dough is great with the seasonings. I never roll the dough out, I just use my hands and flatten it in the bottom of the pans, working up the sides Also sometimes string cheese rolled in the crust makes the kids happy too.",

I just melted butter garlic and poured it on the pizza and added cheese, it was a great addition to my italian dinner without the hassle of baking a loaf of bread.

I kneaded it with the dough hook on my stand mixture and left the dough slightly sticky to acheive a more tender crust. I rose beautifully and was very easy to stretch into two medium pizzas. I baked the pizzas on a pizza stone preheated for an hour at 500 degrees. They baked in about 8 minutes. The bottom of the crust was very crunchy (but not burnt) and the edges were nice and soft. I've had problems with tough crusts in the past, but this one was nice and tender. I will make it again!",

I used my pizza stone and prebaked the crust for about 10 mins. at 325. then I put the toppings on. The crust needs a little something so i brushed it the second day with an mixture of olive oil and garlic powder. It rises amazing! and it tastes like real pizza crust. My husband loved it and I think from now on I will make my own dough because it is sooo easy and much cheaper than buying the frozen ones. I can't wait to make it again! Thanks JAY!\r\nAnna\r\n",
