I fixed this for my large, picky family for Thanksgiving.  There were no leftovers!:-) Here's what I changed. I made 2 batches. In one, I added 1/4 cup of water rather than 1/2 cup. That was perfect. In the other batch I didn't add any water at all, and it was a little drier than I like.  So cut the water in half.  Also, I tossed the apples in the cinnamon and sugar mixture, and I added some nutmeg to that mixture.  I think that's what made the apples soooo perfect. Lastly, I doubled the crust recipe and put a layer on top and on bottom.  Yum!!!  I used 6 large Granny Smith's.  I won't change a THING about this recipe next time I fix it, which if my family has anything to say about it, will be tomorrow!:-) \n11-13-06 I made this again for like the 5th time. It's still good, but I think next time I will try to cut the butter into the crust rather than melt it. My crust is never \"crumbly\" like I like on a crisp recipe.  Still a 5-star no doubt!!!",

Leave out the water, add 1/4 teaspoon of Nutmeg to the apples, double the crust recipe, add 1 1/2 c. chopped pecans to the crust, and it comes out perfect. Remember to use baking apples (preferably granny smiths) for this, as red delicious will be more sweet and therefore need less sugar. Good vanilla ice cream provides all the moisture you would be missing from the water, and a food processor does wonders for taking the work out of slicing the apples. Now just to find a good butter rum sauce recipe :)",

I made mine in a 9 x 13 pan and doubled the topping as another reviewer suggested to cover. Perfect. I mixed my apples up with the flour/cinnamon mixture - this draws out the juices and eliminates the need for the extra water. I did not add the water to the apples.  My only mistake was I sliced my apples too thin and because they were too ripe some of it came out more like applesauce, but that was my own error.  Everyone loved it! I know you are considering other Apple Crisp recipes here but MAKE THIS ONE!",

It is important to follow the steps and not deviate from them (i.e. don't mix up All the ingredients at once and throw it over the apples as you may be able to get away with in other crisp recipes)\r\nThe recipie was great. the water factor wasn't a factor for me. it turned out to be a very nice thick juice that accented the dish nicely.\r\nA word of caution when using this or any apple crisp recipie.  THE TYPE OF APPLES DO MATTER. I made this twice. Once with Red Delicious apples. these apples are not the greatest to use as they are often soft and bland. the recipe was great but the apples lacked.  I then used Granny Smith green sour apples.  This made All the difference! Do not be afraid to use sour apples. Keep in mind you are using two cups of sugar in this recipie and it will be quite sweet.  It simply comes down to the need for a hard and sour or at the very least sharp tasting apple to counter the sugar and even the flavor out. It will taste much better. Do not use soft or bland tasting apples, and do not overcook as the apples will turn mushy if you overcook.  If you fear overcooking then cut your apple thicker.  If you like the very thin slices of apple then you need to you a very hard, fresh, tart apple.  I do not suggest using Red Delicious apples. I also addeed a pinch of nutmeg.",

It is my favorite way to get rid of an apple surplus (I ususally use about 7 good sized apples of mixed variety, minus what I snack on while I make it).  The only things I do differently are:\n \n1) I use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white for the apple mixture. \n2)I add fresh ground nutmeg, vanilla extract, and often raisins. \n3)I omit the h20 and \n4)I always add a heaping spoonful of gourmet butterscotch caramel ice cream topping to the apple mix-TRUST ME on this one!  \n\nIn the begining, I had a hard time with my crumble mix being 'crumbly' until I figured out to lightly press it down into the bowl, chill it for at least 30m and then break it up with a fork.  Letting the butter in the mix re-harden really makes a BIG difference in the final crumble factor.  Also, you must use real butter, margarine won't have the same effect for this recipe.  I'll often assemble this earlier in the day and leave it in the frige, then just before dinner, break up the crumble, top and bake while we eat.  I always serve with vanilla bean ice cream and have ALWAYS gotten rave reviews with this one.",

                "reviewBody": "First I made with(10)fresh peaches. Was WAY too sweet for our taste. Second time, I used semi- tart apples with only 1/4 of the white sugar. We still COULDN'T eat without a giant glass of milk, or the suggested ice cream. All I could taste was the \"sweet\";not much of the fresh fruit flavor or the wonderful cinnamon.The topping was about a 1/4 inch thick in a 9/13 dish. Also, way too sweet for us. I will omit all, but a sprinkling, of the white sugar, add HALF of the brown sugar, next time. If you like it 'BIG TIME' SWEET, this recipe AS IS, is for you! If you like the fresh fruit taste more, omit most of the white sugar and half the brown. Also, you can get away with half the butter if you \"cut\" it in evenly with a pastry cutter or a fork. It still comes out crispy and not too dry and is healthier.",
