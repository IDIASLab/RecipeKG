Anyway I did not add any rosemary since I was after a healthy bread and don't really care for rosemary other than in stew:-) I got a dense rather hard loaf of bread. I will try it again though with some dough improver. I liked that it included Quinoa flour since I'm trying to find ways to use that.",
