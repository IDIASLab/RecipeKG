Would make a great use for leftover quinoa, and is a great make-ahead idea for busy weekdays. I needed more than 1 tablespoon green onion for garnish, and drizzled more sriracha over the bowls before serving, personal preference. The eggs definitely don\u2019t need 5 minutes to cook. This was tasty and I would make it again.",
