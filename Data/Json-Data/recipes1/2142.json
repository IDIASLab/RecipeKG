I then put a thin layer of sweetened COCONUT on top of the chopped pecans, then the cream cheese layer.  To the cream cheese mixture I used TWO PKGS of cream cheese (to make it more cream cheesey and less sweet) less powder sugar probably 2 1/2 cups (since the coconut was sweet) AND I added ALMOND extract (2 TBLBS) to the cream cheese mixture. Let me tell you - it was GOOD !!!!! My daughter (who mostly likes chocolate) LOVED IT!!!!  Will DEFINITELY MAKE THIS ONE AGAIN! THANK YOU !",

I cut the corner of the bag, piped the jam on top, swirled with a knife along the top to make it pretty. That was fantastic!!!!",

I have \"tweaked\"this recipe some and found that if you use 12 ounces of cream cheese, and one cup of confectioners sugar (and the eggs as previously instructed) and about 2 tbsp. milk to make it a little thinner it tastes more like cream cheese filling and less like pure sugar. on a related note, when you mix the cake/crust, if you pile the sticky mess together, and dust with powdered sugar it turns into a very soft dough that is easily handled, dont work the dough, just dust lightly and pat gently and it will become a nice dough ball, this makes it easier to push into the pan as opposed to trying to spread the gooey mess. I hope these tips help, other than that, this is an incredible dessert, and easily \"tweeked\" to your taste",
