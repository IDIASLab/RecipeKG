So if I were to use extra pineapple and coconut next time I would cut back on the sugar... honestly it is probably better just as written. It was also too much filling for a regular crust I should have used a deep dish. I think the mixture would be good on top of a sweetened cream cheese base to make tropical bar cookies too yum!",
