I did about 5 TBSP of butter because I doubled the mushrooms added 1 extra clove of garlic 1/2 tsp. garlic salt 1/2 tsp. season salt 1/2 tsp pepper 1/2 tsp basil and the stated amount of onion. I subsituted 1 cup of half and half and 1 cup of chicken stock for the milk. I served on top of steak and red potatoes. The taste turned out great the only downside was it was too thick. I only used 2 TBSP of flour but the sauce still turned out like a thick gravy. Next time I won't add any flour at all. Thanks for this recipe and thanks to all those who gave their suggestions as well!",
