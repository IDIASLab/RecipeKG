The thing I like best about this recipe is the fact that this remains semi-soft and creamy in the freezer, unlike other homemade ice creams which always turn rock hard.  I plan on using this recipe a lot, and I think it is easily customizable to make whatever flavor you want.  I already have plans to add chocolate, strawberries...  All sorts of things!  Thanks for a great recipe!",

Followed the recipe exactly, and the texture was rich and smooth,  not rock-hard like most ice creams I make.  I made this for my husband, and pledged not to eat any, since I'm low-carbing.  However, this ice cream was soooooo good, that all my low-carb plans went out the window until the entire container was gone.  Highly recommend.",
