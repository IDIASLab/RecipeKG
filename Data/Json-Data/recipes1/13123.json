It was still crumbly (dough pulling away from the chips) and when baked grainy in texture-ugh! I added more water and reworked the dough. Then the cookie had more of a cookie dough consistency and baked nicely. The cookies spread and had a much better chewy texture!!! I really liked the adjusted cookie recipe. The combinations are endless Here are my changes/recommendations: Devil s food cake mix (with pudding in the mix) white chocolate chips 3 Tbsp water baked at 350 for 10 minutes(not 7)",

I used devils food cake mix and white chocolate chunks and let me tell you - these are out of this world! To be  so easy these were very good! I think those that might not be getting good results might want to change cake mixes.  I used a mix that had pudding in it. Thanks for the post! I am going to try different variations for sure!",

My husband says that they are better with just the white chocolate but I like these! I still have a batch in the oven now! I do have to cook them for almost 15 min to get them to the point that they don't fall apart when you pick them up. I will defiantly make these often!!! THANKS!",
