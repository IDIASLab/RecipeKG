The ingredients would be (and have been) fine for a chicken recipe, but with ground beef the taste was pretty darn bad. After wasting over a pound of meat, we had to resort to popping some Ellio's frozen pizza in the oven so we hadn't upped the gas bill for nothing.  Now we know: Never try to incorporate Eastern ingredients with ground beef.  It's an awkward combo.  If you're thinking of making this, keep one thing in mind: peanuts in your hamburger.",

The loaves were very most inside but a little hard or dry on top. The next day I made a glaze for the tops of the left over loaves. Staying with the flavors in the recipe I melted a 1/4c. apricot preserves (I did not have apple) with 1t of peanut butter 1t ketchup curry and garlic powder to taste. When reheated with the glaze the top was nice and soft. Next time I will add the glaze to the top during the last 5 minutes of cooking. Will definelty make this again.",
