My 2 and 4 year-olds love it and eat more shrimp than their parents! It is also a big hit with company, and easy to prepare. I make this with frozen or fresh shrimp and use my indoor electric grill if the weather is not good for outside grilling. Try it with a salad, baked potato, and garlic bread. You will not be disappointed!!!",

Instead of tomato sauce, I used a whole can of diced tomatoes, doubled the garlic, more basil, 1/4 cup sweet chilli sauce, 1 tblsn of red wine vinegar, 1/4 cup oil and pulsed the lot in my food processor. Verrryyy nice.",

It had to be scrapped, the grill allows some of the seasonings to air out especially the garlic and adds a great taste that can not be replicated on the stove.",

After reading other reviews, I used the largest shrimp I could find, replaced the tomato sauce with chili sauce, upped the cayenne pepper, marinated them for two hours and then grilled.  People were raving about them and calling to each other to come try them.  Definitely a success.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!!",

No need to change a thing, unless you feel some compelling desire to do so. Just enough flavor and seasoning--enough to be noticeable, but in a way that enhances the shrimp rather than overpowering its own wonderful and delicate flavor. This is an example of how using a few simple but flavorful and fresh ingredients is usually best. ",

The second time, we doubled the marinade and then cooked the shrimp and marinade in a skillet and poured it over rice.  The heat made the sauce pretty thin so now I reserve 1/2 cup marinade and add one tablespoon cornstarch to it, then combine it all in the skillet.  *TIP: One thing I do different is I only use a quarter or a third of the olive oil called for.  It doesn't really add anything and it just kinda separates into this oily layer floating on top, not really blending with the tomato sauce.  Now I usually quadruple the marinade (with the exception of the olive oil) when using the marinade as a sauce.  We've also made this with small pieces of chicken and it is very good!

It's the closest I've come to the best shrimp I've ever had in my life, which was at a Cozumel beach bar/grill and the owner was NOT coming out with the recipe.  This makes me fantasize a little less about HIS shrimp.  :)\r\nADDENDUM 2/16/03----------Still LOVE this recipe, and I'm delighted to find that it turned out great after just two minutes in my George Foreman grill.
