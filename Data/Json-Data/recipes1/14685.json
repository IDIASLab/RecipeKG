Although I followed the ingredients exactly I made it a little differently: I tossed the thinnest spears in the pack into boiling salted water removed them as soon as they turned bright green and then immersed them in iced water for a couple of mins. I then basically just heated them through with the soy/ginger cashews. They turned out perfect! Thanks!",

I really liked this dish. i had never made it before and i didn t change anything except i didnt have a wok so I just used a large pan. My uncle doesnt like asparagus but he liked this one!!! I thought it was great and my family is having me make it for them now!! I loved it and I ope this came in handy for you!!!",

I used the stated amount of oil just used a slotted spoon to take the asparagus out of the pan and left the excess behind. I am going to serve this dish at my next dinner party and when everyone is raving about it I am going to smile and take all the credit. Sandy...you are my new best friend...and girl you can cook!",
