Although I didn't measure the peanut butter, just put a huge spoonful of it in the milk. Oh, and a hint: It's much easier to mix the milk/PB-mix and spread it over the crust if you heat it in the microwave for 15 or 30 seconds. Then in blends really easily and it's pretty simple to smooth over the base. I also pressed down on the top crust a little to make sure it would not fall apart. Wonderful! I lined the 8\" pan with foil, sprayed it, and it was simple to remove and cut the bars. Thanks, Sue, I LOVE this recipe!",

I didn't measure the choc chips just added to coat the pan. Also added a handful or 2 of white chips. I didn't have all the peanut butter it called for which didn't matter. The peanut butter and cond. milk aren't hard to mix at all..just a little elbow grease.:) The recipe calls for you to allow them to cool before cutting them but I had to try them out of the oven and I think they would be awesome warm with vanilla ice cream! I will definately keep this recipe. Thank you so much!!",

Never fails to amaze me how people will rate a recipe less stars because they are 'rich' or 'too sweet'; all one has to do is look at ingredients to realize yes they have ingredients that produce a rich dessert bar but oh so good. Didn't have a problem mixing the milk and pb-just a few whips with the wisk and it was incorporated. Used a glass pan and no sticking at all; 30 min. was perfect. TIP to avoid browning of morsels or pb mixture refrain from spreading to the edges of pan. I had no problems. thanks for this quick and easy recipe. love it.",
