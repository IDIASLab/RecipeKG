Did as recipe except I used pecans and soft brown sugar. Gorgeous bread wonderful fruity sweetness (glad of little sugar usage). Good warm but better after total cool down love it plain or with butter or whipped cream/cream cheese. Better use finer chopped/sliced fruits & nuts makes for neater cutting else they tend to crumble. If prefer chunky or chewy dried dates then I'd boil them for 10-15 min to soften. Adaptable recipe sub all dates or all figs or raisins or mixed very good. Thanks much Corwynn.",
