I really think something is wrong with this receipe.  I think the cream cheese and sugar should be beaten separtely and the whip cream whipped until stiff in a separate bowl, and then after the whipped cream is stiff add it to the cream cheese mixture. would like your comment",

I always use a 9x13 pan for this, and the crumb mixture is just the perfect amount.\n\nThis easy and delicious recipe too me 28 minutes to make, and I plan to use this as a base for a recipe I've been concocting in my mind.",

I thought that this would be good for hot weather so that the oven doesn't have to be turned on. However this is not something that can sit out for even a 1/2 hour IMO. I would think that gelatin jello or maybe even instant pudding would add to the stability or maybe the dreamwhip solution some have mentioned. Bottom line is the flavor was good only change I made was a little vanilla and a bit more sugar. UPDATE I had some leftover so I stuck it in the freezer then pulled it out 2 days later. Once it completely thawed in the fridge the texture was better and the flavor too - now I' m not sure if it was the freezing or if ageing - maybe try making this more like 2 days in advance and perhaps storing in the freezer a bit. I ll give this one another whirl. PS - I served the cherries on the side did not top with them thought it would be too soft to hold them originally.",

Although most of the cakes I make take 2-3 days to finish, I was asked to make something last minute for a collegue's birthday who loves Blueberry Cheesecake.  The basis for this recipe was very good, but I did change some things as suggested by other reviewers.  I doubled the cream cheese and increased the white sugar to 3/4 cup.  I also whipped the cream cheese with all the ingredients EXCEPT the heavy cream which I whipped separately until stiff and folded it into the cream cheese mixture.  I also used Tyler Florence's recipe for Blueberry Topping.  Since this cake was a surprise, it sat in the pan in my car from 6:30 am until 2 pm (cold temperatures here in NY).  Not only did this cake unmold perfectly, it kept its form beautifully.  It was the rave and everyone requested the recipe.  Good Job, Thank you!",
