I only used a tablespoon of melted butter and thought that it was plenty to give it a nice look and crunch. My only issue was the cranberries were so tart especially since the bread isn't very sweet. I don't have any cream cheese but I bet that would tone down the tartness a bit. I'll make this again and use dried cranberries instead which I've added to regular beer bread before.",
