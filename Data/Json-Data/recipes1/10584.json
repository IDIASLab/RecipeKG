I needed a quick appetizer with ingredients I had on hand (boyfriend forgot to mention his buddies were coming over for the afternoon!). I decided to make individual ones, so there would be no cutting or mess involved. I think I might lower the oven temp. a little because the bottoms got pretty brown, while the insides were not fully cooked yet. I softened a block of cream cheese, then added 1 1/2 tsp dill weed, and a few shakes of garlic salt and mixed it all together. Then I just spread it on the thin end of the triangle and rolled them up to make little pockets. This one is going in my appetizer rotation!",
