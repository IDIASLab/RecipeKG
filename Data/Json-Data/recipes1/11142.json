I initially tried it because I was looking for a special recipe to make into a cookie that was similar to those puffy mint candies that you pop in your mouth and they melt into a fine sweet minty powder. This recipe worked perfectly! I added 1 tsp of peppermint extract a tiny bit of pink food color and some crushed candy canes. They were great!!! Thanks for a great recipe and thanks mizliz for posting the picture that helped me find it again!",
