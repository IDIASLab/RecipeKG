Didn't have shallots so used 3 parts minced onion to one part minced garlic and used majoram instead of tarragon because I didn't have tarragon. I was concerned she might not like the dressing because of her aversion to mustard but I cut it back a little and she didn't even know it was there. Other reviewers said the posted dressing measurements made only one serving instead of four...I agree it made barely one serving for my taste. Thanks Frank...I made mucho brownie points with the little lady on this one!",
