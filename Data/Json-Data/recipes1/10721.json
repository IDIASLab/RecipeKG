I did add some oregano and extra basil. The beauty of this is that you can add anything to it and it's great- I added green pepper mushrooms (drained) and some italian sausage- perfect for the chunky sauce lover. It was awesome!! Thanks so much for this recipe!!",

Personally, I sautee some chopped onion in olive oil, then add the herbs (regular Italian seasoning), garlic, pepper, a little chicken broth, and the tomatoes. Husband doesn't like chunks of tomato so I usually put the tom's in a bowl and whizz them up a bit with a hand-held blender. If I'm in the mood for a thicker, more robust sauce, I add some tomato paste and more chickie broth.",

I cooked the garlic in the oil and when I poured in the tomatoes I mashed them a little. This is really simple and fresh tasting. Might use fresh basil next time. Great in a pinch.
