But it really makes a lot of it. but that is ok becuase i really experiment alot with it. I grilled with it on the George foreman grill with steak and chicken. the taste was just ok becuase most of the sauce got burnt from the grill. then i tried baking chicken in the oven. OH MY GOD was it good. grilling with this cause is def out but baking is superb. I proably make it again this weekend however i will put it in the crockpot and put some hot sausage links in it. I think it will be really good this way.",
