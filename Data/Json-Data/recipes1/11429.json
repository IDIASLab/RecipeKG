Dried onion instead of fresh?! And no cilantro?!   This needs at least 1 teaspoon of Garam Masala. An additional 3/4 teaspoon of turmeric... 4 gloves of minced garlic, an inch and a half of minced fresh ginger root, a 1/2-3/4 cup cilantro, and a whole fresh onion. I also usually shred some carrot to add to it when cooking the lentils. And I add a diced medium tomato at the end.  I saute 1 diced onion in about 1/4 cup oil until its softened... then add the minced garlic, ginger, and spices and cook for 4-5 minutes, ensuring not to burn the spices and garlic. Then I add the diced tomato and cilantro to the onions and cook til the tomatoes get nice and soft, stir that mixture into the lentils... simmer it all together for about 5-10 minutes and serve it over steamed basmati rice. I've been doing it like this for ages and its incredible. For those that dislike cilantro, just omit it or use much less.",

Cook till onions are a light golden brown.  Add the cumin and garlic in the last 45 seconds before pouring oil mixture into the daal.  Also using ghee (clarified butter) or regular butter gives it a richer and more authentic flavor.  Cook the combined mixture for about 2 minutes on low heat.  Yummy.",

I added a can of diced tomatoes to make a nice sauce and that made it yummy. I'm not certain if that is a 'wrong' choice for this style of food (like puting kethcup on sushi) but the diced tomatoes certainly made my family eat this up. We are vegetarian so I am always happy to find a tasty simple recipe. I sauteed real onion and just used a premixed blend of 'Indian Masala' (Club House brand). A nice healthy meal especially with warm Naan and rice. I would give my version (added diced tomatoes and real onion) five stars.",
