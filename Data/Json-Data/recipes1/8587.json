I mashed the eggplant instead of using the food processor and added potato flakes and Italian flavored breadcrumbs instead of flour for a better rolling consistency. Then I browned them in garlic and olive oil for a real Italian flavor. They are quite tasty and great with spaghetti squash.",

Then I hand rolled them into small meatball size balls and deep fried them. To some of the mix I added some curry cumin and red pepper flakes. I will definitly use this recipe again.
