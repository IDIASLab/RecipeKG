I read all the reviews before I made these cookies and all of the negative reviews are ridiculous. So here's a little advice to those people: Everyone should know that a recipe is not set in stone and never complete. Every recipe needs to be adjusted according to personal taste and most importantly elevation and humidity. When baking it is always necessary to pay attention to the amount of flour you're adding to things - and always add flour/dry indredients slowly as more often than not you will need add more or less than what is indicated on your recipe. To those who said this dough was gooey and hard to work with you will probably need to stick to the pre-made dough in the refridgerated section of your grocery store. Because if you had ever worked with dough that would need to be rolled out you would know that if the dough is gooey before you put it in to be refridgerated it will still be gooey when it comes time to work with it. Use common sense and add more flour. If it is dry and crumbly add a little milk and stop adding flour. Sugar cookie doughs are supposed to be soft but shouldn't stick to your hands. This is one of the best sugar cookie recipes I've come across in a long time!",

                "reviewBody": "I've now tested this recipe twice. It definitely does need more flour for consistency. The taste is overall pleasant not too sweet. As for some of the other comments about sticky dough a little stickiness is not bad. I suggest refigerating for overnight before use. Refrigeration hardens the dough (and removes some of the stickiness). You don't want your dough to be non-sticky before refrigeration. That will mean you have too much flour in the batter. I also suggest that you refrigerate any cut cookies until ready for baking because as the dough gets warm it becomes too pliable. Also the more flour in the batter the softer your cookie will be and the more floury the taste (not the idea - another reason not to over-flour it). I hope this helps someone.",

I made it up 2 days before I was going to use it and put it in a covered bowl in the fridge. The dough is very very soft and hard to work with. I simply used a lot of flour on the cutting board grabbed a hand full of dough and kneaded some extra into each handful. I did not use a rolling pin but flattened it with my hands. Use plenty of spare flour and your cookies will come out fine. Also use a simple outline cutter not one with a lot of detail. The dough WILL stick to each part. A seasoned baker will have no problem with this dough. Sugar cookies from scratch are NOT easy to make. Also you may want to ice these or put on some sprinkles.",

Though I did find it required a little extra TLC and work I have found this to be true of ALL rolled dough cookie batters. But unlike many of the others I had no trouble whatsoever working the dough. I think the long lost secret may be that you need to stir in at least the last half of the flour by hand. An electric mixer overworks the dough so that you need to add lots of extra flour. Once I did this I just added a little extra at a time till the dough was like sticky playdough before refrigeration. Since I live in a tremendously humid climate I find I need to do this with virtually all cookie recipes rolled or otherwise. I ended up with only about 3/4 cup extra flour being required which is pretty normal for me. Great Recipe! I will definitely use it again.",

The only good thing I can say is that the cookies that did get into the oven tasted great. But the dough was a nightmare to deal with. It was gooey and stuck terribly to the counter even though I had HEAVILY floured it. THEN after rolling the gooey dough into balls and rolling in sugar (trying to salvage it) I baked them on an UNgreased cookie sheet per the directions. They STUCK to the sheets! Ugh! I was SO mad at this point! Plus I was idiotic enough to QUADRUPLE the recipe. Sooo I have a LOT of very gooey nearly useless dough. My fault for ignoring the reviews. I'll not use this one again!",
