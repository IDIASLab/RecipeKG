I think that's due in part to the cake flour and in part to the sifting. As the men who tried it said, it's not 'gaggingly sweet' like they feel most chocolate cakes are. I also used the chocolate torte frosting as recommended, and sprinkled chopped pecans on top of the frosting in the middle layer. I will DEFINITELY be making this cake again.",

And I don't even cook or bake often. For those of you who don't know how to do the double boiler fill a large pan up with water to boil and put the mixing bowl containing the eggs and sugar on top of it then stir until it thickens. For the chocolate torte frosting I only used 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup. And it still turned out very good! Yummy! You will also be satisfied with only 1 slice of cake. And it taste delicious with a glass of milk too.",
