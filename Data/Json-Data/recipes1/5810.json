I also added a little cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla to the cake ( covers the box cake taste) I did not have apricots, so I mixed Knotts apricot preserves 1/2 c into the creamcheese mix until smooth(used a hand mixer) then just spread this mixture over the cake batter, ramdomly dropped some extra preserves over it, topped it with the crumble, i added flour to get more crumble, and baked as directed... It was very yummy and I have requests for a raspberry one and a lemon one. Thanks for the recipe!",

I wondered if it would look better with the rounded side of the apricot up so I did a few that way and learned that with the cut side up they catch some of the crumb topping and that's better. If leftovers are kept in a closed container the almonds will get a little soft but it still has a great taste. Definitely mix the powdered sugar with some apricot juice for more flavor and put the glaze in a small plastic bag with a tiny bit of one corner cut off for easier drizzling.",
