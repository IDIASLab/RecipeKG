My other one has 1 TB of honey in it..so I added 1 TB on honey and tasted it. Much better. I will just keep my previous lime dressing though.",

I did cut back on the amount of oil to reduce the fat grams otherwise followed the recipe. Good salad loaded with bright and fresh flavors. Don t skip the almonds as they give you another dimension of flavor. Thanks Barrett for a refreshing salad.",
