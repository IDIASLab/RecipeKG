I put the marinade in a jar and shook it to blend the oil and soy sauce, then poured it over the fish before broiling.  When the salmon was finished I crumbled it over a salad of baby spring greens, green peas, and mandarin oranges. I added more soy sauce and oil to the remaining marinade and used it as a dressing over the salad; it was delicious! I will make this again!",

Of course, I added twice as much garlic, and cooked the fish on the grill.  Served it with grilled asparagus.  Truly delicious, as the name says.  Will definitely be added to my recipe box!",
