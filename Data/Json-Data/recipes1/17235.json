I used what I had on hand (baby Goldfish corn Chex pretzel Goldfish peanuts) - I scrapped the Cheerios b/c last time I baked those in a snack mix they shriveled up to teeny tiny little \"O\"s. I went a bit lighter on the butter and for personal preference added a shake of ground coriander and onion powder. Baking time is dead-on (don't forget to stir!) and upon cooling I scooped in some golden raisins and mini M&Ms'. I am tossing handfuls of \"Nuts & Bolts\" in my mouth as I type this. /crunch. Thanks for an alternative to store-bought bags of Chex Mix!",
