I didn't have much time and I had about 7 leftover cooked chicken thighs, so I skinned them and shredded the meat.  I ended up with WAY more meat than called for.  I dumped the meat in the skillet to heat up and tossed a thawed 16 oz bag of chopped broccoli in on top.  After that was warm, I added the soup (cream of mushroom with garlic) and about 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water.  I'm not EXACTLY sure how much broth, because it was from an open box in the fridge and I just poured until it looked like enough liquid for the amount of food in the pan.  I also tossed about 1 Tbsp of Italian seasoning, because some reviewers said this dish is bland.  Finally I stirred in the rice.  We like a lot of rice, so I added an extra half cup.  I tossed the cheese in on top and let everything cook for 5 or 6 minutes.  Magically, I had a meal and lots of it.  I think this dish, with all the changes, is 4 stars.  Even with the seasoning and soup change, it was a little bland.  My hubby added Sriracha sauce to jazz it up.  Hope this helps!",
