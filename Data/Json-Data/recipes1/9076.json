One small change to the cooking - I drop them in a deep saucepan and bring the sauce to a boil, then turn it down to low and let them simmer for at least an hour.  It gives the flavor time to soak into the meat.\n\nAlso, I recommend using Southern Comfort because it's sweeter than other bourbons.",

If you are having trouble with your sauce being too runny, make sure that you drain the bag of smokies before cooking them.  Also, allow the recipe to simmer to burn off some of the liquid from the bourbon.  I brought the sauce to a boil with the smokies to cook off the alcohol, and then put the burner on medium.  When the sauce was the consistency that I liked, I put the burner on low and covered it with a lid until I was ready to serve the smokies.",
