I didn't add any cheese to it but topped the custard sauce with a little cinnamon. The only that I didn't like is guessing how long you needed to let the custard set to the proper chill. There were also some other things that didn't have a time limit set. I think for a first time cook or beginner it would be a good idea to do this.",
