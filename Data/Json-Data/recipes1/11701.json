Poured onto baking tray and scored into triangles. Baked about 10 minutes at 350 then another 5 at 400. Came out awesome very crisp & dilly with the right amount of salt. Next time I would probably increase the milk slightly and decrease the butter to make it healthier. Maybe add more baking powder too (they came out light but not super-light).",
