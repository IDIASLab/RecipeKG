For those who are having trouble with these biscuits, flour makes a world of difference in a biscuit recipe.  If you live in the South, try White Lily or another low protein flour.  If you live in the North or West, replace 2-3 Tbsp of all purpose flour with cake or Wondra flour for the best results.  Northern flour, especially the nicer brands, have too much protein to make a good biscuit.",

I've been trying to find a good biscuit recipe that didn't call for shortening as did my old favorite recipe because I'm now living in Finland where crisco sadly does not exist. I'm no longer lamenting my misfortunes though as I found this excellent recipe that yields a biscuit that is comparable in flakiness to a shortening biscuit but it's taste is way more flavorful and buttery. I will be using this recipe from now on and am so happy to have found something to bake that sure does remind of being back home. I will note that I didn't use cream of tartar simply because there isn't any available here but the biscuits still turned out tasty and fluffy... I could only imagine that they would be even fluffier with the cream of tartar though. So if you're worried about not having any tartar don't sweat it. The baking powder works just fine.",
