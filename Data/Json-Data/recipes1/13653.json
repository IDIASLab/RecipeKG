I'm disappointed I didn't have this recipe years ago - it is infinately better than the standard corn syrup recipes, and just as easy.  This recipe tastes more like real pie, instead of like candy.  I also recommend using Mrs Smith's deep dish pie crusts instead of the cheaper lard crusts - it bakes better.  Warm the eggs to room temp before making this recipe - will keep the butter from clumping when you add it to the eggs.",

What I was experiencing was written in every negative review I read.\n\nFirst let me say that the taste of this pie is absolutely phenomenal!! A little sweet, yes, but great! My issue is with the unappetizing souffle-type top and that the filling really doesn't fill my dish, leaving a big gap between crust and filling, making my crust crumble down into the pie. Not pretty. But notice the serving calculator underneath the recipe? Problem solved. \n\nEverything else I would follow to a \"T\" except that I would decrease baking temp to 300 degrees and bake 45 mins.Anyone that knows anything about pretty pies knows that if your crust goes, then forget the pie! This temp has burnt my crust each time, even with my crust sleeve on it--SO frustrating. The other change would be to add another 1/2 cup of pecans AFTER the filling is in the shell. That way you'll still have a nice appearance on the top of the pie. \n\nOne thing that some mentioned was that this pie is dry-----this pie----let me repeat----this pie IS NOT DRY! You get somewhat of a crust on top from the souffle-style filling, but underneath that is rich ooey-gooey goodness!!",

F, place halved pecans on top for a more appealing pie. - Bake at 300 for 50 minutes longer or until the pie is puffed and set.
