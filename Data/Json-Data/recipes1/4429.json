                "reviewBody": "This crust was great! Great flavor even though it doesn't have any butter in it.(I'm a true butter lover) And it has a great texture, tender and flaky. The key is to not over work it. When I added the liquids and stirred with a fork to get everything somewhat mixed, I then dumped the dough onto a piece of cling wrap where I used it to lightly squeeze it together until it formed a nice ball. If you knead this dough too much it flatten all the shortening pieces. Therefore you won't have anymore flaky, just tough. The cling wrap trick also helps in not adding extra flour as you do when you knead, and that can also make a tough dough.",

Also, through a successful experiment, I discovered that if one follows this recipe, but reduces the sugar to only one tablespoon (instead of three), the result is an incomparable crust for chicken pot pie.

I have made probably 30 pies in the past 2 months and every one has been consistent. \r\n\r\nI always use 5 tablespoons of ice water and just mix till everything is combined. I try not to overwork. Sometimes the dough appears crumbly in the bowl, but I just push it together, roll it and the results are a perfect, flaky crust every time. Everyone comments on how delicious the crust is!  \r\n\r\nThank you TJ, I will never forget you!",

I used the butter flavor crisco, as it gives crusts a beautiful golden color as well as add flavor.  This baked up so beautifully; was used for a lemon meringue pie.  I prodded the bottom with fork and for the first time ever I've not had a crust shrink away from the sides!....just wonderful and this is what I will use from now on.  I used other reviewers' suggestions of: #1.  toss the wet and dry with 2 forks, as it limits the handling of the dough (works wonders!)  #2.  put dough in a ziplock bag, sealed it, and rolled it out with rolling pin and put in fridge.  I just cut the one side of the ziplock bag and placed in a pan...that's another great tip!  thanks for the best recipe and thanks to the others for great tips!",

Also, I brushed an egg wash over top of the crust before I popped it into the oven.\n\nThe suggestion to wrap foil over the edge of the crust is a good suggestion, but unecessary. I followed the suggestion and wrapped foil over the edge of the pie crust I made, but when I put it into the oven, half of the foil fell off. I am a very lazy person so I decided not to fix the foil. When the pie was done baking, I found that the side of the pie where the foil remained wrapped.. was very pale and not very nice in colour; however, the side where the foil fell off was beautifully goldened! It's up to you~ but the next time I make this crust, I'm not going to wrap the foil around the edge of the crust.\n\nOOH! Almost forgot! Do not be alarmed if the dough doesn't \"form a ball\". When I did it, I used all 5 tablespoons of water, but it still didn't come together to \"form a ball\". After you refrigerate it, it will be \"easy as pie\" (pardon the pun) to roll out.\n\nOH! and I rolled out the dough between 2 pieces of wax paper too.",

Which is intimidating. Get it together, dump it out onto some Cling wrap, and roll into a ball like that. \nKeep it in the fridge for about 15 minutes. The cold helped mine with the moisture problem.\nRoll it out the best that you can. I found mine to work much better just putting the dough into the pan and spreading it out that way.\nIt comes out beautifully, although in my case, it took some work.",
