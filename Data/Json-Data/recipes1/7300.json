I did adjust the water to 1 1/4 cups added 1 1/2 tbl. butter substitute to the water and warmed it in the microwave for 1 min. before adding it to the bread pan. I also used Manischewicz Potato Pancake mix in place of the regular potato flakes. We like the flavor this mix gives to the bread. When making my bread (I always use a bread machine to mix) I add the liquid ingredients including any butter or oil and the salt & sugar to the pan first and stir it around to blend before adding the dry ingredients. I have found this makes for an evenly-flavored loaf that has great flavor and texture.",
