After I had peaks forming I added the secone 1/4 cup sugar and I also added 1/4 teaspoon of LorAnne's flavorings (less because they are very concentrated) and added 2 drops of food coloring. Immediately after adding those items and starting the second round of beating it lost all shape. I beat it for 15 mins expecting it to regain the fluff but it didn't so I added a bit more sugar and kept beating. I probably beat it for 30 mins and it never got fluffy...just runny!
