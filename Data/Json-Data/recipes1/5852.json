I didn't have any spicy chili beans on hand only mild ones so I used them and it really does need the \"kick\" of the spicy beans. I added some cumin to give it a little extra flavor. I think also next time I might add a half of a can more of the sloppy joe mix so it won't be so thick. This recipe is easy and is definitely a keeper. Thanks!",
