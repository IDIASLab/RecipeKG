We tasted it and it was terrific I couldn't wait to sit down and enjoy. By the time we did it had gotten cold so I microwaved it for about 24 seconds. DON'T DO THAT!!! The brie curdled and the oil from the cheese seperated into a messy puddle. At that point the texture was shot and it was greasy. It needs to be served and eaten right away apparently. I'm sad to say I had to throw it out! But it was a terrific recipe very tasty and easy to make. It just so happened that I ruined it! Eating it cold would have been a far better option!:(",

I substituted six slices of bacon fried until crisp and then crumbled. I put the chutney over the cheese and then sprinkled the bacon over that. I served the baked brie with two kinds of crackers and it got RAVE reviews. Even my husband loved it and he had been very dubious about the recipe when I told him what I was making.
