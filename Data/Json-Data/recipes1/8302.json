The changes I made were rather simple....I added an entire sliced up zucchini an entire sliced up summer squash. Then I doubled the amount of spices and butter. Finally there is no really no need to make individual pouches just get a Reynold's Wrap Hot Bag and put it all in one. The only thing I would do differently next time is to cut the potatoes smaller so I could decrease the cooking time as the squash and zucchini cook quickly. I think next time I am going to throw some whole mushrooms in there as well and maybe some parmesan cheese. I can't wait!",

I think a pinch is for playing it safe but you can easily add more of anything you like to suit your taste. Not sure about the other complaints because mine cooked up just fine in 30 minutes. If you cut them up thicker than the recipe calls for well yeah they are going to take longer. These turned out just fine for us and were super simple.",
