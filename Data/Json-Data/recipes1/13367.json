I read the other reviews were people said they felt there were too many big pineapple chunks, so I threw the can of crushed pineapples into my food processor and blended it in to even smaller pieces.  So the punch still had texture, but you could drink it through a straw.  Also, I used coconut rum instead of regular rum, and I poured in the entire bottle (750 mL).  I froze the punch overnight and it was half frozen and very slushy once I broke it up and then just left it in the fridge all day.  I can't say enough how much everyone loved this drink.  Next time we have a party this size (about 30 people) I will make double!",

Next time I'll substitute the crushed pineapple for additional pineapple juice. Even with putting it through the food processor it was still too chunky for my taste. I also used an entire bottle of coconut rum (750 ml) which ended up being about an extra 1 1/2 c and it wasn't overpowering - in fact you still couldn't taste the alcohol. I'm going to make more to have on hand in the freezer for upcoming BBQ's.",

I adjusted the recipe slightly - 3 quarts vanilla ice cream (2 x 1.5 qt container) 20 oz crushed pineapple (including the juice) 18 oz cream of coconut 80 oz pineapple juice (probably could have used all of the two 46 oz cans in hindsight) and 4 liters 7Up. I mixed everything but the 7Up the night before and froze it in an 8 qt plastic container (mixture filled it about 3/4 full - 6 qts). Put it in the fridge about 4 hours before the dance to let it thaw a bit. Scooped the semi frozen mixture into the punch bowl and gradually added the 7Up while whisking to break up the clumps. Had a nice slushy / icy texture and terrific taste. Made 2 full punch bowls full. P.S. No rum - but it was still wonderful!",
