My family requests this often, and with refrigerator pie crusts this is a real time saving version of the traditional comfort food.",

I also added some fresh parsley (chopped) and some shredded mozzerella cheese, just because I had them on hand and wanted to use them up.  I also put a little salt and pepper in the filling mixture.  It took a little longer to cook due to having a larger amount of the filling.  The results were delicious.  I will definitely be making this pot pie often.  I think next time I will try it with chopped chicken.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe Candy.",
