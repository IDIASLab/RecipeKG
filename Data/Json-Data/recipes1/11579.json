This recipe is good but perhapes mis-named. The recipe results in something more like a cobbler than a crisp. If you want something more like a COBBLER this recipe is GREAT. But if you are looking for a crisp I have the following suggestions.   The first time I made the recipe I followed it exactly. The second time I made it I adjusted it.   When I made it the second time I doubled the amount of peaches, and made only half of the topping. (The recipe makes a lot more topping than is needed.)  I also changed the topping a little bit. 1. I added a cup of oats. 2. I doubled the cinnamon.  3. I used only 1 1/2 cubes of butter instead of 2 cubes.  4. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of white sugar I put in 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar.  5. I also drizzled honey on top of the crumb topping before baking it.    ",

I followed the directions as listed except I put a little sugar and cinnamon on top. I would not recommend that because it came out too sweet - but it was still edible.
