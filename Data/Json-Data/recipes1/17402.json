Since that's not what I was wanting I doubled the lime juice and added 3/4 cup sweet n sour mix. It still burns a bit but it's tolerable now. It could probably stand even more sweet n sour to be more my speed. Everyone has their own preferences though! All around this is a tasty and unexpected beverage!",

When I went shopping for the curacao the guy told me the mixer was better unless I Really wanted a lot of booze in my drink. I said 'Oh No!'LOL! Hubby Jokingly told his friends that he was drinking radiator fluid! I didn't have any fresh limes and I had a partial bottle of Rose's sweet lime juice hahaha. I guess it had been in the cabinet for a While since it was kinda brown still tasted fine so I added a wee bit to the glass and it actually turned this drink a pretty aqua color. Tom I didn't figure this was what you were think when you submitted it so I left the other batch w/o the lime. As you can See Carlos Really enjoyed it! Thanks a Bunch Tom this was a Great start to Summer!",
