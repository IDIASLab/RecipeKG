I have always just made them with salt and pepper on buttered toast slices, no cheese, no mayo, no ketchup. But the additions sound pretty good. If you cook your eggs over easy the yolk does get kind of messy while eating but I just sop it up with my toast.  Also, since this recipe is being compared to fast food I have recently ventured into making them in the microwave. It\u2019s faster and easier and less clean up.  Melt a little margerine in a small glass ramekin type bowl. Swirl the margerine around to coat the bowl. Break your egg into the bowl. Prick the yolk gently 2-3 times with a toothpick. It does not run like you might think. Cover your little bowl with wax paper and mike on high for about 45 seconds.  You can make more eggs in more bowls at the same time by adding a few more seconds. Slide them out onto your toast. Use a potholder, they are hot. They come out round just like those egg McYouknowhats.",

From start to finish, I had my sandwich in about three minutes. This is a keeper, no doubt. Perfect for the mornings I'm in a rush and need something quick before class.

He refused to eat much at regular meal times, but awakened me in the middle of the night ---every night---to fix him something to eat.  Since his dementia was increasing and he was not eating properly otherwise, I would jump out of bed and fix him a fried egg sandwich along with a large glass of cold milk.  He always ate the entire sandwich and occasionally ate two.  That made me more comfortable knowing that he was getting proper nourishment.  So, I always kept the ingredients on hand.  From the time my husband awoke me to the time the sandwich was cooked  was only about 3 minutes.\n\nNow I still keep the ingredients on hand; however,my dear husband had to be placed in a senior living center.  He has no one at the center to cater to his late night snack demands.  However, he is getting help from professionals, and is now eating well during regular meal times.  Unfortunately, his dementia is not reversible.\n\nThis is a great comfort food sandwich to keep in your bag if tricks.  I've never met anyone who didn't like them.",
