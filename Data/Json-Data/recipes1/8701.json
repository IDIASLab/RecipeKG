He gave it a 9 out of 10. :-) The only slight changes I made to the recipe was to use crumbled goat cheese instead of feta. I just prefer goat cheese; it's smoother and less salty. It worked very well with the bacon, which was already very salty (I didn't use the additional salt & pepper in the recipe either.) I also used 2 strips of bacon per chicken breast - one inside the breast and one to wrap around it for a nice extra flavor and pretty presentation. I marinated the flattened chicken in the sauce first for about an hour and then assembled each breast in the pan, using a toothpick to hold it all together. 25 minutes was perfect. After plating the breasts, I sprinkled some more of the goat cheese crumbles for presentation. The chicken came out sooo juicy and tender. I give it a 10 out of 10!",

The chicken does not need to be pounded to stuff it-- use a very sharp knife to cut a pocket into the breast, making the entrance hole at the thickest, short side of the breast.  Swing the knife inside the breast to enlarge the pocket without making the entrance hole larger.  Use one toothpick to close the pocket once you have stuffed it.  Also like others, I crumbled the bacon and mashed it with the goat cheese before stuffing, and I wrapped the breast in a par-cooked (microwave) slice of bacon before cooking the breast.  Pan juices were heavenly over some orzo!",

Just make sure not to overcook it because it can get realllly dry even though there's bacon in it. The second time I made it I wrapped the bacon around the chicken breast and it turned out great! I actually prefer it this way now. The bacon was nicely cooked with a slight crisp not soggy like when you cook in inside the breast.",
