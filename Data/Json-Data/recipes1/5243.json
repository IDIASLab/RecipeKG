I used 1 lb. of large macaroni. I used three cans of soup and almost 2 cups of milk since my husband said it wasn't cream enough after a test run. Since other reviews said that the flavor wasn't strong enough I grated a block of extra sharp cheddar cheese and used about 3/4 of it in the sauce and sprinkled the rest on top. I also used 2 T. of spicy brown mustard instead of regular. You'll need to make extra crumb topping if you make this much. It turned out really well and there were NO leftovers and several requests for the recipe.",

This is very easy and super fast with pretty good results. I added approx. 6 oz. freshly grated sharp white cheddar cheese and left out the bread crumbs and didn't bake it. Just cooked and drained the pasta mixed the sauce (plus the cheddar cheese) poured it over the pasta stirred and left it on low for a few min while finishing up the rest of the meal. Worked out great. I also added lots of black pepper and a little dry mustard right before serving. I would use this again for a very fast easy side when we are craving mac and cheese and I don't have any of the blue box mac and cheese in the house. Thanks for sharing.",
