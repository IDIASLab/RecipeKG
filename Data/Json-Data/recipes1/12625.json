The only thing that I changed based upon previous reviews wass to use a thinner cut of bacon and bake for about 15 minutes at 400. I then turned over the shrimp poured out the fat and cheese that had accumulated on the pan and broiled for the last 7 or 8 minutes. Perfection. Than you so mmuch for posting the recipe.",
