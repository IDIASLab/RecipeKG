When I go to my place at beach and I go to fish market and get my clams and steam and eat and use broth for chowder.  But where I live I can get canned clams and bottled juice but you would need a whole lot of those little bottles to make 3 qts..  So I do not have a clue what the people reviewing this recipe are using for that clam juice..  It is a very good recipe, I have made it at beach when I had fresh clams and broth...please somebody fill me in.  Thanks",
