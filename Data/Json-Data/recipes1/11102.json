TO AVOID LUMPS, do not follow the directions as written.  Blend all dry ingredients in the pot you're going to cook the pudding in.  Then slowly whisk in the milk until it's blended.  THEN turn on the heat and start cooking!  I added cinnamon and nutmeg, which is absolutely delicious, but makes the pudding not as \"pretty\" because it turns it a bit dark.  We don't care...just like the flavor!  I also added 2 cups of cooked brown rice, to turn it into rice pudding.  If you like raisins in your rice pudding, just put 1/2 cup raisins in a 2-cup glass measure, add 1 cup water, and microwave 1 minute to \"plump.\"  Drain and add to the cooked pudding along with the rice.  Raisins are an iron-rich fruit, and also add a lot of flavor!",
