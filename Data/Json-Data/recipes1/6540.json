I agree that they are almost like little scones (not a moist cookie and they don't spread). I found that they cooked in much less time than noted - my oven temp is accurate and 13 minutes was plenty so watch carefully. Love that they're packed full of nuts and I used golden raisins in my version - a little more subtle flavor. Will definitely make again.",

I made the first turn plain because I was afraid they wouldn't be any good and didn't want to waste my pecans and raisins. Hubby said to add the rest as the cookies were fine. So the last few batches we had pecans and raisins in them and used the icing that goes with the cookies. Thought the icing would be too sweet as I didn't even use all the sugar in it but because the cookies aren't sweet the icing went well with them though we used it sparingly.",
