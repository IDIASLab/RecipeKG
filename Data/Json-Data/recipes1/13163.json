Though I don't know how it would have turned out using the syrup, the hot fudge sauce was a happy mistake. Very rich and smooth textured. I thinned the mixture a bit with some chocolate syrup because it was quite stiff after mixing with the peanut butter but it still wasn't easy to spread. I think the earlier reviewer's suggestion of putting the chocolate/peanut butter layer onto the ice cream sandwiches first, then the whipped topping would have made my assembly MUCH easier if I'd thought of it! Everyone loved this and it was so simple to make. The possibilities of other combinations of sauce and \"sprinkly things\" are endless and I am sure I'll make this again!",

My ice cream sandwiches must have been the perfect size, because I used 19, just as the recipe called for. I used (Dove) milk chocolate topping and crunchy peanut butter. As suggested by another reviewer, I put the syrup/peanut butter mixture on the ice cream sandwiches first,(plus I drizzled some caramel topping onto that) and then spread the cool whip, it was easier to spread, and no one would be the wiser, because when sliced, it had nice layers. I probably added about 1/2 of a jar of the caramel (for both layers) and will more than likely add more (all) next time. I used chopped pecans in place of the peanuts and dusted the top with cocoa. I wanted to add toffee pieces in place of the nuts, but my stores didn't have them. I will try that though when I find them again. I passed this out to all the neighbors..thumbs up from everyone!",

That way I didn't have to wait for any cooling before assembling the dessert. My pan had enough room for 24 ice cream sandwiches. DEFINITELY spread the chocolate mixture on before the Cool Whip. I added some caramel on top of the Cool Whip which made for a nice presentation. Since this was being served to a party with kids, I feared they wouldn't eat it with nuts. So, I used 8 crumbled Reese's cups in place of the peanuts. Next time I'll use more Reese's cups because everyone wanted a piece of the dessert with lots of the cups on it. When beginning the second layer, make sure you push down on the ice cream sandwiches to eliminate any air pockets in the dessert and to give yourself more room in the pan. I used a 9x13 cake pan, which is deeper than my 9x13 Pyrex dish, and the dessert filled it to the top. This is a super easy recipe. It's easy enough for beginning cooks and kids to make. The options for different tastes are plentiful. Well done!",

I decided to try it again this summer after reading dozens of ice cream cake recipes - and incorporated some of the other recipes into this basic idea.  The new and improved version is a 4.5.   I made a home made chocolate peanut butter fudge sauce, used lots of chopped up salted dry roasted nuts (sprinkling them generously over the chocolate fudge layer) and made sure to use a deep pan to accommodate the layers adequately.  I also put a thin layer of the chocolate fudge sauce on the bottom of the pan before starting the first layer of ice cream sandwiches.  These changes improved the cake immensely in my opinion.  It feeds a lot of people - a 13x9 pan can definitely feed 15+.  You can definitely make this a week or more ahead of time, just cover very tightly in the freezer.",
