After reading reviews, I was just a bit worried about taste; I really wanted very lemony cookies. I used one cup of butter, because I never use shortening/margarine. I added 2 oz of squeezed lemon juice. I added 1/8 cup of sugar (prb didn't really need) and an extra 1/4 cup flour, altho I could have probably added more flour to make it a bit firmer. I was worried about too floury of a taste. Chilling the dough for about 45mins in the refrigerator firmed it enough that I could roll it in my hands. It does not flatten though, so if you want a a cookie and not a ball, you will have to flatten yourself. I baked at 365 degrees after the first batch was just a little too brown on the edges. For 10 minutes exactly. Total lemon fix! Thank you, thank you, thank you!",

It gave a much-needed flavor boost and made the cookies tolerably moist for the first day. The frosting was good enough to raise these to a 3 star rating. However the texture of the cookies in this recipe is extremely dry and crumbly. After only 2 days they were so dry as to be almost inedible. My advice is to save the lemon cream cheese frosting recipe and apply it on some better lemon cookies. I will not make this recipe again as it was a disappointment.",
