Too rich for my taste so then I made it again and only used 4 hersheys chocolate bar and 7 to 8 marshmellows. I did not have any carmal bars so I just used chocolate bars. If really rich flavors is something that is too much for you then the recipes changes I made are perfect for you. Overall I love this pie.",
