I followed the recipe exactly (only cutting the sugar by half) but found the batter to be so thick i added more water and mayo just so it wasn't so bread dough-like. It didn't flow into the pan at all so I was really worried that it was going to be dense and dry. As it turns out it was more like a bread than cake which was fine since I'm a big fan of sweet breads. I did taste test the sauce before pouring it over the cake and really liked it as well; it tasted just like lemon meringue pie filling. Overall I am enjoying this \"cake\" it has a unique pleasant flavor that I'm hoping my picky eaters will like too.",
