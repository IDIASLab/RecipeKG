I prepared the dough on the dough cycle of my bread machine (needed a little extra flour). At the end of the cylce I added about a cup of raisins and started the machine again to mix until the raisins were distributed. I then let the dough rise for one hour in a ball on a lightly greased 10 inch cast-iron frying pan. I baked the bread on the frying pan for 33 minutes at 375. It made a delicious bolle. Thanks for a keeper!",
