Like others have said, they don't spread- which is a MUST in my book! 10 minutes is perfect. Be sure to mix the sugars, butter, PB, egg, & vanilla first- then add the flour mixed with the soda, salt, & oats. Lastly the ch chips. Amazing cookie- thanks so much for submitting!",

I did grind half the oatmeal down in my blender only because we like the texture of it, mixed with the bigger pieces of oatmeal. The batter was still a little loose, so I did end up adding another 1/2 cup or so more oatmeal. For me, 9 minutes at 350* was the perfect time. This made 54 medium sized cookies. Good flavor, very nice. I'd make these again.",

It has a wonderful balanced flavor!  Before making I read over various reviews to see what comments people had.  I noticed the ones regarding moisture being low on several of them and that the 10min mark for baking was the best.  So I swapted the measurements for the brown sugar and white sugar (brn. has more moisture in it) and baked them for the much recommended time of 10min.  They turned out wonderful. :o) Will be keeping hold of this recipe to do time and again.  Thank you",

I USED ORGANIC PURE PEANUT BUTTER WITHOUT ANY HYDROGENATED OILS BUT REGULAR sKIPPY WORKS TOO. I DIVIDED ONE BATCH AND FORMED THEM DIFFERENTLY. HALF I DID AS DROP COOKIES AND THE OTHER HALF I MADE INTO BALLS AND THEN FLATTENED THEM JUST A BIT BEFORE BAKING. WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! THE DROPPED COOKIES DID NOT HOLD THEIR SHAPE BUT THE ONES THAT I MADE INTO BALLS FIRST (AS DIRECTED) WERE PERFECT. I LEFT THEM IN THE OVEN FOR 11 MINUTES FOR A NICE SLIGHTLY CHEWY COOKIE. LEAVE THEM IN FOR 13 MINUTES AND THEY'RE CRISPY. THANK YOU JOAN FOR SHARING THIS \"OUTRAGEOUS\" RECIPE",

The submitter has it right, that this is a well-balanced combination of oats, peanut butter and chocolate chips.  Gratefully, it's not too heavy on the butter and the cookies stay nice and thick after baking - I chilled the dough until fairly firm, then flattened the cookies just slightly before baking.  The cookies are soft but still chewy - not greasy, not cakey, just perfect.  A good old-fashioned cookie jar cookie. Greasing of the cookie sheets, by the way, was not necessary.",
