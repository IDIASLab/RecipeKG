This is a true recipe, the original crawfish ettoufee recipe is not made using any type of tomato product in it nor does it use any type of roux.It's butter, crawfish fat, crawfish, onions, bellpeppers and seasonings. It's the crawfish fat that really makes the taste. DO NOT add in tomato sauce nor paste!!!  You will not get the true taste using Chineese crawfish, the Louisiana crawfish still has some of the fat left on it which will enhance the taste. Thank you Mr. Rita for sharing with the readers a true Louisiana dish.",

My husband was really concerned because he's the one who usually \"cooks Cajun.\" I searched this site for a recipe that looked most authentic to me and saw this one. We all LOVED it!! I added a little more worcestershire and a little bit of garlic powder, but other than that, I didn't change a thing.\n\nWe served it over rice, with a salad and French Bread on the side. There was not a drop left in the pot and everyone raved over it.  I highly recommend this recipe!",
