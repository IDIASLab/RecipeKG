I really like rice krispie cereal so used 6 cups of corn flakes and 2 1/2 c Rice Krispies....VERY tasty! I did find that it cools and therefore hardens very quickly in the bowl before getting it into the pan....so I just microwaved it for a minute and it softened enough to get into the pan easily. I also found that it is easiest to pat down with clean fingers. Amazingly this is not sticky to your hands thp' ot does act like glue on a spoon. Try it you'll love it!
