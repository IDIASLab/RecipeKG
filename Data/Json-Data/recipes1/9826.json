Since other reviewers were having trouble with their apples sinking I chose to grate mine- this worked perfectly. Also- I did not have any OJ on hand so I subbed lemon juice which worked out just fine as well. We made a homemade caramel sauce to drizzle over the top- everyone enjoyed this and we will make it again. Thanks!",
