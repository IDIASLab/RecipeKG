The filling was smooth and luscious! Here's  the list: 12-13 peaches  (about 4 lbs. I found that 3lbs wasn't enough), 1/2c brown sugar, 1/2c white sugar, 1/4c lemon juice, 1/4c orange juice, 3.5 T cornstarch, 2 tsp vanilla, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 1/2 crust recipe (use only 1 egg and 1/4 c water), and butter instead of shortening. After baking I put it under the broiler for a minute to brown it up a bit. Although the crust/topping was delicious, I might try a more traditional crumb topping next time with flour, oats, butter and brown sugar. I think the ideal combination would be using one recipe of the crust for the bottom, then putting the crumb topping on the top. Both are delicious, it's a matter of what your taste is. Please see my photo.",

I did double the crust recipe-it was a bit much-I could have done just fine with a batch and a half.  I used a 1/2 cup of shortening and the remaining amount was butter.  I used approxiamtely 4lbs of peaches-as far as I'm concerned, you can never use enough fruit in pies.  I used 1/4c lemon juice and 1/4 c orange juice.  I used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch, one teaspoon of vanilla and a sprinkle of ginger.  I also used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar as I used fresh fruit that was sweet enough.  I also made the fancy lattice work on the top as suggested by French Blue-it came out gorgeous.  I topped mine with some whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top.  The crust was flakey and delicious and the filling was to die for.....take a look at my picture...and try this recipe!",

I've never made a cobbler before although I consider myself an excellent cook and baker.  I was skeptical about the orange juice and fully intended to follow the crust recipe and combine it with another peach filling recipe.  I'm so glad I didn't.  This was absolutely great!!!  I kept raving about it.  My husband loved it too.  I will be making this again and again.  I did substitute the shortening for butter.  I don't stock shortening.  And I didn't use two sticks.  It was more like 1 1/2 sticks for the cobbler.  Baking the bottom crust first made this the perfect cobbler.  I'll be using this crust for all future cobblers.  I'm making blueberry next (after I make the peach again).  Thanks for a great cobbler.  I didn't do the lattice top either.  I just cut 1 1/2 inch long strips and placed over the top of the peaches.  I just couldn't see myself doing a lattice top.",

This is really more like a giant peach pie than a traditional cobbler -- and that is more than fine with me since I prefer pie crust to spongy cobbler crust.  The crust here...oh my goodness...to die for!  I made 1-1/2 times the crust recipe, and it was just the right amount to split evenly between bottom and top layers.  I took a cue from another reviewer's (FrenchBlue) photo.  She placed the strips atop the pie in three alternating diagonal layers.  Looks so beautiful that way!  I don't think I would've had enough dough to do that with a single recipe.  I measured the peaches in the scale at the grocery store and bought 3.75 lbs.  Ended up being just the right amount.  It took 9 med-large peaches to reach that weight.  I used the full 1/4 c. lemon juice but reduced the OJ to 1/4 c. as well.  Hubby and I both thought the full amount, while it probably would have been good, might've overpowered the delicious peach flavor we were going for.  I just made up the difference in water.  Also added 2-1/2 TBS cornstarch.  Filling was juicy without being runny.  Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe...we loved it! :-)",

Also I would add one tablespoon of corn starch to make it thicker and maybe a teaspoon of Mexican vanilla. It is wonderful and can even be \"better\" with a little tweaking. You need to make sure you roll the dough really thin as there is barely enough dough for the bottom of the pan as well as the lattice work. Enjoy!!",

Instead of doing a lattice top I used a small cookie cutter (about 1 1/2 inch) and placed the cut crust all over on the top randomly. After reading other reviews that said to reduce the amount of sugar added to the peaches let me say that it's not too sweet if you put whipped cream on top. If you eat it as is coming out of the oven and you don't like things very sweet you may want to cut down on the amount of sugar but for me and my family it's perfect just as is.",
