Then I used 1 cup of milk, mixed it into the mixture until soft dough formed. Then I put it down on a floured surface, knead 10 times. Then rolled out to 1/2 inch thick, and cut with a biscuit cutter. I baked in 450 degree oven for 8-10 minutes. Then I made the Honey butter recipe from this site to put on them. YUMMMMM. My family gobbled them up! Thanks for the awesome recipe!Will make this over and over!",

I have used it three times over the weekend for biscuits and pancakes and find it to be a light fluffy biscuit, far superior to its commercial mix inspiration (which is w-a-y too salty!).  I took a reviewer's suggestion and put it in the 3 lb shortening container which works well.  The 10c amount is too big for the container but the excess was quickly used up!  To clear up some confusion, I did not know what to do with the mix to make the biscuits so I found the bisquick site and here is what works well:\r\nBISCUITS\r\n2 1/4 c mix\r\n2/3 c milk\r\nBake at 450 degrees and 12 mins (in my oven).\r\nPANCAKES\r\n2 c mix\r\n1 c milk\r\n2 egs\r\n\r\nFor more recipes, go to the www.bisquick.com website.  The biscuits fluffed up about double in size and were absolutely delicious.  Enjoy, and thanks Janet!",

We have been buying Bisquick and spending approximately $5 on a large box.  We even did the math and came up with us having spent approximately $3.05 to make this recipe which is about equivalent to a large box of Bisquick.  Overall, the homemade baking mix actually did a BETTER job on pancakes (which is a big weekend breakfast treat for our kids) and did good on biscuits.  Also did EXCELLENT on the Cheddar Bay Biscuits in Allrecipes.  Only thing to keep in mind regarding biscuits is to not try to do half of the recipe for less biscuits.  You need the whole recipe so your biscuits will be of a good size and thickness. Something else to keep in mind on this recipe: if you are fortunate enough to have a KitchenAid mixer we really recommend using it to prepare this mix.  Use the wire wisk attachment and it is so easy to do. Only thing is unless you have a really large mixer bowl, would suggest preparing mix in half quantities so as not to get flour everywhere.  ENJOY!  Janet, we truly appreciate you sharing this recipe with us.  What a find!",
