I'm bringing these to my family's Thanksgiving festivities because they are an incredible hit with my neighbors (who I share in the bounty of my backyard persimmon tree) and with my co-workers. I followed the recipe to the \"T\" and my goodness it is by far the best persimmon cookie I've had since my Tia Maria made them for me as a kid growing up in Chile. Thanks again. PS: for those who don't like these too spicy take the spices down to 1/4 TS and the complaint about the \"black specks\" are due to the ground cloves. If you don't like the appearance of them don't put that spice in but the cookie will suffer their fantastic flavoring.",

He's already brought home more persimmons to make some more and I only made last night. Thank you for a good recipe that I think is also healthy.",

I knocked the 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to 1/4 tsp as I find it an overpowering spice. 15 minutes left my first batch almost burnt! I had better results at 12-14 minutes.",
