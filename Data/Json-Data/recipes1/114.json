I was skeptical so I used 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar to be safe. I was out of butter so I used margarine instead. I also added two tablespoons of Dutch Cocoa and a splash of cold coffee for an extra kick. I was leary about the temp so I used 350 degrees and baked for 30 mins using a 9 by 11 in. pan. I discovered this is the identical recipe as Baker's and Hershey's (on the unsweetened chocolate box) with the exception of the brown sugar. For the first time in my life I had perfect brownies! I will never use a mix again. These took some time but they were worth it absolutely perfect! Gooey inside and crispy outside just the way a perfect brownie should be. One day I will try the recipe in it's orginal form. I can't wait for my kids to try these. I am topping them with homemade chocolate frosting and m&m's at their request!",

First I didn't have choc squares so I had to use the cocoa powder/butter ratio on the back of the Hershey's box (I picked this recipe because several reviewers mentioned success with this). Second I couldn't help myself I added a dash of clove. Third I used roasted walnuts and a small handful of semisweet chocolate chips. Fourth I cooked it for 60 mins at 250 then turned the temp up to 300 for another 20 mins and they were perfect. I think it is important to have a glass pan. Glass and metal cook very differently!",
