I made the following minor changes: 1. don't peel the potatoes. 2. don't cook the potatoes that long just til barely tender unless you want mush. 3. use less red pepper (see other reviews. 4. used the potato water with a buillion cube added for broth (use more liquid than called for unless you want it really thick). Yum! Great healthy and easy recipe. By the way one other suggestion is make sure you use SILKEN tofu I think the problem that other reviewers had with consistency was due to using the wrong kind of tofu. Enjoy!",

I used Del Monte canned corn since it doesn't contain any added sugar like a lot of the other brands. If you are concerned about getting the right consistency scoop out the vegetables first and blend them with the tofu then blend and add the broth until you get the right consistency. I used a teaspoon of pepper flakes and it was still a little spicy. Thanks a lot for the recipe and the helpful reviews too!",

                "reviewBody": "YUM. I just finished my first bowl. From the other reviews and my own experience here is what I would change. 1) 1 TBS is way too much red pepper flakes. Use 1/4-1 tsp depending on how spicy you like your food. 2) Reserve at least 4 cups of veggy and broth mix to make sure the soup has texture unless you like soup with no chunks. 3) Saute the onions and pepper in butter or olive oil first with the red pepper flakes while the potatos are boiling then add them to the potatos as the recipe says. 4) Make sure you buy silken tofu. Firm tofu does not work well in soups. 5) This does need something else- thyme or rosemary or another spice of your choosing sauteed with the onion would give it a fuller flavor. 6) I would add more corn- I didn't quite think the 2 cans were enough. 7) More veggie broth (at least 3 cups) Delicious healthy soup!",

I didn't peel the potatoes which makes it a lot easier and makes the color more interesting. If you're not a vegan try grating cheddar cheese on top.",

I just took this to my office holiday potluck and the raving didn't stop. I wished I could have claimed the recipe. I'm 100% there with the common comment that 1 Teaspoon of red pepper flakes is Plenty. Also I reserved more of the chunky vegetables & less broth to help preserve the creamiest of consistencies. I used red yellow & green bell peppers for color. I'm taking it to Christmas dinner this year too! Thanks for the great chowdah!",
