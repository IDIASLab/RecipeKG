I did not use the nutmeg and I used only half as much pineapple after reading previous reivews.  It was awesome!\n\nWill definitely make this a tradition in our home!",

Then put them in a casserole dish with the other ingredients and heated them in the oven. Also I used chunk pineapple rather than crushed. This was soooo good! Update: Made this for the second time tonight but used crushed pineapple - - I like it much better with the pineapple chunks; you can't really taste the pineapple when it's crushed. The pineapple flavor comes through much more with the chunks and I think the chunks LOOK more appetizing.",
