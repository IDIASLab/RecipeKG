Several of the reviews said to \"grate\" the potatoes and not shred them but they didn't mention how to grate them.  Use the smallest side of your box grater.  The potatoes should be like a mush.  Then grate the onions the same way using regular onions not green.  Putting the grated potatoes in a sieve was a new one for me but sounds like good advice if you will also press down on the potatoes after they have dripped off on their own.  My mother fried them in bacon grease so I guess she got more flavor in them that way.  She cooked them in an iron skillet.  I have never made them successfully like she did because I think I'm afraid to get the pan hot enough.  The four pictures of this recipe all showed shredded potatoes.  If I ever make them successfully, I will send you a picture.",
