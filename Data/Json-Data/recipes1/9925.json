This was the perfect recipe! Changes I made: I used 3 bananas instead of 2, allspice instead of pumpkin pie spice and only 1 tsp of that, and I added a tsp. of vanilla. Also, only used 1/4 c. of oil. Baked in mini-muffin pans for about 20 min. Thanks for the great recipe/idea! I would have never put banana and pumpkin together but it works wonderfully in this bread! Also, used 1/2 cup light brown sugar in lieu of the honey.",

Other reviewers who complain about the outside being black and the inside being doughy are adjusting the wrong way.  Turn that oven down!  I made this bread according to the recipe, omitting the raisins, and adjusted the oven temp and cook time as I have stated.  I'm enjoying a perfectly baked slice now!  I prefer quick bread recipes that contain sour cream or buttermilk, but this is a very nice loaf.  I have never seen honey used in a quick bread before.  Four stars from me!",

Because of the nice flavor I think the bread has potential. I will try the recipe again but with a higher cooking temperature. I'll let you all know how it turns out. Addendum: I baked the bread at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and lowered the temperature to 350 degrees for the remaining 30 minutes. The bread did cook but was a bit dark on the outside. It tasted pretty good on the inside though. I think the trick here is to only fill the pan about 1/3 full. It might bake up nicely at the 350 degree temperature in the original recipie if the amount to be baked is not too dense.",

Mixed together they kind of cancelled each other out and I couldn't taste a lot of either. I would use either all bananas or all pumpkin in this recipe. I made it lighter by replacing the oil with the same amount of applesauce and using half real sugar and half Splenda sugar substitute. Also I baked the bread for 60 mins and it wasn't done. I recommend at least 70 mins because mine fell and was heavier because it wasn't all the way done.",
