I must admit that I made the process easier by bypassing the \"cake from scratch\" part and substituted a Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix instead... much easier and I'm sure just as yummy. I did have trouble trying to figure out what \"light cream\" was. Didn't have anything like that in my grocery store... I ended up buying something called \"table cream\" which turns out to be light cream with some sodium. I ommited the pinch of salt for the filling since cream already had. Otherwise the icing was superb and it was easy to put together!",

I cheated and made a yellow cake mix in a sheet cake pan, turned it out, and (once it cooled) cut it in half with a piece of string down the center.  I then put the bottom half back in (carefully!) and made this cream recipe, I had to quadruple it to get enough, but it was very good.  I then put the top half of the cake on, and made a triple  batch of this glaze and poured it on top.  I had to add a little extra powdered sugar though to cut the tart semisweet taste.  After the glaze hardened in the fridge I took some of the custard/filling I had saved, put it in a baggie, kneaded it with my hands, snipped off a corner and then drizzled it over the top of the cake to make it prettier.  The end result, it was delicious and beautiful!  Tasted just like from a restaurant only it served way more people.  A coworker loved the custard filling so much, she ate four pieces (ha ha!)  Thank you for the recipe!",

The filling went wrong somewhere around the \"whisk in the 2 eggs\" part that apparently wasn't enough to completely mix all the ingredients although it looked uniform; if I was to do it over again I'd beat the eggs with the salt until completely homogenized before adding to the other ingredients. I had to bail out to boxed pudding. The ganache (icing) went wrong at the add 1/4 cup conf. sugar and beat vigorously part; this resulted in a somewhat lumpy and grainy texture that no amount of beating would fix. If I was to do it over I'd maybe sift it in a little at a time or I'm told that corn syrup is good for this kind of icing. The flavor was great though dark and rich but sweet enough. All in all people enjoyed it and I'll probably try it again watch out for those tricky spots though.",
