With a few changes to the original recipe--2 cups of flour 2 eggs and only 1/3 cup of Tang--it's a real winner! I can only imagine however how terrible they would be without these changes. I made 6 dozen of these for a company cookie exchange and everyone loved them so they appeal to a lot of people. They are a welcomed changed from the typical cookie.",
