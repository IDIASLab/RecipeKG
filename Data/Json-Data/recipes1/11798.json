I don't have a way of crushing ice though other than going at it with a meat mallet so I decided to pass and just use ice cubes. I'm not feeling that energetic or destructive today. I'm not sure if it's the oj or what but something tastes almost (but not quite!) bitter in this. So I like it but maybe a bit less oj and a bit more pineapple... not sure. Thanks for the recipe!",
