I've made this recipe about a hundred times and every time it is the hit of the party. It's addictive, and you can't mess it up! I so enjoy answering the question, \"How did you make this?\" because no one can ever believe how easy it is. Here are two tips: First, instead of white chocolate chips, I use two packages of vanilla candy coating. It's a little sweeter and has this pleasing melt-in-your-mouth quality. And second, after you crush the oreos, put them in a colander to sift off the powdery part of the cookie crumbs. The powder will darken the white chocolate and it won't be as pretty. I wish I could give this recipe 50 stars!",

The last batch I did was with mini oreos and let me tell you this, if you don't want to make a huge batch that this recipe calls for...simple trick is 1 package of almond bark and 1 8oz package of Oreo Minis...and follow the recipe. Only note is, you don't have to break up the minis. They are already in bite size pieces. This is a fun recipe. Hands down.",
