                "reviewBody": "The only change I intended to make was to replace the collard greens with baby spinach due to personal preference. Other than that, I started this recipe as written. There was a lot going on in this stew yet it was extremely bland. I ended up adding a pinch more of all the spices which helped but there was still something missing. Salt helped but it still lacked depth so I added chicken broth which thinned it down but did the trick. I recommend replacing the water with chicken or vegetable broth from the get go and doubling the spices. The pine nuts didn't go with this either in my opinion. Maybe as a garnish but I'd leave them out altogether if I were to make this again. This one has potential but needs some tweaks.",
