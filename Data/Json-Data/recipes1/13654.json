I left out the onion and red peppers and added some fresh basil oregano & parsley along with some brocoli florets - and it was great. I did decrease the olive oil by nearly 1/4 cup on the advice of others and I'm glad I did. Also I would wait to put the cheese in until an hour or so before serving so it doesn't get slimy. Very easy to make and definitely will make again.",
