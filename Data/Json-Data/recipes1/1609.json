Just thought I would state a few things: If you use a large box of pudding double everything else in the recipe. You can also use chips (choc. PB butterscotch etc.) coconut or other things instead of walnuts as needed. Please post what results you have had with various pudding flavors. For example in my experience lemon has had the best results.",

The didn't spread hardly at all, and were very soft. We'll see how they are tomorrow, but tonight they were excellent! I almost forgot - even though I doubled the recipe, and added extra stuff, I only came out with 30, small-medium cookies. ",
