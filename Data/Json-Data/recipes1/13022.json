To complete the evaporation process i use a splatter screen for the lid as to let the steam escape.Imersion blender to make smooth. No burning in the crockpot and when done thick enough to hold up a butter knife!!",

You need to cook it for at least six hours to achieve a spreadable consistency. Not 1 1/2 hours like the recipe states. Just use your own judgement. Also the best apples to use would be Jonathans Macintosh Honeycrisps and my new favorite Jonagold. This is the first year that I have used Jonagold for baking and everyone raves about everything that I have made using them.",
