It did work and I didn't have to lightly flour or use a rolling pin both of which I'm not fond of. Thanks for sharing this recipe",

My husband request these as he spent time out in Pella, Iowa freqently before we were married and discovered them in the Jaarsma Bakery on the square.  I, however, had never heard of them so I found this recipe.  He LOVED this recipe and said it was almost identical to the cookies he found in Pella.  I found them easy to make; however, the only suggestion I would make is to make sure the almond paste/sugar/egg mixture is mixed very well and all the lumps are gone.  Otherwise, you have trouble piping the mixture out onto the dough - very annoying.",
