It took about eighteen minutes for my apples to cook down. I used a Norpro mini Apple mold to cut the shapes and help fill and seal them. So, I went with round pies. I got four and then pressed out the dough scraps and I got two more. I still used the 3 Tblsp. of filling in each. They were filled plenty. I was left with a good 1/2 cup, or a little more, of filling. It was no problem, because it is fine on its own like a thick apple sauce. I baked the pies on a parchment lined sheet, sprayed with Pam. They took twenty minutes to bake. I just wish pie crust, was a little more healthy because I want to keep eating more. ty",

My only recommendation is to really make sure you cool down that filling.  If you put it onto the pie crust warm, you'll have a lot of difficulty putting it onto a cookie sheet.  Roll out the crust, position it where you want it on the cookie sheet, THEN fill it.  Otherwise, you could end up with a mess.  I rolled it out on parchment paper and transferred the turnovers that way.  This is really worth trying!",
