I've been making nut rolls with my Slovak grandpa for about 5 years now (it's become tradition), and I decided to try this recipe instead of the one we've always used.  This recipe was so much better and easier than the one we were using.  The recipe we previously used required two different rising steps and took about 3 hours longer than this recipe.  The rolls also tasted so much better.  We used the nut filling recipe (with a few tablespoons of milk added), and it was delicious.  We also filled some with fruit instead of nut (we use Solo fruit filling because it is a good consistency for these rolls).",

But I am so completely disappointed with this recipe... and mostly because of the reviews!  Only one negative one out of all I looked at and it referred to pecans which isn't even in this recipe! But I followed this recipe to the T. I used it because of the reviewers claiming the likeness to Kolachi.  This is NOTHING like the kolachi I grew up with.  Yes, the dough had a great flavor, maybe a little sweet for Kolachi, and it was easy to work with.  But the recipe did not tell you the thickness to roll out the dough or what area to roll it out (ie - 12x10).  So because other reviewers claimed the \"perfect\" kolachi recipe I rolled it as I would when making kolachi. It did not rise at all.  The dough turned out tough on the outside and too doughy on the inside.  And they also stuck to the pan. Like I said, I followed this recipe to the T.  The recipe does not say to grease the pans so I didn't and usually wouldn't for this type of recipe.  I feel this recipe just leaves out too much info or I'm very wrong in thinking that nut roll is just another word for kolachi.  So I just thought I'd leave this review for those who might assume as I did.  I believe the dough would make for a great Kolacky cookie however.  And I just might give that a try because the dough is good, sweet and easy to work with.  I also felt that the nut filling is delicious as well. Sorry f",

I do make a few modifications. 1oz of yeast leaves the rolls tasting too yeasty to me so I use 2 tbsp. I weigh the dough and divide it into 6 11-12oz pieces. I roll the dough into a 9x12\" rectangle and fill with 1 1/2 cups filling. I add raisins as my family has always s done that. I also prick the tops and sides of rolls with a fork before baking which seems to help with cracking but sometimes they still crack a little. By all means don't be afraid to give them to people even if they are a little cracked. They are delicious and people slice them when serving anyway. I rotate pans half way through baking and don't bake more than two pans at a time. This is the best nut roll recipe I have found",
