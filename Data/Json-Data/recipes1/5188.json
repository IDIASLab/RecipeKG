Add it SLOWLY -- don't dump the whole amount of cheese in at one time.  Add it a half cup at a time, and keep stirring, and wait 3 or so minutes, and....\r\n\r\n3.  Put the heat on medium, not medium low, and....\r\n\r\n4.  Stir constantly, and...\r\n\r\n5.  Recognize it can be a BASE.  For those of you who like more flavor, add garlic or onions or oregano or hot sauce or whatever you want.\r\n\r\nIt's fine as it is, when made properly.  If you want more flavors, or want it thicker, or want it thinner, correct as you go.",

The trick is to heat the cream slowly until it is almost simmering, then whisk the butter into the cream in small pieces until melted.  Then whisk the cheese in until melted and use freshly grated cheese if available.  The sauce comes out creamy, thick and delightful.  A great recipe....",

Next time I will add 3 cloves garlic and salt and much more pepper and basil. I think adding nutmeg would make it more authentic tasting but I personally do not like the taste of nutmeg. The consistency was very creamy and good - and I only had about 7 oz of heavy cream on hand so used 1/2 & 1/2 to bring it up to one pint. Tossed in diced leftover chicken and spinach for a one dish meal that everyone loved. Thank you for sharing this easy and delicious recipe!",
