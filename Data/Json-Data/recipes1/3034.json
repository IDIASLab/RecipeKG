Try this instead: cream together 8 oz. cream cheese, 4 Tbs cream and 2 cups sugar--light, sweet and simple.",

Tried 'em twice too thinking I may have done something absent-minded the first time. Not. They turned out the same way the second time as well. Like little hats with a brim or maybe little flying saucers. I won't make these again for that reason alone. I didn't use the frosting in this recipe preferring to use my own which was a perfect match for these cupcakes: 4 oz. cream cheese 1/4 c. butter 2 c. powdered sugar some grated lemon zest and enough fresh lemon juice to get to desired consistency. I rated these four stars because Hubs loved them but in my book I'd rate them only three.",
