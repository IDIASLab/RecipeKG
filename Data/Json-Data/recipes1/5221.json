I do have some additions,like others, adding 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp onion powder. I also mix it all together with the flour in a plastic ziploc bag then pour it into a glass pie pan to dredge. If you want Popeyes style chicken, add 1/2 to 1 tsp of cayenne pepper to your flour mixture. I also always use a hint given to me by a wonderful elderly black southern lady; 20 minutes before cooking your chicken, place in a bath of ice water and pour a liberal amount of salt in and let it sit.  This helps with those icky blood vessels than can appear in or near the bone. Finally, I never ever \"quick cook\" chicken.  I have fried chicken for years, giving it up for health reasons, but have found 45 minutes of cooking time are needed especially for dark meat pieces and I repeatedly turn my chicken every 10 minutes or so to evenly cook, cooking the last 10 minutes at around 325 degrees (I use an electric skillet) to keep from burning the crust.",

The smells alone drew my teenage brothers away from the video games! (A magical feat as far as I'm concerned.) I too was always intimdated by frying chicken. My oil was always too hot and my batter never stuck. I always rinsed the chicken in water then just rolled it in flour. This time I took another reviewer's suggestion and did an egg wash. Amazing! Overall everything was to die for and I will DEFINATELY be using this recipe again! I used boneless skinless breast instead of boned chicken and took the advice of another reviewer and added 1 tsp. of garlic powder and 1 tsp. of onion powder. Thumbs WAY up on this one! Thanks to the poster and helpful reviewers!",

I did take the advice of another reviewer and soaked the chicken in salted/ice water for 20 min so there would be no veins.

It turns out burnt and you can't taste the coating. I really wanted to make a good fried chicken so I came to Allrecipes once again. This recipe seemed almost too simple and plain. I did add garlic and onion powder like the others. I didn't even use an egg wash just double-coated the chicken pieces. I probably cooked the pieces 40 minutes or so. The coating was crispy and you could actually taste it!!! My family loved it too. I am just thrilled that I made GOOD fried chicken!!! thank you!",
