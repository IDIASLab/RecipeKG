I too was looking for a recipe for dinner that would have the things I had in the house already (its getting cold in the Midwest and I was not in a mood to shop) and this fit the bill perfectly. The only change I made was not to ad the green chilies - only because my salsa and Nacho cheese dip were spicy enough (and I didn't have them in the house.) Will definitely make again......... Thanks Pat for the recipe!",

I was starving but didn't feel up to cooking a big meal so this really hit the spot. I did use a can of Rotel (very well drained) instead of the salsa and green chiles. I only used a couple large dollops of nacho cheese because I find that stuff SO salty and mac & cheese is salty enough already. I think next time I would skip the nacho cheese completely and it would be good. This is a good recipe when you're hungry but not for anything that takes more than 20 minutes! Thanks:)",
