I'm such a picky cookie maker and this recipe makes the most wonderful shortbread cookie I've ever tasted.  I made some for my Dad, who is a huge fan of those store bought shortbread cookies, and he called me up after I dropped them off and said it was THEE best cookie he's ever tasted.  Better yet, they are so simple to make and you probably have all the ingredients on hand.  Thanks for sharing this recipe that will be sure to be part of my cookie trays for years to come!!",

I divided the dough into 3 parts and shaped into logs then used 3 different coatings 1 was colored sugar 1 was finely chopped pecans and 1 was cinnamon sugar. All were very tasty but out of the 3 I really liked the ones with pecans the best. I also melted some chocolate to drizzle over after they had cooled using chocolate chips with a little peanutbutter for the pecans and cinnamon ones and white chocolate chips with a little butter for the colored sugar ones. Made for a very nice presentation and these seemed to be a hit by all! Thank you for this recipe I will be making them again and actually thinking of making some up to send my my niece for Valentines Day that will be fun to decorate and they are a cookie that holds up well with time.",

I substituted 1 cup hi-maize flour for one of the all-purpose cups made one batch with 1/2 tsp lemon oil 1 tsp vanilla and another with almond extract instead of vanilla and rolled all in colored sugars or finely chopped pecans. All turned out perfectly. I rolled one vanilla-flavored log in cocoa and it was a little bitter so will work on this option maybe adding sugar to the cocoa powder.",
