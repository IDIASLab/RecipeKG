It is a sticky dough when you remove it from the fridge.  To remedy this, only roll half the dough at a time, and use a medium-heavily floured surface to roll it out, keep your rolling pin floured well also.  If it doesn't work out well on the first roll, knead the extra flour in that stuck to it, then try again, it will be easy to work with then.I made small turnovers, about 4\" across when unfolded.  They baked nicely at 350\u00ba for 23-25 minutes.",
