When I was rummaging through my freezer looking for a bag of walnuts that was hiding in there I found a bag of Heath toffee chips so I threw in about a half a cup of those too. Added a tsp of vanilla too. My kitchen timer can be playful and sometime during the timing process it started counting backwards. That sly little dickens has done this before. I didn't notice it until I smelled the pie getting what I thought was a little too done. I whisked it out of the oven immediately. It was still very good but I would have liked it a little more gooey. My husband kept asking \"When can I eat this pie?\" so I let him go at it while it was still hot. We both liked it very much. It was not the recipe's fault that the pie was a tad overdone. Will definitely make this again and keep an eye on my capricious timer.",

Hubby and I use to get toll house pie at a restaurant we would go to frequently when we were dating & first married. I wanted something less gooey. The taste was there... but the texture was off from all that butter. Also the pie we're use to had a graham cracker crust. So the next time I made it I cut the butter down to 1/2 cup and didn't melt it. I softened it (It was very soft..some of it melted). I made Graham Cracker Crust from this site first and pressed that in my pie plate and let it sit in the fridge for 30 min before I filled it. Baked for about 55 min (last 10 cover w/ foil) and it was perfect! Still nice & moist. With these modifications it's a 5 star recipe..but as is 4 stars.",

First I only use 1/2 cup butter, I also add a pinch of salt, a teeny bit of vanilla and I also add a small pinch of instant coffee.  With the few additions it really brings out the flavor of the chocolate.  We've also discovered we like it with a 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of semi-sweet chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips.  Absolutely fantastic with some vanilla ice cream.",
