I've got the leftover cake in the refrigerator and if you put a slice in the microwave for 20 seconds and top with ice cream it's delicious.

I didn't have bakers chocolate SO instead I used hersheys natural cocoa powder mixed with the amount of water recipe indicates and a tablespoon extra of butter. This cake is not super chocolaty as I thought it is sutble. perfect with some white whipped frosting and sliced strawberrys. It was a major hit I am definatly making this cake again. btw i chose to use all natural and organic ingredients. although that doesnt change the calorie intake it is gratifying knowing I am not eating hydrogenated dye filled food. Kudos to this recipe..",
