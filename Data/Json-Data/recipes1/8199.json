With the cheese in this recipe, you don't have to do that, and it saves a great deal of time. It also results in a smooth texture that delicious flavor. One pointer though...it is ALOT easier to work with making one batch of fudge, and not a double batch as this recipe is scaled for. If you're trying this for the first time, divide it in half, and then go at it.",

It does makes huge amounts, so halve it unless you're cooking it for a big party.  It works best if you sift your confectioners sugar and cocoa to get rid of lumps.  It's easy to make, but does require lots of stirring.  It gets stiff very quickly, so I wound up kneading it with my hands.  I took it to a party and everyone raved over it.  I do think it's best not to tell people what is in it until they've made their mind up about it.  Some people are very suggestible, and if you tell them it has cheese in it, the cheese will be all that they taste.  Otherwise, you really don't notice the cheese.  I used Velveeta and it worked nicely.",
