I actually picked this recipe because my 8yr old niece wanted to cook something all on her own no adult help. They turned out so good no own believed she did it by herself! Forget storing them she barely had any to take home. They also take flavoring well just a tsp or three (to taste) of any extract does wonders. We like lemon almond and vanilla.",

I added the zest of one lemon, a capful of vanilla, and since I used unsalted butter, I added a pinch of salt. These are great!  They're not overly sweet, but grandma used to put a lemonjuice/confectioner's sugar glaze on them, which would probably make them that extra bit sweeter and tangier. They probably won't travel all that well, but this kind of cookie never does. But the texture is worth it!  Thanks.",

I read a comment that the shortbread was crumbly To avoid this make shortbread a week or two or three before you need it, store in a cool place to mellow this improve the flavour as well. I will be making my shortbread tomorrow and they will be perfect by Christmas. Once Christmas is over I freeze any shortbread that are left, and just take out what I need to thaw. These keep for several months in a tightly closed container. I drop teaspoons onto a cookies sheet I like the irregular shape but if I want to get fancy I add a little more flour use a cookie cutter to make stars or snowmen. I don't frost these they don't need it they are so delicate that it would over power them and they are shortbread not sugar cookies.",

Make sure to really whip that butter before combining. It is very important to chill the shaped cookies before baking if you are using real butter! I have no doubt some reviewers cookies turned out flat if they skipped this crucial step or didn't use the proper ingredients. I did bake only for 16 minutes on the top rack in my oven and they were perfect. I added lemon extract as I was frosting with lemon icing and in the future I will add lemon zest (and that pinch of salt) or other extracts. Good luck with these cookies everyone!",

I baked 2 pans first one I baked right away without chilling second pan I chilled first they both came out exactly the same! Instead of using flour when pressing down with the fork I used granulated sugar gave them a nice glisten.
