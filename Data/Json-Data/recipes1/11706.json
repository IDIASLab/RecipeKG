As the recipe stands I think it needs some corrections: the pepper & onion should either be a little pre-cooked (e.g. sauteed) or the baking time extended as otherwise they are still quite raw tasting & crunchy. I only used half the quantity of crackers & that was more than enough. I would probably not prepare this dish for others if I wanted to show off my cooking skills. It is an interesting flexible & fast recipe for yourself & family however.",
