As is it is bland is it's taste. The appearance and texture are pleasing: a warm brown color and soft center. I split the batter into three sections on my first try to experiment with it since others reviewed it as \"bland.\" I made one batch \"as is \" one batch with cinnamon in place of nutmeg and one batch with fresh plump raisins. All three batches still needed a little something different such as white sugar. But I'll have to find out how that turns out next time. For now I give it three stars because you're certainly on to something here. I look forward to reading future reviews with other variations.",
