I used a ready made graham cracker crust which I brushed with an egg white and put in the oven for a few minutes to crisp and then followed the directions. I made a caramel sauce by melting 1 stick of butter over medium heat adding 1 cup sugar and stirring until a deep golden brown. I added 1 cup whipping cream and whisked until smooth. Delicious!",

It's creamy and very delicately spiced and still has that wonderful pumpkin flavor. In place of the orange juice I used maple syrup. To serve I drizzled hershey's new Dulce de Leche syrup over it and the flavor combo was amazing. Thank you for an excellent recipe Nancy--it is a great year-round dessert & would be perfect for Thanksgiving!",

The recipe calls for waaay too much ice cream- enough to make two pies. I just stored the extra ice cream mixture in a plastic container with a piece of waxed paper beneath the lid to stop ice crystals from forming. This pie makes great leftovers and the only hard part is transferring the pie without it melting. I recommend an ice chest or cold-thermal bag with ice packs. This is a sure-fire pie!",
