Mixture does not have to be mixed smooth: the batter will work out any lumps as it sits.  Stir once or twice a day until it smells right.  It will have a nice sourdough smell to it after about 4 or 5 days, depending on the temperature of your kitchen.  You can add a teaspoon of sugar to quicken the process.  If you want to speed the process even more you can add a package of yeast to the water before adding the flour.  Use as directed in your favorite Sourdough Bread recipe.\n"
