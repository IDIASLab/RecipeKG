I hate instant mixes because we don't know what food additives flavorings flavor enhancers and preservatives they put in there. The reason we bake our own is because we don't want those \"mass produced\" that they sell in a retail store or supermarkets. it's nice to make our own... from mixing to baking. it's safe and healthy. I don't try to influence you guys... anyway this is just my opinion. Anyway your recipe sounds ok.",
