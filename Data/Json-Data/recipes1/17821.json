My husband wasn't too happy about me making it as he likes his steaks BBQ'd, but when we sat down for dinner he ate every bit of his and liked it really well. I have a hard time chewing steak, but this was very tender and was able to cut with a butter knife or even sometimes my fork. Dad isn't a steak eater at all so I cooked a chicken breast for him along with the steaks. On the video the chef said that by now we should be thinking of 17 different ways to change this sauce up and he was right. I decided to use a teriyaki sauce instead of BBQ sauce. It was an easy meal to make. Mom made twice baked potatos and a veggie and cantalope to go along with it. When we were all done there was one piece of steak and half the chicken breast left so I left it with my mom and it soaked in that wonderful sauce all night and day. She said tonight it was even better than last night. Dad said it was the best piece of chicken he's ever had! So I think next time I'm going to marinate the meat in the sauce for a few hours or up to overnight... or possibly sear off the meat and make the sauce in the afternoon and put it in my crockpot on low for a couple hours to soak in that wonderful sauce flavor.\nGreat recipe Chef John!! It's a keeper!",

I doubled the sauce since it was nice to use it for dipping. My son doesn't like steaks since he has a hard time chewing it so I sliced his thin. Amazingly, he ate it all!

The method for cooking the steak worked well. (I had some teriyaki sauce left over in the fridge and I heated it and used it as a dipping sauce for the steak. That was great! Check out Teriyaki Marinade and Sauce by Celeste on this site. I used it for chicken originally and now steak but you can probably use it for shrimp as well.)",
