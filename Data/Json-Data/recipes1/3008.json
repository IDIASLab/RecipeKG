Really easy, and because I made very small loaves ended up with 3 of them.  I'm freezing two of them for when I don't feel like making bread.  Didn't have any issues with the dough being too sticky or not sticky enough.  I did roll in corn meal before baking just to make them a tad more English muffin-y.  Thanks for the recipe!",
