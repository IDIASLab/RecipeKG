It is a standard misconception that 130 is medium rare. Not true. 120 will come up to medium rare,(125), once it sits for 5-7 minutes. Do NOT cut into the meat or poke it with a thermometer to check for doneness as all the juices will leak out. Figure 2-1/2 minutes per side on medium high for med rare. Please do not overcook filet. There is no fat on this cut and no margin for error!",

I kicked the recipe up to my tastes as follows:  Try with a NY Strip intead of the Filet.\nI coated the beef the with lots of coarsly cracked pepper and rubbed it in well.  After I browned it in a scorching hot pan, i deglazed the pan with about 1/4 cup of brandy  I turned the heat to med and added about a tablespoon of finely chopped shallots, then followed that with a little beef stock and let that cook to reduce a little.  After that I added the heavy cream slowly until I had enough suace.  I let that stay on the heat until it thickened a bit  then poured it over the beef. It is a delicious sauce.\nOther cuts of beef work as well if not better than filet.  Try this recipe with a ny strip  before you take the plunge to filet.",

I prepared it exactly as written, except for letting the sauce simmer longer than the 6-8 recommended minutes. It took longer than that to reduce down, about 10 - 15 minutes on medium heat in a large skillet.  Word to the wise - Don't leave the sauce on the heat- even on low. I thought to keep it warm in case he wanted more sauce, and the cream came apart and ruined the sauce.   I'll definitely be making this again. It tastes amazingly close to a meal I had at a very fancy French restaurant. Now I'll be able to make it at home! Thanks for sharing.",

Light cream is fine but I advise against using milk or 1/2 & 1/2. The milk will always curdle. To flame anything remove the pan from the heat pour on a jigger of cognac avert your face and ignite the cognac. Don't be alarmed if it flames up a lot. Alcohol burns at a lower temperature than most things but if you're not careful you could set your kitchen cabinets on fire. Set the meat aside to keep warm while you deglaze the pan with a small glass of red wine and stock. Let it cook down to half its volume then add the cream and stir in a pat of butter for each filet.
