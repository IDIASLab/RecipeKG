The buttermilk pie was runny because they didn't incorporate the ingredients properly. This pie has a lot of liquid, so you have to be careful. Buttermilk pie looks easy, but that's because the ingredients are so simple. It takes technique to combine. Start with room temp. ingredients, and make it easy on yourself and do the first 3 ingredients first and blend well. I melted my butter instead of softening it and it came together much better. When adding the eggs, do one at a time and make sure its incorporated well before adding the next. Then the buttermilk and vanilla. Overall, not a bad recipe for buttermilk pie on this site. It is one of the best out of the 5 others I've made and reviewed on this AR. The baking time should be tweaked, as with all custard pies you can partially blind bake the pie shell, or bake it on the lowest rack for 400 for 10-15 min to set the crust and then lower to the posted temp. until it's set. This easily prevents soggy bottom crust. Buttermilk pie is done when it doesn't jiggle. Don't overbake the pie. It's not supposed to be dark brown on top. Who likes dark brown scrambled eggs? Ew.",

I was trying to find a recipe that was more of a spongy kind of pie, from a recipe that I loved at a Utah restaurant. Anyway, upping the flour turned this cake into a recipe of its own, so maybe I will post it seperate.",

I would follow the recipe strictly, but the pie would always come out too runny, no matter how long I cooked it.  Finally, one of the reviewers on here pointed out that they accidentally misread the ingredients, and the pie came out great.  Then another reviewer wrote that she deliberately altered the recipe in one key way to make it less runny.    What I did was follow the recipe included except for three things: I used 3 tablespoons of flour instead of 3 teaspoons; I used 1.25 cups of sugar instead of 1.5 cups, and I also added maybe 0.75 tablespoons of cornstarch to the buttermilk I had, since it was 1% fat buttermilk, and I wasn't sure whether all buttermilk was supposed to be that low fat (this was also suggested by one reviewer).    I ended up baking the dish for around 60 minutes or so, and the center came out perfectly no runniness at all, even after cutting out one of the pieces.  Good pie, and it takes about 15 minutes to put together, especially when you use a store bought pre made crust like I did.  Try it!",

I did use lowfat buttermilk so I dissolved 1 tsp. of cornstarch in the buttermilk before adding it. I really want to try it with egg beaters and margarine but I'm sure it won't be the same.
