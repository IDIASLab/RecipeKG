I used the one green onion chopped and just sprinkled a handful of cheddar each time and sprinkled the spices did not measure. This was so delicious and I want some more!

I used a 6-inch WW tortilla also sauteed the spinach along with some button mushrooms as I do love how they compliment each other in a dish. I only used a TEENSY bit of cheese and topped with some medium salsa. YUM! Had all the ingredients in the house and it hit the spot. Thanks for the great recipe idea - but for anyone else if you like mushrooms - definitely saute some first and add to the spinach!",

And giggle all you want but I adore the \"Xtreme Wellness High Fiber\" tortillas (anything w/ the word \"Extreme\" or minus the \"E\" makes me shudder) but when they're grilled w/ tasty fillings I can ignore the goofy name of them and revel in the fact that they're super-good for you.",
