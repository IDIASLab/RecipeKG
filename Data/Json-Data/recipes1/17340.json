Not the same but they are ones we like and I knew they would hold up well in the deep fry. After reading the reviews I decided to add some chopped green bell pepper and I do think this recipe needed it. If I were to make again I would also add some Old Bay seasoning to the mix. Overall good recipe and one I would make again when I had leftover crawfish tails.",
