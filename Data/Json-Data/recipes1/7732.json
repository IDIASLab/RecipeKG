I used 2/3 of the mixture for the bottom crust and the remainder for the topping and I was happy with that. No need to measure the apples just use enough to cover. I made half the recipe which was just perfect in a 7x11\" pan but a 9x9\" would have worked well too. I have mixed feelings about these bars--while they are delicious they are not a sturdy bar so are best suited to \"cut as you go\" and eaten with a fork. Given that I made these for my husband's staff this was not a practical choice when what I needed was a \"grab and go\" bar!",

I took the previous posters advice and put 2/3 of the crust in the bottom of the pan and usd the remaining 1/3 on top instead of doing 1/2 and 1/2. That way the bottom crust is sturdier and you can see the apples better which is more appealing to the eye. I only had one cup of caramel sauce so I just adjusted the amount of flour and it seemed to be plenty. I incread the apples to about 3 and 1/2 cups but I would still like more. I felt that the apple flavor got a little lost. I will try 4 and 1/2 Cups next time. Also I used 2 Gala and one red delicious apple because that is what I had on hand next time I will use Granny Smith for a tarter bite. All in all very good recipe. Thanks for sharing!",

I was using very sweet apples, so I reduced the brown sugar to 1 cup, and that turned out to be perfect, so I think no matter what kind of apples I use, I'll always use less sugar (between the caramel and the apples and the sugar, one cup is enough for me). I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the cookie mixture, and it tasted very, very good! I want to make cookies out of it, I liked it so much. I used 2/3 of the cookie mixture for the crust, and baked it 3 minutes longer than written. I used a lot more apple slices than written in order to make a single layer on top of the crust. I made my own caramel sauce from here. I doubled it, and had 1/2 cup leftover. These were phenomenal and almost obscenely buttery (but the oats and the apple make up for it, right?). Delicious. ",

I convinced her that it would be kind of difficult (and MESSY) for her teacher to scoop out caramel and serve 25 kindergarteners with no help. So...I went looking for a recipe that might be a little less messy and still appease her craving. This recipe was easy enough. And we had all ingredients on hand. However something went wrong with the caramel topping/flour mixture. It says to boil for 3-5 minutes. I went with 4 to be safe. It came out so hard that I had to just lump it in piles around the perimeter. I tried to smooth it with a spatula but no luck. I thought maybe after baking it would smooth out or melt down. No luck! It just baked in the oven in clumps. Maybe I boiled it too long. If I try again I think I might skip the flour or atleast use less - it seemed to thicken too much. And boil for 2 - 3 minutes tops.",
