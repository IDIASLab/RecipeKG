When you roll up the dough chill the \"log\" well before slicing or else you will have a soggy dough mess (like my first batch!) especially if you are baking these on a hot summer day like I did. Also instead of sprinkling the pastries with powdered sugar I sprinkled them with the leftover chopped hazelnuts. They turned out pretty yummy although kind of expensive to make if you don't already have these ingredients on hand. I would probably make these again but save them for a special occasion. They would look stunning on a Christmas cookie tray!",

Diced nuts would be tasty as well. Can make icing with milk afterwards for sweeter taste. As is this would be better for those that can not do so much sugar/carbs in the diet.
