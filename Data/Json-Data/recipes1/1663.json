I jumped on here in a panic and found this recipe. I halved it and used an 8x8 baking dish and baked it for 20 minutes at 350. My oven runs hot though so other ovens may need more time. I also added a 1/2 t of vanilla and a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. If you decide to do the same keep in mind that I was halving the recipe. I threw in 1 t of baking powder since there seems to be some confusion as to whether it's needed or not. It turned out great! It's more of a spice bread than a cake and the leftovers go great with a cup of coffee in the morning.:)",

Unfortunately no one in the family had the recipe so when Grandma passed away - about 15 years ago - the recipe was lost. I tried for years to recreate the taste without success. But now I can! Since we are cutting back on desserts I do find this rather sweet so I will experiment with that. Grandma also added ginger brandy to the recipe (at least she said she that was why she wanted it) and chopped walnuts. Thanks for this recipe!",
