I left out the cheese cubes and added some grape tomaotes I cut in half 1/4 of a large green pepper and just a little minced vadalia onion.

The combination of the cajun spice and Italian dressing works very well. I didn't have Monterey Jack so I cut up mozarella cheese sticks along with cubed summer sausage. I added cut up carrots onion tomato broccoli and marinated artichoke hearts. I made it the night before to let the flavors blend. And also to let the pasta soak up the dressing so the salad wouldn't be too wet. But extra dressing can be added before serving if it's too dry. Will make again!",
