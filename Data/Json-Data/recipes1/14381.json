However, I took a chance and used Heineken for this recipe as well as the taco seasoning and tomatoes with chilies and the soup was DELICIOUS. I couldn't detect a \"beer\" taste in the soup at all and found it to be a bit on the mild side. Everyone in my family loved it. I made another pot for tailgating - it was the most popular dish - everyone wanted seconds and the recipe. It's easy to put together.  You could easily substitute chicken broth, as many people have, and leave off the cheese and sour cream (or use reduced calorie products)and use baked chips to make it more diet friendly.  I put mine in the crock pot before going to bed.  The chicken was frozen when I put it in the pot.  The next morning, it was so well cooked, I didn't have to take it out and shred it.  All I had to do is \"grab\" each breast a couple of times with tongs and the chicken just fell apart.  Then I gave it a good stir and that's all it took to shred it.",

So I only used 4 chicken breast, doubled the recipe, added water no beer or chicken broth ( the chicken makes its own in the water) doubled everything else. You need large crockpot.  Just threw everything in the crockpot.  Took chicken out about 4 or 5  hours later cut it up threw back in.  Also added a little cumin and chilli powder next time I will add a little cilantro.  Served it with nacho chips.  Sour cream and cheese would have been good with it though.  Served a crowd and was under my 20 dollar budget. And even after cutting the chiken back there was still a good amount in it.",

I followed advice from other reviewers & added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp cummin & 4 T taco seasoning.  Used pinto beans instead of chili beans and added a full 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.  I also added about a teaspoon of sugar at the end - I felt the beer gave it a weird bite or bitter taste.  Next time I'll skip the beer and just add chicken broth in it's place.
