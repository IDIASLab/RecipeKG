One thing I have learned is to put all the dressing ingredients in the blender and puree' instead of trying to finely chop the onion and wisk everything together.  MUCH easier!  In the winter time when strawberries are out of season (or just for a change), I use a can or two of mandarin oranges instead of strawberries.  Crumbled feta cheese is also good on this salad if you like feta and crushed walnuts are a good (and cheaper) substitute for the almonds if you don't have almonds on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!",

Small modifications to the original:\n\nCut the sugar down to \u00bc cup.\nAdd a few turns of fresh ground pepper\nUse balsamic vinegar.\nUse red onion.\nAdd some fresh bacon bits\nAdd a mix of blue cheese and feta cheese.\nAlso, do not mix the dressing in with greens, as it will only wilt the salad.  Just apply as normal dressing.  Mixing in the dressing and letting it sit I think would make it too \u2018limpy\u2019.  \n\nWe put a few red onion slices on top with the cheese and bacon.

It is important to chill the dressing for a bit after mixing the ingredients together so that they blend with eachother well and mix well right before pouring it on the salad.  My advice is not to skip the onion even if you don't like them because they play an important role in the taste of the dressing.  You can hardly taste them in the dressing as the onion taste is not the dominant taste but they play an important role in marrying the sugar and vinegar together to create the specific taste this dressing has.  For mine I halved the amount of sugar and it still came out super.  I love the strawberries in the salad, but if you don't have them they can also be substituted for other fruits such as pineapple, oranges, or apples.  A+  :)",
