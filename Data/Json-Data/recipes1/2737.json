(This recipe makes a lot by the way- they weren't around days later for lack of consumption!) They're perfect seasonal cookies for the colder months. I served them at a gathering and everybody said they were wonderful- even my husband who insists that a cookie isn't a cookie unless it has chocolate chips in it.",
