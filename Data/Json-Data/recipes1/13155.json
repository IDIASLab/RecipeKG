You have to watch out for the people who don't drink or aren't uses to drinking because this can pack a wallop. It's decieving because its sweet and smooth going down. The effects aren't felt until you stand up.---Watch grandma by the punch bowl! lol PS we always added a full jar of maraschino cherries to the bowl",

Since our family travels quite a bit for the holidays to different parties and such, I make this for Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and New Years... For a different crowd to each. EVERYONE RAVES about this punch, I have to make recipe cards each year to pass out because after the first year my hand was cramped from writing it down so many times.  Over the years I have tweaked it.. I buy either 7-up Pomegranate or Sierra Mist with Cranberry (for color and taste) and I get pink lemonade (helps with the color as well) (No red food dye is needed this way) Again many thanks to Kerri and her Fantastic recipe!!",

Didn't bother with the food coloring and the cherries I bought sunk to the bottom (used the jarred kind - I guess the recipe intended fresh to be used?) Ended up spearing 2 red and 2 green cherries w/toothpicks and poked one through the center of four orange slices that were floating (the lemon slices flipped over when I tried it - too small.) SO festive looking! Loved the lightness of the carbonated drink - not too sweet. Served its purpose - got us all warm and fuzzy at a \"pre-party\" party! Thanks!",
