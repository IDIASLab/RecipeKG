I used a coffee can to make part of this and I loved how the bread came out---the ridges on the coffee can made perfect slicing marks. I also make a regular loaf in addition to the coffee can loaf.

I rolled out the dough until it was an inch thick, cut out 8 3 inch wide muffins, reworked the leftover dough and put that into a small loaf pan. After they'd raised I put them in the oven for 8 minutes and then flipped them over and dropped the temp down to 375 for another 6 minutes.  Don't turn them over before you cook them for 8 minutes otherwise you'll smoosh out the nooks and crannies.\n\nI don't have a bread machine so I mixed the dry ingredients,  made a well in the middle and then mixed it all together.  It was easy.\n\nThese have the BEST flavor of any English Muffin's I've ever had.  Next time I'll add cinnamon and raisins.",
