The shredding of the potatoes and onion were very time-consuming. I squeezed them dry with paper towels. I must have used fairly large potatoes because I ended up using 3 eggs and a full cup of flour to make it all stick together. Not owning any round pans I made it on a regular cookie sheet with sides. I sauced it half with pesto (ran out) and half with pasta sauce. Toppings included 4 sm/med sliced potatoes two chopped sausages mixed sliced bell peppers and chopped onions covered with mozzerella cheese.",
