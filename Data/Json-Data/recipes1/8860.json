I think next time I'd soak them in a shallow dish rather than a bowl for better soaking. I added more Whiskey per the suggestions. Nice! I forgot to top with powdered sugar oops! That would have helped with presentation. I poked holes in the cake with a toothpick prior to drizzling with the glaze (which I made with half the recommended sugar). That helped with moistness. The cake goes nicely with a bit of whipped cream and tastes great the next day too for breakfast.",
