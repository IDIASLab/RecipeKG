Also they're kind of like a candy/cookie hybrid so smaller is better. (You can have more than one if you like...)",

I thought they had spread a bit too much so added more flour like the other reviewers had said. I should have tasted them first. I was very disappointed that I'd added the flour. Yes the cookies spread but if you don't overbake them they come out nice and chewy leaving me wondering if they are a cookie or a candy--a very good quality for a cookie named \"chewies\". Definitely don't add more flour!!!!! I was so disappointed with the flavor of them--they tasted like a toll-house cookie wannabe. And they were bland--too floury and maybe needed salt. I think the cookies turn out so differently for people because we all have different ovens of varying age and quality. Buy an oven thermometer and see if you are baking at the temperature your thermostat says.",

I just mixed it in until the dough resembled chocolate chip cookie dough.) The second time I also chose to bake them in a cake pan and make bar cookies out of them.
