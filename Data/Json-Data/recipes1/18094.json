I make the sauce as directed, but I use 1&1/2 times the amount of all the other ingredients.  I bake it at 400 degrees for about 25-30 minutes, and that makes it just right for our tastes.  I have since experimented with different dried fruit blends (tropical, etc) with equal success.  It's a healthy snack staple in our house!",

I did not add the raisins or cranberries until after the rest of the mixture had baked because I didn't want them to burn. (Whenever I make trail mix or granola with the cranberries and bake them it never turns out right. They either dry out become rock hard or scorch and taste awful). We ate this as a breakfast cereal (granola) sans chocolate covered peanuts with fresh strawberries sliced over the top. VERY good. I'm glad for the previous reviewer who suggested to double--I agree that the mix would have been way too wet had I not and maybe I would not have had as good of an outcome.",
