I ate with some sliced cucumbers I had and can see how it would be wonderful as a marinade too. It does make a lot if you are using as a dip so I think I might try it with some pasta or as a marinade as well. I dumped it all in the food processor at once and it was fine although still somewhat chunky but I don't mind it that way. Thanks!",
