I chose to reduce the oil to 1/3 cup, & used rice vinegar in place of white wine vinegar because that is what I had on hand.  I would increase the amount of vinegar & lemon juice combined, to equal the amount of oil. I would recommend reducing the amount of thyme by half, especially if marinating overnight/leftovers, unless you really like a strong thyme flavor.  When baking the beets I also recommend standing them on the stem end to bake, because I found it difficult to peel them & see where the peel was,when baked on whatever surface landed on the pan.  This may be due to using larger beets which had to bake longer.  I'm disappointed that I didn't like the finished salad better than I did.",

And besides there's so much more going on with this salad than just beets! We loved the dressing with the 3:1 oil to vinegar ratio we prefer. I also liked that it called for the less harsh white wine vinegar and lemon juice. I did however skip the thyme preferring the clean and simple flavors of the dressing without it. I also loved the presentation and the beautiful less common components of the salad itself. No feta on hand and Hubs doesn't like it anyway; so he enjoyed his with fresh shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano and I happily had the blue cheese he detests on mine. A simply lovely sophisticated salad.",
