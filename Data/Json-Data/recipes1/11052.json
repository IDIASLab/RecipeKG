The only major thing I changed was eliminating the water and beef boullion and using low salt beef broth. After browning my beef and vegies I put everything into my crock pot. For those who mentioned that the meat was tough, the slow cooker seemed to be the answer. I always add more seasonings (garlic and onion powder) and I boiled my egg noodles in a separate sauce pan and then added them to the slow cooker at the very end. Hubby Drew and kid Ash (Ty was at dance) went nuts over this! Thanks Brenda for a very quick and satisfying meal!",

I made this soup for a girlfriend who was recuperating from surgery, and needed something nourshing yet light, and very easy to reheat.  I played a bit with the recipe by seasoning the meat with seasoned salt, pepper celery salt, and onion powder before sauteeing(pat the meat dry first)with the onion and celery.  I also used 1 can of low salt beef broth in place of 2 cups of the water, and I added a can of drained beans(I used large white beans)along wiht the rest of the veggies and noodles.  I found that the salt is more controlled, and if the soup needs more salt or pepper, it can be added at the end of cooking.  This soup is so nourshing and she loved it.  My boyfriend, who was a very picky eater loved it too.  You may need to up the liquids, so buy 2 cans of low salt beef broth just in case.",

I added 1/4 cup of flour into the meat mixture before I added liquid for a thicker consistancy. I also added approx a TBSP of onion powder and used Ground Deer Meat instead of stew meat.
