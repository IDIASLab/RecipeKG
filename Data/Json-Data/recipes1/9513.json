We also add gumdrops that you can usually find cheapest at Wal-Mart(do NOT add BLACK..yucky flavor! Add them at the end so they don't melt we also like to add M&M's- we add them last also. We find it fun to coordinate colors with the seasons. Holiday time with red and green M&M's and red and green gum drops is really fun esp with my 40-50's singles group! It works for all age groups!!!",
