This recipe sets up much more predictably than the one made with sweetened condensed milk and lemon juice. The texture is light and creamy when served cold - tends to get a little loose as it comes closer to room temperature. As a consequence it may be frozen and when allowed to thaw for a few minutes can be cut and served that way. To give the cheese layer a little more interest I added about 1/4 tsp lemon extract plus a dash each of maple and almond extracts. These complemented the cherries perfectly. A for a simple recipe that tastes luscious and takes only minutes to throw together.",
