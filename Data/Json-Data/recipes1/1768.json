I, like some other reviewers consider myself a A+ baker, especially cakes. So, I would have felt bad if this didn't turn out well. But, I noticed that many others had success and I thought surely I could use their suggestions. I wrote out all of the suggested adjustments to this recipe and did those, and it tastes...well, heavenly!\nIf you don't want to go through all the reviews, here's the adjustments...\nUse 1&1/2 cups of milk instead of just one. Wait till the other ingredients are mixed before you make your meringue, and then fold it in rather than beat it. \nI also made a few other adjustments to make mine low fat. I used skim milk, and light butter with canola. I made 24 cupcakes and they are wonderful!\nNote that the batter seems thin, but it makes up moist wonderful cupcakes.\nAlso, do make sure to notice that you are suppose to sift the flour first, then measure and add baking powder and salt, then sift all together three times. I'm wondering if some of the other reviewers didn't notice that you were suppose to sift the flour before you even measure it out to add the baking powder and salt. It could have been the difference. \nI hope you decide to make this recipe!",

I just made it for my office for someone's birthday, and we are all eating it up as I write this review.\r\nThis recipe makes a very rich, white cake with a very moist crumb.  \r\n  I do agree with the people who added an extra 1/2 cup of milk -- it's necessary. The batter probably would have turned out fine without it, but I thought it looked a lot better with the extra milk.\r\n  Another suggestion I would make is to flip around the instruction steps in the recipe, as I did.\r\n  I made the butter and flour batter first and then covered it with plastic while I whipped the egg whites into meringue. I feared that making the meringue first, as the recipe instructs, would cause it to run or weep or go flat while I was making up the other batter.\r\n  Overall, I really endorse this recipe if you need a white cake.",

It came out lovely and fluffy - and seems to stay moist with the amount of milk recommended, if kept tightly covered. Served it with fresh blueberries and sweetened creme fraiche one night and homemade hot fudge another - it's also great on it's own! Thank you, Carol!",

This is a dense moist cake & very delicious. I have found that half the recipe makes one dozen very generous-sized cupcakes. The baking time is somewhat shorter for the cupcakes--you have to start keeping an eye on them at the 25-minute point so the tops don't burn. My daughter (6 rs old) loves it even with the ready-in-a-can frosting from the supermarket. I have also used a home-made whipped cream type frosting with excellent results.",
