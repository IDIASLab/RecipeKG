For example like someone said, it is too bland I would add onion powder garlic powder salt pepper or even Worcestershire sauce. Also this recipe calls for for bitter ale and that is probably pretty important don't use sour types of drinks. For my taste there were too many sesame seeds it made it bitter. Also since you're supposed to deep fry these they tasted really heavy I would recommend some sort of vinegary or savory/sweet sauce. And one last thing, if you like the taste of mushrooms cut them pretty thick like about one centimeter because they shrink quite a bit and the flavor gets a little lost.",

We do Keto most of the time so I used these instead of potatoes last time I grilled steak. I used coconut and almond flour instead of wheat flour and Heinekin light beer which still has the very hoppy flavor but lots less carbs. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!",
