The recipe didn't say whether or not to drain the tomatoes so I didn't and found the end result to be more like the consistency of a stew. (Besides the fact that my Cajun husband pointed out that true jambalaya doesn't have tomatoes anyway.) So next time I would either drain the tomatoes or eliminate them altogether. Also it was way too spicy for our kids to the point that they couldn't finish their dinner so I would use less than the 1 T. of Cajun seasoning that is called for. This isn't nearly as good as my homemade jambalaya but I will keep the recipe because I typically have all of the ingredients on hand and it's easy to throw together on those days that you're rushed or haven't planned even if you don't put it in the crockpot until 1 p.m.",
