On my second attempt I added the zest a teaspoon at a time and tasted the batter (before adding the raw eggs) until I got the orange flavor right.  It ended up being about a tablespoon, just not packed down.  Also, make sure you don't get any of the white rind when zesting because it will make the cookies bitter.  It took about 10 minutes to bake for a chewy texture.  I will definitely make these again.  They're so yummy!! One more thing... put the batter in the fridge for at least 10 min before baking and the cookie won't be flat or hard.  These also freeze well.  I just balled them up and put them in a freezer bag.  Place the frozen balls on a cookie sheet and by the time the oven is preheated, the they're ready to go in.  It took an extra minute or two to bake. This way I can have fresh baked cookies any time I want.",

I would advise to check the cookies about 10 minutes into baking, as the 16 minute bake time was WAY too long in my oven.  I also added another teaspoon of orange zest for a little extra bite--though anymore would have resulted in a far too bitter taste.  Plus, I was very pleased how well these kept their shape on the baking sheet!  Nice recipe, thanks Rosina.",

First as most people before me already knew 16 minutes is way too long. I always bake most cookies at 9 minutes and they come out nice and soft. As well next time I'll be using baking soda instead of powder as that will also make them be a little softer. Also 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips AND the cup of nuts seems to overload it a little...try 1 cup of the chips and 3/4 cup of nuts. I also added an extra half cup of flour as the dough was pretty sticky. This is all personal preference though so if you like your cookies a little harder and full of chocolate chips and nuts then by all means follow the recipe! All said and done...good taste but needed some tweaking.",

I omitted the chocolate chips and used the zest of two large oranges. I also grated up 2 dark hershey's kisses and added them to the batter for a hint of chocolate and an interesting texture.
