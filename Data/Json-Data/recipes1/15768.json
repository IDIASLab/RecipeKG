As per the submitter, this IS very versatile! Example, I prefer bacon and accidentally bought microwaveable - which made this even quicker. If I did want sausage, like the previous reviewer, would use crumbled, not links. Added some flair by saut\u00e9ing some diced onions and peppers first in a little butter. Added a 1/2 tsp homemade taco seasoning to the saut\u00e9. Finally added the eggs and mixed in crumbled bacon. Used pepper Jack cheese. So good!! Hot sauce, salsa and sour cream all great dipping! Thank you for an easy and tasty breakfast recipe!!! A keeper!!",
