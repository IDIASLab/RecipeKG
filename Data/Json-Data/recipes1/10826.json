I also used monterey-jack cheese and added chili powder to the top. Excellent with changes!",

Roast them in your oven broiler till they blister, turning to get all sides even as possible.  Remove and place in a brown grocery bag, with the top folded over for 5 or so minutes.  Peel stem and seed.  \n\nThe other tip is to combine your ground beef with an equal ammount of PORK CHIORIZO.  Brown them together.  Make sure you cook thoroghly.  Drain grease and continue with original recipe.\n\nI also replace a small (1/3 portion) of the flour measure for the casserole \"glue\" with yellow corn meal, and add a few shakes of any mexican brand or tabaso type sauce to the batter.\n\nFight Night Favorite!",
