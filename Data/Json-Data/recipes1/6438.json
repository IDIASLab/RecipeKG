I would however double the spices if this was going to be the main course. I did add a small piece of cinnamon stick and ground 3 cloves to add. I also added 1/2 tsp. tumeric for color. Very nice balance of spice. I didn't think the pepper would go w/the taste so shredded 1 med. carrot instead and gave a beautiful color. Also tossed in a few pistachios during the second 10 min. simmer along w/the raisins and carrot. Potato was perfectly done and added it at the beginning of the simmer. This makes a nice dish and does make alot to feed 4 people by the time one gets the vegetables in there. Will make again. Served this w/\"Indian style sheeshk kabab\" and \"Red Lentil Curry\" here on Allrecipes and was a nice meal.",

With the various additions at different times that necessitated stirring I thought that the potato got kind of mushy. Next time I might cook the lentils and potato together separately with their own spices and stir it all together briefly at the end. The red pepper seemed an odd choice flavour wise; I would use a hot pepper next time. The spicing was nice but milder than I prefer so I added a liberal amount of garam masala after it was done which helped enormously. The leftovers re-heated well.",

I use a lot more vegetables than the original recipe calls for - about double the veggies for the same amount of rice. I use whatever veggies I have - always onion potato and peas but I've also put in bell peppers carrots celery (stalks and greens) and even broccoli. I also increase the spices. At the end I like to add some cashews. The hard part is getting everything to finish cooking together - it can be a delicate balance getting the potatoes and rice to fully cook without overdoing some of the veggies. I keep making it though - it's a great recipe to introduce lentils without being so unusual that it scares off pickier eaters:)",
