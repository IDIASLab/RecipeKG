An easy, one-bowl recipe. I've also been in a hurry and baked it immediately after mixing and it turned out just fine, along with getting the beautiful crackles on top. I dip the tops of the dough balls in sugar b4 baking and sprinkle a little on top after it's done. I also use 50/50 white and light brown sugar which gives it a richer taste. Spice amounts are also right on. For walnut size dough balls, 10 min. is the perfect baking time. My master molasses recipe from now on.  TIP - I'm quite firm about using real butter for all my baking recipes, but Molasses cookies is the one exception. Using shortening will give this cookie it's chewiness so I'd recommend NOT to substitute with butter.",

If you like a crispy cookie, let them go 2 mins longer.  They definitely go from being chewy to being crispy QUICK so watch the time!!  Also, just an FYI, I started out using coarse sugar sprinkles by Wilson (the decorator kind)but changed to the standard fine red sugar that you find in the grocery store.  The coarse sugar looked pretty but was too crunchy for this cookie.  ",

My father loved them,and my friend said they were the best ginger bread cookies she has ever had! My mother though, first felt they tasted a lot like fried oil, whick I think was because of the shortening, but then said they were good after a few bites. But I think next time, I will try them with butter instead, just to avoid the oil taste. Oh and they were perfect after only 3  hours of refrigeration. All in all, fabulous recipe! Thanks for sharing it!!!**UPDATE**: I have now tried them with butter instead, and they are sooo amazingly perfect! From now on, I will only make them with butter. ",

Ten minutes at 375 and the cookies were PERFECT; just the right amount of crisp on outside and softness inside. The texture could not be better and the taste was a perfect blend of spices (even though they were a bit too sweet for my husband) and a big hit with neighbors.

I could see if I was using a cookie cutter, but for these I didn't see the need.  They came out PERFECT!  Baked for 10 minutes so they would be a tiny bit crispy on the outside.

However, when it tells you to melt the crisco and then let it cool, you must let the crisco solidify all the way again (which makes me wonder why to melt it in the first place!)  If you do not, the cookies become the consistency of hockey pucks when they cool all the way.  The flavors are wonderful though.  I would attempt this recipe again, but not melting the crisco.",
