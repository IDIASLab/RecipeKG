It was easy to make and tasty. Prep time is right on. I dumped ingredients in the breadmaker right after I got this prepared and in the fridge. I put the pasta on a large plate then placed the steak on top spooning the remaining sauce over the exposed pasta. It looked beautiful with so little effort! This makes more than four servings but leftovers are a cheap lunch for me. I'll definitely make this again!",
