The heat and curry flavor were very mild (I had to make my own red curry powder as I couldn't find it anywhere local so I guess that could be part of the problem although with the ingredients in the mixture you would think there would have been more of an asian curry-type flavor) so next time I think I will increase either the curry paste or the powder - don't think I should increase both initially or I could have something that only my husband will be able to eat! I also did not puncture the steak before marinating as I find that it tends to dry out on the grill when I do that (it could be the way DH grills his steak but we grill a lot of flank steak and never have a problem with it drying out) so I marinated it for 2 hours at room temp - so next time will increase that to 4 hours or so or maybe overnight in the 'frig if I get started early enough. The fresh basil at the stores looked too sad to use so I used about a 1/2 tsp dried in the marinade - couldn't really taste the basil but I'm sure it added some depth to it. I was also thinking I might try adding a little lime juice as it seems to me that a lot of Thai recipes have some sort of lime or kaffir lime leaves in them. Thanks Chef John for a very good starting point - we will be trying this again - and next time with the fresh basil!",

I also liked that there was no added oil in the marinade to add calories and cause flare ups.  Six minutes on the first side was right on the money.  I did slightly less when I turned it over, and ours was pink in the middle, just the way we like it.  I placed the fresh basil on the steak as the recipe indicates, but the grill was so hot it dried out very quickly.  We didn't get much of the basil flavor at all.  Now that I have all the ingredients, I will make this again.  Thanks, Chef!",
