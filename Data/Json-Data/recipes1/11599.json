It taste very similiar to the salad served by an upscale italian restaurant my husband and I frequently visit. I like others added more garlic and extra vinegar and reduced the salt to 3/4 teaspoon. The only change I would have made is to maybe throw a few black olives on top. Maybe I will try that next time. Note: I have made this many times so for a variation I used the Balsamic Vinegar dressing as someone else suggested. I like it much better with the dressing the recipe calls for. The Gorgonzola cheese does not taste as good with the Balsamic Vinegar.",
