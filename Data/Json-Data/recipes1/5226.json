Thanks for sharing!\n\n           ***Just made this for a 5th time & was asked for the recipe by my own momma. \nTIP: Bake at 350 for 1 Hr, flip the chicken over, baste with juices & pop back in the oven for another 15-20 mins to get a caramalized effect. And definitely use Catalina over French/Italian, trust me***",

Here's what I did: A cup of apricot preserves, a cup of Italian dressing, and in place of the onion soup mix, I made my own. I used 1 tbsp onion flakes, 1 tbsp meat tenderizer seasoning, 1/4 cup of chicken broth, a pinch of pepper, and a pinch of sugar. I combined all the ingredients and poured it over my chicken pieces and dropped small spoonfuls of butter over the chicken to help brown the meat. I cooked it for 50 minutes. During cooking, I also spooned the marinade over the chicken a few times. Very easy, very simple. Just make sure you TASTE the marianade before using it. If it doesn't taste good before you put it on the chicken, it won't taste good after either. Get the sauce to your liking.",

I checked mine after about 10 minutes of cooking and all the sauce had slid off the thighs and was burning, because of all the sugar, onto the baking dish. Thank goodness I had lined the pan as a precaution but a novice cook may not have known to do that. I re basted and turned them several times during cooking until I finally thought some of the sauce was on the chicken, not just the pan. That being said with lots of tending the final product was moist and flavorful. I think this dish would be much better by first browning the thighs and then putting them in a crock pot. If you are using the oven, put them in the smallest possible dish so the sauce doesnt just run of the sides. Oh my gosh, DO NOT forget to line the pan with foil.",
