The best way to balance the bitter is to add sugar I added about a table spoon of sugar sprinkeld over the fish. Second the bland flavor: I added crushed pepper and Parmesan cheese. Lastly one big mastake I saw people make was letting it sit in the marnade for way to long. Lemon juce will cook the fish and that will make it dry after u cook it. I only let it sit for an hour and it still had the lemon and rum flavor. After all that it ended up tasting awesome and flavorful.",
