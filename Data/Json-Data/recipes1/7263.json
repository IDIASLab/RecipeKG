As an alternative I took the 1/2 cup measure and filled it 2/3 full of honey and topped it off with molasses. This way the liquid measurements are the same as the original recipe without the corn syrup. Off the bat I used a deep dish 9\" pie shell. It's what I had on hand in my freezer and the filling fit perfectly. O my word my husband said if we were not already married this pie would cause him to propose!! I didn't make the whipped cream. The pie by itself is divine!! Thanks for sharing!!!",
