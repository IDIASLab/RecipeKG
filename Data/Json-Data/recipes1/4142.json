English cookery may be laughed at throughout the world, but this ranks alongside egg and bacon buttys on fried bread as one of the world's culinary masterpieces. Pupils would queue all lunchtime to have this, even though we knew that Nora, the chief 'cook' used to put her false teeth into anything she cooked for good luck. There is an Indian variation, based on 'qeema with peas' - if you like spicy food this will make your toes curl up.",

One disclaimer: I had to stop halfway through and resume cooking the next day as I did not have many of the ingredients that I thought I did. Instead of scones I used refrigerated biscuits for the topping and they were really good with the Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. But the lamb filling was lacking something and tasted very gamey. Also after baking it turned out very greasy. Both of these are possibly due to the quality of the ground lamb. Even so I would probably not make this again as much of it seemed off. I'd sooner make a standard shepherd's pie maybe with that biscuit topping.",

After adding the specified amount of butter the mixture was not even close to crumbly. We added what amounted to an additional 2-3 tablespoons to get the mixture right. Also my wife needed to add extra milk because the dough was just too dry. When it came time for us to cut the dough there was no way we could make the amount of scones specified with a thickness of 1 inch. We had to roll out the dough about 1/4 inch thick to make six or seven 4 inch circles. (Remember we cut everything in half.) In the end the meal was tasty but left us questioning the recipe.",

To cut the fat I dry fried the lamb then added the onion cooking a few minutes to soften then poured off the fat before adding the garlic and other ingredients. I added the peas frozen. (We get them in bags in the UK and the peas have been frozen individually so they pour.) Like other reviewers I couldn't get the number of scones at the stated thickness and needed to add a little more milk to make the dough workable. Fewer scones meant bigger gaps but there were still enough to go round. I also substituted cheddar cheese because my husband doesn't like Parmesan. We really enjoyed this as a nice alternative to Shepherds Pie. Will make again.",
