Since I was making two loaves, I made 'buttermilk' using lemon (1 tbl. lemon juice to one cup milk) and an additonal tsp. of grated lemon zest to add to the lemon flavor.  Also added vanilla extract.  Here's a helpful hint to eliminate the berries falling to the bottom of the loaf:  spread a small amount of batter in bottom of pan before mixing in the frozen berries.  Then with a very gentle hand, mix the berries into the remaining batter, then spread in pan.  It seemed to help a lot.  Also topped with lemon glaze (is it obvious we like lemon ... a lot?)",

We did make these a little different than the recipe asks--we combined all the wet ingredients then the dry with the blueberries folded in with the flour. It was just easier that way. We got 12 smallish muffins out of one recipe. My son wanted to make them a little prettier so he sprinkled a quarter teaspoon of sugar over each muffin mound before baking. These turned out well but lacking in blueberries. I think next time we make this recipe we'll double the blueberries.",

I've never floured the berries before and they never sink to the bottom so I'd say that that tip is no good at least for me.
