I combined the wet ingredients first, stirred together the dry ingredients and mixed gradually into the wet. These are cakey cookies. Watch the baking time. I use airbake cookie sheets with parchment paper and usually have to add about two minutes to my baking time, but not with these. I used a 1 TBS cookie scoop and made 44 cookies which baked for ten minutes. I used my own butter frosting recipe rather than the one from this site (tinted just slightly yellow and sprinkled with toasted walnuts.) Try toasting the walnuts before adding to the batter. Place walnut halves on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 8-12 minutes stirring every 4 minutes or so. Allow to cool, then coarsely chop. The flavor of the nuts is really enhanced. Thanks for a great way to use up ripe bananas. ",

But if youre looking for a mild cake-like cookie that you might have with breakfast (without icing of course) then you will like this recipe. I also have to add that the process of making the dough is new to me. Most cookie recipes will have you beat the butter/sugar and wet ingredients and then incorporate dry ingredients to it. I'm not sure why this recipe wanted you to add two amounts of flour separately but I just went ahead and mixed it the way i know.",

I don't like frosting (least of all butter frosting) so instead topped each cookie with half a pecan and a banana chip (making it absolutely clear what they contain). I then sprinkled the cookies with cinnamon sugar and the sugar caramelized on top making for a nice texture difference. I concur with the reviewer who said they're more like muffin tops than cookies. This batter is too runny for cookies with any shape. In doubling I added a half cup of flour to the mix and they were great. Tasty!",
