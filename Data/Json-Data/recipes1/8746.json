The bananas I used before were quite large.  The bananas this time were not as big and I only had the 3.  The batter turned out much stiffer than usual and I got a very dry loaf.  So use BIG bananas, or add extra if you have smaller bananas.  I guess a cup amount would be more accurate.",

I've made several different recipes and they've always gotten rave reviews but NEVER has my 3 year old son wanted to eat it...this one he does! I doubled the batch using 5 medium over ripe bananas and adding 2 tsp vanilla 4 Tbsp French Vanilla yogurt and half yellow half white sugar. Filled one loaf pan for bread then added semi sweet chocolate chips to the remaning batter to make one dozen muffins. Reduced the temperature to 325 F. Muffins took 30 mins to cook and were perfect! Cooked the loaf for 30 mins then covered with foil or 20 mins removed the foil and baked another 10 mins for a total of one hour. Also to make sure I had a nice moist loaf after removing from the oven I covered the loaf with foil for 30 mins...as I said before..PERFECT!!!!",
