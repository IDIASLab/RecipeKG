I then added the fresh green beans. All I had was a big can of whole tomatoes which I then cut up into small pieces and added them and all the juice. I cooked 1 cup of mini penne and then added that. I also sprinkled parmesan cheese all over the mixture then cooked it for a few minutes till it was good and hot. A couple of dinner rolls and you have a delicious meal. Very easy to make and very tasty. My family loved it. This definitely will be a keeper. Can't wait to make it again.",

I should have taken it further with spices. Overall this was good and it certainly was good for us. I used Allen's italian green beans from the can just simmered them right along with the petite diced tomatoes. I wish I had made a crusty french bread to go along with this meal or added pasta. I think the addition of shredded parmesan cheese would also be good. Thanks.",

I think you could add more garlic and/or more basil and make it even better. We used Italian style green beans (because I prefer the taste) but I'm sure any green beans work well with the recipe.",
