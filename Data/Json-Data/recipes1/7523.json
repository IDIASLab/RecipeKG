Like others suggested, I used only 1 can each of the beans (perfect amount), in addition adding an extra can of  tomatoes and used diced with jalepanos to spice it up a bit.  I also substituted 4 serrano chiles for the 5 regular (it was hot, but a GOOD burn!) and used 5 cloves of garlic.  Turned out I didn't have any parsley, but I don't think the dish suffered too much as a result.  It was awesome served with 7 grain wild rice that I cooked in chicken broth, 1/2 tsp chile powder, 1 tsp garlic salt, and a dash of old bay.  Thanks victoria!!!",
