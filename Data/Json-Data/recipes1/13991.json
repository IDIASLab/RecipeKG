There are different sized candy canes so I'd probably add 1 or 2 more because I really like minty but it was good just as it was. My 3 year old and 16 month old slurped theirs down like no tomorrow. For the person who complained about it not staying cool for 10 minutes our drinks barely lasted 5 minutes so I wouldn't know. My 16 month old literally just kept sucking it down until it was gone and I gave him about 6 oz. I also had no problems with candy cane pieces. I blended the milk and candy canes first and then put the ice cream on top so the candy canes were forced to be totally crushed. No one found a piece larger than a poppy seed.",
