I also used the Knorr beef broth that comes in concentrated form, one packet was perfect diluted in hot water. I meant to put cilantro in, but purchased parsley instead, tossed a bit in, this was also great, although I think I will try cilantro next time. I also let it sit for about 5 min or so, it thickened up wonderfully.",

I used kidney beans in place of black beans because that's what chili is in my world and had to call an audible and sub tomato sauce for the beef broth when I discovered we were out of broth (which I think gave it a perfect consistency!). While I appreciate the simplicity and what I think of as \"chili\" there was a little something missing but I can't decide what. Beef it's what's for dinner!",
