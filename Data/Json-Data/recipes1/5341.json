It was more like a fluffy version of sweet potato pie filling than a souffle as I think of them, but it was amazing.  It does lose its puff as it cools, but it doesn't have the texture of a fallen souffle and I actually think the flavor comes out a bit more when it's slightly cooled.  I boiled my carrots until they were super-soft and used a food processor, but still had little carrot chunks; didn't hurt the end result at all though.  Would make a great holiday dish!",

Very good recipe Carol.",

I really hoped this would work at our holiday table but it just didn't. Two servings were eaten and the rest got tossed. Carrot souffle might just be one of those things that you have had when you were younger to appreciate. Or maybe I just need to find a recipe that suits me. I don't know.",
