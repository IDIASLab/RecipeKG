The changes I made were: 1. I used individual ramekins so each brunch guest had his/her own dish. 2. I put some cubed leftover garlic bread in the bottom of each dish. 3. After pouring in the eggs I added a small handful of canned mushrooms. 4. I baked them in a 350 oven and then broiled them to finish with a nice brown top. Everyone loved them. I think the combination of the eggs and the evaporated milk worked really well. Next time I will try some onions in it.",
