I\u2019ve also used left over custard to put as a filling for my chocolate Reese\u2019s cupcakes with a peanut butter buttercream, it\u2019s so lush!  Everyone always raves about this pie, and love the fact that it\u2019s peanut butter custard, making it so decadent and smooth.",

So when I found this recipe I thought this is the one. And it was close with some tweaking to it. I followed the directions exactly how it was written. I stirred the milk egg flour and sugar mixture for 45 minutes and it never thickened to more than a little thicker than pancake batter. I poured it into the pie shell and it never set. After 2 hours it was still less than pudding like consistency. At that point I was running short on time and thought it can't hurt if I bake it. Which I did at 350 for 1 hour I covered the crust with foil and after an hour it was perfect. It had the consistency of a pumpkin pie. Everyone thought it was great and ate it all my grandmother didn't even get a slice. So I will be making anothr one today.",
