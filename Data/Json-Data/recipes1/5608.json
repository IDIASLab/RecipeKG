I've used this recipe for years mincing the garlic with 1 teaspoon of salt and with that small change the recipe is a five star-er.  Actually, a couple changes.  I buy fresh frozen shrimp (split and deveined but NOT peeled) and thaw them in salted water (brine).  Scientifically, this causes the protein in the shrimp to bind with the water and plumps them up.  Leaving the shells on protects the delicate shrimp from the high heat of the grill and although it's a little work for your guests to peel their shrimp, it's finger lickin' good!",
