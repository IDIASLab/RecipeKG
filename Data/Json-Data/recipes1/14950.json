I modified by using my cast iron skillet with lid. The hashbrown crust took 20 minutes on the stove, then the egg/chorizo portion took approx 10 minutes. The crust probably wasn't as soft as doing it in the oven but the rest of the recipe turned out great. I omitted the chopped onion and used onion powder vs minced onion. Very savory and yes it was gone in 1 day (I blame his dad...oh wait, that's me).",
