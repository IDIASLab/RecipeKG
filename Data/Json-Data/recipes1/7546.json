The gloss faded and after half a minute of hard beating with a big strong wooden spoon it went into the 8x8 buttered glass dish easily. It started to set pretty quickly and I used a hand-sized piece of foil to press it flat. A comment on the other review about the recipe not firming up - I instinctively added the evaporated milk by pouring in the whole can then remembered the aforementioned review and realized I the mistake. I was able to remove enough of the excess milk and thought maybe someone else might do the same hence this note.",

Beginners should look for a recipe that contains either marshmallows marshmallow fluff or cornsyrup. If you really want to make this recipe you need to do your research and go through a couple botched batches of fudge to make it work. For starters beating the fudge at the end is very important. Under or over beating will both lead to big problems in terms of how your fudge sets up. Do not stop beating until the moment the fudge starts to look less shiny then stop immediately and pour it out. For more tips you can check out the article \"perfect fudge\" on this site on the left of the screen. Hope that helps a bit.",
