I don't care for sweet soups I guess and I prefer to not make sweet potatoes sweeter... I took the premise of this recipe and instead of Allspice used Cajun spices in it's place (Morton & Bassett \"Cajun Spice Blend\" which is all natural \"salt free\" no msg etc.) as the bulk of my actual seasoning in this soup... I also used Cajun Classiques Creole Seasoning (DOES have lots of salt) to taste... I used 1/2 a healthier (lower fat) Kielbasa sausage vs. Italian or Smoked... I cannot tell you how outstanding this soup is! Essentially I am TRYING to cook Diabetic for myself yet my family keeps hounding me for this soup! The hordes descend the second I make this! Help!
