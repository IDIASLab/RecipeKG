Make it for birthdays at work (at least once a month) and recently for two baby showers.  Everyone thought it was bakery-made.  Was just asked to make it for a home wedding reception too (increased the recipe to 48 servings).  Couldn't be easier because of the carrot baby food -- no more shredding carrots.  What makes it even better is the frosting.  Used a combination of whipped cream and cream cheese (look in the frosting recipe section), and its not as heavy as cream cheese alone and it decorates and freezes well too.  If you had 10 stars, I'd give it 20!!!",

Admittedly I made a number of changes: - Replaced half the flour with whole wheat (nutty flavor and better texture) - Made my own mashed carrots by boiling carrots and blending the pieces - Added some fresh nonmashed uncooked carrots - adds a LOT to the flavor - Replaced about half of the oil with applesauce (homemade I just peeled and blended some apples) - Used fresh pineapple (or I would suggest get the canned pineapple rings and cut them up yourself - it was really nice to have small chunks of pineapple to bite into - Jumbo raisins from Trader Joe's - absolutely FABULOUS to bite into! - I also added a bit of nutmeg and ginger to balance the cinnamon",
