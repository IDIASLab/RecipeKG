I cooked the rice in the poaching liquid from the chicken, I threw in some shredded cheddar along with the veveeta, tossed in some frozen peas and carrots and topped in all off with some french fried onions instead of the cracker crumbs. My kids went nuts over it and my husband got up in the morning and ate it for breakfast. He said it was even better reheated. Thanx for a great recipe...this one is a keeper.",

What I used was 1/2 gruyere cheese and 1/2 good cheddar.\r\nThen I diced 4 large chicken breast halves into small bite size pieces and placed  approx. 3 cups of large sliced fresh mushooms in a bowl and sprinkled 1/3 cup of white wine on top and tossed the mushrooms and chicken to absorb the wine and let sit while I prepared the cheese sauce.\r\nI also prepared the rice using the water I had boiled the breasts in and strained it and added some chicken base.\r\nI would definitly serve this for company done this way and recommend having fun using the basics of this recipe to your own tastes. It is a keeper!!!",

In addition I took out the chicken bullion and used garlic and onion powder with the seasoning salt. For the topping I halved the cracker crumbs and added about 1/2 cup of shredded cheese to them for the topping. I also took out the butter which was not needed once the cheese was added I used sharp chedder instead of the velveta. I think the combo of velveta bullion and seasoning salt would add way to much salt to this dish. With the changes I belive it is a 5 star recipe but a 4 as written",

I don't think I'd add anything in the recipe per se but having peas and carrots on the side to mix in would be awesome. I would also put more of a crust on it--another cup or so of crackers should be fine since my topping seemed a little wet anyway. Overall really good though.

Chopped cooked chicken rather than shredded it. Mixed shredded colby jack and cheddar cheeses in with the cheese sauce. Only had about one cup of sour cream and it still worked out well. My son doesn't eat meat so made a portion for him without meat in one tray. A guest doesn't eat onions so put the crunchy onion topping only on part of it. Easy to adapt for nearly all picky eaters at the same table! Will definitely make again! Thanks!",
