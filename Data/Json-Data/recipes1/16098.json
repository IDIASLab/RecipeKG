                "reviewBody": "Fantastic! For those of you complaining about the spices add them AFTER you pull the wings out of the fryer before they cool off. Good spices are expensive and if you add them to the wing or batter before frying you will lose them in the oil. What you end up with is well seasoned oil which is useless. I mix the spices I like in a bowl and as soon as the wings are pulled from the fryer I sprinkle the spices I like on with my fingers. This also gives the oil a chance to rise back up to cooking temperature. I usually fry these for 11 minutes (4-5 large wings at a time) and I flip them after 6 minutes. I never clip off the wing tips. They are great for nibbling on. KUDOS to the author for this great recipe!",
