I used a basic french bread recipe and omited the oil and reduced the yeast to 1/2 teaspoon and let it rise only for about 15 min..then I shaped it into a rectangle and sliced off 1/2 inch thick slices and rolled into long 20\"X1/2\" or so ropes and then flattened into strips with a rolling pin...I had plenty for the project and enough to put a double braid around the opening. I just pressed the joining ends together and they stayed joined...be sure and overlap about half of the previous strip when laying around the body of the cone so you don't get gaps and brown it really well for a pretty look.",

I think the key is to spray the foil lightly with cooking spray - I sprayed it thick and the breadsticks tended to slide off. We ended up not using the egg at the end of each breadstick as that made it slippery as well; however we did use it to glaze. It turned out so cute and we had a blast making it. Note that you can make it up to a week and a half early - after that it starts to mildew. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
