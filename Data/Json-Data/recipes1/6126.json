I have since made this twice for home and potluck at work. I have been asked repeatedly for the recipe and it always gets rave reviews from everyone. It is a very flexible recipe. I've used different types of refried beans (chunky and black) both have been great! We have also used shredded Mexican or Taco cheese with great results. You will really enjoy this recipe!
