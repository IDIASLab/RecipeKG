A couple of comments to clarify the recipe instructions, however:  \"Proofing\" the yeast means that you must add about 1 Tblsp. of sugar to the warm water and yeast, then allow to double in volume prior to adding any further ingredients (I might not have known that had I not stumbled upon proofing instructions on the package).  Also, I found that it took a considerable amount of time for this dough to rise, so keep that in mind when you are planning for this to accompany a meal.  High heat was way too extreme a cooking temperature.  I burned the first few and ended up keeping the heat on medium-low.  This recipe had a wonderful flavor, and you could truly eat them alone with nothing more than a little butter.  Tasty!",

As I live in an off-campus apartment, I didn't have access to a real grill, so I tried the following:  1.  Cooking it on an open George Foreman Grill  2.  Cooking it on it closed.  3.  Cooking on a grill pan in the oven.  4.  Grilling it in a toaster oven.  The opened George Foreman was best.  And another tip:  Don't knead in the minced garlic.  Add it to the hot melted butter and let it soak in for 10 minutes or so.  Then apply the butter- it is delicious, and you don't have chunks of pungent garlic in some bits and not others.  I halved the recipe.",

I made it in my bread machine on dough cycle,using only 3 1/2 cups of all purpose flour as recommended by others, then removed it, made the balls and let rise about 1/2 hour. The SECRET to getting them to bubble is - when pinching the balls, pinch half in each hand, put the two halves together and then make the ball. Let rise, roll out and fry in butter. One more thing. I made these on a Monday and I had five balls left over so I put the raw dough in the fridge in a zip lock bag and four days later, just floured a board and rolled them out without even letting them come to room temoerature and they were just as good as the first time !Served them with lamb curry the first time and pea soup the second. I imagine that freezing them and letting them thaw would have the same results since there is so much frozen dough in the stores these days.Mine were perfect ! Thank you for the recipe. I have tried to make naan before with another recipe and it turned out heavy and blah. Thanks again - my husband just raved.",

The trick to having it bubble up and not be tough and chewy is to  roll it as thin as possible.  Then when cooking it on the grill only cook it until the grill marks get dark brown, do not let the whole Naan brown.  Aside from the grill marks, the rest of the Naan should still be white in color. It's the closest you'll get to the Naan they serve in the Indian restaurants.  Thanks so much for posting this Mic!",

Instead of grilling, I cooked the naan in a large saute pan after I brushed both sides with melted butter. Make sure you don't add too much flour when you're kneading, or the dough will be stiff. Add just enough flour to have the dough just barely clean the sides of your mixing bowl. If you're having problems with the dough not rising (maybe it's not warm enough in your house), try putting it in a warm oven (200F) with the door open and covered with a damp towel.",
