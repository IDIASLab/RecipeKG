You will love this recipe as written, but I have made modifications over the years that are also good. I prefer to use Jimmy Dean's Maple Sausage for added sweetness. I have also used cinnamon swirl, sourdough, and cinnamon raisen bread in place of the French bread, and I think they're all great. I also prefer to use Granny Smith (tart) or Honey Crisp apples for their crisp texture, and top with Gruyere cheese instead of cheddar (but both are great). TIP: Make it the night before you want to serve it, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Then pull it out and let it sit on your counter for 30 - 45 minutes before you pop it in the oven. Great for Christmas morning, so you can sit by the tree instead of in your kitchen!",

I used twice the apples Jimmy Dean Maple flavored sausage and used raisin bread instead of French bread as another reviewer had suggested. I drizzled maple syrup over mine as I have a SWEET tooth. My boyfriend - who is more for savory - preferred his without syrup and had THREE helpings. He LOVED this haha. I will be making this again I may even add some raisins next time as they were sooooo good in the bread. This dish did taste best once it \"sat\" for about 15-20 mins out off the oven. Looking forward to having this again on Christmas morning thanks.",

My variations: --I always add extra apple dices (the recipe doesn't call for enough IMO) --I go a little lighter on the cheese (to preserve the sweet french-toast-y flavor --I use homemade whole wheat bread instead of white french bread which results in a more solid (less soggy) french toast texture --I store it in the fridge already baked (not before baking as the recipe says) and then the next day I slice it and bake it up in the toaster oven for extra crispy exterior. The small as it toasts is amazing!:)",
