I omitted the vanilla and cream of tartar and added 1/4 c. finely crushed candy canes (down to pretty much a powder) and 2 1/2 t. peppermint extract. Then I rolled them in more crushed candy canes and sugar (probably about 1/3 c. and 1/8 c., respectively), and did not flatten them. They turned out extremely well and have become my favorite Christmas cookie this year!",
