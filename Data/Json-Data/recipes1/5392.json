First thing I did was read all the reviews.  I do this before I make anything.  I noticed MANDY added more flour, SHANN said hers were flat and TOOSWEETPEAS wants hers nice and poofy.  My suggestions: follow the directions on the box, keep the water at 3/4 cup.  Blend all ingredients together.  Beat one minute on medium speed, stop mixer and add a SMALL BOX OF JELLO INSTANT PUDDING MIX.  Beat another minute. Your batter will be thick, not runny.  Drop batter using a cookie scooper.  Bake around 14 minutes or when toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Your cakes will be perfectly round and NOT flat.  I fill my pies using a peanut butter filling.  To make the filling you DO NOT have to cook the flour and milk over the stove. What I do is I mix ALL the ingredients together except the shortening. I add this last and I use Criso butter flavor shortening.  You keep adding crisco until the filling is nice and fluffy.  You can substitute peanut butter in place of the vanilla.",
