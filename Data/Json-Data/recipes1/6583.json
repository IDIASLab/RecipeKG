                "reviewBody": "delicious recipe, great for the cold weather!\nI used a half pound of large shrimp and cut them in half.  I also added about 2T. parsley to the butter when i sauteed the onions and celery.  Because I used about 3 c. diced potatoes, I needed more milk (about an extra 3/4 c.), but the cream cheese kept the mixture thick.  One more addition I made was 1T. of old bay.  Excellent flavor! Will make again!\n\n1/3/10- I made this again today, a little more gourmet, but both equally as delish!!  I made a shrimp stock with the shells (adding old bay), once the stock was finished, I removed the shells and cooked the shrimp then used the stock to cook the potatoes.  I added some white wine (maybe a Tbsp) to the onion celery mixure while it was cooking, and added more half and half for more broth.  I did add about a half cup of corn niblets for color and because,,, well chowders and corn marry so well!!   OH I also added some lobster that was left from new years dinner :)  If you haven't made this yet, you really should!  Don't be nervous with the amount of cream cheese, it adds such a great, rich flavor!  And if its too thick add more milk, half and half, evaporated milk, shrimp stock or whatever you're using for the liquid in your recipe...  restaurant quality for sure!!",

I changed a few things I boiled the cubed potatoes in chicken stock until fork tender I used 3 cup of potatoes-like others added 1 tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning-added 1 can of corn-1 cup chicken stock an additional cup of milk and a few drops of Tabasco. I also served them in bread bowls GREAT RECIPE! I took some to my sister at work and her co-workers had her call me to ask where I bought it because they wanted it for lunch too =)!Thanks!",

This was better than he had! The first time I made it I added a can of cream of celery soup and a can of baby clams (drain juice to use/wash and drain clams) so it was a \"shrimp/clam\" chowder-delicious!! The second time I made it I used a can of Cambell's Cream of Shrimp (gave a pink hue) and a can of cream of celery. I only used shrimp that time. It was still fabulous! There is not one complaint about this recipe. It would be great for cool weather especially and for a nice dinner in a bread bowl! Thanks so much!",

Anyway, I found this recipe to be :\n\n- Very flavourful\n- Very colourful ( the celery leaves and stalks make a good contrast to the pink in the shrimp, against the white creamy sauce )\n- Very easy to make!\n\nHowever, I did change some few things to suit it to my taste:\n\n- I did not add the entire package of cream cheese.  I thought it was too much to do that.  I added a bit more milk though.\n\n- Instead of the cream cheese, I added 2 low-heaped tablespoons of sifted flour, as I was stirring the soup.  This thickened up the chowder quite quickly without the fat that you find in the cream cheese.\n\n- I also added a sage, thyme, dill dry herb mix ( around 3/4 tsps ) to give it that underlying flavour that goes so well with seafood chowders.",
