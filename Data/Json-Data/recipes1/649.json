I also decided that with the almonds and the heavy dose of vanilla called for in this recipe that I would make either true \"almond crescents,\" which is a popular cookie, or true wedding cookies. So, I used only 1 tsp. of vanilla and 3 tsp. almond extract.  I could not grind the almonds finely enough, however,so the texture of the final result was a bit too rubbery and bumpy with almond bits easily noticeable and getting stuck in teeth (at least mine), but this was probably my own fault. I'm sure that finely ground almonds would have enhanced my results (can you buy finely ground almonds? I cannot imagine grinding these by hand or machine such that they would truly be fine enough...the almond is very moist).\r\n\r\nThe flavor of these cookies was marvelous! Everyone liked them. Since I bake cookies almost exclusively as my Christmas gifts, I appreciated the larger quanitity produced from this recipe than most others I see. \r\n\r\nSo,a hit for this year means a tradition next year. \r\n\r\nThink I'll try them with ONLY the vanilla and pecans next Christmas (in addition to the almond crescents again). Thanks for a nice recipe.",

I used about a pinch of salt.  everytime Ive had wedding cookies (store-bought) I thought they were too salty. even with all the sugar though, I dont think they need that much.\nAnyway, after I finished rolling these cookies in the sugar, I realized that I left out the ground almonds.  Luckily, I used almond extract along with the vanilla and it still tasted PERFECT, you couldn't even notice it was missing it.  I ended up sprinkling the ground almonds on top, over the sugar.    \nAlso, I found it easiest to coat the cookies in a deep bowl, filled with the sugar, using a spoon.  If you use your fingers (and the cookies are still warm), it will stick and come off the cookie.",

As I'm always too busy, the first time I made them, I modified the recipe and made half the amount (40 cookies, less to be tempted by!?) but at the end I wished I'd made the entire amount as they were so good! \n\nI put the butter and icing (confectioners') sugar in the moulinex food processor, added the vanilla and only a half teaspoon of salt (which was fine), then gradually added the flour as well and mixed all together with a couple zaps.  \n\nThe mixture became soft, crumbly and I easily formed the balls quickly, and rolled them by hand. The entire process took less than half the time, too and they were all eaten in 10 minutes by the family who loved them!! ",

I wasn't sure how far apart to place them on the cookie sheet, but they didn't spread at all, so you can really load up the sheet.  I cooled them for about 10 minutes and then rolled them in the confect. sugar once, waited about 3-4 minutes and then rolled them again.

I also added 1 t. of almond extract for a bit more flavor. With a small food scale I weighed my dough to about a half ounce per cookie and the recipe made more than 80 cookies. I made the crescent shapes and they didn't \"roll in the extra confectioners sugar\" too easily so I put them on wax paper and sifted the powdered sugar over them. Also to finely chop the almonds I used a Black and Decker Handy Chopper. It chops about a 1/2 cup to 1 cup at a time. Just have to run it for at least a minute to get the almonds as small as it will chop. Final Note: Not your average cookie so don't expect the kiddos to go wild over them!",

I made the ground almonds by grinding up sliced almonds in my blender, it works well if you do it in small batches and scrape down the sides now and then.  The cookie itself reminds me of a biscotti but not completely dry - it has that puffy airy texture to it.  Very nice slightly sweet almond flavor, I think I'll try adding a little almond extract to enhance the flavor.  I used unsalted butter and added 1/4 tsp salt per the other reviewers comments.  They're very pretty and rustic - I plan on giving these as favors at my sister's bridal shower!  :)",
