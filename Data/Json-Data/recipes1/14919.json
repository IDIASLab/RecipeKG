This is a great base to get creative and use what you may have on hand or fresh from your garden. I used portobello mushrooms, tomatoes, zucchini, yellow squash, red and green peppers, and red onion. I also used pizza sauce vs. pesto. You can also add different types of cheeses as well like fresh mozzarella, Asiago, Parmesan or Romano. Chopped fresh basil is a great addition too - YUM!",

I did add sliced mushrooms to bf's pizza but left it off mine because I don't like mushrooms. I added red peppers to mine. Only issue I had was with the times but I think that's my grill--even the low setting is too high. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
