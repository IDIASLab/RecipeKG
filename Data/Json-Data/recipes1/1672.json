I made the cake in 8-inch layers for a nice tall cake. The filling is to die for and is reminiscent of an Almond Joy candy bar. I poured a glaze over the top of 4 T. butter melted with 5 ozs. of semi-sweet chocolate allowing it to run down the sides of the cake. Finally I topped the cake with toasted chopped almonds. Hubby was in his glory and said this was worthy of more than 5 stars the perfect combination of chocolate gooey and crunchy. I agree!",

I agree with other reviewers that there is a mistake in the frosting recipe section- I didn't try it but just reading it you can see there is something missing. I decided that I wanted a candy-bar type coating on this cake so I made a ganache from 1/2 cup evaporated milk 9 oz. chocolate chips and approximately 2 tb. water. This gave me a pourable consistency and I spread a thin layer over the cake. It had a dark glossy finish just like a candy bar but wasn't too sweet. Fantastic!!!! This is a keeper!",
