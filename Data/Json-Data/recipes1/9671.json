This is a recipie for a super-meat fan or a super-lamb fan -- one slice is a big gob of meat and the strong lamb flavor overpowers just about all the other ingredients. I also recommend using a very high quality feta because the cheaper stuff is a bit gritty when melted. I reduced the amount of salt (1 tsp instead of 2) as suggested by some posters here and found it needed salt. And ultimately I thought this lacked the requisite \"zing\" of gyros. It's definitley a recipie I will futz with but it's pretty ho-hum the way it is. My husband didn't even come close to finishing his small portion. Too rich and kind of \"all one flavor.\" I'd say: half to 3/4 of the meat increase oregano and cumin keep salt at 2 tsp. maybe add lemon juice and/or mint to meat mixture high-quality feta increase olives and zuccinni.",
