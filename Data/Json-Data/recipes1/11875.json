First I sprinkled salt on both sides of the filet, then covered the top evenly with onion powder, dill, and lemon pepper. It turned out fabulous. The flavors of the seasonings are mild enough to really let the taste of the salmon through. I don't know if the butter did anything for the fish though. This tasted wonderful, but it might be because I was using fresh king salmon from Alaska that a fisherman friend of ours brought back for us.",

Still, the steaks were generously sprinkled with all seasonings and it turned out just perfect.  It was very moist and delicious and my husband even commented that it was the moistest salmon he ever had, better than what he's been served in restaurants (where it was just too dry).  Even my 4 year old had seconds.  We didn't even need the tartar sauce and lemon; it was tasty by itself.  To make the clean-up a breeze too, I lined the baking pan with a sheet of foil.  I will be making this again; thanks!",

You should cook salmon based on thickness. Bake uncovered in a preheated 450\u00b0F oven for 4-6 minutes for each .5 inch of thickness.\" That advice has never failed me :)",
