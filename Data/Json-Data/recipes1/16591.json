That was better but they were still a tiny bit pink in the middle. When they were done I tasted one to see how it was. Hmmm okay but the teriyaki was sure a very subtle taste. I decided that rather than just basting them I'd make a glaze. I threw together some teriyaki a couple tablespoons black raspberry jelly along with some cornstarch and cooked it down a bit (sorry I don't have exact measurements) until it made up a glaze and threw the meatballs in there. It decidedly improved the flavor and the teriyaki taste. Without the glaze and the extra cooking time this recipe would have been a total loss. With the glaze I might make it again.",
