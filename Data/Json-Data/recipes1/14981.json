I sauteed the tuna in melted butter and seasoned w salt and pepper. After adding the milk & cheese, I seasoned the whole thing with garlic salt. For the garnish (to add some crunch)I put some Ritz crackers in a sandwich bag and crushed them (just a bit) then added about 1/2 c shredded cheese, shook it up and spread it on top. Put the pan in the oven on broil for about 1 minute--made it more casserole-y.  Tasted better the next day! ",

I lowered the milk to only half a soup can since I was cooking the rice. I used one can of peas instead of frozen (I'm sure most frozen or canned veggies would be great) and I added some seasoning and used sour cream and onion potato chips. So if you have to improvise this is a great recipe. P.s I think I'll try it with pasta next time.",

Then mixed in white tuna the mushroom soup milk sliced fresh mushrooms some garlic onion salt and pepper. Melted reduced fat colby cheese on top (less than a cup though). My kids don't like peas and I left off the fried onions/chips to keep it low fat. Served with green beans on the side. Both kids loved it and said to please make it again!!",
