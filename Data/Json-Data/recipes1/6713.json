(Since it's winter and quite cold here in Ottawa Canada I couldn't use my bbq so I used the oven instead).

Next time of course I will try to remember the oregano! Per some of the other reviews I halved all the marinade ingredients and had plenty for 2 tenderloins. I used fresh lemon juice to make it \"authentic\" Greek rather than lime juice minced about 1/3 of the garlic for the marinade & made slits in the tenderloins & inserted the garlic slices. We cooked it on our gas grill over indirect heat for exactly 25 minutes (to 160 degrees) and it was superb! Thanks Dave for this keeper of a recipe.",

I lay them flat in the fridge to marinate until the next day, then I transfer them to the freezer.  They make a nice quick meal, just thaw and grill/broil.\n\nTruth be told, I modify the recipe a bit. I use lemon juice instead of lime, and use 3 generous Tbsp each of basil and oregano.

Grease just prior to putting meat on (use enough towels so you don't burn yourself!).\r\n- use gallon ziploc freezer bags to marinate meat in. Turn over every hour or so.\r\n- put a meat thermometer in center of one of the tenderloins after turning...should just reach 170 degrees when done.\r\n- use fresh limes!
