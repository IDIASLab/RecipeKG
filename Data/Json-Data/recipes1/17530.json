It takes time and planning to make this a success. Follow the directions and make sure that the brisket is sealed tightly so that juices do not evaporate. It is well worth the time and trouble.

I used a smoker instead of the grill and did 10 hours in the smoker and 2 hours in the oven. It wasn't fall apart tender but brisket isn't supposed to be in my opinion. You need to be able to slice it. This sliced perfectly, was super tender, and the spice blend was very nice. The leftover held up well the next day too. I simply put it in the oven with its juices at 250 for 30 minutes.",

Prepared the rub exactly as stated, coated the meat completely, and placed it in my covered roasting pan (my grill isn't working).  Roasted it in my oven at 260 deg. for 9 hours (no peeking!).  The end result was a perfectly seasoned and extremely moist brisket.  The meat sliced beautifully (no shredding) and was incredibly tender.  This is my new go to rub!!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.",
