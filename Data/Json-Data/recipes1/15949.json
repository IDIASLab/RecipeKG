I didn\u2019t defrost them, and when this went into the oven, it had a lot of liquid in the dish from the pineapple juice as well as the blueberries starting to thaw.  It said to cook for 30-45 minutes, so I set the timer for 35 minutes, checked, and it wasn\u2019t even close to being done.  It took 1 hour and 10 minutes before the cake was cooked, and other than being a minor annoyance constantly checking for doneness, that\u2019s not a deal breaker with me, just need to plan accordingly.  If you use frozen berries, you may want to consider thawing them before adding to the cake.  On the positive side, it just doesn\u2019t get much easier than this, it\u2019s super moist, and it tastes good, even better day two.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, it\u2019s a keeper.",
