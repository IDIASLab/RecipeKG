The most important thing to remember is to make sure that you bring it to a boil AND THEN set your timer for 3 minutes.  My mum still hasn't figured that part out yet.  (hers separates in the fridge-- still tasty, but poor texture)  Everyone loves it, and it is so very simple!  I put mine on cinnamon grahams sometimes... they're a little sweeter.  My favourite is still the saltines, though!  You can also toss a handful of white chocolate chips on top with the dark chocolate, and swirl... it makes them very pretty.  I have relatives who are allergic to nuts, so I just sprinkle holiday jimmies on top, too.  Very versatile, and ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!\r\n\r\nAlso of note, try the Reynold's No Stick foil to line your pan! It works with no additional effort!  I use it for EVERYTHING!",

Sprinkle the chips on right after you take it out of the oven, let sit for just a minute to soften the chocolate chips and then using a spatula, spread the chocolate to completly cover the toffee.  Then add either nuts, sprinkles or even another flavor baking chips.  I use sprinkles for whatever occasion/holiday I am making this for.  If using other two kinds of chips, swirl it to give it a marble effect, don't worry about the toffee it can take it!",
