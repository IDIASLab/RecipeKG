Have fun with it : ) Also to use a a carrier , I used a clothes box (put together) and traced the bottom of the ice cream cone onto to it. (just a little bigger than the cone itself) Make the amount of circles that you need for the amount of cupcakes made then cut out the circles. I covered with tinfoil and poked the a hole in the center of the circle and tucked the foil underneath. This helped with the decorating to. Hope it helps.",
