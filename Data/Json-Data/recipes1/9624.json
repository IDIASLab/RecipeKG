Follow the recipe exactly, but after the 55 min baking time, turn the oven off, and leave the cheesecake in the now cooling oven for at least 1 hour.  It will not crack, and it will be firmed up in the middle.  It's best if eaten the next day, but no one will complain if it's only been chilled a few hours.",

I am not a big chocolate cheesecake fan usually (I like plain old New York Cheesecake)but I thought I'd try this for my honey's birthday!!WOW decadently sinful!! Very smooth creamy and rich just like truffles. I would recommend using the crust recipe given for this as it is much better than just a chocolate cookie crumb crust. I also used a 10\" springform pan. Came out flawless not a crack to be found. I put a pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake and left in the oven for about an hour after I turned the oven off!! I also baked it two days in advance and kept in the fridge. Serve at room temp. though!! Definitly a keeper!!",

I accidentally came accross another recipe at \"ALLRECIPES.com\" called \"Raspberry White Chocolate Mousse\" Submitted by: Stacey Walery.  I combined the two by makeing them each according to the submitted directions.  After the cheesecake has cooled, I had the mousse to the top and chill in the pan.  With the rasberry sauce you can make a beautiful plate presentation to really wow your friends and guests.  And, the mousse really helps to offset the richness of the cheescake.  You simply must give this a try.  Remember, a little piece of this dessert goes a long way.  Enjoy.",

I baked it for 58 minutes on a cookie sheet in a springform pan.  Instead of the crust suggested in the recipe, I baked a box of brownies for 30 minutes, then while hot I scooped the brownie out and pressed it into the bottom of the springform pan.  Then I poured the cheesecake in and baked it as usual.  After the cheesecake cooled, I mixed up a ganache (boil 1 cup half and half, remove from heat, add 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate and 1 ounce bittersweet chocolate, wisk until smooth).  I poured the ganache on top of the cheesecake and immediatly placed it back into the fridge for 30 minutes to cool.  This was AMAZING.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!",

I used reduced fat cream cheese but trust me you would have never known the difference. I would also recommend that you use a very good chocolate I used Wilbur semi-sweet chocolate. Also make sure your cream cheese and eggs are at room temperature to achieve that smooth silky consistency and I always add the eggs one at a time as I beat them in. The cookie crust is absolutely perfect I wouldn t cheat and use Oreos for the crust they just don t seem to go with the taste of a truffle.",
