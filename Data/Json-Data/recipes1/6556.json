I didn't use the tomato paste as I didn't have that much liquid from the tomatoes in the first place and I couldn't bear the thought of mixing canned paste with my fresh-from-the-garden veggies! Something I do first with my eggplant always is salt it. Slice it 1/4 inch thick layer it in a dish sprinkling each layer with salt. Put a plate over it and weigh it down. Let it sit for at least 1 hour. Then rinse and pat dry and continue with your recipe. This will take out some of the bitterness and make it less spongy. That way when you put it in your oil to saute it doesn't soak it all up in 2 seconds flat.",

My only complaint was the amount of cayenne pepper called for; I found it too spicy and while that's likely just personal preference I would warn others to be wary of 1/2 tsp and use a sprinkle instead for flavor's sake. Otherwise this is a delicious and healthy recipe I will use for years to come. Thanks for sharing!",

I oven-fried the eggplant- tossed the eggplant in oil in a bowl then placed on a parchment paper at 375 for about 20 min till golden brown. Less time mess and same results if you use enough oil. I also grilled the peppers in the oven at the same time. Yum!",
