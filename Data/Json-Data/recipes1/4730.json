I used all of the ingredients to scale but I added just a touch of sesame oil and a little more brown sugar. I was kinda worried that it would just taste like BBQ sauce but it didn't!:P The chicken was nice and tender and I would definitely use this recipe again when I'm sick of my \"other\" chicken recipe. And another thing: I used the recipe for only two bigger breasts and that was just enough. If you want a lot of sauce for four people I would double the recipe especially if you decide to reduce the sauce a little.",
