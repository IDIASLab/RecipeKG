A few tips in the interest of keeping it kosher for Passover: First use kosher for Passover wine. Anything made with grapes are very particular when it comes to the kosher certification and of course Passover comes with its own set of extra rules. Check your hescher! Likewise with the confectioner's sugar although unless you live in an area with a very dense Jewish population (like parts of New York) chances are good that your confectioners sugar has corn starch in it. Rather than hunting high and low and paying an outrageous cost for it toss a cup of white sugar into a blender (more if you're planning on storing any in which case add as many tablespoons of potato starch as you used cups of sugar to prevent clumping) and let it go until it's powdery and pour it out on to a plate or into a shallow bowl to roll the dates around in. (Or pour it into a jar for later use!)",

This would be great to put out on the table for people to pick at with dessert but i just stored them in a cookie tin for a while (They got surprisingly better with age!) I used white Eis Wein (ice wine) because that's what i had on hand. I think you can use just about anything even grape juice! Really delicious sooooo smooth and yummy tasting!! A bit sticky to form into balls though and the confectioners sugar didn't stick properly to them because of the moistness...Still VERY good and i will make this again!!!",
