I saute the potatoes in oil with some onions and garlic first, then added the rosemary and a little bit of cayenne pepper for heat.

We love roasted potatoes in our house, and these have so much more flavour than my usual method of tossing in olive oil, garlic and rosemary. I doubled the recipe and my husband and I were fighting over who got to finish them off! Adding the spinach is a nice touch - even the kids ate it - although I will be making these potatoes frequently with or without the greens. Maybe using the small red potatoes is the secret here; they were so soft and creamy tasting but held their shape nicely. And for sure the fresh ground sea salt and black pepper are a must. I shredded some asiago cheese over them before serving, as it was the hardest cheese I had on hand. I forgot the drizzle of olive oil, but they didn't need it. Fabulous potatoes, Lisa! Thanks for an awesome recipe!",

Freshly grated parmesan cheese sprinkled liberally on top is the crowning glory.  This one will definitely be a staple at my dinner table from now on!",
