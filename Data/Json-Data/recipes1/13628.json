I use almost the same recipe, but place the rouladen in a brownie pan, add a bit of water, then bake it for one hour partially covered. I do not put bacon in the rouladen and it still tastes wonderful.  I have found that it turns out better if you use the really hot and spicy mustard, sprinkle with coarsely ground black pepper.  (I like spicy foods, though).  Have never used the brown gravy mix as suggested in this recipe.  The drippings from the meat-onions-pickles makes a tasty gravy base on their own.",

I make the rouladen as described.  Then for the sauce I do a modified Sauerbraten Sauce.  I use 2  packages dry brown gravey sauce (we LOVE Gravy) make it to the specs on the package, I add to it about 1.5 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 table spoons Onion Powder, 2-3 Tbl. Red Wine Vinegar, 2 Tbl Worcestershire Sauce, and finally 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of ground ginger...  Allow the Rouladen to steam in this mixture to incorporate flavor for 20 to 30 minutes.....  I serve over noodles... Yummy!",

We use top round steak, sliced thin, secure with toothpicks, brown them in a skillet, place on a rack in a pressure cooker, add cleaned and quartered russet potatoes and cook at 15# for 10 minutes.  I then mix the drippings with sour cream for a sauce.  Any leftover potatoes (I always make sure there are leftover potatoes) are chopped and fried for breakfast.  I have also found that after browning, they can be frozen and later put straight into the pressure cooker, just increase cooking time to 12 minutes.  We actually prefer the firmer texture this creates.",
