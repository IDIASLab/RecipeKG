I've done several variations - one I like the best is to use the full can of frozen lemonade instead of the smaller lime ade and add the juice of a whole lime.  just keep the ratios of water and tequila equal w/the size of the frozen juice - use the container to measure (still one beer).  So simple!  Also, sometimes I put in Cointreau or Grand Marnier in place of some of the tequila - maybe 1/4 cup - it's sweet so keep it minimal.  I always serve mine on the rocks.  Or you can use another carbonated bev, such as ginger ale or one of those Smirnoff drinks. If you won't drink the whole batch in one sitting, just don't put the beer in to the pitcher; add it to each glass - that way you can save the batch for weeks and drink it as you want.  I think it's best if the mix is at room temperature so the ice melts some. One more thing - I recommend using a lighter color beer so you don't make it look funky.  Enjoy!",

Use a mexican beer, as someone else recommended. I accidentally used Corona Light (I hate light beers) and it was still just terrific. I went out and bought a set of margarita glasses on the strength of my belief that I will make these margaritas at EVERY party I ever throw for the rest of my life. Use the coarse kosher salt, by the way, for the glasses, because you can use that sort of salt in lots of other ways, rather than getting \"margarita\" salt. Much cheaper, just as good.",
