So I proofed the yeast then dumped everything else in and tried to knead it. (I'm kind of a novice at making bread...anyway). Well it was waaaayyyy to much flour and it turned into a hard dense un-kneadable mass. It was impossible to knead and I realize I should have only put in part of the flour and then added more as I went along. I went along with it anyway and set it in a bowl to rise. After 30 minutes and it hadn't risen at all I decided to start completely over because I really wanted this with dinner tonight. I chucked the first attempt and started over. Proofed the yeast w/sugar and warm water for 10 minutes then added the rest of indgredients except flour. I only added 3 cups of flour (including 1 cup of whole wheat) and it was a pleasure to knead. Soft smooth and pliable. I added more flour as I went along maybe another cup altogether. (Didn't put in any lecithin...whatever that is!) It rose beautifully this time and tasted out of this world! We ate it with Rich and Creamy Tomato soup and ate almost all of it! (I made the whole recipe and it made 2 8-inch round loaves not one. But I was glad it made a lot!). I will make sure to write down my notes because I WILL be making this bread again!",

If you chop a fresh tomato and saute it in olive oil with fresh garlic and some salt, then spread that on top before baking, it would be identical.  The first time I made it, I baked it for 20 minutes and the top was definitely golden, but the center was still doughy.  The second time I baked it for 25 minutes instead and that did the trick.",

I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of adding a few more Italian herbs. My Bread Machine usually gives me excellent results with this recipe it had a problem kneading the dough I had to keep loosening it with a spatula it was so dense then finally I added a little more water but it still kept seizing up possibly 4 1/2 cups of flour are too much? It took 40 minutes to achieve a light golden baked result and even then the bottom was still very pale. Although the flavor of the bread was good the texture was very dense and heavy the crust dry and hard. I used Bread Flour and Bread Machine yeast with an expiration date of 05/09 so I am at a loss to know what I did wrong possibly I should have divided the dough and made two loaves but I wanted a large loaf to use for paninni sandwiches. I'll have to try a different recipe.",
