What a huge disappointment - it was cloyingly sticky sweet with way too much artificial smoky flavor. If I were to make it again (which I won't) I would start by leaving the liquid smoke out. And cutting the brown sugar down a bit. But even with those changes I don't think it would be that great and definitely not worth the work involved.
