I also \"doctored\" the recipe a bit after reading the other reviews: For a half recipe I used 2 tsp. of cinnamon added 1 tsp. of nutmeg and added 1 c. of chopped walnuts. When the bread was done the walnuts had stayed suspended nicely throughout the batter. This was an excellent breakfast bread not too sweet and tasted fresh out of the oven after popping a slice into the microwave for 15 seconds and slathering it with real butter. YUMMY!",
