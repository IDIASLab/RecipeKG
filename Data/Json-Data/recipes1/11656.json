One is that the recipe was too rich for her guests and two she does not remark if the recipe was too reach for HER. Anyways the brownies are delicious. As far as being rich what do people want? I would rather bite into a brownie that sweeps me off my feet in one bite and satisfies enough to keep from eating them all at once instead of the brownies that are your everyday run of the mill brownies that you can finish in one sitting because they have the average chocolate taste. These brownies are superb. Don't even listen to Karen. If you do then add a little vanilla icing to balance the brownie out for a delicious treat. Don't pass this recipe up!!!",

These do not cook through in 20 minutes and end up being a mushy mess. I could have cooked them for longer but was afraid to because the cake mix had risen so much it was about to run over the sides or the baking dish. (it later collapsed back down into uncooked mush) Also I would recommend putting the chocolate and caramel on top of all of the cake mix because it's nearly impossible to spread the second layer on top of the gooey caramel and chocolate mixture. I just don't think cake mix was meant to make anything besides cake. This recipe stinks.",
