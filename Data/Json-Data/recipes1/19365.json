I just threw all of the ingredients in a blender, mixed, and poured into ramekins.  SUPER easy and delicious, I highly recommend.",

But today I am eating one that is cold and the pumpkin flavor is more pronounced and the consistency is more pleasant. I really like it better cold. Be careful not to over bake. I made some in ramekins and others in dishes a little bigger. I baked for 35 minutes and I think I should have pulled the ramekins at 30 min or earlier. If you over bake it changes the consistency. The ones I made that are perfectly baked though are very smooth and creamy when served cold. I would make this again but next time I'll make it the day prior and let it chill in the fridge overnight because I think it tastes better the second day chilled.",
