Thought the 1/2 C milk wasn't enough but the first time I usually make something as the recipe stands then NEXT time adjust from there. So yes it was a little dry but not bad. I ended up doing it in a stock pot that I could use in the oven as there was way too much for the 9X13 pan so maybe that is why it didn't totally dry out. The next time I'll cut the recipe in half unless I'm feeding a ton of people. Husband loved it though and ate two good-sized portions. It's a keeper with some modifications!",
