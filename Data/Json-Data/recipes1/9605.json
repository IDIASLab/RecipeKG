I did use a homemade pizza sauce. This was an interesting way to prepare patties--it's like a mixture between meatballs meat loaf and pizza. I had a difficult time keeping the stewed tomatoes in the patties and the mushrooms olives and pepperoni was a bit awkward on top even though it's held in place with the mozzerella cheese. Though it's not quite a home run for us yet the base recipe was great and I think I'll play with it a little to make it a family favorite.",

Since there is so much fat in the beef and pepperoni the pan should be drained about 1/2 way into the cooking. Also our cheese burned a bit on top- which might be due to our crappy oven! Perhaps bake for the first half without the cheese then add the cheese during the second half on top. Great recipe.. will make again and again.",
