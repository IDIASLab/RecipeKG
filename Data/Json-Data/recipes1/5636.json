Because of the beer (alcohol) when the juices ran out it caught onto the heat and thus created combustion. Not fun. In other similar recipes it does say to \"spread the coals to the outer edge\" or \"place chicken in indirect heat\". Well not to put all the blame on you because others were able to figure this out on their own but it should be clear that the chicken be put in indirect heat in this recipe as well. I was so exceited and now I have two carcuses in my trash can. (almost humerous give it time...)",

I have also rubbed the outside of the chicken with rotisserie spices and added a pop up breast timer to ensure doneness.",

The other one was only poultry seasoning on the outside and beer in the can.  This  recipe turned out producing a more moist chicken.  I don't know if it was the ingredients - I made one change to recipe.  My beer can opening came very close to the neck opening and I was worried that the beer wouldn't evaporate into the main body of the chicken... so I cut the beer can about 1/3 of the way down for this recipe.  Also, I roasted this in the oven- 450 for the first 20 minutes to crisp the skin and keep juices in..and then 375 for the next hour and a half.  Very tasty, I will use this recipe from now on!",

Omitted the mustard. I rubbed the outside of the chicken and sprinkled inside the cavity. I put the chickens into zip lock bags and left them overnight. Lined the grill with aluminum foil. Omitted the Italian dressing just used the can of beer. Took about a couple of hours on med heat on the gas grill. Covered top with aluminum foil when it got brown enough. Meat thermometer is useful. The whole family just raved! Juicy meat crispy tasty skin. This is a keeper! Thanks!",
