This is the recipe that comes off of the the Ocean Spray bag. Great bread for the holidays.  TIP - Be sure to cover the bread tightly with foil once it comes out of the oven for about 10-15 min.  It will steam and keep the bread super moist - a trick for all loaf quick breads.",

The base is wonderful and can be used with a variety of different fruits - strawberry, blueberry, cherry, dried mix, etc.  We prefer it without nuts and make it exactly as given except we use halved cranberries rather than whole.  We've used both fresh and frozen with no difference in quality.  When my husband first made this I was skeptical because I thought it would need more sugar and some other spices like cinnamon.  I was wrong!  The flavor is perfect as is.  The orange juice and zest give a sweetness and complexity that is just heavenly.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us!",
