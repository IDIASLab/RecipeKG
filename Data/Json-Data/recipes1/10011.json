Maple sausage doesn't taste quite right though.",

First I'll review this without changes. The first thing I noticed was that this does not make eight servings. If you are making this for biscuits and gravey, the recipe will makes only two servings. I make this for myself using half the recipe and gobble it up myself!  Second, it is just a tad bland but can easily be fixed by starting with a sausage with more spice. The changes that I've made are to saute some onions with the sausage and added several dashes of warchestershire sause to give it a little more zip. I also add a little of Jonny's Seasoning Salt. When I have no bacon grease, I use butter instead. I grew up in the South and had biscuits and gravy 'most every morning so I consider myself an expert gravy taster and I give this one five stars. :-)",

The bacon grease is the secret to the flavor of this gravy. My only change was to add quite a bit of salt and pepper. We love it so much we eat it for a quick supper all the time. We cook frozen biscuits in the oven and cook a bag of shredded hashbrowns while we're making the gravy. (We put the hashbrowns on top of the biscuits then ladle the gravy over all.) Mmmmm mmmm!",
