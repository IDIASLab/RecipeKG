My family prefers mozzarella over provolone so that is what I used. I served these with french fries and a variety of sauces like mayo bbq sauce sweet hot mustard and horseradish. Chips and salads would be great with these also. The croissant really enhances the appearance of the sandwich and I would serve this to company without hesitation. Thank you for sharing this easy and tasty recipe.",
