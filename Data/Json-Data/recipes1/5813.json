After reading all the comments about people not having this jello salad set up properly, I decided to add the jello to the hot soda & melted marshmellow mixture.  (Jello needs a hot liquid to properly disolve.)  Then I creamed together the room temp cream cheese & mayo with my hand mixer before stirring it into the mostly cooled soda, marshmellow and fully disolved lime jello mixture.  Lastly I folded in all the other ingredients until well blended (I substited shredded cocconut for the chopped pecans since I was taking to a putluck & some are allergic to nuts).  It set up beautifully and I had wonderful comments and even a few requests for the recipe.",

I also had no trouble with it setting and I'm wondering if those of you who did put water in your jello instead of putting just the dry jello in the marshmallow/beverage mixture just after letting it cool slightly so the jello dissolves. I also brought my cream cheese to room temperature and creamed it & the mayo with my mixer then added the still warm jello/marshmallow mixer to it on a low speed until the cream cheese dissolved.
