Never make oatmeal without it-brings out the flavors.  Microwaved for 5:30 mins. on high.  Added 1 Tbs. maple syrup at end.  Omitted cinnamon sugar.

I also added a little salt which helped bring out the flavors. It was still really bland so I added extra pumpkin and doubled the amount of pumpkin pie spice. This helped a lot. I also sprinkled the top of the oatmeal with a generous amount of extra cinnamon sugar. With these alterations the oatmeal is very very good. The pumpkin gives it a smooth almost velvety texture. I will be making this again but with these changes. Thanks for sharing!",

Instead of using pumpkin pie spice, I use the three traditional spices for pumpkin pie: cinnamon, ginger and ground cloves.  I don't use cinnamon sugar either, I use crystaline fructose (which I use ion place of sucrose just about everywhere).\r\nIts one of my favorite breakfasts-- I started making it at the beginning of the fall semester when the weather started to turn wintery here in Wisconsin, now it's late June and I still by canned pumpkin regularly just so I can fix it.
