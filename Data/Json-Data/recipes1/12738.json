We have a bumper crop of Roma tomatoes this year, more than we know what to do with so I decided to try out this recipe and hopefully freeze off the extra sauce for the winter months.\n\nIt was fantastic! Only I can see why some folks might be having problems with this recipe, the recipe says \"10 Tomatoes' but does not specify how large the tomatoes should be. For all practical purposes, it should say \"10 large Tomatoes\" because the size and the amount of the other ingredients DOES make a difference! Having said that, I quadrupled this recipe (using the portion converter) since I had 40 very medium Roma tomatoes, cut down on the amount of peppers and carrots, I used chopped baby carrots too since that made it much easier to cut into small pieces. I also threw in 2 dried red chillies (you can get them from the Indian grocery) along with the bay leaves and celery stalks while the whole thing simmered, in order to give it a bit of a kick. I also replaced the Italian spices with fresh thyme and oregano like other posters had recommended. It was superb!\nIt freezes well too and can easily be warmed up and be added with either cooked ground veal or pieces of Italian sausage for a non-vegetarian sauce for later on.",

I carmalized the onions and omitted the carrots and burgundy. Also after the sauce had been cooking for two hours I poured it into the blender to puree it; my kids hate vegetable chunks in their sauce so I did this to disguise the other veggies! Sneaky huh. Also I added salt and used oregano thyme and parsley instead of a general Italian seasoning. Overall this was a great recipe starter for a tasty sauce!",

I used this sauce to make lasagna and with what was left I served as a side dish with Italian sausage.  This is a good sauce to make if you are serving to people who do not like spicy, hot. For just my husband and I, I would also include a tsp of red pepper flakes. Thanks for a good basic recipe using fresh tomatoes!",

I managed to get away with not using any tomato paste after simmering it for over 8 hours to reduce it.  I added a 1/2 cup of Romono cheese, and cooked the sauce with whole carrots and later removed them.  I pureed the sauce then added 3 drops of red food coloring to bring back the bright red color.

                "reviewBody": "Absolutely delicious !!!!!!     I used one red bell pepper instead of the green, only one carrot and no sugar at all.  I substitute the wine for \u00bd cup of beef broth.  As mentioned by other readers, I added more salt and double the seasonings and also added dried oregano, 1 dried red chille pepper and \u00bd teaspoon red pepper flacks.   Two fantastic hints that helped me a lot:  1) Make an x at the bottom of the tomatoes before put them in the  boiling water. It peeled so easily!  2) Blend everything after the first 2 hours.  I included the celery to be added to the puree.   My hint \u2013 Discard the bay leave and red dried chilli before you put it on the blender.  I almost forgot!  No more grocery tomato sauce for me. This is too good!",
