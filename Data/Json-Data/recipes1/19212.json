If you mix up the strawberries and tequila in a Vitamix there's no need to strain it for seeds - even simpler! I did decrease the tequila to 8 oz because I don't like it quite as strong and then added 4 oz of water - perfect strength for me. For the beer all I had on hand was Budweiser and that worked just fine. I will definitely be making this again!",
