I have made it twice now and the only changes I made were: 1.) instead of canned chicken broth I used the \"Basic Vegetable Stock\" recipe on this website (reallly good and easy too!) and 2.) I also added fresh spinach a few minutes before the soup was done cooking. The spinach in my opinion really was the finishing touch for this soup. The second time I made it I used cabbage instead of spinach and it was also excellent though I prefer spinach.",

Instead of a baguette I cut up some whole wheat pita in triangles and broiled them in the over for 3 mins...crunchy yummy and low calorie.
