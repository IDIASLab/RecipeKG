We put it in the oven covered with foil at 250 while the seder was going on and took it out after about 45 min. It was still moist and great. It was served on the buffet with everything else instead of as a dessert. I think that was my first mistake. It was really good and the consistency was great but I felt the sugar overpowered it. It actually had a sugar taste. There is a difference between something tasting sweet and something having a \"sugar\" taste. It did not go well with all the other food on the table. With apple and cinnamon you cannot go wrong so I am not sure that I would go as low as half the sugar but for tripling the recipe I would use just over a cup. I also took the advice of another reviewer and added an extra apple. I also opted to use Granny Smith apples. I cannot wait to make this again just with lower sugar.",
