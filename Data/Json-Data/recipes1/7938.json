I made this for Thanksgiving and put half of the mixture in jumbo pasta shells as suggested and served the rest of the mixture as a dip accompanied by salty crackers (I used Saltines.) When people arrived they didn't really know what to make of the shells (Are they an appetizer or are they something for dinner? Do we eat them with our fingers or with a plate & fork?) so they went for the easy choice - the dip. The dip went so fast that I took the shells aside scooped the mixture out and added it to my dip bowl. I knew it was good when my father who despises the idea of imitation crab meat kept going back for more even after he was told what was in it. It's rather thick but the flavor is fresh and the green celery and pink crab & shrimp make it pretty and appetizing. I'm savoring the glory of bringing a \"winning\" dish and will make this for future potlucks! Thanks!",
