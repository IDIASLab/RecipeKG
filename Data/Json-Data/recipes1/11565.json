THIS PIE IS AWESOME! We have already made 3 of these! We tried black cherry kool-aid first and is was super-sweet so the next time we used pink lemondade kool-aid it was lighter but still really sweet. Last night I used lime kool-aid and it was perfect. Light and not too sweet but hubby and my son still want to try grape and orange flavors. Good thing its still early in the summer! Two of my friends are already using the recipe also calling it a cheater key lime pie recipe. Thanks for a great quick easy summer recipe!",

It's called a Kool-Aid pie!\" He told her how to make it she bought the ingredients right then and made it as soon as they got home. The whole family loved it and she gave another friend and me the recipe last night. My kids will LOOOVVVE this! Thanks!",
