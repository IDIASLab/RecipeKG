Frozen corn can also be charred in a skillet- takes a bit longer than you might think it should go in first for this recipe. Heat of jalapenos does not increase with cooking it decreases markedly (try a piece raw if you don't believe me).",

Definitely do not shy away from this if you're concerned about the heat -- cooking the peppers mellowed them out significantly. In fact the next time we make this we'll add in at least one more jalapeno and possibly leave in a few ribs/seeds to punch up the heat. The recipe calls for a lot of butter and we found it to be too much. We started with 1/2 cup saw it was too much removed about 1/4 cup and it was still too much. I think I'd only use a few Tbsp next time. Also added in a red pepper for a punch of color and that was a vey good idea. This recipe is a definite keeper!",

Grilling this was the way to Go! My corn was not quite done after grilling so I popped it in the nuker for about 3 minutes to get it a bit more tender. I served this next to Mexican Egg rolls & Spanish rice. THANK YOU Denny.",

I roasted the corn under the broiler on a jelly roll pan and roasted the poblanos on the gas cooktop.  I minced them up without taking the skins off.  I did cut the butter down to 2T and after a pinch of salt, it was delish.  I will definitely make this again.",
