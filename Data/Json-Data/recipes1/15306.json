A few changes to make it easier, more nutritious, and fluffier.  I use 100% whole wheat flour (no white flour) I use instant yeast and I do add 2 tbsp each of dough enhancer, lecithin, and vital wheat gluten. This  bread is so light, fluffy, and delicious everybody just LOVES it. I don't do all the separate rising stages anymore, too much work, too much time, and too much mess. I just throw all the ingredients in at once, mix it up, knead it, put it in the loaf pans, (if you coat your hands with crisco this is much cleaner and easier) put them in the oven with the oven light on to rise, then when they are risen enough turn the oven on and bake them. It doesn't hurt them at all to be in the oven while it preheats. The loaves come out perfect: light, fluffy, and absolutely delicious.",

Also I varied mine after I got to know the recipe. You can replace any of the following ingredients (flax seeds cracked wheat and sunflower seeds) with equivalent amounts of old-fashioned oatmeal sesame seeds or even cracked bulgur cereal. For a nice fancy touch coat your cookie sheets with yellow cornmeal (makes a nice bottom crust on the loaves)!!",

I scaled it down to 18 servings so it would work in my bread machine and I used egg whites in place of the whole egg. I've made it with all whole wheat flour adding 1 T vital wheat gluten and it still worked. Works well to grind the sunflower seeds cracked wheat and flax seeds so as to hide them from young eyes who wouldn't otherwise eat them! Love this bread! Thanks Dee Dee.",

This recipe is VERY large so it may be better to have or even third it. I divided into 6 small round loaves like the recipes says to and baked individually on a small pan since my oven is tiny. I had to hand form the loaves because they were too sticky to roll out. I ended up using about an extra 1/2 c. of bread flour in kneading but it never really became kneadable. I ran out of bread flour at that point. Nonetheless the bread came out very good. I will make this again and do more subsituting. Maybe add dried cranberries with the sunflower seeds or walnuts and some orange zest.",

I proofed my yeast with the ALL of thw warm water and sugar in my mixer bowl. After ten minutes, I added the honey, molasses, melted butter (instead of vegetable oil, I'm out until payday), eggs and lemon juice then all the dry ingredients, beating well with the paddle attachment with each cup of dry, as the recipe stated. I had to add just a touch more of whole wheat flour, just to get it to form into a solid ball. I kneaded with my bread hook for about five minutes or so, then set in a large greased bowl covered with saran wrap and a towel on a warm heating pad to rise for an hour. After it had doubled, I pounded it down and shaped into a loaf and set it to rise in two loaf pans for a half hour or so. I baked it at 350* for about a half hour, maybe a little more. One of the best breads my family has ever had--even my husband raved about it and he's not much for \"healthy\" bread. My kids and I just loved it. EXCELLENT as breakfast toast. This recipe's a keeper.",

Turned out nice in that they rose nice they are moist not a brick of wheat bread as some can be pretty loaves but flavor is lacking. Maybe another tbsp of honey? I don't know it's missing something may experiment one more time.",
