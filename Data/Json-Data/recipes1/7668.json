The corn syrup will stabilize the sugar and prevent graininess.  The addition of water also helps the butter melt to produce a smooth, melt in your mouth toffee instead of the undesirable 'stick-to-your-teeth' feel.  I received this toffee trick from a caterer and it truly works.  Try it.  (I also make just half the recipe: 2 sticks butter, 1.25 cups white sugar, 3 tablespoons each of water & corn syrup. Add 1 tsp. vanilla after mixture is done and off the heat.)",

Dont be afraid to turn it lower than medium heat. I've had it burn on me using a family member's range that ran hotter than my own. A way too tell if it's burning in the beginning is once you've stopped stirring it watch it for about minutes or so, if very dark bubbles start to pop up in the center, it's too high. The center bubbles should have more of light amber color than a darker brown color. I hope this helps some of those having issues.",

A hint for those of you who had this turn out like grainy sugar--you have to pay attention to the weather.  In the midwest it has been very humid and warm this year.  Even though I am a very experienced candy maker, I tried to make toffee 4 times this month and it 'broke'--the mixture reached 275 and the butter began to foam and separated from the sugar.  I was convinced that the butter and sugar companies had changed their products.  I was very frustrated at the loss of time (and $$$).  I don't know any way to save it once this happens.  Like any cooked candy, humidity can ruin it (like divinity).  Don't make any cooked candy if it is humid, rainy, etc.!!",

Great-tasting, crunchy toffee.  I followed the recipe exactly, with no problems.  You can check your thermometer in a pot of boiling water to check its accuracy (should read 212F/100C).  Things I'll try next time, partly based on suggestions here: use a jelly roll pan for a thinner candy, drizzle with melted chocolate instead of pouring toffee over, almonds instead of walnuts, increase nuts to 1 1/2 cups or try grinding nuts in food processor and sprinkle over chocolate (like Almond Roca).  I had no problems with the toffee sticking to the pan (I sprayed with cooking spray).  I'd love to try other combinations (macadamia/white chocolate, milk chocolate/peanuts).",
