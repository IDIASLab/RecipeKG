I also changed the flours a bit adding more white and less whole wheat since I know my family prefers that. It turned out very well except that I will add a 1/2 tsp. of salt next time I make it. A bit of butter makes up for the lack of salt and it freezes well. The coriander sounded a bit odd to me at first but it goes well with the ginger and cinnamon.",
