My hound loves them...and she's 16 and pretty darn fussy!! I roll and cut them out different shapes to give her a bit of variety.

With all my grandkids great nieces and nephews around they're inclined to be on sugar highs most of the time because they're just the right size to grab a cookie from a little one. I decided to try this doggie bone treat. They really seem to enjoy it. I make the bones with chicken broth sometimes. They seem to prefer the beef more. After ten hours in the oven they tend to be pretty darn crunchy! Good jaw and tooth exercise! Thanks Juanita.",
