They are flaky, crunchy - very similar to shortbread except cinnamon-y.  I get RAVES anytime I make these.  So, don't let the negative reviews keep you from trying these!!\nThese are not traditional cookies...they are supposed to be flaky, crunchy, NOT leavened ( so for heaven's sake don't add baking soda)  Make sure they are pressed out evenly.  And don't take them out too soon or they won't be crispy.  They are not supposed to be overly sweet either..sort of like Mexican Wedding Cookies.  The sweetness comes from he powdered sugar sprinkled on top.    So, if you want a super sweet, sugary cookie...this is NOT it! \nBut, if you want to try something different and you love cinnamon and pecans...then give it a try! :-)",

Our recipe calls for 1 1/2 softened sticks of butter/margarine and only 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon. We never added the vanilla extract but I will give it a try on the next batch. Nor did we top with the confectioner's sugar. What I always found the secret to be was to really work by hand the prepared dough until it is very moist all the way through. I would then roll it out on the well-greased cookie sheet. Yes it will be very thin but as you press in the pecan pieces it rises up a little bit. Watch them closely turning your pan half-way through the cooking time to get an even browning. They can go from golden brown to well done very quickly so don't overcook. Slice them into rectangles while hot in the pan and then remove with a spatula and let them cool on wax paper.",
