I believe she used baking soda rather than salt to soak the kidneys. She baked it in a very large, deep aluminum pie dish, and would place an inverted custard cup smack-dab in the middle of the lower crust before spooning in the filling. This held the top crust up and kept it from lying on the filling and getting soggy.",
