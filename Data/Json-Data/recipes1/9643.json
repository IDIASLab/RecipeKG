I prepared the beef last night (I bought & cubed 2 pieces of London Broil) & let it marinade in beef broth, garlic, seasoned salt, pepper and a decent merlot overnight because I knew I wouldn't be making this until today.)  The only variation was I tweaked other member suggestions and added 2/3 cup beef broth and 1/3 cup water to cream of mushroom soup, added additional mushrooms and 1 cup of light cream.  After simmering for 15 minutes, I added 1 cup sour cream (not fat free), dash of worstershire sauce, dash of nutmeg and parsley flakes.  AWESOME results...not thick at all, very rich and creamy and totally delicious. Kinda fattening with this variation but so what...you can work it off in the gym tomorrow which is what I will do!!! Will definitely prepare again!",

I cut about 1.3 lbs. into strips and marinated it for about 4 hours in 1/3 cup soy sauce 2/3 cup white wine 3 cloves garlic (I used the already diced bottled garlic) and some ground ginger. This made the meat very tender and it had an absolutely wonderful flavor! I then browned the meat in a little oil and added the onion and 8 oz. sliced fresh mushrooms. (The mushrooms really made this dish; I don't know how you could have stroganoff without fresh mushrooms!) After I added the flour and spices I poured in the can of soup mixed with a can of milk. (I still thought it needed some thinning so I made the mistake of adding white wine to the sauce. It would have been great with a little but I added too much and my husband complained that it was \"too winey\". Beware.) I didn't measure the sour cream; just spooned it in until it looked right. Served over egg noodles this was delicious!",

It was very, very good. Not bland at all. I did make the mistake of using cut of beef for stew, instead of hamburger, and the meat was tough.
