It upsets me when people rate recipes that they have made changes to before they have even tried it.

I followed this recipe as it was written, and they are a very nice oatmeal cookie.  For those who thought they spread out to much, look at the picture.  Mine turned out exactly like that.

After going through all the reviews of this oatmeal recipe I went to work to create my best cookie ever. Instead of 1 cup of butter I used just 1/2 cup and used pure cane sugar instead of brown sugar with just 3/4 of a cup. I added 2 cups of unbleached flour with 3/4 tsp of baking soda and small amounts of nutmeg and cinnamon. They were easy to mold and came out very shapely with a good chewy texture. I did not add walnuts but I added 1/2 cup of craisins to the recipe which came out very well for the first time making these cookies. I hope to make these oatmeal cookies again.",
