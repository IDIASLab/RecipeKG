They came out great. The dough held its shape well, and didnt require chilling before rolling and cutting. I found it very easy to work with.  I sprinkled one pan with cinnamon and sugar before baking- they were great! The kids used frosting on some of them. Since they are not super sweet on their own, the frosting isnt to much. edit to add: we've made this recipe a few times now. Its even better if you add the zest of one medium orange. It gives them a bit more flavor.",

It yielded nice soft cookies than browned perfectly in 10 minutes. The sugar on the outside gave a crunchy coating that contrasted beautifully with the soft centers. I also enjoyed how easy this recipe was to make. I didn't have any shortening on hand, so I just used butter, but they still came out very nice.",

The recipe implies that these cookies will spread to give the classic sugar cookie shape. This is completely untrue. If you roll them as written an place them on your cookie sheet, that's exactly what you will get when you take them out ten minutes later - a great tasting cookie ball. If you use your fingers to press them down, you'll end up with nice little impressions of your fingers. The taste and texture ARE fantastic (I followed exactly as written - except for not rolling in sugar since I plan on frosting mine) BUT you must dip the bottom of a glass in some fine sugar and then use this to press down your cookies. That's the only way to get the desired shape. Any imperfections when going into the oven will be seen when the cookies come out, so if you don't like ragged edges on your cookie - reshape with your hand while on the cookie sheet before going into the oven. And, yes, I did these large and small size - still needed to be pressed down and shaped by hand for looks. Definitely try this recipe for a wonderful taste and texture, but know that the directions are leading you astray when it comes to how to get the desired cookie...",
