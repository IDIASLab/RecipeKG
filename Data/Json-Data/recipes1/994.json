Finished size was 2 1/2\" diameter and approx 1/2\" thick. Don't watch for these to \"brown\" because they're too dark to see. Bake a few and time for 10 minutes and test them. Get your timing down for the remaining batches. Mine only took 11 minutes. Nice rolled in regular sugar but LOVED them rolled in the coarse SparklingWhite sugar from King Arth Flour's Baker's catalog. I think these would also be good dusted with powdered sugar after completely cooling. I'd make them again.",
