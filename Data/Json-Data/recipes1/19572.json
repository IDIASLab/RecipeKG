After reviewing other comments I did add a little more pepper and some season salt.  I also reduced the milk a little and added some sour cream to meat/soup mix.  Nice touch to the flavour.  I also saut\u00e9ed onion and the mushrooms before adding to the meat mix.   A definite keeper to our family menu.",

First, I used 1 lb. turkey and 1 lb. ground beef, then I added chopped onion, chopped red bell pepper, minced garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper to the ground beef and turkey as I cooked it.  I then mashed the potatoes and added to it 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, milk, salt and pepper.  I did not use the second can of Cream of Mushroom to pour over it (did not want it to be soupy). And when I layered it, I had plenty of meat to balance out the meal. I used more Cheddar cheese to cover each layer.  Then I only cooked in oven for 30 minutes.  Let it sit for 15 minutes.  AMAZING!!!",

Next time I'll add minced onions & garlic  also to hamburger while cooking. Also use more cheese. I only used 1 large jar of mushrooms & that was plenty.  Left off the French fried onions since I didn't have any.   Will make again with changes. Good middle of the week meal.",

I added 1/2 a small can of diced green chilis some garlic powder a bit of paprika and onion powder. I also used a 9x13 pan because there was 1.5# of burger and added extra cheese on the top. This will most definitely be one of my frequent dishes. The only thing I'd change is to cut the potatoes in more of a steak fry size vs. just slicing the potato.",
