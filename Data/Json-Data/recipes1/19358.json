Used low-fat cream cheese and turkey bacon - tasted great! First spread it into an 8x8 but that would have made the crm cheese layer too thick...scooped into pie plate as recipe called for. Next time will pull out of fridge about 10 min before serving to soften as Stacy's Pita Chips (thick!) kept cracking when trying to scoop up the cold ranch part. SO easy and inhaled by guests at the pool (and the lifeguards who enjoyed the little bit of leftovers; )",
