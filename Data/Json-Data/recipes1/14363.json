The only downfall is that it takes a bit of time preparing everything. Based upon previous reviews I made the following changes: used Italian herb bread crumbs instead of plain, added 4 minced garlic cloves to the mushrooms, served with fresh grated parmesan at time of serving. My friend and I both enjoyed the texture and overall taste of this dish. The calories aren't horrendous either (when served as a dinner meal). I recommend enjoying this dish with some steamed green beans. I plan on making this again.",

I prepared this sticking reasonably close to the recipe except for using seasoned bread crumbs more butter and lemon and sprinkling the chicken with fresh dill along with the parsley. I also added some fresh garlic and shallots to the mushrooms. However I knew the cooking time would be too long. More and more I'm seeing that chicken breasts vary in size so the cooking time can only be a rough guide. Mine were done at about 25 minutes. The chicken is tender and moist with great flavor. Served with \"Pasta with Swiss Chard \" also from this site this dinner was a hit.",
