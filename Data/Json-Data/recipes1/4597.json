The broth is going to be FAR too thin if you make it as written, you will need to double the flour (at least) to get a good, velvetty texture. I ended up increasing all of the herbs to at least one cup. Cooking the herbs/spinach for 30 minutes is extreme overkill; they really only need to be cooked long enough to soften and let the flavor out - 15 minutes, tops. In the end, this was a very servicable appetizer soup, but I think the idea could be put to much better use than this recipe. Thanks for letting me try it!  ",
