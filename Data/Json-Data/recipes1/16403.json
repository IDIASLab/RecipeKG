They were starting to get very brown, and after pre-cooking them and then baking for a long time, even at a low temperature, they obviously were done and glazed.  And I really don\u2019t understand the drain, double rinse with cold water, and then let them sit for 15 minutes in cold water before they go into the baking dish.  There simply were too many steps and too much time involved in making this dish, at least for me.  Don\u2019t mean to sound harsh, but I was expecting something extraordinary, and although they tasted good, they were very much like many other candied yam (or even carrot) recipes I've had which take a lot less time and preparation.  I know I\u2019m the first reviewer, and I don\u2019t mean to discourage others from trying this, but this is one I\u2019ll pass on for the future.",
