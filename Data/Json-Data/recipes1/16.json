Variations include:  cottage cheese, prune and apricot.  All are somewhat sweet and can be drizzled with a light powder sugar/milk frosting, but traditionally kolaches are not frosted.  I hope this is what you were looking for !!  If ever in Oklahoma, check out the Czech Festival in Yukon, OK.  The ladies of the community make about 2000 plus dozen Kolaches for sale during the festivities !!!",

This would be a great finger food to serve on a buffet or even as a dessert at a formal dinner. 2 things: 400 on my oven was a little hot. I turned it down to about 390 or so (just barely before the 400 mark) and they worked beautifully. Expect the finished product to have areas of dark and like sort of like macaroons (sp?). Secondly make sure the dough is REALLY cold. I eventually put mine in the freezer. Otherwise you'll have it sticking to your rolling pin constantly. Try other dried fruits. Plum immediently comes to mind but other fruits would work too. Be aware that if you use jelly (ONLY use \"all-fruit\" jelly if you're going to do this) it WILL run out of your kolache.",

I did find however the 2\" squares were a bit on the smallish side so I used a glass with a 3 1/2\" diameter to make circles instead. I also shook the cookies (after they were cooled) in powdered sugar. Next time I will probably add a little more flour and maybe powdered sugar to make the dough less sticky. Excellent recipe!",

Also the squares were difficult to manage so I rolled out a 9\" diameter circle and used a pizza cutter to cut out 12 wedges. This version looked great but the filling oozed out. So I cut out 3\" diameter circles and put the filling in the middle-then folded over and crimped the edge with a fork. This worked really well. OH the original recipe said \"6 servings\"...how many cookies is that per serving? Since I wasn't certain I doubled the recipe and it turned out that I got 4 dozen from it. So 6 servings was 2 dozen (not enough to share with friends and neighbors). All-in-all this recipe is great!",
