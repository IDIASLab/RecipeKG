I ended up using about 1/2 cup half and half since I didnt have heavy cream on hand. Either way 1/8 would not have been enough. Also 1 pound of mushrooms seemed like a bit much I ended up using 2 small cans of mushrooms instead. I just didnt saute them. Thirdly 5 teaspoons seemed a bit outrageous and this is from someone who loves pepper. I used about 1 1/2 teaspoons of pepper instead. Fourthly insyead of using 2 tablespoons of Paprika I started with one teaspoon and from there added a little more to taste. And lastly had I added 3 cups of cheddar cheese we may as well have had nachos so I just added about 1 1/2 cups. It turned out great!",

I used penne pasta used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream. I didn't have condensed cream of mushroom so i used condensed cream of potato and pureed it. I also used the can of breast chicken which already salty so i didn't use any salt for seasoning. Added some mozarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese. and seasoned with pinch of herbs for final touch. And it turned out really good!!",

Instead of canned cream of mushroom soup I made my own to avoid all the additives: sauteed some chopped 'shrooms in butter added some garlic and sauteed a few minutes more. Then added some flour cooked out the starchy flavor a bit then added some milk and then some chicken stock (which I boiled and strained after I poached and cubed the chicken for this recipe) and a dollop of sour cream. Seasoned with salt pepper and added some parsley. Tasted WAY better than the canned stuff YUM! Unfortunately the final result of the overall recipe was nothing that made us say \"wow.\" Seemed as though it was missing something but couldn't put a finger on it. Was alright but I don't know that I would make it again.",
