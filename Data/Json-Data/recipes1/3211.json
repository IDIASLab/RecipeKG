I let this roast sit for 30+ mins, to achieve room temp.  Following this, I rubbed this roast with the mcormicks steak rub, followed by smothering with dijon mustard.  Because I wasn't 100% sure HOW to cook this, I placed it in a 500 degree oven for 17mins, covered, following the 5mins/lb @ 500 rule.  At 17 mins, the roast hadn't even BEGUN to cook.  Uncovered, and returned to the same oven.  Mild smoke ensued.  Retrieved from oven after 11mins, and let rest to continue to cook. (Approx 15mins)  Began to cut roast, and noticed that, although it \"appeared\" cooked, the inside was still very very rare.  It is now BACK IN THE OVEN, over 1.5 hours after the original attempt.\n\nPeople, please, if you have a convec oven, or notice something particular in your cooking, please, please, please post it in your reviews.  I cannot give this recipe a decent review, as the instructions (5mins/lb@500 degrees) are, like I thought, simply untrue.",

Shut off for 2 hours (Also, DO NOT open door) Turn oven back on to 375 for 30-35 minutes. Tighly cover with foil and \"rest\" meat for 15 minutes before serving.",

Now I used a Whopper of a Prime Rib\u2026an 18-pounder.  I compensated for the size by using the 5 minute per # rule and it worked out superbly.  I stuffed tons of garlic cloves into the roast and also used Montreal Seasoning as well as a little extra Lawry\u2019s Seasoned salt because I like it so much.  I cooked my roast at 500 for 90 minutes and let stay in there for an additional 90 minutes after turning off the oven.  Definitely will use this recipe again and I am looking forward to tweaking it here and there to get different flavors.",

I put it in the preheated oven just as we left home for Xmas Eve services and man did the house smell amazing when we returned home.  Instead of salt and pepper, I use 'Montreal Steak Seasoning' which you can find at Costco.  I believe McCormicks makes it so you might find it in your local grocery store where the spices are.  Be sure to cover with foil before placing in oven.  Otherwise it gets smokey and can set off your smoke alarms...I speak from experience as I have made this at least 6 times in the past 6 months...usually when we entertain.  It gets rave reviews.  I flew some of my husbands friends in from New York for his 40th birthday in March...every single 'man' wanted to go home with this recipe to have their spouse/significant other make it.  It really is SO simple.  Also, if you have a local Meat store/butcher shop, get the rib from them, it's only about $1 more per pound and really does make a difference.  Enjoy!",

I know this receipe does work for some folks and their ovens but not for me and I wouldn't recommend anyone to take a chance blowing a 50 piece of meat and a holiday meal on this one! I get far superior results with the method whereby you pack your roast in a bed of Kosher salt cook high heat for 20-30 minutes then drop down to 325 degrees. Always tender and flavorful and no surprises when it's time to eat!",
