I chop an entire onion and saute it first in 1/2 Tbl. butter along with 1 tsp. minced garlic (the onions don't cook well enough for me otherwise and garlic adds nice flavor) then add them to the mixture. I lower the fat a bit by using only 2 cups of cheese (none really needs to be sprinkled on top) - another note - skim milk works well in this recipe. Be sure and thaw (then drain) the broccoli well or there will be too much liquid in the pie. I also add 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper to the mixture before pouring into the pie plate. Thanks for the recipe!",

To bump up the healthiness of the recipe I skipped the cheese on the top (there is plenty of cheese cooked in) and I used whole-wheat baking mix. Also there is no need to grease the pie pan. This recipe does not stick to the pan. I would suggest adding pepper or some other spice to the ingredients since it's just a tad bland. Also as a note the broccoli does not have to be thawed completely before you bake this. Just put the frozen broccoli in the microwave on \"thaw\" while you are stirring the batter and it will be plenty thawed by the time you are ready for it. As a final note you might want to try cooking this on the stovetop for a quicker cooking time. Just put enough of the mixture in the frying pan to cover the bottom and cook kind of like a pancake.",
