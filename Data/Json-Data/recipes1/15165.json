                "reviewBody": "Outstanding recipe! My husband is from The Netherlands and he is also Indonesian. During our last family reunion the family made us a wonderful Indonesian meal and the Sate was my favorite his too. I really like the kecap manis and the sambal oelek. These are common ingredients in Dutch supermarkets as Indonesians are historically a part of the Dutch community. I recommend this recipe as it is very authentic. I also recommend preparing a peanut sauce to go with it as I have never had it without whether in a restaurant or at my in-law's home. The peanut sauce should be specifically an Indonesian sauce as it is a wonderful flavor of sweet and spicy. It is much different than Thai Sate and peanut sauce it's thicker for one. Just my opinion but after having the Indonesian version at my family's home I haven't ordered the Thai version since. My husband is very lucky to have grown up eating this type of food!",

It is not that authentic for the use of red wine and beef. Chicken or goat meat is more commonly use and red wine is avoided because we do not have a wine drinking culture and we're bound to the halal-ness of food to consume. Wine is not halal due to its alcohol content (though some people still drink it anyway). Thank you for posting this recipe. Looking forward to read some more from you.",

I skewered them alternating vadalia onion with the beef and hubs grilled to perfection. Served with a prepared thai (ok I know it's not completely authentic!) spicy peanut sauce jasmine rice and thai green beans. Soooo good and a company worthy summer meal. Loved this. Many thanks for sharing your recipe!",
