I didn\u2019t have no-salt-added tomatoes or reduced sodium chicken broth, so I used 3-10 oz. cans of Rotel and regular chicken broth.  I also used more onion (2/3 cup chopped).  I was concerned that the full package of taco seasoning would make this too salty, so I only used about half the package.  Well, it was still too salty, so I improvised by adding a half cup of heavy cream to diminish the saltiness somewhat.   Seemed to work out just fine.  The Rotel gave this some great flavor and a nice amount of heat.  Next time I might thicken this with a little corn starch to give it a little more body.",
