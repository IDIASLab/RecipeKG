Work with one or two at a time, shaking off excess water then toss into your bag of flour mix. This worked really well for me. I ended up with fully coated, crispy onion rings. Old review follows: These were really good for being baked. My flour didn't want to stick well and so I had only partially breaded rings when they were done. That didn't seem to hurt anything, though. They had enough coating to have a good crunch and with less coating, the onion flavor came through nicely. Also less coating meant less calories. I added some powdered garlic and onion to the flour mix. Great recipe!",
