Nevertheless I used fat free ricotta for most of the cottage cheese butter in place of the shortening and one teaspoon of almond extract in place of the lemon. They came out not unlike the almond cookies from the infamous Italian bakery nearby. Mine did not come out crispy at the edges - more a cake-like cookie. Still I thought they were lovely and my hubbie ate the whole batch in two days. Maybe add sliced almonds on top the next time? I came back to this review and made it 5 stars because I end up using this recipe so often. It's delicious with almond extract (1 t) in place of the lemon.",
