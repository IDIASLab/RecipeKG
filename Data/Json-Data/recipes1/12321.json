Third this is great for those watching their carbs. And last it's delicious! I used turkey cutlets but I think pounded flat chicken breasts would be better (hubby disagrees vigorously on this point preferring the turkey). I browned them for just a couple of minutes in a mixture of olive oil and butter and of course the minced garlic. I used fresh asparagus rather than frozen. Most important for the sauce I used part milk part water and added some fresh lemon juice which I think gave it a huge boost in flavor as well as a little tang. I had debated adding some fresh tarragon to make it a Bearnaise sauce (since I have it growing in my garden anyway) and really wish I would have. The good thing is that I can always try that next time since I WILL be making this again. Too easy and too good not to! I garnished this with a sprinkle of finely chopped parsley and the result was a dish worthy of serving to company.",
