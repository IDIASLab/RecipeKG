Before adding water, season it with salt, pepper, thyme, and parsley.  Then a little dousing (1/4 to 1/2 cup) of white wine (chardoney) never hurt anybody.  Do this before the water is added too.  To thicken add a roux or substitue heavy whipping cream.  Also, throw in some fresh sliced mushrooms (1/2 cup or so) to really get some great flavor going on.  I threw in shredded swiss the chedder for a little more depth and it worked.  Really worth keeping, the most effort was in the chopping of vegatables.",

I also used Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic and added a couple of dashes of Mrs. Dash onion and herb.  Great recipe!  Will definitely be using this one over and over",

Used 3 parts chicken broth to 1 part water to make sure it didn't taste like chicken soup. Have used heavy cream & half & half they're both equally as good. Put the bacon in with the potatoes so the flavor sinks in. So many wonderful flavors my step-son who doesn't 'do' soup said it was the best he's ever had and loves it! I add garlic to most things but wouldn't for this recipe thanks! All my other inferior potato soup recipes are getting deleted from my box:)",

I sauted the onions and celery in the bacon grease, then drained the grease off.  After boiling the potatoes, onions and celery, I removed about 1/3 of the water.  It seemed like it was going to be too thin for my taste.  After combining all other ingredients, I simmered for another few minutes, then let it stand on the stove, covered.  It thickened up really well and was wonderful with bread.  Everyone loved this soup, and I will definately be making it again.  Thanks!",

It made a lot but we like it reheated even better. The only thing I would alter is if it looks like you have a lot of water left after you are done boiling the potatoes and celery and onions I would take out about a cup or two of water and then add the other ingredients. It will make it a little more creamy. But it was great just like it was. I just prefer creamier soup. I also topped it with sliced green onions. Thanks for the great recipe!",
