There's no way to get 10 servings out of 2 1/2cups of milk you have to double the recipe..I first warm the milk then add it slowly to the YOLKS and sugar(I don't use the whites!!) and cook it in a water bath there's no way to get \"scrambled eggs\" (it will take a little longer to cook). I always add some cinnamon along with the nutmeg it's always great!!! If you want eggnog that's not too thick...like some people said... just use \"light\" cream it's just as good!! \"Happy Holidays!!\"",

The purpose of tempering is to introduce cold eggs into a hot mixture - you slowly put a bit of whatever hot mixture you are working with into the eggs to gently heat them up so they do not \"scramble\" when you put the into the hot mixture. \r\n\r\nHowever, in this recipe, you are beginning with all cold ingredients and heating them together - you are not introducing cold eggs into a hot mixture and therefore tempering is not needed. If your eggs are \"scrambling\" in the eggnog, you are heating your mixture up too quickly. Turn the heat down a bit and SLOWLY warm your mixture up.\r\n\r\nI made the recipe as-is (without the rum). Everyone loved the creamy texture, and I loved the fact that I wasn't serving raw eggs to my family. The eggnog was even better the next day! In fact, what little remained got even better as time went on. Next time, I will make a batch a couple of days before I want to serve it.",

As I was making mine I was very careful to avoid this by heating slowly. However I did get lumps but not because of needing to temper the eggs. As someone stated earlier since the eggs & milk are both starting out cold tempering is not necessary. The reason for the lumps is that there is a very small window of time from \"coating the back of a metal spoon\" to lumps. I literally watched the lumps form because I cooked it for seconds too long. But not to worry. I let the eggnog cool and before adding in the whipped cream mixture I simply used an immersion blender on it and the lumps disappeared in moments. Someone else also suggested putting the nog in a blender or food processor which I'm sure would work equally as well. As for the thickness I doubled the egg/sugar/milk portion of the recipe but only used the 10 serving portion of the cream/sugar mixture. It was not as thick but made a wonderful consistency eggnog. I did not add the rum into the recipe as children were going to be enjoying the eggnog but we adults added the rum into our servings. Everyone was happy and the eggnog was a big hit. I will continue to use this recipe it's fabulous! Oops I almost forgot I threw a cinnamon stick & 1 tsp. of ground cloves into the egg/sugar/milk mixture and allowed it to all cook together removing the cinnamon stick before blending out my lumps.",
