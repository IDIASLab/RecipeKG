I used salsa con queso instead of the cheese sauce omitted the celery seed and carrots and added a can of black beans about half a package of fresh spinach (chopped up in the blender with the vegetable broth then added) and 1 c of salsa. I garnished it with shredded cheddar and a bit of cilantro and WOW what a tasty dish! I feel a lot better about the nutritional value too with the beans and spinach added. The spiciness of the salsa completely overrode the flavor of spinach. I will definitely make it over and over. Thanks for the base recipe!",

I have had cheese soups in restaurants and have always wanted to find that great recipe to make at home but am always disappointed. I would say this is it! Here are the slight changes I made: 1 can of vegetable broth double the potatoes used the Kroger brand jar of processed cheese added 1 clove minced garlic and I made it on the stovetop. (Since I made it on the stovetop I sauteed the veggies in a little butter before adding the broth)Oh I like others added the creamed corn when I added the cheese. Excellent thank you!",
