I had never thought to do it with a roasted chicken, however, until I read this recipe and thought, \"why not?\"  I followed the recipe loosly:  I made a mixture of chopped onions, chopped garlic, sage, ginger, a little bit of soy sauce, a little sesame seed oil and a little broth and put that inside the chicken.  I then covered the chicken with the sesame oil first and then soy sauce (not the oil at the end like the recipe, which makes no sense to me... the oil keeps the chicken moist), added about a cup or so of broth to the pan and let it cook... I did cook it for a half hour at 400 and then for another hour and a half at 350.  I made gravy with the drippings/broth mixture, which ended up being the BEST gravy to ever come out of my kitchen, but I didn't use this recipe for the gravy... I made it with flour (actually Wondra) and the pan stuff only.   The chicken smelled GREAT the whole time it cooked, and looked awesome... the oil/soy sauce made the skin beatifully brown and crispy, the inside was SO moist.  The gravy, like I said, was to DIE FOR (served it over the chix and white rice).  This meal was really awesome.",

I made the following modifications after reading the reviews: I reduced the soy sauce to 1/2 C and the sesame oil to 1/4 C, I also added 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper and 1/4 each garlic powder and ground ginger to the soy sauce before brushing it onto the chicken. I added about 1/2 C of chicken broth to the pan to prevent the burnt taste that several others have complained about. My bird came out perfectly cooked and beautifully browned, and the gravy is heavenly! I would recommend the leftovers for a Chinese chicken salad... would've tried it myself but we had none! I do have lots of leftover gravy as the kids weren't interested in it, so I think next week I will brush the gravy over chicken breasts and oven bake them. Thanks for the recipe Lisamarie, it's definitely a keeper!! P.S. Serve it over Egg Fried Rice by Krista B from this site... you will be glad you did!",

I used other reviewers' suggestions and stuffed the chicken with chopped onion, garlic and ginger, moistened with a little soy and sesame oil. Next time I'll try stuffing this mixture until the skin of the breast as well. I rubbed the outside of the bird with the sesame oil first, then brushed on low sodium soy sauce. I poured one cup of chicken stock (not broth, which has higher sodium) in the bottom of the roasting pan, set the bird down into the pan, and roasted it at 400 for 1/2 hr. Then lowered the heat to 350 and let it cook for 1 1/2 hrs. The gravy (thickened with 2T. cornstarch mixed with a little water) was perfect, no need for any  add'l salt or pepper. Thanks so much for a great recipe I'll use over and over!",

To cut back on the salt, I used both low sodium soy sauce and chicken broth and to add more flavor, I seasoned my bird with onion and garlic powders, black pepper and a bit of ginger. To those who had a problem with the soy sauce burning on the bottom of the pan, all you need to do is pour in a little chicken stock and it will be fine. Delicious!",
