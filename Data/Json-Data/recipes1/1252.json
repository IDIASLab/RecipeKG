I have searched everywhere and experiemented and failed; UNTIL I FOUND BECKY'S RECIPE. THIS IS IT, THIS IS IT YESSSSS!!!! Your bread is only as good as the starter and let me tell you that this ladies recipe is the one and only!!! Don't try it any other way!! There is a few things that I do differently, after putting together initial starter (like she explains in her recipe) and it has set on the counter for five days when I feed it on the fifth day I feed it: (1 cup of warm water, 3 heaping tablespoons of potato flakes and 3/4 cup of sugar). I will then continue to feed it every 3 to 5 days; Disposing of or making bread with one cup of starter 12 hours after every feeding. Use her sourdough starter and sourdough bread recipe for ultimate sourdough bread. Thank you sooooo much Becky!!!   \r\n",

I have been making it for 12 weeks and have given it to so many friends and they are all making sourdough bread too. Its easy, takes 2 full days to get the homemade bread but soooooo worth it.
