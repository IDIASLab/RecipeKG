I doubled the heavy cream but kept the butter amount the same.  I then added in a few tablespoons of cream cheese.  I used 3/4 cup of grated Romano cheese and a large handful of shredded mozzarella to make it creamier.  I also added in 2 teaspoons of garlic powder for some additional flavor.  I then let that sit on the warmer on my stove and sauteed some chicken in garlic and butter.  I served the sauce over fettucine noodles and put the chicken on top of it.  Garlic bread on the side completed a fantastic meal!!",

It was too thick and too salty for me which made it impossible to add chicken to it. Because of the thickness we were already eating two servings of sauce each--any less would not coat all the noodles. Next time I will use less butter or at least use some unsalted butter and I might try using half-n-half instead of heavy cream. Either way my boyfriend said he'd pay 15 for it at a retaurant! Best compliment he ever gave me...!",

                "reviewBody": "Amazing! this is my go to alfredo sauce period. some tips: if you use a canned grated parmesan like Krafts use unsalted butter and use about 1/8 cup less. Canned is saltier and its stronger. do try to use fresh hand grated parmesan in you can get it... when you taste the difference you'll be amazed. you can switch heavy cream or half and half or a mix of both. I've actually used just plain milk (with a bit more butter) there is a longer method of alfredo with butter flour chicken stock and cream with parmesan. Its wonderful too but for fast and easy this is the best! This is delicious but plainer side dish and I would seved with more complex main dishes. However if my main dish is just plain ie roasted chicken.. I'd punch this up a notch with maybe some spinach some garlic some mushroom... the varieties are many! This recipe as is deserves 10 stars.
