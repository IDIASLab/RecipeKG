I think one should try to give the recipe an \"as is\" a before rating so the rating is fair, but since I make chicken broth all the time and in the crock pot I am going to violate my rule.  I am dying to try basil in the broth having never tried it before.  It should be wonderful and why didn't I think of it myself as it is a natural for chicken?  lol!  As a tip to others, I buy whole chickens when they are on sale, throw them in the freezer and whenever I need chicken meat for a recipe I cook one in the crock pot.  I don't bother thawing, I just remove the outer plastic bag.   Also longer cooking concentrates the broth and makes it more flavorful, so those who had problems with flavor could improve it by longer cooking.  I usually start mine at night before I go to bed so it is ready to finish when I get up the next morning.  I use a large glass to hold a quart freezer bag open while I ladle the broth into it.  I do two sizes; a 3 cup and a 1 cup.  The one cup is handy for when a recipe only needs a small amount of both.  I remove the air from the bags and lay them flat on a cookie sheet.  Once they are frozen hard, stand them up on end and put in a shoebox sized plastic basket.",

After cooking all day, I let it sit in the fridge overnight and skimmed off the large amount of fat on top.  I used some in Vegetable Couscous from this site, and froze the rest in 1-cup portions to use in recipes.  It has a nice deep, rich flavor and made the couscous taste wonderful.  I have done this before with a chicken or turkey carcass.  I added a bit of salt (not too much though, I hate how salty store-bought broths are, even the \"reduced-sodium\" varieties...)

After it was done I placed the broth in the fridge overnight so that the fat could rise to the top solidify and I could just lift it off. Worked great. Used some then jarred up the rest and froze it. Homemade chicken stock is so flavorful and better yet I can control the seasonings especially salt that is so prevalent in the store-bought stuff! Thanks so much Micki!",

The broth turned out wonderful each time though the first couple of times I only made soups with it. I liked the original version best for making other recipes with the chicken except that I substituted dried parlsey for basil. After cooking it all day I strained the vegetables and left the broth with the chicken in it in the refrigerator overnight. The next day I skimmed the fat cut up the meat and strained the broth through a sieve lined with a paper towel. Half of the broth will be used with some of the chicken in soup and I froze the other half to make the Oriental Shrimp Noodle soup also on this site. I also made Angel's Chunky Chicken Salad and chicken burritos using Salsa Chicken Burrito filling both recipes on this site and both yummy. Four different meals from one recipe gives me a little variety as I'm cooking for two. Thank you for sharing.",
