The only suggestions that i have are: - when making the cream sauce add cheese to it it makes a huge difference since the cream sauce is bland. - try using small rotini noodles it bakes up great as well and it more filling - i followed someone else's suggestion and sauteed onions and the celery and it was a great addition. - without a doubt you have to triple this recipe. That made enough for one supper and one lunch (leftovers) for my husband and I which was perfect.",

Comfort food (bland but delicious and hearty) and great use of leftover ham and if we have left over roast chicken we throw that in too. I always chop some onions and sautee it with the celery. Occasionally I throw in diced carrots and peas. I eyeball everything now and put it in a 2.5 quart casserole dish which serves 4-6. About 2/3 box of noodles (10-12 oz rotini) 6 TBS butter 5 TBS flour sifted 2.5 cups milk Original review: Prep time may be 10 minutes if you have everything chopped already otherwise it took me more like 40 minutes as I was chopping celery and other vegetables I wanted to add in there (onions carrots and a bit of leftover broccoli). I sauted chicken breast cubes with the vegetables before adding in with the noodles. The sauce didn't thicken after 20 minutes to a consistency that made me feel confident it was going to turn out right so I added a bit of cornstarch. Everyone liked it and had seconds. I'll do it again the same way next time but I will allow more time for prep! With all the vegies it made a nice meal. I just had one side vegetable dish. BTW I more than tripled the recipe (added an extra cup of noodles on top of that) to make for 6 adults and it came out with just a little leftover.",
