I've used chicken, bacon, turkey, canned ham, smoked fish etc. It is never too thin I make sure that I have enough cream cheese I increased it to 300 grams as that is the size of the container I buy. I avoid using really old cheddar as it makes the dip oily but medium, marble or Monterey Jack works just as well or better. As written this is a good dip add some of your own twists and it's great.",
