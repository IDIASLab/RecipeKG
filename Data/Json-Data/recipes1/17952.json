I watched the video first, and I loved the idea of the little well in the center of the mushrooms to saute the shallots and to add the creme fraiche.  I'm certain that using Chef John's Creme Fraiche added to the wonderfulness of this recipe.  I wasn't able to find the variety of mushrooms he recommended, so I had to rely on criminis and whites, but they were really good.  I'll look for them next time!  I used brandy and Champagne vinegar.  Thanks for yet again another great recipe!",

My husband picked some gorgeous Chicken Mushrooms this past weekend and I had no idea how to cook them (besides the boringly obvious butter saute of course) and once again Chef John has come to my rescue! We wanted to use what we had so we substituted leeks for the shallots brandy for the Cognac and vinegar heavy cream with a little sour cream for the creme fraiche. The creme fraiche sounds Awesome but since I wanted to make this dish tonight I wasn't going to be able to make the creme fraiche in time but next time I am definitely going to make it in advance. We used about 8 oz of chicken mushrooms (which looked identical to the lobster mushrooms used in the video for this recipe btw) 4 oz of shittaki and 6 oz of portobellos.",
