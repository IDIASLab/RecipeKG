My husband a huge fan of Eggs Benedict was crazy about it which surprised me a little as he really enjoys a ridiculous amount of Hollandaise sauce on \"normal\" Benedict.

I thought the savory overpowered the sweet.  I guess I am looking for more of a monte cristo and less of a eggs benedict.  The second time I made it (again without the allspice and added a sprinkle of sugar to the batter) but didn't serve the poached eggs.  Instead I drizzled it with maple syrup.  The salty/sweet combo is perfect that way.  That is what I'll be serving at the big brunch!",
