It still tastes GREAT and you reduce the calories to about 290 calories a serving and the fat by OVER 1/2 per serving! (my husbands male co-workers ask for me to send this in about once a week and they have no idea it is 1/3 less calories, 1/2 the fat and less sugar then original recipe I sent in before) The orginal version is 6300 calories for the whole cake and 432 grams of fat. The reduced version is 3570 calories and 180 grams of fat for the whole cake.",

Using 1/2 cup of oil ups this to 4 stars. I used this as the base for \"Ho Ho Cake,\" also from this site. In addition to the reduction in oil, I used a devil's food cake mix and, for oomph in chocolate flavor and to disguise that \"cake mix taste,\" I used 1/2 cup of brewed coffee for the water and added 1 tsp. of chocolate extract. Moist and tender crumb, richer and more flavorful than just using the standard cake mix directions.  This was just perfect for what I was looking for.  ",

Why anyone would want to make this light I do not know. Live a little! Eat less, move more, and eat a variety of what you like in moderation people! Cutting corners by using light stuff or sugar free junk just isn't going to cut it. You won't be satisified and you'll eat more anyway. A little piece of this cake goes a long way.",

AND i even made the recipe MUCH lighter in calories so i'll share what i did for those of you who don't want the calorie-overload that the original provides. I used fat-free sugar free chocolate fudge pudding mix with triple chocolate fudge cake mix (already has some chocolate chips in the mix!). I used fat-free sour cream and only 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the oil. Also i only added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to the batter (because the mix already had some). with these \"lightening\" adjustments i only had to bake it for about 38 minutes but after cooling in the pan for about 15 minutes it came out easily and perfectly done! i glazed it with a combo of 1/2 cup chocolate chips 2 T. butter and 1 T. corn syrup but honestly that was the only \"iffy\" part of this glorious cake. believe what they say... it really DOESN'T need icing cuz the cake part is that good!! so i'd suggest just tossing that extra 1/2 cup chips into the batter as well. anyway i wanted to post this review for all of you wanting to make this cake but wary of it's super high-calorie content. with these adjustments it makes 12 (BIG) pieces at only 360 calories... not too bad for the awesome texture and taste!",
