I added seasonings according to their taste buds. Here are the extras I used to make a one dish meal. I sauted the onions slightly with a dab of butter before placing with the potatoes. Added just a touch of Ms. Dash with salt and pepper to taste. Brocolli and sliced mushrooms to give more variety for a one dish meal. However any vegetable or add in could be used to acheive the one dish meal use your favorites. Try using Cream of Chicken -or- Campbell's makes a Cream of Chicken and Mushroom together. They have many varieties available now. Instead of just pouring the sauce mixture over the top before baking. I tosssed it lightly among all the ingredients. Thank You Sara for the recipe. Even my picky 6 year old liked it. He will only eat tuna salad but tried this and ate seconds. I will be trying this again maybe mixing it up for other meats add ins etc...",
