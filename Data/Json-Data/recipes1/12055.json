I used Graham Cracker Crust III from this site as the crust and then chilled it in the freezer after baking it. To prevent runny or juicy filling I chilled the lime juice condensed milk and eggs so my lime mixture was cold and poured into the cold piecrust then put in the fridge. It set up very well after about one hour but I let it chill for about 3 hours before making the meringe. (I like HIGH meringe so I used seven egg whites.) After baking the meringe I again chilled the pie for two hours. When sliced it was very firm and well set. Pie was delicious! I would have liked it a little more tart lime flavored I could taste the sweet condensed milk. But I will make this again!",

The next time I used only 1/3 cup of lime juice and my husband said he liked it with more lime juice. Next time we will up the lime juice and just let it set in the fridge for longer. The meringue recipe listed here did not work very well for me so I used Meringue II from this site which came out beautifully. Will definitely make this pie again using the meringue II recipe.",

I didn't like the yellow-ish colour of the pie due to the eggs so I added a couple teeny drops of green food colouring to get the desired mint green shade (see my photo) I also used an OREO Cookie Crumb crust and although you would think an odd combination - it tasted fantastic! Citrus and Chocolate do go well together! Definitely a keeper of a recipe! I also only used 2 egg whites for the merengue as I don't like a ton of the stuff on my pies I left a border of about an inch all the way around so you could see the pretty green colour contrasting with the Oreo Cookie crust. Thanks for the recipe!:) Very east to do and very pretty to look at!",
