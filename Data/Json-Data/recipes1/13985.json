                "reviewBody": "I may have stumbled upon the problem some people are having with this recipe. It's the amount of evaporated milk.  When a recipe says \"one can\" I usually just go with what seems to me to be a standard sized can. But before I poured it in the saucepan this time, I checked the ounces. Whaddya know? To me, a can of evaporated milk is 12 ounces. But this recipe only calls for a 5 ounce can.  So be sure to check the size of your milk can!\n\nI personally LOVE the fudge you make from the recipe on the back of the marshmallow cream jars. But the cream contains eggs and my son is allergic. (Marshmallows themselves usually do not -- weird, huh?)  Anyway, this reciped turned out better than any other non-marshmallow cream variety I've tried.  It's creamy, sets up well and tastes nice and yummy. (With all that butter and sugar it ought to!)\n\nA quibble is that to my eye it never really lost its gloss. But I quit beating after several minutes anyway and it turned out fine.  No nuts for us due to allergy issues as well -- that can be a problem with some fudge recipes I've tried but not this one!\n\nTry this an be diligent about the milk measurement and you'll be pleased. And of course, as with anything with milk and this much sugar, forget the directions to stir \"frequently\" during the heat-up stage and just plan on stirring constantly.",

Use a bigger saucepan than you think you'll need, because it just about doubles in size as it cooks and you don't want any boil-over accidents.  I lined my pan with foil too so I can just lift the whole thing up, peel the foil off and cut it up on a cutting board.  When it says to beat until it \"loses its gloss\" I thought I hadn't done it long enough (it was still a little glossy), but it set up perfectly.  I love the crunch walnuts add to this. ******UPDATE: Made this again 12/20/5 with orange extract instead of vanilla, kept everything else the same.  It was SO GOOD!  Try it this way, or use your favorite flavor.  (Kept the amount of extract the same, using \"real\", not artificial, orange flavoring).",

                "reviewBody": "I have never had success with fudge until trying this recipe. It turned out so creamy and well just perfect. I got rave reviews by everyone that has tried a piece. I would suggest using a candy thermometer just to eliminate any doubt on when it is ready to take off the stove. I did a slight varation on it - First of all I doubled the recipe and left out the walnuts. I also used 1/3 milk chocolate chips and 2/3 semi-sweet (my personal preference). After I poured it into two pans I topped one pan with crushed candy canes and the other with walnut halves. Both versions went over really well but people seemed to really like the one with the candy cane on top. Very festive looking too. The only suggestion I have is to give a approximate time needed to beat the mixture. I wasn't totally sure if the gloss was gone but I had been beating for about five minutes (in a KitchenAid mixer) and was afraid of over doing it. It would have been nice to have a general guideline. Thank you for this recipe. I'm already planning on making it again tomorrow to give away as gifts.",

After five minutes I remove from the heat add chocolate chips and vanilla I blend with my portable handheld mixer. Then add nuts and pour into a foil lined and greased 8 x 8 inch dish.
