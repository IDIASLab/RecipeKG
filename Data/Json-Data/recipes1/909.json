I baked in two 9inch pans for 43 minutes.  I used buttercream fudge frosting from this site and it was soo yummy.  Always make chocolate cake a day or two in advance because chocolate cake taste better with age-the great chocolate flavors come out.",

The taste testers (my employees) have tasted good and bad cake and we were all in agreement that while it wasn't the worst cake, it wasn't good either.

I did use 4 ounces of chocolate rather than 3,  but only because I used a Ghirardelli 4 ounce bar - since it was unsweetened, I couldn't exactly eat the remaining ounce!  It's kind of middle of the road in color; not too milk chocolatey light, but neither is it deep, dark blackish brown - it's just a nice chocolate brown with plenty of good, chocolate taste, perhaps in part because I used hot coffee rather than the boiling water which makes the chocolate bloom.  It's very moist, with a more sturdy, compact crumb - in other words, it's a little heavier than what you might contrast with that of a boxed cake mix.  I was quite happy it.  I baked it in two 9\" layers, filled it with chocolate ganache and frosted it with a marshmallow buttercream.  Dare I say, it almost tasted like a Hostess Cupcake?  (Four stars rather than five, only because there are a couple of other chocolate cake recipes on this site that would trump ANY other chocolate cake recipe)",

I took the advice of putting in five squares of chocolate I wouldn't go any less. I didn't have all unsweetened chocolate so I used three semi-sweet and two unsweetened which worked perfect. I also used the Buttercream frosting found here instead of the Caramel Icing. I wouldn't change anything else! SPECTACULAR!!! Looks like no more cake mixes for me this is WELL worth the little bit of effort it took to make.:) Enjoy!",
