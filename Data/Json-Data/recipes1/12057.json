For the egg mixture I scrambled 5 eggs and 1/4 c. milk - omitting the egg whites and cheese. I mixed those with the sausage - vegie mixture along with a can of sliced black olives. When making the crepes I only used 2-3 T. of batter per crepe. I put the stuffed crepes seam side down in a 9x13 pan covered them with the hollandaise sauce and shredded mexican cheese (next time I may sprinkle the cheese on the inside of the stuffed crepes). I baked them at 350 for about 10 minutes - until the cheese was melted - and served with salsa. Time consuming but worth it!! Thanks for the great recipe idea!",

It was my first attempt at crepes and they turned out OK though I think I need to cook them at a lower temp because they started to cook before I got to swirl the batter around.
