It was the addition of onion and the cooking method itself, that caught my eye. I always saute the bacon and garlic, then add the COOKED green beans to the pan and toss   to coat. With this recipes's method, the green beans lose their vibrant color, the bacon gets limp, and the dish looks \"muddied\" overall. I'll stick to my method, where both the beans and the bacon retain their rich color and where the bacon flavor enhances, rather than overwhelms, the beans.",

Cooked the bacon whole first until it was crisp then removed from pan. As per other reviews only retained about 1 tablespoon of the grease.  When I added the beans and the water I put a lid on the pan but left it cracked which allowed the beans that were not in the water to steam, while allowing the water to evaporate.  When the beans were cooked and the water was pretty much gone, I returned  the crisp bacon which I had chopped to the pan and tossed, put the lid on tightly and just let it sit for about two hours.  I didn't want the beans to get mushy, but did want the bacon to soften up a bit.  Right before serving  I just heated it up.  Everybody loved it - will definitely make again.",

It was also a tad greasy so I felt like it wasn't as healthy as green beans should be.  Next time I think I will cook the bacon completely in the pan first, then set aside to drain on paper towels.  I will pour out all but a tablespoon or two of grease, and then cook the beans, onion and garlic in those drippings with the water.  Hopefully that will allow some of the other flavors to come out.",

Chicken broth vs water also gives a better flavor to the finished dish.  Easy to modify to your own family's taste buds, ie., add mushrooms, toasted almonds, even gorgonzola cheese.
