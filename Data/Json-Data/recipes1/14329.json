But everyone really liked it so I'm going to make it again but next time just use alittle less coco. I liked this much better than the store bought mixes that you just need to add hot water too. **UPDATE** I made this twice since the first time and I now make it with 1/3 cup coco, 3 1/2 cups water and 3 cups of milk... It's PERFECT!!! The kids keep asking for it. THANKS!!!",
