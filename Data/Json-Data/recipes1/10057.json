I sauted the onions with the beef because I didn't read the recipe closely enough....no problem there!  I sliced the potatoes thinly and layered it in a square dish with just over a pound of hamburger meat (seasoned with garlic powder and salt/pepper).  I ended up not having cream of mushroom soup, so I used the golden mushroom soup instead.  It really added alot of flavor in my view.  I would use the golden soup again.  Thanks for the recipe!  My husband finished the remainder of the casserole tonight!  No leftovers for us!",

(I reserve 5 star rating for more elegant fare) What I did different was add milk to the soup instead of water increasing the ammount to about 1/2 - 3/4 cup (didn't measure exactly). I salt and peppered plus added Zataran cajun seasoning to the potato layers. Baked about 1 hour at 300 potatoes weren't done and I was impatient so I cooked it another 20 minutes at 400 with no problems. I definitely recommend this recipe. I wouldn't do 2 cans of soup as some have posted. When you add the soup it looks like it doesn't infiltrate the top layer but as it cooks it makes it's way down. Adding 2 cans of soup would really increase the fat content. Again - mine came out great!",
