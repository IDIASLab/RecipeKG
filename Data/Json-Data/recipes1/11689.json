After reading the reviews I decided to use my electric skillet instead of trying to convert to the baking method. It worked wonderfully. I'm posting a picture of the cooking method not the the finished product because i think this is a recipe worth making and cooks should not pass on this recipe or be intimidated to try the ELECTRIC Skillet method. This Shortcake recipe is a WINNER!!! I've made it 3 times now and it has been eaten gone each time. I will NEVER buy those little grocery store shortcakes again!",
