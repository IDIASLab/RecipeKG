                "reviewBody": "First known as Better than Sex Cake, then Better than Robert Redford Cake, followed by Better than Brad Pitt Cake and finally (last I heard) cleaned up with the totally uninteresting Better than Anything Cake, this cake has been around a long time, evidenced by the fact this \u201cnew\u201d recipe calls for an 18.25 oz. cake mix which no longer exists.  (The big food corporations thought we were dumb and wouldn\u2019t notice)  There\u2019s also a variation using yellow cake mix and pineapple.  The chocolate variations, like this one, vary slightly \u2013 some, like this one, call for caramel topping (I use Mrs. Richardson\u2019s) and/or the addition of a half/full can of sweetened condensed milk.  I like this recipe because it calls for both \u2013 and the full amounts of each.  Some tips: I\u2019ve always used Heath Bars, only on the top, not in the middle, as this recipe directs.  Not sure I\u2019d like them in the middle too. When the toppings are poured over it\u2019s easier if you warm the caramel topping slightly \u2013 and fill in the holes made by the wooden spoon before pouring the rest over the entire cake.  To give you an idea of what goes on once you add the toppings, I remember a boyfriend my daughter had in college remarking that the cake was \u201cleaking.\u201d  There are little pockets of \u201cgooey ooze\u201d in every delicious bite.  This cake is beyond easy and beyond delicious.  I\u2019ve made this often for a good couple of decades. It has been a hit every time I\u2019ve made it and has been known to bring grown men to their knees.",
