I made this yesterday and my recipe (from a different site) calls for one additional step after it's removed from the oven.  I think you'll find it makes a huge difference in the finished product.  Topping: Spread each warm pastry with about 1/3 cup of jam or preserves. (Any flavor is fine, but our favorites are raspberry and apricot.)  Do this while the almond puff is still warm but not hot from the oven.  Then you sprinkle with the toasted almonds and drizzle with the icing.  I can't imagine this recipe without this step as it would seem very bland to me.",

As soon as I was an adult and moved away I had to hunt down the recipe for kringler as I love all things almond. =) This is exactly like the recipe that I have. I agree that for the first time it may look a bit complicated but it really is so easy. For the crust I just put it all down in a baking pan..I don't do the 2 rectangles. Also before stirring in the eggs one at a time I stir the flower/butter mixture a bit to let it cool down a little. (side note this is not an overly sweet pastry. The pastry itself is a choux pastry made like a cream puff almost. the sweetness really mostly comes from the icing)",

I sprinkled mine with red and green decorator sprinkles to make it look festive for the holidays. Yummy! My favorite of the Christmas cookie plate this year!",
