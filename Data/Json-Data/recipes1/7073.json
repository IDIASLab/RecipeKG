I only use about 3/4 cup brown sugar now, an dno molasses. I have also added finely chopped onions. When it needs a bit of kick I add jalepenos chopped very fine. This is to your own taste. (I have a friend that adds several, including all the seeds. He LOVES hot foods.) Thank you for all of your reviews. I have found each one helpful.",

It is incredibly delicious and people just can't get enough of it! We marinade half a rack of ribs with the marinade in tightly wrapped foil packets overnight then pop them in the oven for two and a half hours at 300 degrees. The meat falls off the bone! We save some of the sauce and spread it on the ribs after they cook in the oven and put them on the grill for 5 minutes or so just to carmelize and crunch up the outside a little. Unbelievable!! Give it a shot!;D",

We tried this one after looking over all the choices on allrecipes.com.  It looked questionable in the blender; it tasted questionable.  Threw the wings on the grill, basted.  Turned 'em over, basted.  Basted again-hubby is so meticulous!  Basically drowned the little suckers in the sauce, and still had about 1/4 left.  They looked great, they smelled incredible, and they tasted AWESOME!  Highly recommend this sauce for chicken!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I also added about half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes to make it a little spicy. I did heat it over the stove on medium heat for about 20 minutes, I think it helped the flavors come together better. The result was a really good, mildly sweet barbecue sauce with some kick to it.",
