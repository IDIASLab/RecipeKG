At this point you can add any vegetables you want, such as onion, potatoes, carrots, cellery, or even apple bits etc. \n3. Instead of water, you can use chicken broth, or a small amount of buillon to add more taste. \n4. More importantly, if you dont want your yogurt to currdle then you have to remove the pan from the heat when you add the yogurt. Too much heat will cause it to curdle.  Then just simmer for a few minutes over very low heat. \n5. Remeber that you can adjust the kind and quantity of curry to your taste. ",

I Sauteed the chicken pieces in a bit of olive oil and fresh garlic added some onion and carrots. Served over couscous this makes a simple and yummy dinner! HINT - To keep your yogurt from curdling either bring it to room temperature before adding it to anything hot or add some starch...a tbsp of flour or cornstach mixed into 1 cup of yogurt before adding it to the hot dish will do the trick. Also it's best not to boil or simmer yogurt..it's kills all of the good bacteria!",

First of all I bake this recipe on 350 for 1-1/2 hours.Instead of using water use chicken bullion (and about half of what this recipe calls for) more yogurt (be sure to add either flour or cornstarch to prevent the curdleing) and for the last 15 minutes of baking add fresh cut up tomatoes.

I was very careful to turn off the heat when I added the yogurt mix and I didn't heat it much at all after stirring it in just enough to make everything warm. Also I would recommend draining nearly all the water off the chicken. You can always add a little water back in if the sauce seems like it's going to be too thick. I used red curry powder instead of mild. Delicious!",

Sometimes even lowering the temp and adding corn starch does not help. Yogurt is a mild product. Curdling doesn't mean it's bad. Cottage cheese and Ricotta are curdled cheese products but there's nothing wrong them them or curdled yogurt. Mine curdled too. I ate it anyway and it was fine. I cooked it down to reduce the water content a bit. It does have some texture but tastes just fine. For those of you who don't realize this all the curds are is small bits of yogurt cheese which can be made by simply straining the water out of yogurt through cheese cloth. Curdling is just a hazard of working with cooked yogurt. Toughen up and eat it! There are too many people starving in this world to justify throwing food away without even trying it.",
