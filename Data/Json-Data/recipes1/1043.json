The chocolate chips on top are perfect for copping out of frosting it, but if you want to avoid chocolate overkill I think a non-chocolate icing would go nicely... Raspberry would really go well with this... Or you could maybe get, say, peanut butter chips instead?  But if you're in a pinch and need a dessert fast, have at this one!  The people you feed will tell you you're evil for tempting them with it.",

I have found that the finished quality is directly related to the kind of cake mix used.  If I use the cheapest cake mix I can find ... it tastes that way.  However, if I use a good quality cake mix such as Duncan Hines Devil's Food cake mix ... it is oh so yummy.  Also, it cannot be a mix with pudding already in the mix.  Those who have been unhappy with this cake, try it again with a good quality cake mix (if you didn't already) and see if you like it better.  I give this recipe 4 stars, only because it can be messed up.  A truly 5 star recipe is one that turns out great so matter what the cook does.",

I used instant jello without any issues and added 2 Tbs vanilla extract as well as 4 Tbs Bailey's liquor to address other's comments of blandness. I would add even a bit more of each next time. I also mixed the chocolate chips into the batter reserving a just a handful for the top. No need to frost just serve warm with ice cream.",
