The cakes turned out like old-time English crumpets or English muffins bubbly on top. I made a last-minute glaze of 2 cups confectioner's sugar 2 tablespoons of butter and 3 tablespoons of milk. They are very sweet even without the glaze and no hint of gingerbread. They go best with milk as they are very soft and moist slightly spongy (nothing like the cupcakes you are used to). Happy Eating!",
