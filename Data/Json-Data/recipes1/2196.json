I mixed the sugar and melted butter first, added and mixed the eggs, added and mixed in the vanilla, added and slowly mixed in the cocca, and finally added and mixed in the flour.  I used the amounts given in the recipe exactly. (just doubled) I had to bake these two for 52 mins. I am glad I used the Deep crusts, because the filling baked all the way up to the top of them.  I let them cool completely, then topped with coolwhip, and sprinkled the top with mimi morsels. They turned out beautiful and were awesome pies!  This recipe is a keeper!  *Update* I made this without melting the butter first and it ruined the recipe.  Melted butter is a must!!!",

I think it is better after it has been chilled and has firmed up a little. Per the earlier reviews I first creamed the sugar and (softened) butter then beat in the eggs and vanilla and finally added the dry ingredients. I had to bake it much longer than indicated - probably closer to 40-45 minutes. Next time I would barely bake the crust before adding the filling. The edges of the crust got a little dark since the pie had to bake so long. Next time I might try to add mini mint-chocolate chips to the batter before baking. Yum!!",

You'd never imagine that the brownie flavor goes so wonderfully in a pie crust, but it truely does.  Topping this slice of heaven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream is a must.  My family and I were a little leary of the initial \"looks\" of the pie, but the taste proved to be worth the (next to no) effort that was put in to making it.  I suggest creaming together the butter and sugar, then adding the eggs and vanilla. Once combined and smooth, add in the dry ingredients a little at a time.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.",
