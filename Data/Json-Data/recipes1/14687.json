I also had 4.5lbs of salmon and it was just the right amount so I imagine you can cut it in half for about 2.5lbs and fewer. Some said they changed it so that it wouldn't be that sweet. I didn't find it that sweet at all even with all of the sugar. I imagine you could come some of the white out. I put the fish in the brine for about 11 hours took out the fish and let filets sit in the fridge over night. I soaked cedar planks for 30 minutes in the brine. I smoked the fish for about 3-4 hours at 175F using a mixture of apple and hickory. It was amazing. Thanks for this recipe.",

I just never thought to brine that way. Thanks!\n   I made two batches.  For the second batch I cut down the salt by half, and added a half cup of Safeway's brand of Teriyaki Marinade, and added some Chinese chili paste. I smoked both filets using fresh cherry limbs, apple wood, and cedar.  The best fish anyone has ever tasted! Both excellent. Both unique. You can taste the citrus flavors right off the grill, but the longer it sits in the refrigerator the better smoked salmon flavor it gets!  (brine it for a full 36 hours if you can.)",
