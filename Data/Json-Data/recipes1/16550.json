The mushrooms were delicious out of the frying pan, but once baked in with the gratin, the finished product did not really marry well. If I do this again, I think I will go more of an Italian route with sausage instead of mushrooms. The recipe in my oven also needed more time to bake at 350 to get it nice and brown. It is a good base recipe for gratin- watch that hot polenta, though! It likes to pop!",
