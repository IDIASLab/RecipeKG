I made the topping as instructed but just before sprinkling over the fruit I mixed in about 1/2 cup of shredded coconut. Came out delicious!!

I agree with JosieV's comment regarding using Granny Smith apples; I even used (1) sweeter apple to balance it and the Granny's were still way too noticably tart. The crumb topping was just a bit disappointing too. I haven't had much experience with crumb toppings but this seemed too dry to me. Probably needed more butter. However I will make again this way because it was pretty healthy and still had four star flavor. And Shelley H. is right: it CRIES OUT for vanilla ice cream. I opted for Fat Free frozen topping (did not thaw) to keep the fat calories down.",
