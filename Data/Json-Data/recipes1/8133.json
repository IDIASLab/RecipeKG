Furthermore instead of garlic and seasoning salts I used salt garlic powder onion powder dried ground thyme dried dill weed celery ceed and mustard - each about 1/8 teaspoon but more of the salt. I feel that using seasoning salt which contains msg and unhealthy preservatives is defeating the point of marinating something myself. I would have given the recipe 5 stars otherwise.",
