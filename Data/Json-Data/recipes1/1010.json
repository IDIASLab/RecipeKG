This is HANDS DOWN the ABSOLUTE BEST cookie recipe I've ever come across.  The kids LOVE IT, my husband can't stop eating them - ALWAYS a hit.  Family and friends always want to know when I'll be making more!  I scale down the recipe to half, and the best thing about this recipe is that you can substitute in peanut butter chips, dark chocolate chips, toffee bits (my favorite!), etc... Never thin or flat, they cook up right - perfect texture every time.  With my 2 kids, I found it hard to stand over the stove cooking massive amounts of cookies - so here's what I do it; prepare the batter, set aside.  Get a larger piece of waxed paper or parchment paper and lay it out on the counter.  Place about 3 cups of the batter onto the paper.  Roll the batter into a round \"log\" and close up on the ends.  Make sure the log is even in width all the way through.  I then stick the logs in the freezer, and anytime I want some fresh cookies - I pull out a log, cut the cookies off in slices, and lay them on a cookie sheet - perfect!  Great for unexpected guests, birthday parties, etc... make them ahead of time!  Thanks so much for the recipe - I've been looking for this one for a LONG time!",

I always half this recipe though: 2 cups each of brown sugar/white sugar 1 cup each of butter flavored shortening/butter 5 eggs etc. I add a teaspoon of salt. Also I never add all those candies to this recipe. I usually do about 4 cups of chocolate chips white choc. etc. The combos I've made with these cookies: white choc. chip and macadamia nut reg choc. chip double choc. chip and pecan ( mix about 1/4 cup of special dark cocoa powder and about 3-4 tablespoons of oil in a cup until well blended. and add this choc. mix to 1/2 of cookie dough mix.) choc. chip and toffee bits choc. chip and snickers--I'm telling you this is a MUST try recipe and play around with it and make different combinations! I'VE EVEN MADE THIS RECIPE USING SPLENDA SUGAR BLEND AND SPLENDA BROWN SUGAR BLEND! Everyone RAVES about these cookies whenever I make them!",

We used M & M peanut's but did not add them until right before baking I pressed about 4 on each one and then also used non peanut M & M's and put about 6 on top press them in this way your M & M's don't melt or candy coating doesn't rub off into the cookie dough. So three huge 19 x 17 cake boxes later we had alot of fun and I can't wait to hear the responses as they are DELICIOUS cookies! Thank you for a great recipe!",

I also used Hershey's Kissables instead of M & M's and they were yummy!",

It made over 14 dozen cookies using a medium-sized cookie scoop with a baking time of 14 minutes per cookie sheet. I left out the nuts and used 3 cups of M&Ms 3 cups of chocolate chips and just over 2 cups of the shredded coconut instead. They were great! They stacked well in cellophane bags tied with Christmas ribbon - a dozen per stack was tall! Will freeze well too! I made them again last week and quartered the recipe (using 2 eggs) and it made just over 3 dozen - a lot easier to make in a small batch.;O)",

Once I got started I realized I didn't have enough brown sugar so I used 1 1/2c brown sugar 2 1/2 cups additional white sugar and 1/2 maple syrup. I also substitued 1 1/2 c crunchy peanut butter for part of the shortening and added 2 cups of raisins. These cookies stayed soft and chewy a long time and there were plenty around so they didn't all disappear in a day! I even put part of the cookie dough away in the freezer so we can have fresh cookies another day when I'm to busy to make them. After adding the oats I gave up on stirring with the spoon (which was ready to break!) and mixed in all the extra goodies with my hands. By the way I had to mix these in my largest stock pot it was the only think big enough to hold it all. YUM! Thanks for sharing this recipe it is a KEEPER!",
