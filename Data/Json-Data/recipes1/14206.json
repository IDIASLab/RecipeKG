I added a few garlic cloves to the potatoes as they were boiling. I wilted fresh spinach and used that rather than frozen. I added some cooked, crumbled bacon, used green onion and omitted the dill weed. At this point this dish was SO delicious and SO beautiful that I thought the shredded cheese would only ruin its elegance. The cheese, I still think, would have reduced the look of these potatoes to that of an ordinary casserole.  This was the perfect accompaniment to the \"Herb Crusted Chuck Roast\" and green beans. ",

I also mixed the cheddar cheese into the potato mixture instead of on top and it made for a better presentation of the dish. I felt it was a tad on the dry side so next time I make it I'll try red potatoes since they make the creamiest mashed potatoes, or I'll add a small amount of milk to the recipe. Update: I originally did this review back in 2008 and have made this many times. Two things that are really good that I wanted to share that I have since tried with this recipe is the addition of crumbled bacon bits and green onions instead. And on another occasion I have topped with Frenches onions pieces and that was a hit. Just FYI.",

I think green onions would have also been excellent in this dish. I am already planning to make this one a staple on my holiday table. It is a dish I will be proud to serve.
