When he got home and tasted it, he woke me up to tell me how wonderful dinner was and totally forgot that he was mad at me.  He told me it was the best tasting dish that I had ever made.   \nI also used 1lb of ground beef, browned it with 3 cloves of garlic and a small chopped onion.  I exchanged the water for beef broth. I chopped up a green pepper and 1/3 lg box of mushroom too (to clean out the fridge)and added that to the frozen veggies (which were also chopped into smaller bites). I added 1/3 can of kidney beans and two hand fulls of ditalini.  The 1/2c of red wine really topped off the stock. It was super easy to prepare and I will certainly be making it again! Thanks",

I browned the ground beef with onions and fresh garlic.  Instead of water, I used beef broth and also added a 1/4 cup of white wine.  I added frozen mixed vegetables with pasta shells.  I also didn't have any tomato sauce, but had pizza sauce, so used that instead.  This soup turned out very delicious!  Even my finicky 7-year-old and 3-year-old loved it.  Thank you for a quick, but delicious soup.",
