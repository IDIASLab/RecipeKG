I added carmelized onion and baked garlic to enhance what appeared to be a rather bland dish.

I suppose it could always be user failure but I followed this recipe to the T I didn't change a thing. The crust of the bread was VERY hard after the egg wash the inside of the bread did not even cook at all. The potato mixture yes I changed that a tad added some bacon bits and some cheese for personal perference a good thing too the bread was not fit to eat and was tossed out. We had mashed potatoes for dinner. Like the other reviewers I had no idea how to do the pinwheel shape so I was on my own for that...could have been the whole problem together. I will admit to having 'bread related' issues I don't bake fresh breads well and this did nothing to boost my tiny fragile ego. I will not be making this again.",
