There will never be another acorn squash peeled in this house, unless somebody can tell me how to do it more easily!  We really liked how this turned out, but in the future, I\u2019ll substitute  butternut squash (that I can peel fairly easily).  It did turn out a bit overcooked/mushy, so in the future, I\u2019ll check for doneness at 35 minutes instead of 40.  Very tasty, and once the peeling is complete, it is indeed very easy, too.",
