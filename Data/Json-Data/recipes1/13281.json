I added some lightly sauteed onions red and green bell pepper broccoli and mushrooms to the chilies to increase the vegetables and cut the amount of cheese in half because two pounds is A LOT of cheese. The chilies really gave this dish a great flavor! My husband who was skeptical at first loved this dish. This was a great new way for us to eat up all the eggs that we get from our chickens. Cut into 12 squares each serving was a protein-rich 200 calories.:-)",
