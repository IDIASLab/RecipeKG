Topped with canned fried onions and bacon bits. Cooked in a big 9 x 13 pan because we like the well done parts best. RAVES ALL AROUND!!!",

Only difference to my recipe is that I use cream of chicken soup an ordinary onion and add 1 1/2 cups of cheese to the mix. I spread the butter-cornflakes mix on top and bake it uncovered in a 9x13 inch dish at 350 for 60 min though. Some reviewers said their gratin would not be done or too greasy - by distributing the potatoes in a bigger dish they will be done for sure. Crush the cornflakes in smaller pieces with your hands and use 1 to 2 cups crushed cornflakes this way the butter gets absorbed and it makes a nice crust. Mexican fans may use tortilla chips (reduce butter though). And of course hash brown potatoes from the freezing aisle will do too!;-) Just prolong the cooking time by 10 minutes if you didn t let them thaw before preparing. However - I think this is a recipe you can not go wrong with.",
