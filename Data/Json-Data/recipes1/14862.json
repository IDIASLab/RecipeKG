But instead of getting 12.5 cookies for half a batch, I got 31 cookies!! Not only is the recipe a failure but the amount of cookies is way off.  I baked the first batch for 15 minutes and they stuck to the parchment paper. I was unable to remove them in one piece. The pieces that I was able to remove crumbled completely. The 2nd batch I baked for 18 minutes hoping that maybe if I baked them longer they would release from the parchment paper. Nope, still stuck (see pictures). On the 3rd and 4th batch I added 1 extra minute and the cookies still stuck. Needless to say I did not make the filling since I was unable to get even 1 unbroken, uncrumbled cookie.",
