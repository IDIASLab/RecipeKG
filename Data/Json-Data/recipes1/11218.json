I think the confusion may only be in the order of the recipe....it breaks down as most cakes do- mix dry mix wet and add together. Taste wise they were good...my son loved them! Next time I would not mix marshmallows into the batter but would place several into the muffin cups and add batter on top. (Haven't tried that yet so can't swear by it.) By the way store in airtight container and they get REALLY moist and gooey. That is a good thing!",
