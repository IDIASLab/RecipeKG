I didn't have any buttermilk so I used the rhubarb juice to add to the milk instead of lemon juice - probably between 1/4 and 1/2 cup of juice. I also didn't add the topping suggested as I didn't want a coffee cake. I used homemade cream cheese frosting and it was wonderful!",

The cake turned out VERY moist to the point of almost having a custard-like texture. It was thoroughly cooked and took longer than stated in the recipe. I refridgerated it and it just got better and better each day since! It is a delicious heavy moist coffee-cake.
