Thanks for posting this I will use it often! I do add 2 tsp of vanilla. I throw everything into my big Kitchenaid stand mixer and let it mix until I have a soft dough and then I press the dough into a jelly roll pan that I have put parchment paper in and sprayed w/ cooking spray. I also spray my hands and then I just press it into the pan to fit. I have used either butter or margarine and it always turns out great with either one! Sassycook",
