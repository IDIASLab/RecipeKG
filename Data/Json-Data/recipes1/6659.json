I left out the almonds due to allergies. The batter tasted slightly bland so I added 1tsp salt and that helped immensely. The recipe made exactly 24 cupcakes which baked beautifully. The flavor was nice though weak. They were not as light as a typical cake but not as dense as a pound cake or quick bread. Moist enough the first day they got dry fairly quickly after that. I might make again though I would use more zest and substitute oil for the butter to increase moisture.",
