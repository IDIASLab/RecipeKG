I also added some minced garlic, dijon mustard, and worcestershire. This is a definite keeper! ",

I would put in about 1/4 of a cup and use fresh rosemary rather than dried. Use it liberally. If you bake this rather then grill do not have marinate but I would say to cook it for 45min to an hour. Goes great with couscous!!!",
