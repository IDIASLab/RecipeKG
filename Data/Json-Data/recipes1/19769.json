I used a pie pan as a 9X13 does not fit in our camper oven. I also used probably closer to a 1/4C butter than 1/2C simply because that was what I had left to use. One of our dinner guests is a blue cheese hater and she loved them. Blue cheese isn't really a predominant flavor strange as that sounds... THANKS for a recipe we will use again jodi!",
