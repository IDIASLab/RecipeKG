I used the footnote also for the dry active yeast.\n**I've also now made the recipe as written with the Rapid Rise yeast twice and it's so easy and delicious.  Since the price is the same for dry active and rapid rise, I'm now buying the rapid rise.  I also made 2 batches last time and used one for breadsticks by pressing the dough into a small cookie sheet pan, scoring with a pizza cutter and brushing on olive oil, dried oregano and basil, garlic powder and salt and pepper. I baked them for about 20 minutes at 400\u00b0 and they were delicious!",

It usually takes between 2-2 1/2 hrs to complete a pizza.  It's always delicious, but sometimes you need pizza faster!  So I threw my hand in with this dough and it was so yummy.  Crunch on the outside, soft in the middle.  Make my own pizza sauce, put some garlic salt and parmesan cheese around the crust and VOILA!  Very good!  Will use often.",

I would say it was a hit! Next time, I'll try the garlic herb version.",

I found, however, that just the plain dough was a little too ordinary, so I spiced it up a bit and added some minced garlic, basil, and a little bit more salt when the dough was being made. After I put it in the pan and had all the toppings on it, I brushed the crust with some melted butter and sprinkled garlic powder and Parmesan cheese before putting it into the oven. Amazing.",

PERFECTION!!!! I don't even have to look up this recipe, its committed to memory- so easy and so good. If your looking for a pizza dough recipe try this one. You'll be very happy with it.",
