The first thing I did was eliminate the water and substitute Kitchen Basics Chicken Stock which elevated the flavor of the broth and lowered sodium. I would take step #1 (cooking the pasta) and move it down in the recipe otherwise you ll have cooked pasta sitting there and drying out. This recipe lists making the roux at the end and then adding the lumpy butter-flour mixture directly to all of the rest of the ingredients in the soup. I held off on adding the milk and added it to the roux making sure that it was smooth which also lets you control the soup's thickness (some folks said it was too thin). Doing it this way will give you a non-lumpy and creamy soup thickened to your preference. This recipe did take some time and has a lot of ingredients but I will say that after adjusting the seasonings we ended up with a very flavorful and tasty soup. Soup a nice salad and some fresh fruit were enjoyed today even on a hot Florida day.",
