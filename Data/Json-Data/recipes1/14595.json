If you don't just dump the seasoning in it shouldn't clump on you. Overall I'm happy with the results but I think next time I will up the seasoning to 1 1/2 or 2 packets. Oh I also left out the parmesan since I'm not serving it until next week and I don't want to take a chance on it going bad....",
