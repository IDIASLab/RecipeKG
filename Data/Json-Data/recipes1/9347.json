I was hesitant about the spinach so I only included enough to add color & texture/dimension to the dish. Other changes: Tortelini instead of rotini (be careful when stirring & slightly undercook to retain shape). Added chunks of grilled chicken marinated in a mixture of lemon-pepper olive oil lemon juice touch of balsamic minced & powdered garlic dill Included sun-dried tomatoes marinated artichokes olives Topped with toased pinenuts. I like to make pasta salads a day in advance to allow the flavors to meld. This usually means I end up needing more \"dressing.\" In this case I simply used some previously reserved marinade (described above) & it did the trick. The varying colors/textures were beautiful...next time I might consider adding diced cucumbers &/or orange or yellow peppers. Adding some yogurt might be an option for a nice creamy version...may try that next time as well. Thanks Marian for getting the ball rolling with this \"spinach version\"....it's a keeper!:)",
