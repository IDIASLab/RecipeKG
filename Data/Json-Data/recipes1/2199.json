It bakes to an almost cookie-like crunchiness on the top with a very moist and apple-y interior. I took it over the top by pouring over a caramel glaze: 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 c. brown sugar, and 1/4 c. cream. Bring to a boil, then boil 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add 1/2 tsp. vanilla. Let cool just slightly before pouring over warm cake. Hubby says the \"sauce\" was what made this extraordinarily good, but this cake is so good, so delicious, a simple sprinkling of powdered sugar would be just fine too. I don't EVER want to lose this recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing it!",

I also thinly sliced my apples and should have used 5 cups instead of 4.  I made an additional change - I beat the eggs and oil together until the eggs were a little frothy on top - about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes.  I baked this in a glass pan for 40 minutes and the cake turned out quite light and moist.  Instead of greasing and flouring the pan I substituted cinnamon sugar for the flour.\nFor those of you who haven't tried this recipe - its WONDERFUL!!!!  Not overly sweet, just bites of apple-cinnamon heaven.",

I usually don't like cake without frosting so I immediately frosted it with a cream cheese frosting. The cake beneath tastes so good (kind of has a crunchy top like crystalized sugar) that I am sure it would be good without the frosting. Anyway I did NOT make any changes to ingredients or cooking time and would not make any in the future. I greased and floured the pan per the instructions and had NO trouble with sticking. Perhaps the additional baking time is creating the sticking problem? I planned on giving small plates of this away to my neighbors but now that I've tried it it will be tempting to inhale it all myself!",

Don\u2019t change the ingredients it just takes away from the perfection, I\u2019ve tried doing variations. \n\nNow, the downside. I\u2019ve made this cake many, many times and noticed that it tends to get really moist as time goes on. Eat it FAST. The first day it\u2019s perfect; crusty sweet top and moist mellow inside. The second day it tends to get moist with a wet sticky top and heavier inside. The third day it\u2019s soggy, no other word for it. I don\u2019t know why this happens, to this extreme. But when u have people around it doesn\u2019t always last that long. The other problem I\u2019ve had is that I can\u2019t get the eggs and oil to beat until creamy.  They always end up looking like yellow liquid. I don\u2019t know what happens there, maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m using a stand mixer with a paddle? I\u2019ve tried varying the time I mix from a little to a lot; the good news is the cake still comes out of the oven tasting unbelievable. This is one recipe you have to try!!!!!!\n",
