I add extra pecans for the decorative topings and substitute a nut milk (I like almond or hazelnut) for the soy milk. I usually just use ground pumpkin pie spice instead of the spice combo listed. I have found that this pie is best when the filling is blended extra long in the food processor and stored in the fridge overnight before serving. Making it the same day seems to result in a less flavorful pie with a gloppier consistancy.",

I used pumpkin pie spice and some dried crushed ginger instead of fresh. I liked the idea of having a gingery pie but I do think a tablespoon would be too much. I used 'silk' soy creamer instead of regular soy milk and I think it greatly enhanced the recipe the pie was not runny at all. Another thing that made my pie perfectly thick was that I used half the amount of maple syrup purely because I ran out at 1/4 cup I thought I had enough! But I really think it was good that that happened. I don't have a huge sweet tooth anyways. But all in all I couldn't have made the filling any good without this. Try it with the creamer if you aren't worried about fat content it's great!",

I replaced the maple syrup with agave nectar (which is low-glycemic) and replaced the spices with 2t pumpkin pie spice. It was not very sweet though much less sweet than pumpkin pie usually is. I fixed that by eating it with ff cool whip on top. I may add 1/2c splenda to the filling next time. Also I did not have any problems with the consistency the texture turned out great.",
