Then I put them under the broiler for a few minutes to get the peanut butter crusty before lying them down in the dish to roast at 375. They're still great. First I have to say that the entire office was skeptical of these. Some wouldn't try them when I made a few dozen of them. Those who did unilaterally were pleasantly surprised at how 'not awful' the results were. This is a terrific alternative to cheese-stuffed peppers and should be tried before judged. Super Bowl Sunday seems like a good time to experiment. Also try sticking them uncovered under the broiler. I did them both ways and preferred those done under the broiler to those roasted in foil.",

I am so glad I took the chance because not only did they make a great ice breaker but they were a huge success! In fact we are making them for another (much larger) party at my husbands bosses house next weekend. One quick note about the heat. I made about 20 peppers and some were really hot some were milder. The smaller ones seems to have the most kick! So if you don't like the heat my advice is to get the bigger peppers and make sure you scoop the seeds out really well!",
