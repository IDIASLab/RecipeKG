I also added an entire package of mini marshmallows as another suggested. Simply fabulous! Make sure to drain the crushed pineapple thouroughly! This is a very tasty treat and very similar to this website's \"Antoinette's Strawberry Freeze\" (which is wonderful)! Thank you for the great post! Will be making this one again and will try it with cherry pie filling as the recipe calls for! I may even try it with blackberry pie filling! Very kid-friendly too!",

One ingredient that I have seen in other recipes for this was missing though - 1 cup miniature marshmallows.  It's a must!  The 2nd time I made this, I used fat-free sweetened condensed milk, fat-free whipped topping, and unsweetened crushed pineapple.  Wow - still awesome, and so much less fat!  Will do that from now on.  Thanks for the recipe!",
