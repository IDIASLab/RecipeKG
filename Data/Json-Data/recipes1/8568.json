This time I realized once I had my crust made and all my ingredients out (I made a quick graham cracker crust instead of using a traditional crust) that I didn't have any milk so I substituted 2 cups of water for 2 cups milk for the custard and added extra cornstarch Starting with just a little and working up to about a tablespoon extra. It doesn't appear to have affected the final consistency. With some tweaking this recipe is great. Coconut meringue is my husband's favorite and my get out of jail free card and this recipe is easier than others I've used while still tasting like it took hours to make.",
