It may have been that the pickling spices were weakened somewhat by the amount of cucumbers.I guesstimated that the recipe was using average size cucumbers. However I think that I over eye-balled it as far as cucumbers. Probably on the onions too. I appreciated the recipe however personal tastes lead me to taking some of the pickle juice and a couple of cups of sugar and creating additional sweetness to add to the pickles. Also I added a clove of fresh garlic and some red pepper flakes. I only gave thhis recipe 3 stars because the recipe needed to specify size amount etc. on the amount of cucumbers. I would like to have found an alternative way to combine the mixture for a crunchier pickle. I will probably try a number of the other recipes on her also. Overall this isn't too bad. Just not anything I would try again in a hurry. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

I didn't have 10 pickling cucumbers only about 6 so I cut back on the ingredients and only used about 4 cups of sugar. I cut the pickling cucumbers lengthwise in to quarters before soaking them in the water. When I drained the liquid I left the pickling spices mixed in with the cucumbers and onions. Like another reviewer said I put the pickles in to sterilized jars but then processed the jars for 10 minutes so I would be able to store them on my shelf. I will definitely be using this recipe again! Thanks!",
