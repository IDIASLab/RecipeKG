Other adjustments included increasing cherries to 1 1/4 c., substituting 1 1/2 t. vanilla and 1 t. almond extract in place of butternut extract. Since I wanted to display this cake I did not make the frosting. Will definately make again, although frosting would certainly be yummy it truly is not necessary. Watch cooking time, outside was tiny bit dry but everyone raved about taste, beauty and size.",
