So you really only need to flip the long end over three times and make sure edge is on the bottom.:)",

Two of my rolls cracked open a bit during baking. I'm not sure if that was because I rolled the dough out too thin or added too much filling. It didn't matter. They tasted wonderful. A little goes a long way as it is quite filling. I froze all but one loaf. Thanks for the great recipe.",

Before you use the butter melt and warm gently until the milk curds separate and then use it. A good vegetable oil works great to rub on the rolls and then chill the dough at least 4 hours this makes the dough easier to use and less yeasty. Please only use real sour cream no low fat product. Flour like gold medal will make the dough tender robin hood will make it more dry. Use egg white/some water for a golden glaze. Apply glazing when rolls are almost totally baked then put back in oven to darken. Egg/milk and eggyolk/milk glaze will make the rolls a darker color. I prefer the golden look.",

After spreading the walnut filling add a few golden raisins that have been plumped in water for 5 min. Agree with the comment about not rolling them too tight.",
