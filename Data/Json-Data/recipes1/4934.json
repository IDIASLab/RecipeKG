I could not follow it as written because I couldn't find the date bread mix - the stores were sold out due to the holiday. What I ended up using was JIFFY Bran-Date Muffin Mix. I followed the recipe for the Bran-n-date bread on the back of the box. Using 3 boxes of mix 6 eggs 6 Tbs. brown sugar 1 cup milk. I added 1 cup of chopped candied cherries 1 cup chopped dried pinepapple 1/2 cup chopped dired appricots 1 cup raisins and 1 cup chopped walnuts. I only dredged the raisins in flour -- but next time I would do all of them (the fruit sinks). I divided the dough into 3 small alluminum loaf pans and baked them for 50-55 minutes at 350. They turned out great. I would like to thry them the original way - but if I can't find the date bread I would make them again this way. It's a much lighter fruitcake than the traditional one. Much better too.....",
