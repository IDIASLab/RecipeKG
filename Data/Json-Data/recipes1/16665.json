They cook very nicely with ground beef so you don't get an overpowering pepper taste. I add the salt and pepper to the ground beef while it's cooking to enhance the flavor of the meat. Some reviewers said it tasted too ketchupy. The longer you let it simmer the more the ketchup will cook. I added about 20 minutes cooking time. I think it will be a good base recipe to customize but I do like it just the way it is and so do my teenage boys one of whom is a very picky eater.",
