I boiled 2 decent size chicken breast for approx. 30 mins. (didn't want to be too mushy) I used 1-Campbell's Cheedar Cheese soup, 1-Campbell's Cream of Chicken, and 1-Campbell's Broccoli Cheese Soup. mixed w/ milk.  Everything else I followed.  You may need to use more melted butter along with the bread crums b/c it got solid after stirring.  Next time, I'll just pour the melted butter over the cheese, then sprinkle the bread crumbs last.  Other than those small tweaks...it was very tasty!  And the hubby was very pleased--I can gauge him by asking can I add this to my recipe book?!?  He responded, definetly!  ;-)",
