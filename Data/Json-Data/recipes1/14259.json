I use tri color rotini, grape tomatoes, pepperonchinis instead of the green peppers, and some chunked red onion.  I also use a whole 16 oz. bottle Wishbone \"Robust Italian Dressing\".  I learned that if you \"dry\" (like pat them with a clean dish or paper towels to get the water off) the noodles, the dressing will really stick a lot better.  Pour 1/2 the dressing on right away, refridgerate, and pour the other 1/2 on before serving prevents it from drying out (the noodle will soak up the dressing).  Delicious, it goes great with Italian beef.  Thanks Desiree!",

I did omit the olives and used a little less tomatoes BUT I then added some chopped zucchini.  Also, I sprinkled in just a little parmesan cheese and added a little white sugar...believe it or not, the touch of white sugar takes the edge off the Italian dressing without making it sweet.  I had people who came up to me at the shower and told me that they don't normally like these types of salads but LOVED the way this was made. They couldn't believe that the secret ingrediant was the dash or two of sugar! A great summer pasta salad! Thanks Desiree!",

                "reviewBody": "This Pasta Salad recipe is so very easy to adapt to personal taste and a great recipe to start with. I never measure amounts when making this salad yet it comes out great every time. To me, the pasta is not the star of a pasta salad but a supporting player to all the rest of the  ingredients. I know many people like to use the tri-color pasta but not me. When it cooks the colors wash out and the pale pasta colors really distract from the beauty of the colorful vegetables and other ingredients. I use quite a few regular tomatoes cut in half (seeds removed) and then cut in little wedges. I use quite a bit of quartered and sliced English (seedless) cucumber (patted dry on paper towel). I do use green pepper in small one inch slices. Definitely add some finely chopped red onion for flavor and a lovely color addition. I don't add olives because I don't like them. I don't add pimento. You can change up the cheese. Last time I used a \"Cheddar-Jack\" cheese and it was great. I do use the salami and I use turkey pepperoni (so much better and less greasy than regular). My one and only \"MUST\" when making this salad is NOT to use a bottled Italian dressing. The national brand that you make yourself is 10 thousand times superior to the bottled stuff. Try it next time and I think you'll agree. Whether you make Irlandes recipe as written, or change it up to suit your own taste, you'll end up with a wonderful salad sure to please your guests. Thank ou so much Irlandes for sharing your recipe.",
