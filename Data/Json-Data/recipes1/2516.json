Then, when mixing the batter, it became a very strange texture I could only describe as gluey, with little white chunks in it.  I'm not sure if that's how it's suppose to be or not, but as I said, they taste pretty darn good.  My grand-mother loves them (she is a buttertart fanatic!) so I will definitely make these again.",
