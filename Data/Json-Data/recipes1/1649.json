I would advise changing the oven temperature to 375 degrees because even after covering the edge of the crust it still got a little overdone on 425 degrees.  I would also not cook it on the bottom rack, but the middle rack.  Finally, wait at least 1 hour before cutting to let the cornstarch do its thing or you will end up with to much juice.  FRESH BLUEBERRYS ARE THE TICKET!!! AGAIN, VERY YUMMY!!! (loved it with vanialla ice cream)!",

We found that this is a tart-sweet pie with the juices gelled just enough not to run out of the pie IF you use a lattice crust and very small fresh blueberries.\nIf you are making a solid top crust, or using cultivated \"high bush berries\", increase the cornstarch by 1 TBSP for each change.    \nThe 3/4 cup sugar can be increased to 1 cup for those who prefer a sweeter pie, but you'll need a bit more cornstarch since more sugar draws more juice out of the berries. \nI personally found the cooking time is accurate for a lattice top, but I had to lower the temp to 400 and increase the baking time to about 1 hour for a full top crust.  \nBrowning time on a crust varies widely.  Crusts with more fat, or that use butter as some/all of the fat will brown more quickly than a crust with less fat or all shortening/oil.\nBe sure to try this pie with sharp cheddar cheese.  There's a reason New Englanders eat pie for breakfast!",

As an added tip for everyone, I used, \"Basic Flaky Pie Crust\" sumitted by Stephanie. A wonderful pie crust. Everyone loved it and said it was the best Blueberry pie they had ever eaten.

I then brushed the top crust with milk, sprinkled sugar, and baked at 400F.  To keep the edges from burning, I covered them with foil and removed for the last 15 min.  The pie came out beautiful.  I couldn't help myself and had a piece after just an hour of cooling, but it was still pretty runny.  I had to let it sit an additional hour and it set perfectly.  I already had 2 slices (one at 10 am), and I can't wait to polish off the rest!",
