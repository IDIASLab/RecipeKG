Where is the water or liquid ingrediant? I mean after cooking it for 4 hours with no water? How can the meat stay tender? Not wanting to alter the recipe too much I even added a 1/2 cup of water to the soup mix. Not even 2 hours later I checked it and the soup/gravy mixture had cooked away! The meat was burned and there was no way I could ever think about adding noodles. Maybe the cooking temp is too high or too long(i cooked it as directed)? We ended up throwing the burnt meat (and what was left of the \"gravy\"...most of it had crusted to the baking dish) and cooking a pizza instead. I would not recommend nor will I make again.",

Pick a meat with a moderate amount of fat. Cook for less time if reducing the recipe. It really is wonderful and I am picky..........EDIT....... BAH! DRAT! I made this dish at a friend's house and it started burning at 3 hours ( I smelled it)... I realize now that the secret to my success was the SHALLOW PAN I was cooking in.. A 5x5x2 glass dish tightly sealed with foil. I tried a deep dutch oven and it DID NOT WORK. I hope this helps you. xxx",
