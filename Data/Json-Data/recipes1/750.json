I didn't quite have enough walnuts but that didn't seem to matter because the filling still worked fine. I did skip the confectioners sugar because we don't overly sweet cookies and there was already enough sugar in the filling. They were perfect without. I found the instructions on cutting a little confusing. I did cut them right through and bake them as a cookie and the bake time was fine they weren't dried out at all. I will definately be making these again",
