                "reviewBody": "I agree that the recipe is inartfully worded, but I think this can be a great recipe, and I like the green-pink contrast notion.  However, I would suggest saute-ing the mushrooms, onions and vegetables first, setting them aside and making the sauce in its own pan by melting the butter and slowly adding flour over low heat and then gradually adding the milk, stirring well -- this is just a simple white sauce, after all.  Then add the dill and the veggies and any other stuff listed for the sauce.  This keeps it from being a gloppy mess.\r\n\r\nI must say, though, if you really want something great use FRESH salmon.  Put a square of fresh tender oven-baked salmon (cook with minced garlic spread over the fish and a drizzle of olive oil) over the noodles, pour over a generous amount of the sauce with the veggies and stuff.  Then you just pull apart the fish to eat with the noodles, slightly stirring as you eat.  YUM!!\r\n\r\nAnother fantastic dish can be made by making a basic cream sauce (like the white sauce but use cream), no dill, no other veggies, and then add SMOKED salmon strips, rock shrimp, and RAW red onions.  Delicioso!!  This dish I had at Scomo's in San Francisco, and I was in heaven!!  My only regret was that I was staying at a hotel without a fridge and couldn't take the substantial amount of leftovers with me!!!!   SOOOOOO GOOOOOD!!!!!",

(ahem) that being said I'll tell you the changes I made to it just because I had the richer stuff available. I broiled my fresh salmon with minimal seasoning lemon-lime pepper and garlic powder olive oil. I made the roux as suggested with onions and mushrooms in pan it worked fine because there wasn't a liquid in there yet. Once the flour was toasted up pretty well I used a cup of half & half and the rest of the liquid was made up with pasta water. I added a few shakes of the lemon-lime pepper to the sauce as well. A little white wine as suggested and a handful of frozen peas as suggested by someone else and it was done. I tossed the pasta in the sauce and served the salmon on top. I saved all the garnish since it was just myself and young daughter eating and it was delish!! I will definitely make again.",
