I LOVE peanut butter and could eat it by the spoonfuls...(too bad they don't make a fabulous fat free version). Just as the submitter states it's refreshing and tasty!  I froze my banana so I only used a little ice and to lighten this up I used skim milk (a bit less than called for to get the desired consistency) along with reduced fat peanut butter.  Not only is this good, but it's good for you too and perfect for breakfast or a nice snack!",

We preferred it with vanilla almond milk, no regular milk.  It was good both ways though.  I didn't use honey with any of them, as it was plenty sweet enough. I also used organic peanut butter that was simply ground peanuts - no sweeteners or anything else added.  Plants store their food in the roots, so the peanuts have a lot of sugar already.   We started freezing almond milk in the ice cube tray and use about 5 cubes and 1/2 cup almond milk instead of the cup of milk.  Makes a delicious frosty treat that's healthy, and filling too.",
