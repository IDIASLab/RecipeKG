We received  a great price on it because the builder was bitter from a recent divorce.(He realized that she would be awarded half of the profit!) My parents got the house for a song.  Laurel made this recipe for our family when the deal was closed. I make it for baby showers, church functions, and funerals. Everyone loves this recipe! Makes 2 pans of lasagna and freezes very well.",

I used the \"no cook\" lasagna for this and I think the cottage cheese and the colby cheeses make a big difference!!!! I also substituted smoked turkey sausage for the ground pork and it was GREAT -- and cuts the fat a little!!!!! It definately freezes well and will be a \"keeper\" at our house!!!! Thank you Laurel and Holly!!!!",
