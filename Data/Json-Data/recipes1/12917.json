I forgot to add the butter and used 2 T of buttermilk powder in place of the powdered milk, which I didn't have.  I also added about a tsp. of dried minced garlic.  Rolled it into a rectangle after rising, sprinkled with cheese, rolled up jellyroll style and curled it into a spiral in a 9\" cake pan.  Brushed with olive oil after it rose and baked till done.  Big hit with the family - it came out tasting almost like a croissant and was light and flaky and moist.  I plan on trying this again but with bittersweet chocolate instead of the cheese a'la French chocolate bread.",

This Cheese Bread has a wonderful home baked flavor with splashes of mild cheddar cheese that is to die for! I make a snack out of this bread and is good served at room temperature or slightly warmed in the microwave to bring out it's wonderful flavor even more! The only difference I can see is that the Amish bake their's in the oven opposed to a bread machine and sprinkle the top of the loaf with cheddar cheese before baking.",
