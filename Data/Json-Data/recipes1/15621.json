I had presents to wrap and baking to do, so I wanted something simple but delicious, something more interesting than the plain ol' grilled cheese sandwich I almost settled for.  Hoping for a twist on that old standby, this recipe came up with a simple search for \"grilled cheese sandwich\" and what a great find it was!  The ingredients seem like such a natural, yet I never would have thought to put them together in a grilled cheese sandwich.  I really liked this - the flavors all come together and  using good, sturdy Italian bread really helps make the sandwich. This was a quick and delicious meal with ingredients I readily have on hand.  No boring grilled cheese sandwich here!",
