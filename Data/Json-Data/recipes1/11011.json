Changes I do, I use the larger can of pumpkin (30oz) and leave the rest of the amounts the same  and no problems.  I do 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.   I took this to a gathering at our local saddle club today.  We have a lot of women there that are fabulous cooks and bakers.  I've had people tell me things were good in the past.  But this time, I had them asking for the recipe, I've been messaged on facebook for the recipe and compliments and I've even had some phone calls.  I have never had that happen before.  Thanks for a great recipe!",
