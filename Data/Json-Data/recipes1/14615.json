I found that the lime was very strong after making the salad so I added another tablespoon of oil (I used grapeseed oil) to mellow it out and added about 1 tablespoon of white wine vinegar. Salt and pepper to taste. Perfect! Will be serving this with Spicy Lime-Cilantro Marinated Flank Steak from this site. Updated: THis was even better the next day. I cut up the left over steak that I served it with and mixed it into the salad and had it cold the next day and I liked it even more! Very fresh!",

Also chopped fine 1/2 of a large jalapeno (because we like it with a little kick). 5 limes doesn't really tell me how much juice - so I juiced 5 limes and it was a scant 1/2 cup. I added an extra 2 limes juiced and a 1/2 tsp. garlic salt and 1/2 tsp. cumin. Think it will be really tasty after it sits in the refrigerator for a few hours or over night.",

I used olive oil and stirred it into the pasta before adding anything else so it would be easier to mix in the other ingredients. I gave this 4 stars because it seemed a little bland. I added a couple teaspoons of spicy mexican chili powder and a little cayenne which gave it just the punch it needed. As others suggested I made it the day before so the flavors could blend better.
