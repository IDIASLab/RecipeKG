I just added one thing which is an old trick I recently learned from a New York State apple farmer who's family has been making hot cider for 150 or so years.  Thinly slice and or chop up some McIntosh apples including the peel into small pieces and drop a small bunch of the apple pieces into each cup of hot cider just before serving.  This makes a wonderful addition to this recipe, which I would say is the best hot cider I have ever tasted.  Thanks so much for posting this great recipe.  IT IS WONDERFUL!",

I took the advice of several reviewers. To cut down the sweetness I started with a \"natural\" pressed cider (read: No Sugar Added) and I used all the maple syrup called for, but I used a syrup that had less sugar in it (\"light\"). The fruit I just sliced up and let float (but removed it after about an hour), and I used ground cinnamon (1 tsp) and ground allspice (1/2 tsp). I will definitely be making this again!!",

I scaled the recipe to 1 gallon and poured it into my big crockpot a few hours before my holiday party.  Once it was hot, I added a dollop of butter (about 2-3 tbsp).  It sounds crazy, but a little butter adds a smooth richness and concentrates the flavors.  Trust me.  The hot cider was a massive hit!  I had another gallon of cider and as people dipped out of the crockpot, I topped it off with fresh cider and a little more maple syrup.  I kept a bottle of Captain Morgan's spiced rum next to the hot cider so people could make it a little more \"merry\" if they wished.  My two gallons of cider was inhaled by 14 people in less than an hour and everyone was begging for the recipe.  I made it again for Christmas Day brunch and kept it going through the day, with the same rave reviews (but a different group of drinkers).  The maple syrup and butter are key to the great flavor.  I also served Gingerbread Man shooters (equal parts Baileys, butterscotch schnapps, & cinnamon schnapps, w/ a splash of vodka) topped w/ whipped cream - a fun pairing of drinks for the holidays!",
