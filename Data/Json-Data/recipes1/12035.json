I was pleasantly surprised. My family loves this recipe. My only question is why is it suggested that the spices and sugar be put in a cheesecloth. It just melts away into the boiling tomatoes and leaves a messy cloth to clean up. My guess is that the cheesecloth catches the chunks of clove etc. Am I right?",

So after finding this recipe I thought I would try it out. I like that this recipe has a whole lot less sugar than many of the other recipes I saw online for Chow Chow.   I made this exactly as written except I added 4 tsp of turmeric.  And as another reviewer mentioned, I figured that the spices would just go through the cloth since they are ground. So I just added them to the vinegar with the sugar and the horseradish. I boiled it till the sugar was dissolved then added the tomato mixture.  It cooked for about 1 1/2 hrs before the tomatoes were tender. This made about 30- 250 ml jars.  This is the first time I have made or eaten Chow Chow, and it has been a good experience. Both my husband and I think it is delicious!  I can't wait to start trying it as a relish, in omelettes, or maybe even in a grilled cheese sandwich. Thanks for helping me make use of my green tomatoes, and for the great recipe!",
