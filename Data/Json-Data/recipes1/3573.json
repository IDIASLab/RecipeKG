I used a can each of tomato & mushroom soup to reduce the \"tomato soup-y\" taste added minced garlic to the ground beef and a healty amount of thyme and used fresh green beans. I really liked it but my husband was less than impressed. I would give it 4 stars but since hubby probably doesn't want me to make it again I have to reduce it to 3. Thanks for the post and I wish I could make it again!",
