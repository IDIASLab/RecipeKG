I added 3 cloves of garlic, added extra chili powder, added 2.5 cups of chicken broth instead of 4 cups of vegetable stock, added chopped celery (2 stalks) when I added the corn, and used 3 cans of beans instead of 2 (1.5 in the blender and 1.5 as whole beans).  I like using the Del Monte Fiesta Corn when making this recipe because the pieces of pepper add a little more spice.  All in all, a GREAT soup.  I made it for my parents and my 13-year old sister and we ate the entire pot in one sitting.  My sister is the pickiest eater ever and she loved it, so that says alot about how good it was.  Thanks so much for sharing this with us, DeeDee!",
