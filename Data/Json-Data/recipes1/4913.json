Instead I saute a 1/2 onion, diced, and the mushrooms in 1 tablespoon of Canola oil. In the same pan, I then brown 1 pound of ground beef and add 1 can of Consomme soup.  In a separate bowl, I mix 1 cup of Lite sour cream with 3 tablespoons of flour with salt and pepper to taste, then add to the meat mixture and let simmer until flavors have blended.  I've had so many compliments over the years.  It's a quick, inexpensive way to fix a delicious meal.  I call it \"Poor Man's Strogonoff\"!",

                "reviewBody": "This is almost identical to the recipe I made last night. It's the best stroganoff I ever had. It has some changes. I used 1 pound sirloin,sliced very thin(almost shaved). Dredge in flour and brown in a couple tablespoons butter. In another pan fry up onion and 8 oz. sliced mushrooms in 2 T butter until golden. When done, deglaze both pans with about 1/2cup white or red wine. I had omitted this process because I didn't have any wine and it was still awesome. Combine all into one pan. Add 2cups beef broth and add 1 cup sour cream. Simmer all for 30 min.or until meat is tender. During cooking the sour cream will separate and some of the butterfat will become visible, don't be alarmed, this is normal, just keep stirring. Season with salt and pepper and can add 1 T worchester sauce if desired. Add 1 more cup sour cream to this just before serving. Serve over cooked noodles. It is basically the same as this recipe, but a bit more pricey because of the meat and more work but so worth it. This version is from a very good chef so don't be afraid to try it. My family went crazy over this version and that is why I gave it 5***! Thanks Colleen!",

There was a nice balance between the flavours of all of the components and expecially some sweetness from the onions and great mushroom flavours. The Stroganoff was creamy and really flavoured each and every noodle. I made enough for 4 portions so that I can eat more at a later date and I am glad I did. This is the best tradtional stroganoff I have had to date. Add 1 clove minced garlic to mushroom/onion mixture for enhanced flavours. Thanks Coleen!",

I sauted the onion and hamburger together, adding a couple cloves of minced garlic, leaving out the butter.  Just as the hamburger started to brown, I added a can of sliced mushrooms and continued to cook.  Once the hamburger was brown, I deglazed the pan with some dry sherry, then, instead of adding flour, I added the beef broth, brought it to a boil and added 1 cup of minute rice and half the sour cream.  Brought it up to just boiling, covered, reduced heat and simmered 10-15 minutes until the rice was done and it started to thicken.  Right toward the end, I added the rest of the sour cream.  My husband loved it.  It will definitely be made again.",

It should still be in the instructions because sometimes you want to keep it and sometimes you don't. This is a don't time. It can come out greasy and soupy if you don't. I also recommend not cooking the noodles separate. Once you've completed the sauce just before the sour cream is added through the noodles into the dish and let them absorb the sauce. The noodles come out bland if you don't. Season very well. I added a fair amount of salt and pepper and still found it bland.",
