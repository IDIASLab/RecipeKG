I don't make faces when I drink it like some of them!  In fact I rather like the flavor.  I don't peel or de-leaf anything and I usually use 8-10 kale leaves and a bit more ginger.  I like that my husband and I are consuming 2 to 3 x as much fresh fruits and veggies with just 8 oz of this per day.  My skin has improved, I am less hungry duirng the day, and even at the end of a long day I am still going strong.  I didn't expect that at all... just wanted to eat healthier and use the juicer that has been sitting for far too long.",

In case you're curious about calorie counts (forgive me I have not read every review) here they are: Kale/cup - 40 Celery/stalk - 5 Cucumber 8\" - 15 Apple medium - 60 Lemon - 15 Ginger Root - 9 I'm guessing by the recipe listed the entire double serving weighs in at 259.5 calories or 129.75 per serving. I only use one apple and usually an entire lemon. Just my taste. I've also found that about a quarter tsp of horseradish adds a little bite to it. I've also added fresh jalepeno. Both mods are pretty good. Thanks a million for the recipe!",
