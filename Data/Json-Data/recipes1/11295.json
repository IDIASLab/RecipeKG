After reading the many reviews, I decided to make a few adjustments that sounded good to me also, like the addition of shrimp, a few different vegies, and pineapple.  Had the meat marinating for about 6 hours, the vegies only about 3, but made the terrible mistake of putting the fresh pineapple in with the meat.  DO NOT DO THIS.  There was some sort of a reaction, and it must have started 'cooking' the meat while it marinated....the meat was terrible, we had to literally throw it out.  It was mushy and mealy, changed the texture entirely.  The pineapple and vegies, however, were delicious, and gone in a flash.  Luckily we had hotdogs and hamburgers to have with them.....Operator error on this one, will definitely try this again, with no pineapple in the bag while marinating!!  Do try it!",

One suggestion is to not to place meat and vegetables on the same skewer; although it looks pretty, they have different cooking times.",

I never marinate meat together with veggies and always grill them separately as they cook at different rates.  Overall, very tasty.",
