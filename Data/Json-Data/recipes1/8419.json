I made it even easier by doing step 3 in the microwave instead of a double boiler--just combine the chocolate and cream and heat at 1-minute intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate is melted. Also, I made this for Thanksgiving and my mom doesn't like to eat a lot of sugar, so I used unsweetened chocolate (good quality, of course, is key) and Splenda (probably about 1/3 C). It turned out great. Oh, and also I used a regular pastry pie crust instead of the cookie crust. I think it was definitely the way to go. The filling is so rich, I think the cookie crust would have been too much. I think this recipe will become a new holiday tradition. Thanks!!",

Add it to the chocolate while melting (I used about a teaspoon)...it adds a little depth of flavor that is amazing to an already great recipe! I also HIGHLY suggest using chocolate in bar form (such as Ghiradelli), because it melts much better than chips. Not only does bar chocolate have more cocoa butter, causing it to melt better, but chips have additives that are there to help them hold their shape by raising their melting temperature (why they are perfect for chocolate chip cookies), making them not the best tasting chocolate for melting either- partly because of the additives and partly because chocolate flavonoids are highly volatile and the less heat chocolate is subjected to the better it will taste.",

I put the mousse on top, chilled them then put a little whipped topping and a pinch of dark chocolate shavings on top. It was a huge hit and they looked beautiful.
