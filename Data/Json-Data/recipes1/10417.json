I used thick chops in a double dose of Herb-Ox and added a squirt of prepared mustard. It was delicious and not dry at all.",

Then I rolled the chops in flour and browned both sides of the meat in the oiled skillet. While the chops were browning I combined the dry mustard with a package of onion soup mix and a 14.5 ounce can of chicken broth (not soup). The chops were tender and perfectly seasoned. Just before serving I removed the pork chops and added a bit of cornstarch the thicken the sauce to create rich gravy. I served this with white rice and green beans and received a thumbs up from everyone at the dinner table. Thank you for sharing.",
