My family and friends can never stop eating these cookies. I always make them for holiday gatherings. A single batch makes a lot, but I usually double it up and make larger cookies. If  you are looking for something comparable to store bought sugar cookies, this is it. I forgot to add that I omit the salt. I don't like salt in any cookies that I make...",
