For safety reasons heating the unopened can (an old cooking method) is NOT recommended. Instead use one of the following methods. OVEN METHOD; Pour 1 can Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk into 9 inch pie plate. Cover with aluminum foil; place in larger shallow pan. Fill larger pan with hot water. Bake at 425\u00ba for 1 1/2 hours or until thick and caramel colored. STOVETOP METHOD; Pour 1 can Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk into top of double boiler; place over boiling water. Over low heat simmer 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until thick and caramel colored. Beat until smooth. MICROWAVE METHOD; Pour 1 can Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk into 2-quart glass measuring cup. Cook on 50% power (medium) 4 minutes stirring briskly every 2 minutes until smooth. Cook on 30% power (medium-low) 20 to 26 minutes or until very thick and caramel-colored stirring briskly every 4 minutes during the first 16 minutes and every 2 minutes the last 4 to 10 minutes. CAUTION: NEVER HEAT UNOPENED CAN. my mom used to make this and after it cooled in the can she sliced it thinly and put between two rings of canned pineapple and whipped cream on top...delicious! They seriously advise against heating the unopened cans these days because of safety concerns.",

We cut the recipe in fourths and used just one can of sweetened condensed milk and had more than enough to generously fill 30 little (2\" diam.) phyllo dough pastry cups. It's really exciting to see what's in the can after it has cooled! The flavor from the chopped up cherries is so slight (I think you could use cherry juice.) but really complements the almonds' flavor. Enjoy!!",
