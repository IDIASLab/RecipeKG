I had to use an orange bell pepper as that is all I had on hand. I had a package of cooked pulled pork in the freezer that I used in place of the bulk sausage and it worked great. I also had a bag of cooked medium shell pasta that I was wanting to use up so that was in place of the egg noodles. This mixed together very well and the house smell great while it was baking. If I make this again I'm going to up the spices and use fresh garlic in place of the garlic powder. The flavor was very mild and DH spiced his up with Tabasco. The casserole was served with 'Cranberry Salad' and 'School Lunchroom Cafeteria Rolls' both from AR.",
