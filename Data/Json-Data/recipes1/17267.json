To the meat/cream cheese (I also used whipped cream cheese w/chives) I added about a half of pkg. of frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed free of water. 1 can of rotel tomatoes, Italian seasoning, salt, garlic pepper, celery seed. Also added a handful of shredded coby/jack cheese. Mix well and add to pre-baked crescent pan. After adding the mix to the pan, I topped with more co/jack cheese, and covered with the remaining dough.  Before baking in oven for about 20-30 minutes, I spread the dough with butter and added a sprinkling of parmesan cheese.  Turned out great...",

I let the bottom crust cook for 8 minutes. Then I filled it and topped with the second sheet and let it cook for 15 minutes.  Definitely better using the higher temperature.  Also, much better using hot sausage.      3-8-2012 Easy and very filling. I cooked the bottom crust for at least 10 minutes, and I ended up adding a lot of time to the second cooking as well. I wonder if the oven temp should be raised to at least 375 degrees.",
