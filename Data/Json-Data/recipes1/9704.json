I lined a terrine mold with plastic wrap (one sheet of cling wrap draped over the three longest sides and then smoothed down) so the terrine came easily out of the mold - just try & keep the plastic smooth so you don't get huge creases in your terrine! Overall this was tasty but the texture of mine was super smooth. I think next time I'd try blending it a little less or adding finely diced green onions after the processing step to create a little texture.",
