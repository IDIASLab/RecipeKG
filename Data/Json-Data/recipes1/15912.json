I do think the next time I fix this I will use the frozen chicken breasts that you buy in a bag because I think they are easier to pound a little flatter.....I think it would be even better then. The calorie count shown here is not the same as on another recipe site however. That one shows 410 per serving..... which makes more sense considering the fattening ingredients. P.S. You need to let the chicken stand at least 10 minutes in the covered skillet to let the cheese melt and soak in the sauce.",

To thicken the sauce we use milk instead of water.  Sometimes we add some karo syrup for sweetness but then add a tsp of vinegar to contrast.  My husband is the one who doctors this recipe & does it by taste.  We serve over angel hair pasta.  Such a light refreshing taste compared to the rest of our recipes.",
