                "reviewBody": "We made these as Easter treats for family and friends! People wow over them. You can use plain crispy cereal and turn them any color you want (pink blue purple etc.) by adding a few drops of food coloring to the marshmallow mixture before mixing in the cereal - use white chocolate or skip the chocolate all together. You can also make your own frosting using confectioner's (just use the recipe on the box) and add a couple drops of food coloring to tint it any color you like! You can also tint store-bought white icing. Try decorating the bunny with a pink body and a white tummy - super cute! If you don't have an icing piper here's a tip: spoon icing into a ziplock bag snip the corner off one edge of the bag (the bigger the cut the larger the line of icing you will make) and squeeze the frosting in the desired design. Also if you don't have round cookie cutters the mouth of a cup works just as well - just turn the cup over and press it down to cut out a circle. I used a few drops of green food coloring and tossed it with flaked coconut to make grass which I sprinkled around the bunnies along with assorted gummy candies and jelly beans for extra character. Any small pink or red candies make sweet little noses on the bunnies. Be creative have fun! This is a great project to do with kids! Happy Easter and God bless!",
