In fact the store I went to didn't have any sherbet so I used mango sorbet and strawberry sorbet from Haggendasz. I put the bananas in the mango sorbet and the raspberries in the strawberry sorbet and then I layered the two in juice glasses and refroze them. I took them to my parents' for mothers day and set them out while we ate lunch. Then I upturned them on plates and they made cute little layered cylinders. My mom loved them and my dad was happy that he could eat them since he can't have gluten. A quick and impressive dessert! Thanks!",
