I ended up with a spread that had too much juice and then had to drain it. Nothing fancy here just a nice simple cheese spread that you can put together in minutes. You get a good balance of sweetness from the pineapple and savory from the chopped onion.",

I started to drain the pineapple as suggested by the other two reviews but I bought Dole & there wasn't much to drain. I just mixed it in with the cream cheese then added the cheese; then green onion & 1/8t cayenne. 'Thinking sour cream or half sour half cream cheese would be better. It's heavy & on the bland side. Maybe subbing & less is the key. 'Glad I tried it but it barely got touched.",
