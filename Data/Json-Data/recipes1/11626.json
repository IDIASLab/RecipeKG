I also modified the recipe to include 1 tsp. of sea salt, 1 tsp. of fresh ground pepper and 3 cloves of crushed garlic (mashed in with the potato). Delicious!",

As it does not specify the type of potato nor size I had to guess at what type to use. Because of this the amount of flour was variable as well. I ended up using a starchy (russet) medium sized potato (about the size of a cricket ball) and it worked out fine for the amount of flour suggested. The second concern I have is that there were no seasonings suggested. Without something they tasted quite bland. Salt at the very minimum should have been suggested as well.",
