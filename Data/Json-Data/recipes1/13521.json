I add the onions and green peppers to the meat while it is simmering, together with an 8-ounce can of La Costena home style Mexican hot sauce for extra zest.  I always double the quantities for the sauce, too, because the tortillas soak up so much - and the flavor is so great, it's good to have extra.  Try keeping some extra shredded beef in the sauce in the freezer for last-minute dinners.  What a time-saver!",

I also added 1 can Rotel cilantro/lime tomatoes and a couple of smoked Chipotle chilies to braising ingredients. Once tender, shredded and then chopped coarsely. I didn't bother w/separate grn chili/sour crm/cheese sauce as I don't care for s.cream in the filling. Instead, I put the prepared beef in a bowl adding the grn chilies along with some of the cooking juice. At this point I store in fridge until next day. When I was ready to assemble I veered off from this recipe and finished up in my own style. I really like the shredded beef even if I added a couple ingredients. By cooking the meat a day ahead, I find making any style enchiladas that much easier.",

I had higher hopes for this than was delivered. First of all, after reading through the recipe I knew this would be dry without some kind of sauce, so I poured green enchilada sauce over them before topping with the cheese and baking. It helped somewhat, but this was still a mediocre dish, tasting more of the corn tortillas than anything else. (I've now determined that flour tortillas are definitely better than corn tortillas!) One reviewer said it best when she said these were \"edible and forgettable,\"  and another who remarked that the meat was great...just not in these enchiladas. ",

I didn't find them to be that time consuming but I started with having some shredded beef and looking for a way to cook it so I didn't spend time on that. Next time I'll start from the beginning because my meat was not prepared according to the recipe and it sounds really good! I changed a fewv things. I used non-fat flour tortillas as that's all I had. I didn't use oil but I made some enchilada sauce from this site called 10 minute enchilada sauce. Instead of the oil I poured some sauce in the pan and covered both sides of the tortilla with the sauce. Then I followed the recipe with the cheese sauce and the meat. I only had low fat sour cream and it was fine. Also I didn't have any onions so they were left out. Anyway I poured the left over sauce on top and covered it with cheese. I'm not sure how much and it wasn't the kind called for in the recipe. It was a combination of grated mexican cheese mozarella and some irish cheese. (Can you tell I was cleaning out the fridge?) Anyway it was absoultely great!!!!! Next time I'll shop for the recipe and do it right. Edited to add: I made this again. I put all the ingredients for the beef in a crockpot for 8 hours on low. The flavor of the meat is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I found myself eating the meat as I rolled the enchiladas and there is none left over! YUM! One more thing I ran out of cheese sauce before I ran out of meat so I would double the cheese sauce.",

I left out the water and mixed the beef broth, vinegar and spices in my crockpot and then added the beef.  I let that cook on HIGH for about 8 hours.  I chopped up 1 large white onion, 4 garlic cloves and a red bell pepper and sauteed it in a large pot until soft and then transfered the meat from the crockpot.  I added a 4 oz can of chopped green chilies and turned the heat on med-hi and let most of the liquid boil off and ended up with the most tender and flavorful shredded beef I've ever made.  I did have to add quite a bit of salt to achieve the right taste (we love salt).  I skipped the sour cream and rather than making enchiladas, I let everyone assemble burritos with flour tortillas.  I made my own pico de gallo to go along with this and grated some fresh pepper-jack cheese.  I will definitley use this again and plan on passing this recipe along to others.  Thanks a million!!!",
