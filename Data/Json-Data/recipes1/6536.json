She really loves these biscuits, and I feel good knowing what goes into them.  I just made my second batch, and used beef broth instead of water and added a little crushed garlic for flea control.  Will experiment with using bacon grease for part or all of the oil next time.  i also agree that the 2 Tablespoons of vanilla may be excessive, i cut that to 2 teaspoons.  This does make a lot, and since Merry is a small dog, I cut the recipe in half.  Still made 75 small biscuits.",
