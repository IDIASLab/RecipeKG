I tried these out the other weekend at a pool party. They were really good and everyone enjoyed them. So of course we played around with the second batch a tad and turned them into what we ended up calling a Rocky Rita! Anyway you look at it recipe as given or altered to fit the fun thanks for sharing they were great and enjoyed by all!",
