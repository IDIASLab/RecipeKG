I decided to use paste, and it seemed to work. I pounded the breasts thin to ensure even cooking, and I used Italian herb-flavored chicken broth as well as Italian seasoned bread crumbs. The sauce was just enough for two breasts, so I agree with the other reviewers that you would need to increase all of the sauce ingredients if you were serving this for more than two. With all of that nitpickiness out of the way, I must say that this recipe is very good. The breasts were moist, the flavor was satisfying. It is going into my regular repertoire.",

So this gets 5 stars for not only tasting great, but bringing back memories!  I used bone in chicken breasts, and used zucchini instead of mushrooms for my husbands tastes.  I also didn't remove the chicken to let the sauce thicken, I just let it all cook together for about 40 minutes covered on medium low, and served the sauce over the chicken and rice.  A delicious and easy meal!  Thanks!",
