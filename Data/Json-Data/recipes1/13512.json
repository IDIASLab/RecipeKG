I needed a low fat dessert for a party and thought this sounded good, but I was worried about all of the comments regarding a soggy cake.  For my first layer, I used a box of sugar free fudge pudding mixed with 1.75 cups of milk and 4oz. of lite cool whip.  For my second layer, I used a box of sugar free cheesecake pudding mixed with 1.75 cups of milk and 4oz. of lite cool whip.  Oh, and I used two candy bars.  I will make this again and a again b/c it is so light - will make a perfect summer dessert.  Everyone LOVED this \"cake\" - even non-dieters loved it.",
