The key is to make sure sausage and cheese at at room temp when you start mixing and that everything is mixed well.  There should be no traces of the biscuit mix left when you start to form the balls.  The only way to get it mixed correctly is to use your hands.  I always have a couple dozen of these in my freezer ready to go.",
