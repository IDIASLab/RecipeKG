Where I live I can not obtain beau monde seasoning, so I used thyme instead, per another reviewer's suggestion.\n\nI cubed last night's roast, along with the left-over carrots, onions and potatoes from the pot. I made a nice amount of home made gravy, which is so superior to store-bought and so easy as well. Mixed all and covered with the batter for a home made biscuit mix (can be found easily on-line or on this site). Lovely, and fills a huge casserole..Quite a comfort dish and great served with green beans and a jello salad.",

An excellent chilly night/comfort food dinner that stuck to my family's ribs!",

I used leftover roast and gravy and added in addition to the carrots and potatoes a clove of garlic 1 cup sliced mushrooms 1/2 cup diced celery and 1/2 cup frozen peas along with a teaspoon of worchestershire sauce. Didn't have jarred beef gravy so added a packet of dry gravy mix to the gravy I had leftover. Omitted the Beau Monde seasoning because I didn't have any. Only problem I had was that by the time I added all the extra veggies I had enough to serve about 10 so doubled the topping. We have lots of leftovers but it was delicious and really very easy! A great way to use up the leftover roast. My husband called it beef stew with a crust! Will definitely make again!",

Instead of placing the mixture in a pie crust I served this in individual French onion soup crocks and topped with a Bisquik crust. Twenty minutes in the oven and we were good to go.
