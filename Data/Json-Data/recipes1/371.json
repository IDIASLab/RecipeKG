This was easy and unbelievably tasty! Made a few mods: I hand mixed in the flour and chips/cherries I didn't do the final 5 minute flip/bake and I made 7 dozen of them with cranberries (dried) and pecans (chopped) instead of the chocolate/cherry mixture. Also instead of using the white chocolate I drizzled vanilla almond bark (half dyed red half dyed green) over the cooled cookies. They're so pretty! Packaged in cellophane holiday gift bags (after wrapping cookies in waxed paper) and tied with a bow. Can't say it enough how much I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this recipe! Thanks so much for sharing! My gift recipients will thank you too!!",

                "reviewBody": "I would give these a 10 if I could. There were absolutely amazing. They were a nice compromise between the \"orginial\" biscotti (which had no fat other than eggs) and the buttery, cookie-like biscotti that most recipes produce. The biscotti cut well without crumbling (which was a problem with many other recipes), they puffed up perfectly, and they store nicely as well--everything you could want in a biscotti recipe! I made a few small changes: I halved the recipe, and cut back the butter by 1 tablespoon (so in the original, I would have used about 1/3 instead of 1/2 cup). I also added about 1/4 cup of toasted, flaked coconut, and I used cashews (out of almonds) instead. At the end, I melted 1/2 cup of white chocolate with a dab of butter and dipped the cooled biscotti in it.\r\n\r\nA few notes for anyone trying this recipe: I found that it might be helpful to drop the oven temperature to 250-300 after the first baking, since the outside of my biscotti was browning a little faster than it was crisping. Also, I did not grease my pan after the first baking (as suggested in the recipe), and though I had no problems with my non-stick pan, the biscotti on my other baking pan did stick a little bit. Overall, this is a great recipe, and one that I would use over and over again in the future.",

If your out buying ingredients by those listed you wouldn't have the white choc to melt!

I know a lot of people have complained about not being able to \"drizzle\" the white chocolate as it never seems to get thin enough in the microwave. I used white chocolate chips and put them in the microwave for about 30 seconds on 50% power...stirred...then did another 20 seconds. The chocolate was actually warm not too hot to handle. So at that point I spooned the melted chocolate into a small ziploc bag and snipped off a very small cut from the corner. I was then easily able to squeeze and pipe the chocolate onto the biscotti. Made it so easy! You can see the result from the photo I just uploaded.",

For those of you that said your biscotti crumbled make sure you cut while they are still warm (7-10 minutes after taking out of oven). The key is also using a good quality serrated (bread) knife to cut. If you do this and follow the recipe directions your biscotti should not crumble. I agree with others that commented you don't need to cook that long after you flip. You just need to dry them out a little more. You can even turn down the heat in the oven. Great recipe!

Nevertheless they look lovely and people love receiving them as a gift. They are softer than other recipes because of their butter. If you prefer a firmer crispier biscotti for dunking look for recipes where egg is the only fat in the ingredients list. As for candied cherries those are the little syrupy cherries that are sold in small round tubs. They're usually with the seasonal baking stuff--you would find them wherever you find those tubs of chopped fruit that people use in fruitcakes. The only difference is that the fruitcake mix is multicolored and includes pineapple and candied citrus peel (which I never liked as a kid). But basically it's the same thing. You could probably get away with using marachino cherries but the candied cherries are \"waxier\" and have less moisture. However they are brighter and moister than dried cherries/cranberries. The chocolate and cherries make this recipes pricey to pull off--but like I said it looks great.",
