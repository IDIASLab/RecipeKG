I made it though because I hadn't had them since I was a kid and my kids have never tried them. This recipe was rated so highly I thought it would be worth trying. IT WAS SO GOOD! I added a smoked sausage to it cut into coins and made corn muffins and had it as a main dish. It was so good. Thank you for this delicious recipe.",
