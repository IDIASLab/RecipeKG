I've changed it a bit each time, after reading all the reviews, and I think I've finally settled on my favorite: I use oats, sliced almonds and sunflower seeds (but no other nuts), whole flax seed, wheat germ (about 1/2 cup each)for added nutrition, plus coconut for sweetness. I up the oil and honey just a bit, plus add a bit of real maple syrup for flavor. I add a combo of regular and golden raisins, but only at the very end (otherwise they burn-yuck!). I bake it on parchment, on a lower temp (about 225) and stir often, every 7-10 minutes. I pulled it off to another pan to cool - trust me, this is a must! And then finally, since we like ours clumpy, as it was cooling, I pulled off bits and squeezed hunks together. I then mixed about half the still warm granola with about 1/3 cup powdered milk. It gave amazing flavor and texture to the finished product. This recipe is PHENOMENALLY good - and versatile and cheap. Wow, what's not to love?",

I used about 3/4 of a cup of applesauce and just a splash of olive oil in place of the canola oil. I also increased the honey to 1 cup. I added probably 1/3 cup of crunchy peanut butter to the  \"oil\" mix and added orange flavored crasins to soak while I mixed the dry ingredients. I think the only thing I added to the dry part was about 1/3 cup brown sugar.  I baked it all at 275 for about 25 minutes. I took it out and stirred it every 7 minutes and then reset the timer for another 7 minutes when I was done, and I did that 3 times total plus I left it in for about 4 minutes at the end. I dumped both pans onto paper towels to cool before I stored it, and neither my husband or I could keep from grabbing handfuls of it while it sat there. YUM!",
