                "reviewBody": "Excellent recipe!!! The first one I attempted was a lemon cake. When I poured it into the bundt pan I saw that the batter was too much to fill the pan so I filled it to where I thought was enough then I put the rest of the batter in a cupcake pan which made 11 cupcakes. The cupcakes were done in half an hour the cake was done in 45 minutes and it still seemed to be overdone by the appearance and texture of the crust but it was AWESOME when I tasted it!! I think I doubled the lemon extract to 2TB and it had a very good lemon taste. The cake still rose a lot and almost ran over the edges of the bundt pan but managed to be contained. The second time I attempted the recipe I just made it into a vanilla cake instead of lemon and ended up adding maybe 3TB of vanilla to make sure it tasted like a vanilla cake and not just a \"yellow\" pound cake. Again the batter was too much for one bundt pan so this time I put some into a metal loaf pan. (Maybe I should have used regular pound cake pan??) The cake turned out so good and moist and my in-laws loved it and kept sneaking slices throughout the day!!! My MIL even said my recipe blew away her mother's pound cake recipe because it was dense yet soft and so very moist. The crust comes out a golden brown and is ever so lightly \"crunchy.\" Even though the cake takes forever to mix (and I used a stand mixer and took probably 30 minutes mixing it) it's worth the time. Your family and guests won't be disappointed!",

I didn't have shortening and neither lemon extract anyway I went ahead and made this cake using 1 1/2 cup of butter and added 1/2 tsp. of baking power. I had people coming over for dinner and that was dessert. They ate it even when it was still warm. They loved it. I had baked this cake several times with the same great results and keep giving away the recipe. Thanks Barbara!",

I added roasted pecans to the batter and topped the cake with caramel sauce and and icing sugar mixed with milk and a drop of pure vanilla extract drizzled all over the top and sides of cake and put the remaining roasted pecans on top of that. Superb with a good cup of coffee. Use pure vanilla extract in the batter that's what gives it the flavour and you don't need much. Artificial vanilla just doesn't cut it.",
