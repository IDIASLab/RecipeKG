A couple of suggestions: (1) Add 1 teaspoon of salt to the mixture at the beginning - it cuts down on the sweetness; (2) When the mixture comes to a boil reduce the heat one notch from medium and stir occasionally - I've had no problem with a burned taste; (3) As others have said buy a good candy thermometer - I purchased a digital candy thermometer from Williams Sonoma and love it; (4) Use a silicon spoon to stir the mixture - it wont stick to the spoon; (5) Put the jelly roll pan covered with aluminum foil or Release on one side of the stove and turn on the buners to medium low. When the mixture is poured onto the hot pan the pan stays hot and the mixture is easy to spread. Use the back of a large spoon sprayed with Pam to spread the mixture; (6)I've tried the almonds per the recipe toasted walnuts unsalted roasted peanuts and toasted pecans. My favorite is the toasted pecans. I use 1 1/2 cups of toasted pecans in the mixture and sprinkle 1/2 cup toasted pecans on the top; (7) I've used milk chocolate a mixture of milk chocolate with peanut butter chips (when I used the peanuts) semisweet chocolate and bittersweet chocolate. They all work well. It's a matter of taste.",

I double the recipe (but just use 1 regular-size bag of milk chocolate) and use the bottom of a broiler pan. Don't accidentally use semi-sweet! I prefer sliced almonds and crush a few over the chocolate before it hardens to make it prettier. BIG tip: I've ruined a few pans over the years making this. I'm not a chemist but the candy still tastes great and my pans are not scorched if I stir it constantly even after it boils. In fact when I have NOT stirred it it tastes burned. It's inconvenient to stand there stirring but worth it to me. I also HIGHLY suggest getting a good thermometer! This year I made it on a cold day and set the pans out on the screened-in porch so didn't have to mess with rotating through refrigerators! Yum Yum!",

One thing I would recommend is to extend the foil over at least two ends of the jelly roll pan before you pour in the crunch because when you tilt the pan to spread it around the foil just kind of moves with it. This is going to be my holiday gift for the neighbors this year.",

The only thing I would change about the original recipe is to stir the mixture frequently after it boils. The first time I made it I did not stir it after it began to boil...but it burned (my husband still ate the entire batch). I halved the amount of chocolate chips on top and the amount of chocolate was fine. I agree with another reviewer who suggested to put sliced almonds on top of the chocolate (and press down lightly with a spatula so they stick better). It made the presentation much prettier.
