It's your typical thanksgiving turkey, only thrice as nice!  Actually, nicer still b/c with the birds all boned, the potentially destructive art of carving is removed:  you slice straight through the layers of poultry and stuffing. It's like rouladen or a yule log. The ONLY downside: the price. We got ours at WholeFoods, and the pricetag really put the po' in poultry three ways. Leftovers for days, though. I would NOT drink red burgundy or Oregon Pinot Noir with this again. It was better with a bolder wine: Exceptional with a Spanish Ribera del Duero. ",
