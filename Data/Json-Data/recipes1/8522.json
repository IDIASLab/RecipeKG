I used Morningstar Recipe Crumbles rather than whole patties and slivered almonds instead of walnuts because that was what I had on hand. I also substituted sweet and sour sauce for both the chili sauce and the Russian dressing called for and used slightly less cream cheese and round crackers than the quantities given. Finally I used Honey Bunches of Oats instead of regular cornflakes. The mixture didn't hold together well enough to be shaped into meatballs so I ended up plopping them in the baking pan like cookies but they tasted great. My brother said they didn't taste anything like regular meatballs but he ate them anyway and my mother loved the sauce. Thanks for the recipe; I will probably make it again and try it with more of the original ingredients next time.",
