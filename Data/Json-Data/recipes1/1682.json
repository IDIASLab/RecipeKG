It may not seem like such a big deal to omit the salt, but it makes a big difference in the flavor. It will enhance it, and cut some of the sweetness out, so you can enjoy the other flavors. I would probably put about half a teaspoon in it. It will make a great difference in the cookie, I promise.",
