Also increased heavy cream to 2 cups.  Folded 1 1/2 bars (6 oz.) of shaved Ghirardelli white chocolate to the combined cream mixture as a last step in that process.\n \nOmitted the cocoa dusting.\n\nFresh,homemade poundcake works best and is worth the time.  Used 1 1/2 loaves.\n\nFor raspberries, thawed and crushed (with juice) 1 1/2 10 oz. packages and mixed with approximately 1 cup of raspberry liqueur (Razzmataz).  Used this mixture to generously cover each pound cake layer.  It was more like a cold compote, but delicious.  \n\nUsed 1 pint of fresh raspberries (3 total) for each of the berry layers, saving about a dozen to garnish the top.",

I couldn't wait to write a review!  WOW!! We both loved it and it hasn't even set yet for the 4 hours in the refridgerator as suggested! \n\n A couple of things I did:  I used 3, 8oz pkgs of cream cheese as others suggested and increased the sugar and other ingredients accordingly. I also used 2 cups heavy cream as other suggested. I used regular pound cake from the store and drizzled grand marnier over the slices. Instead of using cocoa, I used dark chocolate chunks sold in the baker's isle.  For the raspberries, I used 2, 12 oz frozen packages.  As they were thawing, I added about 1/4 cup of water so I would have more syrup to pour over the cake slices, and sprinkled the raspberries with sugar. On the top, I garnished with a couple of raspberries and dark chocolate chunks and then did sift just a little bit of cocoa on the top layer only.  YUMMY! And it looks fabulous in the trifle dish.  If the others at the party like it half as much as we did, it will be a huge hit.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!",
