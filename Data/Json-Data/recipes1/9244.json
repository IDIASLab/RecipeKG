I substituted cream cheese for half of the sour cream, used a packet of taco seasoning in the beef, and another packet in the sour cream / cream cheese mixture.  A half cup or so of canned sliced jalapenos as layer #8 makes this a lot better.  If you like guacamole, use about twice as much, because the recommended amount isn't enough to even spread out to make a whole layer.  You wouldn't notice if you left it out.  I'll make this one again; it's very good.",

First of all, this recipe is fine as written and served, but our crowd typically likes a little more flavor and kick.  Differences that I would suggest is to brown your beef with a packet of taco seasoning (no water), 1.5 tbs of cumin, 1 tsp of chili powder 1 tsp of garlic and 2 tbs of dried minced onion.  Added finely chopped cilantro with the black olives, tomatoes and green onions.  Mixture of pepperjack and cheddar cheese gave the dip more complexity than straight cheddar!  Superb flavor!!!",

                "reviewBody": "I recently had a party with some people who enjoy good Mexican food...and they DEVOURED this!  The key that made this 7-layer dip so successful is the LACK of taco seasoning in the refried beans.  I've used that in the past, called for in other recipes, and it's just not good to me.  I asked my sisters about it, and they've said they just leave it out because there's a strange after-taste.  We grew up near the border and had alot of great Tex-Mex, and this recipe SHINES above any other I've tried. I prefer not to use canned refried beans, rather to go to one of the local Mexican restaurants and get a pint of their beans--they're just better if you want to WOW your guests...something different about the texture. Texans close to a Pancho's know what I mean. If you don't have time to make your own guacamole, Walmart sells a good one put out by AvoClassic, plain or spicy in a box with two 8 ounce packages that you can mash a little more, or not. I took a Mexican cooking class while a student in Mexico, but many of these recipes are just as good...including this one.",

I used homemade guacamole from another recipe on this site replaced the salsa with taco sauce (we don t like chunks of veggies) omitted the black olives and chopped tomatoes and I added a can of seasoned black beans for more texture. This dip is excellent served hot if you don't like the thought of eating cold food right out of the can you can assemble the dip minus the sour cream and guacamole and pop it in the oven at 400 degrees for about ten minutes then top individual servings with sour cream and guacamole. Delicious! I served mine up with guacamole flavored Doritos it was a hit! I m making it again this weekend!",

I used the same amount of sour cream though and instead of using guacamole I mashed 2 advocados with 1 tbsp lime juice. Also I added half a package of taco seasoning to the ground beef and mixed the other half of the package with the sour cream. My only complaint is that because this dip is so heavy the nacho chips kept breaking when they were dipped in (and we even used the scoops ones) so it might be a good idea to keep a spoon handy.
