Definitely double cocoa in cake, also add a tsp or two of instant espresso (or coffee) to buttermilk. Add 2 or 3 squares of melted chocolate to frosting depending on your tastes (mmm...heaven). Process nuts and coconut until they're finely ground before adding to batter. Do not add pecans to frosting, rather press finely chopped pecans into the sides of frosted cake - looks bakery-quality and adds great texture. Decoratively pipe leftover frosting on top of cake and garnish with chocolate-covered expresso beans. This is a dessert to die for!!!",

What a wonderful variation. I really like how mild the chocolate flavor is...some reviewers said they added more but I wouldn't change a thing. I also followed the hint about topping it off with almonds...such a beautiful presentation I took a picture of it. I made this cake for my hubby's birthday and he couldn't get enough.

Anyway, I made it a second time with modifications: doubled the cocoa, dissolved a couple of teaspoons of instant coffee in the buttermilk before adding, and also melted three square of unsweetened baking chocolate to add to the frosting.  Then it was perfect for my taste.  The frosting amount is generous, and it makes a very lovely three-layer cake.",
