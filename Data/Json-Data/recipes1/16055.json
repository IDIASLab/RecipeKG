I was disappointed in the lack of spice in the sauce (used Classico's brand) and should have added some crushed red pepper as it simmered. Could also have benefitted from some Italian seasonings with the browning chicken. Without the fresh basil it would have been a dud for me but it was definitely a well-balanced easy and inexpensive dinner.",
