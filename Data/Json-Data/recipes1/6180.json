I read over a couple of reviews that mentioned the meat didn't come out very tender so I added about 3 Tbls of lemon juice to act as a tenderizer.  I also added about 2 tsp of worchestershire sauce..(we call it rooster sauce), 2 tsp of fish sauce, 1 tsp of ground ginger, chili sauce instead of ketchup and a tsp of garlic powder.  I broiled this instead of grilling (due to the nasty weather) and it turned out really good.  My husband had 2 large peices and my 16 month old (who doesn't have all of her teeth) was able to eat this.  Will use again. Thanks Jill.",

I decided to use London Broil because it was on sale. This is definitely a thicker, tougher cut of meat and needs a longer marinating time - 48 hours. I know that seems like a bit much but trust me it will pay off in the end. I used this marinade for 1 & 1/2 pounds of steak. I used kosher salt, low sodium soy sauce, olive oil vs. veg., chili sauce vs. ketchup, and added a splash of white wine vinegar. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go, turning it every so often and rubbing the marinade into the meat. After it's grilled to your liking cut against the grain and serve with a baked potato and fresh garden salad!",

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I added more garlic - I used 3 Tbsp of minced bottled garlic.  I think that was perfect.  I marinated the meat for almost 24 hours, and since there was snow outside on our grill ;) I broiled the steak in the broiler for approx. 8 min. per side, and sliced very thin.  Take the meat out while it still looks a little too rare, because it will keep cooking, and it definitely is better on the rare side.  Overall, excellent marinade.  Will make again.",

                "reviewBody": "Since others seemed to be confused about the use of flank steak in this london broil recipe,(which by the way was wonderful!..a keeper) this is the definition from wikipedia: London broil is a North American beef dish made by broiling or grilling marinated flank steak, then cutting it across the grain into thin strips. The origin of the name is obscure; the food is unknown in London, England.\nMany American butchers will label a cut of meat \"London broil\". This is confusing as the term does not refer to a specific cut of meat, but a method of preparation and cookery. The cut of meat traditionally used is flank steak, but in recent years butchers have erroneously labeled top round roast/steak as London Broil. Because the muscle fibers run the entire length of this cut, the meat can be tough if not tenderized via pounding or massaging. Scoring, stabbing, cutting, penetrating, or otherwise mutilating the cut before sending it into the broiler results in a tougher finished product as it allows all the desirable juices to run out of the meat into the pan.",
