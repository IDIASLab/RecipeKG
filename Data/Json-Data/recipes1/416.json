This is similar, however in making this recipe as written, the dough was already getting brittle after I mixed in the first cup of flour... but it was such a lovely deep brown color and the spices were already smelling so wonderful that I refused give up! I kept adding melted butter and sugar till I got the right consistency while mixing in the second cup of flour. All told, I added 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter and 1 cup melted brown sugar, plus an extra 1/2 tsp. of all the spices. I skipped the oil altogether. It was worth the effort and the cookies came out just as delicious as I'd initially hoped! These crunchy, spicy treats make a delightful contrast on a Christmas cookie tray with richer sweet items.",
