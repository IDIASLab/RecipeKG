Athough the recipe doesn't specify it, I HIGHLY suggest using sweetened coconut. Also, I subsituted one of the tsps of vanilla extract for almond extract, which worked great. I definitely suggest mixing the extract(s) into the condensed milk before adding to the coconut mix - that way you are sure the flavor is evenly distributed throughout the dough. Molding the cookies was a quite a sticky process, so I just dipped a couple of fingers in a little bit of water as I patted down the dough so that I could get the cookies into a solid shape and still be able to get them onto the cookie sheet in one piece. As an aside, I have made chocolate macaroons before by adding a square (or two) of melted unsweetened bakers chocolate to the condensed milk mix, and I am sure that would work for this recipe as well. Or you could try pressing a maraschino cherry into the top of each cookie - it makes for a very classy presentation - people love it!",

I did use sweetened flake coconut, since that was what I had in the house -- but I think that was the intent here, anyway. I also refrigerated the dough for a couple of hours before scooping it out (didn't intend to, just had to stop for a kid emergency). These turned out great. Didn't stick to the parchment. Were great warm from the oven, and almost better the 2nd day.  The only thing I think I'll change next time is to bake them a little longer (as others have suggested) to bring out more of the toasted flavor.",
