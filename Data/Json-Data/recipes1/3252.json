I used it without adding the baking powder on my second batch and they came out perfectly! Instead of the decoration described in the recipe I used linzer cookie cutters to cut a design in the tip cookie. A great tip I discovered is to warm the jam in the microwave. Then I just spooned it onto the bottom cookie and placed the top layer on it. It oozed up into the cut out perfectly and looks like stained glass a bit when it cools. I ran out of jam (I made so many!) so I had an idea to use white chocolate. I melted the white chocolate added a few drops of green food coloring and used it for filling the cookies with Christmas tree cutouts. I added sprinkles before the chocolate cooled. Yum!",
