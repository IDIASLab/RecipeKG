I did add the optional miniature semi-sweet chocolate morsels - I had less than the full 1/2 cup on hand but more than 1/3 so let's call it a \"scant\" 1/2 cup. And I also used genuine Reddi-wip but I didn't opt for the additional whipped cream or crushed candy. It was a bit unusual to use the whipped cream as an ingredient in the pie filling instead of as a topping but that made the filling that much tastier. And I love graham cracker pie crusts. I highly recommend this for any chocolate pie lovers out there.",

It's chocolate after all.",
