While the soup was simmering the pleasant aroma brought back memories of my Hungarian grandmother's kitchen when I was a child many years ago. My husband and I both loved the gulyas. It tasted very Hungarian despite the lack of beef. I only made 2 modifications. I had to use regular paprika (not Hungarian) as it was not available in my supermarket and I did not use the vegetable protein. I will definitely make this again as my husband raved about it.",

                "reviewBody": "There is something seriously wrong with the proportions in this recipe. I had doubts at first but since there was a 4-star rating I decided to try it. First of all the recipe says it serves 3 servings at 1 000 calories each. That's fine--I figured that had to be a mistake and should be say 6 servings instead. Second I had never tried TVP before but had misgivings about using 8 ounces and putting it all in the broth so early. Still that's what the recipe says so I did it. It ended up soaking up a lot of the liquid so I had to keep adding more. All in all the combined amounts of vegetables and TVP made the soup very chunky and I had to double (at least) the amount of liquid. Didn't even bother making the noodles--I would have ended up with enough food to feed an army! This makes 8 to 10 servings for me. I doubled the paprika and pepper because having to add so much more liquid made the soup more bland.",

Hubby didn't like the thick dumpling/noodles much but he ate it because it's healthy. We thought it was bland flavorless. Guess we're just not a Hungarian family at heart. Used Sweet Hungarian Paprika and followed instructions save for the vegetable protien I crumbled two Original Garden Burgers in. Even added some summer squash slices at the end because it just wasn't tasting like much. What do I do with the rest???",
