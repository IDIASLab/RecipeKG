A few slight differences - her recipe called for pecans instead of walnuts 2 tablespoons of grated orange peel and only 8 oz. of dates; it was baked at 325. She always used a large (16 x 5 x 5) loaf pan. In recent years I've been the one who bakes it each December. The cake always collapsed when the glaze was poured over it so a couple of years ago I tried heating the glaze in the microwave first. It works! The cake remains full size.",
