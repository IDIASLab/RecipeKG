I followed the recipe directions exactly with the exception of using a boneless pork loin roast (4 lbs). I cut the cooking time down to 4-1/2 hours. I also added some Worcestershire sauce to the meat when I put it in the crock pot. I used apple juice. I think a lot of reviewers were expecting the pan sauce to turn out like a thick gravy but it is really more of a light sauce that you drizzle over the meat. It takes awhile to reduce I'd say 20-30 minutes but it's worth it. No thickeners needed. I love the subtle sweetness and the mustard flavor is fabulous with the pork. I served it with buttermilk garlic mashed potatoes green bean casserole and cresent rolls. Everyone's plates were clean! I can't wait to make this again! 10 stars Chef John!",

Then pour apple juice or cider over it. When done after about 6 hours on low. I drain liquid and make thickening of flour and cold juice or cider in a jar to make gravy.
