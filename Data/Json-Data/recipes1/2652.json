I'm a huge fan of all things peanut butter and chocolate, so I rolled the dough out flat and spread a mixture of 2T cocoa and 3T sugar plus about 1/3c of coarsely chopped semisweet chocolate over the top. I rolled it and cut it in half and placed the dough in 2 loaf pans with the seam side down and baked at 350 for 25 minutes. Once it cooled it tasted and looked amazing with an awesome flakey and light texture. The PB wasn't noticeable at first (even though I added a full cup instead of the 2/3) but as it cooled it was more pronounced. Just delicious!",

After it came out of the bread machine it was really really moist not at all normal bread consistency. I waited to see if it would be better the next day and it was it was more firm; however I was still not impressed with the taste. PLEASE!! don't toss this recipe aside until you've tried it yourself though. Just because someone gives a low rating doesn't mean it's a bad recipe and no good. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes. What I like you may not like and what you like I may not like. We all have our different tastes; this bread just didn't tickle my taste buds. Other's really enjoyed it so try it. You have nothing to lose. If you like it then you have a great new recipe. If not then you won't be missing out on anything.",
