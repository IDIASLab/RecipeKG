I have made some changes that I think add more flavour. I now really enjoy the recipe. To start, I heat about 1 tbsp. of sesame oil, 1 tbsp of minced gingeroot and 1 tbsp. of minced garlic in pan. Then I cooked chicken until no longer pink. I then added the veggies and cook for about 3 minutes. I then add coconut milk, 1 tbsp. lime juice, 2 1/2 tsp. of thai green curry paste, 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 tsp. chili powder. I also serve it with a garnish of sesame seeds or chopped cashews. The sauce is still rather thin but I still enjoy it over jasmine rice.",

I'm all about high blood pressure (just kidding);) Anyway I added about a tsp of salt to the chicken and curry powder as well as a little cayenne pepper. As I sauteed the chicken I added about two tsp of fish sauce (what is Thai food without fish sauce??) I didn't have any jasmine rice on hand so I used short grain sticky rice and oh my goodness...the way that coconut sauce melds with the rice is pure ambrosia! I also wouldn't say this is a lower fat recipe if you use a can of regular coconut milk as the recipe states it is nearly pure fat! 12 grams per serving to be exact...but we live once and I personally wouldn't substitute low fat coconut milk in this recipe...so I'm all about clogging my arteries as well LOL but who cares this was DELICIOUS!

FANTASTIC! use this recipe like a base and go wild. it really is that good. yes its a thin sauce but i like it like that.",

Maybe I'm just used to eating more Thai dishes because I live in NYC and there are lots of great Thai restuarants but this is NOT how Thai food should taste. There was no flavor in the broth other than a light hint of curry powder from the chicken. The veggies didn't have any flavor to soak up so they didn't taste like anything. Overall very bland but if you don't usually eat flavorful Thai food maybe this recipe is for you. Is it very simple to make so that's why it gets 2 stars instead of 1.",
