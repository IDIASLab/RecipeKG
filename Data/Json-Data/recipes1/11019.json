Oh, and he didn't know we had ham, so he only used the ham hocks. Still, this was deee-lish. I actually had seconds, which I hardly ever do. Oh, and you have to cook them longer than 2 1/2 hours. Just test them every half hour or so after that, and throw the ham in when they're about done. BTW, if you cook dried beans to death and they are still gritty or mealy, it's because they're too old; even dried beans don't last forever. They have a moisture content that lessens with age. No recipe can make old beans taste good.",

And I never take the time to soak my dried beans.  I \"de-gas\" them by just covering them with water, adding about a tablespoon of baking soda, and bringing them to a rolling boil - about 3 times.  After each boil, drain and run clean water over them to remove the husks.  Then add the rest of your ingredients and cook away!  You'll find the other beans/peas give your soup a much more \"full\" flavor.  And the \"de-gassing\" ... well... de-gasses them! LOL  Try it - I think you'll like it.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a good basic recipe with one improvement.  The secret to any good soup is the stock from which it is made.  So first, the ham stock should be made separately from any other ingredients because it takes a few hours to get the ham flavor fully out of a ham bone.  I would also use ham hocks in addition to (or in lieu of) the ham bone, because ham hocks have many joints and contribute a lot of protein richness to the stock.  A properly done stock will actually gel if stored in fridge - the gel is the protein not the fat.  Once the stock is made, you can strain it and toss the ham hocks and bone out because if done correctly, the flavor from the hocks and bones has now been transferred into the stock.\r\n\r\nOnce the stock is done, add the beans only, and cook till done.  Finally add the more tender ingredients like veggies and ham meat.  Cook as long as you like for your veggie tenderness.\r\n\r\nLike any soup, it benefits from a night in the fridge before eating!",

Use chicken broth (mostly), leave out the salt (my ham had enough), and cook in the crock pot (that's the easiest way, since the beans do have to cook a while).  I soaked the beans overnight, then put EVERYTHING in the crock pot and cooked from 9 - 5 on HIGH. Puree about 4 cups of mixture in blender around half way through and put back into pot (makes it creamier).  Add more broth/water if it's too thick.  Take out bay leaves and bone at the end, and cool for a little while if you want (will be really hot if you don't). Husband and kids 8 and 11 loved it. 6 yr old...well, she's still picky.",
