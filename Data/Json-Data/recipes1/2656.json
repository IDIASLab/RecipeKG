If you like a tart dessert this is it!!! Serve each piece topped with Cool Whip or real whipped cream. EXCELLENT!!!",

In the past I have been guilty of making reviewer-suggested changes to a recipe the first time I try it. This time I did not and I'm glad I didn't. The recipe is perfect as is. I would suggest you make this recipe according to the original instructions before trying the suggestions for changes. I really did not think it was too sweet at all. It's like I expect a gelatin salad to be. If you make sure that the cream cheese is completely at room temperature and the gelatin is completely set you will have no problem spreading the cream cheese. Also the pineapple juice that you add to the cream cheese gives it the perfect amount of sweetness--no need to add Splenda. I have tried many different gelatin salad recipes but I think this will be the only salad I make for future Thanksgivings.",
