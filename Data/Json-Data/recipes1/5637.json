I'm going to say what I did to put out a few more ideas to people who might try this recipe.\r\n\r\nI used 2 1/2 cups water, brown rice, 2 cloves minced garlic, olive oil instead of butter since I didn't have much butter around, and I skipped the step with bouillion and 1 tbsp. water.  \r\n\r\nThe extra water is for the brown rice, which needs more water  I ended up with a little extra liquid, but it was absorbed when my food cooled off.  Next time I will use 2 1/4 cups water.  I parboiled the rice for 20 minutes with the bouilion, water, onion, oil, and 2 cloves minced garlic so I wouldn't have to bake it longer, as brown rice takes two to three times longer to cook than white rice.\r\n\r\nI removed the skins to cut the fat content and shook lemon pepper on top of the thighs before baking.  I also added some sliced chile peppers and fresh parsley before baking because I like heat.  If you add fresh parsley, you will get more taste if you add it toward the end of baking, which I forgot to do.\r\n\r\nI ended up baking it 45 minutes to make sure the rice cooked through.  You won't need to cook it as long if you use small thighs and white rice, though.\r\n",

Season chicken (thighs OR drumsticks) with S&P and brown for 4-5 minutes per side. Remove from pot. Saute the onion (and celery, carrots, mushrooms) for 2-3 minutes in the same pot. Then add rice, broth, melted butter, and Italian seasoning (only 1/2 tsp.) and stir together. Put browned chicken on top of rice and cover with a tight fitting lid. Bake for 35-45 minutes.

Then I added 1/2 cup white wine (since some reviews indicated more liquid AND more flavor is needed), black pepper, 2 cloves crushed garlic and a nice amount of fresh parsley.  With these modifications, I give this recipe a 4 and a half.  I like that the rice goes in the mix too -- it's one less pot to clean! I used Carolina white rice since the cooking time is a bit longer than some other white rice brands.",

Instead of butter, I used olive oil, and I added a half cup more water.  I also chopped a clove of garlic with the chopped onion.  I didn't use bouillon cubes and instead used chicken broth, and I threw in some frozen vegetables (peas and carrots) with the rice, and a few cherry tomatoes from the garden.  I added some garlic powder to the spices as well.  To ensure everything cooked evenly, I stirred the rice a couple times during cooking and turned the chicken over as well.    This was really easy to make and the whole thing was ready in about an hour (prep and cooking), so it was a great meal to make after a long day at work.  My boyfriend raved about it and had seconds, and continued raving about it long after we'd finished eating.  It's definitely something I'll make again.",

Next time, I don't think I will add any fat, the thighs don't need it.  I also covered it.
