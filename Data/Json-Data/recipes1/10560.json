Also, as many other reviewers have noted, if you cook a bord this size and weight for the suggested amount of time, it comes out dry...even at low temperatures (300 F). Using my method, I cooked my 6lb. duck and it was done within 2hours and 20minutes, far below the time limit set for this recipe for a smaller duck.\r\n\r\n Since it only takes about 20 minutes per pund for a duck to cook at 375 uncovered, and an extra 5 minutes with it covered at 300F, I used a combination of both to achieve a tender and still crispy duck. First,I set the oven to 375F.\r\n\r\n Since I was doing a 6lb. duck, I had to adjust all of the ingredients by and additional half. for the rub portion, I also found it was necessary to add some additional spice/herbs since I know that ginger and basil alone aren't enough for my pallete. I added about 2 tablespoon's worth of a combination of equal parts rosemary, sage (ground), marjoram, thyme and oregano. If you don't have a mortar&pestil, you get a simmilar blend that works the same way from the Spice Hunter brand of seasonings; it's called \"Poultry Seasoning\".\r\n\r\n",

I added water with a bit of orange concentrate on the bottom of the pan to use for basting, the rest of the concentrate I brushed over the duck, then lightly dusted a touch more seasoning on.  My husband, 2 year old son and myself devoured the whole thing in one sitting, and if a picky toddler will eat this, then it deserves 10 stars!  :)  Thank you for sharing the recipe!",

There was a hint of the exotic that my family really liked. Also I turned the duck over (breast up) about 45 minutes before finished in order to have a lovely dark skin presented on the platter. Oops one other thing.. I totally filled the cavity of the duck with orange and squeezed the cooked orange juice onto the meat before serving. Thanks!",

I made my own mango chutney which included fresh ginger root and honey vinegar and nutmeg cloves cinnamon fresh herbs like basil and some brown sugar and stuffed the inside of (both ducks) with the chutney and orange 1/4's. I made the glaze (suggested here) and it was beautiful!!! I even made an orange mango gravy that was rich in flavor of fresh fruits and herbs. I will definately use this recipe again and again and again...It came out perfectly cooked and tender after two hours and a half (they were 5 lb ducks!).
