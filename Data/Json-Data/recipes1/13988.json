For more intense \"chocolatiness\" I also added 1 tsp. of chocolate extract. I don't know if these additions and changes were necessary, but I do know this was one fantastic cookie! Everything was just perfect--it's an attractive cookie, perfectly shaped (I used a small ice cream scoop), kind of almost pebbly on the top. The texture was also perfect-- a little crackly, chewey on the outside, and melt-in-your mouth soft on the inside. Instead of chocolate chips I used chopped Andes mints, and the taste combination was out of this world, with no hint of cake mix taste. The flavor variations with this recipe are, of course, endless, but I enjoyed this combination so much I don't know that I'll bother trying it any other way. I do know, however, that I won't be making this with a yellow cake mix as the cake mix taste is hard to cover up. I also know this is only the first of many times I will come back to this easy and delicious recipe.",

I've noticed with this and other cake mix cookie recipies that the cookies do not spread while baking, so unless you want puffy round drops, you need to flatten the cookies out a bit before you put them in the oven.",

I've tried 3 other cake mix cookies from this site, and this is by far #1.  You can use any kind of cake mix, I like Butter Yellow because is gives a nice buttery taste and I took another reviewer's advice and added 2 tablespoon oil.  This keeps the cookie SUPER moist.  Definitely an 8 min. cookie if you want moist & chewy and stays this way for days--if it last that long in your house.  Great to make with kids, many variations possible and good for giving or when you're in a pinch.  Look no further for the 'short-cut' cookie recipe!!  I love these!

You practically can't mess these up! I love to use butter pecan cake mixes or red velvet with cream cheese frosting! My husband likes a spice cake mix with a packet instant oatmeal, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup riasins. They seem to stay soft even without being sealed extra tight. My best advice, don't overbake them and you'll never go wrong. A great thing to experiment with, get the kid's involved!",

I brought them to a family BBQ where they were given rave reviews! If you're short on time then these are the cookies for you.  I gave it 4 stars for the quickness it takes to make them and great taste! I would definitely make these again if I was running short on time and needed cookies fast.
