Rarely does my husband request a salad for dinner - but since I discovered  this recipe last year he requests it on a regular basis now.

I used shredded cheddar an unpeeled gala apple and I toasted my almonds (spread on cookie sheet bake at 350 for 8-10 minutes or until fragrant). Toasting nuts of any kind really enhances their flavor. I didn t toss this I just layered the ingredients on a salad plate and drizzled with dressing which was Poppy Seed Salad Dressing by Gay Nell Nicholas also on this site. All in all a nice flavor combination.",
