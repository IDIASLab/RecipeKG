The one pro is it's very simple to prepare (and the only reason why I afforded it 3 stars instead of 2). It smelled wonderfully while cooking, but was far too plain to consume. It needs an oomph to it. It's very thin and unsubstantial. I would consider using this as a crust for some type of pie or custard, other than that, I won't be making this again.
