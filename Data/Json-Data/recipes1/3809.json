I did modify it (trying to cut out white sugar) by using Splenda and brown sugar substite also used a can of sliced apples and one can of apple topping. Also used marscapone instead of sour cream. Amazingly wonderful stuff. Look forward to doing 'variations' on this (I am a chef) like bananas foster lasagna pineapple lasagna or blueberry lasagna- this should be a BIG hit at the next potluck... Thanks...(the mexican lasagna was also terrific)",
