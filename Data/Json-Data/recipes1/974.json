So how anybody could say this recipe needs to be taken off the list is totally absurb to me and probably they probably didn't follow the directions correctly.  This is definitely an easy no fail recipe. I also have used various flavorings combinations and all have worked out very well.  This cake is very moist, easy to make and very delicious.",

I looked up every \"pound cake\" recipe saw this one tried it and it was fantastic--rich and dense. I had no lemon extract so I subsituted lemon zest and it worked just as well giving it a nice fresh taste amongst the buttery richness. I filled it with white chocolate-almond buttercream and it actually complemented the cake. I'm going to make this again this time I'd fill it with chocolate ganache.:D",

I noticed that there was no leavening in the cake at all so decided to add 1 tbsp baking powder 1/2 tsp. baking soda and 1/2 tsp. salt to the flour. Additionally I sifted the flour to keep it from getting too dense. I didn't have any lemon extract so I ended up using almond and vanilla extract. The result was a very good tasting cake. For those that are having trouble with seepage try halving the recipe and baking in a smaller tube pan. For those who are having density problems start playing with adding a little bit of leavening. Mine came out much lighter than I was intending to but I'd rather have that than too dense a cake!",

It's compact and dense,  just as it should be,  but it's also moist, which isn't always a guarantee with other pound cake recipes. I used the batter for cupcakes, and frosted them with \"Special Buttercream Frosting,\" also from this site.  I made the batter exactly as written and I liked the addition of the lemon extract. This is such a good, basic, pound cake recipe, however, that it would be fun to experiment with any number of flavorings.
