Keep a careful eye on the potatoes carrots and celery while boiling so the potatoes don't get too mushy. (And try to dice the carrots small so they cook through.) I used white potatoes which worked well. I think this might benefit from substituting chicken or vegetable broth for the water. I added a European seasoning called Vegeta that I like and that perked the soup right up.",
