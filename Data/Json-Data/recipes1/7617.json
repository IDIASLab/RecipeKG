The pie was excellent. The only thing was, I wish I had waited until the next day, letting it set better before we cut it. I did wait a few hours, but the meringue was so perfect, I had to try it!! ( As a professional cook I can tell you the acid levels in the lemons are high enough to kill the harmful bacteria in the egg, and I will wash the outside of the egg with a little bleach water as an extra measure because the salmonella lives on the shell, not inside.)",

I did not even want to serve it after seeing it come out of the broiler with hardly any meringue, but my husband insisted.

A little lesson for those of you that are not successful with meringues...the egg whites MUST be at room temperature, your bowl and beaters MUST be totally clean and free of any oily residue, and your whites MUST NOT have any yolk in them, otherwise you will not get the volume, etc you need. Beat the whites until they begin to stiffen, then add your sugar and cream of tartar, continue beating until peaks form. And, for those of you who are afraid of the raw eggs...you can bake this pie at 350 for 5 min, plus the lemon juice \"cooks\" the yolk. There is nothing to fear....make it again and enjoy!!!",

I've never made it that someone hasn't ask for the recipe.  Started making it way before any salmonella scare, just use good hygiene and sanitation practices and you shouldn't have problems either.  No one has ever become ill from one of my pies.  There are no changes or \"tweaks\" to make because the pie is perfect, every time.  I will mention that nowhere in this recipe did it tell you to beat the egg whites by hand.  I guess anything's possible, but I'm sure it was intended that you use a mixer.  For those who complain that the meringue \"didn't come out\", I suggest the basics.  Let the egg whites come to near room temperature before beating, beat (WITH MIXER) until whites begin to thicken, then gradually beat it sugar.  This will insure that you get your stiffness then the sugar will create the glossiness.  I urge everyone to use the recipe as stated.  ",
