My first batch I only had one egg so I used applesauce and baking powder as a replacement and they tasted good but weren't as crispy as the second batch I made as written. Also you can use a tsp of anise extract in place of the anise seed. It gives a sharper flavor but I prefer mine with more anise. The batch in the oven now uses 3/4 of the called for amount of sugar and 1/4 molasses to try to achieve a warmer flavor. The batter tasted good so we'll see how it goes. All in all this is a great an simple recipe that's easy to experiment with. Thanks.",
