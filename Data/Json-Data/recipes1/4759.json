I made the second one with Jarslberg maybe 2 cups worth.  Even though I made a few mistakes it was FABULOUS.  I cooked them on a baking stone (great).  I plan to make it again this weekend, but with a whole chicken like I'm supposed to, I also plan to use Basmati rice for the wonderful aroma.  This was a success with the whole family (extended family included).    :)",
