Even quartered the pieces were rather large and eventually hard to \"spread\" \"Toasting\"pecans that are brown by nature was tricky but doable. The PUREE was very very thick even b4 adding the crushed pecans. \"Spreading\" the Pecan mixture was a trial. The last \"browning\" again was a trick as it was a deep brown already. The finished product was hardly a \"presentation\" dish...looked...poor. HOWEVER - the addition of the sour cream and a little more butter helped the consistency of the Pecan spread. I can see that a \"sauce\" made of pecans etc and \"poured\" over the potatoes would present better and get a a more even coating on said taters. I did like the flavor though!
