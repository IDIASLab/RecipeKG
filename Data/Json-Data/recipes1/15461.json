After that, I wept with sorrow, because there would be a last bite. Knowing that I would soon finish the succulent tri-tip steak that I had left in the marinade for a full day because I forgot I was going to cook it left me in a pool of tears... it was even harder to chew as I sobbed and sobbed... but I managed, oh yes. I managed. After a few minutes, I awoke from my bittersweet bliss, wiped away my tears and resolved myself to make this recipe... again and again. Oh joy! One thing to mention, though, is that I didn't have worchestershire sauce in the house, so I opted to use a certain brand steak sauce in its place (begins with an \"A\")as the flavor of that reminds me of the original ingredient. I'll be making this with the W sauce this week. I'll bet it's even tastier... Thanks for inventing it, YOU ROCK!!",

I've made this for approx 40 different people now, and literally each one has said that it's one of the best steaks that they have eaten.  I've also added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar at times to add a little sweetness and aid the caramelizing.  Top your hot steak with a pat of Blue Cheese Butter (softened butter whipped w/blue cheese crumbles & then refrigerated) and you'll swear you've died.  I'm making steaks again right now!",

Then pour the marinade into a pot and add the oil into the bag that the steak is still in (squish), then put it on the grill. Heat the marinade to a boil add 1/4 c butter and some brown sugar and make a reduction (add white wine if you have it). Cook it down for a while to cook off the strong vinegar taste and it will get thick. It makes a great reduction and I do not feel like I am wasting ingredients.
