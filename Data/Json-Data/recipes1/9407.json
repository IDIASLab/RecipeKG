I did boil the chicken with the onion bell pepper and salted water. However I only used two large chicken breast halves with the skin. I only boiled it for about twenty minutes. I took out the chicken pulled off skin and bones. I put the skin and bones back into the pot and allowed to boil for another 20 minutes. I shredded the chicken. Then I drained the broth but reserved it (its chicken broth I'm not throwing it away!) I made the roux and let it turn a deep reddish brown. I then added the chicken sausage onions & bell peppers and I used the broth I had made instead of water. This got and thick. I then added the shrimp seasonings and I added a ton of Old Bay Seasoning! Its very good I'm eating right now on top of steamed rice!",
