Because of the cream and egg whites, it is not as dense as traditional cheesecake, yet creamy and delicious.  The recipe photo that shows layers, is because the egg whites were not mixed into the batter enough.  Mix them in gently but thoroughly as instructed and you will not get layers.  I will make this again with one change - I will mix the graham crackers and butter and press it to the sides of the pan beforehand like most cheesecake recipes, rather than pouring the butter in and rolling the crumbs around.  This did not provide a thick enough crust, although it did not stick to the pan.  Overnight in the refrigerator is adequate for cooling.  Also, I used a 9\" springform pan, which worked perfectly.  I fear a 8\" would be too small to hold the batter.  I wrapped the bottom of the pan in tinfoil to prevent water from entering the pan and baked in a 1\" waterbath.  I almost baked without a waterbath since it seems like too much work, but it really turned out perfect baking at 300 for 90 minutes exactly.",

I have been making Maureen's recipe for over 5 years and it has been an absolute hit every time.  If I take one to a pot luck it's gone in less that 15 minutes and I've even caught people licking the pan on more than one occasion!  One day in a rush I forgot to separate the eggs and discovered this can also be a New York style cheesecake.  If you don't like the light custardy texture of this one, just don't separate the eggs.  Bake as directed, but you will end up with that thick, creamy, stick to the top of your mouth cheesecake instead.  Either way, this recipe is a keeper!  And it really is divine without any fruit or toppings. Thank you Maureen!",
