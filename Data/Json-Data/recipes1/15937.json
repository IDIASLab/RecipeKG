The 14 lb turkey was literally picked clean by the end of the night! \n\nI followed the recipe for the most part but made a few small changes. I made the overnight brine as suggested but replaced the water with chicken broth. The next morning I prepared the turkey for the oven per the recipe but added more seasonings. I added onion and garlic powder, seasoning salt, rosemary, pepper, and sage to the olive oil mixture for even more flavor. I also placed pats of butter on and under the skin of the turkey prior to roasting.  I removed the foil tent from the turkey 45 minutes prior to the end of cooking time (which was 4.5 hours). This was a very easy recipe and well received by all. You won't be disappointed!",

I pulled the turkey out at 160\u00ba (though really wanted to pull it out at 155\u00ba) and because it was done so early, I let it rest for over 2 hrs.
