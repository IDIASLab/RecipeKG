I served with parmesean/parsley mashed potatos on a large platter with lemon slices, beautiful presentation.  This dish is definitely for lemon lovers, and the flavors are mild and mellow, so you can finish the meal off with a big bang of a dessert!",

Served it over angel hair pasta and had fresh broccoli and green salad on the side. Hubby and his friend inhaled it and the kids loved it too!!! definitely a keeper will be making this again -- thanks so much for posting this recipe -",

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the amount of sauce (good thing too!). I also followed the advice of another reviewer and added two cloves of minced garlic to the pan when cooking the chicken. I don't know what I was thinking...but don't do this! The garlic cooks too long and as a result turns bitter. If you want to add garlic do so after removing the chicken; saute it a little before adding the sauce ingredients to the pan. Another point to mention is that I don't feel there is enough bread crumb mixture to coat the chicken breasts...much more is needed to get a good coating on the breasts. Anyhow in the end this dish was \"ok\" but we probably won't be making it again in our opinion it didn't have any wow factor.",

Cut the tenderloin into 1\" pieces and pound them until they're as thin as veal scallopine. Continue as if using chicken only the thin pork will only take about 2 minutes per side to brown & cook. Then continue with the rest of the recipe.",
