I added 3 tablespoons of jarred minced garlic with the onions, used italian diced tomatoes, doubled the red pepper flakes and finished it off with 1/3 cup chopped fresh basil. Served this over the \"quick gnocchi\" from this site. Absolutely amazing!",

I added 1/4 cup more heavy cream and 1/8 cup more vodka because we like saucy pasta. In addition I always make pasta with garlic weather it calls for it or not so I added one clove of minced garlic to this recipe as well as doubled the parmesan cheese (you can never have too much cheese!). I am definately making this dish again. Thanks Denise for the recipe.",
