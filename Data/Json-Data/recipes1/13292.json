Besides I still needed more pimento chesse for the party.  So, I choose to use pre-grated cheese, one (8oz) Sharp Cheddar and one (8oz) mixed Cheddar and Monterey Jack (it was on sale).  For some reason pimentos come in 2 oz ($.99), 4 oz ($1.29) and 7 oz ($1.59) jars.  I decided to use the 7 oz. since it was the best value.  I chopped the pimentos fine, used less salad dressing than called for and spiced it up with some hot sauce and a generous dash of Worcestershire Sauce.  I did a side by side comparison and I think my homemade is better than the expensive store bought stuff.  I won\u2019t be paying someone else to make mine any more!  Give it a try this recipe is pretty good.",
