Let sit for about 30 mins before putting in oven (I believe this allowed chicken to absorb the mayo a little, I had no trouble with grease.)\r\n5. Took out of oven after 18 mins; covered with about 2T of marina sauce and generous handful of shredded mozzarella cheese and put it back in oven until cheese melted. Served on top of spaghetti.",
