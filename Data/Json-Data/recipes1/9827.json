I lowered the heat to 325 degrees after some reviewers indicated they had trouble getting the cake to bake through without overbaking the exterior.  It was perfect, then, at 325 for about 60 minutes. I made this exactly as written, in spite of reviewer suggestions to add this or that. I didn't want to take away from the buttery, peachy taste--it was delicious. The sugar crust is a nice touch and I'm glad I included that too. I used frozen peaches, thawed and drained, and drizzled the baked loaf with a glaze of powdered sugar and the drained peach juice. Very pretty, moist cake, with a just right taste and speckle of peaches.",

Yes, it's that good!  I cut the recipe in half, kept the amount of vanilla the same and used a little over a cup of peaches.  I baked it in an 8x4 glass baking dish and topped it with a generous amount of turbinado sugar. I put in the oven at 325 for exactly one hour. It was so incredibly moist, delicious, and bursting with peaches. I topped the cake slices with fresh cut peaches and homemade whipped cream.  The cake basically disappeared, but this is definitely a recipe I'd love to make again!",

                "reviewBody": "A perfect way to use ripe peaches!  The sugar coating on the pan gave a nice crunch to the outside of the cake.  I used a bundt pan and baked it about 1 hr 20 min, and had no trouble getting the cake out of the pan after letting it cool for about 15 minutes.  As with any pound cake, it is important to follow the directions and beat, beat, beat the batter after each addition (except the peaches, of course). Using a stand mixer works well for the beating.  I added some nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter with the vanilla, and I think that helped bring out the flavor of the peaches.  I also dusted it with 10X sugar after it cooled.  The cake is delicious, especially when served with dark chocolate sauce.",
