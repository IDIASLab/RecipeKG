I ended up scaling this down for 1 bottle (1/5th of recipe)of wine. I love the use of pineapple juice and pineapple chunks. I ended up adding in the full 8oz can of pineapple chunks otherwise 1/5th of the can only had me adding 3 chunks to the whole sangria! I also found it to be a bit too tart so the full can of pineapple took care of the needed extra sweetness. A simple and tasty sangria. I'd recommend adding in more pineapple and letting it sit for an hour or two for the flavors to blend. I didn't like it as much when I first mixed it but after it sat for a while it really developed a nice tropical undertone.",
