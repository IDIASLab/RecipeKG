I melted 6 tb of butter with 1 tb of grated lime peel and 1 tsp of lime juice. Mix melted butter combo with 2 cups of crushed graham crackers combined with 5 tb of gran sugar. Press into 9\" springform pan and bake for 10 min at 350 F. I combined the ingredients like I would a typical cheescake. I combined sugar/cream cheese first then added vanilla and eggs one at a time then lime juice then the remaining dry ingredients. I never bake cheesecakes over 300 F so I baked this one at 300 F for about 80 min or until the middle is still slightly wiggly (if it doesn't wiggle it gets overcooked). Yes 5 packages of cream cheese makes for a very heavy cake but it turns out great. While cooling make sure to slide a plastic spatula or knife between the cake and the pan to eliminate cracks (I did not loosen the spring on the pan like the directions indicated). My cake didn't turn out too tart (I think the graham cracker crust helped sweeten things) and everybody loved it. It was perfect for my summertime bbq. Would definitely make it again.",

As well some of the amounts seemed odd to me. 5 packages of cream cheese? I used 3 and found that was more than enough. Does the springform pan have to be prepared in any way? Greased? Floured? The recipe doesn't say. Also I had some issues with the crust. I followed the recipe exactly yet as soon as I put the crust into the oven to bake for 6-8 minutes it started to slide down the sides of my pan. Also during the cooling process my cake developed a crack right in the middle. Luckily I was able to hide it with ferns lime and flowers but it was still frustrating to know that my beautiful cake was imperfect. This recipe is very time consuming and frustrating to make.",

I halved the recipe used bottled juice instead of fresh and drizzled some lime juice over a store bought graham cracker crust before filling. I took it to work and we devoured it. One woman said it was the best cheesecake she had ever tasted. Thanks! - EDIT - 4 years later I still love this. I have now made it per the recipe and it comes out a lot more tart with fresh squeezed juice but it's still delicious to me. I did get a big crack in the middle when I made the full-sized one so I covered it with garnish",
