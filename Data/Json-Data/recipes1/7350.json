The family liked it but the I found the flavor profile unimpressive.   The next time, I used the basic idea as a stew. I diced pork loin, sauteed it in a pan within olive oil, 2 cloves minced garlic, salt and pepper.  Not draining, I added 4 diced potatoes, 2 diced carrots , and 1/2 a diced onion, fresh tarragon, oregano, and rosemary.  When the potatoes started getting soft I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth, 1 can tomato soup, 1/2 tsp worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp balsamic vinegar, and  1 tbs merlot.  I brought to a simmer, covered and reduced heat and cooked for 15 min. It turned out great! I was much happier with my version but I appreciate the canvas provided by this recipe.",

I thought it was great, my husband also enjoyed, but suggested using stewed tomatoes or a light pasta sauce in place of the tomato soup.  I will try it that way next time.

I did add a sprinkle of basil, oregano, parsley and garlic powder only because I was afraid it would be too plain with just the Worcestershire. After we tried it, I think it would have been fine. No salt necessary either. Just needed something to accent the soup color. Used 3 bone-in chops that were thick and they were the juciest! Had to substitute frozen baby carrots (didn't have fresh)thawed them first.  I am a first time mom who used to work nights so I never had to cook but once a week. Now I stay home and haven't a clue how to get a meal to come together all at once. This recipe is definately going to be a keeper. Thank You!",
