Next time I make this I'm going to try to thicken the sauce a little and maybe add some seasonings for more flavor as I found it to be a bit bland. On a separate note I am making most of my 7-month daughter's baby food and I mixed some of this (minus the broth) with mixed vegetables and pear juice threw it in the food processor with some noodles and it made a great baby chicken casserole!",
