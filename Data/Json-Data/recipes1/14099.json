Frist I used canned nuts not raw didn't heat them and left out the salt since they were already salted. Then I mixed together all the sugar and spices but not the nuts in a non-stick saucepan. I added 2 teaspoons of water to the sugar/spice mixture to help dissolve everything then when it just started to boil I put the nuts in and kept stirring for about 3 minutes. Then I put the nuts in a bowl and microwaved for 2 minutes stirring every 30 seconds. This way all the nuts were not only coated but glazed as well. When they were cool they didn't stick together at all.",

I'll keep looking for a better spicy glazed nut recipe.",

I tried to figure out a way to not have them stick together like some of the other reviews said happened and I took i egg white and beat it till foamy and coated the nuts in it before coating w/ seasonings & this helped the nuts from sticking together that much. Once cooked I placed them on a flat sheet of wax paper and separated them all till dry. the one's that stuck were great though because it was like a sweet nut cluster! Great for parties!!!
