For all you Trader Joes fans I did this recipe with TJs whole-wheat penne 1 lb. green beans halved instead of snow peas and TJs Shitake Seasame Salad dressing. In order to spice it up a bit I added a little crushed red pepper and based on previous reviews I added a tablespoon of soy sauce. (FYI dont skip the ginger and garlic they really make a difference) Everyone here loved it! I will definitely make it again. Thanks",

I cooked the garlic and ginger in the sesame oil then added my Asian-style salad dressing. My dressing was sesame-oil based. The dressing had no soy sauce so I added quite a bit (then found I didn't need to add salt). Wow! Everyone liked it very much. I had so much left-over (although there were 35 people at the party there were 6 salads)... a guest needed to leave early as she was going to her brother's birthday party the same day. She asked if she could take the remainder of the pasta salad to share with them. SUCH a great banquet or potluck food. There is no meat or eggs to spoil!",
