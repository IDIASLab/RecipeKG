I cut the recipe in half and used red potatoes that I mashed with the skins. I used Land O Lakes light butter and used a mix of half and half and skim milk. I eyeballed that to get the consistency I wanted so I probably used a bit more. Overall a great side dish because there's nothing like classic comfort food and what better than taters!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is ALMOST identical to the way I make my mashed potatoes. The only significant difference - I season the potatoes after they are drained (except for a little salt in the water). They can only absorb SOME of the seasoning from the water. Why pour all of that flavor down the drain?! Minor differences - regular salt works fine in place of sea salt milk instead of heavy cream & ground white pepper instead of black (I like the way it just disappears in the potatoes versus black pepper). If you're one of those people who like lumps in your mashed potatoes by all means mash them by hand. If you're a fan of smooth like me an electric mixer is the way to go! One important note: for best results drain the potatoes as soon as they are done boiling and don't let them sit too long before beating/whipping them. If you leave them sitting in the hot water after you remove them from the heat or even if you drain them & leave them in a covered pot you will end up with pastey gooey shiny potatoes rather than fluffy ones. Something I had to learn the hard way! One last tip: I find that melting the butter & heating the milk before adding helps keep your potatoes hot. I should mention that I have not made this exact recipe with these exact measurements - just all of the same seasonings. Use more or less milk for your favorite consistancy. I have made them so many times that I just \"eyeball\" everything & let my tastebuds dictate any adjustments.",
