Next time I would either cut down on the soy sauce or use low-sodium soy sauce as it came out very salty. I would also omit the salt that goes in at the end. I used boneless chicken breasts cut into strips before being placed in the marinade. I marinated for 2-1/2 hours. Then I cooked the chicken in a cast iron skillet. This worked very well. I couldn't find unsweetened coconut so I just used sweetened. I was afraid my husband would hate it because he hates sweet and meat together but he thought it was great and said I should just use sweetened coconut rather than going out of my way to find unsweetened. I also added an extra handful of chopped green onions and my husband and I both thought it could use even more. I think next time I would also add ginger or chili flakes as others have suggested to give it some spice. I will definitely make this recipe again (with modifications).",

I added tsp ginger and red chile flakes put in lime juice and togarashi (japanese condiment that includes chile and tangerine zest) because I don't like lemon pepper so I guess I ended up making my usual yakitori.:) Old habits...
