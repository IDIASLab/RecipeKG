Because my boyfriend doesn't eat dairy and is adamant about eating low-fat I used less oil and no Parmesan. I sauteed fresh broccoli and garlic in a little olive oil and homemade chicken broth (I added the broth since I used very little oil). Then I seasoned it really well with salt pepper and a little onion powder and added cooked cubed chicken. I then tossed it in with the cooked pasta. It was excellent!!",

First I marinated two boneless skinless chicken breasts in a bottle of Italian dressing for a few hours then baked them for about an hour at 350. I used penne pasta (just because I think it holds up better) and I also did the garlic/oil combo. Tossed the pasta with the cubed chicken and broccoli; added salt and pepper and parmesan cheese. I think marinating the chicken added another layer of flavor and kept it moist. Thanks for a great idea!",

I replaced the garlic and olive oil with a blend of pesto picatta butter parmesan and juice from the cooked chicken (Note- I cooked the chicken in a pesto picatta and CURRY sauce so the juices were flavorful). I tossed the pasta with that sauce and then threw i can of sliced black olives on top. The broccoli I cooked in the same pan as the chicken so I cut the chicken and broccoli and added that ontop of the olives. Lastly I had artichoke hearts in a jar of olive oil (from costco) so I cut up a handful of those and threw those on top. I put the pot on the table for company just like that and when served all the ingredients combined nicely. It was really flavorful and unique. For my first time making this I was really happy with the results. It didn't need much salt or pepper or parmesan cheese. But I did put some extra sauce on the table in case people wanted it. The flavors combined nicely without the extra sauce but it was nice to have just in case.",
