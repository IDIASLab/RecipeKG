Suggestions for enhancing the flavor: 1/4 c tahini paste (adds a nice, nutty complexity to the flavor and helps bond the ingredients), 2Tb Worcestershire sauce (add to mushrooms while cooking), a sprinkle of Garam Masala or Curry (I have enjoyed both). This recipe also makes tasty meatballs for spaghetti-- just bake in small balls!",

I added the garlic first, letting it brown and then the onion until it became a bit glassy, just because I'm used to that order. Cut the mushrooms finely before frying using a herb chopper - same with the onions. Used probably twice the oregano, two eggs, and a few handfuls of nacho cheddar cheese. Baked them 10 mins each side at 450. Crispy, meaty, juicy, non-crumbly and delicious. These could easily pass for real meat patties.",

Before being cooked the filling was almost like a mushroom heavy stuffing. Although, I do like that they set up, after they cook, as they cool. I wouldn't recommend this to a meat burger eater, but it might be a different change to someone tired of the flavor and texture of bean burgers. It was a little salty tasting to me, and I didnt love the soft chewy texture, but I think they will all be eaten by someone in my household. I made 1/2 recipe and got 7 patties with a #16 scoop.",

I had lost my recipe so I was ecstatic to find one very close to mine.  One difference is I chop the mushrooms into medium pieces and then fry them until they are golden and leathery.  This is what gives them the meaty chewiness.  I then add the other ingredients except the oatmeal.  I am going to try my recipe with the oatmeal to see if it makes a difference. I don't use cheese in the mix and I add a tablespoon of soy sauce. I never liked the bean burgers that most vegie burgers are made of.  They don't taste anything like a hamburger.",

I also added 1 tsp of paprika to give it a little kick and made sure to cook off all the juices. I also added additional breadcrumbs and 1 additional whole egg to get the patties to stick together better. The recipe was enough for 9 diner sized burgers, and I grilled them outside for about 15 minutes on medium direct heat flipping only once. They turned out delicious, and even the carnivores didn't miss the meat. This will be a regular staple for outdoor grilling season. Easy to make",
