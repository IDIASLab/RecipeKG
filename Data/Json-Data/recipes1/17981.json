I actually had some leftover 'garlic and herb' breadsticks to use up, so I used them in place of the Italian bread (which worked out great), and omitted the thyme (we don't care for it). I added no other herbs b/c the bread had enough. This was very nice and super simple to put together. Hubby said that it sort of reminded him of stuffing, but more 'gourmet', and I agree! I think that you could use any herbs that you like and come out w/ something delicious. I didn't really have anything to serve this w/, I just made it b/c I needed to use up the bread, but I could totally see this going great w/ a steak dinner, as mentioned. I will def use this recipe again, and I can't wait to play around w/ the herbs/spices! Thanks for sharing. :)",
