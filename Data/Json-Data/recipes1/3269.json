I cannot believe that this is the 5 star recipe. I will never make this again but I would use only ONE cup of suger in the cream cheese mixture but use two eggs in the cake mix instead.",

I normally love cream cheese filling but this turned out runny and WAY TOO SWEET. The cake base/pastry is wonderful I would concoct a different filling one more in line with a cheese cake filling that is not so runny and not so sweet. This smelled much better than it tasted in my experience with it.",
