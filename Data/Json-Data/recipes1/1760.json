First I mixed the sugar and butter until fluffy,then added the eggs 1by1, then having put all the dry ingredients together beforehand I added a little at a time alternating with the milk. Lastly, I added the vanilla. It turned out very light and fluffy and tasty too!!",

I made this for a co-worker's baby shower cake and brought sample cake made from this recipe and from a very traditional marble cake recipe to the office for them to pick their favorite.  This recipe was the unanimous favorite.  I made changes as suggested by the other reviewers:  added 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup melted shortening to the batter;  I also mixed the cocoa with 1 Tablespoon melted shortening prior to mixing into the batter.  I also was careful to not overbake the cake. It was moist and full of flavor, absolutely delicious!  No cracking of the top, either, and it rose high and light.  This is the easiest \"from-scratch\" cake I've ever made.",

For example, I used 3 cups of flour, 3 teaspoons baking powder, etc. \n\n The only thing I did differently was that I took other users advice and used additional 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup oil. Plus I added 1/2 a package of instant vanilla pudding and 1/2 cup extra milk. The cake evenly filled the pan to about 3 1/2 inches high baked and is EXCEPTIONALLY moist and flavorful. This is from now on going to be our family's standard birthday cake. Thanks for the GREAT recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "This is an amazing cake. I doubled it for two 9 layers adding 25% more sugar and 50% more butter (salted) as other reviewers suggested. With three sticks of butter and all of four eggs it was practically torte! Light crumbly and heavy all at the same time. Add to that the butter cream icing and well they loved it. Even so I would say it's flavor was pretty mellow due to all the eggs and butter. I think you could fix this cake s flavor problem as noted by other reviewers by doubling the salt. My best yellow cake recipe calls for lots of eggs and butter as well but about double the salt. A little extra vanilla or higher quality vanilla will round out the flavor as well. Next time I will use salted butter again just not so much of it and double the salt add a little extra vanilla and no extra sugar. Oh and one more thing I am a purist about presoaking baking flour before cooking with it (or using sprout flour) so for this recipe I mixed the flour milk and salt in the evening around 7 p.m. and let it sit at room temperature overnight. The next morning I mixed the remaining ingredients in a separate bowl added the flour mixture to it and baked it in two insulated 9 round pans for about 45 minutes. Worked out awesome.",
