My boyfriend asked me to find this dish because he said it was something his grandma used to make (before she passed) for special occassions when he was younger. I've never heard of this before, there were few reviews, and the combo of ingrediants got me worried but I really wanted to surprise my boyfriend. I reduced the pineapple ALOT and didn't use any coconut. When he came home and saw this dish on the dinner table, he was very happy. The taste is nothing like I've ever had before but it was very good and my boyfriend said it was just like his grandma's, which I'll accept as a huge compliment! Thank you Nancy - for teaching me something new and providing me another way to make my bofriend really happy!",

In the crock pot I dump the following: frozen chicken 2 cans cream of chicken soup 1 can chicken broth and let it cook all day while I'm at work. The chicken shreds itself nicely. Then I make white rice in my rice cooker ( 10 from target). Then let everyone add pineapple chunks cheddar cheese chopped celery and chow mein noodles. Its Fantastic and SUPER EASY!!",

I left out the pimentos and it was good without it but the saltiness of the pimentos would probably be good too! Over all i really liked it and loved how quick it was put together. I will make it again but likely not with my kids around:)",
