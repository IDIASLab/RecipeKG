First, next time I will finely dice the apples and mix into the batter and then proceed to use the steusel in layers as directed  I used a combination of lowfat sourcream, yogurt and applesauce.  Excellent results.  Flavor of the coffeecake is also enhanced by lemon or orange zest.  For appearance I made a thin frosting and drizzled on the top.  Not to much, just for effect.  Once you make this recipe you will keep it near by to repeat and repeat.  Thanks Kris!",

I will warn the future bakers with a few tips: 1) This takes at least 60 minutes if not more. I think I wound up cooking it for almost 70 minutes because the apple section seemed gummy when I first turned the cake out of the pan. I wound up putting it back in the pan (no major feat!) and putting it back in the oven after it had cooled for the 15 minutes. 2) Put a cookie sheat under the bundt pan in the oven because the batter JUST fits and you might get a tiny spill. I am sure you could also do this with muffins but the layering in each muffin cup might take time.",
