This is the best kind of fruit salad in existence!  I love the peach pie filling trick.  It is a sweet glaze without being too sweet.  This lasts in the fridge for a few days and makes fantastic breakfast leftovers!  Try mangos, mandarin oranges, and finely sliced apples.  This is a very elegant and wonderful fruit salad for guests as well.",
