For those who want to try this in the future and read the latter reviews the seizing up of the caramel is normal. You have to bring it back to a boil and redissolve the caranel then continue with the recipe. Also add a tablespoon of light corn syrup with the milk and sugar to help with early crystalization which leads to graininess. I like this recipe better than what most people consider caramel icing which is really penuche. (nothing against penuche that is yummy also) This technique has a true caramel flavor. Hope this helps everyone.;-)",

It did set up when I added the boiling water but after about 15 minutes it was liquid again. After cooling I popped it back in the mixer for a few minutes and it looked just like my grandmother's caramel icing. Tastes like it too. The only bad thing is that my toddler picked that moment to get hurt so I walked away from the icing. Upon my return it was already set up in the bowl. After a minute in the microwave it was able to spread it on the cake and it set right back up. Excellent recipe! I doubled it with no problems whatsoever and the only change I made was a little extra salt because it tasted really sweet... possibly from doubling the recipe though. Thumbs up! I'll try this one again!",

I thought adding the other ingredients (ie more liquid) would alleviate the problem but the whole thing become one huge hard rock! I now have brittle instead of icing. I think the trick is not to over-caramelize the sugar - add the water BEFORE the sugar melts and recrystalizes. Once the crystals form you're in trouble.",
