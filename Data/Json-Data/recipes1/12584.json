So when my son asked for oatmeal cookies of course I went to Allrecipes.com. to find a decent recipe. I found this recipe and boy are we yes I said we hooked. I made the first batch and because they didn't last but a day my son requested that we make some more the next day. I was very busy so my 15 year son made them on his own. Very good recipe - I did make a few changes. I always undercook our cookies because we like them soft and chewey. I also added 1/2 cup of shredded coconut and 1/2 of butterscotch chips. Delicious!!",

Most cookie recipes don't require the sheet to be greased and considering how buttery these cookies are it really doesn't need to be. I find greasing the sheet makes them more crispy and brown on the bottom. Just gently lift cookies with a spatula after letting them sit on the sheet a few minutes. This makes tons of cookies. I even refrigerated half the recipe because I got sick of standing in the kitchen.",
