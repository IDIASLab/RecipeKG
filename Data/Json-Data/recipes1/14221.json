It was a little bland but I just added some chopped fresh sage and a little season salt and it turned out great!  And you can't beat it for healthy.  For my husband I stirred a 1/4 c of chopped proscuitto (you could use ham too) into his and he loved it. I also doubled the potato as per previous reviews here and I loved the thick texture. I will definitely put this in our monthly rotation - thanks Lon!",

I added a couple more potatoes requiring me to add a little bit of water (in addition to the chicken broth) and since I only had 16 ounces of frozen broccoli I used some fresh broccoli as well. I also added 1/4 cup of half and half at the end just to make it a little creamier. I wouldn't have touched this as a kid but now that I have realized how wonderful broccoli truly is I loved this soup!",
