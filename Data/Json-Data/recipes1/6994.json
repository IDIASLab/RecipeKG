Watercress is also 4 a bunch here so I used half watercress and half spring mix to help even out the cost. This is a great recipe and the only thing I would change is to use more mustard as others have suggested. I used bay scallops because they are more affordable right now but sea scallops would be excellent too. Keeper!",
