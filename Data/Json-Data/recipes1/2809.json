After reading the other reviews and making this for myself I've come to this conclusion...When \"blanching\" your veggies cook them until the are the tenderness YOU like. I cooked mine quite a bit longer than the recipe called for. When making the sauce I did NOT add the pepper at all. I figured that is something that could be added at the table to an individuals liking. If serving to guests be prepared to share the recipe! This one's a keeper!",
