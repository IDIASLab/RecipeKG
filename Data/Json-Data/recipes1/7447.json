I wanted a chunkier soup, so I just mashed the tender cauliflower with a potato masher for thicker bits instead of running it in the blender. When sauteeing the garlic and onion, I threw in two chopped red peppers that were about to go south  I used heavy cream instead of milk and SLJ6 was right on about the thyme. I did add a bit of red pepper flake after trying it. Very good soup. This will be quite nice to eat on all week. Makes a lot so make sure you really like this or you have family that loves soup.",
