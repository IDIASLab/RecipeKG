I absolutely loved the cinnamon roll texture and the frosting is to die for! I used a spoonful of orange juice concentrate (probably a tiny bit more than a tablespoon). If you are not a big frosting eater you could probably cut the frosting recipe in half although I wouldn't recommend it because it's so good you'll want to pile it on. Be aware though that any leftover frosting won't keep in the fridge. The only changes I made were no nuts because my husband is allergic and I added 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. Oh and don't be afraid if the dough seems stiff. I actually broke a spatula in half stirring it. My recipe made 24 TB size cookies.",
