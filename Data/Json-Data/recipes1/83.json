I did have to make a few changes due to ingredients I had on hand - too lazy and cheap to go to the store - but honestly, they are GOOD!\nI used walnuts and black walnuts instead of almonds ( I like them more and didn't have any almonds), also, used Kaluah plus Jim Beam coffee whiskey (serving size bottle) with a little molasses thrown in for sweet. I used powdered sugar instead of granulated just for palatability, and rolled them in a mixture of 1 tbsp cocoa powder and 1/3 C powdered sugar. When I had to dilute the mixture (it was just too crumbly) I used a little expresso I had brewed - about 2 tbsp. \nI had my hubs do the taste test - he's kinda picky. He LOVED them! The black walnuts are a real standout and go great with the Kaluah flavor. \nThis recipe is SO forgiving that you can do myriad things with it. Go nuts! Thanks for a great basic recipe!",
