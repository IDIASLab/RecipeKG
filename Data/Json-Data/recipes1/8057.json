My husband didn't care too much for them he said they were too cake-like. After seeing how large they became after the first pan I made them a little smaller after that and total I made 60 cookies. The second time I make these I used green food coloring for the frosting for Christmas. I would not recommend making these without the frosting. This may sound crazy but they taste better the day after making them. Yummmy...Thanks for sharing!!!",

They won't replace my sugar cookie recipe for special occasions but they are nice for a quick and easy change. We made them for my kids to play \"tea party\" with and they were a big hit with the kids. Definitely more cake-like than cookie but they made a perfect tea cake. Glad we tried this one out.",
