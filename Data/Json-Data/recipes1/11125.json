Instead of doubling the soy sauce like other reviewers, I added Oyster Sauce (about 2 tbsp.). I am Asian, and oyster sauce is used substantially in brown sauces. I did not add as much broth, but eyeballed the amount of liquid I wanted as a sauce. I also used maybe 3 tbsp. of cornstarch and that was thick enough. Also, I added chopped garlic in the oil first and fried the chicken. Then I seasoned with salt, pepper and onion powder for an extra kick. I also added some chopped green onion (scallions) with the celery. The textures were wonderful and the taste sensational. If you finish the sauce with a few drops of sesame oil, it will taste as authentic as a real Chinese restaurant!",

I only used about 2 tbs of oil 3/4 c of broth bean sprouts instead of bamboo shoots(yuck) and I totally omitted the water cornstarch mix. (I did that cuz who needed it with the cut down liquid?) I also used some crushed garlic with the oil and I used garlic pepper and garlic salt instead of plain salt and pepper. We all ate it we all liked it. I will make it again. Thanks for posting it!!",

I pretty much cut the recipe in half since there is only two of us-used one can of chicken broth and a whole can of water chestnuts. I included some larger slices of onion like you get at the restaurants-I let those simmer/cook in the sauce until soft. Plus, I used Tamari sauce instead of soy. The flavor was wonderful!
