I substituted pineapple tidbits, which worked out well and will do that again.  The ginger favor is subtle (maybe more next time?), but the pineapple flavor is infused into the rice very nicely.  This could be just personal  taste, but I think a 20-oz can is too much pineapple.  I started folding the pineapple in, and stopped short of using all of it.  In the future, I will try using an 8-oz can of pineapple tidbits and then adding pineapple juice. I wanted rice with pineapple, not pineapple with rice, if that makes any sense to you. My husband really likes rice (well, we both do), we enjoyed this, and I\u2019ll make again.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
