Tasting along the way.  I definately ended up using 2 tablespoons of lemon juice instead.  For those comments about the greyish color, add turmeric, i add it to all my potato salads, its hardly for the taste, since its so subtle, its more for a yellowish coloring.  I did not have celery so I did not use that, but Im sure it would have been much better with it.  I would have shredded some carrots for an added color but didnt have any.  This dish is definately the only potato salad dish I will ever make, to accomodate those that would not prefer eggs in this salad, the only thing I would do is serve it with and without.  Also there is no reason to add veg. oil or olive oil, you dont want that oily flavor, I just added 1 tbl of butter for a little of that flavor.  I added 1 tbl of paprika for a kick as well as a bit of lemon zest. It was divine!!",

                "reviewBody": "I love the idea of the lemon. This is very good. Measured everything exactly. 1/3 cup celery=1 stalk Used red onion instead of green. Diced my potatoes first and could see that 3 eggs would be a bit to much for me so only used 2. Thought I had season salt and had picked up 'chicken barbeque seasoning' by mistake so used 3/4 tsp. paprika and 3/4 tsp. Old Bay. This worked out very well; therefore added salt. I would agree that 1/3 c. lemonjuice is a bit tart but sometimes depends on the lemon. The nice thing about making a dressing beforehand is that one can adjust accordingly. I added a bit more sugar to cut down on the tartness and added some lemon zest to make it taste more lemony instead of just tart. This added a new dimension to the dressing. I agree that there is a bit more dressing for the 5 cups potatoes but again a personal preference. It wasn't 'soupy' but I would like it a bit less 'loose'. Next time I'll just add 1 extra potato. All in all a great recipe and will make again with the adjustments. I was tempted to throw in some dried dill as I thought that would compliment the lemon but decided against it for the review. Thanks for the nice recipe.",
