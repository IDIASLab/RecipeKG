The prep time is a little long but I freeze leftovers individually and it's a treat to have them waiting.  The amount of chicken can be changed - it really doesn't affect the flavor.

I only used 1/2 of the chicken/rice mix and froze the other 1/2 to use another day. This one is a keeper!",

So I decided to use them for this rec. I used regular onion no garlic (had it on turkey). After I sauteed onions I added turkey breast rice can of pinto beans and fresh salsa (all I had) forgot olives and did not need to use chicken stock. When heated through I spooned about 1 cup of the mixture on tortillas sprinkled with mozzarella jalapenos for hubby and rolled up. I transfered stuffed tortillas to my pan and put swiss cheese on top. Baked for 15 min on 350F. It is just two of us and so we had just perfect size lunch. I still have some leftover turkey/rice mixture which I will use tommorow to make another buritto. This way it is fresh baked. This rec is so versatile.
