Hubby who was skeptical and not fond of feta actually said \"ok we can move to greece now\";) I was actually quite proud that I made my own dresing rather than using store bought. The only thing that i changed was that i let the veggies marinate in the dressing overnight and I think it turned out excellent. Resturant quality even. Will absolutely make again.",
