The icing is so creamy and tasty! I think I'll use it again! My only complaint is the cooking time- mine were undercooked and you really can't tell because of the color of the cookie if they're cooked or not. The end result was a bit soft- like they fall apart when handled. Although this could be because of the butter? I didn't have any troubles icing them found it quite easy. All in all a great tasting cookie. Thank you!",

I frosted them with leftover frosting from \"Carrot Cupcakes with White Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting\" from this site. GREAT combo! The delicate white chocolate/orange flavor of that frosting really compliments the rich chocolate taste of these cookies. The cookies are nice soft chewy and delicious. I know they'd be great with marshmallows/chocolate frosting too. I used half whole wheat pastry flour and 1/3 cup brown sugar in place of some of the white. The dough is very soft and the cookies puff up in the oven and get a little flat when you take them out. I got 23 cookies out of this recipe using my Pampered Chef cookie scoop.",
