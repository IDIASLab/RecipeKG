I don\u2019t really know what the egg yolk does to the crumb so next time I will leave it out. They really don't hold up as bars and they are very thin. To remedy this,  I will bake the whole recipe in an 9 x 9  dish. I noticed that the sides were browning but the top was not. I popped it into my air fryer oven for 3 minutes and it came out golden brown. Thank you for the recipe.",
