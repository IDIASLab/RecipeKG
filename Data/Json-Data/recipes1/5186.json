I used brown rice penne pasta (delicious and healthy) instead of bow-tie. I didn't have any peas but wish that I did. Also I only had the little sweet peppers that you ca buy at Costco (red yellow and orange) and thought they were a great substitute for just red bell peppers. Added crushed red pepper 1/8 tsp. and 2 cloves minced garlic to the sauce just to give it a little extra kick. Then I baked some chicken brushing it very lightly with EVOO salt pepper basil and a little minced garlic. YUM!! I served this up layered--pasta chicken and smothered with the sauce.",
