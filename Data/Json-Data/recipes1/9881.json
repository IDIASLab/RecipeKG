I mixed together the soup with 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup lowfat evap. milk (or you could use regular milk), and substituted 1/4 cup dry sherry for the wine.  Then I sprinkled garlic powder and fresh ground pepper (you don't need salt) directly over the chicken breasts, placed the ham and cheese on each piece and poured the sauce evenly over the top.  I recommend preparing the stuffing according to the package directions.  It turns out really good this way.  If you do use dry stuffing be sure to mix it with some melted butter and maybe a little water to moisten it up a bit.  They will still be firm but after baking they will soften up.  Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes, then remove foil and bake another 20 minutes.  I got a great result with these changes.  ",

Drain the noodles and lay them on a platter. Top with chicken breasts and ladle the sauce over the chicken. I either skip the stuffing or use the stovetop method to make it and serve along side.
