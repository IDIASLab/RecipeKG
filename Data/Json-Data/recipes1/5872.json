I cook the rice using vegetable broth and then add to it the cooked onion and garlic (I use double the garlic). I steam the broccoli and then add it to the rice onion and and garlic mix the cheese through it (I use about 1/2 cup more cheese than what is called for - I like it cheesy) and bake in the oven until the cheese is melted and then sprinkle the toasted walnuts on top. It's a great recipe I've shared it with several people who all think it's great.",

I used real brown rice instead of instant and olive oil instead of butter. I used low-fat cheese too and I don't think it affected the taste. I added extra broccoli because we love it and steamed it in the microwave for about 4 minutes before adding it to the rice onion cheese mixture. The major change I made was adding shelled toasted pumpkin seeds instead of walnuts. They seem to add just the right touch of crunch and salt to the recipe. Then I baked the whole thing at 350 for about 20 minutes. My kids love this too.",

Any recipe with brown rice I will try. I really liked it except I had to steam the broccoli with water or it shrivels up w/o it. I also put mine in a casserole dish and baked it in the 350 degree oven for 25 mins. and it was all gooey and good!! I also use low-fat cheese cause then its not as greasy. Thanks for this one!",

Then I added about 4 sm. cloves of garlic chopped small and cooked for about 1 min. more. Added instant brown rice and fried it for a couple of mins. in the mixture. Added 1 c. CHICKEN broth brought it up to a boil then covered it and turned it to super low and cooked it until all the liquid absorbed (10 mins?). Tossed in the frozen broccoli I had already steamed and about 1 c. finely shredded \"mexican style\" cheese (that's what I had in the fridge). I divided it in two servings (my hubby and I loved it THAT MUCH!) and topped it with the toasted walnuts. YUM! Oh we also had some baked salmon along with it. The salmon took a backseat to this wonderful rice dish. Thanks Candice!",

Next time I will use normal brown rice (not instant) and cook some brown lentils in with the rice when boiling with the stock. I love the combination of lentils onion and brown rice so I think it will make this recipe a 5 1/2 star one!!",
