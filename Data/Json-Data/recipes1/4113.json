The only change I make is to skip the garlic salt and add about 4 cloves of crushed garlic to the cheese sauce and increase the salt a bit.  I cook the pasta and the broccoli in the same pot/water at the same time.  While that's going on, I've got the cheese sauce in another pan and while it is baking, clean up goes quickly.\nVery glad to have found this winner of a recipe!",

I suggest adding more veggies to counter act the unhealthyness; corn peas carrots and cauliflower go well. Young kids would love it and its a great way to get them to eat vegetables if you load the dish with more than broccoli(sauce covers their taste pretty well). And to make it a full dinner add some chicken. I was out of swiss so i sprinkled just a little bit of cheddar and bread crumbs on top. If you put too much it will cover the flavor of the sauce which is cheesy enough so it only adds unnessicary calories. The bread crumbs dry it out. I suggest not baking it it only drys it out and heats up the kitchen. I give it a 4 and my mom gives it a 3. I don't think it makes the cut to make again.",
