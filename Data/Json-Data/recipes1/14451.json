I browned the meat and sauteed the veggies then threw everything in the crock pot on low for a couple of hours. When we came in from a cold day outside dinner was ready and it was wonderful. This recipe will go in my box of favorites. Four years later... This recipe is still one of my top ten. My poor recipe card is covered with scribbles. Thought I'd share them with you: DOUBLE THIS! Polish sausage (kielbasa) is better than smoked. Added cooked chicken thigh meat and leftover gravy...yummy. Do NOT use soaked dried beans without cooking first till tender. Tomatoes will inhibit cooking of beans. 1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar Doubled and used one can Ro-Tel tomatoes and one can regular...delicious Beans used so far: Kidney cannelini great northern navy black garbanzo lima",
