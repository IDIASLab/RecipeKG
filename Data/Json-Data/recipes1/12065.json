If you reserve the clam juice when draining, you can add back in enough to make a really wet batter/dough.  My can was a little bigger than called for, but the more clams the merrier! And you need more than 2T oil.  I used 1 1/2\" canola oil and fried small blobs, dropped in very quickly, until brown, then dried on a flat paper bag.  I did a test one first and found I needed to add more salt and also added a few generous shakes of Old Bay.  Finished product reminded me of when I was a kid in Rhode Island, going to Rocky Point with my family! Made for Western Region Allstars Faceless Frenzy July 2012",
