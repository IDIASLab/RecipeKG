One ingredient, pigeon pea, is Native to Africa and is also called 'Congo pea' and 'no-eyed pea'; achiote seeds are slightly musky-flavored seeds of the annatto tree, available whole or ground in East Indian, Spanish and Latin American markets. Buy whole seeds when they're a rusty red color; brown seeds are old and flavorless. Achiote seeds are also called 'annatto' which, in its paste and powder form, is used in the United States to color butter, margarine, cheese and smoked fish.",

You do not need to use so much oil I use from 1/4 to 1/2 cup only for 3 cups of rice. I also use long grain rice and green olives never black. A real plus to cutting down time for this is making up safrito (chopping in food processor onion green pepper garlic olive oil and cilantro and freezing them in ice cube trays - use one cube for every 1 and 1/2 cups of rice). I also sazon and tomato sauce about 1/4 cup.",
