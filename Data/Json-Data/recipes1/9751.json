I increased the ammount of cheese and I followed one reviewer's suggestion to only use 2/3 c. of mayo. The only problem was that there was not enough of the garlic mixture. We are garlic fiends! I would advise doubling that section of the recipe for more garlic deliciousness. I also added some oregano and pepper. For those of you wondering about the mayo this recipe does not produce mayo-flavored garlic bread. You can only taste the mozzarella and garlic. Once again a fantabulous recipe and this will be going in my recipe book. 15 college kids give this recipe a 4.0.",

I used my neighbors over to broil and cut up the pieces of bread. I doubled the recipe and there was not a SINGLE piece of bread left! All our friends were raving about this bread. The only change I made was that I caramelized the onions cooked for about 45 minutes and then I added the garlic for 4-5 minutes at the end. Let the mixture cool and then spread it on the bread and topped with the cheese/mayo mixture. Perfect!",

I will try this again for sure but cut the mayo in half because the overall taste again to us was mainly mayo. The onion/garlic mix that's spread on before the cheese mix is great. I chopped the onion very fine and added crushed garlic to the butter mix and simmered about 5 minutes at medium low heat. Do not brown the onion mixture. The onion and garlic almost dissolved and became a part of the butter once cooled and it really is a wonderful spread. I will use this recipe again but as written the mayo is very prominent.

They do not usually enjoy garlic bread but LOVED this one. Just a few changes: Used half the amount of butter added olive oil for the remainder eliminated onion (not a favorite of the kids) crushed whole cloves of garlic and sauteed them until golden then removed them. Oil/butter flavored nicely. (I put the garlic on my bread later yuuummmm! Just don't stand too close!) Had Monterey Jack in the fridge instead of Mozzarella worked very well. The cheese/mayo topping really makes this bread extra special. Way to go Holly! - - - Virginia",
