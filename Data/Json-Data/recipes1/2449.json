My biggest problem with it is that there was too much semi-sweet chocolate flavor and not enough hazelnut. If I make it again i will not put the chocolate chips in the crust like it calls for. Something else I was annoyed with was the amount of work I had to put into it (and normally I love a challenge). Just make sure you have a food processor or blender before you start (as a college student I don't have either of those luxeries so I had to crush all of the chocolate chips by hand which was redundant). Well i focused so much on the negatives that i don't want to leave out any other positives. The cheesecake itself is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous when it is all done. However instead of dipping hazelnuts into chocolate for the topping i simply put the chocolate/sourcream mixtre on top of the cake and then sprinkled it with toasted hazelnuts. The taste was outstanding and the texture was great. Overall I was very pleased...I will keep this one in mind for the future.",

Check out the picture it turned out great. I more than doubled the recipe and made one 9\" and one 10\". The crust was a liitle tough to get to stick up the sides of the pan but with a little work I got it to stick. After it was cooked it stayed up fine. I made this for an auction for the Young women's program at church. I'll let you know how much it went for.(I kept the 10\" for my Dad's birthday party).",

I'm giving it a 5 because of the fairly easy preparation (okay the crust was time consuming and I didn't dip the hazelnuts in chocolate for the top) the great presentation (this looks fabulous and expensive) and the delicious flavor. BUT I must admit it didn't quite taste the rich hazelnutty way I expected. I crumbled a chocolate hazelnut bar on the top and when I tasted a piece of the bar I realized that was the flavor I was hoping for (like Nutella) but the hazelnut liqueur just wasn't able to give it that flavor. Next time I might spread Nutella across it the top instead of the chocolate/hazelnut liqueur mixture. All that said I still think this is a fantastic cheesecake and it is definitely worth trying if this is your first attempt at cheesecake!",
