It was yummy, and my two daughters who are the biggest fuss budgets in the world said it was the best meal they had eaten in a long while",

I also made your recipe for Tzaziki sauce to go on top of it! By the way I had to tweak the spice down because my dad can't handle hot food. If you can't handle those spicy chili powders that he adds just use plain chili powder only. I also increased the cumin and oregano just a touch to counteract the other missing chili powder flavors. I also used beef broth instead of the water as well. That was just my preference is all. Enjoy guys this is something you'll never regret making. People at my culinary school would love to eat this.",

I can tell just by seeing the essential ingredients! Note for others: The corn chips need to be ground to replace otherwise available corn \"masa\" (or wheat flour roux in AZ) The tomatoes are okay even trace amounts in Green Chile but I'd experiment reducing that. I concur with one cook who added more cumin and I'd make sure I used plenty of black pepper. Of course even though it would drastically change the outcome this AZ guy'd add lots of chunked green chiles i.e. roasted & peeled green New Mexicos or Poblanos! Maybe we could experiment w/ canned red or green enchilada sauce too. However even I would make this recipe as written by John first to get a good baseline - and to enjoy it!",
