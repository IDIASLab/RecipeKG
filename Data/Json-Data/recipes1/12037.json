Here's some things I changed that I think enhanced the recipe: I added a little extra flour (between 1/4 - 1/2 cup total), less sugar (used only one cup and will next time probably use 2/3 - 3/4 cup only), and added a dash of cinamon, nutmeg, allspice, clove, altogether totalling about a heaping half teaspoon. The result was pretty good, and I will use this recipe again, only with less sugar :) Thank you for the base recipe!",

So, it was a big hit! I did use some of the comments made by other users. My mulberries were very juicy, so I added extra flour, and I also added a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and allspice as suggested by Pixilix. I also reduced the amount of sugar to 2/3 cup, however I think I would prefer it just a little bit sweeter, so will up the amount to 3/4 cup of sugar next time. I also used a tart pastry crust using flour, butter and egg yolk, which came out just wonderfully -- tasty and flaky, and beautifully golden brown -- and brushed the top of the crust with milk and sprinkled it with raw cane sugar. Tasty and pretty! I will definitely be making this pie again! :o)",
