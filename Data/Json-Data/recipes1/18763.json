I add some fresh spinach I usually have around about 1 cup chopped, and butter one layer, light butter spray the next.  And instead of spreading 1/5 of the spinach mixture along one short side of phyllo stack and fold in long sides of phyllo, I do the opposite.  I put the mixture on the long side fold in the short side, less dough more spinach in each bite.  You can't lose anyway you make this recipe.",
