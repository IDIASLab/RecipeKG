Usually I buy the mix at the store and make that, but this is so much better. I served it with enchiladas and rice and beans, and it was a big hit. \n\nFor the masa harina, I read the other reviewer state that what this is, is corn flour. So instead of going out and buying this ingredient, I took cornmeal and ground it up to a flour like texture in the food processor. And it worked perfect. I highly reccomend this recipe. \n\nI think the reviewer that stated it was too buttery, and too gooey, expected it to be corn pudding, or something else. This is not that. If it is what you are expecting, the sweet corn cake like served in popular mexican restarants, you won't be disapointed.\n\nI will make this every time I make mexican food!  Thanks!",

The Native Americans originally would use ashes from their hardwood fires to the corn flour/meal originally.  Lack of knowledge of this to the Europeans that brought maize back with them caused many to die or suffer Mal-absorption issues.  I hope this clears up any confusion of the difference between the Mas Harina and Corn flour.",

I also used splenda instead of sugar.  Total comfort food...corny carby goodness.
