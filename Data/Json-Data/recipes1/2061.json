Of course the dough could be better with more time and more steps (and it is, I've taken the time).  But the recipe, as is, deserves the full 5 stars.  You will never make pizza dough better than this with this little effort put forth.  Thanks for the FABULOUS recipe.  We will never order out again.",

Mix water, yeast, sugar & oil in mixer bowl.  Then add flour & salt.  Mix-knead for 10-12 minutes, sprinkling with flour to keep from sticking to bowl.  Dough should be elastic & smooth. Place dough in oiled bowl, cover dough with oil, cover & let stand 1 hr at room temp. Then divide dough 2 equal parts roll into balls, cover with damp towel & let stand another 10 mins.  Use immediately.  Don't forget to poke holes into dough with fork once rolled onto pan to let steam escape while baking.",

It is a no-fail go-to recipe for pizza crust when you dont WANT to wait for dough to rise, or have to pull out fifty-three different ingredients.  By all means, personalize it to your heart's content, but also don't be afraid to make it as is.  I also use it for quick breadsticks: roll it out and cut into strips with a pizza cutter, bake as directed, then brush with butter that has been melted with minced fresh garlic and sprinkle them with grated parmesan.  yum!",

There is quite a big difference in the final result depending on how you add the yeast. You'll get a thin & crispy result if you add the yeast to the warm water first and a thicker bready base if the water is added to all the dry ingredients at the same time. I used olive oil and  also added lots of dried herbs to the dry mix. This recipe also makes a really good garlic bread if you top it with olive oil, crushed garlic and parmesan cheese. I doesn't seem necessary to let the dough rise first, I didn't really notice any difference. Maybe our yeast is a bit different in NZ!",

If thats what your going for, fine, but you dont need the yeast.\r\n\r\nTo make a proper crust, proof the yeast, sugar and water for 10-15 mins, then add the rest of the ingedients.\r\n\r\nThe recipe is very bland by itself, you need, at the very least, more salt.  I just used Adobo (about a tablespoon) and addes some garlic powder and onion powder.  Not enough to over power, but enough to take away the blandness.  I've also found adding 2 tablespoons of honey, in addition to the sugar, helps a lot.\r\n\r\nAlso, once you form the dough, let it sit so it can rise, maybe 10-15 mins, then roll it out.",

And make sure the water really is warm... when I was learning how to cook I didn't necessarily pay attention to that part. Using warm (rather than cool) water makes a difference. UPDATE 2/14/11: I have made this many times over the last few years. I do everything I did above plus I've tweaked a bit. I heat the oven to 400 and bake just the crust for about 12 minutes before adding the toppings and baking for another 15. I also sometimes brush the crust and edge with olive oil for a slightly more \"golden\" effect. I find that these changes do not take away from the simplicity and greatness of this recipe nor do they add hardly any time to preparing. I'm also updating my 4 stars to 5 because I've gotten the hang of this crust and it really is fantastic!",

Also, I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil [just a preference].  My husband likes a medium thickness to his crust and I like a thinner [flat bread] crust, which this recipe accomplished.  I brushed a little olive oil on the shells I made and prebaked them at 425 degrees for 5 minutes and froze them.  No need to thaw when you are ready to use, just put on the toppings and bake.  I baked at 425 degrees, just perfect.  Depending on the size of the pizza shells you are making, you can  get several shells from this recipe.  Thank you.",
