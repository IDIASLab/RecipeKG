I baked mine in a round 8 or 9 inch baking pan for 35 minutes. Put a tooth pick in and it came out clean. When I cut it there was still some raw dough in the center. I put it back in the oven but it wasn't quite right, of course. The top was getting brown so if I make this again I will put some foil on top to try for a better result.   I gently scooped the flour into the measuring cup as I always do with baked goods. The result for me was that the cake texture was soft and tender. Less dense than a pound cake but more dense than a white or yellow cake.   I also found this cake to be a little too sweet for my preferences. Next time I'll withhold some sugar. I even put a tablespoon of lemon juice in because I had no zest. So I found it particularly too sweet. I also found it to be a bit too oily. I wish I'd subbed half a cup of apple sauce. I think with some fiddling this could be a very good recipe. I also think it could make a delicious sweet bread if pecans were added and it was baked in the loaf pan as directed. I may try this again at Christmas time and see what comes of it.",
