I tried to make this from memory having looked at the recipe this morning. After making it and not remembering how long I was supposed to bake it I reviewed the recipe to find that I had left out the sour cream. I also had divided the batter in 1/2 and added the chocolate to one portion. I made a gluten free crust using Rice Chex cocoa powder sugar and butter. That actually turned out quite well held together wonderfully and everyone really liked it. I had a hard time swirling the batters probably because I had the same amount of both so it turned out more like a layered chocolate vanilla cheesecake. Overall no one cared about the looks and it was a wonderful dessert tonight topped with whipped cream and chocolate syrup!",
