I used 16 slices of bread, deli sliced ham, and sliced cheese instead of shredded.  I used 8 eggs, 3 cups of milk, 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder, 2 teaspoons of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  I increased the cornflakes to 5 cups (crushed well) and 1/2 cup of melted margarine.  I then layered in the following order bread, ham, cheese, ham, cheese, bread.  I found that if you layer the ham and cheese it\u2019s more evenly distributed.  I poured the egg mixture over, then cornflakes and baked at 350 for one hour.  Awesome!",

All I do is brown them on the stove before Mixing them with the rest of the ingredients to bake. While they are browning, I like to spice them up with salt,pepper, ground mustard,onion powered and a touch of hot sauce. Add the hashbrowns to the dish first then pour your eggs on top. Then add whatever meat you'd like and top with cheese! Works out a little better than bread because it's not so soft..it's more of a hearty breakfast taste with more flavor!",
