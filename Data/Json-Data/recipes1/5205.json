I think it would make an interesting combination.  Also, if anyone is wondering I don't see why you can't use jarred sauce to save time.  I made the sauce as directed.  It was good, but nothing spectacular.",

The sauce itself-I used 2 cans diced tomatoes and two huge cans of crushed tomatoes-that's all I had on hand. I sauteed the onion and garlic in 3 tbs olive oil on low heat for 10 minutes and added in fresh basil and parsley from my garden. I then poured in all the sauce and added salt pepper and a handful of parmesan cheese. After that simmered for 2 hours-I cooked the ravioli and gently mixed in some sauce. I spread sauce on bottom of pan and did ravioli parmesan cheese mozz cheese more ravioli sauce parmesan cheese and mozz cheese as my layers. I baked covered for 30 minutes and removed cover for last 10 minutes to get a nice top. My husband thought it was a cool idea to make a ravioli lasagna!",

My husband has requested I make this marinara sauce for all future pasta dishes so I jarred up a big batch. He prefers the sauce with meat in it. My 7-year-old stepdaughter got to help make the sauce after asking me if chopping onions really makes people cry! A very easy recipe that makes the house smell heavenly. I use little or no water but my leftovers are a little dry; next time I'll go ahead and add all the water.",

For the amount of ravioli listed in the recipe I used nearly two 28 ounce jars of organic store bought pasta sauce instead of making the sauce in the recipe.  I also used 3 cups of a four cheese blend (including asiago, provolone, mozzarella and parmesan).  I mixed the cooked ravioli with the sauce in a large bowl first before placing everything into the baking pan (I wanted the ravioli thoroughly coated with sauce).  I poured half of the ravioli mixture into the baking pan and sprinkled on about 1 cup of cheese then topped with remaining ravioli and cheese.  This recipe makes alot - I used a 15x10 inch pyrex baking pan.  Great dish to serve on a cold winter day!",
