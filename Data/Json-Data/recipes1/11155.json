The only thing I did different was toss everything in the crock pot for 6 hours on high instead of baking. Meat was very tender and easy to shred. I'm only giving it three stars because I guess I was looking for more of a barbeque flavor but maybe I am just used to bottled barbeque sauce. I served this with warmed flour tortillas and shredded cheddar cheese and husband enjoyed it this way. He is used to eating shredded pork bbq on rolls and he liked the change. I do think its funny that the first person to review this recipe seems like it is the author of the recipe herself either that or its just a coincidence.;)",
