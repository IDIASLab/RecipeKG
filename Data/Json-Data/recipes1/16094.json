I also substituted 1 tbsp. sweet chile sauce for the cayenne and serrano peppers which probably toned it down a little (I have four little eaters). It made a delicious marinade for the chicken and an excellent dressing. I will never buy peanut sauce again!",

I make zero alterations to the ingredients other than a few time-saving tips: (1) I use rotisserie chicken to save myself cooking the chicken breasts. Bonus: a chicken carcass to cook down for broth later! (2) I use all-natural peanut butter (with no sugar added) because I don't care for the added sweetness and prefer the more pure peanut flavor. (3) I dice everything in bite-sized pieces so you can get a little bit of everything in one bite. I have used fresh jalape\u00f1os in place of serranos in a pinch because we grow our own, and they are always on hand. Toasting the spelt is absolutely essential for a yummy nutty flavor. This is one of those recipes that just gets better and better with time...but it can also get spicier and spicier with time, so watch your cayenne if you're not a lover of the burn. Love this recipe; it's perfect as-is, and thank you so much for it. It's an absolute favorite!",
