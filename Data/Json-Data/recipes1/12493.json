I froze mine for about 18 hours, and it spilled all over my freezer.  When I checked on it after about eight or ten hours, it looked fine, though.  I let it thaw for about three hours, which wasn't quite long enough.  Four to five hours would probably be about right.  If you're only freezing it for eight hours, two hours for thawing is probably correct.  Basically, use a much larger container and add an hour or two onto the thawing time if you're going to freeze it for more than just overnight.",
