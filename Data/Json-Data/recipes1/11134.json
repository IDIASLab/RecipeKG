To make it easier I boil the noodles (break them up into pieces about 1 inch in length before cooking), drain and put them back in the hot pot with 1/4 c. butter (I cut back from the noted 1/2 c.) and stir till the butter is melted and has coated all the noodles. Then I turn the noodles into the baking pan. I mix the ricotta (which is 1 cup) with the sugar, eggs and vanilla till mixed well then add the milk and cream. I do not use the anise. Pour the liquid over the noodles and bake. I always have some liquid left. The pan is filled to the top making it impossible to fill on the counter and carry to the oven so fill the pan (use a sturdy pan) enough then place in oven on rack and finish filling there.

I don't care for the anise and I doubt that my mother has ever used it as well because this recipe taste just like she used to make minus the anise. It brought back many tears and great memories the first time I duplicated this recipe. THANK YOU!",
