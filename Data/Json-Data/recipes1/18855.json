One pound of crabmeat certainly isn't necessary for two people, however, and almost seemed like a misprint, so use only as much as what appeals to you. He used very small filets, about 4 oz. each, wrapped them in bacon and seasoned them with Worcerstershire sauce and Montreal Steak Seasoning. He used the meat from Alaskan King Crab legs, tossing them with plenty of hot, clarified butter. If you like your steak cooked medium to medium-well as I do, you'll want to cook them a few minutes longer than the recipe directs. After Hubs was done with these?...five star good.",
