We used devil's food cake mix and neopolitian ice cream - they were a little messy but they were yummy!",

I copied Trisha's picture and rolled the edges in sprinkles....very cute! A tip that made the cookies more uniform and not too thick......I spooned out the batter onto the cookie sheet and flattened with the back of the spoon into a circle. Then with fingers dampened with water I was able to smooth out the surface of the cookies (the dough is very sticky thus the damp fingers!). Without this bit of smoothing out the cookies were kind of lumpy and bumpy. I will make these again the kids and grownups both enjoyed them.",
