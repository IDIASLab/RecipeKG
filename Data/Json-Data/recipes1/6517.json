I added two cloves of garlic and a chopped shallot to the sauce and a bit more onion (red) than called for. To make it healthier (and because I do not like very rich sauces on my pasta) I used half-n-half in place of the heavy cream and Smart Balance Light margarine instead of butter. I did not add any additional salt. I was worried that it would be too salty but after adding the tomatoes (on the advice of other reviewers added in the last few minutes of making the sauce) and mixing with the pasta the saltiness was fine. Will definitely make again! Also I doubled the sauce except for the salmon (chopped up 4 oz which was a lot) and it ended up being WAY more than just two of us needed. If you are making it for 2-3 people and are eating normal-sized portions I would not double the sauce.",
