It is very important to use real butter and use ground beef that is not too lean (the fat adds flavor!) Seriously everyone we all give in to ice cream and cake occasionally so why not OCCASIONALLY give in to the yumminess of fatty meat and cheese. Don't forget to have a vegetable though and by that I mean french fries of course. Who wants to live forever anyway if you aren't enjoying life? and it's not heroin - it's food.
