The recipe calls for 2 tsp.of garlic crushed(not 2 cloves).This could be why everyone says to double up on garlic because they are counting cloves instead of teaspoons of garlic. I used 7 BIG cloves of garlic and upped the oil 1/4c and bread crumbs, Cheese combo 1/4c for 6 breast. Baked for 30 min. Per--fect. This is not fried/baked chicken. This is a Exquisite dish and the aroma is Heavenly. IF there are left over,place on a salad for a nice lunch.  Encore",

If you are looking for a strong garlic taste this is not it.  However, since I was cooking for a one year old and a picky husband the taste was perfect.  \r\nThe recipe is super fast, taking only a few minutes to warm the oil and roll the chicken in the coating.  \r\nThe only thing I did wrong was using chicken breast tenders rather than chicken breasts.  I don't recommend this.  You have to decrease the cooking time to prevent the chicken from drying out and the coating does not get crispy.  The chicken was just starting to get crispy when I had to remove it from the oven.  I think it would have been even better if I had been able to cook it at least another 15 minutes.  \r\nI will make it again using whole chicken breasts in the future.",

I changed this: I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs because they are RELIABLY more moist then breasts (always trim off any extra fat with kitchen sheers). I ran the garlic and olive oil through my mini-blender so it was like a smooth garlic emulsion oil (I did warm the oil in the microwave as suggested).  I tossed 1/2 the chicken into a ziplock, poured in the garlic oil....tossed in the other half of the chicken and closed the bag.  I hand squished the garlic oil all throughout the chicken by kneading the bag. That saves the messy step of hand dipping each piece into the oil and then into the crumbs.  I used Italian bread crumbs with the grated cheese and coated the pieces as suggested.  It was excellent!!.  It really was very easy, tasty and light!! Baked 400\u00b0 for 23 minutes.",
