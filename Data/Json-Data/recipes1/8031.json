                "reviewBody": "I just made this bread without a bread machine.  Here is how I did it.  1/3 warm water (around 100 F) add sugar and yeast.  Stir and let it sit for a few minutes until it starts to foam.  Add the milk and an egg, whisk together.  In a large bowl mix the salt and 1 cup of the flour. Mix in the liquid to the flour.  Slowly add the rest of the flour until you can work with the dough with your hands.  Kneed the bread with your hands for 8-10 minutes adding flour as needed.  The dough should be smooth.  Place the dough back in the bowl and cover it with a towel so the dough can rest.  Many times my kitchen is cool so I run the microwave for 15 sec (with nothing in it) and then I put the bowl in there so the dough can rise in a warm place.  Let the dough rise until it has doubled in size which is about 2 hours.  Spray a bread pan with cooking spray.  Form the dough into a smooth log and place in the pan.  Cover again with a towel so it will rise a second time, about 45-60 minutes.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 30-35 minutes.  A good way to tell if bread is ready to come out is to knock on the bread and if it sounds hollow it is ready!  I was looking for a nice chewy bread and this is great.  I was getting tired of crumbly bread that would get everywhere when I sliced it.  I plan on serving this to my husband for breakfast.  I can\u2019t wait! So much so that there is already a piece missing, well I had to tell you all how it turned out, duh!",
