I did use milk instead of water and added 2 Tbsp corn syrup to thicken it a bit.  I can put this recipe in the fridge and without having to heat it up when I take it out, I can pour it on anything I want.\r\nI put the sauce in little jars, and will hand them out at my chocolate tasting party this weekend.
