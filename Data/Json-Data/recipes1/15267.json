I crushed Werther's Originals and sprinkled them on the chocolate covered spoons I had made. OUTSTANDING! I thought it would be easy to cover the spoons but found that first I had to covered the back with chocolate let that harden; then fill the spoon with chocolate and let that harden. For some reason I thought I would be able to \"dip and go\". Once I filled the front with chocolate I sprinkled on the Werther's Originals. (I crushed them till they were almost powder like so they melt nice in the coffee). To let them \"dry\" I happened to have a box sitting on the table so I slid the handle of the spoon under the flap of the box. This way the chocolate didn't get smashed. They looked very nice.",
