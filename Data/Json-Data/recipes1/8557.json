After looking at the recipe I thought this was a good base, but sounded as thought it might be a bit on the bland side. Sooo..I made a few changes. First I added some garlic. I use the pre minced garlic in the jar so I added about 1 to 1-1/2 teaspoons. I also chopped up a green bell pepper and added it to the mix along with a can of chopped tomatoes with green chilis (rotell tomatoes)to give it a little extra bite. Also in addition to cooking the soup with a ham bone, verses a ham hock, I also cubed up a good amount of left over ham and added it into the soup at the end. The result was yummy and would make again!!",

I also added a can of 'diced tomatoes with chiles' for color and extra flavor. Couldn't find any smoked cheddar cheese but regular sharp cheddar worked just fine. I served it with hot corn bread muffins and a tossed salad. Great meal!!!",

This is hearty and I'd say the recipe makes enough for at least 6 people to have as a main dish. I might use ham shanks instead of ham hocks b/c they have more meat. As left overs I added some fried bratwurst and a dijon style mustard and it was great.",
