I added one chopped carrot some garlic salt a bay leaf and some thyme to the water/bouillon mix (used the water I had boiled the chicken in). I also used whole wheat flour because and brown rice because it's what I had. If using brown rice your cook time is going to increase by about 30 minutes and you're going to want at least another cup of water. It was DELICIOUS! My 5 and 12 year old had 2 bowls! Not a bite was left definitely going to double the recipe next time!",

I do modify it by cooking 3 large carrots first until done and then I also add a can of baby peas. This is put in after the chicken and extra milk. It really adds another layer of flavor to the entire meal. By adding the extra carrots and peas I do have to add a little more milk to thin it down a little more. Still fabulous!!!!!! Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!",

I added 1/4 cup chopped carrots at the beginning used 4 chicken bullion cubes and 1/2 tsp salt. At the end to get the consistency that we enjoy used 2 cups of milk instead of just one and sprinkled some dry parsley flakes overall. This soup DOES need something to spice it up a little more but I'm not quite sure what. Overall easy and tasty soup...as it was completed in about 25 minutes! Thanks Nell.",

That still didn't do it though improved it. In the end I added a bit of salt to my bowl and that seemed to add just one extra kick it still needed. Considering the blandness I don't see where all that butter added flavor but a lot of fat so if I had it to do over I think I'd also cut the butter back and add some more bouillon. Only reason I didn't rate it lower is cause it's a good basis but definitely needs some work and I happen to like how thick it was. Update: Made this again later adding 3 t. poultry seasoning a hair of salt cut the butter in half & added another bouillon cube. This made a pretty good cream soup.",
