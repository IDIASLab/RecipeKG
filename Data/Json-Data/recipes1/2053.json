A nice quick simple recipe with healthy ingredients.  Out of the oven the muffin I tasted was eager to fall apart.  However, I placed them in the refrigerator over night and then heated in the microwave the next morning and had a perfectly firm moist muffin.  I was a little hesitant to put in the 1 TBSP of baking powder but was very pleased to find no taste of it in the end.  And we all loved them.  Keeping this recipe because it has great taste and nutritional value.",

I like this recipe alot because of the high propotion of heart-healthy/good carb oatmeal and the low amount of oil (as opposed to magerine). I made some modifications - i added some shakes of cinnamon and some vanilla extract. I substituted orange juice for the milk (i wanted to keep them non-dairy and i did not have soy-milk on hand). I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup (i might not do that next time...) and i added a stuesel topping - a mixture of oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and earth's balance light margerine (i was pretty surprised the light margerine held the struesel together and kept it crunchy!) i baked it at 400 for about 20-22 minutes. I like the batter of this muffin recipe - i see myself using it to also make strwberry muffins, apple muffins, or just plain coffee cake muffins (no fruit inside - and alot of brown-sugar struesel topping! Spectacular.  UPDATE: I substituted chopped apples for the blueberries - and they came out great!!! I tossed the apples with some lemon juice and a bit of sugar and cinnamon. I topped each muffin with a cinnamon-oatmeal struesal made from a mixture of oats, flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and some low fat margerine. I baked my first batch at 400 -but the struesel started to get too dark quickly, so I baked my second batch at 350 - and increased the baking time by 5 minutes. They came out great and they freeze really ",

That's just what these are.  These are good and oaty, and just sweet enough.  Like a comforting bowl of oatmeal topped with a little sugar and fresh blueberries.  Other than adding 1/2 tsp. of vanilla I followed the recipe with no changes.  What I found confusing is that with a tablespoon of baking powder and the high heat, that these didn't rise or dome quite as I had expected.  Maybe there was too MUCH baking powder!  No matter, this little muffin is just so pleasant I couldn't bring myself to docking it a star for that. Nice, homey, old-fashioned MUFFIN.",

I've made several batches of this recipe with slight tweaks -- dried fruit in lieu of fresh blueberries soy instead of dairy milk egg replacer instead of egg -- always with great results. Try adding lots of cinnamon (I add about a tbsp.) to the batter and sprinkle the tops with a few extra rolled oats and a bit of turbinado raw sugar before baking! As others have mentioned it seems 20-25 minutes at 400 F works well.",
