Unsolicited my 20yo said \"This sauce is incredibly good and spicy.\" Well said I think. Thanks for the recipe!:) UPDATE: I don't make a lot of recipes more than once because I'm an adventurer but I have visited this recipe a few times since I first made it. I made it again tonight for fish katsu and was out of garlic powder so I used fresh - still excellent. I've also used this sauce on steamed shrimp - makes an awesome cocktail sauce. Thanks again!",

Measuring to taste: I added a few teaspoons of shoyu (soy sauce), 1-2 teaspoon of sugar, and about 1-2 tablespoons of applesauce. I cut down on the ketchup, about 1/2 cup and added more Worcestershire, about 1/4 cup or less. Over all, the sauce came to 1 cup for me. But the applesauce is important. Why? Because a lot of bottled tonkatsu sauces have fruit in it, like apple, dates, etc. Now, for a hint of spice, I add a light sprinkle of cinnamon. I used yours as a basis, but being that I eyeballed the rest, I can't really post up my own version. :) Remember, really good tonkatsu has some apple in it!",
