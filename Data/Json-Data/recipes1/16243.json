The dough crept up my hand mixer and almost ruined it.  Mix by hand after the first 4-5 cups of flour.  And like all allrecipe users, I changed the recipe.  I used 2 cups of potato water, since it was already hot, Added 2 tsp of vanilla to the dough, and used half brown half white sugar and added a pinch of cloves to the filling.    Definitely double the icing recipe.  (Next time I'm going to add orange zest)  Thank you for the recipe from a fellow Iowan!  :)",

                "reviewBody": "This has become my favorite recipe out of the many ones I've tried and they are a must for my bake sales. The Potatoes break up the gluten in the flour making the dough tender and melt in your mouth, so you don't have to worry about fussing with it so much. Its easy for first timers just don't over work your dough and it will stay tender. (Personally stickier the better!)  I usually make up my own \"brown\" sugar for the filling its cheaper just to add a tsp of molasses per cup of white sugar.  I also add some nutmeg to the dough for a nutty touch. A tip for even rising/baking I always slice them no more than 1 1/2 \" thick with a long piece of floss (slide under and cross them over) and then gently smash them down in the pan so they are spread out evenly. That way they don't bake so lop sided. or one edge rises higher and burns.",

This was also my first time ever attempting to make cinnamon rolls, and they were very easy to make.   One thing that I should mention though.  If you are using a standard size Kitchen Aid mixer, after you add all of the flour, your mixer will have trouble kneading the dough.  I kneaded it on my counter a few times, divided it in half, and proceeded to knead just one half of the dough at a time in the mixer.  Worked out great because then I just let the dough rise separated and didn't have to divide it later.  Awesome recipe!!  I wouldn't change a thing!!",
