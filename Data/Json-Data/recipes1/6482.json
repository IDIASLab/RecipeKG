I followed the recipe exactly except that I only added 1 cup of ketchup as per other reviewers suggestions and than I added a 1/4 cup of Bull's Eye bbq sauce because I was worried it would taste to \"ketchup tasting\" as other reviewers said. The intersting thing about this recipe is that is tastes awesome and you would never be able to tell what it is that tastes so interesting.  I had my husband brush this on chicken wings that we grilled and they reminded me of the wonderful taste of duck when they serve it with a fruit glaze/sauce.  I used  seedless blackberry preserves.  We are having a bbq on JLu 4th and are planning on serving this!  I can't wait to see peoples reactions when they ask what is in it.  Thank you for a delicious recipe!  Try it...you will not be disappointed.  It is NOT too sweet......just YUMMY!",

IF YOU PREFER A HOTTER SAUCE ADD A COUPLE OF DASHES OF EITHER TABASCO SAUCE OR THAI HOT CHILE SAUCE OR CHILPOTLE HOT SAUCE.
