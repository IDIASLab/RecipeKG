An expert cook may know this but a novice may not. I started this recipe at 8am INCLUDING an added 1/2c beef broth (using 1/2c water and 1 tsp beef boullion) and turned my crockpot on low.  Around noonish - I checked it and it was looking pretty dry.  In my haste - I added (apprx) another cup of water - I literally filled a drinking cup with water and poured/stirred it in - so I'm guessing it was close to a cup measurement.  It was still awesome and your house smells delicious. Other than the liquid addition (and going reduced sodium but not reduced fat soups) I didn't change a thing. A very easy \"winter\" dish to make!",

Althought others have suggested adding some form of liquid to the meat there is no need to do so.  As long as you cook on low your meat will come out perfectly tender 6 to 8 hours later.  I have cooked smaller roasts for slightly less time, and much larger roasts for a few hours longer, adding an extra can of soup or the larger roasts.  The only change we make is that we don't pour the mixture in then coat the meat with it.  We do as follows: 1. Line baking dish with aluminum foil (make it lon enough to wrap around the meat) or one of those reynolds oven bags  2. place the meat in the baking dish  3. spread the cream of mushroom soup over the top of the meat and down the sides  4. sprinkle onion soup mix over top  5.  add veggies around meat  6. wrap and tent the meat with the aluminum foil or close the oven bag  7. Cook at 275 for 6 to 8 hours  ENJOY!!!!  If done correctly the meat comes out so tender it melts in your mouth and it makes its own gravy.  My brother and I called this stringy meat when we were little because it literally falls apart and almost looks stringy.",

Line a small roast pan with foli ( enough to cover everything) add your meat, potatoes, carrots along side of meat. Mix onion soup with cream of mushroom soup and pour over everything, In the morning before I go to work I pop it into a 275 degree oven and slow cook for 6-8 hour. When I get home from work, make a few rolls and your meal is ready. Perfect gravy, perfect meat & veggies. Simple and easy.  Great to make a beef pot pie with any leftovers, just slice everything and add to pastry.Bake at 400 for 20-30 minutes.",

The solution is to toss the veggies in a little olive olive with herbs and fresh garlic. Put them in a foil package on top of the beef. This prevents them from becoming soft which would normally happen if they soaked in the juices from the beef. In other words, perfect roast and veggies!",
