I can't imagine an 8 oz can would have been enough. I cooked for the length instructed but the noodles were still a little tough. The taste was great and the sauce was very rich and full of flavor. I will definitely make this again but try cooking the noodles first. I have to add that this lasagna was 100 times better heated up the next day. The sauce was tastier and the noodles more tender.",

                "reviewBody": "Overall this recipe is very simple to make and pretty tasty. I changed the recipe slightly to substitute store boughten pasta sauce for the first four ingredients because I prefer the flavor. (For example I chose a spicy roasted red pepper sauce to make mine more flavorful.) I also made the slight addition to include cooked carrots in with the spinach ricotta mixture. Overall my only complaint was that it was not quite cheesy enough. I wish the cheese to noodle ratio was a little bit higher. Granted I understand why the ratio is the way it is since ricotta comes in a pint size. However when I make it in the future I will probably add more fresh mozzarella cheese or perhaps some romano to make it four cheese lasagna. However overall it is a great simple recipe. It's also very easy to add in other veggies you like such as carrots zucchini bell peppers etc. But if you're a cheese lover like me I would add in more cheese to make it even yummier.",

I substituted a jar of spaghetti sauce w/ mushrooms since I wanted a few mushrooms and was too lazy to make my own sauce; I also added half a cup of romano and extra parmesan since I crave cheesiness; and I added some basil oregano and parsley since it seemed appropriate. Just a great lasagna and quick to make on top of that. Definitely making again when I need a lot of food and don't have a lot of time.",
