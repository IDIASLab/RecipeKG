I also found the potato to egg ratio to be too high.  It seemed like mostly potatoes with a little egg around them.  I'd half the potatoes if I made it again.  It needs salt and pepper for seasoning.  And I'd put the cheese throughout for even flavor, not just on top.  The whole thing was kind of bland except for the sausagey bites, but it's a good base to start from if you tweak it a bit.",

The mushroom soup sounded wierd, but it worked!  I did one layer of tater tots, one layer of crumbled sausage, one layer of sauteed fresh mushrooms, red peppers and onions, and one layer of pepper jack and cheddar cheese; added some salt and green Tabasco to the egg mixture and poured all over the top of the casserole.  A sprinkling of paprika for color and it was a beautiful as well as tasty dish.  I've made this several times now -- great make-ahead meal!  It will take longer to cook than the recipe says -- about 1 to 1.5 hours to properly set up.",

I sauteed green peppers and onions with FRESH mushrooms before adding them to the cooked sausage. Instead of regular cream of mushroom soup I used cream of mushroom with garlic soup to add a little flavor. I also added a half cup of cheese to the egg mixture and increased the amount of cheese sprinkled on top. With these alterations it was an EXCELLENT dish. I got so many compliments and will make this again and again.",
