Put about a tablespoon of butter in each have and spread it around on the top edges and inside.  Litely sprinkle nutmeg all over and then about twice as much cinnamon.  Follow it up with brown sugar (1-2T each half depending on how sweet you like it) and bake at 350 for about 20 minutes.  Feel free to turn the oven off and keep the squash in there until the rest of your meal is done.  You just can't miss with squash this way!",

I use the same amount and same ingredients, but I cut the acorn squash in half, place flesh side up and place into a casserole dish or a roasting pan with a little water. I put the butter and brown sugar in the middle before I cook it. Then I cook in a 350 degree oven for 45-60 mins. Comes out perfect every time. If the squah is a little unstable, I cut the bottom just a little to make it stand up better. I'll do about 2 squash at a time (4 servings).",

To get the flavor into the squash, you have to cut through the flesh with a knife in a criss-cross pattern to allow entry to the butter and sugar. Also, DO NOT replace the top half onto the bottom half for baking. That's crazy! That top half will get no flavor! Bake all halves flesh facing up with their own portion of butter and sugar.",

Never bothered to do it any other way, mostly because I'm just not a fan of mixing sweet with savory. This year however, I thought I'd like to try something different, and was willing to try the sugar on squash concept. So, other than putting a little water in the pan during the first half hour, I made this exactly as written and... I'm a convert!  Loved it, as did everyone else at the Thanksgiving table. The combination of brown sugar and butter baked to create almost a caramely glaze which was just pleasantly sweet. Simply delicious!",
