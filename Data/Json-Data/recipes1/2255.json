The cake-like texture disappeared because it was just too butter saturated, making it heavy and very dense. Too much broccoli-can taste it very prominently, so that nice cornbread taste was completely overshadowed by it. Cottage cheese-why? It only left its white specks in the batter, making it look like little clumps of unmixed flour. ",

Instead of onions, I sauteed fresh shallots and fresh garlic in a small amount of margarine.  It was wonderful!  Thanks for sharing this terrific recipe.",
