There are a few changes I make: For one, I add a little more brown sugar to the marinade (I don't measure, I just throw it in). Next, it's best if you marinate it overnight (I do in a large ziplock bag). Then you MUST grill it (It tastes so much better this way).  Finally, the best part: Serve it with the following sauce: Mustard Scallion Sauce: 1/2 C. sour cream, 1/2 Cup mayo, 1 Tbsp. dry mustard, 3 Tbsp chopped scallions, 1 1/2 Tbsp. white vinegar, and 1 1/2 tsp. sugar. (You may need to add more sugar and/or vinegar to adjust-I don't measure) Enjoy!",

I made enough for 8 servings, so I used 2 1.5lb tenderloins. I pricked each with a fork before marinating for maximum absorbtion. I doubled the cooking time, but cooked at 325 degrees. Meat was very flavorful, with barely a hint of bourbon. I thought the soy would be too salty, but it wasn't. The brown sugar helped temper the soy sauce. Wonderful recipe. A guaranteed \"will make again\".",

To thicken sauce, I added cold, cubed butter (about 2 1/2 tbsp.) stirring constantly with whisk. Serve tenderloin, pour reduction sauce over it and garlic smashed potatoes are a great side dish!!",

This was REALLY, REALLY easy, and my husband said it was \"The best pork he ever had\" (we are both great cooks, and also travelers and sort of \"foodies\", so that really IS saying something!)\n\nThe only things I did differently (because I decided last-minute to try this recipe) were to: 1) cut the tenderloin into 1-inch filets, 2) make the marinade for 12 servings 3) place the tenderloins single-layer in a glass baking dish, 4) pour the marinade over the entire thing (since I wasn't able to marinade it), and 5) add some pepper (hubby loves it).  \n\nI then cooked the tenderloin for about 30 minutes at 325f, turned each piece over (and reversed the outside and inside pieces, to ensure all cooked the same), turned up the heat to 400f and cooked about another 20 minutes. \n\nNeedless to say, hubby is glad we made extra--he snacked on a third of it before it even got to the table, tried to convince the kids it was horrible so he could have more, and then made sure he put the tiny bit of leftovers out of the way so he could have more today.  Now, if that's not a great endorsement of this recipe, I don't know what is!",
