Pour over rolls and continue with the orig recipe. I also make extra sauce and boil it down until it thickens and add that over the cooked rolls.",

Very good taste and I loved the freezing the head of cabbage idea however make sure you have enough time to thaw it before cooking--mine took about 9 hours. So you may be better off steaming if you are in a time crunch. The only difference I made in the recipe was not cooking the rice. As stated before it cooks in the oven so there isn't any need. I also used tooth picks on some of my rolls b/c teh ones with smaller leaves started unrolling a bit. And like the others I used a family size can of tomato soup b/c I wanted extra sauce for the white rice side dish. Will make again but next time will check them more frequently in the oven because mine got done slightly quicker.",
