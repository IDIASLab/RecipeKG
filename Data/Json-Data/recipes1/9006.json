The recipe on it's own should get three stars. With my adjustments it's more than. I used a half cup of softened butter and whipped it with the sugar using half white and half brown until fluffy. I then added two eggs instead of one and threw in a little vanilla flavoring. I used the full amount of oats but I ground them down in my blender to make a smoother consistancy. I only needed one cup of flour not three. I cut back the baking flour to two teaspoons. I alternated the grapefruit juice with the dry ingredients to keep the batter consistant and folded in a 1/2 c. of grapefruit sections I'd cut into thirds. I also added a 1/2 c. of cubed pears and a tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. This turned out interesting. Very tasty. This was useful for me as it used items that I had on hand and it will be great for a quick breakfast for the kids and I tomorrow. It's best with a little butter spread on.",

Left out the walnuts (didn't have) and mixed chopped pecans with pure maple syrup and raw sugar and sprinkled on top. Baked in 9x13 glass pan instead of loaf. Brought it to work and the guys loved it. We have so many grapefruits here in Phoenix this time of year I will definitely make it again (with my revisions).",

I'm giving this recipe a 5 although mine was actually a 4.5 in my husband's opinion. I altered the recipe after reading everyones reviews and falling short on some oats. I used 4 packets of instant oatmeal (3 w/ apples 1 w/ cinnamon) and substituted bulgar wheat=1/2cup (hot water saturated like tabouli). Because I like things sweet tasted the batter before egg was added in addition to the honey I also added Sugar in the Raw to the recipe aproximately 1/4 cup added a bit more juice to make the batter more liquidy as my batter was stiff (Probably due to my added bulgar wheat) so added maybe 1/4 cup more. I also sprinkled the top with almonds and Sugar in the Raw. My bread is very filling and wonderfully textured and I love the crunch on top with the sugar and almonds. Yum.",

I juiced them for this recipe (which I doubled) and it came out wonderfully. I was short on honey and flour so I supped a little maple syrup and wheatgerm/cake flour respectively. The bread is not overly sweet but flavorful with just a hint of fruit underneath. The walnuts add nice crunch. I refrigerated the batter overnight and the next morning it was pretty thick. I was worried that would affect the bread but it didn't seem to. The next time I make this I might add more cinnamon. It is excellent served with cream cheese ricotta and jam.",
