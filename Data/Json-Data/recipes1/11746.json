I made a number of changes the most significant being leaving out the eggs and cutting down the oil (seeing as previous reviewers found it somewhat mushy). I added chopped eggplant tomato and onion as well as 3 cloves of minced garlic - tossing the whole thing with italian seasoning salt and pepper and fresh basil. I put a thin covering of bread crumbs on top instead of mixing it in (which would also cut down the mushiness) and added a layer of cheese in the last 10 minutes in the oven. At 40 minutes the veggies were crisp without being overcooked which in my book made them perfect! While I wouldn't have thought to put on breadcrumbs before finding this recipe they made it more filling and added a nice flavour. The whole thing was so tasty that despite the fact that I thought I had made HEAPS every last bit was gobbled up! I think this would be a great recipe to make for a potluck dinner - incredibly simple but SO satisfying and tasty that it makes you look like you put in a lot of effort!",
