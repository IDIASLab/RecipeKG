Some use cake flour, some all purpose flour, but the more you make this pound cake you'll find you won't even need a recipe for it anymore because the \"formula\" is so simple and straightforward, the ingredients and measurements like science.  All variations are dependable and excellent but...  this recipe is a little different from others  in that it has a lighter, less dense crumb and is soooo tender and soft.  I attribute that to the fact that cake flour and whipping cream are used.  Exceptional, with expertly written instructions for those not familiar with the techniques necessary to make a perfect, heavenly pound cake. (The eggs are the only leavener in this type of cake for instance, so the creaming of the butter and sugar, then adding the eggs one by one to keep the batter emulsified and aerated is critical!)  I used this batter for cupcakes today, adding about 1/4 cup of mullti-colored jimmies (fun!) and frosted them with a simple buttercream frosting.",

My standard recipe that I've been using for many years is a bit heavier with an additional 1/2 cup butter and an 8 oz. package of cream cheese. I didn't think I'd ever find another pound cake recipe that I'd enjoy as much my old standard. This recipe is a very nice surprise! I made this cake exactly as written to take to my granddaughter's third birthday party and it received rave reviews. One woman said that it tasted like a cross between a homemade angel food cake and a pound cake. She renamed it \"angel pound cake\" and took home a very large piece. My sons claim that they prefer my \"older\" recipe; I've decided that next time I'm not going to mention that I tried a different recipe. I on the other hand LOVE this new recipe. The next time I make this I'm going to throw in a good amount of Irish Cream because I think the lightness of this cake is what makes it so adaptable to different flavorings. Great recipe; lighter than the standard and very very tasty. Thank you so much for posting it.",

It's everything a pound cake should be: dense, moist, buttery rich with a tender crumb. This is it. The recipe is basic, as well as quite forgiving. I only had half the whipping cream called for, so I subbed 1/2 cup of buttermilk for the missing cream, and added a couple of pinches of baking soda, which neutralizes the acid in the buttermilk. I stayed with the 2 tsp of vanilla extract, but also added a dash each of almond, maple, coconut, orange and lemon extracts. The result was a delightfully, subtly complex flavor. It made an outstanding base for pureed strawberries and ice cream, and turned the ordinary into a memorable dessert. Subbing Splenda for half of the sugar (equal measurement) turns out just the same as if you had used all sugar. I sprinkled the pan with sugar after greasing it, and the crust was attractively shiny, giving a little punch of sweetness. Note: Cutting the ingredients in half fits perfectly in a 9\"X5\" loaf pan.
