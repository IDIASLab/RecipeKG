He loved it but reminded me that this would actually be served with mashed potatoes and called \"mince and taties\" and not served as a pie.  The gravy in a real scottish mince meat pie is less beefy, more peppery with a thicker consistency and looks somewhere between clear and grey not brown.  Still, this hit the mark as \"mince\" and I think I'll serve the leftovers with some mashed potatoes! I would caution against adding salt.  The boullions have enough.",

Also the mix of ground beef and pie crust was a little too rich for me. However there was something oddly comforting about it but next time I want some comfort food I'll make meatloaf!",
