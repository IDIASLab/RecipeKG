They make a wonderful dish with ripe plantains (like a bananna but not quite as strong-flavored) and ground meat with olives and sofrito (a mixture of onion garlic sweet peppers olive oil and tomatoes plus culantro) and either roll it up like pinwheels or layer it like a lasagna. The sweet and the savory are really very good together. I'll bet this rather tastes like that and I am going to try it!",

Like one of the other reviews said, you may want to substitute plantains for the bananas for a more subtle flavor. I thought this was great!\n\nUpdated 7/6/10:\nSeven years and three children later this is still one of my favorite recipes, and my kids love it too! I always brush the outside with Pickapeppa sauce - it makes a nice glaze with a hint of spicy to complement the subtle sweetness of the banana. I've also made a pineapple or mango salsa to seve along side of it, but even grilled pineapple slices work great!",
