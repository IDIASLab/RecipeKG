I prefer swirling the chocolate and orange together like in Simone's picture. It balances the cookies out as oppose to Mallinda's picture. When it is only half + half the cookie tastes incomplete. So remember mix + swirl! (Take a small amount of the orange dough and then a small amount of the chocolate dough and roll it inyour hands!)",

I didn't have to add more flour to the recipe I didn't have to chill just floured my hands. I also rolled some of the dough individually (didn't mix them together) to make some orange cookies and some chocolate cookies. They were great! So perfectly round my friends were amazed at the presentation and flavor! Great recipe will use again! - - - - I made these cookies a second time but instead of the dark chocolate/orange combination I did a white chocolate/strawberry combo (substituded white chocolate and instead of orange zest I put in a few tablespoons of strawberry jam and a few drops of red food coloring). Due to the liquidity of the jam I did have to add about a half a cup more flour and this time I refrigerated the dough. They turned out great I loved that flavor combination!",

The dough was sticky and hard to work with; I had to chill it before rolling the cookies just so it didn't stick to everything. They're a bit cake-like. The orange was nice and orange-y I added orange extract; the chocolate was just OK. Overall these required a lot of work; not worth it for a) a marginal cookie and b) a low-yielding recipe.",
