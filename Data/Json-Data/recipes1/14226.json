I prefer to cube the sausage rather than slice -- just cut slices about 5/8\" thick and then quarter them -- easier to spoon up too! Used 3/4 cup rice (which didn't cook up completely but that was alright) 1 can of the tomatoes and 1 can of spicy chili beans. Didn't have any thyme or bay leaf but did add a couple shakes of crushed red pepper. This cooked up real spicy and would have been great with or without the beans IMO. Good stuff - thanks!",
