Topping the pie when it's hot is the WORST possible suggestion EVER!!!!  It will always weep if you do this...ALWAYS. FINALLY I figured out a fool proof way to get the meringue NOT to weep: Allow the filling to cool at room temperature until completely cooled and firm.  And NEVER put the pie in the fridge.  Once it's cooled, make your meringue.  Be sure to have the meringue cover the pie to the crust completely and then place it in the oven at 350 degrees (immediately) for 10-15 minutes or until the meringue is brown (careful, keep a close eye on it, because the meringue can go from \"brown\" to \"black\" very quickly--especially if you are someone who likes to have \"peaks\" in your meringue.)  Now, once the pie comes out of the oven let it cool completely at ROOM TEMPERATURE...NEVER place a Lemon Meringue Pie in the fridge UNLESS you want it to weep and get all watery.  I don't know where this urban legend about covering a hot filling with meringue started, but it's WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!!!!!\n",

I don't think I'd made a lemon meringue pie before and I was extremely pleased with the way this one turned out; I will definitely use this recipe again!\r\n\r\nSome notes to prevent shrinkage of the meringue and \"weeping\" (extra moisture under the meringue.  (These tips are from a section on preparing meringue in one of my cookbooks.)  Don't let the lemon filling cool too much; instead of putting it in the refrigerator til lukewarm, after preparing it make the meringue and spoon the designated amount of meringue into the hot/very warm lemon mixture.  Spoon the filling into the baked pie crust, and cover with the remaining meringue while still very warm.  Make sure to spread the meringue well, to the edges, touching the crusts.  These steps should prevent the meringue from shrinking away from the crust and getting soggy underneath!",

I took MARIAHAN'S advice and did not cool the sugar mixture before adding the rest of the ingredients. I had no separation problems and the texture was perfect. Not rubbery or chalky. I did need to add two extra egg whites as there didn't seem to be enough meringue for the top of the pie. I like my meringue pies high and \"peaky\". I also cut back on the sugar a bit and added more lemon juice. My only slight problem was when I cut into it. There was a small amount of liquid on the pie plate just under the crust. I don't know if this is a typical or if it was because the pie had to travel 45 minutes to it's final destination. It was still somewhat warm when we left the house. Other than that everyone absolutely loved it. Thanks Rhonda!",

Had some misgivings about folding some of the meringue into the filling and I wonder if this is where this recipe failed for us. Wasted perfectly good Meyer lemons from my little tree. Will not be making this again.",
