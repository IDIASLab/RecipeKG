I didn't press the cookies flat with a glass dipped in sugar (I was out of granulated and needed some cookies QUICK) so I just pressed them lightly with my fingers. My family doesn't like really crisp cookies so I didn't press them too much. Anyway they turned out almost like Mexican Wedding Cakes- slightly sweet sugar cookies that melt in your mouth. YUM!",
