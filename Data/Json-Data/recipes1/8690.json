As for the cooking method, there's a easier way.  Place the eggs in a pan and cover with at least an inch or more of cold water.  Bring to a full rolling boil, remove from heat, let sit for 15 minutes, drain, and cover with ice water until thoroughly chilled.  This will eliminate the ugly green/blue ring around the yolk.
