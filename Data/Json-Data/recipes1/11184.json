I think the 1/2 cup butter or margarine and 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder in the middle of the ingredients list is intended to begin the frosting ingredients but is duplicative.......... I tried to make this a layer cake but it was too moist so next time I will use a 9x13 casserole dish........The frosting wasn't moist enough so I added an additional 6 teaspoons of cola.  With these corrections or additions, I would rate this 5 stars. :-)",
