I browned the pork chops in the same skillet, seasoning them with a good amount of season salt, garlic powder and pepper while in the skillet, transferred to the baking pan and topped with onion mixture and soup.

                "reviewBody": "This is a great starter recipe. I took some of his ideas and some of mine and kind of mingled them together. First I decided to brown my meat (6 chops) in the skillet w/ some garlic,pepper, and seasoning salt to my liking. Then I mixed 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup w/ milk and added 2 cans of mushrooms, the chops, covered, and baked. It turned out delicious! The meat was very tender and moist. I separated the meat and the \"gravy\" and poured the \"gravy\" over the meat and the mashed potatoes I served with the chops. As far as everyone giving this recipe a bad review, they need to stop and think about everyone's different tastes. As far as it being bland, everyone has a different threshold for spices.  And as far as it being dry, a quick fix of covering it with aluminum foil to lock in the moisture might do the trick. It seemed to work for me. Anyways, once again a GREAT starter recipe, and I will definatly be making again. Thanks and God Bless",

I was asked to make this agian and again. I did do as other reviewers suggested and heavily season the pork chops before browning them. I also used an 2 cans of cream of mushroom and one of celery. I think 2 cans would be plenty next time. I also added extra onions since my family is such a big fan of them and omitted the extra mushrooms as I'm not a big fan. Thanks for the tasty recipe! I've also made this by chopping up the pork seasoning & browning then slow cooking and serving over egg noodles or rice.",

I then set those aside and browned the pork chops in the same oil, seasoning both sides with seasoning salt, pepper, garlic powder, ginger, and thyme. I mixed together the soup, leftover water from the canned mushrooms, onion, and mushrooms, and then added all the same spices to that mix for the sauce. Since the pork chops were already browned, I baked them for only 30 minutes, at which point they were thoroughly cooked but still juicy. The results were fantastic! It would've probably been bland, but the thyme and browning the meat really made the recipe. Will cook this again!",
