But I must say, after reading through the recipe thoroughly I wasn\u2019t impressed, and wondered, truly, what the real advantage was of preparing the rice this way rather than the stovetop method regardless of the number of servings.  This recipe\u2019s method requires more steps and more pans.  The stovetop method is a \u201cone stop shop.\u201d  Also, I\u2019m not sure I like the ratio of rice to liquid either - in my mind, it should always be one part rice to (at least) two parts cooking liquid, be it water or stock.  I like the addition of saffron and onion, but neither is anything special.  And the cayenne isn\u2019t necessary at all.  Frankly, the bottom line is that this is a basic, simple rice with an unnecessarily complicated way of cooking it.  In addition to simply cooking it on the stove top I made it a little more colorful and festive by adding a medley of colorful finely chopped bell peppers, fresh minced garlic and a good handful of frozen peas. Prepared as directed, this requires unnecessary steps that don\u2019t benefit the final result.",

I made it a second time and cut the salt back to 1 tsp. and the cayenne by half. That time I got the cayenne amount right, but still working on the salt amount.

I am giving it 5 stars because I LOVE the technique and the flavor is amazing!  My twin toddlers gobbled it down and my husband couldn't stop smiling as he complimented my cooking over and over and over.\r\n\r\nFirst, I read a review complaining about the amount of pots used.  You can use the same pot for both stovetop steps.  Not complicated.\r\n\r\nSecond, changes I made.  I added broken up vermicelli to create a box-rice effect.  It was an amazing addition.  I saut\u00e9ed that with the onions.  I used bouillon in lieu of stock as that was what I had on hand.  Accordingly, I cut down on the salt, which I would have also done since I was using salted butter.\r\n\r\nThird, what I would change next time.  1) use 3.5 cups of stock.  The ratio I know is always 2 parts liquid for 1 part rice.  While the rice was amazing, it was a teeny bit crunchy.  I think 4 cups of rice would mean soggy rice so I don't feel the normal ratio is warranted.  Sealing with foil really keeps the steam in and I think that helps.  Still, a little more liquid would have made a difference. 2) only use 1/8 tsp of cayenne.  The kick from the cayenne was a little much for what I was after with this dish.  With that said, it's not overwhelming as is.  Just family preference there. \r\n\r\nThis is an amazing, surprisingly simple, and most definitely a go-to dish for us going forward!",

I used water instead of the chicken stock and added chicken bouillon because I ran out of chicken stock.  I left out the salt because the bouillon is already salty.  I also added about a tablespoon of garlic to the last two minutes of simmering the liquid.  The rice came out wonderful.  Perfectly cooked, fluffy and yummy.",
