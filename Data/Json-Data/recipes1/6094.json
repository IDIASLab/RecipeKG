We have never tried a cold soup before because it never sounded all that appealing. After I mixed everything together and took a look at the soup, I thought to myself, \"yuck\" and quickly made a plan B for dinner (pizza delivered). I took a taste and was shocked at how good it was! We ate it all. Great flavor and consistency. I did what HIPPYJEN75 did and made \u201cGrilled Poblano Pepper and Mango Quesadillas\u201d using the mango filling from the \u201cFish Tacos with Tropical Fruit Salsa\u201d recipe we recently made. Everything turned out delicious. The only difficulty with this recipe is finding GOOD tomatoes. I went to 3 different stores looking for tomatoes and was not happy with any, so I broke down and used canned tomato juice. I did buy two vine ripened tomatoes to dice up for the soup, but even they had no tomato flavor. Does anyone know where to buy/get GOOD tomatoes that TASTE like tomatoes? We will make this soup again.",

I served this with the Grilled Poblano Pepper and Mango Quesadillas from this site.  My husband said that this must be added to the rotation.  Thanks so much for the delicious recipe.  Oh, and taking the time to juice the tomatoes is worth it, as well as having the freshest ingredients that you can find.  The only change I made was to use dried cilantro (the store was out of fresh) and also used fresh basil because I had some and wanted fresh herb included.   Again, thanks so much!!!",
