Preferred, traditional frying method is with lard but oil will work fine.  I usually mix equal portions.  Grandma used a large paper bag, and dropped them in immediately after removing from the fryer.  The bag absorbs a lot of the oil.  Then, she transferred them to another clean bag, added her choice of coating, and shook the bag.",

I also know that they are usually filled with a prune filling (traditionally) and they don't usually have raisins directly in the dough. So instead of raisins, I chopped up prunes and added them to the dough; and I also filled some of them with a prune filling I made--a kind of compromise lol. I also used rapid rise yeast instead of a compressed yeast cake (it is difficult for me to find that here). I made the yeast sponge by warming the milk with a little bit of sugar in the microwave until it was warm to the touch. Added in the yeast and flour and let it sit for a bit. Then I creamed together the egg yolks, egg, and sugar in a separate bowl until pale yellow and the sugar had dissolved. Then I mixed in the melted butter, vanilla, orange zest, salt, and prunes to the egg mixture. Also 1/2 cup of orange zest would be way too much--only use a tablespoon or two at most. Then added in the yeast sponge, and the rest of the flour, and followed through with the rising of the dough. It is a sticky dough, but you should still be able to form it into a ball. I also patted the dough out to about 1/2\" thick, and cut out rounds using a 3 inch round cookie cutter before frying. Make sure that your paczki's are no more than a 1/2\" thick or they will not cook all the way in the center (I had that issue with a few). I also baked a few in the oven at 350 for about 25-30 minutes, and they are ridiculously flaky! Overall, very good doughnuts! Thank ",
