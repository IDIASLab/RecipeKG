Well I was wrong - this gets 5 stars along with some of my other pork favorites!  Made no changes other than to put the seasonings on the meat and wrapped the meat in plastic wrap for a few hours \n(I do that with a lot of my roasts if I have time so that \nthe flavor seeps in).  I also put slits into the roast and inserted slivers of garlic in the slits (which I always do \nwith pork roasts - my preference).  I decided to follow \nVini's cooking directions exactly and my 3 lb. pork \nroast was cooked PERFECTLY!!!  Just slightly pink - as \nit should be!!  Soooooo moist.  Also decided to make \nthe gravy as Vini suggested rather than doing it my \nway which is work intensive and sometimes can be a \ndisaster if you are cooking other things at the same \ntime.  Vini's gravy was EXCELLENT - Novice chefs will \nlove his recipe for gravy - you can't go wrong! Since it \nwas Columbus Day and everyone had to work except \nfor me I made this roast and all the trimmings - \nmashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, Stove Top Pork \nStuffing, Asian style green beans, the last of the \nsummer tomatoes, and apple sauce.  Well we feasted that night - and just like Thanksgiving - we enjoyed the leftovers the next night since the meat remained so moist!  Thanks Vini!",

I had a 3.25 # roast and checked at 90 minutes and it was to right temperature. We are cutting carbs so I left out the cornstarch and went for some more flavoring for a \"gravy\". I added some broth and some red wine vinegar and boiled it a few minutes with the left over juices and added water. I served by slicing (very important to let it \"rest\" for about 10 minutes before slicing) into 1/2 thick slices and pouring the thin sauce over and letting it set in the juices covered in a warm oven while I made side dishes. Wow! moist and great flavor. Thank you for probably the best recipe I have tried(And I have tried QUITE a few) on this website.",

The meat was a little pink on the inside which I fixed with a brief stop in the micro. The gravy was simply tremendous--like I knew exactly what I was doing (I didn't have a clue). I served this with Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes available on this website Bavarian sauerkraut garlic bread sticks and tossed salad with homemade blue cheese dressing. You bet I deserve a medal!",
