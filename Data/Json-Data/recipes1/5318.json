I add about a 1/2 teaspoon to each, but also increase the amount of berries to 5 cups and orange juice to about 1/2 cup. Also I read many reviews of this recipe being too sweet, but I find that with fruit recipes you really have to taste the fruit before you use it to know how much sugar is needed. I rather like the cakey cobbler this recipe produces as opposed to some with a denser topping. The best compliment this recipe can get from me is that even my very picky hubby requests it regularly. Thanks for a nice basic recipe.",

I have added 1/2 tsp of lemon zest(grated peel) and a bare sprinkle of cinnamon to the blueberry mixture on the bottom.

The crunch and nuttiness were missing previously.  Mix all streusel topping ingredients together with a pastry blender or forks and sprinkle evenly over the middle layer, baking for 35-40 minutes as usual.  Vanilla ice cream is a must for most fans.

My cobbler was done cooking in just under 30 minutes.  I served it with Cool Whip, and it was a big hit.  I know it sounds like a lot of changes, but I read a year's worth of reviews, and these were changes suggested by many users.  I will definitely add this to my dessert rotation!",

The only modifications I made were: Instead of 1/3 C pure orange juice I diluted it down with water to make 1/3 C liquid. (I am not a big orange juice fan so I adjusted it for my liking!) I used 4 Cups blueberries because we had an overabundance of them and didn't want them to go to waste. The blueberries bake down and didn't overtake the entire cobbler. Finally I doubled the topping but found that the center did not cook fully so next time I might only do it 1.5 times versus doubling the recipe. We will make this again and again! It is WONDERFUL!",
