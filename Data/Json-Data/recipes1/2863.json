Didn't like the other one because it was too much like bread.  Followed this one just as written, but admit I did add a little milk because I was worried it might be dry like the other one.  Actually, had to bake it a little longer (due to the added milk).  Next time I will do just as written and I am sure it will be the creamy consistency I am after. Be sure NOT to drain the can of whole kernel corn. Very good!!",
