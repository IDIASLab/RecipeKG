For variation, try folding the salsa into the first three ingredients (after mixing them together), rather than spreading it on top.  Then, layer whatever you want on top (we do shredded cheese, chopped tomatoes, and diced scallions).  You can't go wrong with experimenting with different amounts of the various ingredients to reach different consistencies.  This recipe also lends itself well to lowfat or fat-free sour cream and cream cheese.",
