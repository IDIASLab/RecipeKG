It's virtually impossible to cream such a small amount of butter with 8 times the amount of sugar!  The butter will never get creamy, but will stay overly grainy and sugary from all that sugar.  A much better and simpler way is to melt the butter and add it to the wet ingredients, and then add the sugar to the dry ingredients. The best part about these cupcakes is they are lowfat!",
