Also, I added a bunch of whole green olives with pimientos and I highly recommend that!!  And, I added lots of lemon juice, more cayenne, and more cumin.... I actually added too much cayenne but today it had toned down a bit and the flavors had melded so it was even better!  I think this would only be 3 stars without the adjustments, and what made it into five stars is that it tastes FABULOUS with cottage cheese!  I don't mean that you should mix it in with the beans and rice, just put some on your plate and then get a bit of cottage cheese on your fork along with the beans and rice for each bite.  I think the cottage cheese tastes so great with it because of the difference between hot and cold and spicy and mild.  Definitely try the cottage cheese! :o)",

I made the following changes: 1 tsp granulated garlic instead of 2 cloves (non in the house), chicken broth instead of veggie, 2 tsp cumin, only 1 can of black beans, plus added 1 can of corn (drained) and 1 can of Rotel tomatoes (undrained).  My husband loved it and has asked that it be added to our menu on a regular basis.  We used it as a burrito filling, a quesadilla filling, and a stand-alone dish.  I also added extra chicken broth to some of the leftovers and made it into soup.  The mixture would also be good on top of nachos or combined with chicken and cheese to make a casserole.  Cheese and/or sour cream are good compliments.  Next time, I will lower the cayenne to 1/8 tsp (the Rotel adds enough heat for my taste) and use 2 cans of beans (black, pinto, and kidney would all work well in this dish).",
