I have tried many recipes from this site but was never inspired enough (postive or negative) to post a comment.  However, this recipe rocks. I did have to tweak it based on what I had on hand -- I used stick margerine, and substituted nonfat dry milk for the cocoa, because I wanted a vanilla frosting (I substitute NFDM for 1/3 of the sugar in most of my baking recipes).  I think because I used margarine, which is more watery than butter, I only had to use about half the milk.  Anyway, the taste is absolutely yummy.  It's a great consistancy and eminently spreadable, even on a crumbly baked-with-applesauce-instead-of-oil cake.  Easy to make and apply, delicious, what more could you ask for?  This recipe isn't just a keeper, it's going to be laminated for a place in my recipe hall of fame!  Love it!!!!!!!",

I beat it a good several minutes so by the time it was done it was just beautifully fluffy. I didn't measure the milk just added it until I was happy with the consistency I wanted for piping.

The trick is to make sure you beat the butter real good before you begin adding the confectioner's sugar and cocoa. Using a hand mixer, beat in as much as you can, then begin to add milk, a little a time. Also, as the package indicates, adjust the amount of cocoa to your taste; 1/4 cup for light flavor, 1/2 cup for medium flavor and 3/4 cup for dark flavor (which is what I use). Do you like \"darK\" chocolate over \"milk\" chocolate. Then use 1/2 cup of Hersheys \"Special Dark\" cocoa powder. The frosting is almost black in color - a whole different taste!",
