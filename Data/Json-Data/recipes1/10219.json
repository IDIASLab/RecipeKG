I didn't have whole graham crackers, so I used some graham cracker crumbs, sugar and butter to make a baked graham cracker crust. When that cooled, I prepared and spread the peanut butter mixture over it. I followed THAT part of the recipe exactly, and was very very impressed with the texture and taste of the final product - tasted very much like \"real\" peanut butter cup peanut butter. I really liked the crust underneath the peanut butter and chocolate, and will make it again exactly as I did before. It's an extra step, but well worth it, in my opinion.",
