I let each layer harden in frige before adding the next. I preferred the flavor of milk chocolate to the semi-sweet having tried both. Also don't add too much peanut butter or it is like eating a huge tablespoon of peanut butter. I make buckeye balls every year and actually prefer the filling of those but the ease of these. I think I will be combining the two methods instead! Maybe just a softer creamier version of the buckeye filling! Great idea though! Never even thought of it after 15 years of rolling and dipping buckeye balls!!!",

My daughter has a peanut allergy so I used her soy nut butter. Because it's Easter I made the filling into egg shapes and simply dipped them into the chocolate. So much easier than having to make the cups. I had my older daughter test taste them and she said they were delicious and tasted very much like Reeses. Thank you so much Pam for a great start to a wonderful treat that I know Ty will be so appreciative of tomorrow morning!",
