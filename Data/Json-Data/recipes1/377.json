I make a coconut filling but without nuts and refidgerate. Make the chocolate cookie part and put in the freezer for 1 hour after that roll flat between two pieces of wax paper and lay flat in the refidgerater for 2 hours or freezer for 1/2 hour more. After chilling time cut the chocolate into circles (I used a glass). Put about a tablespoon of coconut mixture in the center and fold up the cookie around it. Flatten the bottoms and put on a cookie sheet. Continue with the remaining dough and then refidgerate for another 1/2 hour or so. Then bake until set. So yummy! I never have leftovers. They take a while to make and are involved but are soooo worth it!",
