                "reviewBody": "This recipe is really great, but I have some changes that can make it near perfect.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, canola oil in place of vegetable oil, and I reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and they are still super sweet, and even down to 1/3 cup and they're still yummy.  For flavor I always use 1 tsp. of cinnamon and a whole cup of raisins.  To make them chewy still use a 9x13 pan but don't spread the mixture into the entire pan- leave about an inch and a half empty space on one end.  (The batter will cook exactly as it sits so you don't have to worry about it spreading.  Also, you must be careful not to overcook these.  Thirty minutes is way too long, but since every oven is different I can only really tell you that you need to take them out right when you see the edges becoming brown (the middle may still appear undone.)  For me that is 18 minutes.  If you do that they will stay chewy forever--just store them in a ziploc bag.  And my last bit of advice is that you can get really creative with this recipe.  For example, instead of raisins add dried cranberries and slivered almonds. Or up the cinnamon and add chopped dried apples.  Or you could add peanut butter and freeze dried banana bits (like you find in the toddler section).   Or you could play around with some canned pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice. Just have fun!",

What I usually do is throw in whatever leftover  bananas (goes great with the vanilla), applesauce, trail-mix, etc. into the mix! (this week I put in blueberries) Some weeks I put about a 1/4 cup peanut butter with the wet ingredients.  Sometimes I put lemon, almond (especially yummy) or rum flavoring with the vanilla.  Most times it comes out like a granola bar, sometimes like a cookie bar, but it's always good.  I sometimes use whole wheat flour too.  The only time I messed up this recipe, it came out a little dry and wouldn't cut without crumbling.  I just crumbled it up, threw it back in the oven for a bit and had some mean granola.    A good tip with this recipe is to measure out the vegetable oil first and then use the same measuring cup for the honey....it prevents the honey from sticking.  Always wonderful, I have some baking right now.",

The kids and hubby devoured them and immediately requested more. The 2nd time I added 1/2 cup of apple sauce to the mix . This made the bars much easier to cut and gave them a more chewy, cookie-like texture. The fam. inhaled these, as well. In the future, I guess I'll add apple sauce and make them more chewy depending on the mood of my kids that day, (my husband prefers the crunchy). Thanks!!!",

As suggested by other reviewers, I lowered the brown sugar to 1/2 c.  I also replace the honey with Splenda.  I used cranberries and walnuts instead of raisins, plus increased cinn. to 1t and added 1/4 t allspice as others suggested.  To make them heart-healthy, I lowered the wheat germ to 1/4 c and added 1/4 c ground flax seed.  MY husband and I love these...my 3 and 5 year old prefer dried blueberries in theirs.

I made them with pure maple syrup (prefer honey) Made them with chopped walnuts, very good. I also add sliced almonds on top & lightly pat down, good & very pleasing to the eye too. ;) I made them with chocolate chips, we did not like these very much, even my little ones prefer raisins or craisins. I also tried adding half applesauce in place of the oil and they are not near as good, way too dry. I use \"Old Fashioned oats\" & double the recipe & bake on a foil lined jelly roll pan, I spray lightly with pam. I get rave reviews from all who have tried these, I make them & send them to work with my husband,- his co-workers love 'em! as do my children & their friends! you will not be disappointed, you can really add whatever you like to make it \"your own\".  I'm going to try dried blueberries next! YUM!",

I added stone milled flour instead of white and reduced it to 2/3 cup cut the sugar to 1/2 cup added 1/3 cup each flax seeds sesame seeds and sunflower seeds and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Any dried fruit is also a great addition. We pack them on hiking trips they are very filling and keep you full. They also freeze well but they seem to dissapear right from the freezer!",
