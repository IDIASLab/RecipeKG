I did make some changes like everyone always does; I used no-cook noodles put about 1 cup sauce in the bottom of the dish used jarred tomato sauce because I was time crunched and browned the meat w/the jar of sauce. I layered it as stated in the recipe added another jar of sauce on top of the final layer and added more shredded cheese on top but covered it as stated on the box of no cook noodles. I baked it @ 375 degrees for 50 minutes took the cover off and baked for another 10.Then I let it sit about 10 minutes.Awesome! This is the 1st lasagna that didn't run all over the plate when you try to serve it.My whole family loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!;)",

I kept the cheese the same although I did add more fresh parmesan but I used a pound of italian sausage and browned it up added minced garlic to that and cooked some fresh sliced button mushrooms to it as well. (don't forget to drain the grease) Then instead of using the tomato sauce I got some name brand pasta sauce that had mushrooms in it and another that was like 4 cheese or something... both of the jars that I used were about 26 oz. This is alot more then the orginal recipe calls for but it really made it nice and moist. I did not use the full two jars. I used about 1 and 1/2. I heated the sause up before I added it to the layers and mixed in salt suger and spices to taste. I finished it off with fresh mozz on top! Have fun this turned out great for me!",

Like many others I added to it - added sausage and beef herbs garlic (my family loves garlic)I used jar sauce because I was pressed for time. Can't understand why others are saying it was dry? Perhaps they are using no bake noodles or thick sauce? I would really recommend this recipe as a wonderful starting point to create one's signature lasagna dish.",
