                "reviewBody": "The syrup is always added first in the glass because if you add milk first you can't tell how much syrup you are adding. This makes portion control impossible in a restaurant. My problem with this receipt is the use of the term \"cup\". If you put selzer in a cup then chill it it becomes flat. Traditionally there is only one acceptable syrup for an egg-cream. That is \"U-Bet\" syrup. The key to a good egg cream is to have highly carbonated selzer well-chilled milk and a well mixed combination befgore the selzer is added. The amount of milk here is a bit much. You need a higher selzer to milk ratio for the best egg-cream. There are two parts to adding the selzer. First you add and stir till the mixture bubbles to the top. Then stop. Then add more selzer. The best egg-creams have a froth of chocolate bulles on the top. It is difficult to make a good egg cream without a seltzer bottle. Not impossible but difficult. You can also make vanilla egg-creams. The best glass for an egg cream is the coca-cola soda-fountain glass with the bell-shaped top.",
