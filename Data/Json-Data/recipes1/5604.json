These came out incredibly crispy and tasty!  I *did* make a couple of changes (after making them the way the recipe was posted once).  I actually omitted the cayenne.  We love spicy..but not necessarily in fries.  I used 1-1/2 tsps. of salt (that did the trick as far as taste goes) and I used olive oil instead of veggie oil.

Well, not good compared to the sweet potato ones I made before.

Baked for 30 min., turned them and then baked another ten minutes at 375.  This is definitely a keeper and one that I will make again and again.
