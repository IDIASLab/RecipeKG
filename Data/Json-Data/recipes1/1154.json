I took this to my 4th of July party, along with several homemade desserts and this one got eaten first. It was GONE in the blink of an eye. I made one change, which makes ALL the difference in presentation. Instead of stirring everything together, I layered into the crust: first the cream cheese mixture, then sliced strawberries, whipped cream - and repeated until everything was used up. Then I \"frosted\" the pie with whipped cream in a piping bag [to make it pretty]. I would give this 6 stars, if I could.",

This has such a great light flavor I just want to keep eating it! I chilled it for about 3 hours but the consistency was a little too soft for me..almost pudding-like. I stuck it in the freezer and I'll taste that tomorrow! The recipe made so much filling that I put about half in a zip-loc and put it in the freezer to use another time. I think it would be really good over pound cake or with shortbread cookies. This is a great-tasting light dessert that can be varied many ways. I'd love to try it with peaches and blueberries and maybe even with key lime juice. Will make this again..so easy on a hot summer day!",
