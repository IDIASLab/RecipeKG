I don't know if I over cooked the pasta or if Penne just naturally breaks apart like it did but that in itself didn't make it taste bad. It seemed like there was way too much mayo in it and too much dill and I couldn't even taste the lemon pepper. It also tasted like it contionously needed extra salt. I think the ingredients need to be more specific because when I was at the store I had the opportunity to chose from just plain lemon-pepper or lemon-pepper salt so I chose the former and I think thats why it needed salt and I couldn't tast the lemon pepper. Also this salad would seem to taste better with an oil based dressing (oil& vinegar; italian dressing)rather then mayo. I dont think that I'll be making this again.",
