Also, I didn't have any oranges so I  added 1/2 tsp lemon extract and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I also used 3/4 c. unsweetened strawberry apple sauce and 1/4 c. veg oil instead of 1 c. veg oil and used a little less salt. Also, I used fesh strawberries and half chopped half mashed them so there were chunks of strawberry in it. Highly recommended, came out great!",
