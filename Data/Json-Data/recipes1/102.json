I used finely chopped almonds (toasted) - wonderful!  A minute may be a bit long for the toffee to boil, as mine reached the soft ball stage by about 30 seconds, and I removed from heat at that point. It would have been way too hard if boiled any longer.  Thanks to you both Pamela and Victoria for this entirely addicting recipe!",

The only thing I will do next time is cook the graham cracker crust a few minutes less it tasted a little burned around the edges. But I'll definitely make again these were delish!",

It's worth the pain of stirring the toffee forever when you hear all of the rave reviews.  BIG HINT:  I use sliced almonds on top instead of walnuts - it makes the cookies look beautiful!  Many people thought I had bought them from a bakery - they looked professionally done with the almonds on top.",

If you have your heat too high then the butter sugar mixture will turn into a ball...otherwise will be fine. I boiled mine over a minute and it was great. I don't think it needs anymore chocolate...really really great bar!! Thank you!",

There is not enough butter to make the crust form and the cracker crumbs stayed just that... cracker crumbs... and did not adhere to the bottom of the toffee. So much for giving this as a gift. Secondly there was not enough toffee to cover the crumbs. It was a mess trying to spread it to the edges and I was not able to get any toffee into a couple of the corners. Third the completed bars were WAY TOO SWEET -- and I like sweet things but this was sickly. The graham cracker crust with the brown sugar put it over the top. It would be much better with more of a minimally-sweetened shortbread base. More cookie-like and not sweet and crumbly. I can't give this away along with my other Christmas cookies this year so am looking for a better recipe.",
