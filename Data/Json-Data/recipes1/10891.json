Instead of simmering in milk I made a white sauce from butter flour milk curry powder saffron salt and pepper...Yum!

Slight variation......she mixed the cheese (she used farm cheese) with an egg some salt and lots of black pepper. After making the dumplings she dropped them into boiling water and removed them with a slotted spoon once they floated. Place in a casserole dish and dollop with a little butter so they don't stick together. Keep warm. Saut\u00e9 1/4 to 1/2 lb of salt pork sliced very thin until crisp....set aside. If there is a lot of grease in the pan drain some off reserving about 1 - 2 T. Add at least 1 cup of sour cream to the drippings and heat thoroughly while scraping the pan. Add reserved salt pork and pour over dumplings. A great side dish in places of potatoes....and wonderful for breakfast! Truly in a pinch you can use frozen cheese ravioli",
