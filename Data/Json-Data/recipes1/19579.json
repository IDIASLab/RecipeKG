I made one with coffee ice cream and one with vanilla since I wasn't sure how the coffee would go over with all the kiddos. Both were amazing but the coffee was our favorite. Just seemed to have that extra special something. My aunt who is known for her mud pies said that her secret recipe involved a drizzle of Kahlua on the top. I might try that next! For the crust... I bought 3 prepackaged Oreo crusts and put them into my own prettier and bigger pie dishes. I wanted to make sure I had enough room for all the ice cream per other reviews. I had to add a smidge of melted butter to help bind the crust when I did this. Everything else I did the same... but I used a whole container of ice cream for each one not just a quart. Oh and I did only put one package of tini chocolate chips for both pies instead of just one. It was plenty. And for the topping... we like Reddi Whip so I put that around the edge and one dollop in the middle. I put cherries in the middle and Oreo cookies around the edge before I drizzled it all with syrup. Lastly I did only wait 40 minutes or so before each step. And yes like other reviewers said it is sweet. But that's what makes it so good! One of my sisters thought the bottom was cookie dough instead of just ice cream! When you slice it up it's as pretty as it is delicious! Thanks for the recipe!!",

I would recommend halving the chocolate chips in the bottom layer. My pie didn't look like the picture which looks like it has just a few chips in the bottom layer. I used the whole bag which may have been misunderstanding the recipe. And make sure you thoroughly freeze the bottom layer before you put on the hot fudge layer or they will get melted together.",

(I made this as written but substituted heavy whipping cream for the cool whip.) This is all just too much. Too. Much. The mini chocolate chips are a good idea but 12 oz is way too much...I would recommend 6 oz or even less. Even better would be a crushed Oreo layer between ice cream layers and skip the mini chips. The chocolate syrup on top of it all \u2014 again, just too much. (And I like chocolate!) Warming the fudge sauce and pouring it over the frozen ice cream made a mess, although added yumminess. I think I\u2019ll revert to my usual method: chocolate crust, coffee ice cream, warm fudge sauce poured over slice, add a generous dollop of whipped cream, and sprinkle with toasted almonds. Skip the chips. Consider the crushed cookies.",
