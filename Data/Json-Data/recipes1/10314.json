The only thing I would add is a great frosting that is really yummy is plain old vanilla Ice cream.  Freeze the cake overnight in your freezer and then take a quart of vanilla ice cream - mix it up in your mixer until it is a smooth frosting consistency and then frost your cake - put it back in the freezer for 4 hours or until frozen again and then decorate!  You can even go to Baskin Robbins and ask to purchase a quart of their vanilla frosting ice cream - it is completely white with no yellow in it.  HTH.",

With the container of ice cream I had, dividing it in half was going to waste alot more cake than I wanted to. So I split the ice cream into 3rds. It made a pretty good fit to a 13x9. I made a Milk Chocolate cake with Vanilla ice cream. Instead of frosting, I used \"Magic Shell\" in a kind of checkerboard design and sprinkled a few chopped pecan pieces on top. It looked wonderful and was sooo very easy. Everyone raved. Thanks for posting Monica.",

Line the bottom of one round with wax paper then fill with 1/2 gallon of ice cream (may need to let ice cream soften a bit first). Cover with saran wrap and put in the freezer. Bake your cake in the other two rounds. Let cool remove from rounds line rounds with wax paper and replace cakes cover and freeze for at least one hour. Then make a big sandwich: cake ice cream layer (which is easily flipped onto cake - perfect fit) cake. Wrap whole thing in saran wrap and store in freezer until ready to frost. I used the Cool Whip/milk/pudding mix frosting....which I thought was just ok. Next time will try the vanilla ice cream frosting. Put Magic Shell in a medicine dropper to decorate cake - worked GREAT! I put the cake on a flat plate frosted it and covered it with a cake dome and kept in the freezer until ready to serve.",
