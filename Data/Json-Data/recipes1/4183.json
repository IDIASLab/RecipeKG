When I first took them out of the oven the second time the lemon flavor was subtle but very nice. But by the next day the flavor had faded and become unpleasant and strange.. vaguely citrusy but it didn't meld well with the flavor of the almonds. I had made these for a friend and when I asked her if they were good she sort of giggled and said \"Well I wasn't going to say anything but....\" Also - I only used 1 1/2 tbsp. poppyseed and it was PLENTY. Sorry I won't make these again.",

The dough was sticky and I was able to form it into a log only by putting blobs of dough on the cookie sheet and smoothing it into log shape with wet fingers. I took another reviewers suggestion and used the leftover egg yolk to brush on the logs before baking. It probably isn't necessary but it keeps you from wasting the yolks. You MUST use a serrated knife to slice the logs. I had no trouble with mine cracking apart. The finished biscotti are very crisp but I wouldn't call them hard. I baked them the second time for 5 minutes on one side turned them and baked for 4 minutes on the other.",

As per other reviewers suggestions, I cut back the amount of poppy seeds to 1.5 tsp and used 2 tsp of Pure Lemon Extract - gives it a wonderful but not over-powering lemon flavour - PERFECT!!!  I have found a secret to not handling sticky biscotti dough,as it tends to gets stcky because of the heat in your kitchen so I place my dough in the fridge for about 20-25 minutes and this helps to firm it up and can be shaped into the logs without it sticking! Works like a charm on ANY biscotti recipe that I have tried so far! I love this lemon poppy seed recipe and will be making it often!",
