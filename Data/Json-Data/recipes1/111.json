If you do make them, I filled a large plastic bag with the frosting and then turned over half of them and lined them up.

I'm sure it saved a ton of time to do it this way and piping the icing was way faster than if I would have tried to scoop it in.",

These are so easy to make that my oldest daughter (age 10) was able to make them herself for a bake sale fundraiser. I would guess that they would freeze well but they never last that long at our house even when I double the recipe. Also as a time saver I use prepared cream cheese icing. One container of icing is sufficient for a double batch of cookies. Thanks so much to John for the best cookie recipe ever!! PS These cookies are even better than oreos.",
