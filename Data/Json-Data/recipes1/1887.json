We may have made this for a project but it will become a staple quick bread around this house! Only thing we did differently was to substitute half the white sugar with brown sugar.",

I baked it in a 9\" pie pan for 1/2 hour. It is great bread! So whether this is a true review or not I'm thankful for the recipe!",

Everything else I left the same. I thought this turned out to be a nice dense bread with a light sweetness. It worked well as a complement to the carrot soup we had for dinner. I did make in crocks to make big muffins and ended up with 4 large muffins that baked for 40 minutes. Thanks for the recipe!",
