Due to the high oven temperature, the secret to success is to use a thin cut of fish. I recommend 1\u201d thick or less.  Too thick and the crust will burn before the fish is done.  Since the recipe calls for cod filets, most frozen cod is usually too thick and should be horizontally cut in half before applying the crust and baking. I also took other reviewers advice and used the salt & vinegar chips. I recommend using a food processor to \u201ccrush\u201d the chips.  Once the chips were crushed, I added the cheese to the processor and gave it just a couple of more rotations to evenly mix the cheese and chips",

It came out great -watch your hand with the chili pepper if you dont like spicy food. Enjoy!",

My 15 year old son who hates fish, LOVED IT (everyone did). It tastes fried without immersing in oil ;)",

I love the fact that I used up the ends of bottles and the bottom of the chip bag...things you would normally just discard!So quick to make too! UPDATE! Used whiting this time a stronger fish and had to sub Mozzarella and Mexican Parm exellant crust on top!Mixed the cheese and chips in a ziploc added parsley for prettiness!PREVIOUSLY: SSoooooo easy! I used Tilapia and used mostly sharp cheddar but added a couple of tablespoons of blue cheese and pepper jack trying to use up some bits and pieces of leftover cheeses. I piled the topping on (i mayt have made extra topping since I just eyeballed it. Good way to use up the bottom of the chip bag! The timing and temperature were perfect....the only tip I would add is: Spray or grease the pan really really well! The cheese that melted off the edges of the fish wanted to stick and you don't want to fight with it to get it off the pan...use foil lining too.",

I hate to cook but this recipe is so easy to make and it turns out wonderful every time.  My boyfriend (who hates fish) practically eats the entire thing when I make this.  The only thing I do differently is marinate the fish in the Italian dressing for a longer time.  Also, I took the advice of the previous reviews and make sure my chips are Salt & Vinegar (and I add some jalapeno ones for a little spice) because it truly adds to the flavor.

Also, baked fish at 425 for 12 minutes.  Yum!  I served this with brown rice and asparagus--wonderful combo.  Will make this again--next time I will use the spicy Doritoes.  Topping is great!
