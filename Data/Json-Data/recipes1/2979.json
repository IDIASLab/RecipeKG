This recipe is probably not for everyone but you must at least try it. It complimented my whole meal very well it was nice and creamy and everyone really liked the different taste. Definitely not just for Thanksgiving! Thanks!",

My husband wasn't the biggest fan he said the oysters were too big but I would definitely make it again and just eat it myself!
