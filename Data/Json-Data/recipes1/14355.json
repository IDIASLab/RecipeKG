They're cute to look at, but OMG the stench of cruciferous veggies cooking just makes me gag. Plus I'm not into \"mushy middles\" (I think reviewers called it \"creamy\"). But I did want to try this recipe due to all the rave reviews. And now, I want to THANK the person who posted this fabulous recipe! My husband and I LOVED every morsel! I did do 2 changes: 1- we halved them, so that we wouldn't get \"mushy middles\", lol. And, I read somewhere that if you remove the \"choke\" that's at the bottom of the sprout (inside), the brussel sprout will not be bitter. Voila! it worked! These yummmy, salty, nutty, crunchy, carmelized brussel sprouts were SO good. No bitterness whatsoever! The super dark carmelized parts of the roasted bsprouts were the best! LUVVVVV this recipe, and will make over and over again! HUGE thanks!!",

I first had them prepared this way at a restaurant in downtown NYC around the corner from where I lived--absolutely addictive, and when I moved from that neighborhood I came up with my own version similar to this recipe. The only difference is that I sprinkle a few cloves of minced garlic on top as the sprouts roast, which is delicious--the roasted garlic is sweet and compliments the sprouts without overpowering them. Also, I usually parboil the sprouts first (for 2 minutes).  This draws out bitterness, and cuts down on roasting time (25 minutes to nicely blackened).",

I\u2019ve roasted cauliflower before ---have been experimenting with roasting veggies lately, but let me tell you this was better than any roasted vegetable I\u2019ve ever had.  It\u2019s so simple too it\u2019s ridiculous!  I bought a bag of fresh Brussels sprouts.  I took off the ends ---small leaves come off when you take off the ends.  ~Word of advice do NOT omit those small leaves . . . they turn into deliciousness in your mouth.  I cut only the big Brussels sprouts in half, but next time ----I will cut them all in half.  I tossed them and the fallen leaves into a bowl with liberal oil, liberal sea salt and fresh cracked pepper and placed the halves face down on my cookie sheet.  As it\u2019s cooking the small leaves will turn dark and roast first ---don\u2019t be alarmed . . . those will be wonderful.  I took them out of the oven when they were done and tasted a small leaf first.  That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this.  The concept of roasting is so simple, it\u2019s not really a recipe, but the taste that this vegetable yields . . . it\u2019s at the top of the list of any vegetable I\u2019ve ever had.  We\u2019re carb-free/low carb so I served this with a shoulder roast ----one of the best meals hands down since I can remember.  Hope this review has helped someone out there decide to try it.  Remember ---half all of them face down and toss in those fallen leaves . . . you won\u2019t regret it.",

I did not care for the \"mushy\" or \"creamy\" interior others found so appealing, nor the overroasted exterior. Also, I don't know how you could roast these as long as the recipe indicates without making them little burnt charcoal briquettes...15-20 minutes was more like it.  I found the look of them unappealing too--much prefer the bright color of simply steamed or sauteed brussels sprouts. Hubby liked them better than I did, tho' he might have just wanted to be nice.

Give this one a try. Update!!!! I'm hitting the store tonight for fresh brussels sprouts, This recipe is really ADDICTIVED!!!!. I cook these all the time, this time I decided to use the garlic as others have stated as I really love garlic. Let me say they were still good, but I think much better just following the recipe as stated. I still can't get enough!!!.",
