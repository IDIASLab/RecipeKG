I used pine nuts instead of walnuts since that's what I had lying around and I also added a handful of raisins. After poking around in it dubiously torn between foods they adore and a food they despise each child finally took a bite. The surprised looks on their faces were priceless. This will be a good one to bring to pot lucks or family holiday gatherings (keep the dressing on the side and toss the salad once you get there though).",
