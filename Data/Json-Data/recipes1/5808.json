I even cooked it longer and added addtl cornstarch to thicken but it was very liquidy and VERY bland. I even added some chili powder and a dash of cayenne per other suggestions to spice it up but we were still not happy. \"Louisanna Shrimp Creole\" also found on this site - we think - is much better. Ediable? Yes. But I almost cried as I tossed out the leftovers (alot)...esspecially since shrimp was involved. I wish I could brag this recipe up, but I just can't...but perhaps it would have worked better had I just done the 2 servings (but then, it wouldn't have fed my family). Ahhh, I guess you can't win them all!? Thanks just the same for posting.",

Forgot the parsley. Served it over a brown/wild rice mix and it was fantastic! I discovered that while shrimp is frozen the tail shells pull right off. Will be a regular meal for us. Thanks!",
