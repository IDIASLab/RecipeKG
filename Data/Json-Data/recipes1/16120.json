I added a few more spices in the end because it was a little heavy on the tomato flavor. Including the time to cook the rice and prepare all of the ingredients it actually took closer to an hour (but if you know you're not going to have a lot of time you could prep everything the night before). Still faster than my sister-in-law's Jambalaya recipe!",
