I added extra water to it because as DREGINEK mentioned it was a bit potent and instead of adding black olives I added black beans (which was a nice addition). I think that it could have used a can of mexican diced tomatoes. That would have done it. An O.K. recipe thanks Kristine.",

The taco seasoning - although good-was just too dominant tasting when served as a side by itself. Also I used 2c rice and this thickened to the perfect consistency. I might make this again for either a taco filling or reduce the amt of taco seasonings when served as a side.",
