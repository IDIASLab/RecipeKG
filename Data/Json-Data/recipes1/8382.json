I was reading through the bible and realized that the food \"raisin cake\" was mentioned and eaten alot as part of the hebrew tradition.  So I was inspired to look for a \"raisin cake\" recipe.  Though I'm sure this is not a traditional hebrew recipe, it sure is delectable!!  As another reviewer did, I also made mine in a bundt pan.  Incredibly moist, just enough sweetness to it and so very easy to make.  Thanks for sharing.  I will be making this often.",

When the raisins and water were done boiling i removed them from the heat & put the butter & sugars right into the hot water to melt. I didn't wait for it to cool. Just went ahead and mixed in the flour and other ingredients. We didn't add the nuts. We also sprinkled 10X sugar on top. Came out great will be making again. Thanks",
