(The other half.......who knows?...it does look a bit \"messy\" when you serve it) I made a few \"tweaks\" to this recipe:\r\n1)I cooked the beef, onion, garlic, salt and pepper ahead of time. (Then I was able to drain all the grease and not have that IN the casserole)\r\n2)I used Cream of Mushroom w/ Roasted Garlic soup\r\n3)After pouring the cream/milk mixture I sprinkled cheddar cheese all over it before the layer of Tator Tots.\r\n4)Baked it for only 30 minutes since beef was cooked.\r\nYum! I'd make it again. Very easy and tasty.",

Hot Dishes: you always cook the the meat (whatever kind that may be except tuna) before putting it into the casserole dish. It will not tell you to do this in many hot dish recipes because it is for the most part understood. You should use raw meat in a casserole/hot dish only when the recipe tells you specifically not to cook it before hand. I hope this helps. Great recipe. It is an old common dish that most people will love.",

I actually chopped up about half a large zucchini from my garden and added it to the onions and garlic as they sauteed (before adding the beef to the skillet) mainly just to add a veggie to this dish as it's a meal in itself. It was very delicious! Also after I emptied the can of condensed cream of mushroom soup into the bowl I refilled it all the way with milk instead of just half way. I'm not sure how it would have been with just half the milk but I found the amount of creaminess to be perfect with how I did it. I also did similar to another reviewer and laid some slices of cheddar down- I put mine on top of the soup layer so it actually went: meat soup cheese tater tots. Then upon serving I added a few grates of cheddar on top of the hot dish once it hit the plate. Wonderful! And the kids LOVED it!",
