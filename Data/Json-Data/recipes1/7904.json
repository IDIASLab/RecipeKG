I am Italian and I come from a family of Bakery owners and these cookies impressed them. Thank-you for submitting this recipe and I always make mention as to where and whom this recipe originated from. I highly recommend this recipe for its simplicity and its deliciousness!! Paula",

They still turned out wonderfully. I gave it 5 stars even though I altered it because both my parents are from 100% Italian families & these cookies were much better than our family recipe. Ours are always so hard they should be dunked in coffee. These were cookie-ish yet firm & were a huge hit at my Italian family at Thanksgiving. I followed ingredients as indicated minus the anise (not a fan of anise) and once basic recipe was completed I split into two batches. Batch 1 Almond Biscotti: I added 1.5 t pure almond extract & almonds. Batch 2 Maple Walnut Biscotti: 2 t immitation maple & chopped walnuts. Baking times differ just keep an eye on them. Once cooled I added white & dark chocolate. Yummy!",

I wanted to use dates but forgot to put them in before I started baking so I'll do that next time. I have not made biscotti before so really didn't know what to expect. The dough is quite sticky so I used some whole wheat flour and made my log shapes on the counter then transfered to the ungreased cookie sheet. I used the whole egg wash. The recipe did not call for salt and I used unsalted butter but I will use regular butter next time. When I did the second bake I found laying them flat on the cookie sheet produced a better browning/drying.These were so yummy my hubby even shared with one of his buddies chick food he calls it funny chick food is pretty good. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. It's a real keeper.",
