This is an AWESOME recipe and very easy to make!  I usually omit the pepper but add paprika...People show up to the party just for the cheese straws I think!\r\nI've never had a problem with the dough, but what I do is set my butter out the night before I make these so that the butter is at room temp and very soft, I also put my cheese out a few hours before making them so that it's at room temp and soft.  Also, use freshly shredded sharp or extra sharp cheddar cheese, I made these with packaged shredded cheese and they weren't as good as with freshly shredded cheese.  Takes a but longer but you'll appreciate it in the end!",

After reading the other reviews, I decided to soften my butter a bit in the microwave, then mixed it with the cheese. I added the cayenne and about 1/2 tsp garlic salt to the flour (omitting the salt the recipe called for) before mixing it with the cheese. With the addition of 1/2 cup water, the dough came together well. Instead of greasing a cookie sheet, I used sheets of parchament paper & then my cookie press to press out the straws. I sprinkled them with garlic salt and baked for 8 mins. After removing them from the oven, I slipped the parchament paper off the cookie sheet so the straws could cool more quickly. I cut them in half lengthwise, then across, so the finished product was about 2\" long. I think the key to crispiness is making sure that the oven is preheated properly. My first batch was chewier than subsequent batches.",

Then I dumped it in my mixer bowl, dropped 1 \u00bd sticks of margarine in and popped it in the microwave for 40 seconds. I blended it and added the dry ingredients and put it in my cookie press with the big star tip and squirted straws in rows, the length of the pan. When they came out, I quickly cut them about every 2 inches. Very easy. I did not add the water and they came out absolutely delicious! Very light, crisp and cheesy! I did have to bake them about 12 minutes to get them light brown. If you take them out before that, they are not crisp.If you let them get too brown, they are burned... Have to keep a careful eye on them between 10 and 12 minutes. I definitely added this one to my recipe box. Thanks!\n",
