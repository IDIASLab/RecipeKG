I did up the temperature for the balance of the cooking time - after the ten minutes I reduced the oven to 400F for about 25 minutes. I think the cooking time depends on what pastry crust you use. I was very excited when the judges cut the pie to see that it was juicy but not runny - and I used frozen blueberries that I rinsed in a strainer and left to drain for a while.",

Tapioca produces much better results than cornstarch.  I forgot to add butter to the filling.  There was no adverse effect to the filling.  In the future, I will probably leave this out on purpose to make a dent in the saturated fat.  This is my preferred recipe for blueberry pie.",

Some complained that the pie was runny; to solve this you NEED to let the pie set!! Fruit pies will still be a little runny after baking and need several hours to set. This pie is no exception. I let mine set overnight and it was perfect. Another tip is to make sure you give the blueberries ample time to stand in the mixture (before pouring into the pie crust). You will notice how much it thickens depending on how much time you allow.",
