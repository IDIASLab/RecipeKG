Make sure to use room temperature, washed and thoroughly dried strawberries.  Often I will go to the local specialty market where I can hand pick individual strawberries to get the perfect size and shape.  I bring them home, wash and let them dry.  \r\n\r\nI generally hold mine by the stem into the chocolate and spoon the chocolate over them...I learned from experience that often when dipping them the stem will break off otherwise...so mine are more chocolate covered strawberries than chocolate dipped.  I then place mine on wax paper lined trays.  Sometimes I drizzle mine with some melted white chocolate for an elegant touch.  Then I refrigerate about an hour.  \r\n\r\nBe sure to use high qualtiy chocolate...and no need to add shortening either.  I never liked it that way (some recipes call for it) I personally don't like using it because of the trans fat.\r\n\r\nThey don't last long!  And, they are wonderful for parties!\r\n\r\n",

Wash the berries (they can be sandy) and always dry strawberries (pat with a kitchen towel) or they mush up really fast.2.When you melt chocolate in the microwave, it's easy to burn it if you keep cooking it until it loses its shape. When the chocolate chips look glossy, stir them and micro on in short increments until it stirs smooth.  You have to serve these within the day because the heat from the chocolate makes the berries skin go squishy before long. :)",

This dried on beautifully with a good crunch. Used semi-sweet and would recommend staying with bitter or semi. The sweetness of dark or milk chocolate overpowers the fruit and makes it taste bitter. That's why bitter or semi works so well. My husband and children devoured these and husband asked if I'd  bought them or made them. He thought I spent ages on them. What a keeper.

Dip each strawberry into tempered white chocolate (either completely or just the side you will be presenting face up). Allow these to dry. Next dip both sides (on the left and right of the white chocolate) in your choice of tempered dark bittersweet or milk chocolate to create a V of white chocolate in the center. Using either a piping bag with a tiny tip or parchment piping bag pipe a tiny bowtie at the top of the white chocolate and two or three buttons with the chocolate of your choice. Note: Tempering can be very intimidating but you will be well rewarded for taking the extra time if you plan on eating these at room temperature (you get the full flavor of the strawberry this way). Otherwise just melt the chocolate and keep the strawberries refrigerated until serving. Enjoy!",
