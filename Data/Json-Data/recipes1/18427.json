I was searching for a chicken based pasta dish that was not the norm, this fit the bill and will become a regular dish in my house. I followed the recipe pretty close except doubled the meat. I used pepperoncinis and sweet yellow bell peppers (on-hand). Asiago and Romano cheeses. Marsala can make some dishes a little too sweet for my blood so  I used Merlot. It came out GREAT. It was my 1st Chef John but wont be my last.",

We followed the recipe as written since we\u2019ve not eaten chicken riggies before and wanted to taste something resembling the local version (an image search using a search engine shows numerous versions based on \u2018tweaks\u2019 by different cooks). Used red, yellow and orange sweet peppers, along with 2 jalapenos. The creamy tomato sauce was spicy with moderate heat for our tastes. The sauce seemed to be about the right consistency in step 2 when it called for adding water if needed. The water was not added to avoid a runny sauce (btw, the video version is correct but the AR edited written version is in error by saying to add water to thicken the sauce as it will thin it). After adding the pasta in the final step, what liquid existed in the sauce was quickly absorbed. Next time, I would add 1-1/2 cups chicken broth and not be concerned about the sauce looking runny in step 2. This is another excellent recipe by Chef John.",

I didn't have marsala so I used white wine and therefore got the wine and the water mixed up and put the water in when the wine was supposed to go in. Sigh. I drank the 1/2 cup of wine and all was good. I left out olives because I hate them. Other than that made it as written and was great.

                "reviewBody": "I figured I would try this recipe to switch my usual riggie recipe up a bit figured the sausage and Marsala wine would be an interesting twist. Boy was I wrong. The sausage overpowers everything and the kalamata olives clash with the flavor of the sauce leaving an awful flavor on the back of your tongue. Remove the sausage and replace the kalamata olives with black olives and this recipe might be decent.",
