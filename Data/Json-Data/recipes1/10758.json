I also served broccoli along with it. It was a nice presentation. Since so many commented on the sweetness, I cut the sugar in half. I used pineapple in its own juice, NOT the kind that has the sweetened syrup. It turned out fine...not sweet at all. I also cut the butter in half. Next time I would use just two tablespoons. I could still taste a bit of greasiness, although not bad.  I followed the directions and used a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. If you want to taste these, you will have to use more than a  pinch. We could not detect either spice in the casserole. Many reviewers said it was too eggy for them. So I used three eggs and 1/4 cup of milk. It turned out well. Cooking time was right on. I used a 2 1/2 quart casserole. It was a nice change from potatoes. Everyone who ate it, enjoyed it.",

If making this in a 9x13 pan, you will need more like 8 slices of bread in the mixture, so once its baked, it puffs up more like a stuffing, otherwise it will be too runny.  I also cube my bread, don't think that matters as much.  I also bake mine at 350 for 40 min. and that does the trick....I think 60 min. is too long.  Enjoy, this is excellent!",
