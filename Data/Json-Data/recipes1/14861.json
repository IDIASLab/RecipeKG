Anyone can make it without going wrong--one should only try it once to see how simple it is. Serve hot with sliced onion rounds, lime or lemon wedges, and garnish it with cilantro or parsley. Can also serve any dipping sauce of your choice.",

That translates to a meal for 2 to me. I made as written but used chicken breast tenderloins instead. There is just the 2 of us so I still used it as a meal but tenderloins are the way to go if you are wanting an appetizer. Cut into pieces would be even better but.... Easy and good but the ginger was overkill. I recommend cutting it in half. I will say that it is very moist and stayed tender.",
