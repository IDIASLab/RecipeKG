And for the salsa I used Salsa de Tomatillo, recipe also from this site, and I already knew he wasn't a big fan of that either.  As for me?  I used low carb tortillas, which I'ver never tried before, and I thought I'd be \"cheated.\" It seemed like this dinner would be a bust for both of us. I used some shredded rotisserie chicken I had in the freezer and I had these assembled and in the oven in no time.  And there's cerrtainly no need to measure anything.  I didn't mix the cheese in with the chicken mixture, just threw a handful on each tortilla before rolling them up.  I especially liked the addition of the green onion and the fresh cilantro, both of which contributed great flavor as well as a freshness. To my surprise, we both loved 'em!  Hubs said he REALLY ENJOYED tonight's dinner and, for the record, I found that low carb tortillas really aren't bad!  I served them the way we like them, with shredded lettuce, chopped tomato, a little extra cheese, guacamole and a plotch of sour cream (along with some zucchini I coarsely chopped and sauteed with bacon, garlic, onion, and chopped jalapeno peppers).",
