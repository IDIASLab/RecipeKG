You can find gluten at any health store and some grocery stores in the baking isle where flour is. When you bake bread w/ 100% WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR you're missing out on the gluten which is found in white flour....so it's best to add it for a nice fluffy high risen bread! Thanks for the recipe....also.... if I had honey (which I'm out of!) I would omit sugar and replace w/ honey instead (same amts). -Sharon",

I kneeded it some when it came out and put it in a bread pan, let it rise till double in size. Forgot about it and it rose a LOT above the pan. Still came out very good, but way too tall to fit in the toaster!!! All my family loved it. I did add the 1/4 cup gluten flour also. I am going to try to make hamburger buns next. If you are going to eat bread, it must be 100% whole wheat or from what the nutritionists say, you are eating a slice of sugar. Thanks for the recipe.\n6/11/07 I have been making this bread almost every day now. When I have all the ingred. out, I make bread baggies with all the dry ingredients in each baggies except for the flour. Now I only have to put the water in the bread machine, add the 3 cups flour, pour in my baggie of dry ingred., add butter, pop in the bread machine, set for ww dough and in two hours I can plop it in a bread pan, let it rise for about 45 min and bake at 350 for about 25--30 minutes. This is the only bread my 1-1/2 year old grandaughter wants to eat :) Gotta go make bread, thanks...\np.s. If you want to use honey, just don't add the sugar to the bread baggies and add it when you add butter:)",
