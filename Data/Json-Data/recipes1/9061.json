I made some changes that I think compliment its simple style: First I too used canned mandarin oranges and added about 2 tbsp of that liquid to the dressing which sort of cut through the vinegar nicely. I also added some chopped avocado crumbled blue cheese and smokehouse almonds to the salad - totally divine combinations! I also used spring mix as did another reviewer. For the dressing I substituted Raspberry vingegar with some Fig Vinegar I had in the house and that worked perfectly. Thanks so much! I've already made this salad twice this week - and it's only Wednesday.:-)",
