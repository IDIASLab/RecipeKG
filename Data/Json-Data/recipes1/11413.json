So I decided to see what else could be done and found this recipe. I cut them in half & de-seeded them; it doesn't specifically say to do that but I thought the description seemed to bear this idea out. I didn't drain mine at the end and the sauce as it cools gels into...well jelly. The flavor can best be described as orange marmalade. We ate it over slices of pound cake and I thought it was a great recipe! Thanks!",

I made this recipe as written but when they finished cooking I saved half to eat like the recipe suggest and the other half I blended up with my hand-held blender to use as a jam. For me personally the next time I will add less sugar because now they are very sweet and as I mentioned above the tartness is what I love about them. I saved the liquid that was drained off and added some of it to a smoothie and used the rest in place of the cold water when I made jello. Nothing wasted! I really like this recipe and will try it again. Thanks for sharing.",
