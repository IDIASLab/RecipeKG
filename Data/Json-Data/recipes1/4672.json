I got a plate and sprinkled breadcrumbs and placed the chicken on it and rolled it from there.  I also added a pat of butter on top of each.  It came out beautifully and you must use the sauce (which is 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1 tbsp of lemon juice).  I put a bed of white rice on the plates, put the chicken cordon blue on top of the rice covered with the cream sauce. A good side dish is buttered rolls, mmm-mhmm!

I have to say, this recipe made me 'Queen for a Day.' I also dipped the chicken in egg before sprinkling the bread crumbs, and I, too, added a small pat of butter on top of each of the breasts. I will definetely be making this, at least once a month. I used the 'potatoe rounds' recipe from this site, for the side dish. This entire meal turned out soooooooo good. You are a goddess, Kiersten!

Final suggestion: add the honey-mustard sauce from this site's Aussie Chicken recipe (inside the roll and/or as a dipping sauce). It really complements this dish!",

My boyfriend and I were going to go out to dinner for his birthday and the night before, he decides, he wants a homecooked meal from yours truly instead. I freaked out and googled what to make. He then suggested \"steak, lobster or chicken cordon bleu\" He knew I was NOT making steak or lobster :) Don't laugh (i've been living under a rock) but I had no idea what chicken cordon bleu even was! I have cooked before but honestly, before I made this, I had NEVER made a meal (from scratch) by myself.  Again, don't laugh!
