I pictured people walking through the store searching for polenta to add to the water...anyway, 3 parts water, one part cornmeal, and you have polenta.  It take minutes to make before it thickens so don't be surprised based on the instructions.  I like to chill mine a few hours then cut and grill it and top it with pasta sauce, grilled veggies and parm.  yum!",

Italian Delicatessens and probably some upscale markets do sell a product called 'Polenta' which is considerably more coarse than ordinary Corn Meal.

Some people may need salt but it tasted just fine. Turned it our into an 8x8 pan to cool so it would have some shape.
