Hubby didn't like the corn on the pork and I wasn't too thrilled with the creamed corn. The corn was a little bit soupy and didn't stand up well. I ended up browning the pork just a minute on each side before baking in the oven which reduced the cooking time by about 20 minutes. I don't know if this is something I will try again but thank you for the post.",

And the creammed corn was so runny looking that my hubby wouldnt touch any of it. I myself only ate the pork. On to my point the pork was very very tender and juicy. I say it is a great way to make pork because so often pork gets really dry. Nexty time I make it I will cook in the corn and then throw the corn away before my hubby sees it. It really did look like a gloppy mess. I know he will like the tender pork the corn yields though.",
