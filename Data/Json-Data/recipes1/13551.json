Also I would recommend not putting too many in the pan. I did not leave any space in between the bundles so the bacon only got crispy on the top.

(the green bean bundles with brown sugar are too) I find that it is easiest to keep a smaller container full of these marinating at all times. This helps to have them on hand for those nights when we want them and I had not planned ahead.(like a busy mom has time for that!) When I cook them I use the 2 cans that were marinated so I just replace them with 2 more. I never liked green beans until I discovered this recipe from my aunt. They are really addictive!!
