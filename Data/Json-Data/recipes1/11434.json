It is not like the typical German Sauerbraten found in American \"German\" restaurants.

That's what you get in Southern Germany and Austria when you order Sauerbraten.  Once you try it, you will forever love it!",

She adds juniper berries removed after meat has marinated and you MUST marinate the meat for at least 3 days and it's better if you marinate for 4 or 5 days. She does not add tomato wedges either. After removing the bay leaves cloves and juniper berries she thickens the gravy then strains it through a fine sieve mashing the onions through the sieve to add body to the gravy (I think she uses 2 or 3 onions too). Her Sauerbraten is the best I've ever had and I've never met its match (I haven't been able to completely re-create it either). The purpose of the marinade is to make a tough cut of meat tender and palatable. Other recipes suggest adding gingersnaps raisins or sugar sweeteners being a common thing for Northern Germans but I've never cared for that version of Sauerbraten. The recipe is great as is but try my suggested additions/changes and see if you like it better the way my German mother makes Sauerbraten!",
