The cake was overdone on the top and the exterior was rather chewy. I had to take it out at 50 minutes as it was starting to burn. I am going back to the pre-heated oven. 9/17:Wow, this is fabulous! I used a Duncan Hines butter yellow cake mix plus used 3 bananas, added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 cup of sour cream. This was so very moist and so tasty!!! Delicious! I baked for 40 min in a preheated oven and it was perfect! Thanks so much for an easy and tasty cake!",

Made a frosting of 1 tub of coolwhip, 1 small pkg of bananacream instant pudding and 1 cup of milk. Sprinkled chopped walnuts on frosting. Took to a dessert pot luck and everyone loved it.

I made a cream cheese frost: 1 pckg Cream cheese, 1 C butter, 2C confectioner's sugar and 1-2 Tsp vanilla extract.  I put this in the fridge while the cake was baking.  I let the cake cool, then I cut it in half and put 1/3 of the frost on one half of the cake, then I had frozen blueberries, rasberries and strawberries that I put over the frost. then I put the other  1/3 of frost over the fruit. I put the other half over this and covered it with the rest of the frost and grated toblerone dark chocolate over it. tastes like a million dollars after chilling 1 hour in the fridge. thanks its yummmmmy",

This really fits the bill, and I was pleasantly surprised how good it came out.  It smells wonderful while cooking.  I pre-heated the oven and baked for 40 minutes which was perfect.  I did add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 cup choc chips.  I agree with another reviewer, I don't think it needs the chocolate chips, so I won't be doing that again.  It is sweet enough to not need a frosting but is really good with also.  I am so glad I found this recipe and highly recommend it.  We couldn't wait for it to cool in the fridge, we ate it warm from the oven :)  Update:  I made this with a Butter Pecan cake mix and it was just as good, if not better. Tip: if you're short on bananas, you can throw in one of those little applesauce cups (I've done this when I've only had 2 bananas, makes the batter thinner but the cake still turns out great in the end, very moist).",

I was a little nervous about using fresh bananas (I didn't have any ripe ones on hand) But to my surprise it came out AWESOME!!! It tasted like I spent a ton of time and ingredients on it which is not the truth at all!! I would recommend this recipe to anyone that enjoys banana cake or bread because you just cant beat how good and easy this one is! I will be making this cake from here on out!",

I followed one reviewer's recommendation and used three bananas instead of two, and it made it even more moist.  I would not try using four bananas, though.  It definitely did not need a frosting because it is so good as is.  Next time I may try a chocolate cake mix and may stir in some chocolate chips or chopped toasted walnuts to make it even yummier.  :)  One word of caution:  I checked my cake after 54 minutes, and the top looked very brown, although this did not affect the taste.  I would recommend checking after 50 minutes of baking and test for doneness with a toothpick.  This is a perfect dessert to take to any pot-luck function because it is easy to transport also!",
