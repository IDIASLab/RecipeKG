They remind me of a seven layer bar but the cherries are a wonderful addition. I followed other reviewers by combining the crumbs with the butter and then pressing the crust into a foil lined pan. After baking I cooled to room temperature and then refrigerated overnight to set up. I let it sit for about 30 minutes before cutting and they came right off the foil. These not only taste great but they are so pretty especially for the holiday season.",
