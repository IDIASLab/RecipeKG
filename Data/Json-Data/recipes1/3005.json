My only problem was with the frosting; I'm unfamiliar with caramelizing sugar and although I succeeded in getting it to turn \"golden \" getting it out of the pan into the sugar/butter/cream mixture was a challenge. I ended up spilling a small amount of the hot mixture into the stuck caramel and stirring like crazy to loosen and dissolve it - it worked but I was nervous about burning the OTHER mixture while working it free. The end result was worth it though - a perfectly spiced cake with a lovely golden frosting that looked quite festive with my red & green sprinkle white chocolate nonpareils. Thanks Barbara!",
