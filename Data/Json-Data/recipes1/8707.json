The only change I made was to use an 8\" skillet of cornbread (in the South we don't use cornbread mix lol) I think it needs just a slight bit of tweaking to be perfect. #1--is mushy, so I think the cooking temp should be brought up to at least 350\u00ad\u00b0 & possibly reduce the broth by 1/2 - 1 cup; #2--needs a bit more sage flavor, next time I will either increase sage by 1 tsp or use sage flavored sausage. (p.s..for those leaving out the green bell pepper, you are missing out on some great flavor,  just chop it really fine & you will not know it is there)\r\n\r\nUpdate:  I remade this recipe; I decreased the chicken broth to 3 cups, upped the sage to 1 tablespoon, used sage sausage, & upped the cooking temp to 350.  IMHO those changes have made the dressing perfect (& now 5 star rated).",

I left in all the seasonings the recipe called for,even though the bread crumbs were seasoned(the only thing I reduced was the salt). Needless to say, everyone raved and had seconds and thirds.

The preservatives in the mix give the \"stove top\" \"right from the box\" taste that some have complained about.  Buy good quality, stone-ground corn meal, (Bob's Red Mill, etc) follow the simple recipe on the bag, and you will be so pleased with the flavor of your cornbread that you will never buy a mix again.  Make a large enough batch that some of the cornbread can be the cook's breakfast while the rest goes into the stuffing. \n Warm buttered cornbread makes getting up in the wee hours to prepare the holiday feast much more enjoyable.\n(if you are a baker, make your own baguettes or whole wheat bread for the white bread portion of the recipe.  I freeze a leftover baguettes and bread \"heels.\"  Double wrapped, they keep frozen for 3 months.  You then eliminate all the bread preservatives and your stuffing will really taste like \"Grandmother used to make.\")",

Cut it into cubes and then let it sit out over night) and added extra sage.  It was delicious and the crowd was very pleased.  Texture was moist (not dry or too wet) and hearty enough to chew.
