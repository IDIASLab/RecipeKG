I would cut them down to 16 oz. instead of 24. I also added 2c. more cheese because someone else said it was more macaroni and tomatoes than mac n cheese. I'm glad I did because it was better cheesier. I also browned the beef with a little pepper and garlic salt for flavor. I think maybe next time I will use a little less juice (since I will use less macaroni) 6c. not 4 of cheese and also add some italian seasoning. Maybe using v8 or spicy v8 instead would also kick it up a notch? Anyway I liked it and it's a good versatile recipe you can play with or use as is. My toddler loved it and ate like a piggy!",

I also added another 1/2 bag of cheese and even added some cream cheese to make it even creamier. I added some chili powder which I think was a mistake. That or the cream cheese. I think simply adding garlic and onion powder with a little salt would have done much better.",

Our family of 6 ate it for dinner lunch the next day and lunch the day after that!!! My husband and I thought it was OK. Will make again in a smaller batch as my children enjoyed it.",

We have eaten it twice and still have alot left. I used the mild Rotel tomatoes. It was a little spicy but my husband said he liked it that way. I used 6 cups of cheese instead of 4 and loved that. Next time I will use more ground beef because I think that will enhance it even more. But seriously if you make this recipe even with the 16 oz of noodles please put it in a bigger pan than is called for or it will boil over in your oven like mine did.",

Also the cheese in the ingredients is measured in cups whereas in the directions it says \"one package of the grated cheese\".
