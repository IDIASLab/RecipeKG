                "reviewBody": "I've read through the reviews, and some people say it doesn't have much flavor, except for the quality of the cheeses you buy (and good cheese is expensive). Reading the recipe as it's written, I can see why people have said this - there is no \"underscore\" for the sauce. An easy way to fix this is to realize that you're basically making a white sauce, and adding cheese to it. Well, the recipe calls for 2 cups of half-and-half. That means, you can add 2 bouillon cubes of your choice to the sauce (look at step 2) while the sauce is simmering - make sure you crumble the bouillon cubes well, so that the spices are incorporated into the sauce. I would suggest a good chicken bouillon, like Maggi or Knorr - and for the vegetarians that DO eat cheese and eggs, you can add 2 vegetable bouillon stock cubes instead of the chicken. Hope this helps! P.S. I would also suggest adding whole milk only, instead of half-and-half. The sauce would be almost as creamy, but your guests wouldn't be bogged down with all those calories from the cheese!",
