This recipe has the makings of a good dish, but you really need to play around with it. Thank you Cat!",

I used kraft sharp cheddar cheese in the block- no need to shred just slice it thin. I used almost the whole 8oz block of cheese since I doubled the sauce. I think the kraft sharp cheddar cheese tastes best -better tasting than the already shredded packs of cheese. I also used frozen peas. Served my family of 5 and still have leftovers for next day lunch. I will make this again. A keeper! Thank you!",
