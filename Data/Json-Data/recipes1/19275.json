It was different, but yummy too, I'm not sure what they used to bring it all together? Now I try to do a healthier spin & all fresh ingredients...apples; pineapple;oranges;plain Greek yogurt; (flavored by me w/vanilla & truvia)a touch of mini-marshmallows;fresh or frozen cherries;I put in fridge long enough for flavors to play nice. Then add nuts & coconut before serving.It's just as tasty, but I think a bit healthy then old school recipes. Thanks for the memory...",
