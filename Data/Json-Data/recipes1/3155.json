The children in my classes have never messed up a batch of these cookies in the fourteen years I've been teaching kindergarten, and neither have my four adorable children.

Too wet? Too dry? I think it s the MIXING method that makes a difference. If you mix this like a group of kindergartners would dump and mix by hand it should turn out just fine. If you are using an electric stand mixer you might have to make some changes to get it to work. My first shot at this recipe was using a KitchenAid stand mixer and my results were less than ideal. The dough looked nice and rolled out pretty well but it was impossible to get the cut shapes off of the floured surface without destroying them even repeatedly flouring the surface and re-rolling wasn t cutting it they just stuck down and fell apart. In an attempt to salvage the batch I put the whole ball back into the mixer and added another 1/4 Cup of flour. Perfect! It rolled out well and cut well on a floured surface and the cookies turned out great. Second try was by hand to see if my theory about mixing held true and it did. The original recipe worked just fine when mixed by hand with a good old-fashioned wooden spoon. I floured the table and rolling pin heavily and repeatedly while rolling and cutting. Stick with the simpler forms like Christmas trees and snowmen not reindeer with skinny legs the dough is a bit fragile. Cookies are soft and puffy like the ones you get at the bakery with the super-sweet frosting on the",
