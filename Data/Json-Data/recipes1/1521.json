Sometimes I use water that I have drained off potatoes that I have cooked the night before for dinner, no need to actually add the potato to the recipe, only the potato water; it is what helps keep the whole wheat bread lighter. I also now use instant yeast and just mix it in with the flour.  Only need two risings, one initial and then one after you form the loaves and place in the bread pans.  The changes to the recipe make it healthier and faster.  Happy bread baking.",
