I cut into 3/4 slices that were deep enough to create the shallow hallow for the filling. The instructions say to cut a slice of bread into triangles but if you use the standard-size sandwich bread the triangles would be tiny. This was OK it pretty much just tastes like egg salad (not necessarily a bad thing) but I m not sure what purpose the cream cheese served as opposed to mayonnaise. Bottom line I was expecting more flavor and did end up adding a few more olives and some salt to ramp up the flavor.",
