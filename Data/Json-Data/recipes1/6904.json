My version is it a bit different as I add some dry mustard to dressing (make sure you mix your mayo, oil and vinegar well...this helps keep the coating adhered to the potatoes) then I add in a chopped hard boil egg.  Also, if you quarter your potatoes, boil them till done (not mushy though) cool them a bit, the skins come off easily and you can cut them into bit size chunks. The flavor of the potato is better if you cook them with the skins on.",

Even people who said they didn't like potato salad in general had to try some just from the raves everyone else was giving it!  \r\n\r\nBe warned though, I nibbled on it just after making it - before it had time to sit for 24 hours - and I thought it would be horrible.  I even went out and bought store-brand deli potato salad thinking I couldn't serve this at my party.  It was amazing the difference some time in the fridge made!!  Once the flavors had a chance to combine, this was the best potato salad I have had in a long time - I will definitely be making it again!",
