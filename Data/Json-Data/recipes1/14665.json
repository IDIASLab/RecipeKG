I liked the idea of using FRESH ingredients. I used fresh green beans instead of \"frozen\" I boiled water, put plenty of salt and butter in the pot before adding the green beans and blanched them for about 10 min or so. the time depends on how you like your green beans. I dont like mines too soggy/mushy. I used just regular mushrooms that already came sliced/cleaned and sauteed them with the onions before adding the other ingredients. I omitted the lemon and accidently forgot to add the parsley although I did buy it. This was a hit. I was unsure of how this was going to turn out so I didnt make a lot. After seeing how fast it went, I wished I had. :) I'll be making this on a regular dinner night.",

As my boyfriend says bacon makes everything better. being a vegetarian myself I wasn't able to taste this for myself but I will say that this dish is literally the ONLY leftovers he has eaten....everyday since thanksgiving. Thanks for the awesome recipe something tells me I'll be making this a lot sooner than next thanksgiving!!! also i added the milk before stirring in the flour because the butter was not enough liquid to prevent the flour from clumping...this dish is GREAT!!!!",
