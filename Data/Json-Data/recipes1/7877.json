I did like that mozzerella was sprinkled on then melted on top of the tomatoes. It kept the tomatoe mixture in place while you bit into it. I made this for my dad for dinner tonight and he thought it was great, even though he's not a big bruschetta fan. I will definately use this recipe again.",

I did make a couple of previously suggested changes; added a tablespoon of olive oil and a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. I tried it two ways; both with a little butter added before toasting and without and it was better without the addition of butter. I used slices of cheese and think they would be better than using shredded. Loved it so much that I plan on making it as soon as the menu would allow it!! Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
