I substituted butternut squash for the acorn squash and added dried crushed sage leaves instead. Like others I could definately finish a whole lot of this at a time. Based on other reviewers' suggestions I cooked the potato and onion alone for 10 minutes then added the squash mushroom and bell pepper and cooked for an additional 10 minutes. Finally I added the remaining vegetable and cooked the final 5 minutes. So good! A keeper of a recipe and a great starting point for making your own vegetable hash recipe.",

The diced red pepper on the other hand I withheld until the last five minutes or so. I substituted some of the giant puffball Kathy Turner gave us for the shitakes and a leek for the shallot; added some frozen \"meat\"balls (my wife's vegetarian)for protein's sake; and I served this with some grated cheese to go on top as a main dish. Delish! This is an amazing festive autumn treat even without the giant puffball. In fact we enjoyed this so much that I'm cooking it again tonight (for the second night running). Still some giant puffball left but this time I'll substitue fish sausage (she's a pesce-vegetarian) for the \"meat\"balls and adding Kathy's green beans to the melange.",

I don't think Martha Stewart and a room full of assistants could peel, and dice an acorn squash, a pound of yukon potatoes, 8 oz of mushrooms, a cup of kale, a bell pepper and finely dice a shallot -- in 15 minutes. Seriously? No Way. I'm pretty efficient when it comes to dicing, but I was making this dish for a dinner group at 5:00 p.m. and I began shortly after 2:00 p.m. If my husband had not joined me and worked side by side for 45 minutes, there is no way it would have been ready. There was no instruction on how to peel an acorn squash- so I\u2019ll add that I scrub the squash well, prick holes in it like you would a baked potato, then microwave it for about 3 minutes. Then it is soft enough to peel. Once you peel, you can slice then dice. I also saw no instructions on what to do with or when to add the sage. How much is a \u201cSprig\u201d of fresh sage? I took 4 nice sized leaves and cut in small pieces with kitchen shears. It was not nearly enough to taste. The flavor seemed very bland, and even with additional olive oil and butter, it kept sticking, so I did as another reviewer suggested and added 2 chicken bouillon cubes to one cup of water and it finally began to have some flavor. If you really like these ingredients, please try the recipe, just know it will take a lot longer than 15 minutes to prepare. For me, the end result was not worth the",

I used 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I made this a second time for guests and everyone loved it! I added sweet potatoes for half of the potatoes about 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper instead of a pinch and 2 cups kale. This will be a regular recipe for us!",
