I must say that I did add salt and pepper to the mushrooms while I saut\u00e9ed them. I only had shredded mild Cheddar cheese so I used it. The flavor was good and definitely I would recommend to add salt and pepper as others suggest. This recipe in my opinion could be made better tasting by using shredded Gruy\u00e8re cheese. It's mild tangyness will boost this entire recipe to a five star one.",
