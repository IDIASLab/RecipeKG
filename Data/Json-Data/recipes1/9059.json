Unfortuantly i did not have enough time to properly marinate the chicken I only had 3 hours I did 2 of them in the fridge and the other one on the counter top. Adding the lime zest was a bad idea the flavor took over the honey helped to form a crust on the outside of the chicken (i used the Forman grill) but alas the flavor was still all on the outside of the chicken. My blender was out of operation so I used the ol' micro-plane and a whisk it worked just as good. I will make this dish again and give the meat a full 24 hour marinade.",

I used (because it's what I had) orange juice lemon juice oregano oil and tabasco sauce to marinate it in. I dumped everything into a Zip loc bag shook it up and froze it. I thawed it today then cooked on the stove in the marinade. WOW. It was soooo good. Next time the ONLY thing I'll change is I'm going to cut up the breasts into about half what they were today so they get a better sticky coating.",

I also listened to reviews and added Balsamic Vinegar and honey. Which was ok but I think the vinegar took over the taste. I only had 5-6 hours so I perced the chicken with a fork numberous times so the marinade soaked al the way through faster which worked great. Next time I won't add the vinager and will add about 1 tsp honey and did increase the hot pepper sauce to 1 1/2 T. These portions are for this recipe not the increased portions that I did. Will definatly cook this again!",

I took the marinade and made a sauce by adding about 1/8 cop of water and heating it until boiling for about 30 seconds. Pouring this over the rice and chicken saved the minced garlic (my wife and I love garlic) and it kept the chicken a little more flavorful and moist. Overall a very good meal. Thanks!",
