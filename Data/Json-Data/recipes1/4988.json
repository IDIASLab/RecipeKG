I followed the suggestion of adding an extra banana and using the banana butter icing from this site, but the dough was way too thin for cookies so I added 1 c. of quick oats as well.  I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar just because I like cookies with brown sugar.  The end result was phenomenal.  I actually only iced half of them because my family liked them plain as well.  They taste like muffin tops!",

So good!! Oh- Also added pecans and walnuts!! But make alot they disappear quickly. Another thing- No need for icing just dust with powdered sugar it will be all the sweetness you need. Edit:The only bad thing about these is the tops get moist and soggy. Dont stack them on top of each other they get very sticky.",
