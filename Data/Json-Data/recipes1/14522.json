When youre making the patties big after you formed them make a indentation in the center of the burger with all your fingers (kind of like a birds nest) this way when you cook them on the grill they wont shrink. They will stay the same size and they wont dry out. You wont be disappointed.",

Instead of water I used lactose-free skim milk. I don't know what difference it made but I thought I'd try it. Did a bit extra ketchup and mustard using the spicy brown variety. I mixed the green onions (sliced) right into the burgers. I didn't have pepperjack cheese so I used mozzarella. I'm sure pepperjack would have been better and unfortunately I had no avocado! I love avocados on my burgers so that's what drew me to the recipe. This is really easy and great with macaroni or potato salad.",
