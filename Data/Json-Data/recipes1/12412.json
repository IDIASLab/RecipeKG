Firstly, you got to cook pieces of chicken breast in coconut milk--you can add some water--depends on how thick you like.  Secondly, put 3-5 pieces of lemon grass (2 inches each), 3-5 pieces of galanga (0.5 centimeters thick), 3-5 kaffir lime leaves (we called it bai-ma-grood), lemon or lime juice, fish sauce, crushed fresh chilli, coasly chopped cilantro, mushroom or cabbage.  The taste will be a bit sour, salty and spicy.  You can buy all ingredients in asian food shop.  Don't put ginger because \"Ka\" in thai means galanga.  Those two are look alike, but their smell are totally different.  We eat Tom Ka Gai with rice and when you eat it don't eat lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and galanga.  We put it for smell not eat.",

I used 1 reg and one lite coconut milk. Skipped the oil, added some chili paste for extra spice. Omitted the bok choy and used green onions. I used half water and half chicken broth.  Don't forget to serve with rice.  Tastes as good as the recipe from my Thai cookbook. UPDATE: I have since made this with bok choy and did not like it as much, and I love bok choy.  Also, if your soup tastes \"flat\" you need to add a squeeze of lime juice to brighten all the flavors.  The lemongrass should be bruised, give it a bash with the flat side of a knife or smack with your rolling pin, and NOT chopped or consumed.",

I omitted the fish sauce (unable to find any) and had to use dried lemongrass from a spice jar because I couldn't find fresh (I live in a semi-rural area). Per previous comments I substituted chicken broth for the water and reduced the red pepper by half. It was still quite tangy so next time I'll probably reduce the red pepper further. I added a little extra bok choy and cilantro. Thanks for the recipe!!",

First off DON'T add more that 1 cup of chicken broth thats wayyyy too much and far more salt than necessary. I used 3 cups of water and 1 cup of reduced fat chicken broth. The flavor was just awesome. Also ADD MUSHROOMS! They blend with the flavor so well and really add something special to the recipe. I used a combination of white and brown. We also used 3 small chicken breasts more to chomp on:D If you don't have peanut oil just add 1 tsp peanut butter to the oil you have. With these modifications I find it to be perfect best soup I have ever tasted. Don't skimp on the ginger its fantastic! Great recipe I highly HIGHLY recommend.",

First of all 2 tsp. of crushed red pepper would ruin the dish. I used 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper and the soup was still very spicy. Second 1/4 cup fish sauce is too much. I used 3 Tbsp. and still found it overwhelming. Third 10 ounces of coconut milk is not enough. I would recommend reducing the amount of water and using one-and-a-half or two 15-ounce cans of light coconut milk. I did not find the bok choy a necessary ingredient and instead I would add rice noodles. With these changes I will probably make this recipe again.",
