The recipe calls for an 8 oz. can, which I've never seen in the stores.  I've always bought a 14 oz. can.  I used approximately half of a 14 oz. can. I also used a Jiffy corn muffin mix, which happens to weigh 8.5 oz.  I believe that this is what the recipe submitter intended since the directions mentions cornmeal mix.  I followed the directions on the back of the package (1/3 cup milk and 1 egg) and then added the corn, pepper-Jack cheese, and green chiles.  1/2 cup of milk would be too much.  No added sugar needed if using the Jiffy mix since it is plenty sweet. Moist but still able to eat with hands.",

For others who can't find it, the 8.5 oz. package works out to about 1-1/2 cups, to which you need to add 3-3/4 teaspoons of baking powder.  I will be going back to the other recipe I have been using.  Wish this would have worked out better, because I really like green chiles in my corn bread.",
