I've made it twice and did it the same both times. Good flavor. But I have issues with the recipe itself. Potatoes do NOT get done in 30 seconds in a microwave. And they need stirred. Next time I'll just boil them in water as it seems easier. And I can use the same pan I make the chowder in. Speaking of which this is also a waste of pans. I cooked the bacon in the same pan & just set it aside on a plate. (Easier to wash than another pan. And extra bacon grease can be wiped out easily enough before moving on.) So same pan all the way through and much easier to deal with. And bouillon cubes don't really dissolve in cold milk that easily. Easier to use the grandule kind and dump in w/everything else & it'll dissolve fine. I think the end results are well worth it but it's not a last-minute supper as one person said. Too many steps involved. The taste got a 4 but I dumped it to a 3 due to the convoluted recipe.",

I added some flour and added 4 c. fat free chix broth and let that simmer until taters were tender. I added about 1c. frozen white corn and 2c. fat free half and half old bay seasoning and 4 cans of crab meat. Let that simmer and I did use a little cornstarch and water to thicken a little more.
