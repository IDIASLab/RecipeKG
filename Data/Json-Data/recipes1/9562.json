Added the rice once it was done and put the whole thing in the oven.  I have oven safe pots so I skipped the casserole dish.  Also topped with cheddar cheese.  Excellent dish!",

In addition to the 1/4c salsa, I added 1/3c taco sauce to make it a little creamier, used macaroni noodles instead of egg noodles and mixed in about 1/2c of sharp cheddar cheese in with it all. Apprx 5 minutes before completion, I sprinkled another 1/2c cheese overall to melt.  Very tasty and hearty lunch. Warmed us up in this frigid MN weather we're having here! Thanks Sara.",

I even printed it out and added it to my recipe box with all my grandma's old recipes.\r\n\r\n9-22-05\r\nTried this recipe again last night and used Campbells Chunky Chilli.  This dish came out with very little flavor.  I would not recommend using Campbells Chilli use Nally's or store brands even Aldi's chilli.  I have used many different types of Chilli and this recipes works, but not with Campbells.  \r\n",

I also added some corn chips on top to give it a bit of texture. Then when I served it I added a dallop of sour cream. Made it a lot more flavorful and a bit spicier. :)",

I left out the celery and the salsa (because I didn't have any) and exchanged the egg noodles for two chopped potatoes since neither I or my husband are big egg noodle fans. Because I put in the potatoes I upped the cooking time to about 45 minutes and upped the oven temp to about 350. The result was a hearty meal a little thicker than chili but with the same great flavor. It actually seemed better warmed up the next day than right after it was cooked.
