I've never made a \"quick bread\" without eggs so I got nervous and added one..... it came out fine..... The recipe may look odd but it turns out nice. I think the general idea of this cake especially without the egg.... is for a honey spicey cakey brownie..... chewy and dense like a brownie...... very yummy..... I iced mine with a simple sugar (confectioners sugar) icing... although its sweet enought without it. I also ommitted the candied fruit and added rasisins and almonds..... I also think this cake would be nice with nothing (rasins almond etc.) Don't put too much icing (if you use icing) it will be too sweet.",

The roasted oil is dark brown in color. The other is a clear cooking oil used widely in South Asia because it doesn't have as distinct a flavor as mustard oil coconut oil and isn't as unhealthy or expensive as ghee.",
