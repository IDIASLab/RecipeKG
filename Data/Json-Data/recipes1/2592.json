I made these cookies and i was astonished! They are easy and fun to make and they taste unbelievable! The thing was i didnt put in the sour cream. I thought that was a very unnecessary item. They turned out better than i could have hoped. I have no trouble saying that they are the best cookies i have ever made. My family loves them! Im going to give them out as gifts to all my friends for the holidays! These are truly great cookies!",
