Experiment with the recipe. And make sure to place this one in your recipe box because people will be asking for the recipe.",

However there are a few pointers I'd like to share which may help other readers: 1) You may need to add more herbs they could've used a \"kick\" 2) I used my 6-muffin jumbo tin and it worked well;I would not have have enough batter for the 12-muffin tin unless I made these super small and if you do that what's the point? 3) Don't drop them by spoonfuls into the tins - wet your hand and grab blobfuls it's much easier! This recipe is a keeper and we enjoyed them last night with spaghetti & meatballs.",
