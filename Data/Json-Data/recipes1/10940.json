Your filling was good enhanced with grated Parmesan cheese in place of American garlic powder and pepperoni pieces. I have also made it with ground beef bacon and onion.The dough is wonderful for any kind of baked sandwich. Here's a yummy variation without cabbage and hamburger: spread the dough rounds with cream cheese then layer with cotto salami parmesan cheese ham or chicken slices onion slice tomato slice and green pepper slices. Mmmm Good!",

I did not add enough salt to the beef and cabbage mixture so we had to add salt while we ate it. These are perfect portions and easy to eat. I was pleasantly surprised at how professional these turned out with the beautiful golden top just the right crisp outside and perfectly tender bread inside. I froze the last 5 and put 5 leftovers in the fridge for lunch for two days. I actually used sharp Chedder cheese for half and Swiss cheese for the other half. The Swiss wasn't very strong so I would use a different one than that but these were such a treat. A great companion to these were the German Red Cabbage and the German Potato Pancakes. I served these three together tonight and I couldn't get enough! Thanks for the recipe!",
