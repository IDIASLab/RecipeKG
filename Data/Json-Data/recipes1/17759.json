Went completely off the grid when it came to cooking the pork.   Used a Terra Cotta \"roaster\" normally used for Whole Chicken (It is soaked in water for at least an hour so the food will not dry out when in the oven).  Covered the entire bottom of the roaster in pearl onions, added some maple syrup, quite a bit of maldava coconut sugar (does not taste like coconut), the mustard, salt, dried ginger, fresh rosemary and chopped garlic.  Seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, and maple syrup.  Placed the pork on top of the onions, packed the coconut sugar on the top of the pork to form a crust.  Cooked in the Terra Cotta Chicken Roaster (which is a covered roaster).  Once cooked to temperature (always check with a thermometer!), switched the over to broil, took the top off the roaster and put the roast back into the oven so the sugar crust would actually become a crust and caramelize.  Let the roast rest uncovered -- did not tent with foil for fear the coconut sugar crust would become soggy.  This was fantastic!! This was the most flavorful pork I have ever made -- and am quite certain it was because of the fantastic brine from Chef John -- the combination of flavors was delicious.  Thanks, Chef John!  I would have never gotten so creative in the kitchen without this recipe! Am making your beef goulash tonight!",

I used the stoneware insert from my crockpot to brine the roast and that worked well.  Couldn't think of anything else that was deep enough to completely submerge the roast; my roast was three pounds so slightly larger.  I used my (new) cast-iron Dutch oven for roasting.  I don't have a meat thermometer so I probably ended up leaving the roast in the oven a bit too long, although it was still moist and tender.  (I did cover during the last third or so of the roasting time.)  I also didn't use the glaze as I wanted a meal-in-one and didn't think the flavors would go all that well with potatoes, carrots, and onions.  I will most definitely use this method whenever I cook a pork roast but tweak the seasoning to go with whatever else we're having.  The seasoning in this recipe is very good but would have been better had I selected different sides.",
