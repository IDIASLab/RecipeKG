I used sweet potatoes in place of pumpkin (baked and mashed) and added a tsp of vanilla. The dough is very soft but easy to work with. I used the heavy-duty stand mixer and dough hook to knead and it worked perfectly. I think I would prefer a bit more yeast and will probably use the dry next time as I would like them to be a little fluffier and dry seems to me to make lighter bread. But they were delicious and easy and my family loved them. It's a keeper recipe. Thanks for the post.",
