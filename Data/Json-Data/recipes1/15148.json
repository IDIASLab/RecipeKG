                "reviewBody": "I thought these were pretty good cookies, but not very chewy or pumpkin-y. The end result was a cakey cookie with not enough pumpkin or spice flavor for my liking (the predominate flavor was just of the chocolate chips). I also had a problem with the cooking time. I only made my cookies into 1.5 tbsp sized balls (instead of the 2 tbsp sized called for), and flattened them slightly; and they were baked in 12 minutes, not 20. I  don't think the extra .5 tbsp of dough would warrant an extra 8 or so minutes cook time. And there's no way I would bake these for 20 minutes; they would've dried out and maybe started to burn. So I recommend to start checking them after 10 minutes. The cookies also don't keep very well and start to get a bit soggy the next day. I won't say they were bad cookies by any means, just not a favorite of mine. Thank you for the recipe.",
