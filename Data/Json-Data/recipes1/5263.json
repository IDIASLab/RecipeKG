I used more hot sauce than called for and added some cayenne pepper and garlic. I took the sausage out of the casing and cooked it up with some red pepper and added it for the last 30 minutes or so (after shredding the chicken). I tried adding the rice into the creole mixture but both my husband and I agree we should have kept the rice separate. I think it soaks up too much of the sauce. It seems a bit too dry when you reheat. It would be better if kept separate until put on your plate to eat. Good base recipe and pretty easy.",

I seasoned the chicken with cajun seasoning and added chopped jalepeno's (the kind in a jar), omitted the ham and took about a half of a pound of spicy italian sausage out of its casing and put it in with the chicken at the start.  It was super HOT and flavorful!  The dish holds well on low for a long time - the second time I made it it was in the crock for 10 hours before we ate and I couldn't tell the difference.  I do take the skin off of the thighs before cooking, and the meat is so tender it just falls off the bone.  Delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe, Nancy!!!",

Next time I may add some okra or celery and more hot sauce too. I also followed the advice of serving it over rice rather than combining it in the crockpot.",

I used chix breasts instead of thighs and place them at the bottom of the crock pot and then lightly seasoned with creole seasoning. I then put the ham on top and in a bowl mixed the tomatoes/peppers/paste/onions/hot sauce and poured overall. Although I was expecting a bit more kick it didn't have any but my boyfriend prefers a more mild \"creole\" anyways. Everyone devored. Keeping this great recipe for busy days to come...since it's so simple - that gets a five star rating from me all by itself. Thanks Nancy!!!!",
