The changes I made were: I pre-baked the crust for 8 minutes, I cooked the filling on the stove top and added 1 tsp. almond extract, 2 TBS water and 2 TBS flour to thicken. 2 cups of filling was clearly not going to be enough, so I tossed in 1 cup of blueberries just before pouring into the pie shell. I also made extra crust and crumbled it over top of the pie before baking for about 12 minutes. I would suggest greasing the pie plate or using cooking oil spray, as the pie was difficult to remove from the plate.",
