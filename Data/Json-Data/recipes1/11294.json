Don't press the cookies flat if you don't like thin & crispy cookies.  Leave them in little balls for thicker and more chewy cookies. Finally, I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts to the batter and then divided it into 3 bowls.  In one, I added 1/3 cup of raisins, in another, 1/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and in the last one, I added 1/4 cup of dried cranberries and 1/4 cup of shredded coconut.  They needed a full 10 minutes to bake and they were all DELICIOUS!!!",

I divided the dough and added raisins to one batch; chocolate chips to the second; and Craisins & white chocolate to the third, which were absolutely delicious! Of course, they were great without adding anything. I did reduce the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added 1/2 tsp ground cloves which gave them an even better taste. Also, I didn't grease the pan, chill the dough, or flatten w/fork and they turned out just fine. Try it for yourself!",

I didn't find it necessary to refrigerate the dough, and rolling it into balls was too time-consuming.  I just made your basic drop cookies using a spoon.  I also tried flattening some using a fork dipped in sugar, but it really didn't make a difference.  In my opinion, you can just skip that step.  I will definitely make these again!!",
