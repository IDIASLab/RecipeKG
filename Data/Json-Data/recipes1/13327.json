As soon as I cooked the rice I realized I was in trouble. I doubled the amount of soup the recipe called for. I wish I'd mixed in some milk to add moisture as the result was still somewhat dry. The resulting rice mixture completely filled a 2 1/2 quart baking dish. Seems to me that somehow the recipe is off a bit as I was only making half a recipe and the FULL recipe is supposed to fill a smaller dish. While this was a bit bland there is hope for this recipe. IF I make it again I will cook much less rice in chicken broth instead of water. I would also add some salt pepper and probably a little garlic.",

I followed the advice of the previous posters to reduce the amount of rice because it may come out too dry... I dont know. Mine came out excessively buttery.
