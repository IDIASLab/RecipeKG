The no sugar added apple concentrate had 28 grams of sugar!  I used granny smith apples, because they are less sweet.  I will keep looking for another recipe that has less sugar overall.  By mistake, I made the concentrate/cornstarch mixture first, before peeling the apples, and then afterwards it was goopy and did not mix well into the rest of the mixture, but had it been done right it would have made a really nice gooey pie.  Actually my dad just checked his blood sugar and it's really high!!!!  Stay away, diabetics!",

I made my own thin graham cracker crust omitted the top crust & topped the pie with chopped walnuts as one reviewer suggested. The pie didn't have any artificial sugar aftertaste as the sweetener is apple juice. I wasn't sure about adding 3 Tbsp of cornstarch as I'd seen recipes with less but the consistency was fine. I made this for Father's Day for my diabetic dad and everyone loved it. My sister pronounced it \"perfect\" & asked me for the recipe.",
