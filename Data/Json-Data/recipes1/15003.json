(I like my food with a little spice!)\nI put it in the oven at 375 and baked for only about 35 minutes, took it out and let it sit on the counter for another 10 minutes (covered still) and it was PERFECT! The rice was soft and the chicken was moist.\nSo if you want a flavorful dish... THIS IS IT!",

I decided to turn this into a rice pilaf to add some extra flavor and also sear the chicken breasts before hand in a pan.  Like most people, I used chicken broth instead of water.  I also diced up, 1 small onion, 1-2 stalks of celery, and a can of mushrooms and threw that into the mixture to add more flavor.  Everyone in my house is a rice lover so I ususally double the rice/soup/chicken broth and bake it in a 13x9 pan.  I also pan sear the chicken over high heat with lawrys poultry seasoning and paprika to give the chicken a little extra flavor.  This has become a weekly meal in the house, plenty of clean-up time while the dish is baking!",
