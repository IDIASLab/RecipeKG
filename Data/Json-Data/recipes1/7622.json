I served it as an appetizer with a crusty italian bread cut in about 3/4 inch slices.  I doubled the recipe and we ate the whole thing it is that good.  My guests were stunned and are still talking about what a \"great cook I am\".  The reaction was outstanding and the dip is perfect.  I just added diced roma tomatoes and fresh chopped basil to the top just before serving.  Be sure to let the top get nice and brown.  If not it won't be hot all the way through.  We make this dish all the time now.  It reheats great. Nice presentation and excellent texture.  I would serve this to anybody at any occasion.  Thank you for the great recipe.",

I will admit, I bartend for a restaurant whos spin dip is really creamy, and this recipe was really nothing like it. This dip was perfect with the garlic parmesan breadsticks I made from this site.  In case you are in search of a creamier dip, my restaurant uses chicken stock to make the dip thinner. Just a suggestion.",

It also gave everyone a \"taste\" for artichokes which was something we did not have prior to this! Some changes - I did not layer anything - mixed it all together and popped it in the oven. I did not use the heavy cream and instead added two 8oz bricks of softened cream cheese. I used a combo Romano/Parmesan already grated cheese. I used the jarred minced garlic in olive oil (and I doubled it for our family). It gets just a little crusty on the edges but everyone inhaled those too. It is even better the next day (so it is safe to make a day ahead if you can stand the yummy aroma!) and can be popped right back in the oven without losing anything. This is a total keeper at our house - many thanks for sharing! Wish I had some right now...",
