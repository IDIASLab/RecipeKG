                "reviewBody": "these couldn't be any easier to make with very little utensils and dishes to do after! Great for a last minute treat for parties or holiday trays. I made one batch as written. They are very good only take a few minutes in the refrigerator to harden up and slide right off the silpat-lined cookie sheet. They have a subtle peanut butter flavor. I made a second batch using milk chocolate chips and added some coursely chopped butter pretzels to the mix with the other ingredients. These were also great! This is a very versatile recipe with endless combinations of chips or add-ons. I would suggest if you want a more peanut buttery flavor to the recipe as written I'd use one cup white chocolate and 1 cup pb butter chips. Thanks for this great recipe. They look really festive with the little jimmies and holiday sprinkles on top.",
