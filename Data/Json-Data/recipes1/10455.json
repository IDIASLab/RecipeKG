The thin chocolate layer on bottom was thick and rich and the rum custard on top was light and soft with a very delicate rum flavor. We always had ours on regular pie crust not graham cracker crust so that's what I made. We also never used whipped cream just a few semi-sweet chocolate shavings on top of the rum layer. This pie is plenty decadent without cream or graham cracker crust. My favorite pie - Perfect! I am new to this site but will try to upload two pictures of the pie as I made it.",
