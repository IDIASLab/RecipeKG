Changes I made were: 1/2 cup sugar instead of a whole cup. Instead of adding water, I used the pineapple undrained. Seems to me it will give more flavor than draining and adding plain water. Also, I beat the eggs with a fork before I mixed in anything else. I used 1 tsp. of vanilla instead of 1 TBSP, it sounds like way too much for such a small recipe. My changes worked great. This is a delicious accompaniment to baked ham!! Thanks, Lisa!",

This came out very similar to the one I lost. I know my original one didn\u2019t have vanilla in it, but I really liked that as an addition, so I\u2019m planning on keeping it. I also used the pineapple juice instead of the water since I don\u2019t see the point of draining it and tossing it and then adding water. I actually only used \u00bc c. of sugar because I wanted it as a side dish and not too sweet. I think it still turned out very good and fairly sweet, so depending on what I\u2019m making it for will probably use either \u00bc c. or \u00bd c. of sugar in the future. I think with a whole cup of sugar it would have to be a relish/topping or dessert type thing (I like the ice cream idea one of the other reviewers mentioned) and not really a side, it would be very sweet. I took it to a holiday potluck and it was served more or less room temp, by the time people ate it, but everyone liked it.",
