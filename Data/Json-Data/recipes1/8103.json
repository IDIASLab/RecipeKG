Made chicken tenderloins on the George Forman then cooked in skillet with teriyaki sauce to heat. After chicken was done...heated salsa in micro for 1 minute poured over chicken. Served with teriyaki rice and green beans...WAS AWESOME!!!!!",

Fresh produce is mandatory. The spiciness is pepper dependent just like garlic varieties -- so sample to know your ingredients.
