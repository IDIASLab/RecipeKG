I used the last part of a bag of Cape Cod Sea Salt and Cracked Black Pepper flavored chips.  It was awesome!  My DH (lover of all things meatloaf) proclaimed this \"the best meatloaf I have ever had!\"  I swear there was a tear in his eye!  All evening after dinner he would sniff the air (it did smell wonderful) and say \"boy that meatloaf was good!\"  I suspect that at lunch time DH and my mom will be trying to outwit each other to make a sandwich out of the last piece.  I only hope that before they hurt each other they realize that I snuck it out in my lunch bag when I left for  work this morning. (insert diabolical laugh here)",

I followed the advice of some of the other recommendations and slathered on a bunch of extra BBQ sauce under the bacon (heaven) used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of crushed crackers (fabulous) upped the spices as I do with everything and only cooked it for about an hour. It was perfectly done and everyone who ate it was obsessed about getting the recipe from me. Also for a novice/fearful chef like me it was super-easy to make and hard to screw up which is always a plus.",

No onion crackers or potato chips. Used 1 cup plain bread crumbs. Increase to 1.5 tsp liquid smoke flavoring. Increase to 1 tsp ground black pepper. Decrease to 1/4 tsp salt. FYI for the beef lovers in your family: Bison tastes like beef only much more flavor more intense. Bison are healthier b/c they can't live contained. They must eat on the free range. Bison are leaner too. The first two times I made this recipe I used beef. The meatloaf was great but... then I did the same recipe with Bison and the meat loaf was AMAZINGly tender lean tasty! It was super great! I bought my ground bison at the Whole Foods Market an organic grocery chain store.",

I made as is except I made/cooked in a muffin tin rather than in a loaf (cut bake time in half-about 35 min til they read 160 on a meat thermometer). The meat mixture was a little wet/sloppy and I was concerned when forming the muffins but they turned out perfectly. If you enjoy BBQish tasting things try this for sure!
