This is definitely not your average \"run of the mill\" burger, but something more along the lines of the \"gourmet\". Be sure to marinate your tomatoes at room temperature. I added some chopped basil to the mix along with a bit of minced garlic. For the meat mixture, I cut back just a bit on the Parmesan cheese and basil and added a bit more tomato paste. If you don't want to add the tomato paste, you could easily sub in some chopped sun-dried tomatoes. Next time, I might add those in anyway because I love 'em! These smelled wonderful on the grill and tasted even better. We served them with a mix of melted mozzarella and provolone along with the tomatoes on toasted crusty Italian rolls - YUM!",

The only change I made was adding salt and using 1/4 tsp. of dried basil to fresh per another similar recipe. I broiled them on the middle of the rack and nearly caught the oven on fire. So be careful if cooking them that way instead of grilling. I was not sure why they were so greasy because I used 90 percent lean beef. I can only assume it was because of the parmesan cheese. The black pepper and basil taste was a little too strong for me too.",
