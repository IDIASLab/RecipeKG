I did however, read some of the comments on how bland it could be so I opted to sautee some diced onion (about 1/2 of a small one) and 2 cloves of garlic in olive oil before adding two boxes of vegetable broth and a chicken bouillion cube.  I brought this to a slow boil and added the Italian style diced tomatoes and a couple of pinches each of dried oregano, thyme, parsley and a little red pepper flake for some heat.  One this came back to a boil, I added about 6oz of fresh spinach to the broth (I didn't want to cook away the nutrients into water I'd be throwing out) and a few minutes later added some chicken and proscuitto tortellini.  Just a little kosher salt and some fresh ground pepper, simmered it for about 10 minutes and then served it up with parmesean cheese and some parmesean toast.  Absolutely wonderful!  Thank you!",

I started by heating a large oninon and fresh spinach in a bit of olive oil then added the garlic and sauted for 2 more minutes. I then added a can of crushed tomatos (my boyfriend also doesn't care for tomato chunks) and the vegetable broth as well as some dried basil freshly ground pepper and freshly grated parmesan. I used a half bag each of frozen meat and cheese tortellini but cooked them separately so I could get a better idea of how much pasta I wanted in the soup (I ended up using all of what I had cooked). Right before serving I grated additional parmesan into each bowl. Prepared this way the dish wasn't bland at all quick and easy to make and except for the spinach I had all ingredients already on hand. Will definitely make again.",

Also inexperienced cooks may find the recipe too vague -for example garlic is mentioned in the ingredients list but doesn't say what to do with it. I used homemade beef broth from meaty bones tomatoes I had put up from my garden and a good glug of red wine. I sauteed two chopped leeks and some minced garlic in olive oil until tender and added it to the soup along with some Tuscan seasoning. Hubs unfortunately does not like cheese tortellini so I used a frozen mini meat ravioli instead. I used far less spinach maybe 2 ozs. Finally to make the soup a little heartier I added a can of cannellini beans. Now we're talking! With a little embellishment this was a wonderful fulll-flavored soup.",
