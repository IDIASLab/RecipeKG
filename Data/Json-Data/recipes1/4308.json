                "reviewBody": "I have made this frosting several times, and it is very good. However, there is a secret to making this frosting creamy, light, and\n fluffy. I experimented, just a little bit and it came out PERFECT. First, set aside 2-3 tbs. heavy whipping cream for later. Next, make sure you let the mixture cool COMPLETELY (refrigerate as others suggested) DO NOT STIR. After about 1-1 1/2 hrs in the refrigerator the mixture should be ready. It will look like a thick, gooey, paste. Remove from fridge, and mix with mixer. Add the 2-3 tbs reserved heavy whipping cream alternately with powdered sugar until desired consistency. MMmmm GOOD!!! (as a suggestion if the frosting is to sweet for your taste try using a store brand POWDERED SUGAR, and cut down on the brown sugar; really cuts down on sweetness) ***UPDATE***  I recommend making this frosting before you make the cake. For maximum results, (for those struggling with this frosting) I suggest leaving in fridge for at least 4 hours. When you begin mixing frosting it is *VERY IMPORTANT* you add powdered sugar for a fluffy consistency. Without the powdered sugar your results will be a caramel glaze instead of a frosting. Hope this helps. Good Luck!",

If you don't you end up with a caramel glaze and not the creamy delicious frosting you should have.  If you have to, after its cooled on counter top put it in the fridge for approx 15mins or until you see it forming a very light skin on th top then start mixing.  10/10",

While making it I had some doubts about consistency and color but it turned out to be such a hit and everyone LOVED it and could not stop commenting. I used it on \"Apple Bundt Cake\". Some hints- do not overcook. Follow the 1 min timing exactly. Also beat after the entire bowl has cooled down it helps to put it in the fridge. Once it is completely cool and you start beating it the color will lighten up a lot and it will become fluffy and have frosting consistency so don't worry about it! The flavor is perfect this is definetly a keeper!",

The key to getting the right consistency is to let it sit for at least 1 1/2 in the refridgerator, without stirring, after you add the butter.  *UPDATE*- If you dont need the frosting right away, make it a night, put a lid on the pot and let it sit over night.  When you get up in the morning, the frosting has the perfect consistency.  I use my hand held mixer to whip the frosting right up.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is magical.  I used store-brand brown sugar, whipping cream and butter.  I used 2 cups of firmly-packed brown sugar and followed the recipe instructions exactly.  I did let the caramel cool in the fridge for about 1 hour and then moved it to the freezer for about 30 minutes to speed up the cooling process.  It was completely chilled and cold, which must be the key to this recipe.  (Thanks previous reviewers!)  I followed the recipe and didn't stir the mixture after I put the butter in, and it left a film or \"skin\" of beautiful, buttery fat on top when I took it out of the freezer.  I scooped it out of my saucepan (it was a very thick \"paste\", but still fairly easy to get out of the pan) and put it into my Kitchenaid mixer.  The color began to lighten almost instantly upon beating with the paddle attachment.  I started the mixer on medium for about 1 minute to get it going and then beat for another 4-5 minutes (max) on high.  The consistency is silky smooth and the taste is REAL homemade caramel.  I piped it onto mini caramel apple cupcakes and it piped like a dream.  Thank you Carol for sharing this classic recipe!",

Note I also live at altitude (recent move - not a lot of experience in adjusting recipes yet). Well what I had after refrigerating the mixture for 2 hours was lovely caramel sauce for ice cream (after beating - unless I was supposed to be using an electric mixer to incorporate air?). So iwth guests coming in 90 minutes I had to punt. I added 4.5 cups of confectioners sugar (so for the regular recipe that would be 3 cups) a cup at a time beating constantly after each addition. THEN I had caramel frosting I could decorate a cake with. Everyone LOVED the frosting. I don't know if it was increasing the recipe altitude or what that caused my problems. I did boil it for 90 seconds instead of 60 each time BTW.",
