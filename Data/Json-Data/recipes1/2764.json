After I cooked the mix and poured it into the pie crust it barely covered the bottom of the crust. So I had to cook up some more quickly to add to the pie pan! Because of the spices it has a taste and texture similar to pumpkin pie. It was really good with some Cool Whip on top. It's made with ingredients I usually have on hand so I'm sure I'll make it again but I'll double the recipe from the start. Thanks!",
