I made this pie it is excellent if you reduce the sugar and use real butter instead of margarine and use lemon zest instead of the flavored drink powder. ( Whats REALLY in that stuff anyway?) I made 11 of these for my cafe and found I liked it without a crust better and it needed to be chilled thoroughly to cut right. ( Im using a pie slicer sprayed with a small amount of oil but I still think with a knife this pie needs to be almost freezing to cut well for presentation. A good recipe but needed a few changes.
