I would definitely make it again!",

I also changed 1/2 cup of flour to 1/2 cup of cocoa powder because I was looking for a chocolate recipe - I made these into 16 cupcakes. I didn't have butter on hand which is mainly why I picked this recipe. The cupcakes only took 15 minutes to bake and I am at altitude (Calgary AB) but they were tasty and moist. I haven't iced them yet will be making them into some kind of halloween treat. Thanks for the recipe! Rating of 4 stars because I didn't make it as-written. The cupcakes were more dense than fluffy which is fine with me because I want to dress them up and I don't want them to be too fragile.",
