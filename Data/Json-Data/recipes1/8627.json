Instead of the hot water, use very hot HALF & HALF with 2 teaspoons vanilla. This gives a MUCH creamier pudding and won't taste like a cake of flour and water, like some have said of this type of recipe. I've made it both ways and I can't believe how much better the recipe with half and half is!!! Why has no one published a recipe like this?!!! :-)",

I didn't have miniature milk chocolate chips so I used the regular size and that worked just fine. It is VERY rich and chocolaty and would be great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to help cut that a little bit. I did cook it for longer than the time specified probably an extra 10 minutes. I kept an eye on it until it looked fairly dry on top. I let it cool on a wire rack for about 10 minutes and then dug in! I will definitely be adding this to my recipe collection and thanks for an easy recipe using most things you already have on hand!",

I must admit I was a little skeptical of how this would turn out when I decided to give it a go. My skepticism was all for naught! This is a FABULOUS dessert! It's so easy and so good there is no reason not to make this every single day!!!;) Seriously though my husband was floored. He told me that mine was better than restaurant version! He was very happy! I made it for a recent get together and the hostess asked if I had gotten it at a local bakery that always has huge lines. She was shocked that this wonderful dessert came from my own kitchen! She said \"It seems like it would be SO complicated!\" Little does she know it's a SNAP!! Seriously folks if you want to please and delight the chocolate lovers in your life make them this chocolate pudding cake! They will thank you! As for the recipe I also did a 1/2 cup of white and brown sugar instead of the 2/3 cup. The cake was plenty sweet and very decadent. I baked it for 30 minutes and let it set for about 20 minutes more. It was warm and gooey and amazing! LOVE THIS!!",

Firstly I followed reviewers' advice and cut the white sugar by 1/2 a cup - no more is needed. Second although the texture is perfect the flavor is a bit bland. I think I'd add some maple mint or almond extract along with the vanilla next time. Thanks for a winner!",
