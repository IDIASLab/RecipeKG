Tonight I needed inspiration for dinner ... and no thawed pork ... so I made this with chicken.  Again, huge hit.  REALLY huge.  Will become a staple.  And yes, I use vermouth.

I also used garlic with the butter when browning the pork and subsituted red wine for vermouth as the earlier suggested but I did not add any onions or tomatoes.

I just made my own honey mustard with about 1 tsp of mustard and 1 T honey. Served over egg noodles. I think it would also be good to brown the entire tenderloin in a pan bake it in the oven slice it and serve the sauce oven. It was a lot of work dredging in flour and pan frying 2 batches.",
