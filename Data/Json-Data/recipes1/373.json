The dough then needs to be refridgerated so it is firm enought to roll out. It is a soft dough, so I rolled it out on parchment so it would not stick to the counter when I rolled it up. It worked great. I rolled the dough into two 12x12 inch squares before spreading on filling and rolling. I found that the roll actually needed to be put in the freezer for several hours before it was hard enough to cut into nice cookies. I cut then 1/4 inch thick and baked at 350 for 8-9 minutes. They are soft, chewy and wonderful!",
