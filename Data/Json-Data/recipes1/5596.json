A macrobrew (Miller Bud etc) isn't the best choice for well much of anything.:) I also skipped the broiling of the chicken. I added some pearl onions and a can of Italian style stewed tomatoes. Some carrots or potatoes may have been a good idea too. I cooked a pair of frozen boneless chicken breasts and a pair of frozen bone-in thighs for about 6 hours on low. We added some corn starch to thicken it up and served it over mashed potatoes. After this slow cook the breasts and thighs fell apart nicely. It was very tender. When I do a dish like this again I will probably just use chicken broth as a base and perhaps add a little white wine. I will add some noodles and turn it into a stew.",

I used 4 frozen (I didn't thaw either) chicken breasts on the bone with skin and I didn't broil them - although next time I will use garlic salt pepper and flour and brown them in a pan. As always I added chicken broth (1/2 can this time) to cover the meat so it wouldn't dry up. I used about 10 cloves of garlic crushed and chopped. I also sliced an onion and threw that on top of the chicken. Also I used 1 bottle of Pyramid Hefeweizen. Next time I will squeeze a couple of oranges into the crock to enhance the flavor. Cooked on LOW for 10 hours so the meat was a tad on the dry side. The soup/juice really helped though! Just pour it on! It definitely didn't have enough salt but the herbs made it really tasty! I served it with chicken and garlic rice-a-roni and sourdough bread. Next time I will have white rice and some veggies on the side. I will post an update after I've applied the modifications!",

I cooked mine on low for 6 hours. Perfectly moist. Add two bottles of beer and a can of chicken broth. I also added small creamer potatoes chopped up and onion. For seasonings I used one package of Good Seasons Italian plus the garlic it said. So the basic idea of this chicken is great so I guess you just add what you like!",

Added 2 T. minced dried onion 1 C. chicken broth and a second 12 oz. beer. I did not brown the chicken first. I let the chicken cook for 8 hours starting from frozen and I thnk I should have cut it back to 6. It was still a bit dry for my tastes. Adding the broth and second beer helped to keep it from drying out further. You definetely need to make sure the chicken is completely covered. As for the taste if you like a unique flavor try it. My daughter would not touch it after the first bite. You can definately taste the beer so if you don't like it stay away. Overall it was alright but I don't know how likely I will be to make it again.",
