You just want them a little crispy-not burnt. 2) Add 1 pkg of taco seasoning mix to the ground beef, once its cooked. 3) Top with Tex Mex Cheese, chopped tomatoes, green onions, (black olives, if you wish), and a dollop of sour cream. 4) Voila!! You've automatically added an extra star!  Enjoy!  I made these for \"Cinco De Mayo\".  They were a big hit: Even with my picky 4 year old niece!",

First off I cooked my ground beef just like I would do for tacos (that includes lots of seasonings and salsa). I did have to heat the tortillas for 8 minutes to get them just right. Instead of pizza sauce I combined a can of Hatch green chili enchilada sauce and Hatch Tex-Mex enchilada sauce and used that instead. I left off the tomatoes and cilantro. So I know what you're thinking--it was basically just a taco. I will disagree though. It is the baked flour tortillas that make this so good! Thanks for a great recipe!",
