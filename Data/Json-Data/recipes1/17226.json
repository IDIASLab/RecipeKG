And even if you didn't think so it doesn't matter because they're just that delicious no matter what you think they taste like. These were just too deliciously sweet and pretty to serve in mere shot glasses so I thought they deserved an elegant glass (especially for a fancy romantic dinner) and served them in crystal cordial glasses. Hmmmm maybe they should be called Chocolate Covered Cherry Cordials?",
