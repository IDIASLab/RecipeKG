I don't measure ingredients any longer and I vary them with what I have on hand. Plumped raisins and sunflower seeds make it extra good, but it's great without.It's a wonderful make-ahead dish and left-overs keep nicely. I always double the dressing using Splenda, red wine or cider vinegar, and light mayo.THE BEST! deserves 6 stars!",

Couple of suggestions especially with some of the negative comments from other reviews in mind. 1st, cook the broccoli, it not only tenderizes it, it changes the flavor\u2026I used steamed leftover broccoli and my wife and teen son loved it. You can choose the level of al dente to be satisfied with. Use the red onion but cook it just enough to knock down the \u201cbrightness\u201d of the onion flavor. Use a dry, non-stick pan, and just cook it enough to dry it out a bit\u2026don\u2019t cook so much you start to change the color, and let it keep most of it\u2019s crunchy texture. A word about the \u201cbitter\u201d flavor some reviewers ran into. There wasn\u2019t a hint of it in our dish. Is it possible that these folks were using pre-squeezed products? If so, have to recommend against it. Bitterness is most likely from seeds or from product that\u2019s turned in the fridge. But, really, just created the recipe as written\u2026including the sugar, and loved it. Good this next day, too.",
