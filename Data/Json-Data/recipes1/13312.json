                "reviewBody": "This is a great recipe for when entertaining guests at your house. I used it for a football party this weekend and they were a hit. I had to modify this recipe a bit because like one of the other reviewers said, the mixture made more mushrooms than what is in the recipe. \nThe recipe calls for 2 packages of cream cheese but I only used one package. \nI also used red port wine instead of regular red wine. In my opinion, port wine has a more flavorful taste that I think is better paired with mushrooms. Since there were alot more mushrooms then intended I ended up using 1 and 1/4 cups of the port wine because some of this is to pour overtop the mushrooms before you put them in the oven.\nThe recipe says it makes 18 mushrooms but I ended up making 45 mushrooms. They weren't small mushrooms either, medium to large sized mushrooms, and since I only used 1 pack of cream cheese I was surprised that the mixture still was too much. I could imagine how many more mushrooms I would have needed if I had followed the recipe and used 2 packs of cream cheese. \nPlus, although I ended up w/ 45 mushrooms in the end I only used the stems from the original 18 mushrooms for the stuffing mixture. \nNote when baking: When you place these mushrooms in your baking dish make sure you put them in there touching each other. If not then they may not stand up straight and roll over. It also helps some of the wine on the bottom of the pan to cook all the caps of the mushrooms evenly.",
