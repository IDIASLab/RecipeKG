Yes, it 'looks' like green onion but it's garlic. You can grow your own ~ I do. Easiest thing in the world. Buy a head of garlic at the store and peel the cloves then push cloves root side down into a pot of planting soil. Cram as many in as you can, they don't take up much room (leave an inch or so in-between cloves.  Water when needed and very soon you'll see the shoots come up.  Pull up shoot when about 1 foot tall and you'll have exactly what Chef John uses. Full sun is good for growing if you have a spot that gets it. If not, place the pot where it will get as much light or sun as possible (except in hot hot hot summer). Freezes well too in an airtight freezer bag.  Love the stuff!!  This soup is even more awesome when the green garlic is used. Do NOT substitute regular garlic...not the same at all......listen to his description of what Green Garlic tastes like. He's spot on.  You'll be glad you did it!!",

I used green onions and a 1/4 of leftover white onion diced.  I used 3 pieces of bacon chopped.  I only used 2 and a half potatoes, but they were really big.  I added roughly 2 teaspoons of cayenne because I like things spicy.    I used a little more than half a cup of cream because I love it.  I used lots of freshly ground black pepper and instead of chicken broth I just used salted and seasoned water.   I am glad I left out the extra potato!! this is plenty thick, creamy, and delicious.   Also, I only blended 3/4 of the chunks and used a masher on the others..  This is like heaven soup :)  I will definitely make this again!!!  it has so many possibilities!!  Thank you chef John!! your video for this recipe is very funnily narrated :)",

Anyway it's a truly warm and comfy soup the only thing I might do differently next time is take Chef John's recommendation and add mushrooms which sounds delicious and add some garlic too. Also I used bacon which added to the gloriousness of this soup. Kudos to Chef John! I've never made any of his recipes that I didn't like.",

Instead of prosciutto I used smoked sausage. The green garlic was replaced by garlic scapes which were in the freezer. Chicken stock was traded for stock that was saved from cooking pork ribs in the slow cooker. A few stray potatoes were rescued from the garden. I added one chopped onion and sauted it in oil with the smoked sausage. No need to add any spices since it was all in the broth and sausage. Then proceeded to follow the directions in the recipe replacing cream with evaporated milk for a lower fat content. The result: amazingly fabulous! Sounds like a new recipe! And costs pennies to make. Very filling too.",

Since my goal is to emphasis the subtle sweet flavor of green garlic I halve the cayenne. Follow the reviewer Aunt Tilly's suggestion and grow your own green garlic in a pot and you will come to see that mature garlic and green onions are not a substitute in this recipe. They are are whole different but good flavor than green garlic in this soup. Once again Chef John you are advancing American cuisine recipe by recipe from house to house. Thank you.",
