No applesauce, no reduction of oil for me-if you're gonna eat cake, eat cake! It isn't supposed to be healthy, just a nice treat! Neither did I add raisins or nuts, even though both would be good. Just wanted a pure and simple pumpkin cake. This one delights - tender, soft crumb, not too sweet, and a pleasant blend of spices, none of them overpowering. I baked them in mini pumpkin pans, then decorated them with tinted orange and green Butter Cream Frosting II from this site. The end result was autumn bliss-  smooth, silky little pumpkin cakes that are melt-in-your mouth good. Hubby and his staff gobbled up all 23! (out of 24... I had to taste-test one of them, right?)",

Oil does make the cake moist but butter gives much more depth of flavor. I baked the cake in a tube pan and frosted the top portion of the cake with an orange cream cheese frosting. The frosting: 6 oz. cream cheese 3 T butter 1 1/2 T freshly squeezed orange juice 1 T grated orange rind 1 t. vanilla extract and enough powdered sugar to make the desired frosting consistency (approx. 2 cups). The cake and the frosting make a great combination!",
