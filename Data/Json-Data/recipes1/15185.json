When stems are almost cooked, add the remaining oil and the leaves; cook and stir until leaves are wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer the bok choy to a serving dish.

                "reviewBody": "Very good flavor, although I'd cut down on the sugar a bit more!  I added several more cloves of garlic, so I'm not sure how the original would taste.  Along with the bok choy, I also added matchstick carrots and a few quartered button mushrooms, and I subbed palm sugar for the brown sugar, as I had it on hand.  Because of others' warnings that it made a lot of sauce, I added the entire dish to about 2 cups of cooked Japanese noodles (similar to angel hair pasta) at the end of cooking, and it turned out great.  I think the recipe would benefit from one or two thai/bird chilis instead of the pepper flakes, so I'm going to try that the next time I make it.\nWarning for those who are new to bok choy:  make sure you soak it well to assure all sand/dirt is gone.  I bought mine from the farmers market and had to change the soaking water 4x until the sand was gone!  It would have been awful if I'd have not realized that necessity ahead of time.  :)",

I am new to stir fry so I was leary of the oyster sauce (hate oysters so why would I want to flavor my food with it) but it turned out awesome.  The second time I made it I added a little corn starch to the liquid to thicken it a bit since the sauce is very thin.  I will definitely do that from now on.  Also, if you like the taste of fresh ginger, but don't feel like you use it often enough, buy a root and freeze it.  Whenever I have a recipe that calls for ginger, I pull out my frozen ginger root, shave off a few pieces with my knife and pop it back in the freezer until next time.",
