Don't saute the onions in butter as other reviewers suggest it will completely ruin the texture this dish is supposed to have and along with the cheese make it far too greasy. The onions are best boiled for a maximum of 3 minutes. I added a teaspoon of English mustard and omitted the salt - it isn't necessary with cheese and used fresh ground black pepper. I have often made cheese and onion pie. I have also made it without egg using one red and one yellow onion after boiling them for 2 minutes I drain and return them to the pan and stir in 1 tablespoon of flour and about 1/4 cup 18% cream over a low heat stirring until it slightly thickens then remove from heat and stir in the cheese (6 oz) and one pre-cooked diced medium potato along with the essential teaspoon of English Mustard.",
