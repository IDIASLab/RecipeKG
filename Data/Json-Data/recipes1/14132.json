I found the tiniest Yukon potatoes which were particularly attractive on the plate. The recipe is just perfect as is, although the next time I make these I might try a little more horseradish for just a bit more kick. For presentation and a bit of color I sprinkled some finely chopped parsley over the top, but fresh minced chives would be equally good. Just delicious!",
