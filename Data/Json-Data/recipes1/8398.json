DO NOT make the jello... you are only using the powder packet in this recipe. For anyone who is fond of nuts pecans or walnuts chopped coarsly is very good.

Just a personal preference of mine would be to whip the cottage cheese in a blender first just because I find the large curds a little disconcerting in a fruit salad. Also try not to make more than you can eat in a day or two because the juice from the fruits will make this fruit salad a runny mess by the end of day two. Went over very well with my guests when first served though. Thanks!",
