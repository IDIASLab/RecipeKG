These spring rolls possibly the first fried thing I've made by sticking them in a pot full of boiling oil turned out g-r-e-a-t! It might help that I love mango and so does my family but we all loved them. It was the overall favorite of that dinner (I think they liked the edamame dumplings better but I hated them so that makes them drop down in overall popularity:P). One thing I noticed is that they were hot and hot mango isn't the BEST thing ever. That's why I gave it 4 stars.. But dapan - this is a good recipe! I think it's the best possible way to serve mango... in a spring roll.:P",
