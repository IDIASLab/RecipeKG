I used almond slivers instead of grated almonds. Turned out quite yumm. Thanks for a delicious, perfectly textured, gorgeous cookie recipe! Full moon, new moon, any moon!  This would be DELICIOUS with pecans and pecan or vanilla extract instead of the almond flavor. Especially if you love Pecan Sandies!  I only refrigerated the dough for 15 minutes. The dough seems perfect for molding as soon as you finish blending ingredients. ",

Because of the shape she called these \"dog doo\" cookies and that's what they've been called in my home since then. I will make the crescent shape but I also make them round start with small balls of dough and then slightly flatten them with a fork. The powdered sugar has some deep ridges to stick to. Roll them in powdered sugar when they come out of the oven and then roll again if you want more sugar. I don't use almonds but use pecans instead. I don't grind them fine but I do \"chop\" them fine. You still get bits of pecan when you bite into the cookie. Overall a wonderful rich cookie that's excellent with coffee.",
