Broiling makes a difference - in the past I'd sauteed scampi on the stove too and this tasted more flavorful. I added about a tablespoon of lemon juice and served it over buttered angel hair pasta with some fresh parsley and freshly ground black pepper so the end result was everything tasting very buttery (next time I probably won't add butter to the pasta) still it was very good. Not only does it taste great it looks and smells great too! I will definitely make this again.",
