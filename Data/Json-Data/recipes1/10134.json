I did not have the dates so I shredded some carrots used 1/2 cup. To make a little more healthy I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 reg. flour. Also used 1 cup skim milk and 1/2 cup apllesauce instead of the melted butter. Added 1/4 cup pecans & 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon for extra flavor. The batter was a little thin so added an extra 1/3 cup oatmeal. it's not cold anymore so don't make oatmeal in the morning and this recipe is a good way to get oatmeal into your diet. This recipe turned out good and moist almost like a carrot cake muffin. Will try with dates next time.",
