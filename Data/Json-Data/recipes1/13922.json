It was still a little too sweet in my opinion but the oil was not an issue anymore. I hate to do this. I really hate to do this but this recipe was no good. I made as written and I am not understanding the reason for the addition of oil. It seemed to incorporate in the sauce but once poured into the serving dish the oil just sat on the top. This was extremely loose extremely oily and extremely (and I mean extremely) sweet. I saved it in my fridge in hopes that it will get better in time but for now all I can say is that I did not care for this at all. I'm sorry.",
