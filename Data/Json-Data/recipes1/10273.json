Any more than that and you'll surely overbake them. In my case I used the little 6-mold heart pan by Wilton. They're kind of shallow and this recipe scaled down to 5 servings gave me just the amount I wanted for me and Hubs - four good-sized brownies. For those of you who have this specialty cake pan I baked them at 350 degrees for about 21 minutes and let them cool about 10 minutes before I attempted to unmold them (and they were stubborn even tho' I sprayed the pan with a flour-based cooking spray). This recipe is all you'd want in a decadent chocolate brownie - rich and buttery fudgy and pleasantly sweet. The coffee liqueur taste is not obviously noticeable however I appreciated the way it livened up the flavor. They would have been just fine as is but because I wanted to dress them up a bit I made a glaze (just winged the amounts) of powdered sugar melted chocolate butter vanilla a dribble of corn syrup and Kahlua.",

These brownies are fudgey right out of the oven. After a few hours of cooling they take on a more cake-like texture. I couldn't really taste the coffee flavor. I think this would be easily solved by adding some powdered instant coffee. If someone could suggest a liqueur with a more assertive coffee flavor than Kahlua then I would be grateful. Thanks CAFN8ME for the great recipe!",

I put them in the fridge so they'd be more solid and easier to cut. --Disgusting as it sounds I probably ate three brownies around 8am this morning. I couldn't stop \"nibbling\" while I cut them! Brownies are my BIGGEST weakness and wow did these suckers win me over! I subbed cocoa powder and butter for the squares of chocolate (3T cocoa 1T butter for each ounce). I also omitted the nuts and chose to bake at 350 since that's where my oven was set. They baked in about 38 min. Sinfully rich and decadent. The lackluster top could've been prettied up with a very thin glaze but it didn't need it and it was easier to pack/ship them without it. Good thing I mailed 95% of these off or I'd be hitting them gym til they close tonight...:)",
