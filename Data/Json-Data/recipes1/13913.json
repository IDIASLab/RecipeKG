It was sooo delicious.  I only used about half a loaf of white bread.  I could not find a 16 oz cornbread mix.  I used one Jiffy 8.5 oz mix and one Shawnee Mills 5 oz mix, made them separately, and then crumbled them into the bowl.  Turned out great!  Thanks, Holly, for sharing this awesome dressing recipe!  It tastes as good as, if not better than, my mother-in-law's wonderful dressing!!  When I made this recipe again, I made it the day ahead and placed it, covered, in the refrigerator.  The next day, I baked it and it was wonderful!  Being able to make it the day before made my Thanksgiving Day a bit less stressful!!",

I am nearly 70 years old and have lived in the south all my life.  One of my southern grandmothers always used bread and cornbread mixed.  My other southern grandma did not.  One used boiled eggs, the other didn't boil hers.  To say southerners only cook things one way is to limit their versatility.  By the way,  both my grandmas made delicious dressing! Since they, too, lived in the south all their lives, I consider theirs authentic southern dressing.   I thought this recipe was very good, and a nice change from my personal recipe.  Good job, Holly.",
