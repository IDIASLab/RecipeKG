I also added a 16 oz can of cut-up tomatoes to the bottom of the baking pan and placed the stuffed peppers on top sprinkled the remaining cheese over all and sprinkled croutons over everything.

Instead of cutting the tops off the peppers like I normally do I sliced them in half lengthwise. Boiling the peppers isn't necessary so I skipped that part and just added some water to the bottom of the pan before it was ready to be baked. I used tomato sauce in lieu of the soup replaced the rice with couscous and then topped the peppers with shredded Pepper Jack cheese. The family really enjoyed the fact that the recipe called for sausage (although I used turkey sausage) instead of beef. Thanks Nancie!",

As others have said I would like to repeat emphatically: DON'T BOIL THE PEPPERS. 3 of 6 peppers cracked as I attempted to remove them from the pot to the baking pan despite being extremely careful. No wonder. They were so mushy and weak that it's amazing they all didn't split. I should have listened to cwillisf another reviewer. I did increase the ingredients by.5 to insure that I would have enough stuffing. It was nice to have the extra stuffing to spoon over the peppers especially since three of them capsized from being split. Because half of the peppers ended up flat this looked more like a casserole than traditional stuffed peppers. But on taste this is a good dish. I will try it again someday. And by the way since we aren't meshing a complex blend of spices the stuffing mixture does not need to cook for more than a few minutes--in my opinion--just enough for the cheese to melt properly.",
