I ruined two double batches with this high temperature",

She eventually modified her recipe from using shortening to using butter it made the pastry a little softer in the end. The VERY BEST canned filling I have found to use is 'Solo' brand. I can't find it in local stores so I order it on line. In a pinch tho I buy canned pie filling and add a little sugar and it works just as well. And the 425 temp does seem a little high I bake mine at 375 for 15-20 minutes then run a stick of butter around the edges when they come out of the oven. I add a crumble topping of butter and sugar on top.",
