This recipe by itself looked really bland so I added an extra can of Rotel a chopped up fresh jalape\u00f1o pepper and used Jimmy Dean hot sausage. The recipe does look unappetizing when being made BUT this was easily remedied. Just add some of that 5 year old turmeric you got in your spice cabinet (adds color but not much flavor since it is so old) and of course some shredded cheddar cheese to it. Voila nice orange cheese dip that doesn t use any of that fake cheese food product stuff! Never mind that pure cheese isn t really orange but it did make it look a lot more appetizing. After adding the extras this dip was great and everyone loved it. Because of the changes that needed to be made I rate it 4 stars instead of 5.",

So I fixed it...this is what I did: Added MORE green chiles/rotel and even jalapenos. I also added a few green onions some shredded mexican blend cheese and a wee bit of milk to thin it down. Hubby LOVED it. I think by the time I was finished \"messing\" with it I was tired of it and couldn't make a fair judgment on the taste of it LOL NEXT time I'll use HOT sausage and HOT Rotel. Will be making again (since hubby loved it)...I was looking for something a little different for football game and this did the trick:) Thank You!",
