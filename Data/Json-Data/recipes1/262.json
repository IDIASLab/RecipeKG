I also cooked these in my toaster oven so they didnt brown on the sides but I took them out at the time said in the recipe. This is THE BEST recipe I have tried on this site! These cookies are excellent!!! and since I see people added other things to the recipe like walnuts and raisins I guess that means I can add more carrots!!!! thank you so much for this recipe. it is SUPER DUPER DELICIOUS!!!! if i ever gave any other recipe 5 stars I take one back and give this one extras. yummy yummy yummy",

To make this recipe even more low-fat I used 1 cup I can't Believe It's Not Butter Light (which has the half the fat and calories than normal butter) and I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar because I didn't have Splenda on hand. I'm also a cookie dough fiend so out of curiosity I tried some of the dough before I added in the carrots. It was so yummy and it was nice to know I was only eating one raw egg:). Like some of the other revewiers said the cookies don't spread much when you bake them and the dough is a little bit sticky so before placing the balls on the cookie sheet I flattened them in my hands a bit. Also instead of greasing a cookie sheet or using wax paper I just stuck them on aluminum foil so when my first batch finished I simply took the foil (with the cookies still on it) out of the pan set it on the counter and let it cool while I grabbed a new sheet of foil and baked my second batch. i made this review before i baked the cookies and after they baked they were very bland. recipe needs sugar and tastes better as a dough",
