Left dough in frig overnight. Did not ice/decorate as everyone liked it as is. Baked only the minimum 8 mins. and they came out nice and soft. I only got 17-18 gingerbread men but might have made them alittle thicker. Longer bake time may make them crispier if you like that way. Family asked me to make more so started a new batch on this day after Thanksgiving. Will maybe freeze some for longer storage.\n2nd batch-rolled dough a bit thinner-1/4 inch or less. Got 26 cookies. Tried baking a few for 10 minutes and turned out too crisp after cooling. Recommend 8 minutes but may vary with ovens.",

Anyway now that I've made these cookies I can finally put in my two cents--having never made gingerbread before I really didn't know what to expect but this was quite a painless recipe! My dough was a little on the crumbly side but I suspect it was an error on my part. Additionally they taste more like molasses than ginger but maybe that's because I used Black Strap which has a very obvious flavour! Anyway I will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",

Also these are more of a soft cookie even when rolled out thinner and left in the oven a little longer. TRICKS to easy rolling. If you are in a rush put the dough in the freezer to harden. Then roll out right on the parchment paper. Cut out your shapes leaving space between each cookie so you can just lift off the excess around the cut outs and place directly in the oven. No \"bent / out of shape\" cookies. Cookies swell when cooking so if 2 are stuck together don't pull (you could pull and arm or a leg off!!! oh no!!) just use a sharp thin knife to push through the area and seperate gently. Voila! Great cookies.:)",
