BUT!  This recipe is great!  I tried it to use up my leftover Thanksgiving turkey and the soup is absolutely fabulous.  I will make one suggestion...traditional pozole is always served with shredded cabbage (or lettuce), diced fresh onion, fresh lime juice and a nice big bottle of hot sauce, so each individual can customize his bowl.  I put these items on the side and boy, did we enjoy our meal!",

Removed the bones and then followed the rest of the receipe. There were 5 fussy eaters at this meal and they all admitted that they were surprised and they all had 2nd's. We found this should absolutely be served with good cold micro beer. We will make this every year with the leftover turkey and will really look forward to it.",
