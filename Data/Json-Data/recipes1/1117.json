I took off one star because I thought the directions could use some more detail. \nWhen piping, twist the bag and move very slowly to get a slightly thicker donut. It also looks a little prettier. (You can do any shape you like. I made hearts for Valentine's Day last year.) Once they're on the wax paper, freeze them for about 20 minutes while you make the glaze. You will have to increase the cooking time by about one minute. \n\nAs far as the glaze, I melted the butter on the stove top and subbed regular sugar for half of the confectioner's sugar. It makes the glaze taste a little more like in the donut shops and easier to drizzle onto the crullers.",

Although I would recommend squeezing out thicker crullers for frying for what I think will be the real experience of every bite you take. The ones I made were a bit too thin (maybe the circumference of a quarter) lessening the punch of each bite. There's nothing to complain about this recipe. It was fantastic and you should try making them if you find these interesting. I also replaced the orange zest with cinnamon and nutmeg just like the other review said.",

This was too thick to fry to doneness without over frying. They only way to do this at this point of losing my mind over boiling oil is to put back into the press and squeeze it directly into hot oil similar to funnel cake.
