I didn't bother cutting into circles I just cut each biscuit into fourths (like you would for monkey bread) and fried them that way. They fried very quickly for me in one minute and I didn't have to turn them as my deep fryer wire basket had a lid to keep them immersed in the oil. It is important not to let them get too brown or you can taste it and they get hard. I even tried rolling the dough pieces into balls first and they do come out looking more like Timbits but they aren't as soft so I wouldn't bother trying that step (the wedges come out looking almost circular anyway). I thought I'd save time and shake the dough balls in a ziploc bag but that deposits way too much sugar better to roll them in sugar like the recipe says! I will definitely use this recipe again when I want to give my family a treat thanks for the recipe!",
