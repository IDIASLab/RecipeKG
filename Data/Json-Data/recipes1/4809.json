It's a flat bread and it's really not supposed to rise much which the recipe submitter pointed out. I did add a tad more yeast (used 1 1/2 tspns) doubled the herbs just because and then used 2 tspns salt instead of tablespoons but I make bread all the time and feel perfectly comfortable tweaking to our tastes. It actually did rise very quickly for a flat bread; the 20 minutes was spot on. I decided to brush on oil to help it brown then topped with Herbes de Provence for some prettiness before baking and it turned out beautifully. Very nice with butter or by itself. thanks for the recipe!",

Also instead of making loaves I made biscuits for easier serving and I baked them for about 15 minutes. Overall this recipe was pretty good with some tweaking though it is still lacking flavor.
