The flavor of the cookie was pretty plain so I added vanilla and almond extracts to the dough as well as to the frosting and it gave it a nicer flavor. It actually made exactly 60 cookies and I halved the icing and had the perfect amount to frost all 60 with none to spare. Not a half bad cookie if sugar cookies are your thing.",

The flavor was very good but they do need frosting to seem \"complete\"- I just used a can of frosting. These cookies are reminiscent of dense cupcakes. They're quite soft but not chewy like a chocolate chip cookie. Mine turned out very tall and rounded I may try to bake them without refrigerating the dough next time because my fiance thought they were too thick. I really like this recipe though and I can see myself making it many many times.",
