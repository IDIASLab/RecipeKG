I asked for the recipe and she said family secret but I also didn't want to buy a speciality pan either. But to my surprise the mother of this friend let me borrow her pan and I made this recipe.....I'm now going to invest in one. This recipe came very very close to the ones I tasted of hers. I have never tasted anything quite like this it's very delightful a cross between a stiff lightly sweet sponge cake. These little things are really really good. The only thing I did different to this recipe was sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the tops when they were still slightly warm on the cooling rack. And what a wonderful addition that really really made. And I served it with homemade whipped topping srinkled with more cinnamon sugar. Bravo Bravo!!!!! My kids ate them all before they finished cooling. I guess now I have to make another batch.:-)",

The ratio of sugar to flour was surprising so I underused sugar (3/4) - trust the recipe it's all right. Can put more cinnamon though it probably depends on its freshness. Put a bit less butter (1/2) and self-raising flour and you'll get yummy cinnamon buns:)",

Part of the problem is that the recipe is vague. It does not specify how long to beat the sugar and eggs or what they should look like when beaten sufficiently. I beat them for several minutes on high until the mixture was thick and yellow as other madeleine recipes often recommend. After adding the remaining ingredients the batter was too thin to even consider spreading as advised against. After baking they would not release from even my generously sprayed non-stick pans... immediately after one minute after five minutes or when cooled. The flavor of the cooked batter is similar to snicker doodles which I love and explains why I tried this recipe 3 times before giving up. I would love it if someone who rated this 5 stars and achieved success would provide specific details of how they did it. I went on line and discovered that this exact recipe is common as written on other sites as well but there are no reviews with corrections. I finally found one site where someone who had tried it provided pictures of their disastrous results... the same as mine. For me the recipe made about 16 madeleines (all in pieces after prying out of the pan) and would have been all over the oven if I had filled them any fuller. The recipe claims 6 servings which I would think means 12 but that number seems impossible.",
