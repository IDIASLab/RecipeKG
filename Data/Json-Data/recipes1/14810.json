                "reviewBody": "The many reviews that added black beans sounded pretty good and I wanted it to be filling, because it was our dinner. Since my shrimp was raw and large, I cut it in more bite sized pieces, put the pineapple pieces in the cooking sauce first until they were tender, mixed in the drained black beans and then added in my shrimp until it was just starting to turn pink. I then drained the liquid off very well in a strainer, and spread that over the veggie mixture. A trick I've learned to keep your nachos from being soggy is to put most the shredded cheese on top of the chips, then top with the veggies since they need the heat to cook, and putting a thick layer of cheese on top of all your veggies traps the moisture and chips soak it up. Throw more cheese on the top the last minute or so of cooking until it all melts. Your chips stay crunchy. My son said this was the best nachos he's ever had, and he is 25 and eats out a lot with friends. Both my husband and I thought is was a fun summer meal, and it was very filling. All this covered a 15X10 pan, and half of a second pan...so it makes a lot.",
