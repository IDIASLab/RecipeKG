Instead of using 1/2 cup of melted butter I just thinly greased the pan with the edge of a stick of room temp unsalted butter. About 20grams in measurement. Also I used the same measurement for flour but used white whole wheat (look it up! Its whole wheat flour but has the texture and taste of white flour - you can find it at any health store). I only had frozen blueberries on hand so I used that. To get more flavor and less calories I stirred 1 tbs of brown sugar and 1 tsp of pure vanilla into the 4oz cream cheese then put it into a ziploc bag cut the bottom corner and squeezed it out in a swirl shape on top of the fruit and batter. The entire pan of cobbler is 33 points! So at 12 servings thats only 2 1/2 points each!!",

I wasn't sure the softer, spreadable cheese would work, but it did.  Great recipe!  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing!",
