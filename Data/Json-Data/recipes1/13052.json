I don't think you can go wrong playing with this recipe and adjusting it to your individual liking.Good stuff Natalia.",

You can taste all of the flavors but it isn't overpowering. My 6 year old practically ate a loaf of bread herself with this spread. All the adults and kids raved about it. This will definitely become a \"family favorite.\" Thanks for the great recipe. I served this on french bread along with \"Best Italian Sausage Soup submitted by Perri Pender.
