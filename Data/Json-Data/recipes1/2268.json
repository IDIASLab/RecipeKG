I used chocolate ice cream scooped rolled in the nut mix then put them back in the freezer till ready to serve. The little bit of that mix leftover got dumped on top. Drizzled with a bit of Hershey's Special Dark syrup because I wanted something chocolate with it but was too lazy to make the ganache I really wanted.",
