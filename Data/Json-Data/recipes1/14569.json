I think this made for a more jammie consistency (adding more rhubarb).Fresh orange juice and zest is the key. I zested my orange over the pot to get those essential oil in the pot as well. I also figured if I was going to take the time to make jam I might as well process it in jars as well. I did that by sterilizing the jars then filling the hot jars with the hot jam and topping the jar with the lid and ring and processing the jars in a boiling hot water bath for 15 minutes. This is an excellent recipe I will make this again.Thanks!:)  ",

I used the suggestion of orange juice concentrate as my oranges didn't yield that much juice.  I also cut back on the sugar, adding half  stirring and then adding more until I got it right sweet/tart flavor I like.  I perked up the color by adding some red food coloring too.  It took awhile to make, but all in all, this is a keeper in my new jam recipe box.",

I love the full rhubarb flavor not diluted by the orange that is in it or any other fruit that are in so many recipes. My husband wanted a sweet enough jam for his taste, so since I increased the sugar until he thought it was enough (4 cups...and I know, holy cow!) to suit his taste.  I also increased the rhubarb by 1/2 cup.  Since one orange did not yield enough zest, instead of cutting up another orange I added a small amount (maybe half a handful) of orange bits of pulp in place of the missing 1 teaspoon of zest only for the added orange taste and the pectin.  It worked perfectly.  I always cook my jam by doing the cold plate test, because after one minute on the cold plate from the freezer you know that is how thick or thin the finished product will be.  This way I always know if I should add more water to thin it or cook it longer to thicken it.  Great stuff, will make sure I always have this on hand, might be hard since I know my son will surely steal it all when he comes to visit!",
