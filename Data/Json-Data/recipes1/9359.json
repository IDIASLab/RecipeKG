I could see a little spaghetti sauce pizza sauce tomato sauce even salsa just something to give this a little moisture...it's already cooked but you still have to bake them. I used a pretty good shot of Sriracha but could even see adding some red pepper flakes if you want to kick it up even more!. I think you could substitute some other cheeses for the American cheese I ll try shredded cheddar next time. Also watch your time in the oven. Although the recipe says 15-20 minutes mine were overcooked and a bit dry at 8 minutes; next time I ll probably pull them out of the oven at 5 minutes. From an eye appeal perspective I thought they needed something so I added some chopped tomato which gave them a little pop of color but you can use your imagination of how to garnish maybe some shredded cheese or chopped jalape\u00f1o whatever...sky s the limit there.",
