I placed a local free-range chicken on a rack, and followed the instructions (only had half of a lemon on hand).  The chicken yielded very little drippings (good sign--the juice stayed in the bird). The drippings were mostly dried out and a very deep brown--the makings of a great gravy. I added some potato water (poured off from the red potatoes I boiled for mashing) to the roasting pan and scraped up every last bit of the browned bits, poured it into a saucepan and thickened it with cornstarch for the best gravy I've made (NO added broth or flavor enhancers). The chicken was juicy, tender and delicious. Thank you for sharing the recipe!",

For the stuffing I used some leftover artisan bread that had gotten hard a diced mushroom diced an eight of a large onion and some rosemary and garlic powder. For the outside of the chicken I didn't use kosher salt instead used rosemary and garlic salt from one of those season grinders (kinda like the sea salt grinders). Again it turned out fantastic! I'm boiling the leftover bones to make chicken and dumplings or chicken noodle soup.",
