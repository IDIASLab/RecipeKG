I'm not all that fond of honey either and I didn't even know what cardamom was - just a name to me. But put them all together like this and it was very tasty. It was even better after being in the fridge for a while when some juice collected at the bottom of the bowl. I should have tried it as suggested (\"on pancakes waffles or French toast\") but I just had it all by itself a bowl at a time for dessert. I'll recommend this dish to The Woman I Love.
