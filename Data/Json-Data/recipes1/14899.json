I use organic pine nuts, and rain forest honey... of course, you don't have to, but sometimes these little touches help, I think. Add the pine nuts however much or little you like 'em, about 2 ounces is good for me. I serve this in sundae glasses, to show off the fruit, with plain yogurt and a sprinkling of Demerara sugar.",

I was afraid that it didn't have enough liquid, so I added two cups of o.j. before simmering.  And since I didn't have pinenuts, I used cashews left from Christmas.   I would rename it \"Really, Truly Delicious Dried Fruit Salad as it isn't really that pretty!  Served it to a crowd of 20 this evening and they all seemed to love it.  Thanks, Pixiex3",

She served it hot in winter and fall and called it \"hot fruit compote\". We would  top our ice cream with it, and when cold we would top it on cottage cheese. and dip with plain or graham crackers. She did not add nuts or cranberries to it, I think that is a good idea Pixie!.- Thanks for reminding me of this recipe I haven't made it for years.",

The apricots give this salad color, so I might add just a few more next time. I did cut them up at the end to spread the color out. I didn't want to wait overnight, so I put them in the water and brought them to a boil. Then I covered the pot, removed them from the heat, and let them sit for an hour. After that I continued with the recipe and they turned out just fine. This is delicious and reminds me of warm fruit compotes I've had before. Definitely delicious for any occasion even if not really, truly gorgeous.",
