I proofed my yeast with the water and sugar before adding the other ingredients, mixing it by hand and not with a mixer, I also used half all-purpose flour and half bread flour. I only had active yeast, not the rapid rise, so I allowed an hour or so for the first rise, then gently formed a log and cut 12 pieces with my bench scraper and loosely placed them in the cake pan then let them rise another hour. Love the way they turned out, next time I will add a bit more salt, but other then that wonderful!",

First, instead of a muffing tin to cook them in I used a pie plate.  I weighed the separated dough on a kitchen scale to make sure they were all about the same, (a little over one ounce each) and spaced them out in the pie plate to rise.  Next, I brushed the tops with melted butter before putting them in the oven.  When they were done, they were golden, moist, and pulled apart (plus they looked like I bought them at the store).  My mixer makes the kneading so easy, and with the rising time being so quick, I will make these for dinner on a regular basis, and not just for special occasions!  Loved this recipe!!!",

I have never had a problem with rising before, even at altitude, but I usually mix the yeast in with liquid first before adding to mixture. Next time I would dissolve the yeast in with the warm milk mixture and then add that to dry ingredients. As is, these only came out like little balls about 1.5 inches in diameter, not enough for two people! These also are a little sweet but bland, I would reduce the sugar and maybe add a little more salt or some herbs. Won't use these again.",

I used my KitchenAid dough hook to knead them for 6 minutes. I brushed them with a little melted butter before baking and again when they came out of the oven. I baked them in a Pampered Chef stoneware deep-dish pie pan (buttered); the bottoms of the middle ones didn't brown, probably because of the pan, but they still tasted fantastic. I made them at lunch time - we were going to have them with dinner tonight, but we tore into them and ate every single one of them up right then & there! Good thing I still have plenty of time & ingredients to make another batch in time for dinner...",

Had to use quite a bit more flour - probably another 1/2 to 3/4 cup - as dough was incredibly sticky and virtually impossible to kneed for the alotted time. Next time will try and knead with KA as someone else mentioned. If you're like me and use a scale I ended up with exactly 1# of dough which evened out to a little over 1 1/4 oz per roll. I'd probably shoot for 10 next time at 1 1/2 oz instead of the 12 rolls.",
