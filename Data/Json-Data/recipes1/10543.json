Also I cut back on the green chile peppers (I use a little less than the whole can) so that our 5 year-old can enjoy them along with us. (Too spicy for him the first time I tried the recipe).

It was my own fault. I printed out the recipe and then didn't have it when I made these burgers. I left out the boullion and just salted and peppered the meat. Also I knew they were supposed to be grilled but I tried broiling them. With that said though I did think the flavor of the green chilies was interesting and I'll try making these again the right way. Even so they were nice and moist.
