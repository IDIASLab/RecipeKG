I must say that I have only 3 other dishes in my \"favorites\" folder, so it takes a lot to get there.  I'm glad to say I added my 4th after making this!\n\nI used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and added about 1/4 C of water.  I added 1 beef bouillon cube and plenty of bay leaf and thyme.  I used cooking sherry as my wine and also added 2 tbsp of brown sugar.  I browned the beef with the oil and garlic slightly before adding the other ingredients, set the temperature to medium, covered the skillet, and cooked for about 40 minutes.  The sauce cooked down and was thick and delicious.  I stirred in about 2 tbsp of butter after removing from heat. I served this over mashed potatoes.\n\nTHANK YOU for such a great recipe!",

I made a few slight modifications I increased the wine to one cup (I used cabernet) and eliminated the mushrooms completely as they aren't a favorite around here. Also I found the sauce to be incredibly runny so I added a small can of tomato paste to thicken it and it was perfect. I added a splash of olive oil and I used one cup of Ragu Seven Herb Tomato pasta sauce and I think the chunks of tomato really added to this recipe! It looked and tasted homemade and my husband thought I slaved for hours in the kitchen making it! I served it over buttered noodles as suggested and with some homemade bread and we drank the remaining cabernet. This was wonderful and we will definitely have this again!!",

                "reviewBody": "I wanted a nice dinner after cleaning my carpets all day so I put this together in my slow cooker. I used sirloin tips, and huge chunks of mushroom. (Love them).\nI also added chopped onions and very generous garlic. Two bay Leaf, and 1 T of brown sugar which was a great tip from previous reviews. I substituted  1/2C Brandy for the wine and used 3/4C beef broth with the tomato sauce, it was awesome. Whenever I cook stews or something similar to this in the slow cooker, too much liquid can be a problem. My secret is adding 1 good Tablespoon of Tapioca about an hour before it's done. Leave the cover off and let it thicken. It does not cloud the sauce and keeps it very smooth. It keeps it more of a sauce than a gravy.You can always put the lid back on to perfect the amount of thickening you want. I served it with Garden Harvest Rice pilaf and salad. Thanks so much for the recipe.",

I used a Papain based meat tenderizer on the steak (I only used 12 pound) before cutting it up.  I browned the steak pieces in Canola oil, then added the garlic plus (as some had suggested) finely chopped onions.\r\n\r\nBecause several reviewers had suggested that the sauce was too thin, I did make an oilflour roux, but turned out I did not need it.\r\n\r\nI used about 20 oz. canned diced tomatoes (again as a result of other reviewers' suggestions) and only about 12 cup wine.  I did use a small 6oz. can of tomato paste, but next time, I would only use half, as it had just a bit too strong a tomato flavour.\r\n\r\nI also added Italian Seasoning and Oregano.\r\n\r\nThe buttered egg noodles are a MUST!!!\r\n\r\nI served this dish with cooked fresh green beans. It was a great hit, and since I am cooking for only two people, half the dish was left over for another day.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I reheated it, added some water as it was a bit too thick and served it over Uncle Ben's Minute Rice:\r\n\r\nI cooked the rice according to microwave instructions, except I deleted the salt, and added finely chopped onion, chopped red and green pepper and frozen \"petite peas\".  I think that this was even better than the first day!",
