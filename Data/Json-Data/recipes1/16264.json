Substituted 1 1/2 cups of oat bran for the oats and mixed it with the applesauce to absorb some of the moisture. Added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 cup chopped walnuts and these came out wonderful and look great. Beets are one of the most healthful vegetables because of their high mineral content--even better than carrots. THANK YOU for this recipe!!",

Next time I will cut amount of honey to 1/2 cup because they were very sweet! I loved having beets in these muffins that is a fantastic idea!",

I kept thinking \"this seems too healthy to be good.\" I didn't have fresh blueberries so I used defrosted blueberries and saved the juice as part of the 1/2 c of water. I also used whole wheat pastry flour to make it a little lighter. These are so light fluffy have a gorgeous golden color and a slightly sweet taste. No one was able to tell that there were shredded raw beets in the batter. These are definitely a hit with the family including my 23-month old toddlers. Thank you for creating (and sharing) a healthy and delicious blueberry muffin recipe. UPDATE (9 months later): We love these so much that we make them at least once every other month. We ran out of whole wheat pastry flour we used whole wheat flour and it was still light and delicious. We just made these with vanilla Greek yogurt instead of oil still very moist. UPDATE December 11 2012- Almost a year later and still a favorite. We sometimes substitute two very ripe bananas for half the applesauce. We continue to use Vanilla Greek Yogurt instead of the oil.",

For texture I only put in 2 cups of whole wheat flour & substituted 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour. I actually used frozen blueberries and it turned out just fine. I also used canned beets & shredding was cumbersome. I just threw the canned beets into a quick chopper (it turned out as more of a chunky puree). This turned out just perfectly and gave the entire muffine a nice red coloring. Love this recipe!! Yum!",

There was a really earthly soil like flavor that came from these muffins that was just not appetizing. (This flavor was much more pronounced when they were warm.) Although they looked appetizing the texture was too spongy & the spices too mild. I will be tossing these in the trash.:-(",
