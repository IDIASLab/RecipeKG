This definitely is creamy cheesy with just the right amount of kick! What's great about this is it's relatively cheap to make and doesn't require a lot of ingredients or effort. I definitely recommend getting a block of good cheese and grating it yourself. I didn't have Velveeta on hand so I subbed 3 oz. of cream cheese and the rest extra sharp Cheddar. I cut back on the mayo only using enough to get it nice and creamy. I used green onion finely chopped and 1/4 tsp. of Worcestershire. I also left out the red chile pepper and pecans (personal preference as we were serving this to guests). This was great on an assortment of crackers and veggies. And I can definitely see this as a burger or hot dog topping - or as they do in the South...in a sandwich all by itself!",
