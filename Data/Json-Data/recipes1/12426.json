Since getting my ice cream maker last Christmas, I've discovered that we prefer ice cream made without eggs over the kind you make with eggs (more of a \"custard\").  The kind without eggs taste like Bryer's ice cream.  This is, actually, better than Bryer's!  I use chocolate covered almonds (like in Bryer's rocky road) in place of the pecans.  An excellent chocolate ice cream by itself (with out nuts and marshmallows) and can be used as the base of any chocolate based ice cream.  Try it, you'll love it!",

I replaced the heavy cream and light cream with fat free half and half, and the condensed milk with the fat free version.  This makes a great ice cream base.  I make mint chocolate chip (just the half and half, sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 tsp peppermint extract & shredded dark chocolate), chocolate peanut butter, chocolate chip cookie dough (using the cookie dough for ice cream (eggless) recipe from this site), and birthday cake flavor (by adding about 1c. white cake mix, dry, and gradually stirring in the hot condensed milk, then add in the half and half and vanilla).  This recipe has so many possibilities!  So easy to adapt to delightful guiltless fat free/ low fat ice cream.  Perfect egg free ice cream, THANK YOU!",

As this was churning, it just didn't want to set up as it should and I thought I might be making a trip to the grocery store for the dessert I needed for dinner guests I was having tonight. Even tho' it wasn't nearly as firm or frozen as it should have been, I went ahead and added the pecans and marshmallows anyway, crossed my fingers and hoped for the best. I have no idea why, but several hours in the freezer later, it turned out just fine -  smooth, rich and delicious with perfectly balanced chocolate flavor and level of sweetness. I served this in chocolate shells with a drizzle of chocolate syrup and an extra scatter of mini marshmallows and pecans.  It was beautiful. And my guests were pleased. (I'll bet one would even have licked her plate if no one was looking)",

I was a bit concerned with some of the reviews saying that this was not too chocolately but it turned out PERFECT.  This is a great recipe.  I adjusted the recipe to make 8 servings and used macadamia nuts instead of pecans because I didn't have any pecans or almonds in the house.  I was a bit worried about heating the condensed milk and cocoa powder because it wasn't doing much on low heat but it turned out great.  I added chocolate chips halfway through and the nuts and marshmallows closer to the end.  I think I will put all the \"bits\" at the very end next time because I like chewy marshmallows.",

I may try subsituting with evoporated milk in place of the heavy cream next time too.  But definitely a keeper and it made my first time enjoyable and I look forward to making it again.
