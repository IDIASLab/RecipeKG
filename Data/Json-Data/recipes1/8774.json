I had some hot dog buns that I needed to use up. I didn't have any raisins so I used dried cranberries. I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  The instructions said to melt the sugar into a syrup first and then add the water but when I did that it turn into a hardened mess. I mean it was a real stuck on mess.  Not sure if there is something missing here or I did something wrong.  I went back and tried it again but this time I put the water in first and then disolved the sugar into it. That worked out fine.",
