I am only rating it 2 stars, hoping to draw attention to my review, because at the risk of sounding presumptuous, I think it may help lessen some of the negative reviews, following this one, in the long run .  I have made this cake once and, somehow, despite several substitutions, it turned out beautifully.  It is a very good recipe.  HOWEVER, here is a BIG ISSUE:  Presumably, due to our current economic woes, manufacturers of cake mixes have begun cutting back on the amount of mix that was standard for most cake mixes, the 18.25 oz., such as this recipe and many other recipes call for.  And they have instead reduced the actual amount in their boxes to 15.25 ounces.  Word has it they are adding in just enough leavening ingredients to make the cakes manifest to the same size, but which produces a cake much different than the way it would have turned out, had consumers been aware of the changes.  And the boxes themselves aren't that much smaller, thus fooling the average consumer into thinking they are still getting the same amount of cake mix for the same price.  Since this recipe calls for an 18.25 oz. box of mix, double-check that the mix you get is the same amount.  Otherwise, recipes that would normally work, won't, unless adjusted.  Some premium brand mixes still make mixes in the 18.25 oz. size, as well as some generic brands, or so I've heard.  But just thought I'd interject this info, if it helps. Anyway, 5 stars!",

Extremely moist and tasted great.  I did make a few substitutions.  I made the cake batter from scratch (2 1/3 c. flour, 1 tbl. baking powder, 3/4 tsp. salt, 1 1/2 c. white sugar & 1/2 c. shortening.  Sift together dry ing. & add shortening until crumbly in nature.  Then follow the recipe as is).  Added 1 tsp of vanilla & 1/2 tsp of brandy extract to the batter.  Reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cups.  Halved the icing & added 1/4 tsp of brandy extract to that, as well.  I'm not big on glaze & only ended up using about 3/4 of what I made.  I served it warm & ended up eating seconds which I never do.  It was easy to make & I loved the taste.  This is the cake to make when you're craving something sweet & satisfying.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!",

I baked it in a 9x13 glass dish.  This cake would likely be much prettier in a bundt pan, so I will try that next time.  Its taste is to DIE for, even with the full cup of brown sugar.  Wow!  Serve it warm with ice cream and oh my, you have yourself an exquisite dessert.  Pretty, no, so probably not a cake you'd want to take to someone you were trying to really impress.
