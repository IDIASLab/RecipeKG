My grandma took metal loaf pans, and drilled a few wholes in the sides of them along the bottom of the pan.  When she cooks meatloaf, she puts the loaf pan inside a cake pan, and a lot of the grease drains out of the pan.  This keeps it from crumbling, and also makes it a lot healthier!  It still tastes just as good!",

Added the concentrated tomato soup until it looked about the right consistency (about half the tin). Cooked in about 45 minutes (I used a meat thermometer to tell if it was cooked). Result .... excellent, moist and sliceable (didn't slice it thinly though!). Served on a bed of couscous (with green pepper & celery) with the leftover tomato soup thinned down with a lttle water and heated up as a sauce accompanied by fresh brussel sprouts straight from the garden. This one is going in the recipe book.",
