I love, love, love these pancakes!  They are nice and fluffy and w/a great flavor and texture.  I subbed whole wheat flour and Splenda brown sugar blend for the AP flour and sugar (and I only had old fashioned oats) w/amazing results. I also am not a big fan of buttermilk, so I used 1% \"regular\" milk.   I am a home made pancake convert, and healthy ones, at that!  THANK YOU for an awesome recipe (DH concurs).  My only wish is that I'd had the ingredients to make home made butter & maple syrup to serve along with them.  ",

I doubled this recipe, blending the dry ingredients in the processor first, then the wet just to incorporate it. Next time I may add a touch less baking soda or add some brown sugar to hide the baking powder taste (there was a slight taste of it). \n*Update 1* I made these again with 1/2 tsp. baking soda and 2 Tbl brown sugar. They came out great! *Update 2* to this I've also added in 1/4 C. pecans, blended right in with everything else. Delish!",

I made some slight modifications: I used skim milk instead of buttermilk and substituted two egg whites for one whole egg. I also added banana slices to the batter, and topped my finished pancakes with whipped cream, additional banana slices, and a generous sprinkling of wheat bran. Delicious! Probably better than the pancakes I've had at Bob Evans. Thank you for this recipe! \nUPDATE:\nI made these again today. Same modifications: skim milk, egg white. This time I also substituted whole wheat flour for white and added more chopped banana than last time. They turned out wonderfully! I love them even more now. Can't wait to eat them in the morning! Next time I'll add some semi-sweet mini chocolate chips!",
