Instead of a double crust, I made a crumb topping out of cinnamon, brown sugar, flour and chopped pecans; I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup of white and about 2 or 3 tablespoons of brown, and I added half a jar of Smucker's ice cream topping caramel. The pie was perfect at 45 minutes in the oven, and it tasted SO GOOD. Half of it's gone already and it's still hot...will be a keeper.",

                "reviewBody": "I've been playing around with creating my own caramel apple pie recipe for a few years and this is the one I started with. Originally mine were also to runny inside. I used some tips from another website about pies and did the following: Subsitute the constarch for 2 Tbsp Tapioca (ground) - the tips said to use Tapioca flour or granulated tapioca but we live in a small town and can't find either so I bought the tapioca in a box and ground it to near flour in my food processor. The tip didn't say how much to add but the Tapioca box said to use 2Tbs for a fruit pie. Also I sprinkled the bottom crust with cinnamon sugar (this is supposed to make the bottom crust crispier) and also sprinkled the bottom crust with 2Tbs ground oats to help absorb any excess moisture. I used 5-6 granny smith apples with this method and it's not too runny at all. Very nice actually. Now my problem is that I tried using the individually wrapped caramels (to help eliminated having so much liquid in the pie). Do Not use individually wrapped caramels... the are way to chewing and don't spread out or melt like I had hoped they would. Also I used a crumb topping made from flour butter brown sugar and pecans which goes very good with this pie. On my next effort I'm going to try \"Grandma's Secret Pie Crust\" recipe from this site and either make homemade caramel or try to find a thicker version in the jar. Happy Baking!!",

I have made this pie 4 times now. After making the first two I modified the recipe slightly to help. I used 7 c. Honey Crisp apples and added an extra Tbsp of cornstarch (it was a little runny the first two times I made it). Make sure to brush on an egg wash on the top of the pie and it will get a wonderful maghogany color. I sprinkle with a large grain decorating sugar before baking too. Cover the tops with aluminum after about 15-20 minutes and then uncover for the last 15 minutes of baking. The last two were sold by the slice at a Craft Bazaar and people loved it and wanted the recipe. Thanks for such a great recipe!",

Instead of the sugar I just used an entire 16 oz jar of Smucker's Caramel topping and a 4 oz bag of chopped pecans instead of 1/4 cup. Instead of the 3 tablespoons of corn starch I used about 8. The pie was STILL runny when cut still warm however when it cooled to room temperature it was perfect. The family loved the pie. I didn't use really tart apples but the pie would have been too sweet if I had put ANY of the sugar and I like things really sweet Just in case you want your pie warm you can just dip a little of the sauce that runs out of the pie out and ladel it over the warm pie before adding a scoop of ice cream or whipped topping.",
