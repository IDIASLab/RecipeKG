Yummmm.    I made a few modifications based upon what was already in fridge. Used orange marmalade and spicy brown mustard :>. Also sprinkled just a bit of garlic on one slice of bread...what's a recipe without garlic.  Came out wonderful.  Now my husband gives this 4 star as he felt the orange marmalade was a bit too sweet.  But the recipe didn't call for orange marmalade!  I tried to find the mango chutney at a local grocery store to no avail.  I think next time I will just cut the amount of jam in half as it was really a nice complement to the brie.  We also needed to zap in microwave for 30 secs...didn't get hot enough.  This made perfect. Make sure your brie gets nice and hot and slightly runny.  Makes perfect.",

The Brie was a bit of a pain to work with but I did enjoy the experience of using olive oil to grill a sandwich instead of the usual butter. That worked out fine and although the sandwich was pretty good very filling and a nice change of pace from the usual I doubt I'll make this one again unless I can find some tips on how to work with Brie cheese that doesn't include getting it all over myself prior to getting it on a sandwich. If I do make this again I will try the Mango Chutney suggestion because that sounds very tasty. Great sandwich just a bit fussy to put together.",
