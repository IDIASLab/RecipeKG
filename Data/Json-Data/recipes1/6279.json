It has a lot of potential to be great, but it needs more spices and lots and lots of cheese.  Also, mine was very watery and I think the can of tomatoes has to be drained.  I added double the amount of parmesan she called for, but I felt that I needed more.  Whenever I got a little bite of that cheese, it was yummie.  Next time I will layer in the cheese to the whole mix.",

I made this as a side for my sis-in-laws \"moving down to N.C.\" dinner party. I took BHERNAN'S advice and cooked it on top of the stove only because I didn't have any more room in the oven. The only thing I did differently was adding (I know I'm boring) garlic and onion powders a bit of cayenne and cooked it al dente as opposed to a softer texture. Even the non vegie eaters went nuts over this. Thanks AnneBelle!",
