This version was very garlic and herb flavored, and maybe because of the strong flavor, we couldn't eat as much of it whereas we usually eat a whole bird each when it's cornish game hens. I love garlic though, so I didn't think it would be too much at all. This dish came out tender and moist, (used an oven) but missed something in flavor...it was almost so rich, yet still missing something flavorwise. I think we like the plain old salt and pepper version better after all that work and excitement of sticking herbs under the skin. Definitely has a distinct flavor to it and worth trying. Next time I'd be curious to stick other things under the skin...like maybe barbeque sauce or something more traditional like that!",

This is a definite keeper. It was much less time consuming than the usual turkey dinner. Thanks Richard for sharing your recipe!",
