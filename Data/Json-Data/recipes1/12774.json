I wanted to duplicate them but was worried if this recipe would be \"the one.\" These turned out great! They were hollow light and fluffy. I made some honey butter from this site melted a few TBLS of it and brushed it over the hot popovers. Yeah!! I am very pleased with the result and would make these again! Be sure to grease the muffin pans well! Thanks Christine!",
