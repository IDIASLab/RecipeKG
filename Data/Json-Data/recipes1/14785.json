Because of the salt content in both the tomatoes and the feta cheese, I opted not to add any additional salt. It was not missed, in fact, it was perfect.  For a double recipe I used 3 cans of the tomatoes and a pound and a half of the larger (21-25 count) shrimp. Will I make this again? , oh yeah.",

For those who can't find the fire roasted tomatoes, Safeway carries Hunt's brand, but I prefer Muir Glen Brand. They are organic, and have a wonderful roasted tomato flavor, deeper than the Hunt's brand. Also, they don't have that canned tomato taste as much as the Hunt's brand does. They can be found in your grocers organic foods section or at a health food stores. They are pricey, but well worth it. It's the only canned tomato I use.",

Then I add the fire roasted tomatoes, 1/2 c. white wine, fresh chopped oregano and some red pepper flakes. I simmer this together for 15 minutes or so. After the pasta is done, I add the shrimp to the sauce and cover the pot. When they have turned pink, I crumble in 4 oz. feta and stir well. Pour it over the pasta, garnish with fresh parsley and serve. Key is not to overcook the shrimp. Cheese does not need to melt, just be distributed well in sauce.",

I also used a lot more shrimp frozen raw. Unless you can find the really huge (and expensive) big prawns you really need to use a pound. I also used butter instead of olive oil to saute the garlic. I also used more like a cup of feta and put it in the pasta when it was really hot so when I mixed everything up it gave it more of a creamy texture but the flavor of the feta came through. Also used dried basil instead of fresh and that was fine too. My husband said \"this is like a restaurant meal\" and it took me 15 minutes!",
