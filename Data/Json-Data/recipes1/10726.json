He jokes that we have never had the same recipe twice!  He will have this one again! My modifications were: One can of soup, one can of broth (made a roux with some of the butter and couple tsp flour and the broth) and cooked the veggies in that.  I then added the chicken and cream of soup.  After pressing the biscuits down on the bottom layer, I baked those for about 10 min at 450 degrees (but could have used 5 more min) so they wouldn't be soggy.  Then the filling, then the rest of the biscuits.  I forgot the butter until it came out of the oven, but I brushed it on then and looked, smelled, and tasted wonderful (check out my picture of the pot pie).  Great, fast pot pie!",

Even though I used reduced fat soups and milk this still came out rich and creamy, but healthy!! Everyone in my family loved it, which is saying alot, they all have very diffent tastes. I will definitly be making this again. Here are the adjustments I made: I used 2 soft ready pie crusts instead of biscuits. I cooked the bottom crust in the heating oven while I prepared the filling. I used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and 98% fat free cream of celery. I also used 1% milk. I used three bnlss/sknlss chiken breast halves broiled for 5min per side (I just couldn't bring myself to use canned meat, it has no taste, and the texture leaves much to be desired). like I said this is still very fast, add maybe an extra 10 min to broil the chicken. Still very rich with the lowfat ingredients.",

After reading the previous reviews, I made the following tweaks: For the chicken, I used two chicken breasts boiled with salt, pepper, and garlic powder (brought to boil, then turned off heat and allowed to cool in pan before cubing). I used one can Healthy Request Cream of Chicken and one of Cream of Potato. I used half the biscuits to line the bottom of my casserole dish and baked for 15 minutes before adding the filling. As a personal preference, I added two diced hard-boiled eggs to the filling just before pouring into the casserole dish, which makes the sauce rich, creamy and flavorful. When done, this cheater recipe beat the pants off my neighbor's \"from scratch\" recipe!",

I also happened to have leftover chicken from a supermarket rotisserie chicken I had picked up two nights before. Well let me tell you - this hit the spot! Everyone LOVED it! I used 1 cream of chicken soup and 1 cream of celery. I also separated the biscuits (Grands)and made a layer on the bottom and a thin layer on the top. YUM! The only thing I would change next time (and thus the 4 stars only) would be to use low sodium soups. The flavor was fabulous but salty. Oh....and I also added savory marjoram and some onion powder for flavor. Also just lightly used butter-flavored PAM instead of melted butter to spray the pan and top of the biscuits. Definitely a welcome addition to my dinner menu!",
