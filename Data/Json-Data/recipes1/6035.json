It's got a little of everything - cranberries, grapes, nuts, and miniature marshmallows - all held together with whipped topping. This keeps several days.  In the beginning I was always told I HAD to use fresh whipped cream, but in later years my mother-in -law admitted to using nondairy whipped topping herself.  A memory of my beloved mother-in-law, and something that makes Christmas...CHRISTMAS!",
