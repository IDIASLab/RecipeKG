I eyeballed everything except the tomatoes (because I used cherry tomatoes and it was a little hard to tell how much I had). But seriously just dump it all in a bowl and add ingredients until it looks right. It will taste fabulous! A note for those interested in canning I think you might want something where you peel and boil the tomatoes as most canning recipes for salsa that I've come across use that method.",
