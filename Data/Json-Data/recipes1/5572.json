I also followed the suggestions of other readers and added 1.5 cups cream and 1.5 cups half and half. It was pretty thick after reducing it but then adding the veggies and meat made it even thicker and I didn't have to add any starch. I used 1.5 tablespoons of Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning and found it to be a bit too salty. Next time I will try just 1 tablespoon and or try another Cajun seasoning. Overall it was very good and also looked nice!",
