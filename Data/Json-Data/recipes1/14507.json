A Japanese roommate and I made it up in college on a dark winter night to avoid writing final papers out of the leftovers we dug up in the kitchen. The curry paste is easy to find in little cans at import stores, and you can add as little or as much spice as you want to the dish. It is both one pot and vegetarian. Serve over a big scoop of rice and garnish with peanuts, cilantro, and raisins.",
