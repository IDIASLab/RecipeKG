Neither of us cared for this even though I played it on the safe side and used far less than the 2-1/4 tsp. of zest directed for a half head of broccoli! Had to leave out the red pepper flakes in consideration of Hubs' sensitive innards but I'm not so sure I would have cared for it here anyway. I sprinkled the zest over the broccoli at the end along with the orange juice. It just wasn't a flavor combination that appealed to us.",
