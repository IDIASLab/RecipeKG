I did a layer where the nuts were supposed to be then a layer on top as directed -the confectioners sugar was all sold out (my bad for shopping on Christmas Eve!) so I used normal white sugar but threw it in the food processor to make more fine. Turned out good. -next time I will use a little less chocolate pudding and make more of the first layer (the cream cheese whip cream and sugar).",
