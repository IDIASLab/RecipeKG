And I also dusted the chicken with a little cayenne before cooking. Obviously we like things spicy! Try this one!!",

I added about 4 cloves chopped garlic to the oil when sauteing the chicken and seasoned the chunks with a little cajun seasoning and salt and pepper. When I saw there wasn't going to be much sauce for the pasta when the veggies were just about done I removed all and kept it warm added 1 can of chicken broth about 1/2 cup white wine with the lime juice and let that reduce a little. Put chicken and veggies back in and topped with cilantro. Oh-I also added a few pickeled jalapenos with the bell pepper as we like things very spicy. Very tasty!",

I make it in a flash by cutting up the boneless chicken with scissors over the hot oil then adding the veggies including a generous amount (about 1/3 cup) of jarred minced garlic. I used bottled lime juice and presliced mushrooms. I used some ideas from another recipe on this site Chicken Supreme II and added cream of chicken soup and a little white wine to the skillet when the chicken was cooked. You could also just use some chicken broth wine and a cornstarch slurry. Wow serving this over whole wheat penne pasta it's delicious and done in the time it takes to boil the pasta! Great stuff!",
