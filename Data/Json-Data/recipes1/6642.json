However these spread out on the sheet (an inch apart was way too close!) and they had a rough texture similar to a drop biscuit. They also did taste sort of like a biscuit but with some chocolate flavor. There was not a very strong chocolate flavor at all which disappointed me... especially after using expensive Ghirardelli 86% baking chocolate on these. I chose not to waste any more ingredients by frosting them. So the kids are eating them as is. I will not make them again though.",
