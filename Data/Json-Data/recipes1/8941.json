I was so looking forward to making it but unfortunately it was not that good. Does not taste much like almonds the crust was wayy to thick for one tray I had to divide it into an 8X8 pyrex pan and a pie plate. Did the same with the meringue filling because when it's too thick it stays creamy inside and often could taste very eggy. I made sure the meringue dried out in the oven to make sure no eggy taste is left in it. Anyway I am so sorry to say it was not a hit in my family. My dad and husband thought they tasted good but all other members of the family didn't care for it. I often make meringue cookies but this tastes nothing like them. Sorry:(",

I wasn't able to get almond extract so I used amaretto and cooked it in a pan for a minute or two to burn off some of the alcohol off except I think you really need to add more than 1/4 tsp to give it that almond flavor.",
