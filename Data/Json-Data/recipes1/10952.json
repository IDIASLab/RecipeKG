                "reviewBody": "These whoopie pies are great! If you like \"traditional\" whoopie pies this is the recipe for you. The filling is not a sweet buttercream or marshmallow but fluffy and just the right sweetness. A few tips based on others' reviews: I do not recommend refrigerating the batter before baking nor does it require time to sit. This makes the 'cookies' come out more dry. If your batter spreads thin while baking it is not due to the recipe. One element that is key is the cocoa powder. When measuring this make sure to pack it down (or at least sift it). This will ensure a very chocolatey flavor and keep your batter from coming out too thin. On a similar note the filling should not come out thin if prepared correctly. I made this on a very hot and humid day and the filling didn't come out runny. Be sure to beat using a mixer (I even used a hand mixer) for the full 20 minutes. Have faith the filling will come together! And do give this filling a shot. I'm generally opposed to using shortening but sometimes it's worth it. This filling was really great and worth a try. Finally these desserts taste great warm cool from the fridge and frozen. But be sure to note that the texture of the 'cookie' changes entirely when put in the fridge or freezer (drier and even drier respectively). Overall a great recipe for when you want something special that reminds you of your childhood. A",

The cookie part itself tasted of bitter chocolate and was a little salty. THe cookies also did not spread very much. The filling was very oily looking the ingredients did not combine well at all. If I was going to make this again I would use a chewy chocolate cookie recipe and a filling that calls for cornstarch and water as a thickening agent added to light cornsyrup powdered sugar and vanilla. I will not be making this recipe again. Even my 3 year old whohas never meet anything with sugar she did not like said mom what is this? No thank you I don't want it!",

Because we have a large group that comes over for Sunday dinner and we all love chocolate we doubled the cookie recipe and made a couple of changes: we replace the oil with butter-flavored shortening and added 2 squares of unsweetened chocolate (and one of bittersweet chocolate) melted. Because so many reviews said there wasn't enough filling we tripled the filling recipe and we used 2/3 butter and 1/3 butter-flavored shortening instead of all shortening. We don't usually use shortening at all but happened to have some on hand and were low on butter. In any case they turned out terrific- with not-too-sweet cookies and a fluffy just-sweet-enough filling. Thank you Byzmom!",

After reading through the reviews I planned on serving these right from the freezer so I actually mixed a little bit of cool whip into the filling (helps thicken it up a bit too). I also substituted just a little of butter for the shortening. The cookies were great I didn't think they were lacking in flavor at all.. but even if they were that filling wouldve made up for it it came out soo rich and creamy. I'll be making this again for sure. By the way I didnt want to make too many whoopie pies so I had some leftover cookie batter as well as the filling.. so I made mini cupcakes! they turned out great I baked them for about 10 minutes.",
