This is the second time I've made this and to make it more tasteful I used two boxes Marble cake mix and two chocolate ready made pudding containers. I also used a tub of Creamy Fudge frosting which I microwaved and mixed with the pudding.  This definitely moistened it and made it taste more like \"chocolate cake\" than dried cake with some pudding globs. I took the leftover frosting and drizzled on top of the cake before putting the cookie crumbs on it.  You could use any type of cake mix and frosting because it's basically hidden underneath the cookie crumbs anyway. ",

Then I used Oreo cookies instead of vanilla creams. I still used a few vanilla creams with the green food coloring mixed in. And lastly I sprinkled the whole thing with powdered sugar to mimic the baking soda that lots of folks put in their litter boxes.",

The cake tasted great and was perfect for the kids, but of course, the real knock-out was the way it looked.  It was truly disgusting and had the parents gagging and snickering.  I used Little Debbie brownies, rolled into poop-shapes, instead of tootsie rolls, which I thought would harden too easily.  They looked even more realistic than the tootsie rolls.  I also used an entire cup of cookie crumbs, dyed green, for the topping, and it looked really authentic.\nGreat recipe!",
