I used Betty Crocker's SuperMoist White Cake Mix Comstock Cherry Pie Filling Unsalted Butter and Pecans instead of Walnuts. I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN!!! Thank you dear lady for posting this recipe.",

I made this but in a unbaked 9\" pie crust and used half of the butter and cake mix (I skipped the pecans). I covered the crust with tinfoil and baked it about 10 min. longer than the original recipe called for. I saved the rest of the cake mix to top off a cherry pie I'm going to make like this.

I didn't have any blueberry pie filling so I used cherry. 1 can didn't seem like enough so I used 2. I had to use 1/2 a cup of whatever nuts I had lying around including sunflower peanut and pecan mix! Didn't quite have enough butter so I substituted a couple of Tbsp worth of butter-flavored shortening to make up the difference. I LOVE RECIPES THAT ARE FORGIVING! This still turned out great.",
