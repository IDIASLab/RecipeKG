It worked out wonderfully and I will be using this from now on.  I always make these at Halloween and Christmas, using the seasonal colored M&M's.  I cut the recipe in half, using a cup of choc. chips and a cup of M&M's. From experience, I have learned you CAN put too much chocolate in them.  They get too sweet and you can't enjoy all of the different flavors.  Let the cookies cool on the pan for about 10 minutes before you move them to a wire rack to finish cooling.",

My husband is in the AF and he took a batch of these in to his night shift guys during Christmastime I had to make a double batch days later as they had eaten them all and were demanding more. The oats filled them up and sustained them for their physical job. I made a few changes I didnt use peanuts or the M&Ms and chocolate chips. Instead I used mini chips and mini M&Ms I just prefer how they disperse through the cookie. Next time I make them I will try some coconut for extra chewy goodness. Thanks for the recipe!",
