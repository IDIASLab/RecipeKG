I used, 1/2 cup of bourbon, 2 cups of brown sugar, eyeballed about 3 tsp of brown sugar,  3 TBS OF GROUND CLOVES, and I added about 1/8 cup of honey.  I mixed the ingredients together, then poured the mixture between the layers of my ham, and marinated it over night.  Woke up and threw it in the oven on 300 for 2 hours, basting approximately every 30 minutes.   Talk about AMAZING!!!!!  This was my first time cooking for my in-laws, and they all loved it :-) will most definitely cook for you guys aagain for Christmas.",

I used a cooked/smoked ham shank that was on sale and wondered what to do different and found this recipe. I will be making this again that's for sure. I doubled the glaze recipe and heated in sauce pan to cook off alcohol then added to pan for last 10 minutes to thicken. Note: be careful to not let it all boil over and do not taste before hand or bourbon and pepper will knock you socks off. just let it cook down and you will end up with the most flavorful thick sauce you can imagine. Have photos to come as soon as I figure out how to do it. Thanks Amydanielle1 for the recipe. Awesome!",

I worried a bit as I mixed the whiskey and brown sugar together as the smell of the whiskey was VERY strong.  I prepared and baked as the instructions were written and the results were fantastic.   Of course, the pungent smell of the whiskey evaporated as the ham cooked.  By basting as the ham cooked it formed a nice crust on the outer edge of the ham.  I did let it rest for the 15 minutes be carving.  We served this on Hawaiian rolls and it was enjoyed by all.  I most definitely will be preparing a ham this way again, especially since I have a full bottle of whiskey! Thanks AMYDANIELLE1 for sharing your recipe. I'm happy to be the first to review and photograph your recipe.",

Cognac is a type of brandy, while bourbon is a type of whiskey--I would think you would end up with a fairly different flavor. Let me know if you try it. I will say those little bottles of liquor you can get near the checkout at most liquor stores are the perfect amount for the glaze--I always buy those because I don't have any other reason to buy bourbon and don't want the big bottle. (Is it arrogant to give your own recipe 5 stars? Writing a review is the only way I know to reply, and if I have to choose a number of stars... ;-) )",

I ended up taking the very concentrated dripping from the pan and added to some chicken broth and pouring over the ham after it was sliced. I will be making potato soup with the leftovers. I don' t think I will make this again.",
