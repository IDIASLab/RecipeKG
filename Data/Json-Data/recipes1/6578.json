Well, an unbeatable price forced me to give this recipe a try and all I can say is \"WOW\"!  I was short on cooking time, so mine only got to soak in marinade for about an hour and a half, and I broiled it in my oven about 10 minutes per side instead of grilling outdoors.  I did sprinkle the meat with some meat tenderizer before marinating, and let it stand about five minutes after cooking before I sliced it across the grain.  It was tender, juicy, delicious and received rave reviews from my dinner guests.  I'll never be intimidated by this cut of meat again, thank you so much Char!!!!  ",

I have actually made a whole cup of marinade ABSORB in to 2 lbs of meat in under 20 min!!!! TRY THAT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED!

That's definitely a thicker tougher cut of meat (it's not flank steak) and needs a longer marinating time about 48 hours. I used this marinade for 1 & 1/2 pounds of steak. I low sodium soy sauce olive oil vs. veg. chili sauce vs. ketchup and added a splash of white wine vinegar. I also cut the amount of pepper in half and added 1/4 tsp. of kosher salt. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go turning it every so often and rubbing the marinade into the meat. After grilling I cut it against the grain and it was not only tender and juicy but delicious!",
