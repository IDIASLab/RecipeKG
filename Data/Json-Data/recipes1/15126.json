I added fresh ground pepper, garlic powder and onion powder to the flour before sprinkling it over the roast. I also used beef broth instead of water. I didn't want to lose all that great flavor in the pan from searing the roast so I set the roast aside and sauteed the onion and some fresh minced garlic in the skillet with a little butter until the onions started to turn translucent. I then added the broth, let it come to a boil, and scraped all that good flavor from the pan. I poured the liquid into the bottom of the roasting pan, set the roast on top, then poured the wine over everything and added the spices.  This was one of the best roasts we've ever had. Out of that whole roast, there's just enough for leftovers for one person tomorrow. My boys inhaled dinner. NOTE: My roast was done in two hours and that's medium done. If you keep it covered the whole time it's cooking (just cover it with a lid or with foil), you won't have a dry roast.",

Second, Allrecipes made some changes to the recipe that I originally submitted. This recipe does not make 12 servings, it makes one serving per 1/2 pound of chuck roast. When I submitted it, I said it made 6 servings. I also said small onions, not pearl onions. I use small yellow onions when I make it. Also, if the carrots are large, I add them before the other vegetables and let them cook for 10 or 15 minutes before adding the rest. I also add whole fresh mushrooms if I have them, but I don't change the seasonings; my family likes them just like they are.",

I modified the recipe in several regards, elevating my rating from three to four stars.  I added salt and pepper to the flour, seared the (rump) roast in olive oil, used beef broth rather than water, and topped the roast with sprigs of fresh rosemary and thyme instead of the dried herbs.  I also made slits in several places on the roast and inserted slivers of fresh garlic.  I had other plans for vegetables (besides, I don\u2019t like cooked carrots or pearl onions) so I skipped the potatoes, carrots and onions and chose instead to toss in a handful of dried porcini mushrooms which added a great deal of flavor.  The biggest change \u2013 I wasn\u2019t sure when we\u2019d eat supper tonight so I used the slow cooker rather than the oven.  Very flavorful and tender.  Searing the roast first and adding red wine makes all the difference.",

It made it SOOOO tender and also cuts the cooking time down a bit. I used low-sodium beef stock in place of the water and ended up using 1 cup in all after adding an additional 1/2 cup when I added my vegies. I combined all my spices together first and added 1/2 to the flour before sprinkling on the roast. I also put the flour/spice mixture into a spice shaker to make applying to the roast easier and less messy. Worked out great and I only ended up using 1 tablespoon flour mixture in all - didn't need any more and the roast was well covered.  The liquid does cook down quite a bit, unless it was because of my cast iron pot, so I suggest keeping an eye on that, especially if you want to make  a gravy. You may want to add more if that is the case. I had just enough liquid to use as an au jus - no gravy needed. Delicious. Thanks for an awesome recipe! I will definitely be making this again!",
