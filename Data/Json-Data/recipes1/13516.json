My family adored it, and has since requested it several times. It has also made a great dish to take to any gathering with a lot of people, because the regular recipe makes a LOT of servings (like we measure the servings! Just plenty of dessert here!). I've not had anything but positive comments on it. One note - I made it once with a yellow butter cake mix - that made it so rich, it was almost too much. I'd stick with a regular yellow cake mix whenever possible. Easy, tasty and looks fantastic. Thank you so much for sharing this one - it is now a family favorite! (And I am making it again tomorrow for a birthday party! Most requested dessert I've ever had, besides my pecan pie!) Yummy just doesn't cut it for this one! You simply have to try it. If you like pumpkin pie at all in any way, you'll love this one. (And I didn't adjust the recipe at all - most need tweaking - this one is just wonderful as Patty P. wrote it up!) My family thanks you too!  :  )",

I had this recipe confused with another and had melted the butter for the topping.  Just drizzled over the dry topping ingredients and it turned out, also added pecans to please my family.

For a 29 oz can of pumpkin 1/2 cup of sugar was no way sweet enough for the filling..I had to add 1 cup of sugar and 13 cup of Stevia to get it sweet enough. There was also not enough evaporated milk for the ammt of pumpkin..I added the whole 12 oz can. I also had to add 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice to make the flavor better. The crust after taking out 1 cup for the topping had way too much butter in it. I would have used 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup and it would have been plenty. The topping was a nice addition to the recipe. I added coconut and almonds to it and it was really good. It turned out great with my tweeks..but the recipe as written wasn't good.",

I may add nuts to the crust too next time for added crunch. I also added some nutmeg and ginger to the filling. I used butter instead of margarine. I cut back on both sugars and it was still plenty sweet enough. We had it with vanilla ice cream...it took some of the sting out of losing to the Yankee's last night...",
