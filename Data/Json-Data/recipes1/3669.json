Truth be told I really only made it because I was over zealous during my last grocery shopping trip buying more than I ended up having a need for in a timely fashion. This included a boat load of mushrooms perfect for this recipe. I used a combination of shitakes and baby bellas which I think gave this soup a bolder mushroom flavor than the more common button mushrooms would have. I added the red wine to the pan before the broth and tomato paste preferring to let it cook off a bit and let its flavor mellow. I used no water as I didn t see any reason to dilute flavor. Rather I used a combination of beef and chicken broth. I thought this would be a weak wimpy flat tasting soup but I couldn t have been more wrong. The bold flavored mushrooms already gave it a deep rich flavor and the red wine and tomato paste gave it incredible complexity. I suppose one could add a lot of things to this if for some reason they felt compelled to like herbs rice pasta spinach or other vegetables meat etc. but this soup is perfect simple delicious and satisfying just as is. In fact I think it would be diminished if its simplicity was messed with. Humble served with a grilled cheese sandwich elegant as a first course for a more formal dinner I ll have to remember to buy a boat load of mushrooms more often.",

The only change I made was to add a couple squirts of Worcestershire sauce as I had no red wine opened (I don't drink wine so for me to waste a bottle but for a measly 1/4 cup would be silly). I did use 2 fresh roma tomatoes (deseeded) instead of the tomato paste. Add the tomatoes to the sauted onions garlic and mushrooms let the tomatoes cook down before you add the broth. I did not add any water as the soup would have been too thin. Use lots of fresh ground pepper and I added a teensy pinch of salt as without the canned tomato paste there really isn't any salt and it would be bland otherwise. Wonderful filling lunch (and relatively low-fat) and will be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!",
