Have a friend whose staple dessert is pecan pie -- and now I see why the basic filling is both easy and impressive. I used butter instead of margarine of course. Not sure butter was soft enough to fold into cake mix but it all turned out OK. I ended up adding about 8-10 minutes to the second round of baking to get a nice browning on the top. Only other change was that I used about 1.5 cups of pecans just because I had them and because it looked a little sparse with just a cup. Personal preference really. Would have probably had more of that pecan pie gelatinous feel if without the extra nuts. Advise waiting until these are really cool before cutting. I tried to cut them into bars when they were warm and they're just too sticky. They cut fine once they cooled though. Also advise cutting into SMALL pieces. These are very rich. My edges got kind of hard and chewy too -- not sure you can avoid that really -- but I like those pieces best. Will definitely make these again.",

Bake the bottom layer for only 15 min or until solid just don't overcook it. Oh and don't be afraid that it's so tough to spread over the bottom of the pan; it's meant to be that way and you haven't done anything wrong. IMPORTANT: These WILL come out gooey. I ALWAYS cook them a day ahead of time and leave them in the fridge overnight BEFORE cutting them up. You can also use just 1 cup of corn syrup without much difference to the recipe. This way you use exactly half of a bottle of Karo Dark Corn Syrup (8 oz = 1 cup). But still the full amount will give you the full experience of these bars:)",

Take the cake layer (in the middle) and move it to the bottom and mix the other two layers on top and you have an idea closer to what they really are. Also I agree with previous reviewers on this thread that this version may be a bit too gooey and will not stay together. However they were much better after they had refridgerated for 24 hours and re-thawed and I also may have accidentally added too much corn syrup. If this happens to you no problem-- I still had people compliment them even when I myself was severely disappointed! I'm making these again tomorrow. I will update then.",
