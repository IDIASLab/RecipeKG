Definately substitute the water with beef broth (I did two cans of vegetable broth and two beef) I added an additional cup of merlot 3 bay leaves and some thyme. Rather than simmer in the oven I transfered the meat to the crockpot after had browned it. Also I added some fresh minced garlic to the meat while is was browing and it was great. By cooking in the crockpot I found that by the time I added the potatoes and let them cook for a good hour or so the starch from them thickened up the stew just right. I added salt and pepper to taste and a little more garlic the last 30 minutes or so and it was really good. But this definately needed some doctoring up!",

I omitted the worchestire sauce because it just overpowers the other flavors and we really don't care for it. I used 1/2 water & 1/2 beef broth. I also seasoned the meat/flour with blk pepper seasoning salt garlic powder paprika and onion powder then saved the leftover flour to thicken the stew with. After browning the meat I added enough water and scraped up the bits on the bottom of the pan for added flavor then added all the broth & water onions and celery. For added flavor I added thyme rosemary extra bay leaf and extra seasonings. I suggest when you cut up the beef potatoes and carrots try to make them all the same sizes and not so big. At the last hr added the veggies corn & peas and last minute added the leftover seasoned flour (which was mixed w/h20 so it doesn't get lumpy when added to the hot stew). Served this with french bread and everyone loved it! This will now be our staple beef stew. Thanks",

I add cumin, garlic powder, fresh ground pepper, and paprika to the flour before dredging the beef.  Instead of shortening, I use butter and olive oil.  I also substitute 2 beef bouillion cubes for the salt and add 1/4 C ketchup, 1 tsp oregano, and an extra bay leaf.  This is a perfect fall or winter meal with homemade bread...definitely one of my favorite comfort foods!  This can easily be made in the crockpot so it can be ready when you come home from work.  Just brown the beef before adding to the crockpot, add all the rest of the ingredients, and cook on low for 6 hours. Before serving, add the 1/4 C flour paste and heat on high for 15 min to thicken.",

It is a great base for a stew but it definitely needs alot of flavor added to it. For added flavor and also for thickening purposes....try it this way and I am sure you will not be dissapointed. When the meet is browned and you have added all the basic things such as your water...onions..garlic etc....let it simmer for about 15 minutes and then try adding.....a few tablespoons each of ketchup...barbecue sauce...A-1 sauce...and chili sauce. Also add some extra worstershire sauce and a tablespoon or so of sugar. I know...it may sound a little strange but believe me...you will love the results! When all that is added...let simmer for about 45 minutes and then add your vegetables and simmer until tender. Do it just this way and I guarantee you that will continue to from now on. The flavors are amazing and it makes this a very satisfying meal.",

I added 4 cups of water but also added \"Better than Base\" which is basically a beef boullion. Everything else is pretty much the same with the exception of adding corn I substituted celery. It was great but next time I'm not adding worcestershire sauce and also watch how long you cook the meat I cooked it a little too long and it started to fall apart.",

Somehow it tasted better when you leave it over night. My suggestion is cook it the day before you want to eat it and store it in the fridge overnight. You will be pleasantly surprised!",

I add two cans of diced tomatoes and two cans of beef broth instead of the water skip the corn and paprika and double the worcestershire sauce. I also add 1 tsp of parsley and 1/8 tsp of red pepper for a little kick. Sometimes I add a can of garbanzo beans and a can of italian green beans too. Gives it lots of flavor and texture. Yum!
