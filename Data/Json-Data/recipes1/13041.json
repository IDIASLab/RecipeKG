Perhaps a can of creamed condensed soup (cream of broccoli maybe?) could be used to help thicken the white sauce. The next day though the leftovers were absolutely perfect - all the liquid had been soaked up by the noodles! I used fresh broccoli lightly steamed. This needed WAY more cooking time than the recipe called for - it had to cook well over an hour.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this once as written and it was about 3 stars. I liked the idea enough to try it with some changes. This time I added the following: Veggie part: Carrots zucchini and onion to the broccoli and sauteed with more spices. Added spices: Onion powder/garlic powder/sea salt/Oregano Sauce: Added 1 tbl more cornstarch and increased the milk to 3 cups so it would not be watery. Added 1/4 cup fine grated parm then seasoned to taste. Riccota: I mixed 2 eggs and 1/4 cup shredded parm and used Sharp White Chedder instead. Seasoned with some white pepper and fresh ground garlic salt mix (Costco) Layers: I added a little sauce to the veggie mix and made it a separate layer.I think the veggies have too much water in them and make the riccota separate a little and it gets gritty. To fix this I make a layer with just veggies and one with only the riccota mixture. I spread sauce then noodle then veggie mix then noodle and then sprinkle some shredded cheese before putting down the riccota layer and then top with last layer of noodle spread remaining sauce and sprinkle with a little shredded parm and white chedder then sprinkled with some nutmeg or paprika and parsley. Bake uncovered only 30 minutes - too long or hot and the riccota seems to separate. This dish tastes better the next day in my opinion when the noodles soak up the extra liquid and it sets up. I used a 9x13 but there was left over riccota mix to make a bigger pan unless your pan is really deep.",
