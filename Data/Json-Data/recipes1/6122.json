I couldn't find my balsamic vinegar so I used red wine vinegar instead. It was even better the next day. I will definitely bring this to summer picnics and potlucks. Next time I make it which will be very soon I'll use the balsamic and perhaps a touch of freshly ground pepper. Thanks for a great recipe.",

Used only 1 green pepper (all I had) zuchinni instead of cucumber 1 tomato and 1/2 REGULAR onion; marble cheddar cheese instead of monterey jack (again didn't have it). Did not have italian dressing mix so I used a garlic balsamic vinegar that was hanging around in the fridge 1/8 cup of it and 1/8 cup of the vinegar and that was great. But any store-bought liquid italian dressing would work great too. Everyone liked it!",
