My tips for a gorgeous and delicious salad:\n1) don't overcook the pasta. your salad will turn to into a broken mushy mess.\n2) you MUST refrigerate this for at least 4 hours. even if you start with cold ingredients, the flavors must have time to come together.\n3) cheap salad dressing will ruin this dish. go for the good stuff, whatever you use.\n4) the salad is not meant to be \"wet & drippy\". go easy on the dressing. add salad seasoning or spices from your own rack if it needs a kick.\n5) grape tomatoes cut in half and english cucumber keep the salad from getting soggy.\n6) whatever spice you use, stay away from salt. it will make the tomatoes and cucumbers run.\n7) don't be tempted to add too much liquid. your veggies will create more juice and the longer the salad sits, it will get wetter and your noodles will continue to swell.",

Canned diced tomatoes work good in a pinch but will make salad soggy by next day (usually gone the 1st day anyway:) Love to add black olives(sliced or chopped) and shredded cheddar (Kraft FREE again if u want) to the cukes. I omit onion. Color is nice with this combo. of veggies and rainbow rotini noodles. Be sure to shake really good in the bowl with a lid before serving and may need to add more dressing. SOOO good!!",
