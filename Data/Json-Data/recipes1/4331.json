The authentic way to make Cincinnati chili is to get the leanest ground meat possible and simmer it till brown (trust me!) in the water stirring occasionally.  This will break down the meat into the fine texture desired.  After the meat is browned add the rest of the ingredients.  I leave out the steak sauce and add a pinch of powdered clove.  If it's not thick enough just boil it down more or do as we do in Cincinnati and add oyster crackers to soak it up!",

This recipe is supposed to be runny because it's supposed to eaten like Cincinatti chili--with spaghetti noodles on the bottom and topped with cheddar cheese. It doesn't taste exactly like Skyline but it's as close as you're probably going to get. To get a true Skyline meat sauce after the meat is done cooking mix it with some water and put it all in a blender on the low setting. This will chop the meat into very small pieces. Then drain it using a wire strainer and put the meat into the crock pot like usual. This will make the chili very consistent all the way through and will keep there from being big chunks of meat in it just like the real Skyline chili makes it.",

First, the texture of the meat is crucial in making this taste authentic. I browned the meat and ran it through a food processor for about a minute. I honestly feel that the finely ground meat made a huge difference in the flavor. I also used half the amount of cinnamon and added 3 squares of bittersweet chocolate. Because I didn't have 12 hours, I mixed all of the ingredients in a large skillet and let it simmer on the stove for 3 hours. I feel that that was plenty of time, and it tasted great. I served the chili over spaghetti with diced onions and finely shredded cheddar cheese. My husband and I both agree that this is a keeper!  P.S. For those who don't have onion salt on hand, 1 part onion powder and 3 parts salt can be substituted. A woman at a local spice shop told me this, and I figure she knows what she is talking about. :)",
