They came off the grill and dinner wasn't quite ready and the ribs were gone before the rest of the meal was on the table. There were bones everywhere and everyone wanted this recipe. I hadn't brought the recipe but told them where they could find it. It was spicy but the kids ate them without any problems.",

I don't know what it is exactly but it feels like it's almost there but not quite. I don't really like the liquid smoke flavor either so maybe that could be what makes this recipe taste funny. We tend to like sweet bbq sauces but this is not the kind of sweet we are used to (we like Sonny's BBQ's sweet sauce.) I guess we'll keep looking for a recipe that suits our taste better.
