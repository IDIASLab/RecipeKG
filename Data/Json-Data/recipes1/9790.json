We loved this version enough to give it five stars and make it our new pork chop sauce! It came out pretty amazing. First, I melted a big hunk of butter in the saucepan and covered it in my favorite spices (thyme, rosemary, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper). Then I threw in two chopped onions and some minced garlic (all of this sauteing in butter smelled amazing!) Then I threw in a can of sliced mushrooms and put about 4 dashes of dark ale beer in. I let this mixture boil for a couple of minutes, removed it from the skillet & added the pork. I browned the pork for about ten minutes, mixed the sour cream, soups and mushroom mixture together and poured over top. I only simmered everything together for 20 minutes since my porkchops were cut thin. YUM! We were sopping up the sauce with mashed potatoes and everything, it was really good.",

Chops were very tender and putting it in the oven gave the sauce more body. We gave it a 5 with the changes we made.",

I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup 12 ounces of sour cream parsley salt pepper and garlic. I made sure the chops were good and brown on both sides and around the edges before I added the soup mixture. I ended up only having to cook them for 35 minutes once I put in the soup. I had to stay with them and stir frequently. The sauce bubbles up and and \"curdles\" like milk. I also flipped the chops a little more often than 15 minutes. They tended to stick. This made the house smell wonderful. I didn't serve the gravy with the chops. After 30 minutes it was just too thick. The taste of the chops was very good. I think however next time I will toss the whole thing in the slow cooker instead.",
