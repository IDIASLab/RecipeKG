I think it has another egg and maybe more sour cream.  As with traditional southern-style cornbread - before she found this recipe with sour cream and corn, we heat the oven to 450, not 425, and first heat the empty skillet up really hot on the stove top, add a couple of tablespoons of oil, swish it around to coat the pan, toss in a big pinch of cornmeal, swish it around and let brown a little - won't take but a moment, pour the batter in the pan THEN put it in the hot oven and bake until real good and brown.  Nothing better!",

From the ease of the mixing of the batter to the smell it generates in the oven...this IS the best cornbread you'll ever put in your mouth. What else is great about this recipe is you will more than likely have everything on hand to make it. No running to the store to get an ingredient. One thing...follow the direction of some of the other posters either add more cornmeal or less milk.",
