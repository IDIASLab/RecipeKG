I cooked this for an additional 25 minutes hoping that the liquid would cook down but it didn't. Basically I don't think this tasted much different than if I'd just heated all ingredients in a saucepan on top of the stove and then sprinkled with the crackers before serving. I followed this recipe to the letter but I would definitely make some changes if I were to make again. First I'd increase the oven temperature to 375 or even 400. Then I'd cut the butter and oil in half (you really don't need a 1/4 cup of fat to saute the small amount of veggies). Also from a presentation point of view a little bit of butter on top of the crumbs would brown them and make the casserole more eye appealing. And a little bit of salt and pepper wouldn't hurt either. This simply didn't measure up to what I consider scalloped corn. Kitkaty sorry for the harsh review but this just didn't work for us.",
