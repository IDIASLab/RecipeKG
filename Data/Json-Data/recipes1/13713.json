Also, add 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice (this really adds fresh flavor). Quarter the berries to get more glaze flavor mixed through, especially if the berries aren't the ripest.",

It's known as the Shoney's Strawberry Pie at my house because it is SOOO very close to the pie that Shoney's restaurant serves.  I use less water, cornstarch, and sugar than listed here. I do recommend having your water boiling and slowly STIR in the sugar and cornstarch (that you have already measured out and mixed together) otherwise the cornstarch can lump up like lard in the water and become insoluble.",

Gave enough strawberry flavor and sweet, but if I used the whole thing, it would have been too goopy and sweet.  I topped each serving with a little whipped cream.  Yummy!  (If you want to add a layer of custard, mix 1 T. sugar, 1 T. cornstarch, pinch of salt, 1 beaten egg yolk, 1 c. milk, half'n half or cream and heat, stirring constantly until thickens.  Take off burner, add 1 t. vanilla.  Let cool slightly, spread into bottom of pie crust.  Let cool completely before adding strawberries.)",

The glaze mix looked firm enough...but after several hours of chilling I had strawberry pie SOUP! The pie was firmer the next day but then the crust was soggy and the berries were soft. I don't know if it was slicing the berries that did it or if it was the 2 cups of sugar?? It was VERY sweet and almost tasted medicinal. I took another reviewer's suggestion and added lemon juice which really helped to tone down the sweetness. Will probably not make again.",
