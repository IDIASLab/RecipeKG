After reading previous reviews about the cake's heavy texture, I beat my eggs for about 4 minutes until they were thickened, and added 1 tsp. baking powder in addition to the soda; the resulting texture was fluffy and very moist. I reduced the sugar a bit, but next time I'll use the full amount. I would recommend adding a teaspoon of vanilla, and also a tablespoon or two of lemon juice to brighten up the pineapple flavor.

It needs some adjustments, I read all the reviews and follow some sugestions which help me on the good results. It come out delicious! I brought this cake to a family reunion and everyone loves it. In my opinion it just needs 1 cup of sugar,and 1/2 cup of oil. I added 1tsp. of baking powder, 1 tblsp of lemon juice, and 1tsp. of vanilla extract. It only need 20 minutes to cook in the oven, not 45 minutes. I omited the nuts. In the iceing I only put 1/2 of cup of confectioners sugar and it was perfectly sweet. I did this changes and we had an absolutely delicious cake.",

I used 1/2 cup of less of the sugar and I had a fresh pineapple that I had to use up so I just added 1/2 cup of milk to make up for the canned liquid! I didnt even frost it is that good! Frosting would make it even extra amazing! Very moist and very good flavour! Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!",

DELICIOUS! i took it out of the oven at the right time but it wasn't all the way cooked. it was mushy a little in the middle but it made it more moist and it was fabulous! i didn't have cream cheese so i just glazed some cool whip over it! it was great and sweet and moist and i added some pineapple on top for decoration!
