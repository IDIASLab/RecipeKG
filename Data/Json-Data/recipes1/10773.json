The recipe says to pour the mixture over the top of the hashbrowns and although I cooked for the required time, the soups never combined with the potatoes, resulting in crispy, stuck-to-the-pan potatoes on the bottom and cooked soup on the top.  HOWEVER...feeling that this recipe deserved a second chance, I mixed the hasbrowns together and then baxed.  YUMMY.  In addition, since my first disaster, when I have left over ham, I dice it up and throw that in too.  This is a much quicker version of the \"au gratin\" potatoes my mom used to make when they peeled, boiled and cubed potatoes. Now, I just throw in the ingrediants, MIX, cook and serve.

Then I take it out stir it up top with remaining cheese and let it bake until the cheese bubbles. Yum. When I make it for people that don't like onions I just add some onion powder.
