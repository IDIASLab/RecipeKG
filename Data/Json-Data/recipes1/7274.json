I doubled the recipe but only used about a 1/2 c. of sour cream and 1 1/2 c. of mayo with the garlic and curry. Instead of the apples I put in about 6 diced piquante peppers for amazing color and flavor. Wasn't sure about the olives in this but they were great! Highly recommend this.",

Didn't add sour cream mushrooms or yellow bell pepper as I didn't have any on hand. Did add canned baby corn because I had some left over and it sounded good. The result was delicious! I deferred from the original recipe but I'm still giving it 5 stars because it was an interesting and fresh change from boring old macaroni and I think there could be many slight variations to it (next time I may add walnuts and/or raisins) and the creamy curry sauce would still bring it all together. Everyone loved it! Thank you!",
