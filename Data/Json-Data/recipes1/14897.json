The final product was nearly exactly like whole foods. The ingredients are the same, but I changed the measurements and made one substitution.  - 1 teaspoon of molasses NOT 2 tablespoons, the bread is way too dark with the original amount and made the crust a bit bitter. - Increase the honey to 4 tablespoons - Increase pumpkin, sunflower, and millet seeds to 4 tablespoons each - Increase the gluten to 2 tablespoons, this really firmed up the bread and made it less \"cakey\" - I also substituted the 3 tablespoons of malted barley flour with Bob's Red Mill 10 grain cereal.",

Now we just stick with regular barley flour until we can try a new brand of malted. We also follow mhowell's advice by lowering the molasses increasing the honey and increasing the seeds. Overall incredible recipe. Truly the best bread we've ever had either homemade or store bought. We now make it all the time in our bread machine. Our girls ask for it continually. It's more preferred in our family than even the homemade French or Italian breads--and there's nothing like it we can buy anywhere. It's rich and nutty but also light and elastic slightly sweet. We love it with honey butter or cinnamon butter or cream cheese. It's so filling soothing and satisfying and we love that it's complete protein--excellent value for the cost. Also it feels good in the tummy and will sooth a sour stomach which we thought was amazing until we read that millet seed does just that (sooths the stomach). Great way to feel good in the morning and start the day. Thank you thank you for this recipe. It's a staple.",
