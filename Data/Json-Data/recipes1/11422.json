I cut back to 1/2 of a small Vidalia because of an onion-adverse child & didn't have a Granny Smith so used part of a Fuji.

I recently put all the burger ingredients together and fried it like ground beef, put the mixture in the fridge and later mixed it into a bagged salad mix and added drained pineapple tiddbits, boxed crutons and a creamy honey mustard dressing...AMAZING!\n\nDelicious!  It's -40 outside, far to cold to BBQ, so I made these and broiled them in the oven instead.  I also didn't have 2 lbs of pork so I halfed the recipe and made little mini type patties. I did find them a little to wet so I added some bread crumbs.  I served them with a dipping sauce made with a mayonaise base, crushed pineapple, honey, lemon juice and a little seasoning salt.  They were so tasty and so different from the norm. I can't wait till summer so we can try them BBQ'd as well!",

They are incredibly moist and have a fair hint of sweetness to them.  I did not add any breadcrumbs as others have tried.  I only had real problems with 1 of the 5 burgers falling apart on the grill.  Though you do have to be gentle with them.  I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I thought the raw pineapples might make it a tad too sweet so before I put them on the finished patties I lightly browned both sides of the pineapple slices over the stove on a skillet.  I did put a little bit of mayo on the bottom bun.  The only thing I would add next time I make these is some lettuce (I was out dangit) to add some nice crunch and texture which I think would benefit the overall appeal of the burger.  All in all not fantastic but very good and definitely worth making again.  Nice job Kevin!",
