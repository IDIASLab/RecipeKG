I have used this on lean pork chops as well as chicken with excellent results.\r\n\r\nThis is how I use it (adopted from Cook's Illustrated recipe for chops or skinless chicken breasts):\r\n\r\nTake 4 pieces of meat (chop or breast) and brine in a solution of 1 quart water, 1/2 cup kosher salt, 1/2 cup suger for 1 hour. Drain and pat the meat dry. In a 1 gal zip-loc bag, put 2 tablespoons of the dry rub and 2 tablespoons of olive oil (too much olive oil will dilute the spice). Mush the bag around to mix the spices and olive oil. Add the meat to the bag, seal, and toss for a minute to coat. \r\n\r\nOnce coated, place the meat directly onto the grill and grill according to usual meat cooking instructions (5 minutes each side on high heat for the chicken, 3 minutes each side on high heat, followed by 5 minutes on meium-low heat for the chops).\r\n\r\nWe've also used this rub on chicken that we then grill, cut into slices, and use for chicken burritos. The flavors in this spice rub are excellent for mexican dishes. I make a low-carb version of a burrito using large lettuce pieces as my tortilla with guacamole, sour cream, cheese, a few slices of the spiced chicken, and a small bit of salsa  for a truly wonderful dish.",

I scaled the recipe to 9 and it STILL made a ton. We used it on New York strip. I rubbed 1-2 tablespoons of the rub into each steak then lightly coated them with about 1 tablespoon (each) of olive oil (the oil seems to make the steak ALOT jucier...which is my favorite part of a steak!) and let them sit in the fridge for about half an hour. We made them alongside Pan-Fried Asparagus (also on this site) and some Lipton noodles and it was one of the best dinners I have ever made!! I did cut down on the amount of Paprika (because I ran out) and Cayenne (used less than half of what was called for) and it was just perfect. Had a little kick to it but not what I'd call spicy. This is SOOO good you must try it!!:)",
