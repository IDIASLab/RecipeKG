It helps to dissolve the sugar, and to help sugars and butters cream better. Use only 3 cups flour.  Finally, oven temp at 350 and baking cookies for 8-10 minutes keeps it soft.  Lining with parchment paper also helps.  Keep an eye out...they will seem too pale to remove from the oven, but just when the center doesn't look \"wet\" anymore, it is done.  They still bake for 2 or so minutes, so they will darken up a little and be perfect. FYI--when rolling these out, keep the dough nice and thick...the cookie will be crisp (still good)if it is too thin.",

They tasted wonderful with just a bit of colored sugar sprinkled on top.

This is a wonderful sugar cookie recipe that can be used as base for many kinds of cookies.

I do make some recommended changes:  butter instead of margarine, 3 1/3 cups flour and sub 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup powdered sugar for the 1 1/2 cups white sugar called for.  I also use powdered sugar - as opposed to flour - when rolling them out.  These are easy to handle, and hold up FABULOUSLY . . . tasting great even a week later! I use the Sugar Cookie Icing on this site, and they always look amazing.  A side note:  the first time I made these I made a batch of this recipe AND a batch of the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies, and these were by FAR better - both in texture and taste.",

Be sure you don't roll out the dough too thin or they will be a harder crispier cookie. I used Barbara's Butter Icing for Cookies and it was excellent.  These definitely rate 5 stars",

Thanks for the great recipe!!! I just made these again and I had to come back to say that they were perfect using cookie cutters. I followed the recipe exactly except I refrigerated the dough overnight and cooked the cookies for 9 minutes at 350 F. Delicious!",
