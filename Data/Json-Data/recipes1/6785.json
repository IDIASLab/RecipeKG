We didn't have sherry so we substituted Marsallis wine instead. The only thing I would do differently is to use squeeze margarine instead of stick margarine pats on the top. In our pie the margarine pooled together under the broiler then hardened into solid chunks when the pie cooled.",

I definitely think the recipe would be more accurate if there was a cup measurement for the grated jicama. The size varies per jicama. Since I had never cooked with it before, i had no way to know how much it would cook down in the 45 minutes so I used what I thought was reasonable. Thus I had to double the wine and water ratio.  I had too much for the pie shell. I had about 2 cups of raw jicama left over. I had used it before in a salad. To peel the jicama, just go on under the surface and strip it down from there.",
