It made a moist cake but the flavor was weak almost like I had omitted something or done something wrong. (I bake a great deal however I did double-check myself and to the best of my knowledge followed the directions exactly.) The chocolate flavor wasn't very strong at all and was almost over powered by the cinnamon. In my opinion it needs more cocoa powder and possibly some other adjustments. If you are looking for a fudgy brownie or a texas-style chocolate cake this isn't it! The frosting was very good however I had to add more milk to make it thin enough to pour/spread over the cake and everyone agreed the frosting was the best part!! I won't make this again.",
