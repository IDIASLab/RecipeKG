The key is to let them sit for a few hours. They are incredibly addictive! I still believe the crust should be baked first though. I was so excited to try this recipe because I had some jam that needed to be used up. Plus it seemed to have all the right makings for a yummy dessert (hence the name). I was totally disappointed. The bottom crust should have been baked first before putting on the jam. However this wouldn't have helped rescue this recipe because it's just way too sweet.",
