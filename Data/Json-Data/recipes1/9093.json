I thought for sure that someone on the web would have a recipe idea for a salsa. Came across this one and tried it on my husband for breakfast. I used the fresh figs didn't have blanched or enough almonds so I threw the almonds I had plus some pecans into the food processor and added generic chocolate chips. For the orange liqueur I defaulted to Grand Marnier though I'll go for the Cointreau next time. Popped them in the toaster oven and as I'm writing this my husband is stuffing himself two more...Brilliant idea fast elegant. An outstanding selection for someone hosting a dinner party who doesn't want to leave her guests to prepare a complex dessert but wants to serve one.",

I bet fresh figs would be 100 times better. I also recommend serving as soon as they are cool enough to eat.",
