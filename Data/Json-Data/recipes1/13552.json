My boyfriend and I LOVE horseradish and it melds perfectly in this recipe. I will never make deviled eggs any other way. The only reccommendation I have after making these a few times is to drain your relish and horseradish very well before mixing it with the egg yolk. It can make a runny, but still delicious deviled egg otherwise. Also, I don't use the salt and pepper... the eggs have a ton of flavor with out them. Thank you, Sara!",

As I began to mix this up it quickly became apparent that the egg yolks would not just be overpowered by the sweet pickle relish, they would drown in it. I cut it back to barely half the amount called for. I can only imagine that the full amount would have been sickening sweet. I found it necessary to cut back on the horseradish, onion and mustard as well, again to about half the amount called for. The directed amount of mayonnaise was just right.  Ultimately these were fantastic, and even after significantly reducing the amount of relish the sweetness was noticeable, but at least pleasantly so.  Had I strictly adhered to the recipe I have a feeling these would have been tossed. Any flavor of the eggs themselves would have been totally obliterated by that of  pickle relish, horseradish, mustard and onion. We really enjoyed these, but I'm afraid only because I did NOT follow the recipe.",
