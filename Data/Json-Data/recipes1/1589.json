The dough was reasonably easy to work with though it did soften up before I could finish the half batch I made and I had to briefly return it to the refrigerator before continuing. After rolling them out I cut them with a small star cookie cutter. I did not make the frosting with it so I'm not sure how that would have turned out. All in all very good and will make again.",
