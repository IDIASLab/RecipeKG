If you can't make them the right way the first time - try adjusting the ingredients a bit. If they are too sloppy - try cutting down on the butter. (Or add more Marshmallows) use BUTTER - NOT MARGARINE if you want them to come out the right way. If they come out too hard add more butter or don't cook as long. (They almost come out \"candied\" if you cook too long.) We don't \"drop\" these cookies - I use WELL buttered fingers to shape them quickly into Wreaths. you decorate with the Red hots to decorate the Wreath. I put them in all my gift baskets for the Holidays and I actually get requests now for them. Another note to remember - Do NOT put the red hots on with buttery fingers. They will fall off the Wreaths. But you have to get them on before the cookie cools or they will fall off as well. Having a 2nd pair of hands is Great for this. Also be careful - this stuff is VERY HOT when working with it. Don't Burn yourself.",

First off I only used about 45 marshmellows. I heated the butter marshmellows and Vanilla at low heat I removed pot from heat and then added the food coloring and cornflakes. I used a metal spoon and prayed Pam on it for ease of stirring and shaping. I sprayed a cookie sheet with Pam and dropped spoonfuls of the mixture and then quickly added the cinnamon candies. I let them cool off and then put the baking sheet in the refrigerator for about an hour or two. Note: Though to store store individually in plastic wrap so that they won't stick together. They were so beautiful I am making more for my friends as treats. Good luck!!!!",
