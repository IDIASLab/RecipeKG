The first time I made this I used 2 packages cream cheese and one entire can of condensed milk... it lacked the right amount of sweetnesss so I added another 1/2 can. Since the I use only 1 package cream cheese 1 can condensed milk and about 1/2 cup of the reserved liquid from the fruit coctail. Just the right amount of sweetness! Not too thick and not too runny. I don't use bananas. Haven't used any additional maraschino cherries but would recommend adding a can of mandarin oranges (drained) and about 2/3 cup shredded coconut. Typically I use a bulk sized can of fruit coctail (buy at Costco or Smart&Final - you get more for your buck) so I make a lot at once and frigerate the leftovers for dessert the next day or two. Delicious. Enjoy!",
