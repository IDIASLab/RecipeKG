                "reviewBody": "This was excellent. I decided to make this into a cake since that seemed easier to me. I used a greased 9x13inch pan for the pastry baked it at 400 for about 35 minutes then put the filling on top. Because I was doing it this way I used 8 oz softened cream cheese in place of the whipped cream and 3 cups of milk in the filling. This kept it thick enough to cut when it was time for serving. I didn't use the frosting part of the recipe. Instead I topped the filling with whipped topping and drizzled chocolate syrup over it when I served it. It was a hit! FOR THE REVIEWER WHO HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE PASTRY RISING: the ratio of egg to flour is basically the only thing in the pastry that will allow it to rise. The eggs keep the dough moist on the inside while the crust bakes and develops on the outside trapping gas inside. There are two possible causes for the dough not rising. First would be the eggs. When I've made eclairs using old/low quality eggs (you can tell by how spread the white becomes when you crack it) I've often had the same problem. Second if adding the eggs while the dough is still hot like this recipe says to you run the risk of it not rising. Sometimes it works others it doesn't. I recommend cooling the dough completely before adding the eggs one at a time. If you make sure the eggs are fresh and the dough is cool you shouldn't have any problem with your eclairs rising.",
