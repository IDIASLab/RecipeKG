I love the ease of using the pre-sliced mushrooms but we did not care for the texture at all. The mushrooms had a \"rubbery\" texture in my opinion. Neither my husband or I cared for the flavor either. I used balsamic vinegar and the flavor just didn't work for us. It needed something else in my opinion. If I had added some beef broth and a little red wine I think we would have liked it so much better. We scraped the mushroom mixture off the steak and unfortunately ended up throwing it out. If the texture of a frozen mushroom doesn't bother you - I say give it a try but probably add a liquid of some sort to dilute the vinegar taste.",

I used up some venison steaks I had in the freezer and followed the rest as directed. I was pleasantly surprised. My mushrooms were satisfactory to us as frozen goes and did not have a weird texture to them - and I'm a picky person when it comes to that. That leaves me to question the freshness of the product others received. If I make this again I think I would leave out the vinegar just a personal preference. Overall it was quick easy and somewhat healthy meal. I served it with a garden salad and cheesy cauliflower.",
