I didn't even have a butter mix in fact I had probably the cheapest mix on the market...a yellow cake mix from ALDI'S and they still came out wonderful. I also had a store brand butterscotch pudding (3.5 oz) so I did remove a tbsp. of the flour. Just tossed in a combo of choc. chips and M&Ms. What I loved about this recipe is that the dough is not sticky and therefore can be shaped so uniformly. A great recipe even with cheapo cheapo ingredients. A snap to whip up. In my case SUPER-DUPER economical cookie to give to the neighbors. I would recommend waiting a minute or so before removing from the sheets.",
