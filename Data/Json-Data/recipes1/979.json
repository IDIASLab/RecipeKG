In my hurry, however, I didn't bother to read any of the reviews before I started and wish I had. I would have learned that other than using oil instead of butter, this is the same recipe as \"Best Brownies,\" also from this site. (I happen to love that recipe!)  In that recipe, however, an 8x8\" pan is used.  No wonder these turned out so thin, as others have noted! I used the 9x9\" pan this recipe called for and while I was pleased with the brownie itself, which was moist, fudgey, with a bit of a crispy edge, I was disappointed in how thin they turned out. Unfortunately, that was a deal breaker for me as it made for a rather unimpressive looking brownie. Also, I found 18 minutes baking time perfect, so it's no wonder others found these dry if they were baking them for the recommended 20-25 minutes! Good brownie ingredients-wise, but somewhat flawed directions in terms of both pan size and baking time.",

I will be making them in the future. Thank-you for a great recipe!!",

                "reviewBody": "This is the recipe I've been using to bake brownies for well over a decade now, even before I attended culinary school!  I notice the latest reviewer complained about the gritty taste of the sugar in the product.  I suggest she try either butter or if she wants to cut out butterfat in her diet, use a 1/4 cup of butter and make the rest vegetable oil, or stick to all vegetable oil, but do the following anyway:  Microwave it for 1-2 minutes or until it melts(or oil is warmed).  Add the sugar to the warm/hot butter/oil, and this melts the sugar.  Better yet, try honey! I've also taken out as much as a half cup of sugar out of the recipe, and it works fine.  Microwaving or heating the oil causes the sugar to melt slightly, and if she uses a wire whisk to mix, it can also help to blend the butter, sugar and eggs together more smoothly.  Don't ever give up on a recipe after one try, because it's not a fair assessment of it.  Anything can cause a recipe to \"fail\" (the temps outside, the oven too hot/cool, not familiar with the recipe) in the first try.  I urge her to try again, and maybe try some of my tips.",

I used my glass 8x8 baking dish, added 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips mixed into batter, and did use another reviewer's suggestion of melted butter instead of vegetable oil. \nAlso, since my pan was 8x8, I knew they would be a little thicker than the 9x9 would produce so I increased the baking time to 30 minutes exactly. OMG, I swear by this recipe and I've tried many homemade ones and ALL boxed versions. If you haven't tried this, do yourself a favor especially now around Valentine's Day....TRY THIS RECIPE!!

I didn't change a thing and they came out so incredibly fudgey. The only time I can get a brownie to be this fudgey moist is if I use 1 cup of butter...so this is much more economical to make without compromising flavor. Great Great recipe!!! thanks so much. If one likes an incredibly fudgey moist brownie this is a great one. I used a 9x6? pan. I don't see why an 8x8 couldn't be used. May just have to bake a few more minutes.",
