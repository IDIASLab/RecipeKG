We subbed beer for the wine, used a tablespoon of crushed red pepper (we like 'em hot!) and since we were having clams as well we wanted this to be a red sauce.  I added a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes  and doubled the butter.  I let the sauce cook a bit to thicken and then added the mussels.  So good!  Loved the sauce over some linguine.

Poor dear was getting squishy - oh well, cut  off the weird stuff and use the rest! I tasted first, it was divine),\nadded 1/2 pound of fresh shrimp with shells still on - backs cut with scissors to make for easy peeling later but not de-veined,\n3/4 of a medium summer squash- diced into 1/2 in cubes (this might've been too small, oh well),\nabout 1/2 of the wine replaced with distilled water,\nI didn't have parsley but I had a ton of sorrel (again, starting to get sad. We tend to play favorites with vegetables, running out of kale but never eating the other greens!) so I took about 3/4 of a big bundle and roughly sliced across to make ribbons. Dropped some in at the end - got a bit brown and strange looking but added a wonderful toothy brightness to vegetable bites that lemon couldn't capture alone.\n\nThe result? Fantastic! A medley of bright vegetables in a light, mildly tomato sauce. I meant to add cream but forgot! It was still delectable. Must be served with a big bowl for shells (both mussel and shrimp). What to do with the shells? Bury them in the yard, I suppose!",

Anyone that loves seafood, has traveled some and has experienced a \"Legal Seafood\" restaurant in Boston knows what I'm saying. I only made half of this recipe. I live in Colorado at an elevation of 6,800 feet and it only took 2 minutes for the mussels to open, I expected that it would take much longer than that yet the mussels were done perfectly. Being that I only made half of the original recipe amounts, I found that 1 cup of a nice white wine was too much. I suggest that anyone that makes this entree as written for 2 servings to only use 1 cup of wine instead of the 2 cups that is called for.",

What does make this dish is the lemon zest and wine, which needs to be a chardonnay with a good oak finish. I tried with a  Pinot Grigio and it was too fizzy.  And go big with the butter using a stick. It's not like you eat all of it as much is left in the juice you discard. And take time with the letting the ingredients really saute and blend together the medley of flavors before adding the mussels.  And these heat up really well as left overs with the broth in a saucepan the next day.  I found the best economical wine to use is Kirkland's Chardonnay. Like they say, if you won't drink it, don't cook with it.  Good luck!",
