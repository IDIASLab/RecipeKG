I tend to simplify things so I use a package of imitation lobster in place of the crabmeat and frozen cooked and peeled shrimp. I use extra onion. But the real secret...I use all heavy whipping cream instead of the half-and-half and the wine. It's already low-carb but by using the heavy cream, you can almost eliminate the need for the flour, making it even lower in carbs! Silky smooth and rich. I love this stuff!",
