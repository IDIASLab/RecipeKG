I've made Jezebel Sauce before and also purchased some at our Renaissance Fair......it's good stuff! Kind of habit-forming! But the recipe I followed had fewer ingredients only apricot preserves and orange marmalade along with the horseradish. And Geri's right it's great as a dip/spread served over cream cheese. I'll try this one soon and write back.",
