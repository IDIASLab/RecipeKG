And seasoned the pot with basil, rosemary and thyme. Then, I added a can of Wye River crab soup at the end and heated through. Oh my gosh -- my husband thought he'd died and gone to heaven! ",

Only things I did different, I doubled the recipe to make a large pot, so I used 2 large cans of stewed tomatoes, ( I love tomatoes too) 2 heads of cabbage, and added a splash of olive oil.  This turned out great! If you like a little more sauce or just love tomatoes, I recommend adding the extra stewed tomatoes. I served this over homemade mashed potatoes, and just served right out of a bowl without anything, and had many compliments. I could eat this dish every day! I will definitely use this recipe very often! Thanks Kim ",
