I have made dozens of these crusts for friends and family and consistently get rave reviews.  I make them in batches, bake them and put them on waxpaper lined pieces of cardboard and use my Foodsaver to protect them in the freezer.  Pop one out on the fly, load it up with your favorite toppings which should be prepared ahead of time as you will not be baking this pizza for much longer after you top it.  I agree that you really need to remove as much liquid from the cauliflower prior to working it into the mix. I put the steamed material inside a large cheesecloth and squeezed the ba-boo-boo out of it. The only deviation I made from the original recipe is to add about 1/4 cup coconut flour to the mixture to further absorb whatever liquid didn't come out during the squeeze.  You will love this crust!",
