A couple of minor changes I made was I used 4 eggs instead of 3, I am SURE I didn't use a full cup of milk (probably more like 1/2 cup), and no nutmeg. I used a little bit of garlic powder in the eggs along with the salt and pepper. It was SO good!! You could really change this up a lot with different cheeses and veggies. My 2.5 and 3.5 year olds LOVED this!! I was so surpised! And my choosy husband said I should definitely make this again. I think it's a keeper!!",

To save on time, I used Betty Crocker's garlic instant mashed potatoes and baked the crust without the filling for about fifteen minutes, to avoid the soggy bottom crust other reviewers mentioned. I left out the nutmeg, but used a little onion and garlic powder, along with a dash of cayenne for a bit of zip. I've made this with both broccoli and spinach.

I baked for the 30 mintes until edge only was brown . I omitted Broccoli & made \"denver\" style . I sauted onion, mushroom and green pepper. I mixed eggs with half-n-half , changed salt to garlic salt & tossed in the ham , Pepper & nutmeg. Baked 35 and let set. My family ate the whole thing. Anna H.",

It is a long process to make the meal, but you can steam the broccoli at the same time you make the potatoes, and when those are baking, I made the egg/milk mixture and set aside in the fridge until I was ready to put it all together.  All the steps were easy, just time consuming, but you can clean up in between each and at the end it is all in one dish.  I made this for only myself and my husband, and we devoured more than half at dinner and reheated the rest for lunch the next day.  A few minutes to heat through in the toaster oven, and it was almost better the second day!  It really hit the spot!!!!!",

My decidedly finicky boyfriend pronounced it 'delicious' - several times! The crust was very like mashed potato; no crispiness and didn't hold together though I think this would be greatly improved if I had a metal pie dish instead of a pottery one; will update when I've bought one and tried it again!! Recommended variations: a teaspoon of wholegrain mustard added to the crust; 4-8 rashers of smoked bacon fried in their own fat drained and mixed in with the broccoli (non-veggie version obviously...)",
