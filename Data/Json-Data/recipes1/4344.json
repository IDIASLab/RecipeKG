I even pre baked the first layer 10 minutes (trying to get it distinct) and it was still very soft. And with the temperature my crust was toast. Totally crunchy black. I set my timer and backed off the oven and the timer went off before I made it to 350... I'm an ammateur baker... well.. beginner is more like it so I don't know how to fix the firmness the distinction or the blackening of the crust but I'm probably not going to be showing off this particular pie for dinner anymore.",
