I halved the recipe because it was only for 2 people, but as other people suggested I doubled the amount of dirty rice mix (so in my case I used 1 box of the mix).  Even with making only 1/2 the recipe, I still had plenty of rice leftover--it will make great lunches along with the leftover cornbread.  The changes I made included adding some green and yellow bell peppers, as well as 3 cloves of crushed garlic.  I also doubled the amount of tomatoes with chilis, as I like tomatoes and spicy food.  Also, since I am a vegetarian, I used meatfree \"ground beef\" & spicy \"sausage\" (I use Morningstar Farms, which tastes so much like the real thing that no one believes it is vegetarian and totally meat free!).  This was really good, and I will definitely be making this again!",

They are very picky when it comes to things claiming to be \"Cajun\" as most of them are. Here's a comparison my heart sank when one of the LA co-works made home-made dirty rice. I figured mine would not be touched since it came from a 'box'. However not true this recipe was eaten up first before the original. However I was informed true dirty rice uses chicken gizzards/liver. Not ground beef. But they loved it just the same. So I recommend this recipe. It's a good one! (I will leave out the tomatoes/green chili's next time - I just didn't like it and I did not add the beans either)",
