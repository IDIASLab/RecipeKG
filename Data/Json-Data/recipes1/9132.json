Do not store uneaten salad (unless the mango has been left out) D. Add a little garlic powder and half the coconut extract to the dressing and last by not least try adding some finely minced red onion. Great salad when above steps are followed. Thanks Robyn",

After the salad sits for a little while the enzymes in the mangoes turn the chicken to mush and make the mayo all watery. The coconut extract was pretty overpowering as well. If you make it try cutting back on the coconut season it with salt and pepper (it NEEDS some more flavor) and don't add the mayo and mangoes to the rest of it until you're ready to serve it.",

I didn't have celery but I did have a can of water chestnuts. This recipe still calls for celery. I dehydrate a lot of foods for the pantry so I added a tsp of my celery powder and a tsp of crushed dried celery leaves for flavor. Another review said this salad needed onion so I minced up some leftover onions from last night's BBQ and added about 2 Tbs for some crunch and flavor. I didn't have mango and other reviewers said it caused problems in storage so I skipped it. I used crushed canned pineapple pressed dry; it yielded just shy of a cup. No canned mandarin oranges but I have dehydrated mandarines (they taste like orange licorice) so I chopped up a couple Tbs and added them. I used the recommended sour cream and mayo and a generous twist from the salt grinder to bring out the flavors. After sitting in the refrigerator about 7 hours I tested it with some crackers. Good. Not good enough to make again but a great save of a rotisserie chicken and using what I had on hand.",
