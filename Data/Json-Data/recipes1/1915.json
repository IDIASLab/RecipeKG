I couldn't find fresh strawberries OR sliced frozen ones at my grocery store so I used frozen unsweetened mixed berries to mix in. Delicious! Not too sweet yum. The only resaon I am not giving this 5 stars is because in the freezing process the pie filling got a little crystally...It was kinda wierd. Maybe next time I will try mixing in some gelatin so I don't have to put it in the freezer to set up. Thanks for the recipe!!!",

I used five 100g yogurt cups instead of the two packs of 8oz. The flavours I chose were strawberry chantilly (X3) and raspberry-cranberry crumble (X2). I also used sliced bananas (three) instead of strawberries; I drenched some in lemon juice for the topping to avoid browning. I found the base recipe makes enough filling for two pies but since I only had one crust I saved the rest for another dessert. I also skipped the whip ped topping on the top of the pie as there was aready enough in it. Next time I will incorporate some coconut into this as I think it would compliment this pie nicely.",
