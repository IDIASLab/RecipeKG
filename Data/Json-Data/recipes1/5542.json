This recipe is almost exactly her recipe.  I doubled the spices (except the cinamon and salt) and added about 1 tbs of corriander.  I eyeballed the olive oil and I added a bit of beef broth to the mixture near the end because I like my curry more runny.  You wouldn't want to add the broth in the end if you don't.  I sauteed lamb pieces in olive oil and cumin prior to putting in with the veggies.  I served over basic cous cous and it's almost exactly her recipe without taking 2 full days to prepare.  Thank you so much!",

I despise eggplant, so I added an extra sweet potato and an extra zucchini, and it was fabulous, fabulous, fabulous. I do not add salt, and I used canned low-sodium garbanzo beans to cut back on the sodium. My neighbors smelled this cooking from next door, and ended up staying for dinner. The smell is indescribably intoxicating, not to mention the TASTE! This is definitely a keeper. Yes, you will be chopping until your arms want to fall off, but so what? The end result is worth it, thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!",

                "reviewBody": "Found this recipe by ingredient searching for something to do with eggplant.  So glad I did.  It was excellent.  I did make a few changes.  Forgot to get a sweet potato, so I used red potatoes.  Doubled curry powder and cinnamon using 1 TBSP sweet curry powder and 1 TBSP spicy.  Lessened salt to 1/2 tsp.  Doubled almonds.  Added 1/4 cup finely diced ginger.  Next time would increase raisins to 1/3 or 1/2 a cup as they provide a pleasing sweet element.  Next, to account for people saying some veggies were too hard while others were overcooked I started my Dutch oven with 3 TBSP oil and the spices.  Next added carrot, onion and potatoes cooked 3-4 min.  Added OJ, raisins, and chickpeas.  Cooked 10 min.  Then added all veggies except spinach.  Cooked 10 min. while I made couscous.  Stirred in spinach and cooked 5 min.  Added 1/2 a lemon juiced at end to brighten as curry powder always has a base flavor to me that needs an acid to contrast with it.  All veggies were perfect and it was delicious.  This way the eggplant sucks up all the good juice and spices rather than just oil.  Added extra 1/2 cup of OJ as it needed more.  Must say spinach was from the farmers market and made a big difference in taste.  Definitely will make again!",
