I'm sure it would've turned out nicely if I did have more creme on hand though. While it didn't turn into fudge it did happen to turn into a nice mouse like texture-- and it's still very yummy. I plan on serving it in wine glasses with some whip cream! While I prefer fudge made with condensed milk for its richness this makes a light and chocolatey treat.",
