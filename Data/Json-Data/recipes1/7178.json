You don't have to brown beef or cook noodles ahead of time - just put it together and pop it in the oven! I always make it exactly like instructed. One tip to make it even simpler - instead of measuring out or buying the spices just add a packet of taco seasoning mix.",

Instead of the seasonings I added two pkgs. of taco seasoning and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and a pinch of cayenne pepper. I made 3 layers instead of two.(15 noodles). I also added about a quarter of a cup of chunky salsa to the beef itself to make it just a littlt bit moister. Instead of piquante sauce I again used the salsa.I used four cups of cheese instead of three. One cup between each noodle layer and one for the top the during the last 5-10 minutes of cooking time. It is important to let the lasagne rest about 20 minutes to allow for easier cutting. Excellent!!!",
