They are not hard to make once you get the hang of it and I think Rosina gave perfect instructions. One variation you can try is to wrap each fully-formed square log (which already has the two chocolate and two plain logs in it) in a sheet of either plain or chocolate dough before then wrapping in foil and refrigerating overnight. (I make a double batch of cookies just for the extra \"wrapping dough.\") The finished cookies will then have a border around the checkerboard pattern which looks very sophisticated!",

If rolling the dough out use powdered sugar on the rolling pin/countertop. 4. For even more fun I made 1/2 batch of Chocolate Frosting I and made cookie sandwiches. These were so much fun to make look fabulous and taste great (the frosting added the perfect amount of sweetness).",

                "reviewBody": "1. The recipe didn't give explicit directions for how to make the logs (essential for the slower variety as yours truly): after dividing the dough I found it helpful to refrigerate it for a while before attempting to make the logs as the dough is too soft and pliable at room temperature. Once the logs are made they go back into the fridge to firm up and then to be cut evenly into smaller logs. However mine still didn't come out as pretty and proper as the photo submitted by Jersey Tomato:( 2. I found the sugar to be a tad bit less (despite the fact that I usually prefer things a little less sweet - American chocolates like Snickers make my mouth hurt!!) 3. For tea/coffee aficionados I would suggest cutting these to 1/8 inches and baking them till crisp (maybe around 7 minutes?) to get perfect biscuits to serve with tea and coffee - the kind you find in cafes in Europe.",

All it takes to make these cookies is two days. The first day: make dough refrig. for 2 hours--then cut up into square strips and stack along side of eachother (9 total per block). Then refrig. over night and it is easily slice-able and quick to bake in the morning. I gave these 4 s because they really aren't THAT tasty-- a bit bland.. you'd be better off using just a sugar cookie recipe instead. oh and USE semisweet chocolate NOT bittersweet.. tastes strange that way",
