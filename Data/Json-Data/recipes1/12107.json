I also added some onion.  I kept with other ingredients (as well).  I used extra sharp cheddar & peppercorn jack.  I did not use the mozerella.  I lightly brushed top with bread crumbs.  Drizzled a little butter and topped with a little extra shredded cheddar.  It was an amazing texture.  Looked so & smelled so yummy!  Unfortunately, it was ruined when I followed baking instructions.  I thought 45 mins to an hour sounded a bit much, but followed instructions.  What a mistake!  I think it baked out the flavor along with the creamy texture.  20 min baking time, more realistic.  If you want crunchy on top, broil for about 3 mins after 20 mins of baking.  I might try making this again with major baking changes.  Oh yeah, after cooking noodles to al dente (about 7 mins) make sure you rinse in luke warm/cold water to prevent further cooking of pasta.  That's the secret to all pasta based casseroles!",

This is it!!!  I left out the ham, used 12 oz macaroni since there is a lot of sauce, and added a teaspoon each of ground mustard and worcestershire sauce for extra flavor.  I also added some melted butter to bread crumbs and crumbled over the top for a nice crispiness.  It was sooo GOOD!!!  Thanx Allie!!!!",

Instead of using cubes of the three different kinds of cheeses I used 4 cups of Kraft Classic Melts Four Cheese (American Wisconsin Sharp Cheddar Vermont White Cheddar and Monterey Jack). It is shredded and didn't take long at all to melt. Also I didn't let the roux cook for 1-2 minutes. As soon as the roux started to bubble I slowly added the milk. Instead of cayenne I added 1/3 tsp. of chili powder. And I only cooked it for 35 minutes - I noticed that if I had let it cook any longer it would have dried out the top part. Thanks Alyson for a great recipe!",

I did not use mozzarella at all but used 7.5 oz of both the Cheddar and Jack (shredded not cubed).  I also used milk and 1/2 & 1/2 not just milk, and I added more cayenne pepper.

I try to make it at least once a month; if I don't I am sure to be reminded and asked! I omit the ham because I don't eat red meat. Once in while I will add crispy turkey bacon for that meaty flavour. The three cheeses are a nice combination but I find it tastes excellent with just sharp cheddar and jack cheeses. Depending on my mood sometimes I alternate chili powder for cayenne. They both work well. Sometimes I dare to use half cream (or half & half) and half milk. Eight bites makes this a meal! Especially excellent in winter. Excellent recipe Allie! A definite keeper and permanant addition to my \"usuals.\"",
