If I could rate the taste I would say more like two stars. I'm sure their is a better recipe out there. But really are we making this recipe for the taste? I don't think so.",

The effect is what got (and held) their attention. OK modified the recipe a bit and made the dough a bit moister cut back on the honey a bit and threw in a little brown sugar. Served in a new clean litter pan with a new clean scoop. I also microwaved a few long Tootsie Rolls and stuck them in the Grape-Nuts and \"hung\" 2 of the Tootsie Rolls over the edge of the box for that extra-special visual touch. The girls wouldn't touch them but the boys were crazy about them. I didn't add coconut or ramen noodles though that would have been too much for me! Will make again although for the effect rather than culinary merit;-)",

I broke the pretzels to make them all different sizes as well. Hahaha people loved them! I made them the night before and covered them with foil and just put them in the fridge to harden a bit about 2 hours before the party.",
