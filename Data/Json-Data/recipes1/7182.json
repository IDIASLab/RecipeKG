Certainly more celery and onion as well as other fresh veggies to give it the texture and flavor good vegan/vegetarian food can have!",

For instance do you use unsalted or salted sunflower seeds? If you do use salted as I did it will become too salty. I wish I had tasted the paste and added the soy sauce ONLY if necessary. On the celery stalk do you use the celery including the leaves? I omitted the leaves out until the end to see if I would need to add it in. It did need the whole celery WITH the leaves maybe even a bit more. I felt the paste needed more lemon juice than called for maybe even a full cup. This may be due to the recipe being too salty though.",
