I used cabbage on the bottom (yummy cooked in the meat juices) spinach red onion potato and baby bellas on top. I used olive oil on the bottom and poured a little more on top. Salt and black pepper and a little hot sauce completed the picture. An hour at 425f in the oven was perfect! I'll be making this again with different ingredients and spices. Thanks for a great idea!",
