I live in Colorado and it only takes 30 minutes, just something to keep in mind for your elevation.  It will scorch here in 40 min. Someone said the cake had too much of a flour taste. Not true if you follow the directions and remember what elevation you're at.  Take it from me, this is an awesome recipe.  A friend said it wasn't sweet enough. It calls for unsweetened cocoa and that's what you get. It's also a flavor my family likes.  If you want it sweeter then use a sweet cocoa. Whatever kind of cocoa you put into this recipe is the kind of flavor you will get.  It just makes sense.  It will be good whatever you use. Just remember to use the exact measurement of ingredients it calls for, you can't go wrong.  So, I'm thanking you for this recipe!  It's awesome and just asking others to remember where you live and what ingredients work for your elevation.  I sign off as old hand at baking and trying to give sound advice.",

I just finished a piece, and this \"cake\" turned out to be exactly what I wanted it to be: light but still chocolatey, gooey, and so delicious! It's not like a full-fat dessert thats extremely rich and heavy. My alterations: upped the cocoa to 1/3 cup, little extra vanilla for flavor, a hand-full of chocolate chips, and used hot milk instead of water.  Make and enjoy!!",
