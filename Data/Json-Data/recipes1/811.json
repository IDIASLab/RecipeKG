I've made them with Cheerios and regular crispy rice cereal. And I use up to 10 cups of cereal if I have it on hand. Line your pan with parchment paper (not wax paper as it will stick to the bottom of the bars) and there's no need to place them in the fridge to solidify. Cookie cutters work on the crispy rice version. Be sure to store them in a air-tight container or they will get tough. Not that that will keep them from being eaten.:)",

I cut the sugar down to 3/4 of a cup so they did not get too sweet. I also cooked the sugar syrup mixture past the point of bubbles and instead until it foamed (2-3 min past boiling). It gave the mixture more of a soft caramel texture. These were fantastic! A great way to use up leftover cereal.",
