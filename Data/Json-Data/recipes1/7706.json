Even though I love this recipe I have discovered some of the things that make it not go so well. 1) Don't add too much beer it will ruin the texture and make the flavor really bitter. 2) What type of beer you use makes the dip a hit or success. Amber Ale and regular light beers have always worked well but I would avoid wheat beers and stouts. 3) Light cream cheese has a negative effect on the overall flavor and texture as well but one package light and one package regular seems just about right.",

We've had it twice and will be having many more times to come! As of 10/26/06 I have made this numerous times now. My husband even wants it at home quite often and complains when we run out! I didn't take it to a tailgate that we decided to do breakfast for though. I was told that from now on if I don't bring it I would be banned from my own tailgate! Because everyone likes it so much, I now have to times everything by 5 as our tailgate neighbors come over for some too! I've also used various beers to find the perfect one. The best one I've used is Miller Lite. As good as it is already, it was a little better with this. I think I've given this recipe to more people than I have with any other ever! Thank you so very much for the perfect football tailgate dip!",
