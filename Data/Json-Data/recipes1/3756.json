Instead of cooking the green and red peppers along with the onions and carrots I roasted them by slicing in half lengthwise and placing them in the pre-heated broiler for a few minutes on each side until charred. Then let the pieces cool a few minutes before chopping them up to add into the soup along with the water. I also eliminated the dry potato flakes and used a large Yukon Gold diced and cooked with the onions and carrots. And I added just a little extra of each seasoning listed. This was a knock-out soup and so easy to make! Thanks Margo!",

I roasted red and yellow peppers (didn't use green) used 4 carrots added a can of green chilis can of cream style corn subsituted 1 can of fat-free evaporated milk instead of half-and-half to lighten it up.

I didn't have any peppers that day so I substituted a slice celery rib and I added a 14 oz can of creamed corn after softening the vegetables. Instead of 3 c water used 2 c water 1 chicken broth 3/4 cup skim milk powder. And reduced the potato flakes to 1 c. It was very good. Will make this again. You probably don't need to change anything in the original recipe but I think that the creamed corn helps and I would use whatever broth you have on hand for part of the water required.",
