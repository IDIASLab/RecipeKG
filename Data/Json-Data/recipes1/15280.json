I used splenda walnuts and dried berries (cranberries cherries and blueberries). I reconstituted the berries in warm water for several minutes to plump them up. I did have to add a splash more milk because the dough was a bit crumbly. Also I didn't want to wait to chill them the oven was already hot from baking biscuits. So I just pinched off a chunk of dough rolled it into a ball them smushed the ball flat patted it on both sides with the cocounut and baked. Next time I'll chill the bowl of dough in the freezer for about 10 min. first because the dough was a little soft but I managed okay and they came out nicely. I would definitely make these again.",

The dough was easy to handle and get into the 3 rolls. I'll make them again.",

Doubled the vanilla and put some cinnamon on the second batch as well as making little balls and squashing them flat. Kudos from everybody and lots of requests for my \"seat of the pants recipe\".",
