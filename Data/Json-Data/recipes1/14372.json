I used 1.5t minced garlic and a dash of salt and pepper in place of the garlic pepper (I didn't have any). I completely drained the artichokes but still ended up with some liquid in the pan (I'm puzzled where it came from), but it may have helped to flavor the chicken. Company-worthy or a nice change of pace for everyday fare. Excellent post!\r\n\r\n01/10/05 - Made this AGAIN and realized that the water is definitely coming from the artichokes. I squeezed them before chopping and extracted a lot more liquid. You simply got to use marinated artichokes to capture that extra flavor! We also sliced the chicken breasts into strips, and added 5 pieces of precooked bacon (heated & crumbled) to the artichoke mixture. Simply FANTASTIC! I've NEVER rated a recipe twice - this is that good!! Just drain and squeeze the artichokes and your water problem will disappear!",

I just made this as-writte, with the full amount mayo, and it's really really oily, and leaves an aftertaste.  I still love this recipe and will  make it again, but you really need to swap out some of the mayo for sour cream. With that change, it's fabulous. Once again, thanks for sharing :)",

I did use marinated artichokes as others suggested. I also sprinkled a little Italian Bread Crumbs over the top and then sprayed with Butter cooking spray to get it to \"crisp the top\" I baked mine for 40 minutes in a 375 oven. I served the chicken on top of whole wheat egg noodles. Juicey, Tastey....no left overs!!!!",

We removed the onion and then sauteed a 1/2 pound of fresh sliced mushrooms with 3 cloves of minced garlic. We halved  two chicken breasts thickness wise to make four breast servings. We buttered a shallow glass baking dish and layered the bottom of the dish with a bag of pre washed baby spinach. We placed the halved breast on top of the layer of spinach and topped each breast with caramelized onions and mushrooms. We drained two 12 oz. jars of marinated artichokes reserving a 1/4 cup of the marinade. We drizzled the reserved marinade over the spinach, breasts, caramelized onions and mushrooms. We then covered each breast with the recipe mixture of mayo, parmesan cheese, marinated artichokes and garlic pepper. Lastly, we VERY LIGHTLY sprinkled cayenne pepper over the dish. Baked at 375 for 50 minutes or until the topping is golden. OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!",

It has never failed to receive rave reviews and my guests think I spent hours in the kitchen. There is so much flavor that it needs to be served with a simple salad with a light tasting dressing like Newman's olive oil & vinegar, and some fresh asparagus and yum, yum, yummo. I've used the powdered parmesean in a pinch and it's still good. If you're needing all that change, perhaps it's your choice of mayonnaise. The salt/pepper should go directly on the chicken before pouring over the topping.",
