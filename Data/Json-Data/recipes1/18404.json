I had all the moms and even a grandpa asking me for this recipe! 5 Stars!",

One of them even commented that it looked like I spent a lot of time on it. (How nice!) This looks & tastes so good with not much more effort than just frosting. I didn't use all the chocolate & even after letting it cool for 7 minutes it was still too liquefied & drizzled down the edges of the cake. No complaints though. Might only use 1/2 the suggested amount next time which apparently will be very soon! I'm also thinking about what other flavors of cake mix to use... maybe yellow? Of course it wouldn't like an Oreo but as long as it tastes good: )",
