If it is a problem leave them in the oven a bit longer before removing to frost and a little shorter oven time after. The melted topping is a real plus.",

Instead of dipping the cookies in egg white I rolled the balls in colored sugars for Christmas. Then I made the indentations and followed the rest of the recipe. Kind of like a cookie with a cheesecake flavored icing. Thank you for posting the recipe.",
