I went to an apple orchard and got jonathan apples and scaled back on the water called for to 5 cups and increased my apples to 24 cups as orchard apples tend to be juicier.) I found this out by trial as my first batch came out a little heavy on the sauce and light on apple pieces.  By doing this, my apple pie cut into neat pieces (when it cooled) without all that sauce oozing out onto the pan between slices. (Since you have decreased the water, you should also decrease your cornstarch by 1/3) I like this recipe so much that I have made 4 batches of this pie filling to freeze so I have it all winter.  This was a 5 star winner on taste, texture, appearance, how it made my house smell, how much my kids loved it, althought they hated peeling all those apples. A definate recipe to use over and over and over...and to pass down to your kids.",

Our biggest mistake was not beginning the 6-8 minute cooking period immediately after apples were added to sauce (we overcooked).  That first attempt began our new tradition of apple topping !  YUMM-O!  Next we made the filling as other reviewers (24 cup apple & 5 Cup water), and lowered sugar since we were not using Granny Smith.  We began timing apple cooking IMMEDIATELY upon adding apples to sauce and only cooked 6 minutes which left apples firm - Now we have perfection!  THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERUL RECIPE!",

I cut the water in half and for that half used 1/2 apple juice - 1/2 water. I also decreased the sugar by a cup and slightly increased the cornstarch because there is nothing I hate more than a watery pie! Everything smelled and tasted delicious. I lined 6 foil pie plates with saran wrap, then portioned out the filling. Into the freezer they go, then when frozen I'll pop them out, wrap them up and when its time to bake I can place the pre-formed filling in the crust and bake. The foil plates are slightly smaller than a traditional pie plate, so the fit is perfect.",

I took the advice of others and reduced the water to 6 cups water to 12 cups apples. In a peach filling recipe on the website, they suggested to freeze the peaches in a foil lined pie plate with foil on top. When it froze, remove it from the plate. Cook in oven at 425 degrees on the bottom rack then lower the temperature. I tried this with this apple pie filling and it was marvelous. I look forward to another apple pie this holiday.
