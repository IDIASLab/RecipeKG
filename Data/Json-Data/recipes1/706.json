They tasted lovely - nice with a cup of tea!.Children really loved them. They kept quite nicely in an air tight tin for three days. Would make again. My husband enjoyed his with some vanilla ice cream. Oh and make sure you take them out of oven when EDGES are turning golden brown as they cook faster on the bottom and may burn without you realising!!!!",

The rest of the measurements were so hard to understand (5/8 tbs, etc) that I gave up trying to measure them and just threw stuff in. Too bad the flour already had salt in it, cause after I put the salt in it was almost unbearably salty. To balance this out, I had to add more flour (of a different kind, this time whole wheat) to try to dilute the taste. But then it got too dry, and as I was out of butter I added random amounts of soymilk and grapeseed oil in small increments. I didn't have lemon flavoring either so I poured almond extract in there. Also, I tried to add lemon zest but couldn't find the gratey thing so I used a fork which didn't work. Eventually I had to peel the stuff off with my fingernails, but they were too big so I put them in a garlic squisher thing, which didn't work as they're flat, so I had to tear up each flake of lemon peel by hand which took about an hour. I got impatient with rolling the dough into balls so i just took big hunks of the stuff and put balls of random sizes on the pan with some coconut flakes on top. It came out great and tasted like lemon scones. This recipe didn't work at all!",
