I always add some coarse ground garlic salt ground black pepper and basil. Now that it's summer I've been adding a bit of fresh basil but usually I use dried. Both are good. I use halved grape tomatoes instead of diced big tomatoes. I also grill a couple of chicken breasts marinated in italian dressing and cube them into the salad. I like to toast some pine nuts and toss them in just before serving too. I always make this dish the night before I plan to serve it. It makes a HUGE difference. If it comes out a bit too dry for you just increase the vinegar and oil. I add a couple Tablespoons of water to my balsamic vinegar because it's slightly strong for me but my mother loves it before I add the water. Great recipe for picnics and luncheons! It looks pretty served over a bed of baby spinach and a few fresh basil leaves on top",

As suggested by other reviewers I used a 16 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and I added two tablespoons of dried oregano plus two tablespoons of dried basil. I used basil and tomato feta cheese. It turned out amazing! Don't forget to add a touch of salt. If you enjoy Feta cheese and Balsamic Vinegar then you will love this tricky concoction. Very unique recipe.",
