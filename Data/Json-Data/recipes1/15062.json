I cut the frozen puff pastry into small rectangles or squares, brushed the pastry with beaten egg, and filled with approximately a teaspoon of brie, a approx. teaspoon of seedless raspberry jam, and a sprinkling of crushed walnuts. I folded each little piece of pastry over on itself to make either a triangle or a square/rectangle shape, poked a hole in the top with a fork and brushed the top with egg. They make delicious breakfast/tea party pastries. \n\nAlso, I tried the same thing with black cherry preserves and it was wonderful! The artisan puff pastry from Trader Joe's came out light and crisp and perfectly browned in a 400 degree oven.",
