Before adding my blueberries, I coated them in a small amount of flour to keep their shape when adding to the batter.  I hand stirred in the berries.  My batter was very thick!  This bread rises high due to the amount of baking powder used, so make sure your oven racks are spaced apart well.  I made 3 mini loaf pans and baked for 25-35 minutes.  Very moist and flavorful!!! Will make again.",

The crust got really crunchy (which I liked) but I ended up baking it for nearly 90 minutes before it was done.",
