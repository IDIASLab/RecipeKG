Has that wonderful balsamic flavor but a creamy raspberry flavor as well.",

It turned out great though and went fabulously with the blueberries and carmelized pecans in my salad. I used raspberry yogurt instead of plain yogurt raspberries. Since it was already sweetened I left out the sugar. I used white vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar that was suggested and a bit of aged balsamic. I know it sounds strange but it was delicious! Mixed it up with a spoon not the blender.",
