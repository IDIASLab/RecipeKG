I did not have any celery so I did celery flakes instead of celery salt. I did not have poultry seasoning so I did 1/4 tsp. sage and 1/8 tsp. paprika. I did only a dash of white wine vinegar instead of the full amount of white wine. Unfortunately I forgot to add the mustard but I'm sure it would have been good. I upped the carrots to around 1/2 cup and used veggie broth instead of chicken. Then I added a drained (14.5 oz) can of corn and a 14.5 oz can of creamed corn... so it came out a little like a corn chowder but you could think of it as potato salad and corn on the cob! Next time I would add quite a bit of black pepper but this was easy and good.",
