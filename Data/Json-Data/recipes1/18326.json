I used Trader Joe's taco seasoning and handmade tortillas. I only had jalepenos in a jar and a few slices of those worked fine in the salsa. I would definitely make this again just because the taco seasoning was such a quick and easy way to season beef. I also just cooked the strips completely in the pan instead of only browning them to save time. Other sauces salsas or toppings could easily be used also. TY",
