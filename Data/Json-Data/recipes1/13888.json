There is a misunderstanding between gulash and \"gulyas\". Hunarians call their favourite soup guly\u00e1s-leves, and most of the foriners mix it up (and sadly we do not corredt them!) with an other meal called \"p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt\" or \"paprik\u00e1s\" what is a stew.\nTo mix you up guys even more, the interesting thing is, they are mostly the same, just the soup version has more stuff in it, like potatoes, carrots, celery leafs and celeriac, and more water! :) Or beans, if it is a (bean)-babguly\u00e1s!\nWhat you all call gulash is not the real thing, if we talk about a hungarian meal!\nI will put on this site the real \"gulash\" what is made of beef, pork or chicken and called \"p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt\".\nIt is a hard name, this is why everybody says gulash! :)\nOh, and I never ever ever have seen any kind of lemon or lemon zest in hungarian soup or stew!!!!! This is sure! Also we do not use butter for cooking meat, just fat or oil.\nCheers,\nAndika",

I traveled to many regions of Hungary for 2 years and found several different varieties -- even one that could only be described as \"vegetarian\" gulyas. The most common version of gulyas however is a simple meat and potato soup that often has a few noodles added for extra measure. Many restaurants in Hungary will spice it up with very hot peppers which is what I did with this recipe.",

Being a Hungarian myself I give it a 3 stars only for the canned ingredients. Hungarians NEVER cook from canned vegetables. At least it is very rare. Who I know they don't. The only not fresh veggie I used is pea but the kind of in the glass jar. Believe me there is a difference. The recipe sounds good otherwise but please use fresh ingredients!!
