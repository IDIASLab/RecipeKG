I added a bit less OJ (1/4 cup less, be sure to use fresh squeezed), half the sugar and I use brown not white, and added half a clove of crushed garlic to give it a kick. Added  some salt and a bit more Dijon (1TBS) as well. I also used mandarin oranges in a pinch they will work as well. Sometimes I use pecans and chevre cheese in place of walnuts and gorgonzola. Both are excellent. Heaven.",

I was looking for an arugula salad recipe that tasted like a salad I had at a local restaurant. With a few substitutes in toppings this salad was very similar in flavor but a lot less expensive than the restaurant version. I like to sometimes use sliced fresh pears instead of oranges omit the onions use glazed pecans instead of walnuts and use goat cheese instead of the Gorgonzola. However I use the dressing as is.
