I made it as directed and it was inedible so I added more preserves. This was a big improvement but in the end I used the sauce to deglaze the skillet (oven-safe so I baked the meat in the same skillet I seared it in) and made gravy out of the juices and preserves which was very good since the spices from the rub were in the pan too. It was NOT as pretty as the original sauce however. This is a make-again recipe for us but since I will never eat the sauce just as written I can't give it a perfect score right off the bat.",
