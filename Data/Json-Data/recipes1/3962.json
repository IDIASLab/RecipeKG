I also use more ground beef, 1#, I buy the cubed hash browned potatoes in the freezer section, along with the frozen diced onions. I use whole milk, and make this recipe as stated. I shave lots of time from assemblage with the 'easy' ingredients. Very hearty, creamy, filling on a cold winter's night. My family loves this, we have been making it for about 5 years now, I was surprised to find it on this site. To thicken this use potato flakes, it works great! The potato flakes make it a richer, thicker soup with substance. ",

But after changes were made it was a pretty good cold day soup.  I did not use the celery or carrots, that is not on a cheeseburger.  I used beef broth instead of chicken broth and the second time I made it I used velvetta instead of cheddar.  Cheddar does not get that creamy when melted.  I am going to try a pasta in it next time instead of the potatoes.  All in all, good basis for a very filling soup.",

I also used frozen cubed hashbrown potatos only because thats what I had.  To the person who said they didn't add the celery & carrots because thats not in a cheeseburger, no wonder you gave it only 3 stars.  This is soup, not a cheeseburger and virtually every good soup starts with onions, celery & carrots (and garlic in my opinion).  I served this to a group of 6 guys during a fishing trip and it got 12 enthusiastic thumbs up.",

After a few minutes I put the hamburger, vegetables and chicken stock in the crock and let cook all day. Then about 1/2 hour before we ate I put the cheese, milk and sour cream in the crockpot and let melt/cook. Wonderful!",

Cook until soft and add 1/8 c flour.  3. Cook for a minute or so and slowly add 1 can (12 oz) evaporated milk.  Then add 1 can (14.5 oz) reduced sodium beef broth.  4. Add 2 teaspoons dried basil, 1 tsp dried parsley, salt and pepper to taste.  5. Used 2 cups frozen Potatoes O'Brien from OreIdea.  6. Grated a 8 oz block of sharp cheddar cheese - the pre-shredded stuff won't melt as well!! and used 1/8 c light sour cream.  7.  Topped with chopped fresh basil, a dollop of sour cream, chopped bacon, AND CHOPPED DILL PICKLES!!!  The dill pickles 100% made the soup for me.  I would never make the soup without them again.  8. Added Tabasco CHIPOTLE Pepper Sauce to taste - FANTASTIC flavor added.",
