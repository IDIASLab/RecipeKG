The only changes I made to this were to add sausage at the beginning before the garlic and to increase the anchovy fillets to three (yes, 3, try it, dare you to!).  Thanks Chef John! Amazing!",

My anchovy did not fully break apart so I would recommend mashing it some before adding it to the soup.  I would also recommend that you reduce the stock until you like the flavor as this will be the main part of the soup.  Not all stock has the same intensity.  My only real change is that I used spinach instead of escarole.  This soup came out great and I would make again.",

After removing the bacon from the pan I removed the fatty parts and chopped the lean pieces to add later. I sauteed 1 yellow onion 1 tsp curry powder and the garlic in the fat. Once the onions were caramelized I added Trader Joe's low sodium vegetable stock seasonings and liquid smoke. After reducing per your recipe I added the beans a can of Glory seasoned collard greens I had on hand and some leftover (cooked) turkey meatballs. The chopped bacon went into the pot in the final few minutes. Yum! Talk about amazing flavor and pretty healthy to boot.",
