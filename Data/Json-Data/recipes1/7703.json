The parchment at the bottom of the tube pan worked perfectly. I can't believe I didn't think of this before! I added a little orange extract to the orange juice. After the cake cooled I cut it in half pulled off the top half carefully scooped out a moat into the bottom half and filled it with lemon curd (easy to make easier to buy). Then I fairly neatly replaced the scooped out mounds. Next I frosted the inside with a \"7-minute icing \" replaced the top half iced all over and coated it in sweeetened shredded coconut. I put toothpicks in it and covered it with plastic wrap (the toothpicks to prevent the wrap from messing up the frosting). I refrigerated the cake until the next day and pulled it out about an hour before dessert time. Easy to cut and serve. Looks marvelous in its coconut glory!",
