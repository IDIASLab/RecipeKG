My husband (ever the eater) did not finish his plate at dinner that night or for leftovers at lunch the next day. My sister also said she would eat it but would not make it request it or really even be happy about it being cooked. My opinion the balance between pasta and veggies is good. This way you can each more than you should without feeling too bad since it is about half veggies. But there is something that is just not right about the flavor. Oh yeah it is really filling...which is good. Good to try once....but not to repeat.",

It does make a lot though so I put the leftovers in hot sterilized jars and put them in the oven at 275 for 20 minutes with lose fitting lids. once out of the oven you can tighten the lids (carefully). Once the lid seals you've got extra canned sauce for future use. It works really well and you'll get to enjoy this yummy sauce again and again without the added effort of making it. =)",
