Should I have cooked the corned beef hash before spreading it across the spinach leaves? Or from some prior life experience should I have known the answer to that question before I even searched Google for recipes? But really why would I have cooked the corned beef hash? The recipe a set of INSTRUCTIONS the steps of which when followed correctly create a predictable outcome said nothing about cooking the corned beef hash. Clearly if the corned beef hash was supposed to be cooked the recipe would have so indicated. If the corned beef hash was supposed to be cooked and that step was omitted from the recipe then it's not a recipe. It's a notional collection of shared experiences. And why after cooking 20 ounces of coconut milk at 350 for almost an hour would it become anything other than 20 ounces of HOT coconut milk? How does that turn into a sauce? Shouldn't there be something that thickens the 20 ounces of hot coconut milk? I followed the recipe and ended up with a pan of hot spinach water. It took three flushes of the toilet to make it all go away.",
