I tried making the frosting twice throwing out the first attempt because it looked awful very lumpy and the butter was leaking out. The second time I figured something must be off in the recipe. All it took was a splash of milk for the frosting to smooth out and it turned out perfectly. Overall the cake is wonderful. The taste is much subtler than what I was expecting and isn't too sweet. The frosting really gives it the candy taste. I made cupcakes out of this recipe cooking them for 20 minutes and they turned out beautifully! Yielded 4 dozen cupcakes and they were gone in a flash. Will definitely make again.",
