She takes an afternoon to make them: to keep dough from drying out during the rolling process first form all the dough balls and pat them down into thick circles with your hands set them next to one another on the counter and cover with a damp dish towel. She cooks the rolled out tortillas on a flat cast iron circular plate that I think she popped out of the top of an old cast iron stove. She just places the circle on top of a burner and then cooks the tortillas on top of that. I bought a cast iron skillet since it seems that the cast iron is important.",

Tip for those with dry tortillas: remember the older your flour and cornmeal get, the more liquid they will need to get the right consistency for the dough.  Freshly ground flour/cornmeal will need less liquid.  If 1 cup of water produced a dry tough dough, next batch try using an extra tablespoon of water and see if your results are better.  Good luck, thanks to the original poster for this recipe!",

Very good reminded me of a tamale. Very easy to make. Those that have had problems with them you need to keep the dough moist and knead it very well. After rolling the balls of dough I covered with a very hot moist towel while they sat 15 min. Rolled out easier than pie crust (be sure you use very little flour to roll them). When I browned them I once again covered with a moist hot towel. Everyone liked them especially with a fruit jam spread on them.",
