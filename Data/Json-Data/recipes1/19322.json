Today I decided to try and lighten them up and used neufchatel cheese (the American version, not French, there's a big difference) and subbed half of that with cottage cheese, which also increases the protein content.  To reduce the possibility of my kids whining about chunks of cottage cheese in it, I food processed the cottage cheese, though I'm not sure that is even necessary if you use small curd. I just didn't want to take a chance.  I could tell no difference with these modifications.  They were just as good, maybe even better.  I think they are a little heavy and dense with all cream cheese and they seemed \"fluffier\" this way.",

We have a lot of venison breakfast sausage and it was really good in this recipe you'd never know it was deer meat!
