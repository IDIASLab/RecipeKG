But then....I feed it to my three sons (5 3 & 2) and I have rarely seen them eat so much or say how much they love love love dinner. So I had to change it to a 5 star after that success! It is hard to say what different people will think about this recipe because BBQ sauces vary so much in taste. We used a honey BBQ which would give an extremely different taste than a spicy sauce. I think this would also taste good with everything but the BBQ sauce if you are unsure about it.",

Added 1 teaspoon of taco seasoning mix and did not mix my cheddar cheese into the meat to melt. I only used a handful of corn (kids not fond of) and used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of canned cause that is what I had on hand. I put my chips in a 350 for 5-7 minutes to heat \"before\" placing meat mixture on them. Will definitely make again so I get to try them!",
