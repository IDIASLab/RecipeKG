The oil that cooks out of the sausage should keep the bread part of the mixture soft and moist and make it flavorful. You can always use 'hot' or 'sage' sausage to add more spice if the 'mild' is too blah... or add a dash of cayenne pepper to the mix. Cooking time may need to be reduced... just watch for golden brown cheese balls.",

I use the sage sausage or special seasoning sausage to give it more flavor. My suggestion for those saying that they are dry is that you must be overcooking them. No one has ever complained about them being dry before. If you really want to kick the recipe up a notch make a batch of \"hot\" ones using the hot sausage and then a batch of mild using the sage. I like that this recipe can be made in advance and then cooked at the last minute. It makes planning a party much easier.",

I added a little powdered garlic and paprika just to see how it would be -- SO GOOD! I think next time I'll use sage sausage. Anyway thanks for the recipe!",
