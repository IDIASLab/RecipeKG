Once they were done I rinsed them in water and dried them very well.  When I inserted them into the ring I tried to put them in as deep as possible.  Hopefully this helps!\n\nOriginal Review: Beautiful bread!  I had to add a little more flour when kneading and shortened the baking time!  Perfect!!  I made one yesterday for Easter, but my family ate it up so I had to bake another today and it came out even better.  Put on sprinkles  for added color.",

I used eggs straight from the fridge and they were not noticibly warm after the loaf rose.  However, the finished loaf should probably be refrigerated for storage if you plan on eating the eggs.  \r\n",
