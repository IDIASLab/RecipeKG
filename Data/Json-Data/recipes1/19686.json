I'm an experienced cook so after checking out the leanness of athe bison sirloin steak I knew to slice it thin and flash fry it and quickly get it off the heat. To no avail the bison was tough and chewy. The rest of the recipe was tasty and fine. I feel that maybe a different cut may be the answer or possibly marinating the meat in a liquid acid marinade might help. I do thank the Bison Council for the opportunity to explore and promote the healthiness of eating the \"other red meat\".",

Since it has very little fat and the bison has even less fat than beef it can get dry quickly. I did not use the frozen green beans as I had fresh on hand. This was a pretty good recipe but I needed to use more red curry paste to get the zip in our curry that we like.",

I added another tablespoon of red curry paste and that didn't help so added a tablespoon of oyster sauce because I didn't want it to taste fishy had I added more fish sauce since it is a beef recipe...while that added a bit of flavor it still wasn't what I thought it should be. It did look good but it wasn't a good flavor. First it was too sweet so I would eliminate the brown sugar. Second it had no salt so would add that to taste. In the end I wouldn't make this again...sorry Bison Council. I threw the leftovers away.",
