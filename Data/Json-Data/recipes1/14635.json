I would suggest doubling the recipe if you want a thicker slice of fudge. This one only came out about 3/4 inch thick if that. It still tasted great and was VERY easy to make. Also Butter Flavored Pam made it much easier to get out of the pan than trying to peel wax paper off the bottom of the fudge.",
