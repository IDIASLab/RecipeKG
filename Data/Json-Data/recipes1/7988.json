Many cakes have an overly sweet frosting, or tend to leave a sour aftertaste. This cake did neither... it was just a great, pleasing all around dessert. Now I just have to find a lamb mold...",

The best thing seemed to be the frosting which I tinted in pastels, added shredded coconut too and presented on green easter grass.  It looked like a pretty tray of colored eggs.  They were a very big hit.  In addition I added coconut milk as the liquid in the cake mix, but nobody seemed to notice that at all.  They were all stuck on the icing!!  This was a very big hit!",
