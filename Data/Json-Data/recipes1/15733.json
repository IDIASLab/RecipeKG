I've made this a few times now for company and people always ask for the recipe and are excited to learn a new way to cook zucchini, especially for the grill.  I've taken the advice of some other commenters and used part olive oil, part butter, instead of all butter. I cut the zucchini lengthwise into four pieces; placed the zucchini strips on the grill, curved side up where appropriate.  I used a basting brush to coat the top side with the butter/garlic/parsley marinate.  After about 5 minutes I flipped the zucchini strips, basted the other side, and sprinkled with parmesan.  4 or 5 minutes later, they\u2019re ready to come off the grill, looking gorgeous and tasting delicious.  I highly suggest adding this recipe to your grilling repertoire.",

I put about  1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese and 1/4 to 1/3 c of Panko Breadcrumbs.  \n     I used 2 zucchini, sliced off the ends and then sliced them in half lengthwise. I sliced a small portion off the skin side to both level the pieces and also to open up to the meat. I dried the squash with paper towels, and scooped out the center seeds and pithy part, and salted generously (this is a bland veggie and needs the salt even using the Parm.  I scored the skin side, and basted with the butter lightly on both sides. I put it flesh side down on the grill for 4 or 5 minutes, basted and flipped.  Then I filled the cavity  with the remaining butter mixture and filled with the Parmesan/Panko.  I grilled for another 8 minutes.\n     Then I put them on a foil covered cookie sheet and put under the broiler for about 3 or 4 minutes, til the cheese was a beautiful crisp golden brown.\n     We enjoyed this with Filet Mignon, and it was just perfect, not to filling but not needing anything else.\n     In spite of salting as well as I did I will probably add a bit more next time, and there will definitely be a next time! Delightful way to enjoy summer's bounty of Zucchini.",
