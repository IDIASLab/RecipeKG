                "reviewBody": "I tried this pie because my husband loves pecan pies but we have a relatively tight budget so don't purchase pecans often for much of anything except salads. We tend to spend the budget on plenty of produce & any discretionary food budget 's on parmesan & etc. In the past I considered trying peanuts instead of pecans but my husband was dubious so I didn't try that. When I heard of beans in a 'pecan' pie it just cracked me up so much that I decided that my husband had to try a pie this way. My daughter did the actual mixing & baking. She did a fairly good job. My family had mixed reviews on this pie. However before sharing our results I need to admit that we underbaked this pie a tad. Perhaps the texture of the beans might be different if it was baked a little longer. That said as it stands my husband is inclined to think that the beans in themselves are not a problem but that he would like a little crunch. So I'm thinking that substituting some peanuts for some beans would work better. Even peanuts have a significant expense for our particular budget especially when compared with beans. So next time we'll try about 1/3 C of peanuts. Also I think that rather than mashing the beans roughly I'll turn the 2/3rds cut of beans nuts out onto a cutting board & chop them roughly using a chef's knife. Other than that the recipe is alright but my husband likes the pie base of his mother's pie so I'll try the beans & peanuts in that base next time. Thanks 4 the idea.",
