Though I wasn't sure about letting the cookies sit in a tin for a week. So I tried them many ways: straight out of the oven (Good) after being stored two days (Very Good) and stored 4 or 5 days (Excellent). We love the wonderful yet subtle taste of lemon. There is no wonder why this recipe has lasted 100 years. The only drawback was I couldn't find anise oil at the time I was baking so I substituted 1 1/2 tsps. of anise extract. It suited our tastes perfectly.",

Unfortunately I came down with a bad cold and dough had to sit a couple of extra days. I thought it might have an ill effect on the cookies. I rolled out the dough in the morning let it sit out all day baked at night. Truly wonderful. The subtle flavors the texture and the scent in the kitchen was fabulous! This is now a Christmas tradition. BTW I did substitute the extract for the oil. And as the recipes states do not let the cookies brown it looses the nice texture. Bravo!",
