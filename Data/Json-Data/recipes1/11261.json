Serve between sesame seed or whole wheat buns and, if desired, plenty of lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles. I also like to use Hickory flavored wood chips when I BBQ to add additional flavor to the meat. If you use wood chips, soak them in water for about an hour, then spread them over the hot coals just before grilling.",
