Be sure you use a casserole deep enough because it can start out fairly high.  I used olive oil instead of butter to brush the phyllo layers, and added some fresh garlic when I sauted the onions.  Another step saver -- I thawed and drained the frozen spinach, then added it directly to the softened onions/garlic without steaming first.  I can't wait to make this again!",

Also added about 1 scant tsp. nutmeg (the traditional Greek seasoning for this dish). I never use eggs in mine as they make the mixture too wet and the lovely phyllo gets soggy as a consequence. Nothing worse than soggy phyllo! I also only used half the phyllo and 2 10 oz. frozen packs spinach for the same reason. Kept the parm and swiss cheese and that was a really nice touch. I used only half the package of phyllo and baked in a 9 x 13 Pyrex dish until golden. Make sure you roll the edges and butter them (it makes a nice pizza-like crust). I serve this with a large Greek salad and on special occasions get to serve it with the homemade baklava that my next door neighbor Georgia -- who is Greek -- brings by during the holidays. Good times.",
