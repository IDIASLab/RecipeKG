I am so glad to find this recipe since I had misplaced mine which was called \"Fudge Jumble Bars\" - a Pillsbury Bakeoff recipe I have used for years.     Only changes I made was I put the batter into a 10\"x17\" pan - makes a whole lot more squares.  Also, dropped the vanilla to 2 teaspoons instead of 2 tablespoons in each part.  I didn't put pecans in either.    Handy hint - you can cut these while they are still hot if you use a plastic knife.  This works for brownies, too.  It's amazing! Nothing sticks to the plastic.",
