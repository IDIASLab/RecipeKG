The last time (I've made it more than once), I used a little over a pound of mild italian sausage and onions (and ran it through the food processor to get the crumbles smaller) and two 26 oz. jars of sauce.  I'm also a not-interested-in-recovering cheese addict so I used mixed in two cups of shredded cheddar with the spaghetti mixture and another two cups on top.  I think I'll stick to this combination as it was quite tasty.  It made so much I gave the neighbor a cube for her toddler who wasn't feeling the love for spaghetti before tasting this.  As a stay at home mom, I love having this in the fridge for my toddler's (and my) lunch.  It holds shape very well so I can cut it into small cubes and serve it to him cold or warm.",

I used Ragu Robusto brand sauce and still spiced it up with extra garlic powder, italian seasoning, and chili powder.  I always do that to jarred sauce.  Very good - a definate keeper as a basic recipe.",

I used less pasta (about 2/3 of a 16 oz package) and about 32 oz. of my favorite basil and oregano sauce. I also sauteed onions and garlic with the ground beef and added Italian seasoning to the sauce. Some reviewers think that cheddar and spaghetti makes a strange combination but I love it! My mom always uses cheddar cheese in her baked spaghetti. I recommend a cheddar and mozzarella bend. I layered spaghetti cheese and spaghetti. I added the cheese on top during the last few minutes of baking. I served it with grated parmesan and garlic cheese toast. I'm sure I'll make this one again!",

I used mozzarella instead of cheddar and since I couldn't find my baking dish..(left it at the in-laws), I opted for the microwave, which worked great.  Plus, it cut down on the cooking time.  I had this done in about 15 minutes.  Oh yeah, instead of ground meat, I used meatballs.  I did alter it quite a bit, but the end result was good and my babies had dirty mouths & full tummies which is all that mattered!!  Thanks Wendy.",
