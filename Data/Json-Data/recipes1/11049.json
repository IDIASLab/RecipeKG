Note that if you don't peel the apple the peel 'bleeds' on itself after a day or two and doesn't look very pretty. The 2nd time I made this I used pineapple chunks instead of crushed. I think I prefer the chunks! Note that one bunch of chopped green onions goes better with this dish than regular onions (in my opinion) and it also adds some color. I didn't find salt and pepper necessary by the way. Thanks for the recipe!",
