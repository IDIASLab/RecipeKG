I've tried over seven other recipes and was disappointment on the brink of giving up I stumbled across this one. I'm happy I didn't quit. Reduce sugar like other reviewers suggested. I used 3 tablespoons. It's not so sweet. Trust me it makes the dough yummy as heck! Also add 6 table spoons of butterflavored shortening to the flour mix. Cut it up in small parts until it is crumbly. Oh boy you won't be disappointed. The dough isn't dry and if you have a large family like mines you will be making these for after school snacks or even lunch for a few days! Thanks for sharing such an amazing recipe. Add full sugar if you are filling these with sweets. It's a must try.",
