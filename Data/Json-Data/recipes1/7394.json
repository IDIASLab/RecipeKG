Thats exactly what is is and what it tastes like! It was really strong rice with bland chicken. I decided to make this because it seemed a lot healthier than other chicken and rice dishes but I was so disappointed. To make matters worse I had a friend over to eat that night and when I offered to put frozen pizza in for her instead she accepted!",

As you read the reviews you will see where other people have thrown their own versions into this to make it their own which is basically what I did the first time I made this. I can tell you which spice is in all my dishes but I vary the amounts based on what taste I am looking for. My advice is to always start with very little spice and then gradually add each one to reach your preference. What's good to me may taste horrible to someone else. So play with it Use Creme of Mushroom instead of Creme of Chicken try adding a little Garlic things like that. You'll find this is a very easy and quick recipe.",

Great with dilled peas and buttered soft French bread!! Along with the water - I used one can of Amy s Organic Cream of Mushroom soup 1 heaping tablespoon of Sylvia s Lemon Pepper seasoning a heaping tsp of cumin fresh (not dried) thyme tsp salt tsp dried lemon peel and the juice of small lemon (last three my additions). The beauty in a recipe that most of the ingredients are to taste means that if it is bland then it is the fault of the cook NOT of the recipe s author!!! The only suggestion I have for the author is to have listed salt to taste because a lot of new cooks wouldn t know to do that to taste - even if it s not listed. I mixed the above with my already cooked/diced chicken and just-cooked jasmine rice. I cooked for a shorter time since my chicken was cooked already. This was absolutely delicious and I will fix it again and again!!! Thanks a bunch Uncle Josh!!!",
