I made some alterations not because I thought it needed it just because I didn't have everything on hand. Instead of making a bouquet garni I just added 1t of thyme and 2 bay leaves along with the parsley. I didn't have any barley on hand so I simply added 1/2 c. of quinoa. SUPER good. Next time I won't add as much salt. Thank you for sharing this easy recipe! Even my kids lapped it up!: )",
