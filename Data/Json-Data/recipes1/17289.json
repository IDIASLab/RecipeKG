I didn't like the way it looked in the glass after I poured the cherry-pineapple over the ice so I poured the whole thing ice and all back in the blender and whirred it more. I thought (before I made it) that I'd need to add more liquid but I was wrong. Already drank it all and I didn't share:)",

The problem with anything with pineapple though is that it's stringy even running through the blender. I included the juice from the can to make it easier to mix and just mixed the heck out of it but there was still a bit of the stringy stuff left. (Since the pineapple is plenty liquidy I may see how well this strains before adding the cherry.) I used frozen cherries so also only used a couple of ice cubes.",
