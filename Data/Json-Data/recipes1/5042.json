I finished the bread off in the oven but even though I greased my bread pan, after 30 minutes, the loaf ended up burning and sticking to the pan and I had to scrape it out with a spatula. I would not make this recipe again, but I might try adding raisins to one of my favorite caraway rye bread recipes. I think it would have the same flavor without the mess.",

Instead of a bread machine, I warmed up the sour milk mixture carefully and put 2 teaspoonfuls of active dry yeast then waited around 20 minutes. (I should've put the sugar in there too. Well, next time...) Then I mixed everything together and let the dough rise overnight. In the morning, I punched it down and put it in a loaf pan to rise again. In the evening, it was ready to be baked for 35 minutes. The next time, I will try 30 minutes. Very delicious recipe! Thank you.",
