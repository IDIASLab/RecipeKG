I followed the recipe as stated and the only complication I had was that I didn\u2019t have enough graham cracker crust for the bottom of my 9x13 pan. I added some extra graham crackers to patch the holes and it worked ok, but the bottom was a bit on the crumbly side. I would suggest increasing the graham cracker crumbs to 1 \u00bd cups and the butter to \u00be cup. The taste made up for the crumbly bar and I will add this one to my recipe collection!",

I did make them a little differently; instead of stirring the graham cracker crumbs and butter together, I poured the melted butter into the bottom of the pan and sprinkled the crumbs on top. I layered the coconut, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and nuts on top and than poured the sweetened condensed milk over everything. I think they are much easier to make this way, and they look and taste great! ",

Found that the recommendation to mix the butter and crackers together didn't create a firm enough base to hold bars together.  Have since found my old recipe which has you sprinkle the graham crackers over the melted butter in the pan, pour half the milk over then add less chips (so over it's not too chocately) add nuts then coconut then pour the balance of condensed milk over the entire mixture.  It seems to come out firmer so you can cut bars that stay together.  However, it was as tasty as ever...",

It's straightforward and all the ingredients come together to compliment each other. I crushed my graham crackers by putting them into a ziploc bag and going over them with a rolling pin. I used a throw away tin to bake these in that I sprayed with a little Pam. I follwed the recipe exactly substituting white chocolate chips for the butterscotch as that's what I had on hand. These were so easy and oh so delectable!",

These tips will help the bars not crumble and make them taste wonderful. Hope this helps. After these alterations, I would give them 5 stars.",

I also had to use about 2 cups of graham cracker crums as it didn't spread over the entire pan.
