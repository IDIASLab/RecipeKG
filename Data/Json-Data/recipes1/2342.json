When it's done w/that stage & going on to rise I stop it take the dough out & put it into a greased loaf pan & let it rise for about an hour. After rising I put the loaf into a 325-350 degree oven & let it bake until it's done(about med. brown). It comes out perfect & tastes delicious!!!!!",

I added 3 tbsp of wheat gluten 1/2 cup of 12 grain cereal and 1/2 cup of bulgher wheat. (Be careful to maintain the correct moisture balance) I let it rise in the mixing bowl for an hour kneaded it back down and split it into two even loaves. Let it rise in the bread pans for another 40 minutes and then baked at 325 for 35 minutes. This produced about the best whole wheat bread we have ever had. Very flavourful with a definite crunch and great texture.",
