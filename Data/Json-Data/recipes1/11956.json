I always put in a 2 lb. bag of hash browns instead of the 1 lb. that is called for here.  Also I use cream of celery or cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of potato.  Finally I add the crushed corn flakes mixed with a little butter on top to give it a little crispy topping and this is my holiday potato recipe.  The best part is that it can be made ahead of time, like the day before (keep refrigerated), which is a big plus at holidays.  Just don't put the crushed corn flakes/butter on top until ready to bake.",

It was great with a few modifications: I peeled my own potatoes instead of using frozen has browns (about 9) and boiled them on the stove in water for about 30-45 minutes.  Once they were cooked and drained, I mixed all of the ingredients together and substituted a can of cream of mushroom for cream of potato.  I also added bacon bits and salt and pepper to the mixture.  I only had to bake them for about 20-25 minutes since the potatoes had been boiled.  Really delish!\n\nHope this helps!",

I think I would use twice or half as much more potatoes next time. Also I found the butter to be unneccessary; the grease from the cheese and the water from the potatoes seemed to provide plenty of liquid. I left off the potato chips and topped it with more cheese which I allowed to melt and form a crust. I think you could make a \"lower fat\" version of this if you used low fat soup cheese and sour cream etc... All in all a good recipe.",
