However the second time I used a cake mix that called for three eggs so I added a forth as the recipe said. (add an extra egg!) Don't do that. Three eggs is enough the forth makes it just too heavy. It was still good but comparing it to the first cake it was not as good. For best results use the strawberry cream cheese, there is something about it that just makes a difference. I used the regular cream cheese the second time and just added a tablespoon of strawberry preserves and it tasted very good but was not as good as when I used the strawberry cream cheese. As for the icing I did the icing that was suggested the first time and it was good but all the things the other reviewers said I found to be true. Just realize that it will be a little difficult to work with. The second cake I used the icing recipe that I found on here several years ago and it has been my stand by since. 1 cup of whipping cream whipped with 1 box of instant pudding(I use cream cheese flavor) and then fold it into a 8 oz tub of cool whip. It is nice and stiff and tastes great. It compliments this cake well.",

                "reviewBody": "This cake is my husbands new favorite cake!  I've made it several times already. Several reviewers mentioned that the strawberry flavor was not strong enough. I've found that this is easily remedied by using strawberry cream cheese in the cake and making it a day in advance and storing in the fridge. The flavor is much stronger (and tastier) the next day.  Also an easy way to make sure you have no clumps in your frosting; let the cream cheese come to room temperature, dice up into cubes and put in a blender, finely chop the white chocolate and once the cream is warmed melt the chocolate in it then pour the warm chocolate/cream mixture over cream cheese, cover and blend until smooth. I've made the frosting with both cool whip and fresh whipping cream it is much better with heavy whipping cream. This is my go to recipe whenever we have company for dinner.***update*** I just made this with raspberries instead of strawberries and it was AMAZING! I just used raspberry cream cheese and sweetened pureed raspberries that i put through a siv(sp?) to get out all the seeds.*** The possibilities are endless, made it again with pineapple cream cheese and pureed canned pineapple and hubby loved it! Maybe even more than the strawberry***",

I also used strawberry cream cheese in the cake, and unsweetened strawberries (measured before I pureed them) with 2.5 T sugar added.  Everything mixed up fine in my mixer after a few minutes.  The cake baked in about 32 minutes, and was moist but not soggy.  The frosting was also delicious- make sure the cream cheese is at room temp. and the whipped topping is thawed for it to mix well.  If assembling a layer cake, the frosting would definitely need to be refrigerated in order to hold, as well as after the cake is made or it will fall apart.  Otherwise, this was easy and just delicious!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great cake but lousy instructions. The reason everyone is having such a difficult time with frosting is the whipping cream should be chilled after you melt the chocolate in it. Then when cold it should be beaten until stiff peaks form. Then beat in the cream cheese. Stir in the cool whip last.I only used half of a 8 oz tub. Was plenty of frosting. The second problem withe recipe was mixing the cake. The order is all wrong! Beat the cream cheese first until smooth then add eggs one at a time (do not add but 3 eggs)Then add the cake mix. Batter will be thick. The third problem is bake time. It is more like 30-35 minutes. That is why some are having problems with it being wet and soggy. Other than poor directions this cake is awesome! Done right that frosting is great!",

If you're having trouble deciding on a recipe definately try this one first! It is a very moist creamy cake. The only thing I changed was the frosting because I wanted something simple.

I found that if I stored the cake in the fridge the frosting got very grainy. If the frosting was room-temp it was perfectly smooth and creamy.

They didn't really have a strong strawberry flavor I even used strawberry cream cheese as suggested by other reviewers. The recipe itself was pretty simple so I'll probably stick with this one only modify it a bit since this was only the test run. Next time I'll add a couple teaspoons of strawberry extract. Also because of the bad reviews I didn't even try the icing. Instead I used the one suggested by Grandma Lizzy. 1 cup whipping cream mixed with 1 box instant pudding (she suggested cream cheese flavor but I used white chocolate) then fold into 8 oz. cool whip. It was exactly what I was looking for light like whipped cream yet stiff enough to use as cupcake incing.",
