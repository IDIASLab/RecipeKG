I mean, if eating uncooked hotdogs is your thing then it won't matter, but I'm definitely a cook first kind of person as is the rest of my family.  :) I also cut the dogs in either HALF or thirds.  If I have those link little appetizer sausages, I use those since they taste THE BEST!  Cheese is definitely optional and if I do use it.. shredded is what I have on hand, and I pinch the ends so it doesn't come out.  Most crescent tubes say cook at 350 if using a dark pan (cookie sheet), but I tend to cook mine at 325 (my oven cooks fast and from trial and error... I've realized this works). ...so it thoroughly cooks because my oven tends to cook crescents fast and I like it to be all golden ...not \"brown\" on the bottom and uncooked on top.  I cook it 3/4 of the way then flip if they're golden on the bottom ...just until the other side is golden.  Who wants burnt bottoms?! If they feel gooey.. you basically just cook for 2 more min until it's done (for those wondering how long)  :) PERFECTION!",
