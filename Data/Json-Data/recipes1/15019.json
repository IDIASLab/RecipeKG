I followed the recipe exactly except I used provolone in place of cheddar (personal preference). I'm thinking swiss might be good to try too. As a cute little appetizer you could also slice up a bagette and make \"mini\" sandwiches with this recipe. Very versatile recipe and absolutely delicious! I will definitely be making again.
