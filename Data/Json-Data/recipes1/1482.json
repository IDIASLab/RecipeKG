I would consider it a fruitcake; people who are not sure they like fruitcake love this. I leave the apple on 5-10 days making sure it's sitting in a nice cool place it just makes it moister and tastier........Here it is December 2011 and I must add to my review. This cake is so good I have people that get me to bake it for them for Christmas each year. I have already baked 2 in November and I have 3 more to bake. It's like Lay's potato chips you can't take just one bite.",
