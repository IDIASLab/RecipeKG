Once pureed I knew I'd get it past their lips! I did leave the crushed tomato bits in though. I also added 1/2 tsp. dried basil for a touch of color. I used half & half and ended up using almost 3 cups. Delish! Diane:-)",

When I made this last week by fiance adored it and said it was the best vodka sauce he ever had... while on the other hand I couldn't even eat one serving of it because all I could taste was bacon which was gross. I guess that if you love bacon this is a good recipe because my fiance made me promise not to get rid of the recipe so that I could make it down the road again for him. I DID add some parmesan cheese to the sauce... because it really needed a little something extra.",

Although I didn't follow the recipe EXACTLY I would never have thought of making it like this otherwise. I used Center cut bacons (b/c that's what I had in hand but I realize using regular bacon may be too strong of a flavor and you cut a lot of fat by using Center cut). I also only use San Marzano Tomato Sauce or Peeled Tomatoes because they are less salty and every chef I know recommends them. I also did not use fresh tomatoes because I just happened to miss that part but it was great nonetheless. As for heavy cream I never measure the full amount because it's usually too heavy for me so I just eyeball it for color and my preference in flavor for the heavy cream. Thank you so much for the recipe I will never have to look up another Penne a la Vodka sauce recipe again!!",
