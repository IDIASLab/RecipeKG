Firm tomatoes made scooping out the middles easy and the cilanto substitution was quite good. Additionally I added Goat Cheese and Pine Nuts tented with foil except for last 3 minutes to brown nuts and slightly melt cheese and left the \"caps\" off. Yummy nutty flavor with the mildness of the cheese made this an elegant side dish for the fish I served it with! Would be a good main dish but Hubby generally likes more than veggies for supper.:)",
