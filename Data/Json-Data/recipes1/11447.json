For each packet I sliced some regular carrots in place of the baby carrots and added some sliced fresh mushrooms. Also drizzled a good amount of olive oil over the top of the vegetables before sealing the packets. I scaled the recipe to 3 servings which reduced the ground beef to 1 pound. To the ground beef I mixed in 2 tsps Worcestershire sauce 1/2 tsp garlic powder 1/2 tsp onion powder 1/2 tsp salt 1/4 tsp black pepper 1-1/2 tsps Italian seasoning and 2 tbsp of roasted garlic ketchup. Thanks Michelle. This is a great recipe when you want a good dinner without a lot of dishes to clean up.",

I did add a couple of things- to the hamburger I mixed in some worcestershire sauce season all and an egg. I also put a pad of butter on top after placing the veggies in. It has definitely become my family's favorite meal! 5 stars!!",
