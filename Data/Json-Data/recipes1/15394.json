Realize that EVERYTHING in this salad plays its part -- the smokiness of the chicken, the sweet grape juice-bombs, and the crunchiness of the almonds and celery, to name a few.  I could not find smoked chicken, so I threw four half-chicken breasts, two teaspoons of hickory liquid smoke (spice or bbq sauce aisle), some olive oil, and fresh ground pepper in a ziploc bag overnight, rubbing and turning once or twice, and then simply baked them in the morning (don't overcook!).  Also, added things to the bowl in a certain way (not sure how much it mattered, but I didn't want the grapes crushed):  chicken, onion, celery, then almonds.  Then I lightly salted and peppered, tossing.  Then the grapes, mayo and basil, gently.  Tripled the batch, brought it to an Easter picnic, and people RAVED.  My only tip?  Increase the chicken by about half, and make it all the night before -- I'm sure the flavors will blend even better after some hours in the fridge.\r\n\r\nKristine, will you marry me? :)  Thank you for this recipe!",

Next time I'll grill or poach chicken myself and probably use a little more than 6 oz.  This is definitely a keeper recipe!",

In the past I have made a similar one that called for tarragon tarragon vinegar and just plain cooked turkey but this one is better. I think it is because of the smoked meat (I used Jennie-O sun-dried tomato Hickory Smoked Turkey Breast). Since I had 1-1/2 cups of grapes I increased the turkey to 7 oz. and the onion to 3/4 cup. Cut the mayo to 1/2 cup of low-fat and mixed 1 Tbs. of dried basil (didn't have any fresh) into it before I added it to the salad. Next time I would use either coarsely chopped almonds or pecans because the slivered almonds got lost somewhere. The salad was a little dry so I added a sprinkle of chicken broth to wet it up. VERY VERY VERY GOOD. Do try this salad.",

What came to mind is the next time I think I'll tear the lettuces (or buy the prepackaged \"three lettuce\"bag)...into a bowl and swish a bit of sweet sesame dressing (like the kind you'd use for spinach salad) on it. Not alot just a little to give the lettuce just a twinge of sweet taste to compliment the salad. I too used smoked turkey from the deli. Worked great.",
