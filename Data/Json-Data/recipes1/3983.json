The oatmeal crust was brick-hard and the chocolate kept separating from the crust when I was trying to chisel it out of the pan. On the 2nd attempt I made several changes: I halved the recipe and put it in an 8x8 pan. I turned the oven down to 350 and only baked the oatmeal crust for 5 minutes. I also used 3 parts chocolate chips and 1 part butterscotch chips because I thought it was too sweet with the 50/50 mix. Lastly I used Crisco to grease the pan instead of baking spray. The 2nd batch was much improved over the first!",
