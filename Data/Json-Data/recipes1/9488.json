I did saute some fresh garlic sliced onions a sliced red pepper and fresh mushrooms (instead of canned) before adding the rest of the ingredients. I sprinkled each helping with parmesan cheese. Sick as I am this was the best thing I'd had in days. I don't think I'd use canned asparagus next time I'd use fresh. I think I'd add a little italian seasoning next time too. Great starter recipe with pantry items for a quick dinner.",
