I marinated for 10 hrs in the fridge, then cooked on LOW in a crock pot/slow cooker for alsmot 12 hours. Then added the bbq sauce mixture (made a double batch so it was sloppy & juicy-hubby likes it that way!)& put it back in the slow cooker for another 1 or 2 hours. Served on soft rolls. I will make this again & again. (to serve 35 people I made 3 9 pd briskets) along with a bunch of other sides. THANK YOU!!!",

After adding the BBQ sauce and cooking for another hour, the meat was more like pulled pork, which tasted ordinary--even my picky 5 year old daughter preferred it w/o the sauce!. Note: I rubbed in 2 1/2 Tbsp of Wright's liquid smoke into the meat; my dry rub was 2 1/2 teasp Kosher salt, 1/2 teasp freshly ground pepper, 2 teasp onion POWDER, and 1 1/2 teasp garlic POWDER--combined in a small bowl then rubbed into the meat. I will use this recipe again for sandwiches, or any other use requiring cooked meat--really tasty!!",

We've used this recipe several times and have two ways of finishing the brisket. If my husband is home (he's the grill-man) I use less liquid smoke and have him throw the brisket on the grill with either hickory or mesquite chunks during the last 1/3 of the cooking time. This gives the meat a nice brown grilled texture and flavor and adds a bit of smoke flavor to the meat. If he's not home I double the liquid smoke and remove the foil during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking after slicing and adding sauce to caramelize the sauce a bit...makes it richer on top of the meat. We always double or triple the sauce and serve the extra on the side. I find that the sauce has better flavor if made the day before the brisket and left to sit in the refrigerator overnight...lets the flavors mingle.",
