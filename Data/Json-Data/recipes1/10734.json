Here's what I did based on other reviews: used 1 tsp minced garlic with the butter, only used about 1 1/3 cups milk and 4 oz. of parmesean (half a container of kraft grated), about 1/4 tsp black pepper and a few grinds of sea salt.  This was the best alfredo I have ever had!!!  I didn't even taste a hint of cream cheese and the sauce turned out smooth and creamy and cheesy!!  I served it with cut up grilled chicken and fettucine.  I LOVED it and so did my boyfriend!! I had some extra sauce so I took it to my friend and she thought it was super delicious!! This will be the only alfredo I make from now on! I hate the jar stuff!  The best advice I can give is to have some patience and the whisk IS A MUST!!  Put the milk in a little at a time and just keep stirring.  Don't use too high of heat and I'm telling you your sauce will turn out perfect!!  Thank you for such a great recipe!",

It is my husband's favorite dish (in fact, I'm pretty sure this is why he married me!) and he requests it constantly.  The only time I had a problem with separating or a heavy butter flavor was the one time I used real butter instead of margarine.  It still tasted very good, but the flavor was MUCH richer and it was significantly thicker overall.  If you have trouble with the parmesan being too grainy or sticking to the bottom of the pot, try adding it right after mixing in the cream cheese and whisk well.  It will be super thick before adding the milk, but the parmesan will blend better.  If you are worried the 2c milk is too much, try mixing everything together and leaving it on low heat while you boil water for the pasta.  It will thicken alot as it cools too.  Other than that, the only real tweaking that I have done is to always ALWAYS add a healthy dash of oregano.  Other seasonings may come and go, but I find oregano essential for rounding out that Italian flavor. **update** Since a few reviews suggested nutmeg I decided to experiment on what I thought was already perfection and it was definitely worth it!  A good dash or two of nutmeg really adds depth and compliments the oregano too. **more update** For those who say they taste too much cream cheese, make sure you are using the whole 6oz of Parmesan. If you are using enough Parmesan it should become the dominant flavor.",

Easy, cheap and comforting, and not super greasy like my other recipe.  I did add a few dashes of nutmeg and parsley, pepper, and more salt to taste once I had tossed it.  Thanks!\n\nBY THE WAY: DON'T rate a recipe if you COMPLETELY change it!!!!

I am generally a traditionalist, but the addition of cream cheese is pure genious. I have never made such a velvety alfredo before.  This is my new standard recipe. I did, however, make the following changes; I used some cream and some milk. I also used more parmesan than called for, and topped it off with some nutmeg and fresh parsley. I have also used this sauce as a base for many other sauces, creamy pesto, garlic and mushroom, creamy basil and tomato, the possibilities are endless.  Thanks very much for a great recipe.",

I did make a few of my own adjustments; I used 1 cup of cream and 1 cup of milk like a few others suggested, I used nutmeg instead of garlic powder and pepper, and used parmesean and romano cheeses. It was so luxurious, and reheats slightly better than some homemade sauces. Great for tossing with pasta or more substantial items like meat and veggies. Definately a keeper!",

                "reviewBody": "We made this for dinner last night.  It was awesome!  My daughter likes it better than my old recipe.  Her boyfriend said it tastes like Olive garden.  I served it with noodles and topped with grilled chicken.  The recipe is easy to make.  The key trcik here is to make the sauce on low heat and add the cheese a little at a time. Do not let it start to boil as the butter will seperate.  We will definitely be using this recipe again.  We made no substitutions but made the recipe exactly as written.  Please help me encourage other Allrecipe reviewers to not rate any recipe lower than 5 stars if they do not follow the recipe exactly.  Why do people make changes to recipes and then rate them 3 stars?  Makes no sense to me.  ",
