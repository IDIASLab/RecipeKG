I cut them into slim French fry size pieces, and they cook up fine in a combo of olive oil and butter.  Takes maybe 12 to 15 minutes. A few will get very dark brown, but this is delicious, and when I make them I try to make sure that some are getting dark brown. Some thyme leaves are a good addition.  This is a superb way to fix parsnips and a good way to start cycling potatoes out of the menu rotation. Great with fish.",

I overcooked them & they were too mushy to crisp up in the frying pan. Yuk! But totally MY fault. I decided to give it another go (after the bad cooking memory faded with the family enough for them to at least TRY them again), this time making sure they were still firm before the fry step. What a difference! Super tasty, carmelized, addictive, and I have redeemed myself from the Great Parsnip Debacle. Now a staple in our regular rotation. Thanks for a great, simple recipe (I somehow managed to mess up) that got us to try a new veggie. (even if it is fried yummy goodness, lol)",

I followed the recipe with the exception of simmering the parsnips for a shorter period of time -- the were tender after about 5 minutes.

They need to be a bit firm as you stick a fork into them after boiling. They will cook just slightly more as you fry them in the butter. They naturally have a sweet taste so we love to add lots of salt. Great sweet salty combo. They get bitter if burnt. Fry to a medium golden brown to bring out the best flavor. Cut them about 1/4\" thick. Round is great but long cuts are easier to fry and flip.",
