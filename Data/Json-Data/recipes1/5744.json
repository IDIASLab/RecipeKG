I had similiar problems with getting the Salmon to keep the flavor and have found that if you wrap it in Aluminum with some of the marinade and cook it you retain much more of that flavor, but you   lose some grilled flavor.  If you cook it almost to done and then remove and place on the grill by itself it gets a good mix of both the grilled flavor and the marinade.",
