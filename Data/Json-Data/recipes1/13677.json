My old review on this used to say \"add 1/2 t baking soda\" because i had forgotten to include it when i 1st submitted this recipe but once again allrecipes finally made the change so this recipe is now perfect as written. so dont change anything!!! However, Sometimes I do crisco instead of butter. but either way its good.\nThis has been my favorite recipe since I was 14. Ive tried other ones, but always go back to this one. My friends all love it too, and they only use this recipe. I always underbake my cookies and then freeze them; that way they never get hard.",

My 24 year old son gave you a 9 1/2 out of ten the first day these were baked and said the remaining 1/2 will be granted when they pass the freshness test in a couple of days.  Well, they did.  The dough is excellent to work with.  I like a dough that I can roll into balls without messy hands.  They stayed high after cooling, were chewy and chokeful of chocolate chips.  I think the problem some had with inconsistency is because the dry ingredients have to be added in gradually as per instructions so that the baking powder will be well-distributed throughout the dough.  After trying tens of recipes this is the one I'll keep.  Thanks, Ashley.",
