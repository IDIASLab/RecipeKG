I was attracted to this recipe bc it seemed simple. I admit that in terms of texture and form the cookie was excellent. HOWEVER it lacked flavour. I found that I had to add at least 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of cloves to give it that kick. I also doubled the amount of brandy and vanilla essence. I also toasted the almonds. It came out authentic-enough ( but it still lacked a bit of kick ). I have grown up and lived in Cyprus and Greece for 10 years so I know that specific \" kick \" that is distinctive of kourambiethes. I will make this recipe again but I will add the cloves and nutmeg spice double up the brandy icing sugar and vanilla essence.",

I rolled out the entire recipe of cookie dough into a log then used a bench scraper to cut the cookies to the desired with. I then shape them into crescents and bake them off for 25 minutes. after Cooling I just did them in powdered sugar and place them individually into cupcake paper cups due to their flaky texture.",
