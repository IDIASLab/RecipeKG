Without exception, everyone liked it - even those picky eaters who wouldn't touch my homemade Cranberry Chutney - and some took home a piece for later.   CONS: The 1 tea. of almond extract would have been overpowering for my taste. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used 1/4 tea. of almond extract and 3/4 tea. of vanilla. That was perfect with enough of an almond taste that other bakers could identify it in the pie.   SUGGESTION: After you pat the mixture in the pan, take a handful or so of cranberries and scatter them on top, pushing them gently about half way into the batter. Some will burst and run while cooking, giving the pie a more festive presentation with more red on top in lieu of a lot of the white batter showing on top.",

I would describe the texture of the \"cake\" as a cross between a cake and a brownie (non-chocolate, of course).  I think the almond flavoring really ties it all together, and the nuts are essential too.  As I usually do, I used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour in place of the white.  My husband was really blown away by this; he wasn't looking forward to \"cranberry pie\" but said it was one of the best things he's ever had!",

Leave everything else the same. I have always used frozen cranberries (not defrosted) and had no problems, but yes, the batter is very thick. It isn't a pie, but a sort of torte made in a pie dish. Don't do the cinnamon or strudel topping thing, it doesn't go with the almond flavor at all, and the almond flavor is the whole point of this dessert, which has the wonderful consistency of a (non-chocolate) brownie. If you like the flavor of marzipan then you will love this dessert. And honestly, can people stop giving negative reviews to recipes they did not even make? If you made this with blueberries and lemon extract and Egg Beaters, then you can't say the recipe is bad! You did not make the recipe!!!",
