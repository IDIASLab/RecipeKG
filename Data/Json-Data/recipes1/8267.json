However upon reading previous review of it being bland before adding cheese sauce I put salt and pepper on the onions and then after I put the cheese sauce and paprika on I sprinkled chives on the top. I will probably make double the cheese sauce next time just to add more substance. Not using as many onions next time (I don't have a food scale so I over guesstimated the 3 lbs of onions) this is a very good side dish!!!",

Next, do one of two things:  either make more sauce or slice fewer onions.  I weighed my onions, and I could tell after boiling them that I was not going to have enough sauce.  I made a little more sauce, but not enough.  Instead of arranging the onions in the dish, and topping with the cheese sauce, I mixed the onions into the sauce.  But not all of them, I simply still had too many onions for the amount of sauce.  We love onions, but don\u2019t make this recipe if you\u2019re not a fan, that makes no sense.  IT. IS. ONIONS, and a lot of them. Also, IMO as a side dish, this recipe will make about 8 servings, not 5.  This was a different  twist on a creamy, cheesy side dish, and although it needs a little tweaking,  we enjoyed it.",
