Also, with the topping I mix the evaporated milk and egg first with a whisk. Then as I'm heating the topping I continue to mix with the whisk. This keeps the egg from cooking, it just takes longer for it to thicken up. Great recipe!",

Well I just had to try to duplicate it so that I didn't have to go clear across town anymore to get it. This did not duplicate it it FAR EXCEEDED it!! This is the yummiest pie and really does taste like German chocolate cake. I loved it. I made it exactly as written and it was perfect. The German chocolate is just a sweet and interesting flavor much better than regular ol' milk chocolate and the topping is divine. It makes more than plenty of it though so I certainly helped myself to a few spoonfuls. Mmmm...delish! The filling is so rich and yummy it really does resemble a mousse. My first pie crust didn't work for me so I had to run to the store to get another and bake it and even though the filling just sat there the whole time it still tasted great! I wholly recommend this recipe for anyone who likes German chocolate cake. This and a cup of coffee would be a match made in heaven. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!",
