My husband requests it regularly to use up our game from winter/fall hunting seasons.  I just toss all the spices in the mix together vs. coating the meat since I quite often JUST make the sauce/glaze.  It can be as tangy or as spicy as you prefer---for kids, you can add ketchup in place of Chili Paste.  It works great with apricot/pineapple preserve as well. Try making it up just for a tangy dipping sauce for a party with meatballs or other appetizers.",

Found in Caribbean section of grocery store here in the northeast.) The result was great although glaze was a little on the thin side. I would probably decrease wine to 1/4 cup next time.",

I have used peach preserves, and I have used jam .. I prefer to use jam (peach, apricot).. I just buy the small jar of jam, and it basically equals 1 cup, so I scrape all of the jam out of the jar and just use that ... I'm not much of a white wine drinker, don't usually have any around unless its the holidays, but Vermouth (used for making martini's .. also comes in a green 'Martini' bottle) can be used in replacement of wine, and it keeps longer in the cupboard... whenever a recipe calls for white wine, I just use vermouth, can't even tell the difference, and its like a herbed wine anyways... I also add a few cloves of minced garlic... I usually make this with white rice, and stir-fry vegetables, and spoon the sauce all over everything (makes alot of sauce).. leftovers are even better!",
