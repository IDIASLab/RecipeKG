Also I flattened each cookie with a fork prior to baking - these cookies won't flatten on their own! Very nice flavor and so easy to make! The only other suggestion I can think of is to possibly cut back on the butter due to the oily-ness of the potato chips though I didn't find that the amount of butter was necessarily a problem. Thanks for the recipe!",

I combined many of the suggestions such as: added 3/4 C packed brown sugar 1 tsp vanilla 1 tsp baking powder and I put in 1 C of crushed potato chips. I didn't have any walnuts so I used pecans. I also flattened them with a glass before baking. My issue is even though they tasted great I really didn't taste any potato chip. I can see the potato chips so I know I didn't crush them too finely. Maybe I will make them as a shortbread cookie and see if I notice a difference then.",
