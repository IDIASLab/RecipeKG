They are a little crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. I increased the flour to 2 cups and changed to 2 eggs and decreased the chocolate chips to 1-1/2 cups. I also found that if you pack every layer as you go, there is too much room left open at the top of the jar. So I only packed it down at the top before adding a final layer of chocolate chips. (I layered it like this: flour, chocolate chips, flour, brown sugar, flour and chocolate chips. Very pretty! Thank you!",

I followed suggestions and made a few add-ons of my own: 2 cups flour 2 eggs and using 1 cup white chips 1 cup semi sweet chips 1/2 cup walnuts 1 big tsp cinnamon and using 2 tsp vanilla. The baking temp is perfect for 8min timing too. All the dry ingredients DID fit with good packing down and the layering looked beautiful! (flour/baking soda mixed 1/2 Bwn. Sugar white sugar 1/2 brn sugar cinnamon ch.chips walnuts white chips) I did refridgerate the dough for about 15 minutes before baking and I think that helped them stay big and puffy without falling flat. These turned out so beautiful and yummy and the cinnamon really added a holiday feeling that was not overwhelming. This will be my \"must use\" mix from now on- thank you for this great recipe!",
