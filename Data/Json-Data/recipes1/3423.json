I also added a generous amount of seasoning salt and pepper.My noodles looked funny,but they were delicious and easy to make! This is the perfect recipe for a cold rainy day! 5 STARS!!!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a good chicken soup recipe although for the time involved I think it should have been better. The time is this recipe's only shortcoming I think. Other than that I would recommend making your own stock (I cooked 2 large chicken breast halves with some celery carrot salt and pepper --simmer for 40 minutes remove chicken simmer 20 mintues more strain. Be sure to skim while simmering. The chicken I then shredded to use in the recipe). Using the resulting stock plus 2 cans of chicken stock and about 2 more cups of water made a nice soup base not too salty or greasy as I feel canned stock alone can sometimes be. I also found that I had to add about 4 more cups of water while the soup was cooking in order to keep the water level up. If you like chewy noodles (not necessarily a bad thing) then go ahead and roll out to the suggested 1/8 inch thick but if you don't like to have to cut your noodles when eating soup then make the noodles paper thin when rolling out. I also added different spices which I think really added flavor--a touch of ground ginger (maybe 1/2 teaspoon) plus 4 teaspoons of Old World Seasoning blend by Penzey's Spices. This in particular was a great addition! Overall try this soup especially if it's a cold dreary day and you have nothing better to do.",
