I also didn't measure or time anything properly, but no matter - this couldn't go wrong unless you have the heat too high. My simplified version: Saute the garlic (and a julienned red pepper) in the oil (just until the pepper slightly loses its brightness). Add the damp spinach and stir to wilt, then add pine nuts, salt and pepper. Cook until you're happy with the consistency by simmering a few minutes longer at med-high to reduce any extra liquid. I sprinkled each serving with a scant tsp of finely grated mild cheese, and this was fabulous. I added the red pepper for a little extra flavour and a bit of visual pop. Definitely a keeper, and most likely a regular dish in our house from now on. Thanks for sharing!!",
