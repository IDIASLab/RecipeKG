I would recommend dicing them instead. I would also recommend not adding the flour to the veggies first. Next time I make this, I'll add the stock (I used stock in place of boullion & water) to the veggies and simmer till tender. Then, stir the flour into the milk and add that to the soup along w/ the cheese. This will allow more time if needed for the veggies to cook w/o affecting the texture, as I noticed the soup was slightly grainy from having to cook it too long. Otherwise, the taste was lovely and my children went back for seconds. :) ETA: I also thought 2/3 cup of flour was alot. It could probably be cut back to 1/3 cup w/ success. :) ",

My tweaks: did as others and sauteed the garlic with onions and celery; I decreased cheese to two cups; used skim milk; added an extra 1/2c. potatoes, probably 1-1/2c. cauliflower.  Could have added some broccoli or more carrots or cauliflower.  My young boys gobbled it right up! Thanks for sharing! Oh, and I didn't add any salt, just 1/2t. pepper.  The salt from the bouillon was enough for us.",
