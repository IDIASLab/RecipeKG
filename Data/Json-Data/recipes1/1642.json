We didn't have any walnuts so I just took it out of the recipe.In the flour mixture, I added one tsp cinnamon which turned out really good. Another thing i changed was I added 3 cups of apples instead of 2. The last thing I did was instead of sprinkling the icing sugar on the cake, I added some water to it to make it into a simple icing and poured it over.It was a bit too sweet so i might bring down the sugar next time. I think this cake would also be better in 3 layers rather than 5 (put the whole apple mixture in the center) because it became a little too mushy where the apples were...though still very good. I might add raisons and walnuts next time I make it too. I also made this cake in a ring shaped pan which looked nice with the icing. This recipe was very good!",

I was very surprised and thankful! The cake really was moist and flavorful. Be careful not to overbake. My edges were a little overdone but the cake was still good. Perfect autumn harvest cake.",

Per several other reviewers, I modified it as follows: 3 cups apples instead of 2; 1 1/2 cups of white sugar + 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 2 cups of white sugar; 1/2 cup oil + 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of 1 cup oil; omitted the walnuts; added 1 tsp of baking soda; and added 1/2 tsp allspice.  I folded the apples into the mixture rather than layering and I baked for only 50 minutes.  I sprinkled with powdered sugar and added the caramel icing (1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup butter, and 2 tsp milk and brought to boil for 2 minutes).  Turned out perfect.  I will sprinkle pan with white sugar next time instead of flour as suggested by another reviewer.  Highly recommend trying this recipe!",
