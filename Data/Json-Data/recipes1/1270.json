She insisted I use her traditional recipe because hers was better. Funny thing, one year I made both and she loved her recipe but my pie was gone in a flash. There is nothing wrong with the recipe. I have made this for years.*****Don't forget the salt. The trick to balance the sweet is more pecans and how you put the pie together. Put a nice layer of chopped pecans on the bottom before filling, some will rise and become candied on the top. Then put a nice layer of chopped on the top and then decorate with whole. I don't use a lot of whole because it makes it messier to cut up and eat.**** If your pie is too high in the oven it will take longer to set up. Ive always used a glass pan. You have to use a ring to protect the crust. I know at higher altitudes Ive had to put foil over the whole pie for an additional 10 minutes to get it to set. I give it a poke with a toothpick and a wiggle if it jiggles it needs more time. Experienced cooks know cooking times can be approximate. Let it cool completely on the counter to set. I always make mine the night before.******* For deep dish pies add 1/4 more sugar and syrup, one more egg and adjust to 1 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt.",

I sprinkled the bottom of the deep dish crust (unbaked) with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Instead of a full cup of light corn syrup I used 1/2 cup of light corn syrup and 1/2 cup of Lyle's Golden Cane Syrup and added 2 tsp. of vanilla. It gave the pie a wonderful caramel taste. I did have to bake about 1 1/2 but I tented the pie with aluminum foil so the top wouldn't burn. It was absolutely what I was looking for and it will be my go-to recipe in the future. Thanks for letting me experiment with your wonderful recipe Laurie.",
