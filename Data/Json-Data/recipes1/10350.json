I definitely agree that 12 oz of pasta requires more than just 6 oz of artichoke hearts so I beefed-up the recipe by adding about 15 sea scallops. Just throw them in as you are cooking the onion and garlic. It turned out GREAT! I'm sure that shrimp would work just as well!!! 25 g protein 14 g fat 9 g dietary fiber 31 mg cholesterol",

By chopping the artichokes as they warmed completely forgetting about the onion and just generally hauling butt I got this on the table in under 20 minutes. Slightly more than getting fast food but a heck of a lot better tasting and better for you. I used hearts in hot marinade and I will probably do it again. I highly recommend this recipe for everyone vegetarians and meat eaters (like me) alike for its delightful mix of flavours ease of preperation and the many possible variations.
