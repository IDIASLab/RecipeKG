I made the soup with only roasted acorn squash and it was very good; I'm sure it would be even better with butternut squash. This recipe is very flexible: I used chicken broth instead of vegetable stock; I didn't have any tart apples so I eliminated them from the recipe; and I used white wine instead of sherry. I also didn't have curry powder and added a different aromatic Indian spice called garam masala. Don't be afraid to add a lot of cayenne or to double the recipe (make sure you have a big pot though). The overall dish is not too spicy or Indian flavored; rather it is warm and creamy with very little fat. The wine or sherry really add flavor. It's an easy recipe if you have a food processor to puree everything. Make a salad while the squash roasts (perhaps with some figs nuts and crumbled cheese) and cut up a hearty loaf of bread. When you serve the squash soup you could even add a dollop of some cheese. I sprinkled on parmesan but a creamier cheese like goat or cream cheese would compliment the texture of the soup.",

It\u2019s a beautiful golden yellow colored dish, with good tummy warming flavor. First note: As written you get a bunch o\u2019 soup, almost a gallon in my case, so, if you build the full recipe keep this in mind. Might be a very good idea to change the serving size to smaller level before you print it all up. Verona\u2019s very specific in her squash types. Personally, I find that as long as the squash types are all yellow, you\u2019ll come out fine. Big note: Please, anytime you cook squash, do it in the oven, just as Verona suggests. If you boil squash you not only pull all the water-soluble vitamins out of it, you pull the sugar. You\u2019ll be amazed to find that if you cook squash properly, it\u2019s so sweet you NEVER add sugar, syrup or whatever. You see \u201cadd sugar\u201d constantly in squash recipes, and honestly, it\u2019s ridiculous. Try roasting it just once, and you\u2019ll almost certainly agree. Oh, great \u201cguy recipe\u201d here, dudes. It\u2019s not only virtually bullet proof but it has a Manly Mess Rating of at least 7 out of 10.",

I brushed the veggies with a bit of olive oil. When everything was done I pureed them together with my hand mixer (braun multi-practic) and added chicken stock.  It tasted really good at that point with all of the roasted vegetables but I also added a 1 tablespoon of mild curry paste and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes.

At the end of cooking I add a pint of heavy whipping cream to give it a more creamy consistency. It is lovely. When I just made this I just used acorn and speg. squash. I also add several carrots that have been cooked till soft. You could actually add sweet potato or pumpkin to this as well. It would all work well with the flavors. Just work with what you have or what you can find. I think leeks in lieu of onions would also be very nice. I do up the curry and add a bit more cayenne and garlic. Just keep playing until you find your perfect flavor for your family. We tend to like things with a bit more kick and flavorful bite. This is great with baguette and a nice salad. Try it with the pear and roqfort cheese salad from this site (can't remember the proper name of that recipe but it is wholly wonderful with this soup). Lastly I much prefer this recipe room temperature rather than heated. It is just my preference. It is also nice topped with cilantro.",

Left out the spaghetti squash and used the suggested amount of acorn and butternut. 2. Substituted Gala apples for Green. 3. Substituted Sherry with a white wine. Don't leave out the apples they really make the flavor. Great recipe! I will try it again making subtle variations for variety.",

I used 5 lbs of butternut squash (2 large squash), 6 apples, 4 pears and 9 cups of chicken broth and it was still not what I had hoped for. The flavor was okay - definitely used fresh ginger for a more full bodied taste - the ground ginger just doesn't cut it.",
