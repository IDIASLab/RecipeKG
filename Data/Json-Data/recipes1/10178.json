First of all, I didn't think the quantities would feed all of my guests, so I doubled the flour and butter, used an 8 oz package of light cream cheese, 1 cup of shredded swiss, 1 1/2 cups of cheddar, and a 32 oz of hash browns.  I also used fresh broccoli crowns - approx 1 1/2 pounds (before cleaned and cut up).  And last but not least, instead of the bread crumb topping, I put on the french fried onion rings.  I also defrosted the hash browns in the microwave before adding to the cheese sauce.  It was delicious, and filled a 9 x 11 casserole.  Couldn't see how a 12 oz bag of hash browns could feed 8 people.  I had only a small container of left overs and we only had 8 for dinner!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!",

I added finely diced onions, minced garlic and chopped green onions to the butter in the first step to add a bit more flavor, fresh broccoli (steamed)and I used soy milk instead of regular because I was out but it tasted WAY better with soy! I also used cheddar instead of swiss - I don't think this recipe is grown up enough for swiss, cheddar definitely fits better (and has more of a \"cheesy\" flavor) I will most definitely make this one again.",
