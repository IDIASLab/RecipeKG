Other additions include an extra pound of smoked ham, 3 stalks celery, 3 carrots, garlic powder, fresh parsley, thyme, marjoram, and sage. Thank you so much for this recipe!  I have finally outperformed the legendary mother-in-law.  Update: Freezing works on this soup, but I've recently decided I prefer halving the recipe so we can eat all of it fresh!",

Nice color, nice balance of flavors, very homey and comforting!  I served this with some great crusty rolls and a nice green salad, and it was a HUGE hit even with my finicky teens.  Here's what I did to \"doctor\" it up:  \r\n\r\nFirst, I cut back by half on the water.  Second, I added about a Tbsp or so each of fresh sage, thyme and parsley (toward the end of cooking) and maybe half that amount of dried marjoram (because I couldn't find any fresh).  Third, instead of ham hocks which my family doesn't like (or need :-)), I bought some wonderful smoky ham at the deli counter, cubed it up and added about 1/2 lb of it right at the beginning of cooking, then used the remainder to garnish.  I did add one chicken bouillon cube but used low sodium chicken broth and added no additional salt, and it came out nicely.  Last, I added some nice-sized chunks of carrots and celery, and cut my potatoes into larger chunks too, to give the soup a more hearty flavor and appearance.  \r\n\r\nOne last tip -- This recipe makes a very large batch of soup, and I knew we would tire of it before it was eaten.  So I froze half of it at the stage AFTER pureeing but BEFORE adding any milk.  We'll enjoy it again one wintry evening!",

I used 1/2 lb bacon instead of hamhocks (since I had it in my freezer already) frying the bacon in the stockpot disposing of 1/3 the grease and reserving the crispy bacon for garnish later. After the grease was cool I added the rest of the ingredients. I did take the bay out after 1/2 hour of simmering (afraid of too strong a taste) and reduced the amount of milk at the end as I thought this soup was too thin for my taste. I doubled the simmer time and it turned out just thick enough. I will use this recipe from now on!",

I made this recipe pretty much as instructed (I substituted a dash of cayenne for the red pepper flakes and substituted 1 tbsp \"TASTEFULLY SIMPLE brand spinach & herb mix\"...as it was the only thing on hand will dill in it). The recipe was way to watery for my family. I tried to salvage it by pureeing 3 cans of drained peas (it's all I had on hand) with a little of the broth and returned it to the pot. It was still watery so I thickened it with 1/2 c flour and 1 c water. This really increased the number of servings so as not to dilute the flavor I added 1/2 cup of TASTEFULLY SIMPLE product \"Bacon Bacon\" (dried seasoned bacon bits). The flavor of the soup was great... my 5 year old ate 3 bowls! I froze the remainder in single serving portions using a vacuum sealer system and will have soup for weeks to come!",

Turns out those great ratings were given by reviewers who changed the recipe. Add to that not being very familiar with making (only eating) pea soup I didn't see this one coming. VERY watery so either there's a mistake with the amount of liquid or this is not a traditional pea soup recipe. The flavor was a little weak as well when I compare it to others I've tasted. I never did add the milk at the end which would have watered it down even more. I tried adding instant potato flakes to thicken it which worked fairly well but didn't want to alter the flavor by adding too much. This really only needs the 6 cups of broth and no milk for that amount of split peas. Leave out the water all together.",
