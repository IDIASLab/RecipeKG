Quesadillas are one of my favorite foods and they wouldn't be complete without bell peppers so I chopped up an orange bell pepper and threw it in the mix. I spread a little butter on one side of the folded tortilla and baked them at 400 flipping them over half way. I cooked them for about 7 minutes on each side and they turned out perfect. The tortilla was lightly salted and crunchy...soooo good. Between my husband and I we gobbled down 6 of these. I could eat these everyday! Thanks for sharing.",

I then shredded it and mixed it with the salsa and a dollop of fat free sour cream to make it a little creamy. I did take another reviewer's suggestion and baked at 400 for 7 minutes then flipped and baked for 5 more minutes. The tortillas browned and crisped up perfectly. My fiance loved this so I will definitely make again. Great quick dinner. Thank you!:)",

I added one extra chicken breast and STILL had very sparsely covered tortillas. Baked in the oven they did indeed turn out crispy but not in a good way. They were dry. There is not enough substance inside the tortillas to even fill them halfway. Should you decide to make this recipe then use about 4 chicken breasts and about 1 cup of salsa. Then butter the tortillas and fry them up in the skillet. Much better this way.",
