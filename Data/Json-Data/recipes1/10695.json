This recipe is very, very close to what she made.  She never put the chocolate in her pie, but a lot of the other Italian ladies did.  We just omit the chocolate, and it's just like Grandma used to make!\r\nThank you so much for this recipe!!!\r\nOne beloved tradtion will continue through many more generations.",
