I sauteed garlic, sliced onions and sliced mushrooms in a little coconut oil before adding & simmering the sauce.  After adding the shrimp, and cooking it, I stirred in cooked penne pasta, and tossed to coat it.  We'll definitely be making this again, and as another reviewer suggested, try it with chicken.",
