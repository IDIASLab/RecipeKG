I used small whole cabbage calabas carrots onion small red potatoes tomatoes and I cooked meat first for 45min(alone) then I added the vegtables and continued to cook for 1 more hour; This receipe throw it all in at once vegtable like cabbage and potato/carrots will break apart if cooked to much. All it all it came out well my husband loved it!! I do believe its better than his Moms!! PS.. he's asked me to make it again. oh!! I also added just a few shakes of TONY CHECERIES seasoning for flavor; and Use Limes when served to squeeze on top.",
