I agree with another reviewer that this cake should be renamed, \"chocolate oil cake\" doesn't sound very appealing, but the cake is really great!Update: I used this recipe for cupcakes, took 20 minutes to bake and came out really good -I got 24 cupcakes out of this recipe.

This recipe is certainly rich and chocolately but I didn't find it chewy at all just wonderfully moist. I think the results are excellent if you want a very moist cake and especially if you don't happen to have eggs handy. The only change I would make is to add a little more salt to the recipe. I made this for a friend's birthday and covered it with whipped cream and fresh strawberries. It was incredibly good. This is my new favorite chocolate cake recipe. Thanks for sharing it!",
