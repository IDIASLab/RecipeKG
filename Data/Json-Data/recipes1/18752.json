There was too little liquid with the original recipe ingredients and the potatoes would not have cooked.  I also thought the broth was bland, so, I added some chicken bouillon for flavor.  My suggestion would be to use chicken or beef broth instead of the water.  Once adjustments were made the recipe was delicious!",
