I used salt, pepper and thyme leaves as my seasonings and after cooked until everything was very tender, I processed in batches in my food processor(leaving some chunks for texture). I then returned to my soup pot and slowly stirred in about 1 1/2 c. of cheddar. Delicious!!!",

I also had some leftover brocolli, spinach, and half of a tomato which I also added.  In addition to that, I minced my veggies in the food processor instead of chopping them, which cut down on the cooking time of my soup.  All in all it turned out just wonderful.

I did tweak it a little...I didn't use any water I used 2 cans of chicken broth...no milk and no flour...I also didn't put the carrots in...I didn't want to over do the veggies.

I make a few changes: 1) I omit the potatoes 2) instead of putting the onions in the water to boil I slice up a lb of smoked sausage (ie: Polska Kielbasa) and fry the slices with the onions. 3) Add the onions and drained sausage when the cauliflower and other veggies are tender 4)After adding the roux use velveeta (and a little more of it) and stir until melted. Very good and creamy soup! This works as a great way to warm you winter nights!!",
