Second while browning the onions/garlic/beef I added a good dash of all-season salt. Then when it came time to add the beans/tomatoes I omitted the kidney beans (none available) BUT I added a 15oz can of tomato sauce and a couple good shakes of paprika and cumin. Once you let this simmer - it thickens nicely and the flavors are GREAT! We didn't serve over rice b/c we thought it was great w/out it BUT we did sprinkle some sharp cheddar cheese over our bowls to melt. Great recipe and with the small changes I made - I will definately make this again...esspecially at our cabin this fall! Good & hearty! Thanks!",

It's also great when I decide to spice it up and make it hot with some hot sauce and hot pepper flakes. It's a great treat that can be adapted to anyone's taste. Bravo!
