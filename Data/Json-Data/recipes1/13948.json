I was skeptical of a banana dessert so I gave it a test run by cutting the recipe down to yield 5 servings. I cut a small loaf of french bread into about 1 inch cubes and used a banana flavored rum. I poured the mixture into a small loaf pan and threw it into the toaster oven. I did also find that I didn't need to keep it in there for more than 60 minutes but that's probably more because I was baking a smaller portion. I pushed the toast button for the last few minutes to make the top crispier which I thought complemented the bread pudding texture wonderfully! I followed the other reviewer's suggestion and also made the sauce (I used the recipe from Bananas Foster II submitted by Buttermebread) which was phenomenal drizzled over the pudding and vanilla ice cream! Excellent and definitely a keeper! Will be making the whole recipe and sharing the joy with others!",

I made it on Sunday night for dessert  to go with the bananas foster II recipe from this site & a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Both were awesome, but honeslty I think it was overkill to make both as they were both so good that it was hard to enjoy them indivdually. Luckily I had about half a tray left and brought a slice (okay fine a huge chunk!) to work for breakfast the next day. HEAVEN!! By the tiem I got home i wanted another slice but sadly my family had gobbled it up. You MUST try this recipe!!  *The only thing I changed was using rum instead of banana liquor as I wanted to keep the cost down and already had rum on hand. ",
