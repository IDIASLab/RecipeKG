I followed recommendations of using less tomato products so I cut it down to 26 1/2 oz. can of tomato sauce and 14.5 oz. of crushed tomatoes. That worked for me. I don't like cooked peas so I added frozen peas when the meat mixture was almost cooked. I didn't have green pepper so I substituted red pepper. I added 1 T. of chili pdr. to spice it up, next time I will increase it to 2 T. chili pdr. Thank you for submitting this recipe, I will definately prepare it again.",

I used 8 ounces of macaroni, 1 lb of ground beef, only one can of tomato paste and sauce, and I didn't add the water. Everything else I pretty much left the same. I did use frozen peas though, since we're not too big on canned peas. I also threw in whatever seasoning I thought would be good, so I used some ground mustard, Italian seasoning, basil, and some crushed red pepper. I topped it with a little shredded cheddar and served it with some crusty bread.",

I also thought the tomato base was a little too over powering but to change that all I had to do was cut out the tomato paste and I used diced tomatoes w/ Basil instead of stewed. I also wanted mine to be a little less \"watery\" so I omitted the water and just used the juices from the canned tomotoes. My son is allergic to peas and corn so I made him a bowl excluding those ingredients and adding diced carrots & Broccoli. This is a very versatile recipe where you can add spice take away use different meats such as sausage hamburger stew meat etc. The same with vegetables according to your likes and dislikes! Have fun with it and find the right niche for your family!",
