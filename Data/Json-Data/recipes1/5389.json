I make a double or triple batch, and freeze the extras after rolling.  When I'm ready to prepare I take out the amount needed and put in a baking dish, throw on the sauce and cheese and into the oven.  The second and third times I serve it from frozen are even better than the first batch that doesn't see the freezer!  Using the other reviewers suggestions, I omit the water, substitute salsa for the tomato sauce, chopped chiles for the green pepper, red enchilada sauce for the taco sauce, and use reduced fat cheddar. I poach my chicken in some chicken broth and herbs, then shred it with 2 forks.  I've also tried it with a supermarket roasted chicken, but my family likes it best when I've poached it.  Sooooo delicious!",

Instead of the green pepper I use green chiles, more chili powder, and a few dashes of ground cayenne pepper to spice it up.  I also use very little water and about half of the recommended tomato sauce.  For a rich and creamy flavor, try adding a few tablespoons of cream cheese and some Monterey Jack--it's wonderful!  I've also added refried beans to these enchiladas and they turned out great. Overall, this recipe needed some modifying to suit my tastes (I also used red enchilada sauce rather than salsa), but it's a good base for the best chicken enchiladas I've made yet!",

I prepare the chicken in chicken broth and shred instead of cube. Next I add the cheese and other ingredients but I do not use tomato sauce or water for the filling. I also add green chiles to this mixture. I then roll and place in the pan. I use enchilada instead of taco sauce as the topping. I find the flavor is better. I do not buy the commercial brands of the sauce (like El Paso) which can taste strange and instead look for a Mexican variety. These are a big crowd pleaser and it is easy to multiply the recipe for large groups. I highly recommend them!",

YOU MUST:  Poach your chicken with a mixture of poultry seasonings, cumin, minced garlic, tomato sauce, and chicken broth.  This will make your chicken FABULOUS and trust me, this makes all the difference in the taste of the enchilada!!!  Substitued a 1/2 jar of Ariba Roasted Mexican Red Salsa (medium) and a 12 ounce bottle of La Victoria red taco sauce (mild) for the water and tomato sauce (much needed change).  Also cuts down on the sogginess other reviewers have complained about!    Used the Red Enchilada Sauce from this site to finish it off.  Absolutely superb!!!  HELPFUL HINT: this recipe freezes extremely well.  Thanks Debbie for a great recipe to build on for personal preference!!!",

She mentioned growing up in Texas and exposed to much better enchiladas. Same here for Cali, where I am from and live. I figure that must be why we are so picky, this is nothing more than a smothered burrito. And not a very good one at that. With the spices used, you'd think it would have some flavor. But not! How the heck did this recipe get in a cookbook? First of all, I've yet to find a flour tortilla enchilada recipe that was actually worth making a second time. But you know what? That darn number, 533 ratings, 415 reviews, 5 star average, and published in a cookbook, really suckered me in. I'm dumbfounded still by it, and wish more people would be more honest. I'd like to know if the people who said it was the best had ever made real enchiladas before. I'd like to know where they are from and their cooking experience. I am sending the rest of the enchiladas to my husbands work tomorrow and asking him to put a sign on the breakroom fridge offering them to people for free. I am not trying to be rude or mean or slam the author of the recipe. I'm just frustrated at wasting my time & money on something only to be be extrememly dissatisfied.\r\n\r\nI've gone through every single rating now, bewildered still. There are other's that agree, I urge anyone that is trying this recipe to read them all first.",

                "reviewBody": "The overall taste of this recipe is great. However I made the recipe without reading the reviews first and was sorry. Omit the water or you will have a soupy mess. I made do by using a slotted spoon to put the chicken peppers and onions into the tortilla shells and then pouring the rest of the mixture over the top along with the taco sauce. I used 8\" wheat tortillas and that seemed to work well in the casserole dish. next time I will use precooked chicken to cut down on the time. This is not exactly a quick supper. Also a whole tablespoon of chili powder was a bit much for me and I wasn't able to offer it to my toddler.",
