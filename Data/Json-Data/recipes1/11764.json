Huge thing I did notice was that it is very important you use a METAL dish rather than a glass one.  Never, ever turned out properly in the glass dish!  Use exactly 2.5 lbs of RED potatoes and cut them a bit bigger than diced, bit smaller than quartered, unsalted butter all the way through and if you don't have seasoned breadcrumbs, add parmesan, Italian Seasoning and garlic salt to the plain kind and it'll turn out perfectly.  Double your ham, and use extra melted unsalted butter on the crumbs. I have honestly made this for dozens and dozens of people and have yet for a single person to not love it!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Terri! PS Also makes great leftovers!",

I salted the water to boil the potatoes, but I completely forgot to season the dish.  The next time I make this, I will pepper to taste, but leave out the salt entirely - between the ham, soup, and cheese, it didn't need any (and I general like more salt than most people).  I used a pound of deli sliced honey ham, chopped, and it was perfect.  The only suggestion I have is to mix everything except the potatoes in a large bowl FIRST, and then combine.  It's a very large dish, so it was a little difficult to mix.  It was delicious though, and I will definitely make this again.  Perfect for a potluck, we had tons of leftovers.",

Less potatoes cut in small pieces more soup more ham NO SALT! Everyone in the house loved it. LOVED it. My husband asks for it all the time! I like as well but it is a bit salty even with eliminating the salt which is odd but I am the only one in the family that is a salt-aholic. I can't seem to locate a low salt or no salt Cream of Chix soup but I will see if I can find a low salt ham to use instead.",
