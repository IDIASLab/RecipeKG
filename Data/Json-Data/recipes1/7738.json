This recipe is a dream to make; very easy and everybody loves to eat it freshly sliced toasted and spread with cream cheese or split and sprinkled with liquer and fresh fruit and whipped creme. As another reviewer did I served it with orange juice glaze (oj powdered sugar vanilla extract almond extract). A little advanced warning: make it in two loaf pans and hide the second way back in the freezer. Otherwise you could end up eating the whole tube pan in a few days!",
