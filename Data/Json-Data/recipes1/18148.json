I used Rodelle gourmet vanilla.  My thinking was to make a choco-type bread spread like Nutella to abate my morning sweet tooth, but this is worthy of eating by the spoonful.  I put the mixture back into the 8 ounce cheese container and 1/16 of the container is 6.5 carbs.  For those not counting carbs, this is still a wonderful tasting treat.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.",
