Not dry at all.  I did NOT use the pumpkin pie spice and they do NOT taste like pumpkin at all.  Just chocolate cupcakes.  Thank so much.  We love these!  (I also substituted a tiny (5oz) can of evaporated milk for the heavy cream.  I used a 4oz kids sized applesauce pack and 1/2c butter because it's what I had.)",

Used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream. Didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so found the substitution for it and added maybe a 1/2 Tbsp more cinnamon and ginger and tsp more nutmeg and allspice. ( really wanted to taste the pumpkin    spices)   Also added chocolate chips as mentioned in other reveiws, sprinkled some on top of cake as well.  Loved it very moist, cake and the icing was extremely sweet but   perfect for spicy chocolate cake.  Looked fabulous too served this at a dinner party and it was ooohed and ahhed!!",

My son even requested it for his birthday cake!  I live overseas in a country that doesn't have premade pumpkin puree or applesauce, so I made them myself (thanks, phatcat, for the Sarah's applesauce recipe!).  It does take my cake at least an hour to cook, but it's still moist, and  I like for my frosting to cool a bit and become more solid than a glase.  The last time I made the frosting I even added some caramels to make it even sweeter. This one is a keeper!",
