I used a 3 lb. turkey breast (the recipe calls for 1.5 lb.) and cooked uncovered at 350 F for an hour and a half. I doubled the sauce and spices but ended up with too much of those. It came out perfect- absolutely moist and cooked through. I poured the juices over the final product. In terms of the cranberry sauce: I would really recommend increasing the brown sugar significantly- not as good for you but the sauce was way too bitter without it.",
