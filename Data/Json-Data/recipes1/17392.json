                "reviewBody": "This is a wonderful recipe, absolutely delicious.  My two cents: It's a good idea to calibrate your candy thermometer anytime you're making something where the temperature is critical.  Rapidly boil water and test the temperature of the boil with your thermometer.  Water boils at 212 degrees at sea level.  Where I am, water boils at 215 degrees, so I add the extra three degrees onto the temperature of whatever I am making.  My other hint is that when you're filling your sink with cold water, do not fill it more than a few inches.  The point is to rapidly cool your syrup so that it doesn't continue to cook.  I had too much water in my sink which made my pot float.  As I was struggling to let some water out, a whole gush of cold water spilled into my pot and ruined my entire batch :(  So sad when maple syrup is so pricey!  But once I got it right, it was fabulous!",
