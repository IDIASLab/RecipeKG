I would consider using less egg and bread crumbs next time because the combination of the two usually make the burger tough but the bread crumbs add really good flavor (used Italian seasoned). If you want the burger spicier I would suggest some extra Cayenne pepper. Definitely keeping this recipe for my next bbq!",
