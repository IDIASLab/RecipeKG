This can be varied so many different way using whichever grahams are your favorite and rolling it in other toppings (chopped nuts sprinkles chopped candy canes) and it's always the first to get eaten. I like it best with chocolate or cinnamon grahams.",

I figured out the ratio so that it could be adapted into all sizes (which is 4:1:3:3 of cookie crumbs butter chocolate and topping respectively by the way) because I wasn't quite sure that it would turn out nicely and wanted to downsize it but now I see that it would have been fine to keep it in its original larger form! All gone within one afternoon. I froze them for a little while after making as they were quite gooey and then they turned out heavenly. We used all sorts of things as topping not just coconut - ground haselnuts chopped pecans sprinkles chopped butterscotch chips... be creative. Lovely recipe.",
