It's also much better so I don't think I'll be getting the store bought stuff anymore. I cut the recipe in half and used Hellman's light mayo combined with a bit of light sour cream to make it a little creamier along with some finely chopped green onion as it's very mild. All it needed was a bit of dill to punch it up.  It was perfect over beer battered fish filet sandwiches!",
