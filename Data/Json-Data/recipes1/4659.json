If you want to really \"frost\" the cake with the suggested frosting you need to prepare it while the cake is baking and then chill it to thicken it up. You really need to be careful to prepare the pan or it will stick. For those who really must be strict about their diets this isn't a bad option. It isn't flat and tasteless as so many are and it doesn't call for odd or difficult to find ingredients. I will try it again.",

I added a bit more juice concentrate to the frosting to give it more flavor. You also have to make sure the top layer of frosting is thick enough because when it sits for a bit the cake looks spotty in areas that have little icing. The hardest part was not tearing the cake when trying to put the two halves back together. I found that you could substitute any unsweetened fruit juice concentrate if you happen to be out of apple. --a sugar conscious mom",

I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 2 tsps of vanilla since people complained of blandness. Still I was skeptical but it was wonderful to me... and more importantly to my kids (one is having a piece with her breakfast right now)! Maybe it's just because we've been off of sugars and artificial sweeteners for a while now... but I don't think so. We're typically a pretty hard win! Thanks for sharing this recipe.",
