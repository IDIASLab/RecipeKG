However I didn t find anything to really differentiate this from other egg salads that I ve had. Horseradish is a distinctive ingredient for egg salad so you could kick it up by adding more of that but I didn t want more horseradish flavor. It was O.K. just pretty standard egg salad IMO not that there s anything wrong with that.",
