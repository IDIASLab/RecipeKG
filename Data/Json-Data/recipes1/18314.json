I made half a batch just as the recipe suggested, using a small cookie scoop with a yield of about 20 cookies.  I smushed them down with my meat tenderizer for the design to about 3/8\", and the final product turned out to be about 1/4\" high and 2\" wide.  I say I had trouble with the cooking time, and I don't think it is with my oven, though I will test it to make sure it is calibrated correctly.  After about 35 minutes at 250, I turned the oven up to 275 to finish off the first batch.  The second batch I cooked for about 30 minutes at 275.  You really just want them to start to turn golden brown.  The end result is a very tender and light cookie---just perfect with a cup of coffee!  I'm surprised these made it with only one review after a whole year of sitting there!  I'm glad I found these!  Thanks, Proud Albertan!",

Also chilled dough for 1 hour formed in to log and then chilled. Then sliced in to 1/4\" pieces. Try rolling cooled cookies in icing sugar or adding butterscotch chips to dough both came out excellent. These cookies are easy to make and just a few ingredients that are on hand. Also used baking paper on cookie sheet. Cook til a medium brown. MAKE SURE AFTER YOU BAKE FOR 30 MIN CHANGE TEMP TO 275 AND COOK FOR 10 TO 15 MIN MORE. IF NECESSARY COOK EVEN LONGER. WHEN DONE THEY SHOULD MELT IN YOUr MOUTH. I've added all sorts of extra's like: heath pieces choc chip peanut butter and once I dipped them in chocolate. These cookies are fun to experiment with.",
