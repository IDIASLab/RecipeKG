These don't crumble as easily as other recipes I've tried, and seem like they'd work well as decorated cut-outs (we ate them plain). I like my shortbread just a touch sweeter, so I added a couple tablespoons more sugar to the second batch--YUM! You could also sprinkle a little extra sugar on top before baking if desired. If it won't roll out well, try chilling it for about 30 minutes in the fridge first, especially if you didn't use cold butter. Or add a little more flour if it's sticky. I also suggest you use your (clean) hands to mix the dough, to get that perfect, smooth texture!",

I used confectioners sugar instead of white, (I added 1/4 cup more for a little extra sweetness) added a tablespoon of vanilla, and replaced a tablespoon of flour for corn starch. I did not need to refrigerate the dough, in fact I used a little less of the flour mixture and rolled up 1 inch balls and placed them on the cookie sheet. Then I flattened them with a fork, pushed a little hole in the middle and filled them with jam. mmmmmmm yummmy!",
