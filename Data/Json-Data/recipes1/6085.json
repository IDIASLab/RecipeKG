I only added half the worchestershire called for. I didn't have any celery so I added an extra 1/2C of grapes. Next time I will cut the grapes in half. I also added more bacon than what was called for(about eight slices). When I was baking my chicken for this I put my bacon in the oven too. Different pan though. I made my sauce first so it could sit for an hour or so as someone else suggested. Good idea! I served this with Peppy's Pita Bread (on this site). Big hit. Try both recipes.",

Modifications will be a matter of personal choice, but I would second letting the salad sit for a while for the flavor to really build up.  I tasted it when made immediately and then after an hour.  Wow!  The flavor just gets better.  I will probable scale back the mayo a little but not much.  I think subbing dried currants instead of the grapes would be a nice option.",
