I ended up with all the ingredients simmering away in the pot and then used my immersion blender to puree everything right in the pot.  Excellent flavor and seasonings.  I also added some dry mashed potato flakes to thicken it up at the end instead of the butter/flour.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

I made it for my book club and all the gals raved about it. I did make a few changes. First, I used canned diced tomatoes. I also sauted two chopped red peppers and used one roasted red pepper from a jar, putting them all in at the same time instead of reserving one for the end of the recipe. Instead of making the roux I added some cornstarch to a bit of the broth, stirred until smooth, and then mixed that into the soup. Finally, instead of the sour cream I added a few tablespoons of cream to the entire batch before serving. Wonderful!",

Based on other reviews, I used 4 red peppers and in place of fresh tomatoes (which are terrible this time of year, at least here) I used 2 (14 oz) cans of diced, peeled tomatoes.  I also did not reserve a pepper for use later.  People here at work that tasted it loved it as well.  Despite the effort (most of which is in the cooking time), this will be a soup I readily will make again.  In the future, I may or may not continue to use the roux (this time I did use it), but it looked ready to go without the roux being necessary.  Thanks, Carol!",

This allowed for the onions to carmelize and the garlic to let out more flavor than jst crushed. The flavor improves with time. Served this soup at a church lunch and it was a hit. Also did not have thyme so i subbed dried basil. For the salt I used coarse sea salt.",
