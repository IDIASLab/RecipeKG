If the fact that I made what I thought would be for two nights ended up being only enough for tonight says anything, then it will speak to how much Hubs and I enjoyed this.  Bland?  Not for us, but we appreciate the flavor of the food itself and don\u2019t like masking it with a lot of distracting seasoning. For that reason, I didn\u2019t even use the ginger, which neither of us cares for.  The sesame oil adds just what is needed for complexity of flavor and I also added a dribble of mirin (sweet rice wine) to the cornstarch/soy sauce/ chicken broth mixture.  While it wasn\u2019t necessary, I knew it would be a good fit.  Instead of garlic powder I tossed in some fresh, minced, tho\u2019 I don\u2019t think the dish would suffer using the garlic powder as directed.  For the \u201ccut up fresh vegetables\u201d I used what I had in the fridge \u2013 zucchini, mushrooms, sweet onion and baby bok choy.   As for the shrimp, I used the big guys, 16-20 count. I tossed them in the hot pan straight from the freezer and they were done in just a few minutes \u2013 in other words, don\u2019t even bother thawing them first.  I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll make this again \u2013 exactly the same way.",
