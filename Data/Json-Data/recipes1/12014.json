My only complaint was that once I got the icing on there, the combination was a little too sweet for me. I think I would cut back on the sugar in the cake it's self, as the icing was really yummy. I will deffinetly make this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe! :)",

Pleasantly autumn spiced with nice chunks of sweet apple (I used apples from our tree and I haven't a clue what they are - all I know is that they are sweet and hold their shape). The frosting was gorgeous. I generally have no problem using shortening in frostings particularly if I need it to be pure white but in this case I felt this frosting begged for butter. Since there was already a fair amount of nutmeg in the cake I used apple pie spice instead of nutmeg in the frosting as I'm not a fan of too much nutmeg. I beat the frosting a good long time which made it luxuriously fluffy and smooth. Once frosted I sprinkled it all over with freshly ground cinnamon/sugar.",
