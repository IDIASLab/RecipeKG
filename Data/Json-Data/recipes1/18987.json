It was left over from a ham we ate on Easter.I thought it would be similar because it has balsamic vinegar in it. It added a sweet heat to the savory tart. I also added three slices of chopped Canadian bacon for protein this added smokiness that went nicely with the other toppings. This tart is an interesting option for using up fresh basil and tomatoes when one's tired of caprese salad. I can only give it four stars because I haven't tried the recipe as is.
