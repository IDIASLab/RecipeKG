So happy I know how to make these at home now. Oh for anyone who doesn't know how to make the syrup I just put some regular sugar in a bowl and fill it with enough water just to cover the sugar (about 4 tablespoons of sugar). Put it in the microwave for about a minute or until the sugar disolves then add a little vanilla extract. Delicious!",
