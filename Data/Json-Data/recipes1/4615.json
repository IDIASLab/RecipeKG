I used 3 small boxes of sugar-free Jello which shouldn t have affected the texture of the filling (can t imagine what 4 boxes would have done). While cooking the filling was so thick that I did add some more water to it (apparently not enough) but the texture of the filling once chilled was VERY FIRM to put it mildly totally congealed into almost a rubbery filling and there wasn t enough to really fill the pie shell. If you think about it if you were mixing up 4 boxes of Jello in total you d be using 8 cups of water. This recipe specifies one cup of water and then you add 4 Tbsp of cornstarch as well?? I added half the amount of sugar but it still was just waaaaay too sweet; IMO it doesn t need any sugar at all. I m sure you could tweak this recipe to make it work but I think I ll just move on. SCHLETTE so sorry for the poor review but this pie was a disappointment.",
