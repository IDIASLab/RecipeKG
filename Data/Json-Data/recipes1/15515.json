I have used both Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage and mild Venison sausage both are wonderful. The added milk keeps the balls moist and not doughy. The herbs add the perfect amount of flavor missing from the 3 ingredient version and u can never have too much cheese in my house. If u enjoy this recipe another family favorite is the Bisquick Breakfast Casserole. Both recipes are tasty and simple. I hope your family enjoys these as much as my family does. ",
