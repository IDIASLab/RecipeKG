I also used 1/3 cup of oil. I baked them at 400 for 10-12 minutes and they were perfect. Very moist but not greasy, and just the right amount of lemony flavor.

The followed some advice by others the second time around and definitely more moisture is needed.  So I used 2 lemon burst yogurt cups, 6 oz. each, which 1 and 1/2 cups total.  I also used 1/3 cup of oil rather than only 1/4 cup.  I did not measure out my poppy seeds.  I just used a small little plastic jar of Tone's poppy seeds, which was somewhere between 1/8 and 1/4 cup.  (I can see where 1/4 cup might have been pushing it, the amount I used was plenty!)  I kept everything else the same and baked in giant muffins tins which made 6 muffins total for me.  I dropped the temperature to 375 so the outside wouldn't cook too fast, leaving the middle raw.  They came out perfectly, and the the rose nicely giving a decently-rounded top.  The lemon/sugar mixture was perfect to pour over the top.  This really gives the muffins their flavor.  Oh, and I followed the advice a few other cooks and added a tablespoon of lemon extract along with the lemon zest to the batter.  This is a great place to start with a lemon poppy seed muffin, just needs more liquids and it's perfect!  Thanks for sharing.  :-)",

I made several changes to the wet ingredients though which I think helped. I used: 2 eggs 1 6oz container plain Greek yogurt (standard single-serving size) 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 1 cup of plain applesauce. The addition of the applesauce makes a huge difference to the moistness and you can't taste it at all. I also used the zest from 2 lemons which was probably closer to 1.5 or 2 Tbsp because I wanted to make sure they were really lemony and they are - not really tart just very flavorful. I also used half white and half whole wheat flour (1 cup each) which I always do when making muffins so I can pretend to myself they are somewhat healthier. They turned out really well with these modifications!",
