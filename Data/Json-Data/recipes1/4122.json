I added garlic eggs mozzarella and parmesan to the filling mixture and do use spaghetti sauce rather than tomato sauce. I also solved the problem of filling the shells by putting the filling mixture in a plastic zip-lock bag cutting off the corner and squeezing the mixture into the shells. This worked like a dream! The shells were filled in no time. For you seasoned chefs a pastry bag or cookie press would also work well. Once perfected I will post my version.",

I added 1 egg Italian seasoning garlic salt a small handful of grated Italian cheese parmesan and crushed red pepper to the cheese/spinach mixture. I took the advice of others and piped into the manicotti using a ziploc w/the corner cut off. I also used an entire \"big\" jar of spaghetti sauce. Quick easy yummy...thanks for a great recipe!",
