I went ahead as planned and I'm here to tell you that some kind of magic went down in that fridge while it sat in there an hour. This was sinfully good! The texture reminded me of old fashioned churned butter. The consistency was not too hard not too soft and the unattractive oily glob appearance it had when it went in completely disappeared. This was the bomb! I dipped both pretzels and raw veggies in it and they were equally as good. I just made this last night and have already recommended to 5 different people at work. Awesome recipe!",
