Only problem I had was that it was still a bit runny in the center after the specified cooking time though it still went very well with ice-cream. When I make this again I might play round with the temp and cooking time and I'll probably leave out the cinnamon as I found that to be a bit much. Otherwise this was a good recipe and really did go well with ice-cream.",
