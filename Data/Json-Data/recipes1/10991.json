My bread making stuff was still accessible so I figured I'd give this recipe a shot. I may never make cookies again this bread turned out so moist and perfect.The only thing I changed a little was I added a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and probably a few more chocolate chips than the recipe calls for (I didn't measure I just tossed them in at the beep). I also added a bit more flour during the first kneading cycle because the dough was more like a batter at that point. A lot of chips settled to one side of the pan where the kneading didn't quite get to them which left a nice crust of chocolate on one end but next time I'll watch the time more closely to try to get the chips in just before the second kneading cycle (when my machine beeps for additions) so the chocolate chips might mix a bit better. I had my chocolate chips in the freezer which may have helped a bit. Since I would have loved this information when looking at reviews my bread machine is a Sunbeam 5891 and the fruit/nut beep seemed to be right on.",

I have no bread machine so I did the kneading on my KA. I let it rise 3 times and my bread baked up so high and fluffy. I had to use 1 cup more flour but that is because our weather here is so humid. Baked it in the oven at 350 for about 35 minutes. I added a little cocoa powder in place of the cinnamon and will increase the cocoa to 1tbsp because we love chocolate here. Mmm.
