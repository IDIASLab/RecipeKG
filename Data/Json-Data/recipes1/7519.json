I agree with other reviewers that it should be thicker and I roughly doubled the flour before deciding to wait and see how it turned out when it had cooled. I also agree with the reviewer who suggested that the cucumber not be peeled. When I make it again I might add a half a small cabbage shredded. Continuing to agree with other reviewers I only cooked it about ten minutes before processing in jars. With all of that it cooks quite a while beyond the stove top cooking. As I like the taste of the AMORA brand piccalilli that we bought in France (basically their regular mustard with the veggies added) I will probably double up on the mustard next time. I don't want to take away from this excellent recipe but as many cooks do I'll modify it to my own tastes moving forward and I am delighted that Ruth shared it with us.",
