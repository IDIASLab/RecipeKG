Also I substituted light corn syrup for the golden syrup (I didn't have golden syrup-- in fact I've never heard of it). And lastly I added a tsp of almond flavoring.

The only changes I made where to add a little more liquid to the batter use hand chopped almonds and to reduce the cooking time to 12-15 mins. They tasted nice and very anzac'y although next time I would include some dessicated coconut as to me they did not taste quite complete without it. Thankyou Allison this recipe is definately worth trying.",

Instead of rolled oats I used ground bran flakes which in combination with the syrup made this delightfully gooey center surrounded by a crispy butter crust. As for the \"golden syrup\" I decided to mix 1/2 honey and 1/2 maple syrup. Of course in doing so I accidently doubled the amount of the \"golden syrup\" in the recipe. =/ I subsituted Splenda for the sugar and other than that it was the same. Haha. =) The cookie/biscuits were so good they were gone nearly as soon as my family discovered the pan!",

They didn't have much flavor despite the almonds and tasted really sweet and bland. Maybe they could use a pinch of salt to bring out the flavor and some almond extract?
