I didn't have stuffing so I used 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs, and replaced the Italian seasoning with crushed Italian croutons. I brushed on olive oil instead of melting butter on the chicken and then coated it, and it came out perfectly after baking it 15 min per side. I added some mozarella on the top after turning them. Great! Served it on top of pasta tossed with olive oil and oregano with sauteed red peppers on the side.",

I put 3 chicken breasts at a time in a 1 gallon freezer bag and pounded the breasts so they were more even in thickness. I also dipped the breasts in butter and then breaded it. I used seasoned cornbread stuffing and of course more curry and parmesean. (because we love curry and parmesean) Then I placed the chicken in a dish sprayed with PAM and turned 1/2 way through cooking. It browned up nicely and the breading stayed on. It was a hit! Plus I made it ahead of time and just had to take it out of the fridge and put in the ove. LOVED IT. Thanks for the new recipe.",
