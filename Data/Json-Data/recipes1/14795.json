I have made cheesecakes for years though & thought I'd give it a try. After reading the reviews, I automatically increased the spices - cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons, nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon  & cloves to 1/4 teaspoon. I also set aside 2 cups of plain cheesecake as opposed to 1 1/2 to make it not too \"pumpkinny\". I also baked it in a water bath. It was the most delicious, light & creamy cheescake! The spices were perfect and it had the hint of pumpkin without it being overwhelming. I am definitely making this every single Thanksgiving. And by the way, all the pumpkin haters couldn't get enough.",
