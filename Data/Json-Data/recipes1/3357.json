The first and most important change is to under-cook the potatoes: and I mean only cook 50% through. Making the potato cubes smallish helps (if not over-cooked). Secondly adding a can of corn niblets makes for a better end product. Lastly; I'd go for 1 & 1/4lb of bacon. This makes quite a big pot of soup and 1lb bacon dosen't quite make it but adding some fatback or slab bacon wo0uld also help.",

I did not use bacon (my husband is not a huge fan) and substituted with chicken as reccomended by others. I used half & half chicken broth and milk to make up the 8 cups of liquid. I did find that it was somewhat bland for my taste therefore I also added shredded carrots extra frozen corn garlic green pepper cayenne pepper rosemary and thyme. It's a great base recipe for chowder and makes alot. My husband loved it and I was able to freeze some. Thank you for sharing",
