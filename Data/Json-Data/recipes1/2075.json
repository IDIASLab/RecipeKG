After slicing I recommend putting the slices in a colander while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.  You may be surprised at how much juice comes off while they sit.  Don't slice them directly into the crust or you will get soupy pie!\r\n\r\n- Serve soon after baking.  It's a beautiful pie fresh from the oven but as it sits it looks less attractive (the topping absorbs the liquid).  Still tastes good but if you're having company I would do everything up to the placing the topping ahead of time, then put the topping on and bake when you're ready to serve.",

Plus, I made a pie filling instead of just putting the peaches in -- this way it would be soupy. The filling had juice from one small lemon, about 1/2cup to 3/4 cup of sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and about 1-2 tablespoons of cornstarch  mixed with a tiny amount of water to thicken it up. I didn't do a lot of measuring on the filling so those are estimations. I just didn't want a soupy pie, and I knew this would work.\r\nIt turned out super. I made an extra for my husband to take to work. This recipe is a keeper.",

I used brown sugar instead of white, added 1/4tsp of cinnamon and a dash of allspice.  I coated the peaches in the mixture then placed in the pie crust.  As a topping, I mixed 1/4cup butter, 1/3cup+1TBS flour, 1/4cup brown sugar, and 1/4cup white sugar, then placed flattened chunks of dough on top.  It made the pie look nice on top, and gave it a slightly crunchy texture.  **Be sure to cut the peach slices thick, otherwise they get cooked down too much and it makes the filling soupy. Tastes great any way you eat it--hot, cold, or al a mode!",

I cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup added 1/3 cup of brown sugar 1/3 cup rolled oats and one extra tbls of butter. I also tossed the peaches in flour before adding to the pie. It wasn't runny at all and it's hard to tell if it would've been had a not used the flour. I also set the stove to broil for a minute to crispen up the top crust. It came out really good.

I tossed the peaches with flour as others suggested, and added a little brown sugar to the peaches too. They just weren't very sweet. Then I doubled the crumble recipe as other suggested and added both cinamon and nutmeg.  I had plenty of crumble left to completely cover the pie. I cooked it 450 for 10 mins then 350 for 40 mins and it was perfect. I used the middle rack in my oven and wrapped the edges of the crust with foil until about ten mins before it was done. Oh yeah, this recipe is a keeper especially since I found a way to use frozen peaches. thanks for the recipe.",
