Instead of just putting 1 T of soy sauce over the beef strips, I marinated them in 1/2 C soy, plus the garlic and cornstarch. Then before I stir-fried it, I strained off most of the excess soy sauce. Worked fine, but I did have to add a little extra cornstarch at the end to get the sauce to thicken. This is definitely a keeper, thanks for the recipe!",

I also added some mushrooms but that's cause i just had some left. One thing i really missed in the marinade was some ketjap manis (indonesian very sugary type of soy sauce) for extra flavour so i added 2 tablespoons. I also reduced the red peper. Overal it came out awesome served with some plain white rice. But there was lotsa preperation and it would have been bland and way too hot (just peper flavour) without the adjustments.",
