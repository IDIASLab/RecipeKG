I also used 1 Tbsp olive oil instead of the butter used a mixture of zucchini & squash and added 2 chopped green onions and 3 chopped artichoke hearts to the vegetable saute. I used lowfat cottage cheese replaced the yogurt with fat-free sour cream used Eggbeaters instead of the eggs and added 1 Tbsp parsley to the cottage cheese mixture. Baked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes; it turned out wonderfully! My husband and I almost polished it off just between the two of us.",
