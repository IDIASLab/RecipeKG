The flavor after that is nothing great although not bad. The inside was nice and chewy but the whole cookie had a pretty thick hard outer shell that I didn't care for. Maybe that wouldn't happen if it wasn't rolled in sugar? I followed the recipe exactly. I was unsure about using the full amount of the dry mixture cause the dough got pretty crumbly and tough to mix but I did. I think if I make this recipe again I will use less dry ingredients and not roll in sugar before baking. I also wonder how this dough would work for cutouts? All in all this cookie isn't bad it's just not the fantastic cookie I was hoping for.",
