I mixed in mashed strawberries and frosted a chocolate cake with this frosting which might have made the difference from other people's results. For those of you who didn't like it: you might try adding berries (fresh or frozen) and also using the frosting on a different cake. Not all cakes do well with certain kinds of frosting even if they are dubbed \"versitle\" in terms of what you can frost them with. Also as with any recipe you need to be careful when preparing it. One little slip in the preperation can ruin the recipe in terms of what it is. Thank you!",

So we used unsweetened applesauce. Slightly more powdered sugar was used than the recipe calls for (for thickening purposes). Next with our safety being top priority we microwaved the uncooked egg mixture. The microwavezation also made the recipe frothier. A definite plus. Good luck this one is tricky to your tastebuds!",
