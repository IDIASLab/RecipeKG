First I brown the chicken on both sides (not cooking all the way through) and put that on top of the rice mixture along with the bread crumbs and cover with foil instead of putting the rice in by itself. After 25 minutes I take the foil off and cook the rest of the way. Also I use Italian flavored bread crumbs which kick it up a notch. The last thing is I substitute brown rice and you can hardly tell the difference. Very delicious recipe! Thank you!",
