I steamed the green beans just until they were bright green were slightly cooked but still had a \"snap.\" Then I added 1 tablespoon of regular balsamic and 1 tablespoon of white balsamic then seasoned salt (Tastefully Simple Brand) and fresh ground pepper. I also threw in some gorgonzola that I had on hand. I made this for a large group and several are demanding the recipe. Thanks!",

My green beans were from my garden and frozen in the freezer so I put them in a pot of water and boiled them for about 10 minutes just until tender then I drained them. I had almonds that I slivered and toasted in a pan...after toasting I set them aside and using the same pan I put in a TBSP or two of olive oil and then tossed in my green beans. I seasoned with salt and garlic pepper and tossed them a minute or two before adding in a couple splashes of basalmic vinegar (I only made enough green beans for two ppl). Then I served the beans and sprinkled the almonds on top. I will definately be making these again.",
