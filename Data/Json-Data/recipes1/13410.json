This recipe works with almost any kind of grahams you have on hand and it really dosen't have to be colored marshmallows. It's really up to you. I do suggest you don't chinze out and use cheap sweetened condensed milk because you'll have issues getting it to come together and for me it just dosen't taste the same. This is also good if you use half coconut/half chopped pecans to roll the log in OR add about a half cup to the marshmallow mixture.",
