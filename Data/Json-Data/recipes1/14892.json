Salt potatoes date to the 1800s, invented by local salt mine workers who created a simple and inexpensive lunch by boiling small potatoes in brine. The potatoes are still very popular today with the Central New York crowd, making an incredibly easy and delicious side dish.",

I think it should be noted for people (such as Aspiring Chef Rita) that the recipe calls for WHOLE potatoes, washed only... do not cut the potatoes up and do not peel them otherwise they will absorb the salt and become too salty.  When they are fork tender (about 15 minutes for me) drain them and let them sit to form the thin salt crust.  I sometimes add chives to my melted butter, just for some color and added flavor even though I know it is not traditional.  I have also boiled reds side by side, one pot with amount of salt this recipe calls for and one pot with just a little salt...and it's amazing how the salty brine makes the salt potatoes so creamy inside!  Made correctly, they are NOT salty... just creamy and delicious!  I served them alongside slow-roasted BBQ baby back pork ribs... mmmmmmmm... wonderful!",

I learned they were a big deal to people there, and I was eager to try the bag/kit of salt potatoes she picked up. The concept, she explained, was that the potatoes were boiled in copious amounts of salt that somehow made them flavorful and special. They were good, I thought, but tasted just like regular ol' boiled potatoes to me. In fact, they needed...salt! When I came across this recipe, I just had to try them again myself at home.  And once again I found them good, but tasting no different than regular ol' boiled potatoes - that needed...salt! ",

                "reviewBody": "first, i want to say thank you for the recipe. I've never measured in terms of cups, it's always been a quarter pound of salt to every pound of potatoes. For all the people saying that these are regular boiled potatoes, they are too salty, not salty enough, etc.. the purpose of the salt is not so much to make the potatoes salty as it is to lower the boiling point of the water. With the different boiling point, it makes the flesh of the potato creamier than normal boiling and less starchy. As for the saltiness/needs salt problem, you may need to adjust the amount of water that you use. It doesn't specify in the recipe, but for this amount of salt and potatoes, you need 3 quarts of water. If you aren't using enough, you might as well eat the salt shaker and skip the potatoes",

I stumbled upon an article on wikipedia about Syracuse Salt Potatoes and was absolutely enthralled with the story of Irish Salt Miners from the turn of the century. On Wikipedia, they had two recipe links. I followed THERE recipes and my family and I enjoyed a treat STRAIGHT FROM HEAVEN!!!! This is what I learned: 1) Use ONLY \"NEW yellow or white potatoes!!!\" Never-ever use red skin potatoes!!! 2) The ratio of salt to water is 1 cup of KOSHER SALT (never table salt) to 6 cups of water. 3) The salt must be completely dissolved IN the water before you put in the potatoes. 4) Boil them until tender, drain but DO NOT RINSE. Allow to cool until you can eat them and use melted butter to dip them into. I'm telling you, Syracuse Salt Potatoes will be served in our home from now on! :D",
