I don't believe anyone could tolerate let alone like guacamole prepared with this much salt! So strike one right off the bat. Second for my taste buds anyway one whole onion two jalapenos and one large tomato to two avocados is just simply off too! Could this possibly have been for maybe SIX avocados? The lime juice as well is probably twice the amount it should be for this many avocados. I did make guacamole with these ingredients but I salted to taste and added the other ingredients more in proportion to the two avocados. I also added a small clove of minced garlic. With significant changes in measurements this could be a great basic guacamole. If prepared as written however I don't know how anyone could eat it.",
