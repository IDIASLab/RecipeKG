I also mixed whole blackberries in to the creamed tofu and layered it with granola and raspberries. It was easy and quick. The end result looks like custard or yogurt and the vegans loved it. Me not being a vegan and not particularly a tofu fan I thought it tasted fine although the creamed tofu has a \"unique\" texture. My vegan friends said it was delicious and that they aren't used to eating dairy products so they can appreciate and enjoy the flavor of tofu. Hope this review helps you vegans and the people who love and cook for them. =)",

I found the tofu mixture a bit bland and then I remembered I had 1/2 container of peach flavoured cream cheese so added that and it really livened up the flavor. Instead of granola I added some graham cracker crumbs and voila...this was a mock cheesecake parfait and it was delicous!",

                "reviewBody": "Wow what a roller coaster ride for my taste buds! I made a few changes: I used 2 tablespoons of honey instead of 3 added 1/4 cup blueberries for the granola I just used toasted rolled oats (about 1/4 cup) and I added lots of cinnamon spice to my minced apple. What I did: I added about a dozen blueberries to the blender to add a hint of blue to the tofu. I put a layer of 1/2 the amount of tofu in a bowl. I used frozen raspberries and blueberries so I heated those on the stovetop until it started to turn into mush. I then put the raspberry/blueberry jam onto the tofu layer. I heated my minced apple/cinnamon spice mix for a couple of minutes over the stovetop and added this onto the raspberry/blueberry jam layer. Then I layered the rest of the tofu on top. I toasted some rolled oats mixed them with the raisins and sprinkled the mixture on top. It turned out super flavorful and exciting to eat with all the different ingredients and made a really pretty dessert. If you like sweet stuff use the whole 3 tablespoons of honey. I plan on making this again except next time I'll mix the raspberries with the tofu. Thanks for sharing!",
