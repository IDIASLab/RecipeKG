I baked in the oven at 350 degrees.  I crunch up a large piece of aluminum foil, then nest the acorn squash in the aluminum foil so they don't tip over.  Bake for about 1 hr.  Another variation I've heard is to use maple syrup with the butter instead of the brown sugar.  Anyway you make it, it is delicious.",
