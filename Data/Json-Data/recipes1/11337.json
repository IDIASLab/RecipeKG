The amount of butter, on the other hand, is more flexible and depends on how you intend to serve this dish. Since I used this as a main course served over linguine, a little extra butter was nice. So, if one was to prepare this exactly as written it probably would be very disappointing, and only worthy of a weak three stars. Having said that, however, since recipes are only guides anyway, it would be a shame to knock this down a star or two just because of measurements easily adjusted to taste. I didn't measure at all - just arranged the shrimp in a baking dish I had greased with olive oil.  Poured in just enough wine to basically cover the bottom of the dish, which I would guess was only a quarter of what was called for in the recipe.  I crushed some croutons for the bread crumbs, then mixed them with enough melted butter, parsley, and garlic to the consistency I wanted, just so that it looked kind of like a coarse, wet sand. I dribbled a little extra melted butter around the shrimp in the dish, baked for the recommended baking time, arranged it over the linguine, and let me tell you it was five star delicious!",

I used half the butter suggested melted it in a pan and then added in my fresh bread crumbs to saute a bit. Additional seasonings including an Italian blend helped to jazz up the crumbs. Because I love cooking with sherry and others had recommended it I used that in lieu of the white wine. I sprayed my casserole dish with PAM and only used a half cup if that of sherry. When the shrimp were just about done I turned on the broiler to brown and crisp up the topping. As I said everyone loved this dish and with these few changes it will certainly warrant a repeat performance. Thank you so much Jenne!",
