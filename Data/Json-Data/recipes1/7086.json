My sister had a problem (and to a lesser extent I did the first time) with the cookies becoming too thin but it was a matter of actually allowing the batter to sit for at least five minutes before spooning it onto the cookie sheet. The batter needs to congeal or something. As for the person who had problem estimating with the chocolate chips...each baking square is one ounce so if you have a 12 oz package of chocolate chips just use the whole bag.",

I had to let mine sit longer than stated probably 15 minutes. They are sensitive in the oven (mine were perfect in 12 minutes) and there is not a lot of wiggle room between not done and too done. My family really loved these so I will probably make them again but they do take some mollycoddling so only make them if you can commit to the recipe and to watching them closely. Thanks!!",

Let it rest for 10 minutes and it hardens up quite a bit... make sure to flatten them before you put them in the oven. The second time I made them I ran out of sugar so I used closer to 2/3 cup and I substituted chocolate chunks for the walnuts. They came out puffier and not as crackly but they did flatten out a bit after they cooled. I baked them for 14 minutes this time but I think 12 is enough. My coworkers thought these were fantastic! Great recipe:)",

I didn't have 12 squares of baker choc only had 8 so I cut the rcipe in half best I could except I didn't have walnuts so I put a sprinkling more of flour in the dough. I had to try this recipe even with all the mixed reviews my dough turned out perfect i think alot of the trick is to really fold in the flour mixture and let it set. Also be sure to use baker semi sweet squares and butter not margerine. Since I halved the recipe I used 1 large egg. The origianal recipe calls for 3 normal size eggs. I left the dough set at room temp 5 mins then stuck it in freezer for 5 more. I spooned the dough onto the greases/floured cookie sheet in 1\" balls trying not to touch the dough too much baked for 7 minutes....the cookies come out looking like the dough balls I put in..So those of you who got flat cookies must have done something wrong. My nexy batch I pressed the dough balls down a little...and they turned out perfect. these are perfect little fudgey brownie bites for your chocolate cravings!",
