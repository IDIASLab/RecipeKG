I had a bit of vegetable broth that I added while sauteing the vegetables and then when I added the tomato paste I needed to mix in some water. Even with the addition of liquid it still was a bit dry after baking. I think next time I'll use a can of Rotel with the juices instead of the tomato paste.

Didn't think it'd jive.\" For the flavors going into this I was skeptical about using Parmesan so I went with a Mexi-blend of shredded cheese instead. Halving the recipe (using black bean) made an ideal amount but it got a bit dry in the oven without having any moisture (diced tomatoes or tomato sauce maybe?) It tasted good and I was happy to use a pile of zucchini that my garden recently exploded with but I think next time I'll just let it warm in the skillet mixed together and just let cheese melt on top at serving. Oh and it was nummy to scoop it up with a blob of salsa onto a tortilla chip.",

OK I admit I made quite a few tweaks but I think I kept the 'essence' of the recipe the same. It turned out great! As written I think there is far too much chili powder especially considering the jalapeno (I used some roasted medium/hot hatch chilies which were great with a decent amount of kick). I used about 1.5 teaspoons of chili powder and 1.5 teaspoons of cumin which balanced with the other chilies was great for my taste preferences. I did need quite a bit of salt though. I used three zucchini which I would call 'average' size which equaled about 8 cups of chopped. I was a bit worried that this would make it a \"zucchini with a little bit of other stuff\" dish but the ratios actually turned out great. I also used two ears of fresh corn 4 cups of black beans (no kidney) yellow onion instead of green green instead of red pepper can of diced tomatoes instead of paste and shredded mex cheese because that's what I had on hand. I didn't bake it but served it up chili style with a dollop of sour cream and tortilla chips to dip. Mmm mmm good!",
