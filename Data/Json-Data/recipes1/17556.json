Doing that is a benefit to all whether your diabetic or not.  Gotta watch those carbs when your diabetic or not.  So I bought rolled oats (Bob's red mill) that contained many types of grains with flaxseed.  I use unsweetened coconut, there's no reason to use sweetened coconut, there was virtually no difference.  I add chia seeds (about 1/4 cup).  I also use a local honey.  I do use a crunchy peanut butter.  I also like adding more than a pinch of cinnamon.  Just gives it a little more depth.  These can be quite healthy and stretch out your energy when it dips as long as you can control how many you eat!!!  One last tip: mix the dry ingredients first, makes it all combine better.",

The only sight variation I made was to use vanilla nut extract instead of just vanilla and what a great taste! Highly recommended. I let them sit overnight and the flavor was even better. I think next time I will use unsweetened coconut to lower the sugar. Nice and chewy and packed with flavor. I will definitely make these again and again. These freeze well too!",
