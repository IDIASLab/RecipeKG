I have a hint to make it easier: measure the condensed milk in a microwave safe measuring cup. then put the remaining milk (it will be 1/4 cup) and the chocolate chips in the measuring cup warm in a microwave to melt the chocolate chips. It doesn't take long because of the high sugar content so watch it carefully.",

I doubled the amount of chocolate chips (that is 1/2 cup) and also added 1 tablespoon of butter to the chocolate mixture. It may be my imagination but when I measured out 8 oz of condensed milk (8oz = 1 cup) to add to the peanut butter chips there seemed like a LOT LESS than 6 oz of milk leftover (14oz can - 8oz = 6oz). But mathematically there should have been b/c I made no adjustments to the milk measurements. Good luck!",
