Maybe it's the charming simplicity of the preparation, or the childhood memories brought up by the tater-tots, but we found this concoction to be surprisingly scrumptious; it's got plenty of flavor, and a nice variation in textures.  I suppose it should be noted that we used ground turkey breast instead of ground beef, and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.",

The only thing I do differently is add cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom soup, a small container of cream cheese and a small container of sour cream.  I also bake the tots while the hamburger and onion are cooking because we like to have them a little crunchy, which may help cut down on some of the mushiness that other reviewers are mentioning.  Overall though, great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!",
