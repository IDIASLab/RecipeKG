I also tossed the broccoli in to cook with the pasta so it would be \"easier\" on the kids, skipped the zucchini, and topped off w/parmesan.",

I was about to throw it away but I didn't have anything else to feed my kids and stuck with it, hoping to make something of it. I upped the heat to medium and used a fork to stir it. after five mins of this it finally starting looking like alfredo sauce and after that it was easy. 4*",

A word of warning, do not let the pan you're using to melt the cream cheese get too hot. The cheese will imediately stick to the pan and turn into a paper like product. A note to Suzie who said she couldn't get the sauce to become smooth, I don't know why not. Once the milk is added to the cheese/butter it instantly smooths out. Just remember to keep stirring. This is a great recipe to experiment with. I didn't have any zuccini, but added some mushroom, onion and tomato to the sauce. I left out a small amount of the cream cheese and threw in a scoop of sour cream instead. It did need a lot more milk than called for. I just kept adding until I felt it was the right texture. Have fun with this you won't be dissapointed.",
