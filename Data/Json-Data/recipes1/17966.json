My only suggestion for improvement--go ahead and put the fig ON the bread with the cheese, instead of beside it.  The combination of the cheese+bread+fig+balsamic is absolutely wild.  Fresh mozzarella would also work nicely here.  The figs are what make it.",

The creaminess and flavor is great but I felt it over powered the figs' flavor and did not give enough compliment to the balsamic/ fig dynamic on the toast. I think I prefer a cheese with more sharp bite like a goat cheese or such.  This was good, just not quite perfection for me.",
