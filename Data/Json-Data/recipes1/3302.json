Despite the filling problem the flavor is exceptional. We used Honeycrisp apples which is astoundingly good. There is one major problem with the way this recipe is written: It's not clear if the apples are added prior to baking and baked as in a pie or added after as a topping like most cheesecake recipes. I didn't bake the apples and the recipe was still great but may have been better had they been baked (though that may have prevented the filling from being baked properly or on-time). With this issue addressed in the directions and with greater volume on the crust and filling this recipe is probably a \"5.\" FOLLOW UP: I made this a second time and increased the filling and crust. I also used the next largest spring-form pan and added one additional apple. With the additional ingredients I had to increase baking time to 50 minutes. My neice said this is in the top five of best foods SHE'S EVER HAD. It was (past tense) pretty good.",
