I could not find butter extract at the grocery store so I just left it out and added a little more vanilla and almond extract. I guess if you do have the butter extract this bread would be off the charts! I put lots of Pam in the bread pans and removed the bread after 5 minutes then poked holes and glazed. I would NEVER leave the bread in the pan then glaze! It will stick! Just pop it right out then take your time (like 5 minutes or so) and spoon the glaze over the bread over and over till it all sinks in. LOVE THIS! I will serve to my house full of guests on Thanksgiving morning! Oh one more thing...the glaze is an absolute must! Yes it is sweet..but it is a glaze afterall! This bread is awesome because of the glaze!",

I use the bread as a sping dessert I slice the bread and then put a dollop of lemon curd on it and top it with a strawberry. Yummy!",

A woman at work years ago gave me this same recipe, except for the glaze I use 1/4 cup orange juice, 3/4 cup regular granulated sugar and 1 1/2 tsp. each of the almond, butter and vanilla extracts.  I then heat the glaze mixture in the microwave for 1 minute to supersaturate it.  This makes a crusty glaze.  Everyone raves over it.  Thanks for submitting this for others to enjoy!  Makes a GREAT Holiday gift for neighbors and friends if you pour it into mini loaf pans and wrap them up.",
