I made a substitution of defrosted frozen MIXED vegetables for canned corn and that worked. I also had fat-free yogurt which is probably much thicker than the normal so the dough was thicker. And it was quite an enjoyable albeit plain loaf. I think the recipe may want more water but give it a go for something different.",
