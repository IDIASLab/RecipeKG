The sat out for a few days and were as moist and yummy as when i took then off thebaking sheet. Great recipe. I will be making these again.",

I LOVE PB so I added almost a full cup of unsalted chopped peanuts and used only 1 1/2 cups of the PB chips. I also added about 1/4 cup of honey. I wish I tried more because I couldn't really taste it. Even after that it was not too sweet which is the way I like them. I also prefer the lower cooking time - about 12 minutes. I did not feel the batter was crumbly but didn't care because I did not want to bother with shaping them and doing the criss-cross. I used an ice cream scoop only smooshed them down a tiny bit and I love how they retained their height and irregular shape that way. Absolutely my favorite PB cookies so far.",
