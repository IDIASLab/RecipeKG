The peas (which I crushed slightly) weren't very spicy once blended into the salad, but they provided a great crunch that contrasted nicely with the chewy cherries. I used Poppy Seed Dressing II, from this site, and it was a perfect complement. This is so easy and delicious, I'll be making it often. (UPDATE: It doesn't make the best leftovers; the peas get way too soft. Best eaten fresh.)",
