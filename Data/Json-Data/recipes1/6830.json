Served with some Chardonney and fresh tomatoes.  \n\nEnjoy!  My kids and husband sure did.  I only wish I would have made an extra one at same time to have for salads, quesadillas, etc. this week.",

I added the rosemary and onion, but then also rubbed the bird with olive oil, a lot of salt, and the juice from one lemon.  The lemon halves then went inside with the rosemary and onion and I added a clove of garlic (will add more next time).  I poured a cup of water over it and roasted it for 2 1/2 hours at 300 and it was amazing.  It was my first time ever cooking a whole chicken and everyone was super impressed.  Best to keep the drippings as thats where most of the flavor is.  Amazing once poured over top of the meat.",

After reading the reviews, I did the following: brined the chicken beforehand (you can find information on that under allrecipes advice), stuffed the cavity with an onion, some rosemary, several cloves of garlic, and two lemon halves (i reserved the juice to pour over the chicken).  I put the chicken on top of a bed of veggies (potatoes, carrots, brussel sprouts), seasoned with salt, pepper, and the reserved lemon juice, and drizzled it with a little olive oil.  I poured a little water into the pan, popped it in for 2.5 hours at 350 degrees.  I made three at once yesterday night for guests - I literally had people standing over the carcasses to pick off microscopic pieces of chicken.  Great recipe.",

When I roast chickens I always make 2 (for leftvoer recipes)and the recipe doubled very nicely.  After dinner we removed all the meat and put the 2 carcasses in a pot and made stock.  If you do this....try to remove as much rosemary as possible before adding carcasses.  The rosemary can be very overpowering!  I made a couple of dishes using the meat and stock as leftovers and they were very tasty.  Another time I made this I used cut up chicken and simply sprinkled the rosemary over and chopped the onion and added it all to a big baking dish, with some chopped garlic and about a cup of stock.  I covered and baked for about 30 minutes at 350 then uncovered and finished baking for about 30 mintues until done...YUM!",

                "reviewBody": "USE A MEAT THERMOMETER!\nI followed the 20 minute/pound advice of several reveiwers, and did NOT cook my 3-lb chicken 2 to 2-1/2 hours as the original recipe recommended.  Was I ever sorry!  It looked beautiful, but was terribly underdone... red meat at the inner thighs.  (I did use 2 oven thermometers like I always do to insure I had the oven temperature at 350.  I wiggled the leg and the juices ran clear).  BUT I should have used a MEAT thermometer to check the inner thigh temperature- the USDA says to cook chicken to an internal temp of 165 degrees.  (I also found several resources that said an unstuffed chicken takes 20-30 minutes per pound, and a stuffed chicken needs more cooking time than an unstuffed one.)",
