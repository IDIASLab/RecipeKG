The only thing I changed was the mayo before the bread crym mixture......the mayo didn't appeal to me (seemed too thick and gloppy) so i made a mix of half mayo and half milk whisked together.  I dipped the chicken into that first and then into the bread crumbs.  My husband said it was better than fried, and he is PICKY about his chicken.  The chicken was extremely moist and I was pleasantly surprised.  My kids LOVED it and I will definately make it again!!",

I also thinned the mayo a bit like others did I used some Hidden Valley light Ranch dressing (I used lite mayo). I made this with a jumbo pack of thighs that I skinned and there were only three left. I served it with biscuits and country gravy. Yum!\n\nEdit: I forgot to state that I cooked the chicken on a large cookie cooling rack that was placed on a baking sheet pan. This allows the hot air to get to the bottom of the chicken and you wont get soggy bottoms.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a delicious recipe but I made a few changes the second time that made it better.  Instead of breadcrumbs, I used Panko breading which in can get in Asian food markets quite easily.  Panko is usually used for tempura coating and gives the chicken a better taste and crunch.  The thyme was also too strong so I used some poultry seasoning and Old Bay seasoning to add some spice.  Also, the cooking temp. was better at 375 degrees, which cooked the chicken quicker and left it more moist.  I usually like skin-on, but with the mayo coating, leaving the skin on made it a bit too greasy so the second time I took all the skin off and it tasted great.  Don't overdo the mayo coating or it could get to greasy or make the bread coating soggy in some spots.  My toddler and husband loved it.  This one is a keeper.",

When I was getting ready to put this in the oven, I saw on the back of the bread crumb package a recipe similar to this and it stated to cook at 425 degrees for 40 minutes, so I cooked the chicken at 400 degrees for 20 minutes per side and it was very crispy and the chicken was so moist and tender, almost falling apart.

I read mayonaise and thought \"That's crazy\", then I read some of the positive reviews regarding the mayo and thought those people were crazy too but hey, I AM CRAZY!!!  What a wonderful recipe.  My only substitutions due to not having them around were soda crackers crushed up instead of bread crumbs and miracle whip instead of mayonaise.  1/2 a cup of mayo is definately enough.  Juicy, tender chicken (even the white meat!) with a great flavor.  I absolutely LOVED this recipe.  We had guests over for supper and all I kept hearing from him and my husband was \"Mmmm, this is really good.\"  Words are not enough, good-bye shake'n bake, hello oven fried chicken...  this will definately become a regular in my house!!!",

I added a little cornmeal to the bread crumb mix as well as a bit of onion powder. No matter what mix of spices you use it's all a matter of personal taste. Whenever I do regular fried chicken I always use buttermilk, so to coat the chicken I used 1/2 cup of Hellman's lite mayo and thinned that out with buttermilk. I dipped that and then the chicken into the bread crumb mixture vs. shaking it in a bag. I let it set until the coating became a little \"pasty\" in nature. I sprayed the bottom of a baking dish with Pam so nothing would stick. I baked it for 25 minutes then turned it and baked it for the remainder of the time. I would advise against turning it any more than that or the coating will come off. This turned out very moist and juicy!",
