I used only 3 boneless skinless breasts (whole) as we don't really care for leftover chicken, and threw them right in there frozen as I've heard other reviewers say they've done this and I wanted to try for those days when I forget to thaw.  It was cooked to perfection, fork tender and juicy in approx 7 hours.  How wonderful!  I used whole fresh mushrooms since they're easier to pick out (hate em!) and sliced the onion into rings for those who don't like them.  I am big on garlic so I added about 4 big cloves, chopped, and also added some Italian seasoning and basil.  1/4 cup of wine, a can of diced tomatoes (flavored) and a can of tomato paste and voila!  excellent, excellent chicken.  My hubby requested I make extra sauce for dipping and such.  Will make again and again!",

The flavor just isn't there, but then again, that's only my opinion. I used bone-in pieces of chicken, which I browned in a skillet first and added the flavorful browned bits to the crock pot. The whole family was very happy with this tasty recipe. Thank you.",

I would recommend using half the sauce it calls for in the beginning. Then towards the end you can add more if needed, that way it's not too runny. Also, I added the mushrooms about 15 minutes before it was done, then they aren't mushy, just perfect. Another suggestion is to always just saute the mushrooms, onions and garlic (even bell peppers if desired) in olive oil and then top the chicken and sauce with it. Yummy dish, will make again.",

I followed a variety of reviews and used frozen, boneless, skinless chicken thighs, went heavy handed on some oregano sprinkles, added in a few shakes of onion flakes, red pepper flakes, garlic powder and a couple heaping spoonfuls of minced garlic from the jar.  I used a tomato basil spaghetti sauce along with a can of tomato paste.  Used 1/2 of a large green bell pepper (diced), 1/2 of a small yellow onion (diced).  I started this all at 6 hours.  An hour before dinner time, I added in sliced mushrooms and chopped up a zucchini, threw that in and left the lid off the final 20 minutes and my sauce thickened up very nicely.  Seriously, this was so delicious.  Served over angel hair pasta, some fresh steamed green beans on the side and a slice of garlic bread.  I'm more excited about the left-overs for lunch tomorrow!",
