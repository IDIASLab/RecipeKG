I did alter it a bit...I took reviewers advice for more topping and added 1/2 cup more flour 1/2 cup brown sugar and a few tablespoons more butter to the crumb topping and it was perfect! I also threw in about a cup of rhubarb I had in my freezer and some cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg on top of the apple/rhubarb mixture. I used very tart apples and that along with the rhubarb made the amount of sugar in the topping and the gelatin balance out just right. Threw some whipped topping on top and it went up so quick my husband didn't even get any! I definitely will make this again and very soon. Oh yes I only had one small package of strawberry Kiwi Jello and one small package of Strawberry banana Jello. I was worried about that but you couldn't tell. Most people thought it was all strawberries and rhubarb. They didn't even know it was apples!",

Just a note, don't attempt to drizzle any form of icing over it (even if for show) because the crust is extremely sweet.  I tried doing a light drizzle, and it made the sugar levels unbearable.\r\n\r\nMy roommate enjoys it when I serve it hot with icecream on top.  (When I do this, I usually make a little extra crumble topping to put on the \"Stuff\", just to make it hold the ice cream on top better).  My beau on the other hand likes it chilled.  I'm more of a room-temperature person myself, but it takes quite good all three ways.\r\n\r\nI've tried other forms of jello flavors that are complementary to apples, but have found strawberry to taste the best.  Its a little more obvious with the other ones that the fruit is not really in there, but I've had dinner-guests gasp in disbelief when I told them that there were no actual strawberries in this recipe.\r\n\r\nThe hardest part to this recipe is preparing the apples.  Everything else is so easy that my cooking-impaired beau was able to make it.\r\n\r\nIt is fun for kids to help make as well, as they get to sprinkle the jello on top, as well as the topping.",

As well I split the sugar into 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Both of those were on the advice of other reviewers. Also FYI I used slightly tart yellow apples. And i left the peel on.",
