This recipe yielded a 12\" \"cake\" and 20 extra cookies. The cookie \"cake\" was perfectly cooked in 20 minutes. Thanks for the delicious recipe. January 28 2010: I made this again using a 17.25'x11.5'x1' cookie sheet/jelly roll pan and it came out great. I used parchment paper instead of greasing the pan. Cooking time remained the same at 22 minutes.",

I don't know why people are saying they taste funny - they taste like whats in them - oatmeal choc chip cookies! I recommend baking them 12 minutes (although I am high altitude) and letting them cool for at least 5 minutes on the pan before removing them. I took my first batch out after 10 minutes and the cookies still had a big raw looking mound in the middle. After tasting both once they cooled I thought the texture and flavor was much better when cooked 12 min.",
