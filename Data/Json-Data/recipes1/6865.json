I left out the bacon and mushrooms and all of the spices. I used 4 cups of broth and 1 cup of water (broth comes in a 4 cup container) and added 2 cans of cream of whatever soup to add a bit of creaminess. For spices I subbed in 4 T of curry powder which gave it a great spiceyness. I used leftover chicken whatever I had on hand. Then I chopped the veggies I had in the fridge and sauted them with the onions before mixing it all together. A mixing tip mix the soup with the veggies and then stir into the broth and barely - makes the entire process go better. Topped with shreeded soy cheese... It took 1 hour 20 minutes to bake but my oven tends to be slow. Over all a great idea of a recipe that seems easily modifiable into whatever you happen to have on hand! We will definitly make this again.",

I omitted the crushed bay leaves and bacon and used olive oil to sautee the veggies. I used boneless chicken breasts instead of dark meat. If I make this again I might add in 1/2 can (or a whole can) of creamy soup (crm of mushroom maybe?) to make the dish a little creamy. Great as leftovers. I sprinkled some crumbled blue cheese on the leftovers and it was really yummy!",

I doubled the marjoram and parsley and halved the thyme (don't like thyme much). 4. I salted/peppered the chicken breasts and sprinkled extra marjoram on top of them.
