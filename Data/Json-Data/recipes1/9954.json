                "reviewBody": "OK the recipe itself is good but I fiddled with it and came up with a delicious quiche-like pie. Here's what to do. I beat three eggs omitted the second pie shell and the nutmeg (too spicy-sweet and a strange contrast with the spinach and cheese) cut the cheeses by about 1/3 added sauteed onions and sauteed mushrooms in low-cal butter and it rocked! (Mix sauteed veggies with beaten eggs.) I suppose making it into a quiche defeats the purpose of calling it a pie but really you will save on calories and stress and the mushrooms and onions give it such flavor. Oh yes and I used part-skim mozzarella with the parmesan and ricotta both of which I cut which I said already. The mozzarella melds with the spinach and mushroom flavors and of course gives that lovely long cheesy-string effect while eating. Add salt to taste because the onions do give extra flavor as does the cheese. Anyway with the adjustments it was yummy but I can't give it 5 stars since I made so many adjustments. A good starting place from which to experiment.",
