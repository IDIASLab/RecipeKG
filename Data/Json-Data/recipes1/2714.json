Next time I will probably split the dough between two loaves and spread each thinner; as one loaf it was a bit thick for the rice center. Take note that if you intend to change the number of servings the original measures are in the body of the recipe. I cut the recipe in half but then started following the measures within the directions of the recipe. I realized pretty early on and and was able to recover. Thanks for a new and yummy treat!",
