Served it all with rich gravy and...viola! Sunday roast to die for. Sadly though not a scrap leftover for sandwiches!",

We use English mustard powder ground rock salt and five-corn pepper to dust the fat surface before roasting. When roasting it's a good idea to get rid of the metal rack and replace it with various washed peeled (or unpeeled) halved vegetables: potatoes parsnips carrots turnips will do. Just enough to raise the meat from the bottom of the roasting pan. This adds flavour and stops the meat drying out. These are not intended to be served at table although uses can be found for them. Remember also to steam potatoes until a knife begins to go in easily then set them aside to cool awhile. Then roast them in pre-heated beef dripping.",

Mix before pouring in a deep cup tin that has been smoking in a really hot oven - about 450 degrees.. the fat MUST be that hot.. then cook for 20 minutes and whatever you do, don't open the oven door while they bake!",

It didn't make any drippings so I used butter for the yorkshire puddings. I had to use a different cut of beef (bottom round if I remember correctly) and there wasn't a lot of fat on it so I'm sure that had something to do with the meat being so dry and there being no drippings. The yorkshire puddings were exactly how I remember them from childhood when my mom used to make them though and they were just great. I'll make those again though probably with a different main course. I served this with \"Mushy Peas I\" from this site and dinner was fantastic.",
