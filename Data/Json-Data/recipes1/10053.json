                "reviewBody": "I have made these twice and so far I think it would be safe to say that they are nothing short of wonderful! \r\n   I do have a few modifications of my own. I made the dough in my bread machine on \"dough\" cycle. I add a little bit of vanilla into the dough for those of us who choose not to have frosting. ( I think cream chese frosting would also be very tasty) I sprinkle a little olive oil on the dough before adding the filling. I also find that when rolling into the log, the more times you can roll it the better the buns come. I think that thats the true trick to making these. They will have more filling and stay more moist. So put a little extra effort into rolling it into a log and they come out doubly better! And to make them SUPER moist put a VERY small pat pf butter on top of each roll before baking.\r\n   One more thing- when i made these the second time, when I tool these out of the fridge in the morning I found that some of the filling had liquified and there were little puddles of it around each bun. If this is the case try to scoop this up and put it on the buns BEFORE cooking them! If you do it after it will carmalize into a rock hard tooth-breaker. And to top my review off- baking them for 20 minutes makes for a much better out come!\r\n   Once again- Perfect!",

I particularly enjoyed checking on them in the morning and seeing how plump and delicious-smelling they had become overnight.  I also like the fact there are no weird or expensive ingredients.  I'll use a little bigger pan next time because they were a bit overcrowded, and I'll add just a little more brown sugar & cinnamon.  Be careful not to let them overheat during rising or they will stop rising too soon and be like little hockey pucks.",

The dough comes out extremely dense for a cinnamon roll - I even cut back by almost a full 1/2 cup and, while the rolls rose in the oven, they were still quite heavy.\n\n2. The filling was terribly dry - I think this could have been influenced by the consistency of the dough, but while the lack of any kind of fat (i.e. butter) in the filling may make these a little healthier there was nothing to allow the cinnamon/brown sugar mix to properly melt and give that gooey consistency you tend to crave in a cinnamon roll! (Besides, who's going for healthy in a cinnamon roll anyways?)  \n\n3. The icing needs some major work - this is little more than a basic sugary glaze. Combined with the sand-like brown sugar/cinnamon filling which dissolved into pure sugar in your mouth, this topping was the sugary straw that broke the camels back and simply overpowered the entire recipe.\n\nI was interested to try a new recipe, but know now that I'll stick with my original cinnamon roll recipe  - \"Clone of a Cinnabon\" - also from Allrecipes",
