My only comment - my stepmother is Swiss and she lets the bread rise for 30 mins before plaiting, and then lets it rise a further 30 mins after plaiting.  This doesn't add anything to the taste but it makes it look prettier!  I think it does help the texture; however - it's more open and softer. She has had difficulty in the UK and in NZ with finding correct flour (in Switzerland you can buy special zopf flour).  She suggests using a strong white flour.   One reviewer has suggested brushing with butter rather than the egg yolk and water mix.  I personally wouldn't recommend this - the egg yolk mix gives a beautiful golden shine to the bread that is very attractive and butter doesn't have the same effect at all. It definitely DOES need salt, but not sugar!  ",

This would be good to dip into flavored olive oil or toast with honey or jam. But as a bread itself the taste is lacking and flavorless. Process: I used my bread machine putting in the milk egg & butter followed by flour and yeast. I rose once in my machine. Then I took it out braided it and left it out for about 45 minutes (covered with a wet cloth) to rise (and it rose a lot so I recommend a second rise). cooked about 20 minutes. Very light bread.- (If) Next-time alterations: add 3/4 teaspoon salt (a must) 1 tsp sugar.",
