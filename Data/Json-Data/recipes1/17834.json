One of the things that I did different: After I removed all of the skin and the meat after the roasting time of the chicken - I roasted the bones and the veggies from the pot (I added more onions, carrot and celery) on an oiled baking sheet and baked them at 400\u00b0F for ~ 30 minutes so to extract a richer flavor from the bones and the veggies. I followed the remainder of the recipe except I substituted a large dried bay leaf in place of the thyme, added some fresh celery leafs from a celery bunch and black peppercorns after all of the foam and fat had been skimmed off. I never omit bay leafs, celery leafs or peppercorns when I make a broth/stock. I was leery of using ketchup in a broth but I used the Hunts\u00ae brand of ketchup because it doesn\u2019t have any high fructose corn syrup in it. Note: I wash off the dirt but I never pare carrots nor peel the outside skin off of onions for making broth/stock because I strive for all of the natural flavor and color that I can get into a broth/stock. After all, the broth is strained well and the bones seasonings and veggies are discarded at the end. The end result was perfect for my tastes and the ketchup added a surprisingly nice touch of flavor to the broth.",

The printed recipe doesn't include the 8 peppercorns that he uses in the video.\n3. Don't scrimp too much on the time.  12 hours is good but 10 hours is okay as well.  Don't go too much below that.\n4. Don't stir it. You'll make it cloudy.  Leave it alone.  It will be fine.\n5. Pour it out slowly and carefully.  Don't ladle it out.  Don't try to drain out that last bit with the chicken crumbs in it.\n6.  If you want that beautiful red color use yellow onions.  Use the ones with the rust colored skin.\n7.  Don't fret over \"backs and necks\".  Use what chicken bones that you have. When whole chickens are on sale I get a couple, break them down and use the whole carcass for my broth.  I like to debone the thighs so I throw those bones in as well.  wing tips or whole wings are fine too.\n8. Skim the scum, skim the scum, skim the scum.\n9. It lasts for months in the freezer.",

The 5th star would have been given if Chef John had done as I do and added 4 chicken feet to the mix for more collagen and nutrition. Thanks John I always read your recipes.",
