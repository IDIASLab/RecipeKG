I took the suggestions of some of the reviewers by cutting back on the bread crumbs to 1/2cup. Used 3/4 cup of cheese and cut the salt to 1/4 tsp. Also used 2 eggs yolks and Italian style bread crumbs and 2lbs. of boneless, skinless chicken. We are a family of 4 and the chicken disappeared very quickly with requests to make it again soon!\r\nThank you Amy!",

I also used 2 egg yolks and 2 tsp. of minced garlic (equiv. to 4 garlic cloves).  I put yolks and garlic in large ziploc bag, then added chicken to bag.  Mixed it all up and put in fridge for about 7 hours.  Also, I only used half of the bread crumbs for the dry mix.  After I had all of the chicken coated, I sprinkled a little more parmesean cheese on top.  Since I used tenders, I cooked it for 20 minutes at 400.  Very juicy and wonderful.

Who ever gave this recipe a poor rating must have done something really wrong. 6 cloves of garlic was perfect but one egg yolk wasn't enough for me. I cooked 5 pieces of chicken so I mixed 3 egg yolks with 6 cloves and garlic and that was plenty to marinate the chicken. There really wasn't much egg yolk mixture left after marinating overnight so I couldn't get the bread crumbs to stick that well but it was still fabulous! I cut the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese in half and still had plenty. I used the whole tablespoon of parsley but I changed up the rest of the spices a little. I used one tablespoon total with a little of all these spices: garlic salt garlic powder garlic and herb seasoning cayenne pepper red pepper and ground black pepper. This tasted perfect to me. I think that you can pretty much salt and season this dish according to your own particular taste.",

I like to cut the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces before marinating. After a mere 4 hours in the egg/garlic mixture the chicken is SO tender and the bite-sized pieces are perfect for my kids. Also noteworthy is that the dish can be a bit salty if you add the recommended salt use salted butter and seasoned breadcrumbs. We prefer it with no salt added unsalted butter and unseasoned bread crumbs. Great with an Italian themed dinner (ie pasta with tomato sauce salad and garlic bread).",
