I will say that unlike others I did not find this difficult or time consuming at all--I thought it was super easy with two little ones underfoot no less! However I thought it was bland and needed to be perked up. My other comment is that the recipe says it makes two pies. I followed the recipe exactly and there did not seem to be enough filling for two; we ended up with two flat pies.",

You should see his eyes light up when he discovers me preparing it - and he is a very finicky weight concious person!

The night before I mix all the ingredients together. Then I just have to pour it into the pie shell and bake it for brunch! I also leave off the top crust. It simply isn't necessary and a look at the mixed ingredients peaks my guests' interest. Smells so good!",
