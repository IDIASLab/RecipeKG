We also agree that THIS seasoning mix is even better.  Always mindful of Hubs' sensitive innards I reduced the cayenne by half, leaving all else the same.  We used it to blacken grouper in a cast iron pan on our outdoor grill - just out of this world. All the seasonings blend cooperatively with each other to create a whole new taste - in other words, no one spice stands out. And for us, cutting the cayenne by half was just right. Great recipe.",

I buttered one side of the Prime Rib, diped both sides in the rub, heated my iron skillet for 10 minutes on High, and blackened the meat  buttered-side first for about a minute and then flipped it over. Of course, my kitchen filled up with smoke, but a quick blast with the attic fan took care of that. I cut a baguette in half lengthwise, then into thirds (for 3 sandwiches),  toasted each one, added some provolone cheese, sauteed onions and italian dressing. Mmmm.",
