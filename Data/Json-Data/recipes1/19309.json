The tangy goat cheese and spicy-sweet mango chutney is an awesome combo, and sourdough bread lends to the flavor nicely. As a bonus, it is ridiculously quick and easy to make! Try pairing this with butternut squash soup; it's an even better combo than the old grilled cheese and tomato!",

I actually had 2 for lunch today This simple recipe also works really well using extra-old or sharp white cheddar sandwiched between slices of homemade sourdough. I like adding some finely minced South East Asian type chilis as well small the red or green ones. I used to use store-bought mango chutney but now use my own that I've canned which makes this sandwich even better.",
