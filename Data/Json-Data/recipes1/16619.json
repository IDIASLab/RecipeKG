I increased it to 1/2 t. and will do more next time.  3/4 or 1 teaspoon seems about right. Other than that I made it as directed and it came out fine. My oven seems a bit slow so I did 310' and it was perfect right at the 90 minute mark. I did use coconut oil with unsalted butter in the frosting and it is superb.  If I can next time I would like to bake it a couple days ahead and let it develop its best flavor before frosting and serving.  Thank you for sharing this gem!",

It made a perfect Easter cake which I brought to my family gathering and everyone loved it. I had to bake it about 20 minutes longer because the batter was still gooey inside after the 90 minutes. The only actual problem I had was that my cake stuck to the pan and so the outer crust didn't look very pretty when I got it out. I just completely covered it with frosting and no one new the difference but I think the recipe needs to include flouring the bundt pan. I'm assuming that was my problem since I didn't do that. I'll keep this recipe for the future and I've already passed it onto my mom.",

I loved it and did my office. The cake is moist and flavorful. I did add a tsp of coconut extract to the batter and frosting (decreased vanilla in icing to 1 tsp) to ramp up the flavor of coconut. The icing whips up light and fluffy. It's the perfect contrast to the sweetness of the cake. Will bake it again.",

                "reviewBody": "Except for using plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream (it was what I had on hand) and 1/4 tsp salt in the frosting to cut sweetness, I completely followed the recipe.  I was surprised how much the cake rose, though at my house it took 2 full hours. It didn't fall after I took it out of the oven like a cake sometimes will.  \nI loved the consistency of the frosting, I thought a long time against using solid Crisco and using butter instead (will use all butter next time), but used the shortening after all.  \nI tried to stick the coconut on the sides of the cake, like with a butter cream, it didn't stick as well, so I would put the coconut on top next time.\nMy family enjoyed the cake, my husband loved it; to me it was very heavy.  It reminded me of muffin texture and there was an under-taste  I can't figure out.   Don't get me wrong, it was very good, I would make it again, maybe topped with fresh strawberries or other fresh fruit.  \nThis cake is hearty and will travel well, I plan to take it to a pot luck affair in July. Maybe I'll frost it on-site.\nI am an experienced baker, if you are a patient newby, you can do it, but this was a time-consuming recipe and might be overwhelming to try without confidence.  Using a mixer is your best bet.",

Followed the recipe without any changes. Not sure what went wrong but it was awful. Not only was it too dense but it was also dry. Won't make again. Loved the icing though and will use it again.",
