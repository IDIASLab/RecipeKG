The trick to not having greasy frosting is to whip the crisco and butter for at least 20 mins or until it is light and fluffy.  I also added additional vanilla flavor and almond flavor for a richer taste.  My recipe was modified to cover a cake that would serve 40 people. I had nothing but continous compliments and serveral request to make more cakes.  Thanks Jeannie",

I went with other suggestions to use less sugar (6 cups was best for our taste). This was so easy to make and it had wonderful buttercream flavor! Had enough to add raspberry glaze to it and made a raspberry buttercream filling for the French Vanilla anniversary cake. Was great for piping decorations and borders also. Highly recommended for those looking for a GREAT buttercream frosting!",

I took other reviewers advice and whipped the butter and shortening for 10 minutes, and it had none of the greasy taste of shortening.  Also, if you use the butter flavored Crisco, the frosting will turn out very yellow-unsuitable for a wedding cake. I stopped at 4 cups of sugar for the main icing and then added one cup to the remining frosting for the piping.  It tasted great, looked professional, and held up well at an outdoor wedding.  If I even find myself doing another wedding cake (heaven forbid), I will use this recipe again.",

I was worried when mixing it up that it would be too soft for piping but it was fine. Note that this will yield more of an ivory frosting due to the butter you won't get a pure white frosting. I definitely prefer the flavor of this frosting using butter as opposed to frosting in the Rick's Buttercream. I will use this one when I don't need it to be pure white.",

I didn't use all the sugar that the recipe called for because when I got to 6 cups I stopped and did a taste test, perfect for my taste(20 servings).
