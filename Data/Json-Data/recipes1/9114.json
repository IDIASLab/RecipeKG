Overall I thought this was a great recipe! A REAL recipe for fudge without all the marshmallow creme junk. A wonderful peanut butter taste! I was impressed! The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the fudge seemed a bit too moist and soft for my taste. It was still firm but I think it could be improved. I will try this recipe again but I will probably wait at least 10 minutes before adding the peanut butter and vanilla. Highly recommended! I will be trying",

I use a probe electronic thermometer when I make fudge and it works much better than the 3 dollar candy thermometers. Exact temerpatures you can read everytime. Good Luck!",
