It is just the right touch for a great St. Patrick's Day Meal. We had friends over and everyone raved over the meal - this will definitely be made year-round not just for St. Pat's Day. Timesaver Tip: I ended up slowcooking this in my crockpot during the day instead of on the stove and ended up with very tender meat and plenty of free time to run errands during the day instead of watching the stove. Right before my guests arrived I baked the glazed brisket and made the lentils on the stove. So tasty and so easy!",

My roast was pre marinaded in the pickling spices so I omitted them and just dumped the juices from the meat into the pot. I also couldn't resist adding cabbage to the pot because I love corned beef and cabbage. I figured I'd add it to the lentils later (which I didn't end up doing I just ate the yummy cabbage!). My lentils are STILL cooking as I type. I used the brown kind since that's what was at my grocery store but different kinds of lentils cook up differently so I don't know what would be best. I also had to add ALL the broth to my ONE CUP of lentils-which makes a TON! I included the carrot and some of the onion to my lentils and then mashed it in. The lentils taste great but they're taking a real long time to cook. I will make this again but I'll try and tweak the cooking times so I have a moist roast. This was also my first time making corned beef so I'm giving some credit to the recipe since I'm inexperienced.",
