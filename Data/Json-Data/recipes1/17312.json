Now I can make my own and tweak it as I want, more sweet or less, crunchy or creamy.",

                "reviewBody": "I wanted to make my own peanut butter. I bought 2 pounds of peanuts at the farmers market. Yes this recipe is easy in principal but in the real world (with kids dogs chores etc) this project is completely cumbersome. Roasting the nut in its shell is very simple. However shelling the nuts takes a long time and then pulling off that purplish thin inner skin that wraps the actual nut is a pain in the rear end. Finally it has to be made in very small batches in a food processor because it's not a lot of space. The nuts kept getting jammed under the blade of the food processor. The consistency is really thick so I ended up putting in too much peanut oil. It tasted awful. I'm sure most of it was \"first time\" mistakes...but overall the cost wasn't any cheaper and it certainly took too long. I would rather just get the organic peanut butter at the store and save myself some time!!",

                "reviewBody": "I saw this recipe today, but made essentially the same thing yesterday, using half the ingredients, thinking I was being original. I started with a 16 oz. jar of dry roasted peanuts - no salt or sugar added, saving all the roasting and shelling bother. I Cuisinart-ed them until reasonably smooth, maybe 3 minutes of pulsing. It starts forming a ball. It was a little thick, so I added a bit of oil. The obvious oil would have been peanut, but I had none, so used 1 tsp.of olive oil. It all emulsified pretty well - it's been overnight in the fridge, and it still hasn't separated. This project started because I had a recipe calling for peanut butter for a sauce, and I only had crunchy, so decided to make my own smooth butter. Make this to a smooth consistency, then add more peanuts and pulse a bit, and you have crunchy.\nYes, the texture was a bit like wet sand, or a coarse paste, but that gives you characteristics of both smooth and crunchy. Add a touch more oil to thin it out. Had I ground it longer, I'm sure it would have gotten smoother. Or ground a separate batch of peanuts more coarsely, then stirred them into the smooth stuff for crunchy. No salt, no sweetener,no hydrogenated stuff (Bad for you!),just PURE peanut butter. How much more healthful can you get?",
