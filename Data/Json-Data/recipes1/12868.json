I made it even more special by adding the peppercorn spice packet that was packaged with the brisket I used (actually, I think it would have been very bland without it).  My brisket was only 3 lbs., so I cooked it only 3 hours.  You will know it's ready when you insert a fork, the meat comes up easily.  I used fewer ingredients (added the last 20-30 minutes of cooking):  1 onion, about 15 baby carrots, 10 new potatoes (cut in wedges), and only 1 head of cabbage.  I served it with 'Irresistible Irish Soda Bread' from this site.  The 2nd time I made this, I used a slow cooker.  Put the meat, seasoning packet on top of it, onion wedges, and poured in 1/2 cup water.  Cooked on low for 6 hours.  Took the meat out (leaving the onions and broth), added the potatoes (cut in wedges), then carrots, then cabbage, and cooked on high for 3 hours.  Perfect!  Wow, what a great Irish meal!  Thanks for the recipe!",

When I put the meat into a storage container, I ladeled about an inch of cooking liquid into the container, to keep the meat moist, which worked beautifully.  I had a smaller piece of corned beef, so I decreased the cooking time some, and only used 1 head of cabbage.  Based on the way everything cooked I would put the potatoes under the cabbage.  Then they, too, would have that wonderful corned beef flavor.  I was feeling sort of homesick for this dinner, so I am grateful to have found the recipe.",
