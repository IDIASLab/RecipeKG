But I seem to remember an amount of time to boil the glaze like maybe 5 minutes? If you're finding the dough too sticky it's probably because you're using a mixer. That makes a softer dough for some reason. I boil the honey/molasses mixture in a medium sized saucepan then add the other ingredients and stir by hand--finishing up WITH my hands since it's too stiff for me to finish up stirring. I refrigerate in 4 disks wrapped in plastic wrap. After that I dust the dough with flour on each side roll a bit dust again and repeat if needed. No sticky problems! I found that 9 minutes was just right in my oven. For best flavor and texture you'll need to put the cookies in a sealed container with a slice of apple or orange for a month or so changing the fruit every few days. They'll become soft and chewy with a marvelously complex spicy fruity flavor!",

The only thing that I changed was that I used a bit more citron and nuts than was called for and I used chopped pecans. Before baking I pressed a pecan half into the center of each cookie. Also I used a lemon glaze - something that I think is necessary. To make juice one lemon and add enough powdered sugar to make somewhat thick. Spread on when cookies are still hot from oven. In terms of stickiness this dough is quite sticky but it is definitely manageable. Make sure you chill it overnight and do not add a lot of flour into the dough as you roll. Before placing the cookies on the sheets I blew off any and all flour I could. The cookies turned out great; I have the last sheet in the oven now...",

These taste good and for taste I would give this probably 4-4.5 stars but the consistency is all wrong - MUCH too crisp and hard unlike what Lebkuchen is supposed to be which is almost cakey. The directions to roll these to 1/4\" is not right - if you roll to 1/2-3/4\" they turn out a lot better. I would also bake these a little less than called for these turned out much too hard. Better for cutting out gingerbread men or building a gingerbread house out of. The glaze also wasn't right - much too gloopy and sticky I ended up only doing the first batch and then throwing out the rest of the glaze - they are good plain or I might add some melted chocolate. I used the Back-Oblaten someone mentioned - the edible paper wafers as a base. I didn't have the problem with stickiness everyone else had if anything it came out of the fridge much too hard and I had to gently warm it to make it pliable and workable again although to be fair I added 1/4-1/2 cup more flour. I'm also in the UK and I think the flour may be a different consistency than US flours which might help. To sum up I think these need to be thicker baked less and possibly need more of a levening agent to get them cakier/softer.",
