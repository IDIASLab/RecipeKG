I looked through the reviews first and also made a few changes to it. I only added 1 can of tomato soup and substituted with a bit of water. Instead of tapioca I added 2 medium potatoes. I also added a touch of garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture. I was a bit more liberal with the soy sauce and also added a touch of Worchestershire. When it was ready (just over 10 hours) I wanted the broth a bit thicker so I took out 3/4 cup of the broth and added some cornstarch. I then put the stew on high to get it bubbling and then I added the cornstarch mixture back in. Next time I'll do that a bit earlier. It was just lovely. Seems like I made a lot of changes but to me they were only minor. YUM!!!!",

I do still add the tapioca but wouldn't mind trying the barley as someone else mentioned.  I added some potatoes to the original recipe as well.  I've changed it a little over the years but not by much such as adding 2 cups of beef broth for example.  It was a great recipe to happen upon and can be changed to fit your own tastes etc.",
