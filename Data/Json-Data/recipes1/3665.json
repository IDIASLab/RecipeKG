Then I de-glazed with a touch of red wine and added all the liquid and lentils. This sped up the cooking time a bit though I ended up letting it simmer for a couple hours because I had the time.\r\n\r\nNext time I will double the recipe because my girlfriend and I plowed through almost the whole recipe all by ourselves!",

Added a 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper and a couple shakes extra of the cumin and thyme. As leftovers this soup is delicious with some shredded cheddar cheese sprinkled on top! Thanks for the recipe!",
