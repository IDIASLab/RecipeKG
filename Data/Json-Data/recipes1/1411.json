                "reviewBody": "I've baked this cake at least a dozen times & always get rave reviews.  The cake is very moist with great flavor.  It tastes even better the next day! I use Baker's Joy spray to prep Bundt (non-stick or regular) & NEVER have problems with cake breaking up when inverted. I usually cool the cake 40-45 min. at most.  Sometimes butter/shortening & flour combo used to prep pans can be a problem when the cake cools completely.  This \"paste\" is almost like a glue when it completely cools. For round cake pans, you can heat pan bottom for 5-10 seconds on stove eye (electic or gas) & it will release when the butter or shortening melts slightly. This is difficult for Bundt pans.  I'm huge fan of Baker's Joy spray-it always works! Also, the chopstick idea is awesome. After the cake has cooled for 5 min, I poke 30-35 holes in the cake all the way to the bottom of the Bundt pan with the smaller, tapered end of the chopstick.  Then I spoon or pour on the butter sauce (I make 1 1/2 times the sauce recipe).  Adding 1/2 to 1 tsp cinnamon is a great variation. Also, I recommend creaming the butter & sugar for 5 min then creaming another 5 min after adding eggs/vanilla.  Then I alternate dry ingredients with buttermilk.  The cake rises like a charm (you can use a 12 cup Bundt pan). What a cake!!!",

It was originally in the Pillsbury Bake off contest in 1963 by Nell Lewis (I'm looking at the book now) The recipe is exact except that it gives the option of Rum Extract, and says to just combine all cake ingredients together, no doing dry ingredients first, or anything like that. \nToday I used 1 cup splenda and 1 cup sugar to see if taste was affected at all, and no one can tell the difference. In the past I have added almond extract to both sauce and cake, as well as peppermint and orange flavors to change it up. All yummy. It does say to use a long tined fork to pierce cake several times, I use kebab skewers and try to widen it a little. I also let it go down the sides so that there are streaks of sauce 3/4 down the cake, just take your time and do it slowly.\nFinally it says to let stand 5-10 minutes or until absorbed and then invert onto plate.",

Word to the wise, do not overmix, or overbake, test cake for doneness right around the 50 minute interval.  Instead of water try using 3 tbls. of a fine brandy or bourbon when making the sauce.  I let the sugar in my sauce melt with the brandy to the point where it is just about a syrup, but with a few crystals remaining, then I add the other ingredients, this when poured over the \"tooth pick pricked\" cake gives it a bit of a crunch, which complements the cakes texture nicely.",

More information to follow however I do know that the sauce originally was rum flavoring and you took a meat fork the one with the long tines and poke while it is in the pan right out of the oven about 50 times around the cake as far down as you can go with the fork. Then pour the hot rum sauce over the cake and leave it over night. Then pour it out onto a plate. Must be covered at all times. This is a wonderful cake.",
