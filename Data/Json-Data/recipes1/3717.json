I cut the amount of olive oil in half and didn't use any celery (never saw a vodka sauce that called for it before and didn't want to ruin this) I used 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes vs. cayenne pepper and added a couple of tsp. of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes. This was smooth creamy and delicious - excellent over penne pasta topped with a little shredded parmesan. Serve with a side of garlic bread and you have a meal in no time at all.",
