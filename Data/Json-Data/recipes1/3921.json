While browning the italian sausage, I added the celery/carrots/onions, which slightly sped up the cooking process and used (the wonderfully convenient=my personal favorite) pre-shredded/pre-packaged coleslaw mix.  I had to add a little more liquid (I just added additional water) as it started to get a little too thick towards the end but the taste was spectacular!! A few family members garnished with some shredded cheddar cheese over each bowl. Would make again and highly recommend!! Thanks Behr for sharing this recipe! Perfectly satisfying!!",

I would advise against cooking the pasta in the soup as the residual starch makes it too thick. Continue to simmer the soup while cooking pasta in a separate pot. Obviously drain pasta before adding to soup. Also since we have our own herbs I used a good bit of fresh basil leaves parsley and even a bit of rosemary- and it was fabulous. Decided to use the mini farfalle (bow ties) considering that the tomatoes were huge already. Next time I will use diced tomatoes instead as well. Everything is easier to manage with bite sizes when eating soup. Serve with crusty Italian bread and real butter. Great comfort food on a cold day.:)",

But be aware that if you're not going to consume the entire pot of soup in one sitting consider separating out the pasta for storage or it will absorb most of the liquid and you'll be left with gigantic mushy pasta and little broth. Would have given 5 stars otherwise. Unfortunatey I didn't have cabbage so I substituted fresh spinach leaves added at the last few minutes just to wilt it. This helped maintain the bright green color and was a fine alternative. Satisfying meal.",
