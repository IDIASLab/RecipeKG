I then added only four potatos which I cubed. While that was happening, I made a roux and added it to the mixture. The broth came next. After the potatoes were tender, I whirled them in the food processor to give the soup a velvety consistancy. Once back in the pot, I then added fat free half and half and topped with chives and crumbled bacon. Wonderful soup and thanks so much for a GREAT start Michele!",
