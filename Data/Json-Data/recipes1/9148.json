I think some folks made this using the smaller box of Sugar free instant pudding.  It will only work and be a wonderful consistancy if you use the large box of instant pudding.

I used half \"Hood Calorie-Countown Milk \" which is a reduced fat and low carbohydrate milk and half full-fat half-and-half. So we've got sugar-free a fruit (or vegetable) and dairy. That means you're eating a fabulous dessert that's actually good for you! (Ok let's not nitpick about the boxed pudding) Dieters those who need to watch carbs (sugar) or fat intake or those who just want to eat a little healthier rejoice! This is excellent! Tastes like a lighter less sweet pudding version of pumpkin pie. Hubs even liked it and he doesn't care for anything pumpkin. This would be a great addition (alongside traditional pumpkin pie) to your Thanksgiving table so no one with the above-mentioned dietary restrictions is left out. And for those who just want a delicious and satisfying dessert.",

I used 2 (3.4 oz) boxes of french vanilla pudding (not sugar-free) and 1/2 of a 29 oz can of pumpkin. I added close to 1 Tbls of pumpkin pie spice and used 2 cups of 2% milk since I didn't have the evaporated or skim. This tastes just like a pumpkin pie...of course it's crustless and has a different texture. Can't wait to try this out on my son. Thanks for sharing.",
