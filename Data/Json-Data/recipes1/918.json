The almond extract really compliments the cherry filling. I make this in two 9 inch round cake pans and bake them for 35 minutes.Instead of the glaze I frosted it with chocolate icing. I topped the cake with about 1 cup of additional cherry pie filling and used white icing piped around the edge to keep it from running over the sides. It looks gorgeous when finished. Everyone thinks it's from a bakery. Thanks for such a great recipe!",

I went to my cupboard (like old Mother Hubbard) and all I had was a caramel cake mix and apple pie filling. Another recipe was born. I followed the same premise using caramel cake mix white chocolate chips and apple pie filling (I chopped the apples finer). Instead of the almond extract I used 1.5 tsps of butter flavoring and 1.5 tsps of rum extract. I heated some caramel frosting and used that for a glaze. It was a major hit and the entire cake is gone. My brother's best friend said it's the best cake he's ever eaten. I can't wait to try it the \"right\" way.",

It tastes great, is so easy, and when put on a plate drizzled with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, a cherry and a wedge of chocoate, it looks and tastes like heaven.  If you're looking for an easy recipe, but still want it to be something special- look no further!

Instead of regular chocolate chips which some people on here said didn't work out so well, I used mini chocolate chips and it was perfect. I also saw on another recipe the use of Black Cherry Soda in the cake so I added about 6oz of Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda to the mix. I also used a chocolate frosting recipe I got from America's Test Kitchen and then decorated it with chocolate covered cherries. FANTASTIC!",

First off the cake ends up being a little bit dry because there is hardly any moisture in the cake itself. It looks great coming out of the oven and the taste is okay beause the base is a cake mix. I didn't personally care for the taste of the chocolate chips in the cake either. Overall I didn't care for this and I like chocolate cake! The absolute WORST part of this was the frosting! Oh my goodness.... too sweet! (Like makes the roof of your mouth itchy sweet.) If you like the type of frosting that is on Texas Sheet Cakes (and we don't) then you'll love it because that is exactly what it is without the pecans on top. Wish I had known! It would have been much better with a simple chocolate ganache or melted canned frosting drizzled on the top. Adding the pie filling to the cake mix was the only thing I'll take away from this recipe. Other than that it was a big waste of money on our tight budget. I would NEVER make this again. But for those still contemplating this one try this - get TWO cans of cherry pie filling. Make the cake in two round pans and put the extra pie filling inbetween and a layer on top. It might help rescue this one. Be prepared for a sugar rush...",
