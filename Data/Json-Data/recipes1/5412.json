The only thing I changed was I used shredded cucumber (for a more Greek taste) because I didn't have red pepper on hand and I added a soup-spoonful of sour cream! It was DELISH! It also helps that my husband and I eat anything with feta cheese too which is why I wanted to try this. Thank you so much Chris recipe is defintely a keeper! This would be an excellent dish for the summer too!",

I did not use the feta since I have a husband who strangely almost gets physically ill at the mere mention of it. (Long after I ate this I'm still tasting that raw garlic. NOT a good thing.
