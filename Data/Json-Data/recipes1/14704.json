I used Bob Evans 'Hot and zesty' sausage being that our grocer was out of Jimmy Dean's sausage and my BF doesn't really care for raw onions so I used the Chive & Onion cream cheese. Also I just bought pre-sliced french bread and cut them in 1/2. I modified this recipe some but this is a great base recipe.",
