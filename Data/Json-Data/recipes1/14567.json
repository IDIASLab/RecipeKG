The recipe is good as is!\nI have however,  made it numerous times and have adjusted a few things to my liking.  I like to double the sauce, decrease the hot peppers and only use 1 teaspoon of oil.  I also have found that using uncooked, peeled and deveined shrimp gives the dish a much better taste.  I just cook it in the oil until opaque before adding the sauce.  I just tried adding pea pods at the end, just until heated through, which was a great asian compliment to the meal.  We always serve it over botan rice.  A wonderful low fat, low calorie meal!",

I made it twice, both were very good. I added one bag of stir fry veggies, the frozen kind, just prepare in the microwave and drain well before adding to the finished shrimp mixture. Could use fresh veggies as well, but I like the frozen. I also tried crushing 2 of the cloves of garlic and adding them to the sauce and using the remaining 2 cloves as recipe says, it gives the sauce a more garlic flavor.Also be careful not to overcook the shrimp!",

One suggestion though, if you are making this recipe use 6 tablespoons of water (not 4) and use more olive oil when cooking. Also, don't let the smell of the sauce confuse you at first, I thought it was disguisting too. But, when you cook it the sauce gets REALLY yummy!
