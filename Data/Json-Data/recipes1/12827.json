My sons love the boxed stuff and I was trying to coax them away from it with this recipe. I thought I would try layering the noodles and cheese so that there would be cheese throughout not just on top however it still didn't solve the problem of bland taste. I'm not sure I would try it again but if I did I would try mixing it all together and see if that helps.",

I thought it seemed like a lot of milk but the key is to make sure you stir until thick and the milk just absorbed right into the casserole during baking. I also used shredded cheese rather than sliced b/c that is all I had on hand and it was perfect and easier. I will definitely replace my old mac and cheese recipe with this one.",

This was salty enough not even my husband added salt. Just thought I would give a heads up to those that dont like it. Anyways thank you for sharing this was delicious!!",
