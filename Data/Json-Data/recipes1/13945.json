I've made this many times and have found the easiest way to make the caramel is to peel the label off the cans of sweetened condensed milk - Do Not Open the can - drop the cans into a pot of boiling water (enough to cover the cans plus an inch or so) and boil for 3 hrs. Let the cans cool, open the can and you have the best caramel without the mess of the baking dish and water bath! SO EASY!",

The absolute easiest way to turn the condensed milk into caramel is to submerse the unopened cans completely in water in the crock pot overnight on low with the lid of the crock pot on. You never have to worry about making sure that the can is always covered. I make an oreo cookie crust put my bananas between the caramel and whipped cream and whip up some whipping cream instead of the frozen whipped topping. As long as the bananas are completely covered with the whipped cream you can make this ahead of time. I often double the recipe and make it in a 9x13 dish. My children request this for their birthdays instead of cake!",
