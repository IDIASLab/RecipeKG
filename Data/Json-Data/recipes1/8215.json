Filling them while they are raw is fine...just make sure the manicotti \"rests\" in the sauce for at least a few hours before cooking so it absorbs some of the moisture from the sauce.  I followed ingredients almost exactly, except I added a large can of crushed tomatoes in addition to the spaghetti sauce and I added a teaspoon of garlic salt and a dash of italian seasoning to the cheese mixture.  Adding a can of crushed tomatoes gives it more of a homemade taste and more moisture because Prego / Ragu tends to tast a little processed.  Adding the garlic salt and italian seasoning gave the cheese more flavor.  Anyway, it came out great!  Very creamy and flavorful.  I also made sure to use good quality fresh grated Parmesan...none of that green can stuff!  Definitely a keeper!  P.S. I would NOT recommend adding an egg to the mixture...unless you want ricotta cheese that has scrambled egg consistancy!  This mixture stays together fine without it, so don't add it!!!",

They were perfectly cooked by the end of baking. I didn't have enough mixture to stuff all of the pasta, though. I had 4 tubes left over. I didn't use whole milk ricotta or mozz... I used part skim to save a few calories. Finally, 3 and a half 32-ounce jars of pasta sauce is entirely too much! I used 2 26-ounce jars of pasta sauce and it was still too much... and I like my pasta saucey! All in all this was a nice change from lasagna or spaghetti. I added ground beef and zucchini to the sauce to make it a little more hearty. Thanks for posting!",
