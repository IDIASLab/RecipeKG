Then I shredded the meat with 2 forks and poured the rest of the sauce over it, turned off the oven and when it was time to eat (about 1 1/2 hrs later)popped it on buns and ate heartily.  Loved it!

About 3 years ago I had been to a family reunion in NC where there was a pig roast and they served the pork with a delicious spicy vinegar dressing that I'd never tried before. Since then I've had a craving for this sauce. I scaled the sauce by half and made last night. Today I put a half picnic in my slow cooker all day while I was at work. I added about 1/4 cup of the sauce over the pork while cooking. After draining and shredding the pork I mixed about 3/4 of the remainder of the sauce with the shredded pork. I served with some homemade cole slaw homemade corn bread and baked beans and it was just great! Thanks so much. My search for a great Carolina BBQ recipe is over. Thanks so much!!",

This mop sauce is used for roasting the pig for chopped BBQ. I use it when grilling chops ribs or a pork shoulder which I grilled a couple a days ago. Very good give it a try. (TIP!!!! if you really want that eastern North Carolina taste add a little hickory or oak wood to your coals.",
