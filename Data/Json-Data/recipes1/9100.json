Also i tried a rosemary garlic version of this where i roasted the garlic. I also boiled the potatoes with half the liquid consisting of water and half chicken broth and added garlic. Well ive tried many versions...you can always play with mashed potatoes. By far the best gravy i have ever had consisted of 2 cups of my chicken broth i boiled the potatoes in and the rest turkey stock and added chopped portobello mushrooms...it was to die for. I wouldnt use olive oil in mashed potatoes use butter. You dont want that oily consistency.",
