Just about any waffle will get hard if you leave it sit long (these ones were no exception) but these are fluffy when fresh. Perhaps not quite worth the effort but my family guessed what the flavour was so they do taste like Gingerbread. Note that the batter looks very heavy but it rises a lot when cooking. I only got 5 waffles out of it; in future I will halve the chocolate sauce recipe as it made too much even though everyone used it By the way I used \"normal\" molasses and it was fine (what is \"Light\" molasses?).",

I am certain no chef; just a housewife but I do not understand how anyone could have difficulty with this recipe. NOTE: Make sure you dissolve the cornstarch in a little bit of water before adding it to the sauce or you will get a few lumps. I had children pulling at my legs so I skipped that step. Then when I reheated the sauce the next morning I found a few lumps. The only change I would make only because of person preference is I would use milk instead of water the next time I make the chocolate sauce a little more rich.",
