I used full fat sour cream and mayo, green onion other than the red, and real, crumbled bacon, but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written. And I will next time too! Looking over the reviews, if you omit bacon, omit onion, omit the mustard, etc.--are you really trying or reviewing THIS recipe?  I like the addition of sour cream (I do in all my mayonnaise-based salads as well) as it mellows out the tang of the mayonnaise. I've used Dijon mustard before and love it, but it was the bacon and horseradish that really were this recipe's claim to distinction!  Loved it!",

I did replace the red onion with green onion and used smoked paprika instead of regular (just because I always have it in my pantry) and it was a nice compliment to the bacon.
