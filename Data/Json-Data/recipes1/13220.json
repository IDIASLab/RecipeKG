I put the chili powder (and a little less) into the sauce and used a mix of 2% and 1% milk.  I used more pasta too, probably 2.5 cups and I could have used more, but I like an extra cheesey, saucey sauce opposed to a drier sauce.  We had broccoli with this and spooned some of the extra sauce over that.  I used radiatore pasta in this and it was wonderful.  Shredded my own parm, used Tillamook Pepperjack and Tillamook Extra Sharp Reserve White Cheddar cheese.  Used a bit extra of all the cheeses.  LOVED it!!!  I used crushed garlic croutons in place of bread crumbs and butter.  We couldn't get enough.  I will make this again.",

I used pepper cheddar instead of pepper jack since I had it on hand; probably no significant difference.  3. The pasta amount is definitely a typo.  I used more like 2.5 cups.  4. Personally, the hot sauce heat level was fine or too low, but I did not love the vinegar aspect it added.  Next time I will do a combo of jalapenos and cayenne.   5. I will add more mustard next time and mix the chili powder into the sauce.  6. I added parmesan to the bread crumb/butter mixture and melted in the microwave instead of in a pan. Worked beautifully and saved me a dish to wash.  Overall, this is a really good recipe.  I may just have a piggy husband, but 8 servings is debatable. ",

If you like traditional comfort food with a big twist, this is your ticket right here.  I added some Oscar Mayer bacon bits.
