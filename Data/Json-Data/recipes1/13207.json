I added an egg to help hold the loaf together and changed some of the whole wheat flour to oat flour which unfortunately made it more crumbly. If you don't have buttermilk (which can be difficult to find in stores) you can go a couple of different directions. You can follow the advice of one of the other reviewers and use vinegar milk. (Not the tastiest option.) You can buy powdered buttermilk in bulk food stores which is what I used and is also not terribly tasty. Yogurt mixed with a bit of milk to loosen it up is a good option although lowfat yogurt can also be a bit bland. The tastiest substitute is probably sour cream but also the fattiest. I added 2 cups of currents which gave it a nice sweet flavor. I think next time I'll add more oil or butter to give the loaf more flavor.",

I've neither had nor made this before, but it's my mum's favourite so I whipped it up last night. So easy and so GOOD! I didn't have buttermilk so I made some using milk and vinegar (1 tbsp/cup milk - let sit 10 min.) and it's still getting rave reviews. I got 2 round loaves, and the shapes came out a little different because I scored the top of one with an X and left the other one alone. The X loaf came out rounder while the untouched loaf rose upwards a little more. It kind of looks like a muffin. Aesthetically, I liked the X loaf better, but they taste equaly great. Thanks for the recipe!!",
