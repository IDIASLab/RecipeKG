Although the b.f. didn't mind the couscous addition he said it made it \"goulash-y.\" The lamb came out tender and very flavorful which surprised me because most stew recipes call for searing the meat first so when this recipe suggests just stirring it in I was skeptical but it made for some delicious lamb and even a nice lamb flavor to the broth (which was then usurped by the couscous). Also the flavor was a little bland and if I make this again I will double the spices and use chili powder instead of cayenne - that made it have this weird southwestern flavor that seemed out of place. The beaten eggs added at the end got lost and I didn't notice their impact at all. Next time if there is one I will definitely skip the whole pasta and egg part.",
