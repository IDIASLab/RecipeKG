I used the refrigerator case cookie dough and slightly microwaved it just to soften up for pressing into ungreased 9X13 foil ovenware pan (rolling it out sounded like too much work). I did not sprinkle dough with sugar prior to baking (it will be sweet enough after the caramel goes on). I sliced and sauteed Granny Smith apples in butter then sprinkled with 1 tsp. of brown sugar and cinnamon each. Then I spread out 1/4 cup melted caramel onto baked cookie arranged apple slices then spoon-drizzled with another 1/4 cup melted caramel. I gave it a BAM! of powdered sugar just for show. It cuts like a dream into 24 bars. The ovenware I used came with a plastic lid - perfect for traveling to picnics or potlucks but it's easier to serve if you cut into bars before traveling.",
