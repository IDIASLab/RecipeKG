I scaled this to 32 servings (4 cups powdered sugar) for my 9\" layer cake and still wish I would have had more for decorating. I beat the butter a few minutes until fluffy, gradually added the full amount of powdered sugar called for and enough coffee until I got it to the consistency I wanted.  I beat the frosting for several more minutes after that, until it was light, creamy, fluffy and silky smooth. This is pleasantly light chocolate - not too strong, and not too sweet, with just a hint of coffee flavor.  I found the proportions of all ingredients perfect, and this will be a recipe I'll certainly be comfortable referring to again, whether I use it with the coffee or without, with the chocolate or just as a traditional vanilla buttercream.  This frosting as written, however, was the perfect choice for \"Chocolate Mocha Cake I,\" also from this site.",

Almost too good to be true, it's so simple. Thank you very much for sharing.",
