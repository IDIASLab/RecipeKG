Drain in colander. Put mushroom caps on paper towels to drain well. Slice off woody part of stem and put in food processor. Pulse stems until minced. Add 1 Tlbs olive oil to pan and stir-fry minced stems and garlic (minced type from jar)until dry. Add spices. Slightly cool, but while still warm add  cheeses (and a can of drained crab if want). Put a plastic zip lock bag into a bowl and roll back sides- add cream cheese mixture. Snip off one corner and use as a pastry bag to fill mushrooms. If making ahead 1)use only freshest mushrooms you can find, 2)blot off excess water from mushrooms, 3)put them into a non-metalic dish. I sprinkle the tops with shreded (not grated )parmesan cheese. Cover well with plastic wrap and refrig. until ready to bake. (I've made up to two days in advance- without crabmeat though).",

These are great to bring to get togethers.  I usually prepare the stuffing and put into a ziplock and assemble them when I arrive.  Just snip off the corner of the ziplock, fill the mushrooms like a pastry and pop in the oven. Adjustments I make are I add crabmeat to the mixture which I find adds a little more substance to an otherwise very creamy filling.  I like to sprinkle with parmesan cheese before putting them in the oven which adds a nice touch.  A trick I use is to use smaller mushrooms so there is a good balance between mushroom and the amount of filling.  I tried larger ones one time and it almost seemed like each bite was just a bit too full of creamy mixture.  I also lightly butter the mushrooms before baking which keeps them from drying out.  Last trick is I bake them in mini muffin tin pans.  They hold the smaller mushrooms perfectly and the pans keep the mushrooms from tipping over and rolling around.  The cayenne pepper gives just the perfect amount of kick to this recipe.",

For my family's personal preference, I added the following....  16 oz of ground sausage, increased the Parmesan to 1/2 cup and the garlic to 1.5 tbsp, and then rolled the top of the stuffed mushrooms in the Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoned Panko bread crumbs prior to baking.  Created a great little crunch with wonderful oozy goodness underneath.  Absolutely divine!!!",

I rated accordingly since i changed it a bit. I used 12 large mushrooms (caps about 2\" wide) as the recipe called for as well as the the whole pkg of cream cheese and it was just right. Next time, though, I will use bite size smaller mushrooms but double the amount of mushrooms to make it easier to eat as a appetizer. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and  added to the original ingredients for the filling: 2 stalks green onions (minced and cooked with the garlic and mushroom stems), a bit more parmesan (used fresh grated parmesano reggiano), a bit of garlic powder, 1 crisp, crumbled bacon and about a cup of cooked dungeoness crab. I dunked the mushroom caps in melted butter & lemon before filling, sprinkled with more parmesan and baked in a mini muffin pan. (Beware: if the mushrooms don't fit all the way into the muffin pan, they will come out shaped like muffins! It is kind of cute though.) Cooked for 20 mins and they came out beautifully! Everyone loved them! The parmesan topping gave it that extra crunch too! And love the heat the Cayenne leaves after you eat it. Will make (my new revised recipe again!) Thanks!  ",

The full amount of cream cheese was enough for 24 mushrooms and I placed a bit of chopped proscuitto in the bottom of each mushroom before placing the cheese mixture on top (which was wonderful). I then sprinkled garlic and herb bread crumbs over them and drizzled melted butter over all. Baked for only 15 minutes and broiled for the last 5. They were wonderful. I plan on making these when my Mom and Grandmom come to visit in the fall. Thanks a bunch!",

I followed some other reviewers' suggestions and added 1/4 cup or seasoned breadcrumbs, and cut the cream cheese to about 2/3 what the recipe called for. I also used 2 10oz pkgs of white mushrooms, or about double what the recipe specified. I'm sure adding crabmeat would've made it even better, but i don't think it needs it... i kept the recipe cheap, quick, and easy!",
