I made a whole pound of macaroni...so I doubled the recipe. I followed it pretty close except I used two 14.5oz cans of diced tomatoes and and 8oz can of tomato sauce instead of using the sieve, and I used half kalamotta and half greek olives. Those of you who think there is too much olive oil...that's what puttanesca is supposed to be like. It is not supposed to be tomatoey and sweet like marinara. Puttanesca should be bitter and spicy...and that's just what this is. Thanks for an incredible recipe! This one goes into my rotation.

I chop the tomatoes in the food processer rather than pushing them through a seive, and substitute anchovy paste for filets.  The ratio of ingredients is pretty flexible, but I wouldn't recommend leaving any ingredients out completely...I made it without the anchovy for a vegetarian friend and the flavor was completely different (good, but nothing like the original).  Also, keep in mind that the flavors are strong and will be overpowering if you put too much on your pasta (use half as much as you would if it were a marinara sauce).  This may be the reason that so many reviews say that the sauce is too salty or the olive/caper taste is too strong.",

True, the sauce is a bit salty because of these ingredients, but a little sauce goes a long way in flavor!  **** UPDATE 3/14/08 ***** I made this with sea bass last night and it was delicious.  On foilm I laid down some lemon slices, topped with the fish, then the puttanesca sauce.  Fold the foil up to make a pouch and bake at 400 degrees for 18 minutes.  The puttanesca sauce compliments the fish.  Excellent recipe!",

I cut back just a smidge on the oil used a 15oz can of petite diced tomatoes (we like it chunky!) instead of fresh added an extra clove of garlic and used regular black olives - presliced from a can since that's what I had on hand. Otherwise all ingredients and amounts were left as written. I did add the chopped anchovies to the oil while I sauteed the garlic so they basically \"melted\" away and just left the flavor. This was so good I couldn't stop eating it! Even my husband commented on how good it was! (I didn't tell him it had anchovies until after he raved about it.:) I'm usually very sensitive to saltiness but this was fine - not too salty at all. I did rinse the anchovies before using them so maybe that did it. This will definitely be a regular in our house - thanks so much!",
