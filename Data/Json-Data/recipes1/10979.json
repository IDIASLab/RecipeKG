For anyone who likes finding a crust under their pumpkin filling, this recipe is not for you. Unlike the description implies, there is no crust that magically forms under the filling.  But that doesn't stop me from giving it a 2 thumbs up, it is wonderful and delicious.  The original recipe on the Bisquick box advised mixing ingredients together in the blender for 1 minute, which is how I always do it.  The best!!",
