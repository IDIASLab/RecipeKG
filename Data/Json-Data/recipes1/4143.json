Personally I like to add some diced garlic (about 1 or 2 cloves) to the sauteing onions and tomato and chopped basil to the soup when I pour in the tofu mixture (rather than just as a garnish). I'm also slightly lazy so I substitute an equivalent amount of no-salt-added canned diced tomatoes and use the reserved juice from the cans in place of the water. Keep in mind - this will thicken upon standing so if you're making extra to put in the fridge you may need to add a bit of tomato juice or water when you reheat it.",
