Being from Tennessee if green beans haven't cooked for at least 2 hours then they are not done. Such a quick and easy way to get your vegetables. And like everyone else I put my spin on it the second time around. I added a can of shoe-peg corn a chopped onion some chicken stock and sliced almonds. Yum!Yum! The third time I made it using vegetable stock(preferred the chicken stock) I had cooked boneless pork ribs(no barbecue sauce)to go with it. When I went to reheat it the next day I shredded the pork and added it to the pot. Another Yummer! Next time I try it for myself I'm going to use 1 can of green beans and 1 can of black beans or maybe just use 2 cans of the black beans for a Mexican flavor. (I'm fixing it for the family dinner at my sister's this week.) Thanks so much for this recipe Lori!!!!",
