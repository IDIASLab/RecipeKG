To give you a back ground on gumbo it is a MEAT stew served over rice. It never has tomatoes in it. I have been to many states and outside of La gumbo is trashed into some sorta gross dish. The meat is what is changed in it........it never contains carrots and stuff since it is a MEAT stew. insulted.....",

I used 6 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of water and ended up with a spicy simple to make treat. If you don't like things spicy you might want to cut down on the hot pepper sauce. Hubby didn't care for the spiciness so I may try this next time though I liked it as is. Thanks for this recipe!",
