(Beau Monde seasoning is basically celery salt and onion powder) I cut this recipe back to make one batch for one bowl of air popped popcorn. I tossed my popcorn with a mixture of EVOO and butter, then sprinkled the spice mix over my popcorn. I really liked the combination of the cumin, curry and cayenne with the salty-parmesan-ish flavor of the Brewer's yeast. Brewer's yeast on popcorn is one of my favorite treats so I knew I was in for something good. Next time I make this, I'd cut back on the Beau Monde. For me, it was a little too salty and the celery flavor overpowered everything else. Good spice mix--very different but in a surprizing way.",

I made this exactly as written the first time, and although my family cook with a lot of salt, we couldn't eat this. \nThe flavour was really good though so we gave it another go. I increased the brewers yeast to 4 tbsp and cut out the garlic salt and substituted 1 tsp garlic powder and only put in 1 tbsp celery salt. This, in our opinion made it fantastic.\nI hate when reviewers review their changes and not the recipe so my 4 stars is based on the original recipe. In my opinion cut out some of the salt and you have a winner.\nAs an FYI this will make a lot of bowls of popcorn - it's not just for one serving.",
