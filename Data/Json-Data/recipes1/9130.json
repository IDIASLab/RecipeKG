I should have known there would be a problem when I saw the amount of yeast...3/4 teaspoon is a third of a package of yeast and that was suppose to make two bread rings rise??? It came out of my bread machince just fine, but after 1 1/2 hours of letting the rings rise, they hadn't grown at all. I baked them anyway and there was brown sugar all over the cookie sheets and the bottom of my oven. They didn't rise at all during the baking time either.",

Of course I don't have a bread machine anymore, so I had to make by hand.  Still delicious.  I used dried cherries because that's what I had on hand, and I added some chopped pecans.  I got praise from everyone who tried it.\n\nIf you want to make it without a bread machine its pretty easy.  I warmed the milk in the microwave then added the yeast and let it sit for about 15 minutes.  Place the milk/yeast in a stand mixer and add the egg, sugar, and salt.  Add the flour, mix until absorbed, then the butter.  Mix until doughy.  Cover and let sit for 1-1/2 hours then proceed with the recipe.",

As another review noted the filling does escape slightly from the dough during baking but there is plenty of cinnamon-roll flavor. This recipe makes a wonderful coffee cake that is as scrumptious as it is attractive.",
