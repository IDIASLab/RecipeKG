The result is a very typical European bread that is heavy dense can be sliced SUPER thin and served much like soft crackers. It is also however dense with nutrients and I thought this was a very good recipe for bread! After reading the other reviews I added an extra teaspoon of xanthan gum to hold it together and keep it moist. This worked out wonderfully.",

I use Spelt for all my baking bread cakes cookies etc using any wheat recipe I find! the key is adjusting quanties of liquid added and kneading/mixing times. Keep any kneading to a minimum after 3-4 mins the gluten will collapse. Add more liquid than the recipe calls for you want your mixture to be marginally \"sloppier\" than when using wheat this will make your end product light and airy. If you treat spelt like wheat in recipes you will end up with a very dense result. (as I found out when I first started)",

When making spelt bread it is a good idea to add some Zanthan Gum (about 1 tsp. per cup of spelt) This will help it to rise better. Also keep in mind that spelt doesn't have gluten in it (the reason many people use it) so it will be a more dense bread. Don't be expecting a light fluffy loaf. If you are find a different grain!! Great Recipe!!",

                "reviewBody": "This bread has the potential to be great. You just have to have the right method. If you are using dry active yeast (as the recipe calls for) you need to add the yeast to the water (which I always heat to 100 degrees) and let it sit 10 minutes before you add the other ingredients. If you don't most of your yeast will not become active and you will end up with a dense loaf. Also lecithin is very important when making spelt as it acts similar to gluten and allows the bread to rise. Lastly I always just use milk and skip the powder. I also usually double the lecithin for a lighter loaf. The bread is great especially when toasted! Toasting really brings out the wonderful natural flavor of the spelt.",
