After putting the chicken mixture in the middle of the crescent rectangle, I just fold the sides flat up over the top and gently pinch closed to make a little packet.  I used to twist the sides together on top as originally listed, and had problems with it staying \"doughy\" in the center of the twist - you nearly have to overcook them to get it done that way.  Most of the time I omit the butter on top of the crescent rolls and no one has ever noticed the difference.  I do use Cavender's Greek Seasoning in the chicken mixture, and I think that is the secret to a really spectacular recipe. It's definitely a keeper and a standard in my recipe file!  :o)",

I also needed two packs of crescent rolls and put a heaping tablespoon inside each triangle.  Sealed them anyway they would and topped with the melted butter and roasted garlic flavored breadcrumbs.  They're pretty and easy to handle in the muffin tin method.  350 degrees for about 17-20 minutes worked for me.",

I also do not use the pimento or brush the crescent tops with butter and sprinkle with croutons but they still turn out delicious.  One suggestion I do have is to season the chicken a bit while cooking.  I usually poach the chicken in chicken broth and season with salt, pepper and a little of Emeril's original essence spice just to give it a bit more flavor.  Also, do not let the crescent rolls sit out too long as you prepare the chicken.  I found that it makes the dough too soft and when you go to wrap the chicken mixture it tears much easier.  Keep the dough chilled until you are ready to use.",

Basically fold two longest sides up until they meet & pinch together.  Then fold up and over the short sides (1/4th of the way) ...pinch, then flip over the entire crescent so the folded side is on cookie sheet (again, see pic)!  Also, without a doubt... TWO crescent rolls are needed to complete these, making a total of 8.  I find it a lot easier to use my largest cookie scoop 1/4C so they're consistent and it's exactly the amount of mix this makes!!  Due to recommendations, I found a few T of red peppers and a handful of almond accents (sliced FLAVORED almonds in the salad section) make this taste wonderful w/a nice crunch.  Breadcrumbs instead of croutons taste terrible as a substitute, so don't do it! Also, using generic crescents make this not turn out the same.",
