One tip is to use fat free cream cheese and low fat whipped topping and pie filling. It makes no difference in the taste and you have less guilt having seconds. In addition you can use any flavor pie filling. They all work well.",

When making the crust the recipe called for only 1/2 cup ground pecans - I ended up using a whole cup. The finish product was shortbread with a definate pecan taste. I could only find a 15oz of lemon pudding in my store so I grabbed a fresh lemon and added the zest and the juuce to the canned pudding to make it taste fresh and losen up the pudding and make it go further. It worked perfect and the juice and zest really kicked up the lemon flavor.",
