The best way to make grilled zucchini is to cut them in half lengthwise, brush with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Then, just toss them on the grill flat side down for about 5-10 mins and then flip over for a few more mins depending on the size and thickness of your zucchinis. You'll get the nice grill marks, a juicy, sweet, soft yet crispy veggie. Now that's grilled zucchini!",
