They are very chewy moist etc. I found cooking time needed to be extended several minutes. I baked 8 min. bottom shelf and 8 min. top shelf. Mine weren't dry at all. Next time I would add more cinnamon more raisins. Also I got 4 dozen good sized cookies. Can't imagine how large they'd have to be to get only 3 dozen they filled the cookie sheet as it was. Will make again. I have toddlers hence omitting the nuts and I like the fact they are getting some fiber/nutrition (raisins oatmeal). They were a hit with the kids!",
