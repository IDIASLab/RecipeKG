I cubed the chicken before cooking it, and then I cooked it in a frying pan with a little olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic powder which gave the chicken a nice flavor. \r\n\r\nI suggest starting the boiling water right away like the recipe says. I waited a little while and forgot how long it does take for water to boil, and then you can time it so the pasta is done at the same time as the sauce.\r\n\r\nI followed other reviewers' suggestions and added a third tablespoon of pesto and that seemed like a great amount. We love tomatoes so next time I would add more. GREAT recipe!",

But More Pesto Please!\" I should've taken the advice of other reviewers and up'ed the pesto b/c it was just a dainty kiss of flavor. I used more broccoli and less pasta (penne's all that I had but hey they're tubes too) and I also sauteed onion and bell pepper w/ the garlic. I also used an Italian-seasoned can of tomatoes as opposed to chopped fresh. I don't think that I changed the recipe too terribly much so I'm only giving it 4 stars b/c I think 1.) Needs the onion inclusion or at least more veggies & less noodle. 2.) Definitely needs more pesto and 3.) No wait just the 2. It's a good meal and all the better that it's not a heavy-creamy-pesto dish so the brightness of color and flavor is a nice harmony with the \"healthy\" fats of the oil and pesto.",
