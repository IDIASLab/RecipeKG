It still didn't thicken up much & worried me but after adding the whipped cream & refrigerating it it did set up. I tried umnolding onto a plate but it didn't hold it's shape very well so I spooned it into parfait glasses topped it w/ some whipped cream & drizzled some coffee liquer over it. Not sure why it's said the gelatin separates there were no layers to mine (maybe I didn't fold in the whipped cream well enough) but it was tasty nevertheless.",
