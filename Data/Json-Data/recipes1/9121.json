Forget the cinnamon candy (totally unauthentic!) but use nonpareils. These look like brownies so it might be a good idea to warn guests! The cloves were too strong when the cookies were fresh but after a few days they tasted fine to us. I used parchment for these and did not grease it or the sheet. These keep well and don't dry out sitting out on the buffet table for hours. Enjoy!",

For the icing I added orange peel and more juice to make a thin glaze. Another commenter suggested \"dropping\" these on parchment paper which I did. Made a very authentic cookie. Roll into golf-ball size for the most attractive cookie. Do not overbake. At 325 F check at 15 mins for golf-ball sized dough balls. After you cool the honey sugar mix the most effective way to mix is with your hands. It's a difficult and messy step but I believe it is what makes these so authentic. What's up with the red hots?!?

This year I rolled the dough into large balls almost golf ball size. They spread to about 3 1/2 inches and looked like traditional Lebkuchen. Bake on parchment paper about 18-20 minutes. It makes about 3 dozen big cookies. Next time I think I'll make logs before refrigerating and cut thick slices for ease of handling this very thick sticky dough. I decorated them with a chocolate glaze and candy sprinkles. I've been asked for the recipe many times.",

I followed the recipe exactly in terms of ingredients except that I made my own candied orange peel which provided great flavor and texture that store-bought candied fruit rarely does. I also chopped the almonds in the food processor until they were somewhat finely chopped but were not in danger of reaching a flour-like grind. And then instead of using the cake pan technique which I worried might make the cookies tend to dry out and because I wanted a more traditional cookie I dropped the equivalent of one and a half to two tablespoons on a parchment-covered cookie sheet. Then since the tops were somewhat spiky due to the stickiness of the dough I wet my fingers and smoothed the tops down a bit which resulted in a nicely smooth top for icing. A perfect holiday cookie not only because it tastes wonderfully like Christmas but also because it keeps so well and thus can be made well ahead of time. I'll be making these every year from now on!",

I have included a photo of the page that my mother-in-law saved all these years. It became her specialty, and now I make it every year.
