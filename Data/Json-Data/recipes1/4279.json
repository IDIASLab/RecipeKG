Because the candy bar chunks melt during baking some of the cookies end up somewhat misshapen but they're so peanut buttery delicious I would hardly say it matters.",

Other things I discovered you have to leave them on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before you move them to a cookie rack to finish cooling. Do not leave large chucks of candy on the outside of the dough balls or they will not work well. Do not eat while still hot or the candy will burn you warm is good though. I also ended up with closer to five dozen rather than two so prepare to make a lot.",

I doubled this recipe (10 Butterfingers!) and I'm glad I did because I would have cried if the guys ate all of these while I'm at work tomorrow but now I'm also a little nervous because I can't stop eating them and there might not be any left by the time I go to work tomorrow and they know I made a double batch so that would be pretty embarassing. Mine turned out a little flat but I like flat cookies so thanks for the recipe!!! UPDATE 3-19: I bought a CASE of Butterfingers yesterday and I'm getting down with this recipe again today. I forgot to mention in my earlier review that you need to let these guys cool on the baking sheet or they will fall apart. Thanks!:)",

These were really great cookies overall. We bought full-size butterfinger candy bars for Halloween and had several leftover laying around the house. So I went in search of a recipe for them. I followed the recipe exactly and then added about 3/4 cup of milk chocolate chips. These turned out nicely. I used a silicone baking sheet on my cookie sheet and I would never attempt these without one. The candy makes the cookies sticky and prone to burning. The silicone mat prevents this. The candy bar adds a deep buttery flavor to the cookie and the additional chocolate chips really made a difference -- I don't think I would have liked them as much without. I removed them from the oven when the cookies were not yet fully set. It's crucial that you leave them on the cookie sheet or they'll fall apart. This also allows them to continue cooking. Great recipe -- a real keeper.",
