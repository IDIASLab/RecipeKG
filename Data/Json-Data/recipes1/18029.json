The difference was in the technique and very minor ingredient changes. The night before the party I juiced the limes but prior to cutting/juicing them I zested them. I added the zest to the lime juice and then combined it with the pomegranate juice and granulated sugar and put it all in the refrigerator. (Doing it this way really intensifies the lime flavor and allows you to use regular sugar.) I put the liquors in the freezer that night. The morning of the party I strained the pom/lime juice and then combined the juice and liquor and put the whole thing in the freezer until party time. This means it is REALLY cold before serving and your ice won't melt right away and dilute the drink when you pour into the salted glasses. Doubling the recipe used 2/3 of the liquor in each 750 ml bottle and yielded a half-gallon of the cocktail. If you want enough for a gallon be sure to buy the larger liquor bottles. ENJOY!",
