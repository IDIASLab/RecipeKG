After fumbling with the parchment paper method unsuccessfully (I didn't think of stapling it until after the fact but just folding it up didn't work) I placed the pie in a brown paper grocery sack folded the open end down under the sack and it worked great. Just be careful that the fold doesn't cause your pie to be tilted. I researched the paper bag method a bit online and found others who even sell pies made this way. They mentioned that the bag keeps the apples moist and gives them a chance to fully cook without overcooking the crust. Next time I may take it out of the bag to brown a bit more at the end of the baking time but it still had nice color after 1 hour as called for. I used 6 medium Granny Smith Apples and added a teaspoon of cinnamon since I think something is missing without cinnamon in an apple pie! I will make this again since the topping is a nice touch.",
