For kids it's perfect.\" It was a lazy movie afternoon and we were out of popcorn but had a mixey-uppey pantry of the remnants of everything that this party mix consisted of so it was a nice snack to nibble on. I like that unlike so many snack mixes that require baking in butter and spices that this is just measure pour eat but I think the ratio of ingredients should increase the cheese crackers by a bit.",
