You must incorporate all the ingredients until smooth and then LET IT REST. You can roll it out with a rolling pin and of course a pasta machine is faster. It just  seems to me that many people are ready to criticize the recipe and not take responsibility for the chance that maybe they did it wrong.

After reading a variety of the reviews its clear that most didn't mix the pasta long enough to allow the gluton in the flour to do their stuff and then allow it to rest for a half hour.  Also, unless you have been making pasta for years, you will not have enough experience on how thin to roll it out.  Pasta is generally very thin that is difficult to get to without a machine.  I prefer to use 3 eggs and 2 egg yolks with a pinch of salt with that amount of ap flour.  ",
