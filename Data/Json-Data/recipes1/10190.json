I sauteed the onion and garlic for a few minutes, added the scallops and sauteed them for about 4 minutes then removed them from the pan. I then added all the other ingredients and let it cook down to the amount I needed and desire consistency. Returned the scallops and served over angel hair pasta. Excellent!",

I did make some changes to the recipe per the reviews of other users.  I used a half butter, half olive oil combo instead of margarine...I used scallions instead of the onions....I added shrimp, mushrooms and about 1 1/2 cups of shredded swiss cheese....I used parmesan cheese instead of romano and I only added a little parm during the cooking and added most of it right before serving while I was adding the swiss cheese.  This came out delish, it was like being at the olive garden. The only thing that I will change next time is to double the sauce because with the added shrimp and mushrooms the sauce didn't seem too plentiful.  I got rave reviews from my bro-in-law and sis and their only complaint was that they wanted more sauce. I served this with garlic bread and the remainder of white wine.  Great! One more tip...add the cheese when it is warm, not boiling.  So basically take it off the stove and let it set for maybe 5 minutes before adding the cheese.  I figured this out the hard way.  If you add the cheese when it's too hot it will clump up and stick to everything.  The sauce doesn't get creamy that way.  Only if you add it when it's warm.",

I now add twice as much garlic, use half chicken both, half white wine, a half teaspoon each of oregano and basil, and a good sprinkling of red pepper flakes to this recipe.  It was good back then, but it kicks butt now.  Thicken with cornstarch just enough for the sauce to stick to the noodle.  This is one of my favorite recipes.  Serve with salad and garlic bread.
