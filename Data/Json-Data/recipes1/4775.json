I quartered the grapes (thought the whole grapes wouldn't integrate well at eating time, and I'm glad I did it this way), but other than that, strictly followed the recipe.  I don't really understand the comments by those that were disappointed with this recipe, but I guess to each his or her own.  I made if for a friend that is on a fat-restricted diet due to MS, and it was a bit hit.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I have added it to my \"repertoire\" and will be making this again.",

After marinating for a couple hours, heat a little oil in a pan, and saute chicken and sauce for 25-30 minutes.  Add grapes (which I also halved) ten minutes before serving.  Serve with rice.

I served it with white rice and peas. I liked the first few bites then I had to really choke the rest down. After I realized I didn't like the sauce I tried to add a few more spices (garlic salt onion powder oregano a little of the chicken broth) and a little flour to thicken it up a bit. It was OK at best to me but as I said the rest of the family liked it. None of us cared for the cooked grapes however. Not the worst I've ever had but I think if I ever make this again I will omit the vinegar.",
