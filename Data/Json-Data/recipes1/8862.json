The cookies were sort of dry and bland with all of the shortening so for the second batch I used 1/2 cup of butter 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup margarine. I also added 1/4 tsp. of salt. Tips: 1) The powered sugar sticks better if you let cookies cool slightly then roll; let them completely cool and roll again. Can also add sugar sprinkles to the powered sugar for some color. 2) Mix did not completely fill the quart jar so I put some powered sugar with colored sprinkles in a baggie tied it with a ribbon and set it on top of mix.",

I tried adding coconut and white chocolate chips. I liked the chips but the coconut didn't add much to the cookie. I put just a little less than a cup of pecans in the jars and topped them with white chips. I used quart-sized jars for this and can't wait to send snowballs in a jar to my friends who live in warmer climates. Note: Once mixed the ingredients form a crumble rather than a dough and I made the balls bigger than 1\" and got about 2 dozen cookies.",

I really like cookies that have a rather shortbread like texture like these and the flavor is perfect. I used half butter and half shortening because that's what I had and I decided to make 2 types of snowballs by splitting the dough in half. In one half I put the teaspoon of vanilla and half a cup chocolate chips (we don't like nuts). In the other I put a teaspoon of peppermint extract and half a cup of white chips. I got exactly 24 cookies and rolled them in powdered sugar while still warm. Just great thanks for the recipe!",
