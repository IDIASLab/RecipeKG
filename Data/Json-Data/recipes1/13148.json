The only thing that I did differently was add 3 cups of sugar and 5 eggs. Its not listed on here, but I made a glaze to go along with it. To make the glaze,  you need  1/4 cup of 7 up and a 1/2 cup sugar. Cook in a saucepan until the sugar is dissolved.  While the cake is still warm, take a toothpick and punch holes through out the cake and pour the glaze over the cake. The glaze really made the cake yummy! I plan on making this cake again in the near future!",
