This would also be excellent over grilled shrimp or chicken. Normally I prefer my salsas after they've sat a while and the flavors have blended. This one however I found to be better when freshly made. When I tried it the next day the combination of mint ginger and mango gave it a kind of 'perfumey' flavor which I wasn't as fond of. Personal preference though. I think I would have preferred a little less onion so will cut back the next time I make it. A nice refreshing salsa perfect for a summer cookout.",
