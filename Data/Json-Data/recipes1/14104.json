I up the onion to 2 tbs, I up the garlic to 2 cloves. I decrease the mustard to 1 tbs (I find it makes the dip a little too sharp with 2 tbs) and I add a big dash of hot sauce.  Not a big difference, in the grand scheme of things.\n\nMy Mother-in-Law called me from the grocery store recently because she was having difficulty finding the roasted red peppers. If you do, as well, they're usually located by either the olives and pickles or they're located by the \"fancy\" canned goods (like marinated mushrooms, etc), depending on the store.  \n\nThe only other note is that I can only find a 12oz jar of the roasted red peppers. I usually use most of it (scraping off any charred skin left on the peppers) and just snack on any leftovers while waiting for the dip to come out of the oven. :D",

I prepared the dip in two Pyrex 5 X 7\" dishes and cooked them approximately 25 minutes. I plan on making this for many upcoming parties.",

The sweetness of the roasted peppers compared to the saltiness of the artichokes makes this a completely different dip however.  I added extra garlic, several chopped jalepenos, and about 1/2 c. of parmesan cheese.  The combination of sweet peppers, salty cheese, and spicy jalepenos is extraordinary!",

I had a cheddar/jack mix so I used that and I used 1/2c mayo/1/2c sour cream to cut down on grease and I didnt have dijon mustard so I used Cleveland Stadium mustard (its a brown mustard) and my guests loved it--said it was a definite keeper. Also added a bit of horseradish and only the 7 oz jar of peppers. Served with Frito scoops. So this recipe is not too sensitive--you can substitute and it still turns out as a crowd pleaser. Very easy and quick to make and goes over very well. I quickly patted excess liquid from my roasted peppers to make sure there wasn't too much liquid and it turned out excellent. Definite keeper. Think it would go well served in bread bowl with bread pieces or with cut up pieces of bagel. Very versatile as to type of chip/bread for dipping.",
