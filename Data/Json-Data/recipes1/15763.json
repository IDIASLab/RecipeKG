The second time I made them I did not have any buttermilk in house so I made some buttermilk using milk and vinegar.  The second batch was good but nowhere near as good, or as light and fluffy as the first batch I made with the real buttermilk.  I don't know why they weren't as fluffy but if I have any recommendations to make I would tell you to use the real buttermilk for the best results!  Added fresh blueberries to the buttermilk batter and they were delicious that way as well!  This is so very simple to mix together, that I will never use the packaged pancake mixes again.  When I double this I double all the ingredients except for the salt.  I just love making things from scratch for my family whenever I can and this is just as simple as a boxed mix, but much, much better!!!!! Update!  I added a teaspoon of Vanilla Extract to the batter - took this recipe OVER THE TOP!",

I also think I would cut the baking soda next time to 1/2 teaspn per cup of flour as well.  There's sodium in baking soda.  With the recipe written as it is, I have to give it one star due to the high sodium content.  The recipe as written with the amount of salt plus baking soda makes the pancakes taste like brine.  I couldn't eat it.  I don't mean to be harsh but if anyone tries the recipe as written they will see what I mean.  Next time I will make the adjustments and think it will turn out excellent pancakes.",

No more Bisquick mix for me. :) The batter was very thick for me, so I added a little more buttermilk to make it a little easier to spread, but I think its because my flour was packed down pretty hard, so there was probably more than 1 cup in there. My son loves them - he devoured three and had one without syrup just because he liked the taste so much. He's already scheming about having the 1 leftover pancake for dessert!",
