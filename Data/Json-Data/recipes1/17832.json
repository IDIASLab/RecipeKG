                "reviewBody": "5.26.21 Went to two markets to buy sole, both were sold out, so I decided to use cod.    I think the single thing that makes this fish so special is the fresh crumbs for the breading (made in my mini chopper).  The fish cooked up beautifully, perfectly crisp with a tender breading  which never fell off.  I bought 9 oz of wild-caught cod, cut  it into 8 fish fingers, and that was dinner for two.  Keep that in mind when you see 10 oz for 10 servings on the recipe.  Definitely a very nice dinner served with slaw made with Donna\u2019s Coleslaw Dressing, Louisiana-Style Tartar Sauce (my go-to for tartar sauce), both recipes on this site, and a glass of white wine.  I see a fish sandwich in the not-too-distant future using this recipe.  Thanks for sharing, it was delicious.",
