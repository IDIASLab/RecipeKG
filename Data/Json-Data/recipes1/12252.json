I formed it to fit the muffin cup. I also added brown sugar and cinnamon to the mix. I would think it would be bland without those flavors. I spooned filling in each cup and refrigerated it while we ate dinner.  I baked them as directed and scooped them out into small dessert bowls. I topped it with french vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! My family went nuts over them. Easy to pepare too!",
