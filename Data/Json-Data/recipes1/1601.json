The recipe is confusing as written because it doesn't indicate whether you're supposed to use the white sugar or the brown sugar at particular points in the recipe. So when I made it, I used white sugar both times and 2/3 a cup both times.  I used thawed frozen strawberries and added some of the leftover juice to the strawberry mixture and I suppose this is why my strawberry mixture didn't expand as much as other people's seemed to. I had to add some cream of tartar to help stabilize and give my strawberry mixture some volume.  I also used almonds instead of walnuts because I'm not a walnut fan and almonds seemed to go better with it.   Next time I make this, I would double the crumb mixture to make a more substantial crust in the bottom of the pan. The crumbs sprinkled over top were nice and crispy despite the lack of baking them.",

I used my Kitchen Aid and at the 9 minute mark it was almost coming over the top of the bowl. I was a little worried that it wasn't going to fit in the pan. Once the whipped cream is folded in it is the perfect amount. It may be a little difficult to cut immediately out of the freezer. I decided to let it sit for about 10 min on the counter and it was perfect for us. This will be a repeat here. Thanks for sharing!",
