I just used a box of herb-seasoned Stove Top stuffing and followed the recipe to the letter except I used chicken tenderloins. This probably accounted for the saltiness and next time I would probably use low-salt cream soups. To make the stuffing, I just put the dry mixture into a bowl and added water until it was the consistency that I wanted (very wet). It came together extremely fast and easy. Comfort food. Served with some sauteed green beans with walnuts.",

I always double the recipe (except for the chicken) because I am always left wishing there was extra stuffing and sauce. I often use Stove Top stuffing, and find that the seasoning adds flavor. I also sub mushroom soup for the celery soup, a personal preference. One good hint: I don't put the stuffing on top of the chicken, I put the prepared stuffing on one half of the 9x13 and the chicken/sauce combo on the other. This creates some crispy stuffing, which seems to have better texture when mixed with the chicken after cooking. This way you don't end up with a mushy dish.",
