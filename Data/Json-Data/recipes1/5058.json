The inside remained juicy and full of flavour. I did add a little cinnamon and soysauce to the ingredients. Turned out perfect. This is a keeper!",

I basically followed the directions except I mixed the onions lemon juice and spices all together in a bowl and added olive oil. I put the juiced lemons inside the bird with the apple and celery. I also added a couple cloves of garlic to the inside and outside of the bird. Every hour or so I flipped the chicken over in the pan. It took about 3 1/2 hours to cook it at 350 and turned out great. I offered the juices to the kids but they didn't like them. I thought they were ok but nothing to rave about-glad I didn't thicken it for gravy. I will use this method again for roast chicken.",

Celery onions fresh minced garlic a half a lemon quartered and some cooking sherry in the bottom of the crock. Patted the dried chicken with salt and cracked black pepper. Instead of browning the chicken before cooking I put the chicken in an appropriate sized pan and broiled in the oven (on lowest rack) at 450 degrees AFTER it was done in the slow cooker. If you choose to do this check the chicken after 5 minutes so the skin does not burn. The chicken was wonderful -- moist and flavorful!!!",
