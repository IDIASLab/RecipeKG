We liked this batter very much.  It had a good flavor and covered the fish beautifully.  The only thing we found was that it was a bit flat and didn't bubble out the way we like it.  This was easily remedied by the addition of a tspn of baking soda.  The key to making perfect fried fish is the temperature of the oil.  If it is too hot, the batter will burn and the fish will be undercooked.  If it is too cool, it will take too long to cook and the fish will be greasy.  If it's cooked at the correct temperature (320f), the batter will be golden and crispy and the fish will be cooked through but won't taste greasy.  Effectively, the fish is steamed by the heat of the oil cooking the batter, but should be cooked before the oil actually soaks through the batter, which is why the temperature of the oil is so crucial.  This is a good recipe and definitely reminded us of home.",
