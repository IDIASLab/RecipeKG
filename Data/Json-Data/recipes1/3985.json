I actually cooked it in 20-30 minutes and with the exact amount of milk.  I chose to cook it slowly and watch the temperature to insure the right texture (I tend to burn milk easily).  My only difference is that I doubled the recipe.  If the pasta is sucking up alot of milk you may be using the wrong pasta.  Make sure it is elbows or like.  Also, I used already shredded melting cheese from Kraft.  I did not have a grainy consistency.  I thought this was tasty and easy.  I would make this again without hesitation.",

I also had different cheeses in so I used white cheddar monterey jack swiss gouda and havarti. I've been trying to duplicate Trader Joe's frozen mac & cheese (so creamy and yummy!) which uses a mix of these cheeses and this recipe tastes even better! I stirred the roux while slowly adding the milk and when it was time to add the cheese I added that slowly too (off heat) while stirring like some of the reviewers suggested. I think that really helps keep it smooth and creamy. Also when you add the flour let it cook (while stirring) for about 5 mins or so to cook out the flour taste. I love onion but next time I'll add even less (just personal preference). Thank you for a great easy one-pot recipe!",
