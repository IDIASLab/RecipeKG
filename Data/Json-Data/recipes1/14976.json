I added two lumps of chicken boullion to the water I normally would use to cook the rice. When it was nearly cooked through, I added the chopped onion to the rice cooker, and then a few minutes later I added the mushrooms (I skipped the celery because I didn't have any). The flavor of the rice is great with the mushrooms. I added the parsley and walnuts afterwards. Delicious. I'd make this again, it's healthy, and really improves the taste of boring plain brown rice.
