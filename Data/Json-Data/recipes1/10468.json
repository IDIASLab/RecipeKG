But, I could not, in all good conscience, make this recipe as directed because of the high fat and sugar content. I substituted applesauce for the oil and Egg Beaters for the eggs.  I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup each and used Splenda and Brown Sugar Splenda. I like to be able to serve desserts, but without breaking the bank in terms of calories from sugar and fat. I highly recommend this recipe, but a healthier version of it.",

Other things I snuck in with the pureed carrots: juice of 1/2 orange, 1/2C applesauce, 1/2c grated coconut flakes. Added 1/2 C oatmeal to the flour. Doubled the spices. Threw in 1/2C raisins too. Baked same amount of time (30mins). Turned out perfect bars - moist and cakelike, but held together. Not gummy at all! Top with kefir cheese frosting or cream cheese frosting if regular frosting has too much sugar for you.",
