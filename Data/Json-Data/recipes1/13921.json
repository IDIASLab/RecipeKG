I also added 3/4 cup of walnuts to the oats and baking mixture. Next time I will cut the butter to maybe a 1/3 cup (it's really rich other wise.) Hubby loved it wants me to make it again.",

Tossed them with 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of homemade pie spice blend. For the topping I used 2 cups of baking mix (Bisquick) and half cup of the rolled oats, only 1/4 cup brown sugar and subbed rum extract for vanilla. Used homemade chai-spiced applesauce. Skipped the spices in the topping and chose to add the melted butter into the mix then crumbling it over the apples. Overall, I'd make a few changes. I would use more apples or reduce the topping (1 cup baking mix & 1 cup of rolled oats) leave out the extract and potentially use more applesauce (maybe 1/2 cup). Great served warm with vanilla ice cream.",
