I added a cup of sour cream, increased the sugar by 1/4 cup, and for the crust used two and a half cups of crushed wafers with 1/4 cup butter pressed to the bottom of the cupcake liners.  They turn out great after these changes -- people keep asking for the recipe!  I also made them using the plain wafer cookies for the crust as described in the recipe and they just turned slightly chewy ... it kinda felt weird having to chew the crust when the cheesecake itself just melts in your mouth.  So if you have time, do the extra work and crush your cookies - it's worth the trouble  :D",

Vanilla Wafers have shunk over the years, so I crushed 2-1/2 cups, added 1/4 cup melted margarine and pressed 1 T into each paper liner.  Also as per previous reviewer, I added 1 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup more sugar to the cream cheese mix and got 20 wonderful cups.  Topped 1/2 with 1 T blueberry pie filling and the other 1/2 with 1 T cherry pie filling....blue and red, my kids HS school colors.  First dessert to disappear!!  Thanks for sharing this one Diana.  It's been printed and filed for lots of future use.",

                "reviewBody": "These were easy, fast, and tasted pretty good.  After reading some of the reviews, I changed up some things.  Also, I only had one pkg of cream cheese so I had to adjust the ingredients accordingly.  For the Crust:  The wafer cookies were too small for regular muffin size and too big for mini-muffin size.  So, I crushed 20 wafer cookies and mixed it with 2 tablespoons of melted butter.  After lining the muffin pans with cupcake papers, I put tablespoon full of crushed cookies to each muffin pan.  I had exact amount of crushed cookies for 12 cupcakes.  I used a measuring cup which fit nicely in the muffin pan to press the crushed cookies to the bottom.  Very easy!  For the Filling:  I used one pkg of cream cheese, added 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1 egg and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Filled each cup evenly and baked it for 20 mins.  After it cooled a bit, I put it in the refrigerator to chill.  I read in other reviews that cheese cake cups sink afterwards.  Well, it sinks quite a bit - about 1/2 inch deep, which provides you more than enough room for your favorite filling.  My choice of filling is strawberry (fresh, frozen, or pie filling).  With filling and all, I thought it was little too sweet for my taste.  Next time, I think I will use a little less than 1/2 cup of sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

I used butter cookies instead of vanilla wafers - you MUST try this because I believe the butter cookies (store-bought in the tin) made them even more delicious!\r\n\r\nI brought them to a pot luck and they were a big hit.  Thankfully I made more than enough and had a (very) few left to take home - yum!\r\n\r\nBTW, I used half a strawberry to top each one, slicing each strawberry in half, then slicing each half to make three thin slices, and fanning those for an elegant topping.\r\n",
