The result is a delicious and perfumy sugar that can be used as an ingredient or decoration for baked goods fruit and other desserts. Vanilla beans may be reused in this fashion for up to 6 months.",

We went a little overboard with the melted chocolate... we dipped each cookie until it was half covered!!! We also made our own vanilla sugar: 1/2 cup white sugar 1/4 tsp vanilla extract in a freezer bag. we let the mixture dry while the dough was sitting. The sugar became clumpy so we crushed it back to granulated form. It worked perfectly! Great recipe!",
