This recipe makes a very small batch.  I triple the recipe and use 1/2 cup margarine and 1 cup shortening instead of all shortening.  It seems to make a softer cookie.",

I thought they were pretty good. But unfortunatly I really like a more buttery falvored cookie than these were. I did use butter flavored crisco but it didn't take the lack of butter away. These cookies are nice and soft. I do like having more brown sugar than white sugar I like the flavor better. When I make these again I will probably modify it a bit and add both shortening and butter (only a 1/3 or 1/4 of what it calls for will be butter until I find the right mix for me) this will hopefully give me the butter flavor I like and still keep them softness that I also like. I have now made it with regular crisco the flavor isn't all that. Plus make sure the crisco hasn't be sitting around the house too long that will make the flavor even worse!!!",
