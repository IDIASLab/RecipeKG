I did and made a huge mess on the sheet pan. the dough has a very flaky puff-pastry-like quality to it! instead of rolling it into squares etc. I rolled each half into a rectangle (about 1/2 inch thick) spread on the filling and rolled it up! be sure to grease the pan for they stick easily! this is a fantastic recipe and i highly recommend it! thanks for sharing!:D",
