Be very careful if you do this as marinades used with raw meat need to be boiled for a few minutes (not just brought to a boil) to be safe to eat (because of possible bacteria in raw meat-samonella in the case of chicken.) It is safer to make extra marinade and reserve some to be used as sauce as some reviewers have said they did.  ",

I boiled the leftover marinade for 5 minutes and used it as a sauce. ..added a little cornstarch in water to thicken. I also cooked the chicken in a frying pan because I wasn't confident the chicken would cook under the broiler in 5 minutes and I didn't have time to bake it for 30.  It was great!  The edges carmelized a little from the sugar in the marinade. We ate it with white rice and steamed broccoli.  Thanks for the recipe!",

What flavor we could detect was great...but once you were past the outside of the meat there was zero flavor. I did use breast meat that had the skin removed and they were large.
