Whenever I go home to visit, I usually indulge in some Buffalo chicken wings from a place called Emerson's. They have two flavors of wings; Buffalo-style, and sweet and sour. I came up with what turned out to be a deliciously sticky, ginger and garlic glaze. I really hope you give these a try.",

I also used dried garlic pieces and some ginger powder in the glaze since that's what I had.  I put some extra garlic powder in the flour as well. To make them look great, let the glaze boil and throw the wings in the pan while it boils, a few at a time, so that the glaze coats the wings.  This does not take long - 3 minutes or so. I  also put the wings back in the oven for five minutes to kind of seal the sauce in, but this is really not necessary.  If you do this, you will have Showpiece wings.  I have made these three times now and people raved over them.",

Based on the reviews which said that the recipe is a bit bland I used the following ingredients for the glaze: 5 crushed garlic cloves rather than 3 4 tablespoons of ginger (there was no fresh ginger in the grocery store so I used ginger from the seasonings aisle 3 tablespoons of Asian chili pepper sauce 1/2 cup rice vinegar 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 2 tablespoons soy sauce The recipe says to boil the glaze but I did not. Instead I dipped the cooked wings into the glaze and put them back in the oven for 10 minutes. The glaze came out perfectly. When tasted on it's own the glaze has a strong Asian flavor with just a hint of spice. After the glaze is placed on the wings the glaze is flavorful but not very strong.",

Then I added a ton of garlic powder to the flour when shaking the wings. I generously sprayed the aluminum foil-lined baking sheet with nonstick spray and cooked them for 22 minutes. Then I turned them over and cooked another 22 minutes. I then dipped each wing in the sauce and returned it to the baking sheet and the oven for another 5 minutes. Otherwise these would be overcooked and dry if cooked for an hour. For the sauce I added another clove of garlic and used dried ginger. I decreased the vinegar to 1/3 cup and used regular white vinegar. These changes made the wings spectacular for me and my husband.",
