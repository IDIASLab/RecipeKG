I found that I actually needed more chocolate for the second coating than the first, and needed to reheat it every so often to keep it thin enough to dunk the beans in. It was easier to use two forks to dunk the beans: use one fork to lift the beans out of the chocolate, then use the second fork to almost 'fling' the beans off the first fork individually. That helped prevent any clumping. I used dark chocolate, but I think that milk chocolate would make for a better sweet/bitter balance. And finally: to make the second chocolate coating 'shinier', try melting about 1 tsp of butter alongside the chocolate in the microwave. Great recipe, thank you for sharing it!",
