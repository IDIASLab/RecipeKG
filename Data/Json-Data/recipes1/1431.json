This must have been a WWII recipe when women were working long shifts and needed cake w/o much time consuming labor or rationed ingredients. What took the longest was waiting for the boiled spiced sugar syrup to cool down but you can be preparing dinner during the half hour in the fridge it needs. This is the perfect day-before-payday-and-I-need-something-for-dessert-but-the-cupboard-is-bare recipe. Looking to see what I had available I made it with no raisins peanut oil instead of shortening whole wheat pastry flour instead of white used double-strenth black tea instead of water and 1/2 teaspoon allspice and 1 teaspoon powdered ginger for the spices. (The tea helps the baking soda work as it is a bit acid.) As others have said it is moist dense and delicious. I have to laugh when I see other reviewers using expensive and/ or non-vegan substitutions like butter or serving it w/ ice cream. Kind of misses the point. If you can use that stuff pick another richer cake recipe; it will taste better. However this is quite amazingly good given the limitations.",

I never knew you could make a cake without these ingredients. I changed it a little because of what I had in the house. I did not have any raisins and I used ground clove instead of nutmeg and allspice and doubled the cinnamon. I also used butter instead of shortening. This was the most moist and chewy cake I have ever had! My boyfriend never eats cake he does not like it because he says it is dry; he LOVED this cake!! It tasted like gingerbread! Many of the reviews say how dense it is so I was nervous and thought it was going to somewhat resemble a moist brick (haha) but I am not sure what they mean it is a little dense but also airy like a cake but soft and CHEWY and OH SO GOOD!! I did have to cook it a little longer than 20mins but I will definitely be making his again soon!!!!",

I did add a little bit of rum axtract to the boiled mixture and then sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on top before baking. Other than that I followed the recipe.

And... It was great! It took longer to cook more like 30 minutes but it's a nice change! ESPECIALLY with the cocoa. I really enjoyed the spices and cocoa together.
