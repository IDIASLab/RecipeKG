Having said that this has a more mellow lemon flavor than other similar recipes but is also much richer which I liked since I used it as as the filling for the three layer Rainbow Citrus Cake also from this site. In hindsight I'd add two or three teaspoons of lemon zest for more tartness and flavor but it really was fine as is.",
