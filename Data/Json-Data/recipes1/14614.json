The sweetness overpowered the dish, especially since avocadoes are mild in flavor.  I used the zest from half of the lime, and ended up adding a bit of minced garlic to try to distract from the sweetness and add a level of flavor.  Thanks for the recipe, but I think the 'tomato, avocado and mango salsa' recipe is a bit nicer due to the addition of the tangy tomato.",
