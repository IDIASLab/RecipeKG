So many recipes call for cinnamon or other spices. These just do NOT need that. They come out like a nice soft buttermilk sugar cookie and are a very pretty orange. Delicious! My grandma used to place one pecan in the center of each. Thanks so much for the recipe as I'm not sure I can find my grandma's!",

Also the icing needed WAY more than 1/3 cup of powdered sugar. I would start off with that and add in about 1/2 tbsp of OJ at a time. The consistency is very important - or else you end up with a gorgeous mess all over your cookie sheets. You should also wait until they are cool to ice - just so it does not go cascading down the sides of each cookie. The end result was a soft cakey cookie with a slightly sweet flavor and a wonderful tart icing to really bring it together. YUMMY!",

I added the orange juice and zest into the cookie itself instead of making icing and it was fantastic! I would recommend putting the carrots through a processor and pureeing until they are smooth before putting them into the cookie because if you happen to have a few clumps they make the cookie taste a little doughy even if it is fully cooked. Love the taste of the carrots and orange together. Only changed the recipe to make a healthy cookie intstead of a regular one. Great recipe.",
