So with a ton of small pieces I knew I would also have to change the cooking method. I grilled it in a grill basket instead of broiling. Everything else stayed the same (oh except for the bun in which I used a hoagie because I had them on hand). These were outstanding down to the stuffed jalapeno green olives. Me and the husband both really enjoyed these. The onion/shroom combo went perfect with the marinated beef and cheese. I had the leftover (minus the bun) for lunch today and the beef was still tender. I could be wrong but I think me having the beef sliced prior to dropping it in to marinate helped it absorb the flavor and also made it more tender. This was so much better than a Philly Steak N Cheese in my opinion!",

Also was out of Italian dressing so I made some using Italian dressing Mix (on allrecipes). Shredded the beef up and topped the bread with it then threw it under the broiler for a minute. Also added some provolone cause you can't have to much cheese right? I left out the jalape\u00f1o stuffed olives because I'm a big wimp when it comes to spicy.
