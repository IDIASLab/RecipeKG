Try with it on the side fresh cabbages or lettuce. I'm lebanese and that's the lebanese way of preparing it. Hope u like this recipe and Bon Appetit!!!",

I have made it with red and brown onion instead of the spring onion when I have been out of spring onion and I like the red onion best. I have also found that the olive oil should be reduced to 1/4 cup (for my tastes) and that the bulgar should be soaked in less water to save the mess of draining it - about 1 1/4 cups.  This also keeps it kinda crunchy and prevents it going soggy.  This salad must be well mixed again before serving as the dressing settles to the bottom.  All in all a great recipe.",

This was sooooo good! Thanks for sharing.Our Greek night was a success because of cooks like you! :0)",

Arrange on a platter and garnish with bits of parsley red pepper and green onions and you've got a presentation worthy of any gourmet restaurant. Wonderful recipe Katherine!",
