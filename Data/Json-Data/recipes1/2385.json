The first time I followed the recipe exactly set my bread maker and came back to what looked like breadcrumbs. So I through it out and started again. I used the basic recipe but added cup of orange juice. This really was what the recipe required I had used the pulp of a large orange but there was still not enough liquid. I rolled out the dough and spread 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the top then added the sugar. I used a combination of Cardamom and cinnamon (even using just half the amount of cardamom in the recipe the taste was still quite overpowering) I then finished with raisins in place of the cranberries. Rolled and cut following the recipe. I let rise in the covered oven before storing in the fridge over night. The following morning I removed the rolls from the fridge and left on the counter for 45 minutes to bring to room temperature before baking. I baked for 25 minutes. I did finish off the rolls with the orange cream cheese frosting off this site. Enjoyable rolls once I had made the changes.",

Made the dough last night let it rise overnight and popped it in the oven when I got up. Its hard for me to tell when these types of rolls are done--20 min wasn't enough but I didn't realize until I served and they were doughy. But thats an oven thing I just need to figure out! I was worried they might need some frosting but I think they are sweet enough as is at least for me. Had some difficulty with the dough as it wasn't wet enough. I used two clementines though and had to add about 3/4 cup OJ and milk (didn't think about OJ until I had added 1/2 c of milk--more OJ would've been better). But I think the liquid will always depend on the amount of pulp you can get out of your orange(s). Thanks for the recipe!",

First off, I doubled the recipe and followed it with the exceptions of softening the yeast in  1/4 c. of warm water for five minutes. I also did not add cardamon as I don't care for it.  This turned out like a quick bread.  Extremely hard to knead and roll out, nor did it raise at all.  There was way to much brown sugar. I was very disappointed but I am going to make it again and use 3/4 c. orange juice like another user suggested and so I give it  three stars.",
