Only difference was her recipe had her sprinkle the chocolate chips over the oat layer when it was still hot then go back a few minutes later with a spatula and spread them out. Fun to do and one less bowl to clean. As for the difficulty presenting: she refrigerated them then broke them into pieces sort of like almond bark. One bite and we stopped caring what the heck they looked like anyway.",
