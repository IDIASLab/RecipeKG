By the second day the bread is not so fresh and crunchy but can be easily cut very thin and makes wonderful crispy toast. I am allergic to wheat and baking powder and this is the about the tenth recipe that I have tried and the first and only one so far that has worked - I am new to baking! By the way my second attempt was even better than the first and rose more. I found that it was important to follow the temp guidelines and managed to keep the constant temp during rising by putting the bowl with the dough in an esky (Australian for cooler or picnic or insulated box) with a cup of boling water and thermometer. Temprature and humidity was constant. I am looking for more baking recipes to play with that do not use wheat or baking powder.",

Not only is this bread much cheaper then the store bought spelt but it hold ups much better in a sandwich. This recipe was easy to make (spelt is known to be fussy) I did substitute agave nectar for the sugar to lower the glycemic index since it is being made for a diabetic. One warning I do have for people with allergies is that spelt is a type of wheat better tolerated the most.",
