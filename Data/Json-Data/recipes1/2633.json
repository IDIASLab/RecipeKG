However the listing of ingredients and the directions are so poorly written that the recipe's rating has to be docked for it. The listing of ingredients is out of order and the method incorrect. Novice or beginner bakers will not know that the traditionally recognized method is to cream the sugar and shortening or butter together add the eggs one at a time beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour salt baking powder and baking soda then add to your creamed mixture just until thoroughly mixed. Stir in the oatmeal coconut and walnuts last. (I also added a cup of dried cranberries which was a nice fall addition) I almost forgot to include the white sugar just because the list of ingredients was so out of order and mixed up! Finally I made my cookies larger than called for placed them on UN-greased cookie sheets and still only had to bake them for 12 minutes. I can't imagine how overbaked these would have been if teaspoonful-sized cookies were baked for 15 minutes. The cookies themselves were ok tho' a little on the dry side - I think reducing the flour to 1-1/2 cups would be a good modification to the recipe. I cannot recommend this recipe as written.",
