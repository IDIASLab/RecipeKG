It was still fantastic. Besides the baking time for the fish this recipe took 5-10 minutes to make. Yum.",

The smoked salmon and the taragon ABSOLUTELY make this dish what it is...YUMMY!!",

I smoked the salmon myself and it still only took 30-40 minutes to put everything together. I used angel hair because it was what I had on hand. I used 1T of a combination of herbs instead of just tarragon. I used 2T of lemon juice in the dressing because we really like lemon. And I used broccoli instead of peas. The oil really emulsified as I beat the dressing and made a delicious and easy dish! We will definitely be having this again. One caution: the 2 of us needed all the dressing! I would double the dressing to make the stated 4 servings.",
