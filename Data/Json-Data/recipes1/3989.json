Cooks much quicker and no need to crumble. I'll be making this again and again!",

Add one beaten egg to the pasta right after draining and quickly mix it in. The heat of the pasta will cook the egg, so you won't be eating raw. The egg also helps hold it all together and gives it a slightly creamy-ish texture. Hope this helps!",
