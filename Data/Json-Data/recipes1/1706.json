The only difference is after the punching down and resting step, I then divide the dough into 3 equal size balls.  Roll these balls out into a fairly thin circular shape, use a pizza cutter and cut in 12 equal wedges.  Roll the wedges up from the longer side down to the point, let them double in size, about 40 mins., and then bake as directed.  Because they make so many, I put them in smaller freezer bags after I've baked them.  When I want to use them, simply let them defrost for approximately an hour, place on a lightly greased cookie sheet and bake for about 10 mins. at 300\u00ba.",

What could possibly be better than homemade rolls. I did use regular sweet potatos and not canned. It takes about 3 small ones to equal the 1-1/2cups canned. I too added some brown sugar to the potatos about 2T next time I think I'll add about 1/4cup. My rolls were about the size of normal dinner rolls and so this recipe made 24 good size rolls for me. I would not recommend skipping the step on oiling the pan even if your pan is nonstick. It really needs the oil. This recipe has a wonderful taste. The aroma of the bread rising and baking is out of this world but I think that on all homemade breads. I paired this with Angels Beef Stew recipe.",

My family is avowed sweet potato haters so I didn't tell them what kind of rolls they were scarfing down at Thanksgiving dinner. It was thumbs up all around the table for the soft tasty rolls with none of them realizing they were eating the hated sweet potato. The recipe did require more flour..perhaps as much as a cup. I didn't measure..just added until I had a firm but still sticky dough. Also added 2 T of brown sugar. Used Pam on my hands while forming the rolls so the dough wouldn't stick. They rose perfectly and were gorgeous after they baked. Thanks Sherlie loved this recipe and plan to use it again.",

I too used almost 5 cups of flour instead of 3. If you are short on prep time when you go ingredient shopping substitue \"Rapid Rise\" yeast... Basically you'll mix all your dry ingredients together (including the yeast) and put the margarine in your saucepan with the water as you heat it (using this method you heat the water to 120-130 degrees). In the meantime I pureed my cooked sweet potatoes & the eggs together in my blender. Once your water has reached the proper temp add it to the dry ingredients and then add your blended potato mixture. Once it's all incorporated knead for about 5 minutes then cover for 10 minutes and let rest. Then you're ready to shape your rolls. Of course they need to rise before baking but you've just saved yourself an hour because you didn't have to wait for it to rise the first time then punch down then shape then rise again etc etc. They are quite tasty but \"subtle\" is the word of the day. What this recipe needs is sweet potato concentrate. Hmmm...",

I did add another three cups of flour (1/2 cup of WW) and still had to keep my finger tips floured while pinching off the dough. I got 27 nice sized rolls and a loaf of bread!
