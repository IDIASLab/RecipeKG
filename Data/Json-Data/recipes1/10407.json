I live in Nova Scotia and we are having the worst winter in years here and I havn't been making it to the grocery store as regularly as usual on account of all the snow storms. Therefor I've been on the hunt for recipes that have ingredients in them that I have on hand. I halved this recipe and added quite a bit of onion and garlic powder and s&p. I also added a few dashes of vinegar when I deglazed the pan. I cooked this according to taste as the recipe indicates and the finished product was very delicious. This type of dish is very different from my usual style of cooking but my husband devoured two heaping platefuls and my 4 year old ate her portion too (no small miracle!)My husband said to give this 5 stars and I heartily second that! Thanks Kris for a nice change.",

Wayyyy too much noodles for the other ingredients make this a dry dish and I hesitate to call it a Polish dish. This isn't a real Polish heritage recipe as my Polish parents' cooking and authentic cookbooks NEVER use garlic garlic salt in their cooking. I think Kris may have doctored this herself it's a tasty dish the way she makes it but there are better out there. Two stars only for the effort.",

Fresh or Smoked Kielbasi is a cheaper more flavorful choice or small cubes of Pork butt. Garlic powder is a last resort fresh is best. Slice the cabbage the same width as the noodles being used for faster cooking and easier eating Bowties work well too. Increase butter to 1 stick don't worry you are not eating this every day! and IF really big flavor is desired add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of CARAWAY SEED very traditional. Cook all until golden brown for depth of flavor and Enjoy!",
