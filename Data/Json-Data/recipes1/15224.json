Thanks to all of the reviewers too - I heeded advice and cut back the white sugar to 1/3 cup and brown sugar to 2/3 cup which cut back on the sweetness.

I found that 1/4 cup of sugar in the potato mixture is enough for my family's sweet tooth since the topping adds more sweetness. A secret for those who do not like \"stringy\" sweet potatoes...use a mixer to combine the sweet potatoes and other ingredients.  All the strings from the sweet potatoes wrap around the beaters, so don't scrape them after mixing.",

UPDATE: I read some earlier reviews about the \"sweetness\" of this recipe.  I normally pick out 5 of the largest yams I can find.  Used garnet yams before and used Beauregard yams this last time. It came out the same.  This nukes well and is easily pre-made.  I had enough yams to fill 2 loaf pans almost to the rim, but it came out a little soft (like baby food).  So, in this case, I would have added an extra egg to give it extra firmness.  Last time it was was just enough to fill 2 loaf pans 3/4 full and 2 eggs gave it enough firmness.  Splenda for the yams and brown-sugar splenda for the topping worked well.  ===================  I've been attempting various sweet potato dishes for the last few years from this site because other family members expect some sweet potato dish during Thanksgiving.  They all came out similar to most sweet potato dishes we've tried in the past.  Nothing made us go, \"Hmmmmm....sweet potatoes?\"    I made two alterations to this recipe. I substituted Splenda for the white sugar and I nuked this dish instead of baking it in the oven (there wasn't room due to the turkey).  It is the first time in my home that a dish of sweet potatoes was fought over.  There was little left over and everyone wanted some to take home.    Anyhow, this dish came out creamy (like good mashed potatoes consistency), wasn't overly sweet, and it turned",

I also use 2% milk instead of cream and lite butter. There are really no other ways to cut down the fat or sugar but these tips do save some fat grams.
