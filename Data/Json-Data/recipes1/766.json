I went to a Party City and bought a plastic dipping spoon in the candy-making department....and it makes dipping the balls a MUCH easier process!

I didn't have her recipe and I was so happy to find this on AR. I made these with my niece and we had a ball - no pun intended! I did made a couple of changes to made it hold together better. I used a whole jar of peanut butter (it's a little over 2 cups anyway), kept the butter the same, and reduced the sugar by 1 cup. I melted the peanut butter and butter in the microwave and then mixed everything. I put the peanut butter balls on cookie sheets lined with wax paper and let them chill for a few hours. I then dipped them in chocolate and red and green sprinkles for Xmas. Take one bite of these crunchy, peanuty, chocolatey little treats and you'll want to make these every year too!",

Don't forget to stick toothpicks in the peanutbutter balls before you freeze them. Makes them much easier to dip;)",

Some advice...if you have an old fork you are willing to sacrifice, bend it so that is L shaped. Pour your melted chocolate into a narrow container and dip your pb balls this way. Keep a hot water bath handy if the chocolate starts to thicken. Also, if you tire of dipping in chocolate, another option is to roll in finely chopped pecans or walnuts, or a mixture of cocoa and powdered sugar...or you can just drizzle the chocolate over them in zig zag patern.",

These are really easy to make and they taste delicious. The peanut-batter batter will be a bit dry at first but keep stirring until the icing sugar is fully combined. Definitely use toothpicks to dunk the balls in the chocolate - stick a pick in each ball before they are refrigerated. And you don't need to cover them completely in chocolate - I find that is a bit too rich for most people's taste. Just dip halfway. A scrumptious Christmas treat!",
