The recipe mixed up well and baked beautifully.  I rolled them in a white sugar/maple sugar mix.  I'm the baker at a local Farmer's Market so thought I would bake these for maple season.  I let a co-worker taste one and she could not tell me what type of cookie it was, even with the maple sugar on top.  It makes a delicious brown sugar cookie - but not maple.  Today I did make another batch and added 2 tsps. of maple extract as well and omitted the vanilla.  Tomorrow when I go back into work I'll see if it's better with the addition of the extract (they weren't baked off yet when I left today).  The recipe does have promise!  Followup:  So now I've tasted the cookie with the maple extract and it is a beautiful cookie!  The extract absolutely makes all the difference.  I will make these cookies again but only with the addition of the maple extract.",

She was researching the state of New Hampshire and found that maple syrup was one of their state's products. She had to provide a 'taste' of this for 150 students and teachers. I loved the idea of the 'maple glaze'(from another reviewer on the site) to \"finish\" off the presentation of the cookie. We actually liked the cookies as a family with or without the glaze. It was an incredible \"hit\" with EVERYONE (all asked for second helpings!) and a teacher asked me for the recipe. I will definitely make this recipe a 'regular' in our family's list of favorite cookies! Thanks Craig!!!!",
