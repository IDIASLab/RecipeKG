Should you boil it turn the heat off let it sit an hour to thicken??? So it became a big soupy mess that even 1.5 cups of parmesan cheese couldn't solve. It was a big soupy mess with 2 cups of liquid in the bowl! I looked up a recipe and it says to use HEAVY CREAM (it'll turn out much thicker not soupy) and it says what to do with your burners as well. F- is my rating for this recipe. I usually like all recipes but I don't agree with the positive reviews here!!",

                "reviewBody": "This is a basic recipe which in my opinion must be tweaked. What I did was 4 1/2 tablespoons of butter as stated. While it was melting I added one clove of garlic which I grated on a zester. I also added one teaspoon of hot red pepper flakes. I let this cook in the melting butter. I then added the flour but it was not enough. Ended up with 3 1/2 table spoons of flour. Then added the milk (actually used one percent) After whisking and cooking for a while added the cheese. At least a cup (I was grating right into the sauce) Added much needed salt and pepper. (taste after the cheese because parm is salty) It came out wonderful and after I poured this on the fettuccine I added fresh parsley. Ok it was dried. Raining so didnt want to go pick it. The sauce had just enough bite. Next time I am going to add chicken and broccoli. Maybe Ill try olive oil instead of butter. Definitly a winner.",

I followed one suggestion and sauteed the garlic and red pepper flakes before adding an extra bit of olive oil and the flour and making the roux. Then I added the butter (I used soy margarine) and stirred and then the milk (I used skim) and stirred. I brought the mixture just to a boil (and as suggested watch it carefully! milk boils fast!) to incorporate the oil (beforehand the oil had been floating on top...) before adding the Parmesan (and I used plain ol' powdered Kraft in the can and I'm not sure I even had 1/2 C). I tasted as I went and the red pepper flakes gave it a lovely zing so I omitted the hot sauce. Mine was more grainy than \"velvety\" (probably because of the powdered Parm) but it thickened nicely. I used it over 2 packages of fresh ravioli broccoli flowerettes and salad shrimp. Lovely!",

I only added 6 ounces (which equated to 98cents worth of the stuff) of the crab and whala!  He had so much that his stomach began to hurt, lol:).  Thanks Jane!!  Just a quick note, this was the most inexpensive dish I've ever made and it is so sought after by adults when you 'go out'.  This one is a keeper.",
