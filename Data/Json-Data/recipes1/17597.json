I tweaked the recipe each time and this is my recommendations:\n1. use 1 can of coconut milk, not 2. Using 2 totally dilutes the flavors. \n2. I add 2 kafir lime leaves, for an authentic Thai flavor. \n3. Instead of straining the broth, I use a large infuser ball and keep the garlic, ginger, lime leaves and lemon grass inside,and keep it in the finished soup product so the soup gets as much kick as possible. \n4. For a one pot cooking method, I sautee mushrooms in the oil, add fish sauce, and then add the broth/infuser ball (with garlic, ginger, lemon grass and lime leaves). After adding the broth, I added an entire boneless chicken leg/thigh and let it cook in the broth. After chicken is cooked, I removed it, shredded it and added it back to the pot. Then I added 1 can of coconut milk, curry paste, lime juice. Finish by garnishing with red onions, cilantro, jalapeno slices and lime wedge garnish.",

There is something missing from the recipe, in step #5 it says to add the lime juice, but nowhere in the ingredients is lime juice listed other then the limes for garnishment.  I used 2 tablespoons because I found another thai recipe similiar to this one and that's what it called for.  Other then that, I followed this recipe to a T, and it was wonderful.  Although, next time I would like a little more heat and will use serrano peppers instead of jalapenos.  Also, this is a light soup recipe, and if your looking to make it more hearty try using basmati rice or glass noodle with it.  They are both great.  Thanks for sharing, will be using this often.",

I went to 3 stores before finding the red curry paste and it really didn't add much spice. I would substitute ground red pepper and use a lot of it as the coconut milk neutralizes spice. I used 3 chicken breasts and added 2 fresh tomatoes sliced at the end of the cooking. The fresh limes and fresh cilantro are an absolute must. Oh yeah the fish sauce is disgusting so just use a little salt. Serve with jasmine rice or rice noodles. This soup is every bit as good as what I have had in restaurants in Hawaii Key West and Miami. The first time I tried it I reported to my mom that I just had the most awakening soup that tasted of chicken lime and milk. Bizarre but it totally works.",

They both said it tasted \"restaurant worthy\". I am not an experienced chef so I like recipes that aren't too complicated. This recipe is not complicated but I do recommend watching the video as I found it very helpful to watch the steps being performed. The grocery store I went to didn't have fresh lemon grass so I bought the minced lemon grass that is sold in a tube. One tube equals 6 lemon grass stalks so I squeezed half of the tube into the chicken broth. It was perfect and I doubt I'll use fresh lemon stalk in the future. Also I used 3/4 teaspoon red curry paste and the soup was not spicy at all. When I cook it just for me and my husband I will kick it up a notch. Thank you for sharing such an awesome recipe!

I made this soup last Sunday and will make it many times again in the future. The only thing I changed was adding twice the red chili paste like other reviewers sliced shiitake mushrooms more broth and cooked longer because I wanted the red onions softer. It was a challenge trimming the fat off the chicken thighs but worth the flavor and moistness breasts do not give. I appreciated Chef John's tip straining out the ginger lemon grass garlic cooking in chunks and using the lite and regular coconut milk. I served it with 1/4 cup basmati rice. This was so tasty it was gone in two days. I am making Chef John's gumbo today. Go Colts!!!!",

                "reviewBody": "I had some problems with the recipe. First despite using less chicken than recommended I ended up needing to add extra broth as there wasn't enough liquid. Second even with the extra broth it was almost impossible to skim the top of fat as my spoon kept running into chicken pieces and vegetables. Third I really think the chicken should be more seasoned on its own either with some kind of marinade or rub or at least in the skillet with salt and pepper. Finally I wonder if maybe the garlic lemongrass and ginger should stay in the soup rather than being discarded. The soup I ended up with was very bland other than the jalapeno slices and they were just random heat since they were put in at the end as garnish. I will admit I did not use the cilantro as I strongly dislike it. This is the second \"spicy\" \"Thai\" soup I've made from Allrecipes that has been bland. I have a few others to try but I'm thinking I might have to make up my own recipe.",
