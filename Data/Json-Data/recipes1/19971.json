I used reduced fat cream cheese low fat mayonnaise I upped the garlic powder to a half teaspoon and because the recipe didn't specify what kind of onion to use I used chopped green onion as I had some to use up. I made this early this morning and let it set until lunch when I had this with carrot chips and sliced cucumbers. I've not had anything like it before! Next time I might add just a little more onion but really that's just personal taste. I think this would be good with dill weed too.",
