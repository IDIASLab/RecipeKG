I do not like to use shortening in anything.  Also, it uses less butter/fat than other recipes, but the cookies still taste great.  This is a classic snickerdoodle recipe and I always get rave reviews when I make them.  For those who said the cookies didn\u2019t bake well, I think the problem may have been your oven or the ingredients and not the recipe, because these always turn out perfectly for me. They are simple and fast to make and I almost always have the necessary ingredients in my kitchen.",
