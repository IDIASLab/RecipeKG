For ease I substituted diced tomatoes for whole peeled tomatoes, added 1/2 cup of white wine, 1/2 tsp of oregano and cut back on the red pepper flakes to 3/4 tsp, brought the mixture to a boil, and then simmered until the sauce thickened and reduced down, around 30 - 40 minutes.  Added the shrimp and scallops to the sauce the last 5 minutes and let the heat cook the seafood (saves an additional pot to clean).  Any type of seafood, mussels, clams, etc., would do well in this dish.  Prior to serving stir in Italian parsley (flat leaf parsley) and 3 tbsp of fresh basil.  Buon Apetito!",

I recommend the following minor modifications: fresh roma tomatos, not canned--(Blech!) a half cup of diced red pepper strips while sauteing the garlic.  Then a dash of half and half and capers at the end to thicken and give depth and body.  Finally, I grate fresh parmeasean and black pepper at serving time.  This made it much better in my family's opinion.  Sorry, no photos, the diners ate it before I could get out the camera.  They nearly ate it right from the pot on the stove! I served with white bean salad and a bottle of chianti and a hot loaf of foccachia with olive oil and fresh canollis for dolche! ",

I'd suggest adding a smaller amount of the crushed red pepper flakes to start tasting it & then adding the amount that you (& your family) would prefer. You can always add more seasoning as needed but if it's too much the recipe could be ruined. Also I just added the scallops & defrosted shrimp to the sauce at the end without cooking them in olive oil first. I served the dish over half a lb. of whole wheat angel hair pasta. Next time I'm going to try adding some red wine to the sauce for a little extra flavor.",

I made the following changes/additions which made it a 5 star so I averaged it out and gave it 4! Here are the additions/differences: I put all 4 TBL of olive oil in the saucepan with 6-8 cloves of garlic(depending on size) but instead of crushing I used a garlic press and just minced it. I also cut up a red bell pepper in strips and saut\u00e9ed with the garlic. I used 2 14.5oz cans of diced tomatoes with basil garlic oregano in it. I added 1 TBL of the \"Itallian Herb\" herb paste that you can buy in the produce section and 1/4 cup of a Carbernet/Merlot mixed Red Wine but I am sure any Red wine would be fine. 1 tsp of red pepper flakes was right on for my taste but if you fear heat you might want to add less to begin with. I simmered it more like 45 minutes. Instead of sauteing the seafood I just added it to the sauce with 10 minutes left in the simmering. This sauce is very liquidy and I liked it that way but if you want it thicker I would advise using less tomato juice or simmering longer. I think next time I might use fresh Campari Tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes.",
