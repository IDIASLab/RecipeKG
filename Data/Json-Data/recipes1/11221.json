I did brown the onion and meat - and used about 2 cups of French cut frozen green beans - came out just fantastic - will use again and again!!! For us - this dish must be served with warm crusty bread!!! Melt in your mouth comfort food - great for our 12 degree night here!",

I read all the reviews and ended up using 2 cans of diced tomatoes (seasoned w/ garlic & basil)in place of the tomato sauce and 1 C. of beef stock in place of the water. Also I used frozen green beans because I had those on hand. It turned out delicious... kind of a \"stoup\" as Rachel Ray would say... a cross between a stew and a soup. I served this w/ couscous... very yummy! Next time I think I'd serve some Feta cheese on the side to sprinkle on top... oh and don't leave out the mint. It makes the dish (IMO):)",
