The only difference is that they also serve it with some shredded carrots and chopped red onion which I added.

First time I made this, I only used 1 cucumber so I used 1/8 cup each of sugar and vinegar.  Then I made with 2 cucmbers with 1/4 cup each of sugar and vinegar and both time came out great.  I think the taste settles and is better if you could wait 15-30 minutes before serving.  But not too long!  I took some left over for lunch to see if this can be my next pot luck dish but unless you like very soft cumcumber, it wasn't good as fresh crunchy one...  I guess I have to separate the cucumbers and the dressing until the last minute or I might keep the cucumber skin on and see how it holds.  Anyways, it was delicious!",

Even cutting back on the sugar (I used Splenda) and vinegar this was still a little too sweet and tangy for me. The peanuts didn't appeal to me so I omitted them and I do admit that may have compromised the ultimate intent of this recipe both in flavor as well as contrasts in textures. Still it's a good salad we had no problem eating and I liked the additions of the cilantro and jalapeno which not only pepped the flavor up but made this a very pretty salad as well.",

I think it might be helpful for the cucumbers to be sliced into strips in order for the flavor of the cucumber to be infused with the strong cilantro-vinegar dressing. Also it's crucial to use fresh jalapenos - the canned ones just won't cut it. We actually ate this with turkey tacos and they were good!",
