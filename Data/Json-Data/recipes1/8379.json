Stir in 1 cup butterscotch chips until melted.  When cool enough so marshmallows don't melt, mix in 1 small bag of coloured marshmallows (227 gr.).  Turn into greased 9\"x9\" pan.  Cool and cut into 1\" bars.  Always the first thing to go at our bake sales! HINT:  Sprinkle coloured marshmallows around bars when serving.",

I guess I'm an old fashioned cook but I like my flavors to compliment eachother and this \"snack\" was the exact opposite from what I desire. My husband put it perfectly when he said that you could take a spoonful of each ingredient eat them simultaneously and that would be your outcome. I thought it was disgustingly sweet and I honestly had to brush my teeth after eating them! I do not recommend this one sorry.",
