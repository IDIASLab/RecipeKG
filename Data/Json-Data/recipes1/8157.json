At first I decided to follow the recipe exactly but I was afraid that people would bite into nothing but pizza sauce. I removed the combo and placed in a blender and got a pretty tasty sauce. I added the ingredients on top. The biggest recommendation that I have is to not completely cover with mozzarella cheese...just lighly sprinkle instead. This is because once the cheese cooled it formed a hard layer on top that was hard to dip. As much as i love cheese it's best to keep it spread out where it doesn't clump together. I baked garlic bread and sliced into cubes for dipping which was really tasty.",
