Also I didn't have any rum extract so I used 5 tablespoons of white rum. It goes brilliantly without any icing and just a bit of nutmeg sprinkled over and even with Rum Flavoured Icing (from this site). I've still got more dough in my fridge to bake I'm saving it up to bake closer to Christmas! Also I believe those who complained about the cookies not being like eggnog were commenting on Millie's opinion...she felt they tasted like eggnog to her... and perhaps some of you'll disagree but the cookies are NOT eggnog cookies they're RUM COOKIES and do complete justice to it! Thanks a million for sharing Millie these will be on my cookie platter this year and for all the years to come!!:D",
