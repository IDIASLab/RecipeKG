Well I was so disappointed. After following the recipe exactly I had a well beautiful but tasteless cake. I had bought a store mix cake for backup and I'm glad I did. My mother-in-law made me let her taste it and she agreed it was a nice presentation and said it was moist but no taste whatsoever. I recommend if you like coconut flavor perhaps use more coconut and coconut milk.",

I made it again this time using coconut milk (thanks to another reviewer's suggestion)in place of milk. I also added one half teasp. of salt to the flour mix. Then I used dessicated coconut in place of the soggy stuff. The result was a delicious coconut cake very moist and delightfully gooey. Next time I will use margarine instead of butter as the butter made it a bit rich. Well work making again with the changes.",

This not really a cake for beginners unless you're just lucky;-) I think that the the bakers who could not get the cake out of the pan simply did not let it bake long enough. The cake is done when it is golden brown. It should not be the color of coconut custard pie! Take the cake out ot the oven and let it sweat in the pan for 6 minutes. THEN remove it carefully and sit it on a rack to cool. Good luck! Recipe variation: I did add a little baking soda ( 1/2 tsp) only 2 tsp baking powder and I used dried buttermilk. I also used a 'right smart amount' of shorting and flour in my pans instead of spray.",
