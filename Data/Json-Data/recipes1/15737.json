I had about 1/2 a roasted red pepper left in the fridge and that was plenty for my sandwich. I do not have a panini press so used my cast iron grill pan and weighted it down to mash the sandwich and leave the bread nice and crispy and well marked. Great sandwich a hearty and very filling meal. Love the addition of the avocado. Thanks Amanda.",
