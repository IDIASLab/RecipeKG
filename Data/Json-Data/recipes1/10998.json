In any case I used 2/3 c each water and sugar the vanilla and I cooked the coconut in syrup until the whole of it was at soft ball. I also beat it a little much - be careful about that; stop while it's still a little drippy or it will be crumbly later. The result? It was delicious but it made about 20 square inches. Hmmm. I think I'll try and get my hands on some non-sweetened coconut next time.",
