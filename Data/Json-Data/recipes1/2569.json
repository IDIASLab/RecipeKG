So, work fast once you bring the dough out from the fridge and if it gets too warm, put it back into fridge until it firms/hardens up.  Then after making the pies, put them into the fridge for 10 minutes or so to make them firm again before frying.  I\u2019m thinking the only reason anyone should have any problems with this recipe is that the dough got too warm to work with.  Hope this helps everyone that is having problems.",

After I fried the pies I drained them on paper towels and generously coated them with powdered sugar. Last night they were crispy warm and yummy. This morning they were even better! I was very pleased to discover that when I placed the cooled pies in the fridge in a foil covered place this morning they were still flaky and delicious! Wonderful recipe!!!",
