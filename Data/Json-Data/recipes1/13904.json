The result was so wonderful you might want to make the same \"mistake!\"  I committed cardinal sin #1 when it comes to baking and didn't read through the recipe carefully before I began.  Since in most cases you'll make a cake with all ingredients at room temperature, I measured out the cream and set it out with the  eggs.  When I set out to make the recipe I noticed it directed that the cream was to be whipped before adding in the flour, and that wasn't about to happen with it at room temp!  But I wasn't about to start from the beginning either by re-chilling the cream. So... I took a chance and beat the eggs with the sugar for a few minutes to aerate the mixture, then added the dry ingredients alternately with the (unwhipped)cream. I baked it in the 8\" layer cake pans as directed, but I wasn't comfortable with the baking temperature of 375 degrees, so I lowered it to the more traditional 350 and baked the layers about 23 minutes.  I watched it rise nicely and perfectly as it was baking and I was encouraged.  I turned the cake out from the pans and it was stilll perfect. Frosted it with \"French Silk Frosting\" (although a vanilla buttercream would have been nice too), cut myself a slice and was wowed.  The cake has an open and tender crumb, fluffy (almost dainty in its lightness!) and is very moist.  Because it's flavored with just a little vanilla it would be compatible with just about any frosting. Very pleased!",

I followed the recipe exactly and frosted with mocha cream(from this site). It came out fabulous! I made sure not to over beat the batter, and was a bit worried about its texture. It was a bit grainy when I poured in the cake moulds. DOn't worry, it comes out just perfect after baking! Light, fluffy, yet full of flavor. My mother even said it tasted similar to great pound cake. One reviewer said that it tastes like whipped cream? I agree! My brother who is usually very difficult to please, called me at home after I had left their house, to tell me that he had just had a piece, and loooooved it! He also said he would pay at least $40 for it! And he never calls me to tell me he likes something, so that must mean something!\nThanks for that great recipe, outstanding!",

I was so impressed with the flavor and texture (very crumbly and light) for a recipe that is so simple I didn't quite expect it to taste so good. I made an icing with butter icing sugar heavy cream and vanilla that went wonderfully but a word of caution the cake is very sweet so a dab of icing will do. Would go great with any fruit as well. Update: Sorry I have to change my review and the # of stars. This was awsome as soon as it cooled but after even 2 hours later it completely dried out even after being wraped. I have never had a cake do that in such a short time very strange. For that reason I will not be making it again.",
