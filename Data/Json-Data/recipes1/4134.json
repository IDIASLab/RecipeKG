The proportion of onions to tomato in a true amatriciana is about 1 tomato per 3 onions and her recipe called for neither basil nor chili peppers but did use a sprinkle of nutmeg. Also you should use the bacon grease to cook in rather than draining it and using the olive oil for the best flavor (though this recipe as written is healthier than using the bacon grease). As other reviewers have noticed amatriciana isn't really a sauce but is clumpy. You can puree it but traditionally it is clumpy. Don't expect it to taste like a 'regular' spaghetti sauce or you will be disappointed - amatriciana is a totally different dish and when done well is quite delightful.",

I picked this recipe without giving it much thought so I could at least use my own sauce on what I thought was going to be spaghetti. I'm glad I didn't read the ingredients more closely or I would have been afraid to try out something different at the last minute (the name deceived me thinking it would be a marinara-type sauce). It isn't very saucy but I made sure to mix it up well and added a little olive oil to the pasta to coat before I added it. I also cooked up some italian sausage and put that in with it and it turned out great! Everyone went back for seconds. I will definitely make this again!",
