I also had leftover chicken that I cut up and mixed in with all the other ingredients.  I did not follow other reviewers suggestions and use less water - 2 cups was perfect, but it does need to cook longer.  I cooked for 30 minutes at 350 covered with foil, turned the temp up to 400 and uncovered for 20-30 minutes, and it turned out perfect.  The seasoning packet (from the rice) makes this very tasty, although a little strong.  Would definitely make this again.",
