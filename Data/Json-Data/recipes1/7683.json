Using a whole packet is way too much! Half would be better. Dry or fresh dill, either works well. I'll make this again with the above changes. The recipe, as is, is just much too strong and salty and greasy, and the bread does nothing for it.",

Used Good Season's italian dressing mix - the normal kind. Used about 1/2 of it - kept tasting until I was satisfied. Sliced the cucumber very thin. Sprinkled fresh dill on top didn't use any dried. Used the amount of mayo recommended in the recipe otherwise I think the mixture would have been way too thick. Mixed the spread the night before - I recommend this the flavors were even better the next day. My guests loved these and so did I! They will be a party standard from now on.",

Next time I'll serve separately using a decorative bowl with a butter knife so people can spread on the crackers or bread themselves.",
