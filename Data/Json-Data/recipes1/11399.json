I have made it for the last 7 Christmases once I got the recipe out of my mother-in-law: ) Hers was very specific stating 52 ritz crackers and if Vidalia Onions aren't in season add sugar to the onions while sauteing them. I am a big fan of sweetening the onions so do it even when the Vidalia onions are in season. I also make it 1-2 days ahead and just reheat the day of to free oven space (the microwave even works...gasp!). Enjoy!",

Excellent as a wedge served with crispy crunchy salad for a vegetarian meal or with crisp bacon and salad for meat eaters.",
