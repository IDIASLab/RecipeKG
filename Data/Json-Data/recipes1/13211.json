CORRECTION is needed for the ingredients list. It says to use a 64 oz bottle of pineapple juice...but it should be listed as 46 oz of juice. The ratio should be 3 parts juice to 1 part coconut rum. I made this with 46 oz juice and 1.5 cups coconut rum so we would have a low alchohol drink for our occasional drinkers/social drinkers. If you are making this for a \"party\" crowd go ahead and use the 3:1 ratio which would be 46 oz juice and 2 cups coconut rum. For hard-core drinkers just leave the cocunut rum bottle out and they can pour extra rum into their drink. Delicious!",
