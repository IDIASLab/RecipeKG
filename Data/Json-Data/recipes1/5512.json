I used 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1 tbs brown sugar, and 1 clove chopped garlic, as suggested by others, and used white wine since I had no red wine on hand, and cooked the salmon on the George Foreman grill in 10 minutes. This was so easy and tasty that I made it again the next day, and since I was coming home from work and the gym, I needed a quick and healthy dinner, so I seasoned the salmon in a bowl, using pre-minced garlic out of a jar, and didn't bother marinating the salmon for hours, but just put the salmon in aluminum foil and spooned some of the marinade on top, closed the foil and put it in the oven 20 min at 350 degrees. Made instant brown rice which I cooked with frozen veggies for a side dish...very little mess to clean up...same great taste. This is a keeper.  THANKS!",

It might be because I didn't charbroil the salmon I used packaged salmon from Trader Joe's that comes in a re-sealable plastic bag that you use to marinade and cook the fish in. It was super easy to make this way but next time I will try grilling it and adding more wine and less soy sauce to the marinade.",
