While looking for a new appetizer recipe I found this one and was thinking that those herbs don't sound like they would be good with peaches... so of course I had to try it. Wow! I did have to make some changes because I live in the middle of nowhere and wanted to make it for a dinner party tomorrow night. First I think the nearest \"herbs de Provence\" are in a Wegman's a 4 hour round trip from here. so.... I had to make my own with some fresh herbs from my garden and a few dried ones that I had. I didn't have any savory nor do they carry it at our local grocery so that was left out. I do have Celtic Sea Salt. I don't know how far I would have to go for burrata cheese but was able to get some marscapone locally. Luckily farms are abundant here so I was able to get some really good peaches and I always have turbinado sugar. Anyway. Wow. Every bite is a great experience. Just... the salt with the sweet cheese... and then you get a hint of lavender from the herbs. Wow. Try it. Even if you have to modify it like I did you'll love it. Can't wait to serve it tomorrow at the birthday/dinner party.",
