Surely a poundage or a volumetric measurement would help more!\n\nThe simmering mixture turned out needing more vinegar and more sugar in adjustment, my guess being that there was too much tomato from misguessing. That said, I tried my best to get it to a nice outcome but the final product tasted like there was an ingredient missing somewhat.\n\nStill it was a pretty decent, if fussy outcome.",
