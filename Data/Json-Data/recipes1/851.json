I couldnt believe how great tasting it was. Usually I find pound cakes a bit dry or have to much butter taste--this didnt. I made the following substitutions: I used orange extract (we were out of lemon) in the following measures: 1 tablespoon and another 1 teaspoon of orange flavor extract and one tsp.of almond extract and 1tsp of butter extract. I used a french vanilla cake mix-we had it on hand. I used half regular sour cream and half fat free-because both were leftover and I didn't have anything else on hand. I made sure I did not use a pudding mix cake mix or a butter recipe cake mix -sometimes these can come out oily and don't rise when you use substitutions (at least that has been my luck anyway). I used a spice cake mix and half a tbsp of Orange and another half tablespoons Jamaican rum flavour and it came out great. For those with oily or fallen cakes make sure to use just under a cup of oil and just under a cup of sour cream. Be sure to beat exactly the full four minutes but not over or it will fall. Be sure the cake doesn't look shiny in spots or its not done.",
