As an experienced pastry chef I assure you the fats are interchangeable and using whichever you have on hand is fine. In addition before rolling if you'd like to avoid the refrigeration process simply wet your hands with cold water and briefly knead the dough with the extra moisture. The dough readily comes together and I repeat this process when re-rolling the leftover dough.",

I might make the spice measurements heaping the next time I try them. I baked them up to make ice cream sandwiches to store in the freezer. I use about a fourth of a cup non fat vanilla frozen yogurt spread between two of these cookies then wrap each one in plastic wrap and store a batch of them in a plastic freezer bag. They make a great low calorie treat.",

I did roll my cutouts a little thicker so I only got 21 cookies. \"Paper thin\" was too hard to peel off the rolling mat. For that yield I don't know if I would make them again hence the 4 stars. I made these according to the recipe but mixed the dry ingredients together and then mixed that in with a hand mixer until the dough looked crumbly. After that I used my hands to squeeze the dough together. I don't recommend this recipe for beginners. I did chill the dough overnight. It was a little sticky to work with. Baking parchment worked well instead of greasing. The dough tastes terrible raw but is really good when baked. Kitchen smells heavenly.",
