                "reviewBody": "This is very easy to make, as promised, and is not \"bad\", but is kind of bland \"as is\".  I can make the following suggestions:  first, double the amount of eggs stated from 4 to 8.  \"Eight is enough!\"  (Ok, I'm sorry, that was cheesy.)  :)  Speaking of cheese - use sharp cheddar, more than what she recommends (a cup, also, doesn't appear to be substantial enough) and don't add it until maybe the last 20-25 minutes or so.  If you leave it on the entire time it gets really dry and too crispy, almost burned in places.  You want it to be nice and melty, not dried out.  Thirdly - more is needed to give the dish some oomph.  I would recommend doing any of the following:  tossing in some chopped green pepper to the onion/mushroom mixture, adding some Tabasco sauce to the egg mixture, or topping with pepperjack cheese instead of cheddar (and again - only during the last 20 minutes!).\r\n\r\nI made this dish for an Easter brunch with my husband and my parents - all ate their portions, but they all gave me suggestions as to how this could be better the second time around.\r\n\r\nI also have to say that using Oscar Meyer pre-cooked bacon saves LOADS of time and doesn't leave your whole house smelling of bacon grease!  My parents also suggested that you could use ground sausage, spicy or non-spicy, or perhaps some cubed ham (as other members have suggested) instead of the bacon.\r\n\r\nI hope my suggestions have helped!  Again, this is not a bad recipe, just needs some tweeking.",

I layer per directions and noticed my top was cooking faster than the bottom.  By the end, the top was beyond done while the bottom was somewhat mushy.  It still had a good taste and the second time I made it, I mixed it all together.  Solidified better and blended well.  I also added sauted green bell peppers, used sharp cheddar cheese, 1 tsp dry mustard, 1 cup of chopped ham and 6 eggs instead of 4.  Second time was a charm.",

Mix all of liquid ingredients well and pour over top. Liquid should cover potatoes. I baked in 7 x 11 glass casserole dish. A smaller pan will also keep it from getting too dry. 375 for 45 min then top with French's Onions last few minutes of baking time. Great Mother Day brunch!",

I used thick-sliced pepper bacon which I cut into 1-inch pieces before cooking so the bacon could be evenly distributed. Be sure to drain fat between frying batches of bacon so your bacon will be crispy. To save time I used an 8-oz. package of sliced fresh mushrooms. I also deleted the 1Tablespoon of butter used to saut\u00e9 the onions and mushrooms and cooked them in 1 Tablespoon of bacon grease. I increased the eggs to 6. I did cover and refrigerate overnight. My casserole was cooked in 45 minutes. Thanks Pam for sharing! I will definitely cook again.",

It was so easy with most of the prep done the night before so I was able to spend the morning with my family instead of in the kitchen. I used more eggs than the recipe called for (I used 6 or 8... I can't remember because it was a couple of months ago) and I omitted the mushrooms because we don't care for them. The only thing I would do differently next time is use less salt (maybe eliminate the plain salt and only use the garlic salt and maybe a little seasoned salt)- it was plenty salty with the bacon. Really almost too salty. But still good! I will definitely make this again! Oh it was very good leftover too!",
