I cut all the coating ingredients in half except for the garlic and the parmesan cheese (I grate mine fresh, and recommend that!).  Since I had cut down the butter, I brushed the garlic butter onto the chicken with a pastry brush rather than dipping the chicken into the butter.  There was a ton of coating mix leftover, so after I drizzled the leftover garlic butter onto the chicken as recommended, I then dumped some of the remaining coating on top of the chicken when it was already in the pan.  I baked it for about 40 minutes.  It was really fantastic - made the whole house smell delicious - it was moist and really flavorful.  My kids both loved it.  I will definitely make this again.  I can only imagine that if it is made with the skin on the chicken, it is probably incredible.  But it worked extremely well prepared as above.",

I baked my chicken at 375 for 35 minutes and it was done perfectly - moist and juicy, not dry at all with a wonderful crispy coating.",

The only thing I did differently from the recipe is I set the oven to 375 degrees, I put the breasts in about 15 minutes before the other pieces so the smaller pieces didn't get overdone and I used a jelly roll pan instead of a 13 X 9 pan to promote crispiness.  The chicken was VERY crispy and juicy.  Loved it!!",

I could not help but think while I was eating this, (this sure beats all the oil and fat that I would be eating if this was my normal deep fried chicken and on top of that this is really crunchy and Gooood!!!). I used Italian bread crumbs and I used chicken wings. If you do not like or can not have a lot of salt cut the amount in half, then sprinkle a little bit on after dipping into the butter, I used seasoning salt. I double dipped my chicken because I had so much breading left over and hate to waste. Then poured\nremaining butter mixture over chicken then baked.

I substituted crushed cornflakes.I eliminated the melted butter and instead, spread the chicken with a mixture of dijon and mayo. Then carefully patted on the cornflake, cheese and parsley mixture.Place in the greased pan then dropped small bits of butter onto each breast. Wow! The dijon/mayo really zipped up this recipe!

I added some saltine cracker bits to the breading for a little extra crunch. I also did chicken strips so it only took about 30 mins. Tossed some leftover alfredo and marinara sauce in a pan added some canned mushrooms. Threw it all on top of some vermicelli noodles and voi la! An awesome dinner. Thank you so much!
