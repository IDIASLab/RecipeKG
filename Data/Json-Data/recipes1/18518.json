We mixed the pie filling in my Kitchen Aid mixer it was less than five minutes to make it. We followed the recipe exact. This pie was done baking at five minutes before the fourty minutes was up. Gorgeous pie VERY VERY good. This recipe's a keeper. NOTE: For those of you who want a pie that tastes like pumpkin that's lightly sweetened this one is for you.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is excellent as is.  Here are some helpful tips: 1) cover the edges of the pie crust with foil and pre-bake it in the oven until it's half way cooked so that the crust does not get soggy and cooks through all the way. 2) heat the pumpkin on the stove with the spices. This gets rid of the canned taste, lets some of the excess water evaporate and gives the spices a richer taste. 3) let the cooked pumpkin rest for a few minutes and then incorporate the condensed milk into the warm pumpkin.  Allow that to cool and then add in the beaten eggs. This will give the pie a creamy consistency.  4) add the filling into the pie crust and leave the foil in place over the edges of the pie.  Bake at 350.  About halfway through baking, remove the foil to brown the edges. Bake for 30-35 mins total and then turn off the oven to let the pie cool in the oven. This will prevent the filling from cracking.",
