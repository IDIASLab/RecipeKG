It's forgiving-but careful about too many capers and and barely salt the chicken because the capers make everything super salty.  I added extra olive oil and butter to the saucepan and added ground garlic and a few flakes of red pepper to simmer awhile.  Didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried.  I served this over penne since I didn't have linquine or spaghetti.  While the pasta drained, I added about 1/3 cup of olive oil to the pasta pot, a half a stick of butter, more garlic granules and about a cup of chicken broth--heated to boiling and tossed the cooked pasta back into it. Put in serving dish, then placed the chicken and all the sauce from the pan over the pasta and topped the pasta and chicken with some grated parmesan cheese.  I have never made a piccata I liked as much as this one and my husband and I inhaled it.  YUM.",

I added a little bit of Panko breadcrumbs to the flour to give it some crunch, and because I'm counting calories & fat, used less EVOO to brown the chicken in the pan and finished it off by baking in the oven after spraying the chicken with some olive oil Pam. (I wanted to have some flavor from the chicken in the pan before de-glazing & making the sauce!)  Also used Smart Balance Spread instead of butter. My wine was a light and fruity Pinot.  This was outstanding on whole wheat angel hair pasta and despite taking some healthy shortcuts, tasted like I was cheating on my healthy eating plan!  Thanks for sharing!  :-)",

I had chicken defrosting at home, so I started the video showing the preparation.  It looked so easy, so I decided to give it a go.\n\nWow, we were surprised.  From such a simple base, add a rich-seeming sauce and this chicken was delightful.  A simple, tart flavour went very well with our rice and steamed vegetables.  My wife is counting calories, so she was initially concerned, but we dodged that bullet by drizzling the sauce over the chicken, rather than finishing it in the thickened sauce.\n\nVery pleased with how easy and tasty this recipe was.",

Chef John, I love all your recipes - easy AND delicious!  For those who say too sharp or lemony, you just missed the whole point of a piccata.  If you don't like the lemon, don't make a piccata and complain.  By definition, it is supposed to be sharp and lemony (piccata=point of a spear).  Most small children would not care for this recipe as it is supposed to be prepared.  Generally it is for mature and educated palates, I would say.",
