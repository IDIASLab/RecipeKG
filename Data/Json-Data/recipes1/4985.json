I stayed with a young host family and this is one of the recipes they gave me at the end of the trip. This is totally authentic and an amazing recipe. When I went to Spain I highly disliked soups of all kinds. When I came back I was in love with soups. This recipe is one of the ones that turned me from a soup hater to a soup lover. Also do not use any yellow cheese. Authentically it is a white soft processed cheese the texture and consistancy of cream cheese though I am not actually sure if that is the type of cheese used. When made properly the flavor of the cheese is barely noticed.",

It is a creamy but not heavy soup with a nice not over powering flavor. I served it with croutons sprinkled on top. No one even touched crackers with this one.",
