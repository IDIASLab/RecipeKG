And do NOT--as some other reviewers have suggested--mix up the flour/sugar mixture with the fruit before adding the fruit to the pie shell. The reason you want copious amounts of sugar both on the bottom and on the top of the fruit (rather than mixed amongst it) is that while baking, the bubbling-hot sugar carmelizes in contact with the bottom and top crusts, a process which makes the crusts rather crispy in the final product. If you mix the sugar up with the fruit, you don't get that crispy crust, and the large amount of water in the rhubarb will definitely make the bottom crust sodden. Don't worry: the sugar makes its way through the fruit anyway, so you won't have parts of the pie too sweet and other parts too tart.",

I used Pie Crust I from this site.\nUpdate 5/20/07\nI won the rhubarb pie contest and the $100 prize again yesterday with this recipe.  Since I made a 10 inch pie, I used 5 cups rhubarb, 1 2/3 cups sugar, 7 1/2 T flour, and 1 T butter.  I added 3 drops red food color to the sugar.  This pie is definitely a winner!",

You still get that tart zip of the rhubarb that I love!  I also added some cinnamon to the sugar mixture..just because I love that flavor. Make sure to put some of the sugar mixture on the bottom like the recipe states.  This forms a layer under the rhubarb while baking, so that the crust doesn't get soggy.  My dad said that this pie tastes almost identical to the one his Mom used to make.  That alone will make me use this recipe over and over again! Thanks",

Did 2 of these today, but next time I'll do 3 or 4 on one day.  SUPER RECIPE, THANKS!",
