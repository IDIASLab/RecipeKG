While searching for something other than the same ole same ole I happened across this recipe and decided to give it a whirl. Overall this recipe is wonderful. It not only has a good flavor but it also ends up being a very beautiful dish to look at. In fact my husband and I almost didn't eat it because it was too pretty. If you are accustomed to spices in your food I would recommend adding a healthy dose to this recipe. While the flavor of the chicken and peppers is tasty for those of us that love spicy food - it needs a little something more. I used an orange pepper instead of yellow and I served it over a bed of no-yolk wide egg noodles with a splash of butter and salt. It was delicious! I'll definitely be making this one again - with LOTS of spices.",

The first problem I encountered was that this recipe did not provide adequate time to fully cook the chicken.  Simply browning the chicken leaves it raw.  The second problem is that fully cooking the chicken will cause the breading to burn.  My solution was to follow the recipe as written, but then add all the ingredients together and simmer them on low heat covered for 5 minutes.  This allowed the chicken to cook throughly.  The flavour was alright, but it did not taste good the next day and since I live alone I like being able to enjoy the leftovers.",
