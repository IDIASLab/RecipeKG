I recommend 1.5-2 lbs rather than the one the recipe calls for.  Also, fry it up (at least a little) before putting it in the casserole, or else you will just have big balls of sausage rather than smaller pieces.\r\n\r\n2.) After all ingredients are placed in the dish, top with a jar of your favorite spaghetti sauce (this gives a little flavor and also some dipping sauce.)\r\n\r\n3.) Slice potatoes very thin, and above all, COOK FOR 1.5 HOURS, NOT JUST 1 (this ensures sausage is cooked all the way and also potatoes are not crunchy)!!\r\n\r\n4.) Serve with cheese sprinkled on top.  Rolls or croussants go well also.\r\n\r\nThis dish was amazing once I did all of this stuff.  Otherwise it was bland and dry.",

I followed another poster s advice and used hot sausage and spaghetti sauce too. I did not have time to bake this for almost two hours so I saut\u00e9ed sausage and onions and cooked the sliced potatoes in the microwave until tender. All ingredients were fully cooked when I assembled the casserole. I added sliced mozzarella cheese to the top and cooked at 350 for half an hour. It was wonderful. I decided not to put the corn in (didn t think it would taste right) but opted to use it as a side dish with salt pepper butter and oregano. I got lots of raves about both!",

I used all of my mozzarella on a separate appetizer the night before and only had monterey jack but it was still tasty! And I used the recommendations of the spaghetti sauce the browning the sausage and onions as well as cooking the potatoes prior to assembling the casserole. A previous reviewer made mention of the corn side dish with oregano. I love fresh oregano!!! I took that suggestion and it was a nice side dish that complemented the meal quite nicely. As an afterthought it seemed like the newly created sauce with the spaghetti sauce sausage onions and etc really had a promising start for a good lasagna sauce! I'll have to tweak that a bit and see what I come up with. Thank you for all of the previous reviews.",

Only thing I would do different next time is use fresh tomatoes with fresh roasted green chiles (I always have some in the freezer) instead of the canned. With the green chiles in this the flavor was wonderful. Be sure to slice the onions thin so they will cook. My family loved it. Topped with a little sour cream also.",
