I'm not sure if I will make this one again (ONLY because I have my own version) but if I did I would use a different noodle. The angel hair was very difficult to serve...I'd rather use rotini or bow tie. Overall very good with my changes.",

The longer it sets in the fridge the better as the ranch flavor soaks into the pasta. I've also made it sans shrimp as quick and easy side dish for BBQ'd or grilled meat. A couple of times I substituted cold chicken for the shrimp (a great way to use up leftover chicken) and that's also delicious. Spring is here and I'm getting a hankering for this salad again so time to stock up on the angel hair pasta and ranch dressing!",
