Next time I will roll in garlic olive oil and wrap in the bacon.  Depending on the size of your potatoes you might need more bacon.  I did par boil my potatoes - cooled and then wrapped them in bacon.  They can be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator.   They are a bit fiddley to assemble - but easy and fast to grill.  Keep your eye on them though so they don't go up in flames!   *** Yes, these can be done in the oven.   Might make for a tasty appetizer.",

Just too many for the grill.\nI used baby golden potatoes that I poked with a fork after washing. and placed in a large zip lock back with vandalia onion dressing, fresh ground pepper, a splash of evoo and let sit overnight in the fridge.\nI wrapped the potatoes with thick cut bacon (tucked the ends on the underside) from GFS (my fav) in the morning and again placed back in the fridge until I was ready to bake.  This helped the bacon to set around the potatoe nicely without using toothpicks.  I baked them at 400 for about 45 minutes and they were perfect.  I served with a side bowl of 'Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce\"\nNext time I might sprinkle with some finely shredded cheddar cheese at the very end of baking, or maybe try these with a bit of brown sugar sprinked on top when rolling up, and just before placing back in the fridge.\nAs I said, this is just one of those recipes that whatever you do, it will be great tasting, and make you look like a wonder in the kitchen!",

It also took longer to grill than 20-30 minutes... more like 40 minnutes they were placed on a veggie grill tray rather than directly on the grill. Hard to turn with toothpicks.
