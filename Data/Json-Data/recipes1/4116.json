The addition of a few tablespoons chopped fresh parsley and fresh basil take this straight to the top of our favorite recipes list. We are now perfectly pleased with the recipe.",

It was far too salty and \"clammy\" (don't get me wrong i LOVE clams it's just that the entire dish tasted like clams.) I think i'll make this again but modify it severly! Like not adding olives (they were big time yuck!) and adding chicken broth or vegetable broth or white wine instead of half or the majority of the clam juice. I used tiger prawns instead of salad shrimp and i'm glad i did. I also added scallops and maybe next time i'll add muscles or crab. Also i wouldn't mix the pasta and the sauce.
