I aslo used the Hershey caramel kisses (20 of them) and ended up cooking them the 6 mins. at the beginning (same as called for) and about 28 mins. for the second portion.

Some of the other pictures looked like their brownies were made from a different recipe! My market didn't carry toffee baking bits so I used a Skor candy bar that I finely chopped which worked well and added a tasty crunch. I also cut the Rolos in half as others suggested pushing the cut side down into the dough. I have a tip for those having trouble spreading this thick dough into the pan: if you use the back of a plastic spoon or a plastic (not rubber) spatula it doesn't stick to the dough as much. Also cutting the brownies with a plastic knife works much better than a metal knife. This recipe is definitely a keeper!",

Also as stated by so many other's this batter is rediculous to try and spread even with Pam on your spatula! I made these last night and I have decided that they are a bad rip off of better than sex cake!
