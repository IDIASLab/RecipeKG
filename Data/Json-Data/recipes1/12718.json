It comes out delicious every time works just as well with fresh fruit as with canned and I even tried it with a jar of cherry preserves and it was great! If you make this people will think you know how to cook even if you don't. I also like to sprinkle granulated sugar over the top about 10 minutes before it comes out of the oven. Watch out for spilled fruit syrup on the oven bottom though-- either scale down your recipe to fit your pie pan or protect your oven with tinfoil.",

It is VERY easy to adjust the size simply double or triple everything except your butter the butter is merely portioned for the size of the pan. also if you reduce the butter too much you will lose that slightly crispy buttery edge that is so much a part of this recipe(the butter is SUPPOSED to puddle up a little around the edge when the batter is added ) If you're looking for a low fat low calorie recipe this wont be it & trying to make it so wont result in a good dessert but if you want to splurge a little now & then give it a try! Finally aside from ice cream nearly everyone I serve prefers this warm with a little milk poured over the top.",

I used 4 15 oz cans of peaches in heavy syrup, drained the syrup off of 2 cans but not the other two.  Used 2 sticks of real butter melted and mixed in with the peaches, and poured the flour/sugar/milk mixture over all, but poured heavier around the edges as suggested by another reviewer.  I was not real clear on the bottom/top oven rack thing, so I actually placed my middle rack in the lowest position, and left the top rack in the highest position.  I baked it on the lowest rack for about 20 minutes or so, until it had started to 'set up' and just started to brown a little.  Then I took it out and sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar over the top and placed it back in the oven on the top rack.  I baked it until it set up pretty good (about another 20-25 minutes)  I actually used the toothpick test in the dough (crust) on top and it came out clean (thought it might not because of the nature of the *moist* crust, but it did)  Took this to work today and served warm with vanilla ice-cream everyone loved it (even one girl who doesn't even like peaches said SHE liked it!)   If you like peach cobbler, PLEASE try this!!!  YUMMO and EASY too!!!!!",

Pour batter in pan with butter don't mix then pour fruit don't mix crust will rise to the top during baking.

The first time I baked this dish I used Fruit Cocktail (only canned fruit I had on hand) and it was surprisingly good. Tonight I stopped by the grocer's on the way home and picked up a can of sliced peaches and a can of sliced mangos. It was wonderful! I cooked it about 5 minutes longer than stated in the recipe. It seems runny when first removed from the oven but firms up as it cools. Great recipe!",
