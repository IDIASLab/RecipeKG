The first ones came out perfectly - at 25 minutes I wasn't sure they were done, but took them out anyway, figuring if they didn't set up I could bake the next ones longer.  They tasted great after cooling and chilling, so I made the bigger batch the next day exactly the same - only difference was I used foil cupcake liners instead of paper - and they were full of cracks after 25 min!  The next pan I checked at 15 min, and some of them were already starting to crack so I took them out.  So beware, if you try the foil liners, they cook MUCH faster - but they do look a little nicer (the ones that didn't crack!) since the liner doesn't get all soggy looking.  Oh, and I left out the lemon zest because I didn't have fresh lemons on hand, and didn't want too strong a lemon flavor.  Yummy, thanks for a great recipe!",

We are on a diet and we would eat a whole cheesecake if I made one. lol This was definitely the right recipie though! I tried this one because it has a graham cracker crust instead of the vanila wafer crust used in other similar recipies. They tasted just wonderful. It was easy to control portion size so we didnt go too crazy on the calories but we still got to eat some very tasty cheesecake. It was a very elegant presentation too. After they were cooled in the pan, I ran a thin knife around the edge and they came out easy. I served them graham cracker crust side up and drizzled on some sugar free strawberry glaze. My husband got his favorite desert to make him happy and we didnt have to completely wreck our diet to do it. I cant recomend this recipie enough if you want a delicious and  authentic cheesecake taste in managable portion size.",

I used some gold foil lined cup cake holders and some in paper liners.  The foil lined was easier to peel away from the cheesecakes.  Several of mine cracked on the top but covered with the delicious Strawberry Supreme Topping and crushed graham crackers.  Will definitely put this in my dessert rotation.",

I made a sour cream topping for these - Mixed 4 ounces sour cream with 3T sugar and 1 t vanilla extract.

This adds a creamy layer on top that puts this cheesecake into the DIVINE category.",

I should have picked the zest out - that would have saved these. Had I wanted a lemon dessert I would have made one. If you do not want a STRONG lemon flavor I recommend you stop right here and find another recipe. I will not make again as written. UPDATE: I had to try these again without the lemon. I eliminated the lemon juice and the zest and increased the vanilla extract to 1/2tsp and these were wonderful! With these adjustments they were actually 'mini cheesecakes'!",

I don't like using Nilla Wafers as a crust since they get soggy so this is so much better. Watch them as they cook as every oven is different. They will be puffy and slightly jiggly when ready. As they cool they sink down in the middle and allow for toppings! A wonderful base for a million creative options. some i've tried... 1) mix in a cup of mini chocolate chips into batter. when cooled drizzle chocolate or caramel on top. 2) after cooled microwave 1/2 C of seedless raspberry jam for 25 seconds stir and top. melt white chocolate and drizzle on top of that. 3) use canned cherry OR blueberry pie filling. 4) use Oreo crumbs instead of graham.

I read a few reviews before hand but I didn't change anything on the recipe besides I didn't put the lemon zest in. I didn't read all the reviews so someone may have already mentioned this but when I cook a cheesecake I put a pan of water on the bottom rack. I did that with these. I also learned that you NEVER want to open the oven door because for whatever reason that is what causes the cracks. So I used the pan of water on the bottom and didn't open the door for 25 minutes and they turned out gorgeous. No cracks and beautiful appearance. Thanks for sharing!",
