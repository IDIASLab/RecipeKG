I followed the ingredients exactly and only changed the process (I did not use a double boiler - just used a pot and stirred the whole time - tempering the eggs and adding them at the appropriate time.) I took the pie to a party and everyone liked it. My custard did weep a bit and the meringue shrunk and wept (although it was touching all around) so it was not pretty - but tasted good!",
