It is relatively quick to make quicker than the recipe actually says as some of the prep can go on while other things are cooking. You can also save time by sauteing the carrots along with the potatoes after the potatoes are almost done. The potatoes really make the recipe good as they blend into the gravy mixture making it thick and hearty. I highly recommend (though I think that 1 tablespoon of turmeric is sufficient).",
