I had enough filling for two regular pie shells but spread chocolate chips in the bottom of each shell first as they tend to sink anyway. I also omitted the bourbon and soaked the walnuts in a little vanilla flavoring instead. 35 minutes seemed to be plenty of baking time. I have had problems using recipes for this pie in the past where I had problems with the pie setting up and not being too runny. That just seems to be a general problem with this pie; it was a bit runny with this recipe too. Perhaps it needed to be baked longer? However it tasted delicious!",

Because I was making multiple pies I sprinkled the chocolate chips and nuts on the bottom of each pie then poured the corn syrup mixture over each. Otherwise it s difficult to get even amounts of chips and nuts in each pie. If you are making one pie that wouldn t matter. I m not sure it wouldn t be better to cream the butter and sugar together first. I will try that next time. The pies freeze well when baked in advance. I received many compliments last year. We will see how we do this year when the derby day arrives.",

I ended up with one pie that was chocolate heavy and one pie that was walnut heavy.  Otherwise, this recipe worked out perfectly.",
