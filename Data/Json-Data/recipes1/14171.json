This was delicious though a little over the top on the butter; would cut that in 1/2 next time. I cooked the rices in the broth on the stovetop for 45 minutes then transferred it to a small covered baking dish with the rest of the ingredients I used and baked for another 30 minutes. Probably could have used another 15 minutes on the wild rice. We enjoyed it though; it was a very nice accompaniment to the Grilled Pork Chops with Balsamic Carmelized Onions and Pan Fried Asparagus we had tonight. Thank you Corwynn!",

As with the other reviews I found it took much longer to cook and 29 oz. of chicken stock was too much. I'd cut that back to at least 24 oz. I will also cut back on the butter next time and substitute in some Z-Trim which I shoud have done this time reading the one review. What I did when all was said and done and I wanted more flavor was sprinkle on some parmesan cheese. That made it really tasty I thought. I'll bake some in next time and make the other adjustments mentioned.",

I cooked the wild rice (40 minutes) in chicken broth with butter and salt one afternoon.

I then put it in a casserole dish into a 375 degree F oven for 30 minutes. I needed to add a bit more liquid at this point. This was a BIG hit at the potluck dinner!!!",
