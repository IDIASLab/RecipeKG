I used the whole 32 oz. container and added more whole pecans than indicated as I love nuts!  These are wonderful and I recommend to anyone, even those who typically don't like fruitcake!  I did use dried cranberries soaked in Brandy as I didn't have raisins nor bourbon!  The taste is exceptional!",
