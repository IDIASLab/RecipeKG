If you do not smush bubbles you will not get a good pocket! I used an electric fry pan @400 degrees as alternate cooking method (from another review thank you!). I used 100 degree oven to rise dough for 2 hours. Browning was faster using electric pan than times in instructions - went by browning color. Flavor so good I put a little butter in one and had for a yummy snack!",

I guess I just had to watch someone else make them before giving it another shot. Thanks from the bottom of my heart. This is now my go-to recipe from now on.

It spreads the air through the sealed pita and really helps with that pocket.\n\nAs for the pro-bakers, that works, but grilling it just gives it that to die for flavor that you just can't get any other way!",

It took me 15 minutes to knead the dough and I used about 2 table spoon flour which I sprinkled on my kneading board. All the pitas puffed and formed pocket. Since I don't portion equally, I noted pockets of the thinner bread is more fragile than the thicker bread. I suggest if you want to form good pocket for filling, make a thicker bread. But if you want to serve as taco shell, make a thinner bread. I had it for my brunch to go with mayo and fish. Fold it up, just like soft taco. Yum....yum.",

But, the flavor is great! People, if yours aren't puffing up, it's not that big of a deal. Cut your pitas into halves, and then run a paring knife down the middle of the insides, being careful not to cut through to the outside. I haven't had a wasted pita yet by doing it this way. Just go slow and be careful with your knife.",

                "reviewBody": "I love bread. Lately I've been loving flat breads, andy I've been trying to eat less sugar, so I was happy to try this recipe and stop having to buy pita bread every week. Watching the included video is extremely helpful. I folowed the recipe, and used my kitchen aid with the dough hook and my pita turned out perfect. I'm using this as a starter recipe and will probably make changes depending on my mood. But will definitely make this as is again.  In a lot of the reviews I noticed people have been having trouble getting the poof, and I think rolling the dough thinner might help with that.  My son was \"helping\" me and the ones he rolled out were a bit on the thicker side and although they tasted delicious, they didn't poof and i have to cut a pocket in. Once he wandered off, I rolled the dough to be thinner and they all proofed! Best pita ever.",
