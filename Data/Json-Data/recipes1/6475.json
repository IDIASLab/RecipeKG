I made some minor adjustments: 1)I added in a clove of garlic as another reviewer recommended- it was strong at 1st but great the next day just right. 2)Secondly after tasting the salad I felt it was too \"vinegary \" (like another reviewer found it to be) so I added in another tbsp or 2 of oil & some more OJ (about 2-3 tbsps). An alternative would be to cut back on the vinegar to begin w/ to about 1/2 the amount. 3)The recipe says to stir in the spinach onion & oranges right before serving but the next day after having sat in the dressing the salad tasted sensational- MUCH better! The 1st day I would have given it 3-4 stars but the second day I'd give it 5! The spinach leaves & rice really soak up the flavor. This is definitely a salad that's better to make the night before serving. I also added in some diced cooked chicken breast I had leftover from the night before & made it into a whole meal. That was delicious! I've submitted a photo of this recipe. Hope they approve it & post it.",
