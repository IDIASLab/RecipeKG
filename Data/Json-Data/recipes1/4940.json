Although it takes longer, I roast my chicken the day before, shred the meat and then make my stock with the bones. I placed my vegies into a clean pot with oil and sauteed. I then added flour to make a roux, so that I wouldn't have to thicken later on. After simmering the stew I made my own dumplings using buttermilk and eggs mixed together and then folded the liquid into the self rising flour. The folding process kept the dumplings light and airy. Just before I placed the dumplings into the stew I added my meat back in. This was so comforting and the gang absolutely loved it on yet another snowy N.J. spring? day. Thank you Karena!",

Instead of using canned stock, I made my own by adding water enough to cover the chicken in the pot. I also added a few whole peeled potatoes, some peeled carrots, a whole peeled onion and a few pieces of whole peeled celery. When my stock was done I disgarded the veggies (I just don't think they belong in chicken and dumplings, but they give an EXCELLENT flavor). Then I went on making my stew as directed. \n\nI also made one mistake, which was my own fault of course. Instead of making my own dumplings I bought frozen ones, something I will never do again..nothing like making your own (smile)\n\nThank you",

                "reviewBody": "FINALLY a good chicken & dumplings recipe! This is the 4th one I tried. I was let down by the shortcut recipes that use canned soups and biscuits. My family loved this recipe. I cut the recipe down to 8 servings. I used chicken thighs with the bones and skin because it really adds good flavor. I followed the recipe except I did not have fresh parsley so I used dried. The conversion rate is for every 3 teaspoons of fresh herbs you will use 1 teaspoon dry. One reviewer said the dumplings were dry. I made several size dumplings and found if too large the middles tend to be dry. The perfect size seemed to be a spoonful about the size of a small walnut. My family loves dumplings so I made extra. The dumplings use the broth so the more dumplings the less broth left for your gravy. Next time I will use more broth to start. At this point you will take out the dumplings and chicken. I pulled apart my chicken removed the bones and skin and returned the chicken to the pot. When it says to press out the veggie liquid that means to strain your juices with a strainer then press the onions and celery in the strainer so you don t have large hunks in your gravy but still have the juices and flavor from them then dispose of the remnants from the strainer. The recipe did not designate how much flour to add to thicken the broth to gravy. I just went a tablespoon at a time and whisked it in and waited a minute and repeated till it thickened up.",
