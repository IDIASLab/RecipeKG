I\u2019d recommend melting your butter, then add the flour, and whisk and cook over medium heat for about 2 minutes, eliminating the raw flour taste.  Next, add your milk, salt and pepper, and stir until smooth and thickened. I scaled this down to 4 servings, which then called for 25 crackers.  I looked at the size of my casserole dish, knew that would be W-A-A-A-Y too many crackers, so I used 12 and would do that again, maybe even cut back to 10.  And I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about toasting your crackers in butter in a saute pan.  I know next time I\u2019ll just mix the melted butter with the cracker crumbs, and sprinkle on top of the onions.  The butter-cracker crumbs will toast while you\u2019re cooking the onions in the oven, and you\u2019ll save yourself a dirty pan to wash.",
