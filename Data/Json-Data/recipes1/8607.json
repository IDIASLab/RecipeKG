(chuckle) I didn't even notice until AFTER I made these that the calorie/fat info was for 24 servings...so if you take that into account I don't really think these are that low fat! I put this recipe into a program that figures fat and calories etc. from ingredients and I cut them into 9 brownies and they were over 6 grams of fat per brownie! To me the taste--while fine though \"weird\" according to my husband--was not worth that much fat to me. I would rather have a smaller REAL brownie than this one. It was fun making something new though. And I used prunes because I like to make the recipe as stated at least the first time. Like I said the taste was good but they are not as low fat as they appeared to be at first. 24 servings! Can YOU cut that small of a pan into 24 brownies? That would be more like a bite to me than a serving.",

Not quite like typical brownies made from a standard mix or from scratch, but for low-fat brownies I don't think you could do any better than these! They were fudgey, dense (in a good way), rich, and very satisfying. I baked them the full 30 minutes and found that this way the \"edge\" pieces have a bit of a crunch to them that some people like. Otherwise, they cooked very evenly and didn't seem at all overdone.  I, too, used egg substitute (1/2 cup) in place of the eggs to cut the fat a bit more. I couldn't find baby food prunes so I used plums and apples (Gerber brand). The brownies didn't taste fruity or in any way odd for using the baby food.  I don't see how a person could get 24 brownies out of this recipe, though. I used an 8x8 inch pan and cut them into 9 hearty-sized brownies, which makes the nutritional analysis about 3 grams of fat per brownie.",

I tried another variation adding 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips and they were fabulous too (but the fat content went up of course)!
