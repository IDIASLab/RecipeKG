My Aunt served it with white rice and chicken gravy. We popped our meat off the skewers onto the rice and filled it with gravy. What a meal! She usually served a green salad and her famous pumpkin cake. \nThis recipe says to cook on the stove, but my aunt cooked it in a 350 degree oven for an hour after browned on the stove. Either way, this recipe is to die for! \nThank you, thank you, thank you...tastes of home are always great comfort food!",
