The only flaw with this recipe is that it didn't produce enough tuna mixture to fill 4 muffins (8 halves). I ended up only doing 3 muffins (6 halves). I also used a cheddar-jack (cheddar and monterey jack) cheese instead of just cheddar. I love the celery concept because I'm just not a big fan of raw onions! The tomato is also a nice touch. Highly recommend for a quick snack or easy lunch!",
