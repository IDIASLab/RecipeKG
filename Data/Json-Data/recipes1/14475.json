Buy the fresh rosemary, it's worth it!  \n\nI used chicken breasts since that's what we prefer.  I halved them lengthwise like large chicken tenders.  I mixed everything up as directed in step 2 but I baked the seasoned potatoes for 30 minutes then added the chicken to the same pan for the last 30 minutes.  Since I was using smaller pieces and white chicken,  I didn't want the chicken to dry out by cooking for an entire hour.  \n\nIt was PERFECT!  The chicken provided some extra juices that made the potatoes to die for.  \n\nI'll be making this again soon.  We all loved it!",

I also used fresh garlic (about 4 gloves) and fresh rosemary but dried oregano.  I marinated the meat and potatoes together for an hour before cooking.  The chicken was beautiful-wonderful flavor and juicy inside, cripsy out.  The potatoes I cut into wedges and they were lovely as well.  Perhaps some fresh lemon juice on them would add a little kick?  This one is a keeper!  And the fresh rosemary is definitely worth it!",

I did what others had suggested and drained the oil after an hour of baking, and then cooked it for another 15 minutes.  I just eyeballed the seasonings to my taste and found the potatoes did need a little more salt when they had finished.  They were fabulous though-- crispy on the outside as others had said, and soft on the inside.  The chicken crisped up perfectly, though may have been a tad dry after cooking for an hour fifteen.  Next time,I will likely pull it out after the first hour.  Overall, super!",

Brined them for 45 minutes in 2 quarts of water with 1/4 cup each of table salt & sugar (if you do this, be sure to rinse the chicken well after brining!).  Used Yukon Gold potatoes & chunked them up rather than quartering them.  And, I think most important, I DID NOT cover the dish while baking it.  I thought that covering would definintely impact how crispy everything would get.  It sure couldn't have been easier, but I think next time I'll use fresh garlic, because the garlic taste was minimal.  Smelled great while it was roasting!  Thanks for the post!",

I used a generous amount of all the spices and then some.  The potatoes tasted great but my boneless, skinless chicken breast....not so much.  I'm trying to make healthier dishes.  I did put the chicken about 30 minutes later.  It wasn't dry... just lacked in flavor still.",
