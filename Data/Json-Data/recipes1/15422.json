I sprinkled Italian seasoning over the cheese before baking. The directions were perfect starting with a cold oven and then baking exactly 30 minutes. Other than playing around with the toppings the only change I plan to make next time (this weekend!!!) is to coat the dough all over VERY well with olive oil and sprinkle some cornmeal in the bottom of my pan. Thanks for the recipe I will use it often for a quick lunch or weekend meal!",

I only used 1 cup of reduced fat cheese on each one and I used turkey pepperoni to cut back on some fat. I added 1/2 lb of cooked sausage to each one. This would be good with any of your favorite pizza toppings. Next time I'm going to add ham and banana peppers. The kids are wanting me to fix this again next week! Yummy!",

I did not have the RapidRise yeast but did have Fleischmann's BreadMachine Yeast which says on the label it's \"also ideal for all RapidRise Recipes\". Since this was a Fleichmann's recipe I took their own advice. I guess it worked. I didn't have a deep-dish pie plate so I chose to use a 10\" springform pan and it worked beautifully. Since you can take the sides off it made cutting it easier. Well (olive) oiled hands made spreading the dough into the well oiled pan a breeze. I chose to mix my dough in a separate bowl. I did find that the crust was a little doughy while the cheese was perfectly brown next time I'll bake it on the lower middle rack.",

This recipe was pretty good and VERY fast! I do suggest adding some seasonings to the dough. It's very plain. Usually I add some garlic bread seasonings (from Costco) to my regular recipe. I added a tablespoon or two when I doubled this recipe and it still tasted bland. I'll add several more next time or maybe some granulated garlic since it's pretty strong and some basil and oregano. Otherwise, the dough worked out very well. I do suggest using olive oil to oil the pans really well so the crust doesn't stick. I did this and it worked like a charm! I also followed the suggestion of adding some cornmeal to each pan. I topped the pizzas with hamburger, onions, mushrooms and ham and with just plain cheese and pepperoni. Both were great. For the speed of this recipe, I highly recommend it.",
