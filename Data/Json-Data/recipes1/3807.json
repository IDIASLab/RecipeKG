I added 2 teaspoons of dried parsley and 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano with the tomatoes. After turning off the heat I added some fresh snipped chives.

I used a yellow red bell pepper instead of red because that's what I had. I didn't have fresh basil so I used basil in a tube (it's semi-fresh & has worked in every recipe I have tried it in...it's available in the produce department). I also didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried adding it a couple of minutes before I added the clams & basil. I added a splash of white wine (about 1/2 c.) when I added the tomatoes & used 12 oz. linguine instead of fettucine. I thought it was just perfect but to accomodate my husband next time I will decrease the pasta even more. All the accompaniments it needed was a glass of wine a fresh salad & a croissant.",
