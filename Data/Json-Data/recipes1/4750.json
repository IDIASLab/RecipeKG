I sauteed the mushrooms and onion first (I used shallots and added a couple shots of Worcestershire sauce) then removed that from the pan and set it aside while I cooked the chicken (I used turkey cutlets) which I had dredged in flour before sauteeing.  Once nicely browned I removed the meat and deglazed the pan with all those wonderful browned bits with chicken broth and white wine. I let that reduce to about half its volume, then swirled in a few pats of butter.  I served the cutlets over fresh sauteed spinach, topped them with the mushroom/shallot mixture, then poured that luscious sauce over it all.  Loved it.",

I followed the general flow of the recipe but I added: lightly floured the chicken breasts before saute - then sprinkled the paprika salt and pepper on top while cooking. Once the breasts were cooked and the mushrooms and shallots (replaced onions) were soft I removed the chicken and set aside. I deglazed the pan with a little more butter and then my key ingredient - one can of condensed cream of mushroom soup. I added 3 tbsp on water and cooked for 3 minutes. Viola. Lovely recipe - a keeper for sure!",
