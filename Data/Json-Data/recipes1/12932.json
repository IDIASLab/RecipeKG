I added one large green pepper, a stalk of celery, and a can of tomatoes.  To this I added 3/4 cup of rice, and one cup of water.  i added two cans of tuna to the mixture.  I added a dash of mustard seed, some thyme, some basil, and ground pepper.  I let everything simmer for about 40 mins, untill it not longer looked like soup.  I served it in a pasta bowl, sprinkled with ground pepper to taste, and salt, and shredded old cheddar cheese.  YUM!!!  just remember you need lots of pepper!",
