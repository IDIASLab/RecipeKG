London broil is a tough meat so first off you really need to marinate it for at least 24 hours. I usually marinate it 48 hours which is what I did with this particular marinade. I used olive oil instead of veg. oil (personal perference) and since I didn't have tarragon vinegar used a mix of tarragon and white wine vinegar (as that's a bit on the mild side). Well with all that having been done I must say the taste just wasn't there. I'm not sure if it was an incorrect mix of herbs and spices or if the meat tenderizer (something I normally don't use) threw it off but I definitely won't make this again...",

I follow everything exact (generally use gas grill though) except I grill about 6 or 7 minutes per side...if it's a larger cut I'll wrap it in foil for about 10 minutes after grilling...this will help leave it medium in the middle and medium well on the edges for those that like it more done. Thanks for the recipe!!",

It will be tender whatever method of marinating you use though I always include some lemon or other acid to help tenderize. I also never use store-bought tenderizers but that's just me.
