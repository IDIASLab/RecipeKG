I planned this around an entire Middle Eastern dinner!  I have never had anything like this.  (I know, where have I been all my life?)  I wasn't sure at all that I'd like all the spices, many of which were common to a pumpkin pie!  I was particularly wary of the cinnamon and was tempted to cut it way back.  But I was eager to try this, and figured if worse came to worst we could always come up with Plan B.  I was so pleased, so surprised!  Somehow the myriad of spices all come together and produce something pleasantly and mildly flavorful, albeit unusually so.  I found they're not as good on their own, however, as they are tucked in a pita or flatbread with some fresh greens and tzatziki sauce (thinly sliced tomato and red onion would have been very good with this too - wish I would have thought of that BEFORE we sat down to dinner)  I made them into little sausage shapes, two per skewer, then turned them over to Hubs, who grilled them to perfection over charcoal.  Still, this preparation of meat is different and unfamiliar to most of us, and as such won't appeal to everyone - as it did not with my mother...  (Note: I used two parts lamb, one part ground chuck)",
