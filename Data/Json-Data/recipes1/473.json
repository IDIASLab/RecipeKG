I only make them on for special events though since they are so time consuming and the dough is difficult to work with. But boy are they worth the extra effort!! Note: I generally double the filling/frosting called for in the recipe otherwise it isn't enough. Also put your frosting in a gallon ziploc bag cut off a small portion of a corner and use the bag to squirt on the frosting. You break less cookies that way and it is much easier than using a knife to spread it on.",

My mom always resists making them at Christmas time because it's a nuisance to roll out the dough, but last year we had an idea that worked really well.  We put the dough on wax paper, rolled it into a log and then refrigerated it.  After it chilled, we took it out and simply sliced the log.  It was sooo much easier and came out just fine.  I also omit the egg yolk with no problems and tint the filling pink.  They're always the first to go as they're so pretty and so delicious!",

                "reviewBody": "At first I didn't understand this recipe.  How can you have a shortbread like cookie with no sugar in it?  BUT I made it and it was wonderful.  I made one small change and that was to add a little vanilla to the dough.  Since you coat the cut out cookie with sugar on both sides, that gives it enough sweetness.  The cookies are flakey and buttery with so much flavor.  I used a sanding sugar which added a bit of sparkle.  When it came to the filling, I did not use the recipe listed - I used my basic buttercream recipe and I thinned it a little with my left over heavy whipping cream.  I did not feel too good about making the filling recipe with the raw egg.  I'm sure it would be safe but it just didn't sound tasty.  And when you put everything together - it's a beautiful little cookie.  They look pretty fancy!  I took one reviewers suggestion and put a small dab of raspberry jam on one side of the cookie before I added the buttercream filling.  Actually, I didn't think they were very time consuming like some reveiwers said and I made a double recipe.  I bake all the time and do some pretty complicated recipes so the time spent on these seemed very reasonable.  These would make a beautiful gift.",

Our recipe calls for 'light cream', which i prefer because it seems to brown more slowly.  I like them at 10 minutes, too, because I love them just slightly golden.  We always used the raw yolk in the cream filling with no problem -- I like the richness.  Parchment paper DEFINITELY aids in rolling (between 2 layers) and I use a napkin ring to cut them out ;-)  The compliments are endless on these labor intensive, luscious cookies.",

After much effort ours turned out exactly like others pictured here. However for the cookie that was the most work they just did no deliver on taste. The cookie part was very bland and the buttercream center just could not make up for it. I gave it one star as the colored center looks nice but we will not be making this cookie again.",
