I compared recipes and many were similar but the quantities in this recipe were easy to acquire and assemble NO WASTE ie: only needing 1 tub of cheese, 250 ml (1 cup) of whippig cream etc. Only thing I wished being a virgin  TIRAMSU maker was to have a bit more detail about the importance of creaming the cheese before adding the egg custard, I did well but if wasn't perfect. So my tip would be to have the cheese room temp and use a heavy duty rubber spatula to work the cheese so it is soft and NOT curduy, but then again it could have been my brand of cheese.

I didn't add any alcohol to the coffee mixture there was enough flavour from custard mixture; also this is a good way to make so children and adults who don't want or can't have the extra alcohol. Instead of dusting with cocoa powder I grated finely bittersweet chocolate over top.

What most people don't realize is that the \"store bought\" or often times \"restaurant served\" tiramisu is a knockoff that leaves much to be desired. Tiramisu is meant to have strong flavors to be truly Italian. I make this every time my office has a \"food day\". It's gotten to the point that when word goes out we are having a potluck I am bombarded with emails ensuring that I will be bringing the tiramisu. PLEASE NOTE - this recipe is meant to be made ahead of time and chilled preferably overnight. Rushing this dish will result in your disappointment and in a crunchy layer of ladyfingers and lumpy cheese mixture. To properly make tiramisu takes time and patience. I am Italian and it has taken me years to perfect tiramisu because of the time involved to make it correctly. If you make this properly between the chill times and actual work times it should take about 3 hours BEFORE you chill it which should preferably be overnight or at least 4-5 hours. If you take your time and are patient and ensure that your mascarpone mixture is lump-free you will have wonderful success with tiramisu!",

I am not sure that I have had a tiramisu before but it is my sis's fav so I tried it. She loved it and said it got better over time. I am making it again for the second time for my step-daughter. I used a 9 by 9 and made 1 1/2 times the mixture to fill my pan. I used Godiva Choc. liqueur in place of brandy. I also grinded up dark choc and milk choc covered espresso beans and sprinkled on top along with the cocoa. The soft ladyfingers from Trader Joe's worked great. I am not sure if this is what true tiramisu is supposed to taste like but I really enjoyed it and will make again for special occasions. Thanks for the great recipe (and sorry for the revisions!)",
