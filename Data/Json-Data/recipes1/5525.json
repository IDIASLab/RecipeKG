I used a full cup of peanut butter (instead of 3/4 cup) and poured the mixture into a Oreo crust (to save some time). I've had the best results as far as texture by cooking it for about 45 minutes or until it is golden on the edges and soft in the middle. Then I turn off the heat and crack the oven door and let it cool to room temperature before refrigerating. If you like peanut butter you'll love this cheesecake!",

On our  first date (wedding day too) my husband and I shared a piece of  cheesecake like this that was made by a dessert shop in our area.  It holds special memories and we try and have one  on special occasions /anniversaries. But after 14 years of marriage, their little 5 inch cheesecake at $30 bucks a pop, started adding up!  I didn't want to buy one this year so, I turned to my favorite friend, Allrecipes!  I stumbled upon this recipe and I'm SOOO glad!  This one, as my husband states, is even better than the 'Affairs' cheesecake!!!!  As far as particulars,  I took the advice of previous reviewers (thx!!) and used the 1 1/2 c. crushed chocolate wafers and 6 T. melted butter crust - a MUST!  I also used the mini chocolate chips (1 1/2 c.).  I baked it for the recommended time 45-50 minutes and then turned the oven off, cracked the door and brought it to room temp. in there.  Then I chilled it.  Make sure you chill it for the recommended time (key to good cheesecake), if not over night.  Otherwise, you'll have a soft center.  This is the  best recipe.  Thanks so much!!!!!",

I used the Chocolate Wafer Crust from this site (1.5 cups chocolate wafers/6 tbsp butter) and 1 1/3 cups of mini chocolate chips. The edges were already getting dark after 35 min so I turned the oven off and left the door open. Consistency was perfect very minimal cracking. Topped the cooled cheesecake with a thin layer of peanut butter toasted chopped nuts and sparse mini chocolate chips as suggested. This cheesecake was actually good enough to spark controversy for me at work: apparently people were offended when I tried to pass off store-bought baked goods (this cheesecake)as my own--- HA!",

I bake for about 10minutes to set while I prepare the batter. I like to melt additional chocolate and cover the top then I line the edges with quartered reeses pb cups. The result is a giant reeses peanut butter cup. Just took it to a Super Bowl party and people were tackling each other to get a slice!",
