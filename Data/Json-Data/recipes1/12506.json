The times I make two pies, I put the unused jello in a individual sized teddybear pan, so my toddlers can have a snack later w/o the fattening cream cheese mixture.  They love it!!  Anyway, I filled w/enough cream cheese topping to cover the bottom & sides of the pre-made crust. ...waited about 5-10 min. for the jello to cool from boiling (necessary), and then placed it on top until it reached the rim of the crust.  Be sure you're still able to carry it to the fridge w/o the blueberry mixture spilling over ...making the crust look not as presentable (speaking from experience). lol  The next morning, the texture was so nice, and there was a beautiful layer of cream cheese on the bottom.  Plenty of extra that I put in a Tupperware for those piggy's in my family to add more on top if they wanted.  I am always thrilled to show off this recipe, so thanks for the user who published it!  People always say it's the best!!",

For anyone who tried this and didn't care for it try making it the way I described -- it tastes SO much better and the amounts are just right for a 9X13 pan and the same amounts of topping ingredients. Also I use a clear glass pan - I wouldn't recommend putting it in a metal pan as I'm sure this could affect the taste.",
