I think what takes them from a \"5\" to a \"4\" for me is the sickeningly sweet filling.  (And, believe me, I read reviews all the time that say \"way too sweet\" and I think...duh, it's a cooking/cake/candy, but this is sweeeeet)  The cookies themselves are very good and they look nice as sandwiches.  I'll prob make again for the holidays (and I think I'll use a choc filling of some sort), but not before.  If you make these, the dough is a firm dough; it's very easy to work w/and is not sticky.  Thanks for a nice change from the \"usual\" cookies!  UPDATE:  so, I've changed my original \"4\" to a \"5\" and here's why...I made the mistake of eating the filling right from the bowl (really really sweet) and then trying a cookie shortly after w/the sweet taste still on my mind.  I ate a cookie the next day and it was AWESOME.  Still soft and the filling was a nice compliment, not too sweet w/only a small amount in the middle.  I stand corrected and I WILL make these again!  UPDATE #2:  I just doubled & it made me 85 sandwich cookies (and a very full & floury Kitchenaid).  I haven't filled them yet, but I plan to keep the filing measurements from the original recipe.  ",

To do the sandwiches, I put a dollop of the frosting in center of one cooled cookie without spreading it to the edges.  The force of pushing the second cookie on top spread the filling perfectly without it oozing over the side and making a mess.  I set the cookies out on wax paper for a couple hours so the filling could harden, and the filling stiffened up just enough to hold together without becoming \"hard\".  They are just as moist and delicious on day 4 as they were on day 1.  Make sure to store with bread slices to keep them soft!",

I used butter instead of shortening (I didn't have any shortening) and I used half creamy half chunky peanut butter for the cookies themselves. I did have to add some milk to the frosting to make it more spreadable. I learned after the first batch that I was making the cookie balls way too big. They spread out a lot (but that probably has everything to do with using butter instead of shortening). I made them a lot smaller because a giant cookie with that much sweetness could be a little much. Either way it's a good change from the normal old peanut butter cookies.
