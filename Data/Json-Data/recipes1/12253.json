This article has several tips, one of which is to refrigerate the batter for a while to allow the gluten to settle down and let the baking powder start to act, resulting in fluffy pancakes.  Also , do not stir before using as this pops all the little bubbles created from the sitting.  Interesting, huh!?!  Anyway, except for a little vanilla, made recipe as it reads and I was happy with them.",

In our family we all like the whole grain pancakes from the health store mix that my mom made while we were young. I tried these and no one DISliked them--one of my sisters the one with the deviant taste from the rest of us said that she loved them and ate about 5--but I felt that they weren't quite what I was looking for. Maybe they would have been better with a touch of vanilla for flavor or if I had used whole wheat instead of white flour at least in part. However it was worth a try. Thanks!",
