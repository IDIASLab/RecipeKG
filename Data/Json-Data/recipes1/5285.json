It tends to chew up add-ins and I had planned on adding another 1/4 cup or so during the last 5 minutes of kneading but fouled up my timer and missed the whole thing! By adding the extra at the start I didn't need the last-minute add. I added 1/2 tsp. salt and found it to be just a little flat -- a problem that could be solved by sprinkling a little salt on the slice while eating it. Next batch will have a full tsp. salt. Loved this one -- thanks for submitting it! Update: I don't agree with those who thought this was not good the next day. I'm eating it for breakfast and it's great!",
