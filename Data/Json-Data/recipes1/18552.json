Even my son who dislikes rhubarb loves this one. Adapted from the diabetic/diet version (Rhubarb Rumble). I like to make this in an 11x7-inch (2-quart) glass pan, making my own graham cracker crust. The addition of fresh strawberries adds an extra layer of lusciousness. It ends up being a very PRETTY IN PINK dessert. The hard part is waiting for it to chill.",

I cooked the rhubarb with the Jello in the microwave with 2 cups of water as stated on the Jello package. Should I have used only 1 cup of water...or no water? Also I used the Keebler extra large (10\") graham cracker pie crust and had too much filling. I would really appreciate clarification on the jello - water ratio as the pie is really tasty and I would make it again with an adjusted recipe.",
