Too lazy to make homemade broth, I used boxed chicken broth instead of the water, and added leftover cooked chicken I had in the fridge. Not a fan of vegetable oil, I sauteed the onions and celery in butter. I didn't have any wild rice on hand, but I did have a box of Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice, and I found the accompanying seasoning packet provided a bonus of flavor. The wine is a must and should not be omitted. This is a keeper recipe, with room for personal touches and variations. ",

The end result was amazing (better than any restaurant version) and well worth the time. My significant changes: 1)Three dried bay leaves added to simmering chicken; 2)replaced fresh mushrooms with 1/2oz of dried chopped up porcini mushrooms to the soup,the flavor was amazing; 3)sauted four chopped garlic cloves with veggies, 4)added wine right after sauteing veggies rather than at end of recipe; 5)added a handful of fresh sage leaves towards end of cooking because I have them (dried sage, thyme, rosemary or other aromatic herb would be great, but added earlier); 6)increased salt and black pepper to taste.  7) I used 3 bone-in chicken breasts (plenty of meat) and substituted 5 cups of homemade stock and 2 cups for remaining water in recipe 8) butter instead of margarine.  This recipe is a great starting point, but needs your personal touch to make it truly spectacular!  I've made this with and without wine, it really makes a difference. So does the dried porcini. Regular mushrooms just don't add the drool-worthy flavor.",

I use boneless chicken breasts, which I cook the day before to make it less time-consuming.  I couldn't find wild rice by itself, so I buy two boxes of Uncle Ben's and cook it without the butter or seasoning packets.  I use 3 cups whole milk and one cup heavy cream, and 4 cups store-bought chicken broth with 3 cups of water from boiling the chicken.  I serve it with Pepperidge Farm Sourdough Artisan bread and salad.  It takes a while to make the soup, but it's totally worth it!",

For those who had trouble with the soup not being thick enough keep in mind you really have to stir the milk in the flour/butter roux for quite a while on medium heat. It takes about 15 minutes for it to get thick enough and it should get so thick that it's tiring to keep whisking it. It might not seem like it's going to thicken but keep at it and it will. I didn't use bouillon but seasoned the water that I boiled the chiken in with lots of celery garlic cloves salt and pepper. It was still a little bland so I added a few dashes of worcestishire sauce and it was fine. I might put a little less wine in mine next time it was a bit overpowering. I used Sauvignon Blanc but I think sherry might taste better. Real wild rice is the key in this I think. Very nice.",

I also used 5 minute wild rice which I cooked for two minutes drained and added at the very end. I omitted the wine but I'm sure it would be great with it as well.",
