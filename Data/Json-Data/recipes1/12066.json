Left out the sugar and nutmeg used extra garlic a carrot and fresh cilantro instead of parsley. Also used crushed red pepper flakes for the heat and the chopped garlic adds a little heat as well. I don't understand anyone saying it's bland. Sauteing in oil releases lots of flavor! Make sure you drain the water off the salted zucchini or soup will be too salty.
