I modified this so much that my rating almost doesn't apply to the recipe as written! I used half whole wheat and half all-purpose flour 3/4 cup brown sugar and 2/3 of a large very ripe banana (for extra moisture and flavor) 1/2 cup walnuts (didn't have enough!) and 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips. I also skipped the powdered sugar. As noted these had to bake a lot longer than the recipe stated (about 35 minutes) and needed a much larger pan (9x13). They came out really tasty though although almost too sweet for my taste so I may add even less sugar next time I make them. I might even try making them as muffins.",

Could be improved by adding a little oil or butter as the lack of these in the recipe causes a slightly dry sponge consistency. But adding the oil would make it a slightly less healthy recipe.",
