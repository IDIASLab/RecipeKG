Instead of using buttermilk which I never have around I combine 1 TBS malt vinegar 1 TBS part-skim ricotta cheese and enough milk to make 1 cup blending well with a whisk. I bake them 15 minutes at 425 degrees - they got a little too brown at 450. I have also made them without the rye flour using 2 parts whole wheat flour to 1 part soy flour. The recipe as stated only yielded 6 muffins in my pan so I always make a double batch now. They freeze well and make a great workday snack with a little butter. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",

I used apple sauce 1 tsp baking powder in place of the egg and 1 cup nonfat plain yogurt in place of the buttermilk. I used 1 banana (mashed) in place of the oil and I added 1 tbs of chia seeds. I also added chopped prunes & dates and some chopped walnuts as well. I baked at 350 deg for about 22 minutes. These muffins turned out fantastic. Super healthy but very delicious.

                "reviewBody": "Because of the comments saying the muffins lacked flavor I used butter instead of oil but I accidentally used 1/3 cup instead of the 1 tablespoon because I was looking at the wrong recipe. I also increased the salt to 3/4 teaspoon used 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of molasses used oat bran instead of barley flour and used a combination of reconstituted milk non-fat milk and apple juice for the liquid. I sprinkled brown sugar and quick oats on top for a garnish. They were very tasty but a little on the salty and buttery side. I think next time I will use 2 tablespoons of butter the same 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and the same mix of flours and liquids. The balance of flours in this recipe is good because the use of soy flour isn't apparent in the texture or flavor. I basically made these in lieu of multi-grain bread so someone who wants more \"traditional\" muffins should probably add spices or fruit.",

However and maybe it's because I substituted soy milk for the buttermilk the texture turned out a bit too chewy for my taste. Kind of like that bread they serve at Ethiopian restaurants. I heeded other reviewers' advice and lowered the oven temperature to 400 and the muffins were done in 17 minutes and not burned at all. I added chopped walnuts raisins and dried cranberries. Overall an OK muffin but there are lots of other healthy muffin recipes out there that taste better than this.",
