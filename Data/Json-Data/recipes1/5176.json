The most time consuming part is slicing the onion / removing fat from the chicken (although I really didn't need to do the latter...). Use the best quality balsamic you can find - and afford (it REALLY does make a difference). Next time, I'll use a better quality balsamic (the dish was a tad tangy, but I like tart, so it wasn't an issue for me),  mix the balsamic, tomatoes & spices together BEFORE adding to the skillet (the spices tend to clump together otherwise) and add fresh minced garlic to the skillet as the breasts simmer (in lieu of the garlic salt called for).  If you are in a hurry or don't have all of the spices on hand, substitute Italian seasoned tomatoes for the plain ones and omit the seasonings alltogether.  This dish goes particularly well with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans, although, I think I'll try it with seasoned rice (i.e. chicken flavor) & steamed asparagus or broccoli next time to change things up a bit.",

I prepped everything the night before and the next morning just popped everything in the crockpot and turned on low, the chicken was even frozen. I did use only 1/4 C. of balsamic vinegar as recommended in other reviews and I will add garlic cloves instead of garlic salt next time. Also, I will use chicken on the bone instead of boneless/skinless chicken breast if I plan on making this in the crockpot. The boneless chicken turned out dry. Other than that, the taste was very good.",

Cut down the rosemary, basil, and oregano to 1/4 tsp each and omitted the thyme.  Threw in sauteed mushrooms and roasted red peppers I had prepared for another meal.  Now here's the secret, use the very best balsamic vinegar you can find as it has the smoothest flavor and will cut down on the tart vinegar flavor and you must use San Marzano tomatoes.  It makes all the difference....  Served this over angel hair pasta with a salad.  Family loved it!!!",

Not only will this be in our regular rotation, but it is also company worthy (a huge compliment coming from me!) As if this wasn't enough, it so economical and easy/quick to prepare. Over all, a winner!!! For all the reviewres complaining about the balsamic vinegar......If you're not a fan of it why would you try a dish where that is a prominant ingredient? I really can't figure that one out......",
