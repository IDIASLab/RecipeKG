As for the double boiler method, I always use a makeshift with my biggest metal bowl over a pan that I fill about 1/3 full of hot water. It just sets in there so that your custard isn't directly over the heat. I did whisk it occasionally, but you don't have to stir constantly like you would if it was directly over heat. I did follow the suggestion to use coconut milk (and I just threw in the whole can, because what am I going to do with another half cup of coconut milk?) and some flaked coconut, and it was really delicious. The ice cream in the custard adds a nice effect, and once it was really chilled and set, my husband found it reminiscent of a coconut marshmallow (or maybe that's the gelatin that makes it marshmallow like). Anyway, the extra couple of minutes it takes to make this recipe are worth it, for sure.",
