Tweak any way you like..add chicken less cheese...always turns out delicious. Thanks Maria!!",

I did leave off the parmesan as two members of the family are lactose intolerant; I just put out a canister of parmesan at the table for everyone else to sprinkle on top. It may have had more flavor with the parmesan cooked in. It needs way more garlic too or perhaps I will season it with garlic salt rather than regular salt. Maybe some oregano or other Italian herbs too. I did love the way the pasta absorbed the flavor of the brocolli though. All in all it is a good base recipe I do intend to make it again and play around with it a bit. (P.S. Leftovers reheated well later in the week I think it actually tasted better the second time around!)",
