The coffee liqueur was way too strong for me so next time I will use a strong coffee and use maybe a cup not the 1-1/2 cup this recipe calls for because the toasts were saturated and added nothing to the texture of this dish. I think that with these changes I will definitely make again. thanks for sharing your recipe!",
