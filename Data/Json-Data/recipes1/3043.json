I use Mexican bread called bolillo I sliced them about 1\" slices butter them up, toast them up and set aside., I use piloncillo, water,  canela sticks, cloves and make a syrup.\nI use Monterrey jack cheese and I do the layer system. I use a deep baking pan or dish.\ntortilla in the bottom, so it won't burn. bread, banana slices, walnuts, raisins ,apples chunks, dried plums, you basically put what you like i have to do two batches because my son does not like bananas, well then you and the cheese top that with one cup or more so you soak the bread a little with the piloncillo syrup. then start second layer. you can go a high as 4 layers. hope you like it",
