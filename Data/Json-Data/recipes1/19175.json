                "reviewBody": "In terms of ingredients one chocolate chip cookie recipe is pretty much like the rest. It's the subtle differences in those ingredients that in my view distinguish a mediocre or average chocolate chip cookie from a great one. This one is average. The flavor was okay tho' I did reduce the salt by half and the cookie was just fine with that amount. But for me they're too greasy and soft. (Not cake-like at all as some reviewers have remarked. Not even close.) A little more flour perhaps a quarter cup or equalizing the amounts of brown sugar and granulated sugar (brown sugar tends to make cookies softer) would probably take care of the problem. But then that would be a different recipe illustrating my point that it's the little nuances of a basic recipe that take it from good to great.",

The only thing I would suggest is using unsalted butter. It doesn't specify to do so in the recipe but maybe using salted butter and the salt called for in the recipe is the reason some had less than perfect results?
