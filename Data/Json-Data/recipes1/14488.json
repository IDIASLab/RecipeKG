I embellished upon the recipe which made this dish a solid five star recipe.  The chicken, which I seasoned only with salt and freshly ground pepper, developed a much more appealing look and color dredged in flour before sauteeing. Once I turned it over I covered it just briefly to make sure it was cooked through. After removing the chicken to set aside, I deglazed the pan with about 1/4 c. of white wine, then added the cream, a good squeeze of lemon (didn't use the lemon pepper at all), and now the dill.  I used only two chicken breasts but kept the sauce measurements the same (essentially doubled the sauce), and it was just the right amount. If prepared with the amount of sauce as the recipe directs it would be pretty skimpy!   The chicken was moist, tender and flavorful, with a rich, creamy lemon/caper/wine/dill sauce that made an already good chicken something extraordinarily delicious.  I served this with cappellini pasta and \"Spaghetti Squash Saute,\" also from this site. This was an outrageously delicious dish,  a definite \"make again.\"   This cooking method and the sauce, by the way, would also be wonderful with salmon or other types of fish as well!",

I am glad I did that because we had exactly the right amount of sauce.  I would highly recommend trying this WITHOUT putting any flour/cornstarch in the sauce because it was perfect without it.  I usually like to try a recipe exactly as written the first time and then make adjustments (if needed) the next time.  However, without changing any of the ingredients I did them a little differently.  I marinated the chicken breasts in lemon juice for about 15 minutes and then seasoned them with ground pepper, sea salt, and fresh baby dill.  I diced one clove of garlic and added it to the butter that the chicken cooked in.  That was the only variation from the recipe that I made.  My husband, daughter and son-in-law raved about this one and instructed me to give it a top rating.  I will definitely make this many times again, it would be perfect for company.  I served it with steamed broccoli and lightly buttered penne pasta with fresh grated parmesan.",

I didn't have any lemon pepper so I used McCormick's Key West Spice Blend (lemon zest, basil and thyme) and added black pepper in it's place. I also deglazed the pan with a couple splashes of white wine before I sauted some garlic and added the fat free half and half, as suggested by others. It was outstanding!

I made a couple of alterations: used heavy whipping cream, doubled and added 1 tbsp of flour to it for thicker sauce. Used a little Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning (we put it on everything in Louisiana!!!) in addition to the other seasonings for the chicken and sauteed freshly minced garlic before I added the chicken to the butter. Also cut the breasts into medium sized pieces and placed them back in the skillet with the sauce to mildly simmer for another 10-15 min. Definitely want some bread to dip in the sauce!!!",

My husband soaked up every bit of the sauce (that I doubled) with his rice and went back for seconds. I also pounded the chicken breasts thin like other reviewers suggested. The chicken cooks up really quick and tender this way. Or, you can use the thin-sliced chicken breasts at the supermarket if you are in a hurry. I am going to try fat-free half and half next time for some of the cream. Thanks for the great recipe! Update 1/17/06-Made again tonite and used fat-free half & half and less butter- worked great. Also, lightly floured chicken with the seasonings and put some of dill directly in sauce. Uploaded picture.",

This is a great recipe that I only adjusted a bit after reading other reviews that made sense. Adjustments were: (1)squeezing lemon juice onto chicken breasts and then seasoning with (2) garlic pepper and dried dill weed. Then let sit 15 minutes. (3) NOT turning chicken more than twice. (4) De-glazing the pan with 1/2 cup Pinot Grigio and simmer down by one half before adding doubled recipe amounts of sauce ingredients and then letting that reduce a bit - as per directions. The thin consistency complaints I've read should be adressed by REDUCING, NOT ADDING STARCH OR FLOUR. This is a sauce and not a gravy! I like to serve this with an asparagus amandine and a cooked pasta saut\u00e9ed with EV olive oil, butter, garlic and parmesan. The sauce just gets all over everything and is INcredible! Thank you mommyto2boys for this great recipe! You should let your husband browse for ingredients some more!",

I did use fat free half n half (and it was fresh) but other than that I followed the recipe.  The chicken had good flavor but I didn't even try to serve the sauce.  Any ideas on what might have affected the sauce?",
