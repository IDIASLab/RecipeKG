Everyone enjoyed it. I gave it a 3 star for kids because I'm not sure that kids would enjoy the raisins figs and such and we didn't share it with kids. I gave the Easiness a 4 star because some of the ingredients were hard to pull out or figure out from the passages but the spices aren't really mentioned by name in the verses. Overall it's fun!",
