Red Cake is only good with the right frosting.",

Make this cake once and you will HAVE to make it again. Save it for special occasions so you only have to go through all of that food coloring once or twice a year or so.

                "reviewBody": "The reason some reviewers are coming up short with a single batch of frosting is because the recipe as originally developed called for frosting between the cake layers only NOT the sides. The classic way to frost this cake is to leave the sides unfrosted and a thick spread of frosting between each layer. I'm also surprised at the amount of cocoa and vinegar in some of these recipes. My grandmother's recipe (consistant blue ribbon winner at fairs) calls for only 1 tsp of vinegar and 2 1/2 tsps cocoa. Too much cocoa ruins the bright red color of the cake it comes out too brown plus that might be what caused a \"heavy floury taste\" that one reviewer complained about.",
