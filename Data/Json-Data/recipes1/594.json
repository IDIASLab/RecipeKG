And sooo easy to make but definitely CHILL the dough (about 30 min.) before rolling or you'll end up with sticky dough all over your hands. If in a hurry spray or grease your hands with cooking spray or oil b4 rolling. Followed a reviewers tip and added 1 cup of rice crispies - awesome! Thanks for the tip! I also used mini chocolate chips which I cut back to about 2/3 cups and also cut back on the sugar to 2/3 cups. Perfect sweetness this way. Have also decrease butter to 1.5 cups - great can't tell the difference. Looks like little truffles if you roll in cocoa powder and tastes just like a peanut butter cup. Oh and I always use a standing mixer with the paddle attachment to mix the dough. 1 min. of mixing and I'm done - quick and no mess! Have made this many times- love it!",

He asked for the recipe but I couldn't wait. I started my search and came across this recipe and thought that I would give it a try. Well he said that it tasted exactly like what he had. He did suggest to cut back a little on the mini chocolate chips. I guess the other recipe did not have as many and he isn't a chocoholic. I did refrigerate before I rolled them and it seemed to be alot easier. Thanks for sharing!!",
