I also didn't cook them as long due to my altitude. They definitely don't need to be soaked in anything but unfortunately they still have no flavor. They are sweet but no flavor. We concluded that the cookies just taste like oatmeal with chocolate chips. I gave 3 stars though because I think I might make these again minus the chocolate chips as a \"breakfast cookie\" that I can grab on my way out the door in the mornings. PS- They did run all over the pan and had no shape but that was ok with me. And they were doughy but I like my cookies doughy.",
