I boiled 2 cups of water tossed in a knorr's chicken bouillon cube then when that dissolved I slowly added the egg. I think 1 egg for 2 cups of broth was perfect for me. I skipped the peas and the green onion (because we are out) I dont think it needs the peas but would be even better with the green onion. After cooking I just added a dash of white pepper and that was it. My husband did not want to try it at first because he has tried the egg drop soup at chinese restuarants before and never liked it. When he tried this he didn't want to stop eating it! My 2 year old also really liked it. Thank you for this recipe I think I will be making it a lot.",
