Also, it was beautiful and brown after 50 mins of baking. I did use a dark, nonstick loaf  pan. My oven temperature is usally quite accurate.  It was the first time I've used persimmons in baking. My neighbor shared some from her garden. Now I'm anxious to get more so I can make more of this delicious bread. I read that you can freeze persimmon pulp so I'd like to do that and be able to make this even when they're not in season. Thank you v monte for this wonderful recipe!!",

I added 1 1/2 cups (combined) dried apricots, raisins, dates, and candied ginger, the zest of 1 whole orange, and 1/2 tsp each nutmeg, cloves, and cardammom. The second time, I wanted a more persimmon flavor (the bread has no persimmon flavor as written). I added added 1 1/2 cups chopped ripe fresh unpeeled persimmon, 1/2 cup dried dates, and 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, with as much spices as the first time. It was the perfect amount of spice for me. The 2nd time around, I also replaced white with whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup brown sugar rather than the suggested amount of white sugar. The result was a much stronger persimmon flavor and a moist bread, despite the subtracted sugar. I also find it easier to mix in the nuts and dried fruit right before pouring the batter into the pan rather than with the dry ingredients.",

To make the fruit pulp, I diced the fruit and then put it in the blender.  I also used golden raisins instead of regular raisins, because I thought the color would look nice and I also think they have more flavor than regular raisins.  I would definitely recommend this recipe if you are looking for something to do with persimmons!  My husband also liked the bread.",

Cutting back on the sugar if anyone else is thinking about it may not be the best idea. I made two versions and it was definitely better with the full amount. That said I like that it has a real bread flavor (as opposed to cake). I gave it a 4 because I think it could have used some more of the spices. It was a little bland. Next time I think I'll add a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice as well. All in all pretty good. Thank you for the recipe!",

Where you use 3cups of sugar I used 3 cups of Splenda and Ialso changed 3 cups allpurpose flour to Gold Medal Speciality Flour thats better for bread baking. I increased the walnuts to 1- 1/2cups and added 1-1/2 cups of rasins Instead of greasing the pans I Pam them. That is so good and my neighbor really likes it. Oh so did my mom.
