The only thing I changed was I wanted more Taco Bell like Mexican Pizzas, so I spread the beans on the tortilla, topped that with meat, then addd another tortilla and covered that with cheese and baked for 10 minutes.  Then I topped them with sour cream, salsa, and jalapeno peppers.  Great recipe even without the changes though :)  Thanks",
