I gave him two options from this site and he said 'suprise me'. So I made this one. He absolutly loved it, and so did I!! Like others, I added mushrooms, but I did not have cream so I used whole milk and added a bit of cream cheese (cutting out the other cheeses). Also, I only had Scottish spicy mustand as I am living in Scotland but still love this site. And I have to say it was amazing, and even though I only ate this 4 hours ago I am craving it already and so is my husband. I am only 22, but have been cooking for many years and all I went onto this site for today was cooking times, but this idea was very good. I would have never thought to put this sauce with fish, but it really worked! Thank you!!",
