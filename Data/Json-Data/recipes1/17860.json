Awesome with the stated shortening, but if you're like me and want a lower fat one, you can get a great result with 2 tablespoons shortening (just be aware you may need to adjust the water if reducing the shortening).  I double the recipe and keep the leftovers (if any) wrapped in plastic for the morning. Just put it back on a hot skillet for a minute each side and it becomes soft and pliable again.  Scramble and egg, add cheese, and you have great breakfast burritoes!",

My end result was exactly what they are supposed to look like. and they tasted much better than store bought tortillas. I was very impressed by this recipe, I found that the video was very very helpful. I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. To be completely honest, I did burn one (oops) because I forgot about them on the stove while doing dishes :) But that was my fault. I wouldn't change the recipe at all, just remember to stay at the stove the whole time. Thank you Chef John for sharing this great recipe, I will be looking into your other delicious looking recipes, they look amazing. Oh, and I did not use a tortilla press, I used a rolling pin. They were very fun to make!",

You don't want the dough to cool off because of a cold surface. 3. Keep it warm while resting. If your house is on the cool side then treat it like yeast bread and put it in a cold oven over hot water. The point is the dough NEEDS to stay warm. If you let it cool it won't puff like it should and it won't taste as good.",

I learned from making corn tortillas that they are a lot quicker to make on a pancake griddle. The recipe I have used in the past uses vegetable oil instead of shortening. I prefer that much more because these were a little heavier thick and doughier than what I have made in the past and had a floury after taste I have not experienced in other recipes. I found that a temp. of 350 deg. on the pancake griddle was best for getting the puff like Chef John illustrates in the video. Was interesting to try a new recipe but will stick with the vegetable oil version.",
