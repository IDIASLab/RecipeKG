I also used the individually wrapped swiss cheese slices (similar to the American cheese slices) because they really melt easily and smoothly. Each sandwich only requires 1/2 slice of cheese. If you leave the sandwiches covered a little after removing from the oven the rolls are nicely steamed and soft. These are a tasty and inexpensive way to feed a crowd--a definite crowd pleaser.

This time, I took them out at 15 minutes and they were heated through perfectly.  Keep your eye on them because they start to brown pretty quickly, and you may want to cover with some foil to complete the cooking.  I can see making these so many different ways just by changing what's between the top and bottom bun, but keeping the butter sauce the same.  I'm thinking turkey and swiss with AR's onion jam recipe, and Italian beef, mozzarella, and some roasted red peppers and onions .  Yeah, they're a little decadent nutrition-wise, but they're worth the splurge every now and then.  Definitely worth consideration for a Super Bowl party.",
