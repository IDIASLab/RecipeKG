For all you \"first time fryers\" my sister gave me this tip:  to tell when the oil is hot enough, dip a wooden spoon into the oil and look to see if bubbles form around it.  If bubbles form, your oil is ready to fry in.",

This recipe was great in flavor, but I wasn't crazy about the texture.  After the first batch, I made some changes and found them to be exactly what I was looking for.  The flour made the breading too soft. I reduced the flour by 1/2 cup, which made equal parts flour, cornmeal, and breadcrumbs.  This gave the tomatoes the crispness that they needed.  Again, the flavor was great!  I received many compliments and will continue to use this recipe.  Thanks!!",

Until I do I will surely be using this one.  Here's a no fuss no muss tip that I use whenever I am breading things - I just simply pull out a long sheet of wax paper and put it on the counter next to the stove - line up the flour, next the cornmeal and breadcrumbs (you can mix it with your hands on the paper), put the breaded tomatoes on the end.  Roll up the wax paper when you are finished - the only plate you have is the egg mixture!!!!  I love wax paper to cut down the mess. Thanks for sharing the recipe Diana.",
