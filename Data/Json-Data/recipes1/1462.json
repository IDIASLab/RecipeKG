I will try again using less water and some brown sugar and wheat flour as this is how the A&P one is made. It also needs a frosting I used butter icing sugar vanilla and milk.",

She said it was very close to the original (A&P) version. Used the Allspice Cream Cheese Icing from this site. Wow! REally added to it. I cut the water for the raisins down to 3 1/2 cups added extra allspice (didn't have cinnamon) 1 1/2 cups walnuts and used self-rising flour. The result was a deliciously moist cake that I'm planning to take to my in-laws for Thanksgiving. Mom also suggested adding a can of apple pie filling to the bottom of the pan before adding the batter over top. Baked for 40-45 minutes.",

I iced it with the Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting here on the site and it just complimented it perfectly. Tasted like a bakery cake. I followed the recipe except I did put my raisins through my food processor just to chop them up a little bit and then I thought that was just a bit too much batter for a 9X13 pan so I used a 10X16 and it worked out just great. If you do use a bigger pan adjust your time down about 6 minutes or so.",
