                "reviewBody": "My reaction to the frosting was the opposite of Skatru's.  I was actually looking for a cream cheese flavor since I had never heard of anyone making frosting out of cream cheese (except for cream cheese frosting, of course)  I also used about 90% of the jar of hazelnut spread and found the hazelnut to be the predominant flavor when it was finished.\n\nThis comes together very easily and very quickly.  It can be used right away and is also very pipeable.  I would suggest letting it chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and it will be easier to handle. \n\nAlso, I find if you leave this overnight, the flavors have more of a chance to blend and the frosting is even better once that happens.\n\nThis is definately a keeper and I am so glad I found it.  Thank you Kimberly P. for this wonderful recipe!",
