The flavor is delicate, with a hint of sweetness in the backround. The crust is crisp, but those who like theirs thick will have to follow some of the modifications for chewy, crusty crust in the other reviews.  \nI used all-purpose flour, since I don't have bread flour on hand, and after reading reviews saying these rolls were bland,**I added 1 1/2 tsp of honey** to the sugar and yeast when proofing it. I found that I didn't need to add as much flour as was called for in the recipe, but that could be because I used all-purpose. I used 3 cups, and then as much as was needed to keep from sticking when I kneaded it. **I let it rise on the top of the preheating stove, away from the heat of the vents**, and it worked well. After I deflated it, I kneaded it in the bowl for a few minutes, then divided it into 8 rolls and covered them with the same oiled plastic wrap I used to cover the dough for the first rise. **I had preheated the stove to 375 degrees, instead of the suggested 400, because it gave me more control on the darkness of the bread**. I brushed them with melted butter, and they baked for 18 minutes until they were a lovely golden brown. I will definitely make this again, and will pass on the recipe. Thank you, Jo!",

I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer to do all the mixing and kneading, so all I had to do was roll it out.  I made half the recipe into a regular-sized french bread roll and the other half into the rounds.  Next time I'll separate it into four pieces and try to make smaller baguettes, because after it had risen, it was bigger than I wanted.  Warning:  this is a very sticky dough to work with, but apparently french bread usually is, so don't be alarmed like I was!  Thanks for sharing, Jo.",

The bread was clinging slightly to my mixing bowl, so any more would have dried them out.  I also didn't use bread flour as it makes the rolls a bit dense.  All purpose gave them a nice, fluffy lift.  On a personal note.  I find it infuriating that people give recipes one star because of \"user\" errors.. like the rolls stuck to a wet towel when rising.  Well... gee, no kidding?  Don't punish a great recipe because you make a basic bread making mistake!  My advice is follow the recipe as it is written and if you're an experienced enough baker, then make your own changes, but if they don't work out - don't complain!  And one more pet peeve while I'm at it.. yes, usually bread does dry out the next day.. especially home baked breads.  You give an otherwise perfect recipe 4 stars because your rolls weren't as fresh on the next day.  Oh... I'm on a rampage today!  LOL sorry!",

                "reviewBody": "These rolls were good, but taste more like an English muffin than true French bread!!The cooking time listed is WAY too long, 10-12 minutes is more accurate, or the temp needs lowered.  I cooked mine for 15 minutes while in the other room feeding my babies, and they were already starting to burn on the bottoms. They were pretty tasty, and look nice, but the recipe definitely needs some adjustments.  Maybe making a loaf instead of rolls would help?",
