I thought I'd add some suggestions as it seems some tips/alterations would make this recipe a success. If keeping the ingredients the same it is very important you let the broccoli/cheese mixture 'set' for atleast 15 minutes. I do not however suggest using breadcrumbs as I think a wet batter or wonton wrapper would work MUCH better. You will find it will no longer fall apart when frying them. I hope everyone reads this review before attempting it as is and being very disappointed!",

I used Velveta cheese with bacon bits mixed in instead of plain cheddar thinking that would melt and form better. I dipped the floret's in the cheese one-by-one and put them on waxed paper to cool a bit and congeal before rolling them in the bread crumbs. They looked great before they went into the oil. They eneded up being a disaster! The cheese all but burned they all ended up clumped together even though I only had them in the fryer a mere 3 minutes the bread crumb/cheese mixture ended up being the color of oreos. Huge waste of time and money next time I'll just buy the convenient pre-made ones in the freezer.",
