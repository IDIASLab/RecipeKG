The cream cheese frosting is used only for piping (perhaps with a star tip) around the top of the cake, outlining a pool for the whipped cream.   My suggestion is to halve the recipe for cream cheese frosting if you don't want lots of leftover frosting.  It's a beautiful cake and if you're traveling with it, easy to take the plain layers with you, then add the berries and the whipped cream and assemble it when you arrive.  Frosting comes in decorator tubes now so you could purchase that, attach a decorator tip, and then make the well for the whipped cream.\r\nVoila', easy and impressive cake!",

I also used a dash of almond extract in the cream and frosting. and used 16 ounces of cream cheese in the frosting with just a dash of buttermilk to lossen it up for pipeing. The cake was awesome.",

The cake would be perfect for Mother's Day or a little girl's birthday.  It's bright and very sweet.  Put as many strawberries as you can into this--the strawberries offset its sweetness because they are tart and make for a well-balanced dessert.  I didn't know exactly what the whipped cream was for... I put it around the outside, and it worked, but wasn't particularly necessary.  The cream cheese frosting was divine, however.",

Although the cream cheese frosting on the sides was yummy it was a little hard to ice with the whipped cream oozing out from between the layers. If you are short on time or want to cut the richness of the cake you can easily skip on the frosting. I also should have listened to my instincts and used nonstick cooking spray instead of greasing and flouring the pans per the recipe. The cake layers stuck and I had to piece them back together. For anyone who hasn't tried it I've never had a cake stick when using Pam or Mazola.",

I was a little reluctant to make this cake because of some of the reviews, but this was a fantastic cake.  I should have only used 2 pans instead of 3 because each layer came out about a half inch thick.  I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but I found the whole cake to very slidey.  Two layers definitely would have cut down on the sliding.  The taste was great!!! My husband loved it.  It is very simple to make and assemble.  The red strawberries can be formed into a maple leaf over the white icing to be even more aesthetically pleasing!  This is a wonderful summer-time cake for in season strawberries!  I will make it again for sure!",

I don't know if its the recipe or if I did something wrong. I checked the recipe again and felt that I had followed it verbatim.

To make it 3 layers I made the centre layer from a store-bought chocolate cake mix. I decorated that top with sliced strawberries and chocolate shavings (see photos of this recipe). I think that a filling other than whipped cream would work better - the whipped cream seems too light and is somewhat absorbed by the cake - a stickier vanilla icing might be better. All the trouble was worth it - it got rave reviews at a family birthday party!",
