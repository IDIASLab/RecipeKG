I like that this is made with ingredients that  I always have on hand.  In the final 5 minutes of cooking, I took it off at 2 minutes because it was starting to get pretty thick, so watch your timing.  I\u2019ll add just a bit more sugar next time, but sweetness always is something that\u2019s  a matter of personal taste.  Enjoyed and would make again, thanks for sharing.",
