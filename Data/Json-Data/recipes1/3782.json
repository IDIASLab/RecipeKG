Keys to not sticking.. Make 100% sure you grease the cups very very well. Also grease the top of the pan around the cups. Don't over fill. And make SURE you let them sit for about 20 min before removing from cups. These are really the most delicious muffins I've tasted!! Well worth the extra steps needed to keep them from sticking. They are soo very moist (the reason why they stick so easily) and AWESOME! I made them as the recipe said and wouldn't change a thing! ",
