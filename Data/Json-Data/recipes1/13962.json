Well this did not turn out very well...no \"tunnel\" at all. However was it because I did not fold in walnuts instead mixed them in with mixer? Also my new bundt pan is brown; manufacturer did not mention anything about lowering oven temperature; I believe I should have. This cake was so heavy and turned out on the dry side like a big brownie. I've looked at other versions want to try Tunnel of Fudge Cake IV next time and will lower oven temperature by 25 degrees. Just disappointed.",
