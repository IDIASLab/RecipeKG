They are supposed to be halved with seeds. Also there should be enough paprika to make the broth almost red-like 1 oz. The potatoes should be fried in the pot first for about 5 minutes like you are making home fries. Corn tortillas and lime is a great way to serve the soup. Some of the water evaporates if you cook the soup uncovered. Good Luck",

Not much flavor and certainly not worth the time it took to prepare...the potatoes took quite a while to brown and I would say prep time including the browning of the potatoes was at least a 1/2 hour or so. Actual cook time/simmer time was about 35 minutes as stated...other ratings show that others have enjoyed this recipe but we didn't like it...we ended up draining off the liquid and just having the potatoes and peppers with a dollop of sour cream..",
