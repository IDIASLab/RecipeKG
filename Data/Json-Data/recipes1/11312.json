First, half a cup of butter in the crust is excessive and I can only see that the crust would be greasy, just saturated with butter.  Half that amount worked well.  Second, when I ran the recipe by Hubs and asked for his thoughts he remarked, \u201cSounds like an awful lot of hooch to me.\u201d  My sentiments exactly \u2013 not only a lot of \u201chooch,\u201d but the boldly flavored coffee liqueur at that; 10 T. total!  Not wanting to take chances on a too boozy flavored outcome, I made some changes.  I did use the 6 T. of coffee liqueur in the chocolate filling (I used Kahlua) but I added nothing to the vanilla ice cream.  To the chocolate ice cream I added 2 T. of the more subtle Bailey\u2019s Irish Cream Liqueur and skipped the Kahlua altogether.   The Kahlua/Bailey\u2019s combination worked well together; a pleasant amount of liqueur flavor without tasting like a frozen cordial.  Also, this pie will only be as good as the ingredients you use \u2013 a homemade chocolate cookie crumb crust made with real butter, premium quality ice cream (Hubs did a fine job shopping for that for me), and fresh whipped cream.  I topped the entire pie with chocolate curls, then served each slice with a garnish of whipped cream, mint leaves and chocolate covered coffee beans.  This couldn\u2019t be a simpler dessert to prepare and you couldn\u2019t ask for prettier, more delicious results.  This may just be a redo for Christmas when the kids all come home!",

I used 5 ingredient ice-cream from this site it makes exactly 2 pints so I just added a couple of teaspoons of cocoa powder into 1 pint. It was even easier than with store bought ice-cream as I didn't have to defrost it to blend in Coffee Liqueur. Very satisfying taste though I would recommend using good commercially produced ice-cream for a creamier pie. And it is easy and impressive looking!",
