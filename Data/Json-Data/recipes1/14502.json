Instead of the diced tomatoes and tomato paste, I used tomato sauce (Ragu's Super Vegetable Primavera - added extra veggies). I also didn't precook the peppers, just stuffed them and baked them for 40 minutes. My husband ate his in what seemed like two minutes!\nHere is the exact recipe I used:\n\nDIRECTIONS\n\n1.   Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). \n2.   In a skillet over medium heat, add the turkey, Italian seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Cook the turkey or beef until no longer pink. Set aside. In same skillet, heat oil. Add onion, mushrooms, zucchini, and chopped pepper tops and cook until tender. Add spinach and stir until wilted. Return turkey to the skillet. Mix in the tomato sauce. \n3.   Place the red peppers into a square glass baking dish.  Stuff the peppers with the skillet mixture.  Add any remaining mixture to baking dish around peppers.\n4.   Bake peppers for 40 minutes.\n5.   While peppers are baking, cook pasta according to directions on box.  After draining pasta, add a bit of olive oil to keep it from sticking.\n6.   To plate, place pasta on plate and top with pepper.  Sprinkle with parmesan cheese, if desired.\n\nHope this helps - these came out perfect!",

Then if you didn't want to heat up your kitchen with the oven, just stuff with the sauted turkey, veggies,and seasonings and microwave for about 1 minute per pepper.

Ground turkey is so bland, but it really comes alive with some salt, pepper, oregano, basil, paprika, and maybe another spice that I'm missing off the top of my head. My fiance and I thought this made a great meal.",

I added some shredded carrots and used sun-dried tomato paste from a tube so I wouldn't have to open a can just for a tbsp.  Made it with red and green peppers.  The red peppers win!  Now thinking of other possiblities.  What about adjusting ingredients and serving in sweet onion shells or tomato shells instead of pepper shells?  What about compacting the turkey filling into a loaf pan, topping with tomato/cheese sauce and serving as a turkey meatloaf?  What about adding tomato sauce to the turkey mix and ladling it over a toasted mini-bagel and topping everything with a poached egg for brunch?  Warning.  Have not tried these ideas.

Sometimes, I sub in a tiny bit of other shredded veggies such as carrot, celery, or black olives, too.  Husband is a meat and potatoes guy, but he likes these with cheese and carbs on the side.
