Having said that I made these with a couple of easy and minor changes--melt the caramels with 1/3 c. evaporated milk or half and half stirring frequently. Keep warm. Place half of the batter into the pan and bake about 5 minutes then let cool a couple of minutes. Dribble the melted caramel over the top then sprinkle with 1 cup of chocolate chips (I also added a half cup off chopped nuts). Drop the remaining batter all over surface spreading together carefully with a spatula. Return to oven and bake 18-20 minutes. With this method I had a delicious fudgey brownie with a perfectly gooey and soft caramel center.",

The brownie baked up perfectly and the chocolate bars melted wonderfully. If I make this again the only change I will make is to melt the caramels down before pouring them over the chocolate bars since they did not melt down during baking but instead maintained their cube shape. Melting the caramel down will allow it to be more evenly distributed. Also I only had room in my 13x9 pan for 6 chocolate bars even though the recipe calls for 8. I used plain Hershey bars.",
