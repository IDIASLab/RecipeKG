I tried making this recipe a little healthier by substituting applesauce for the oil, but the granola bars just got a funny chewy texture to them.  I also decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 c and I like the sweetness a little more.  I think next time I'll make 1/4 c oil & 1/4 c applesauce.  Otherwise, this is such a great recipe, don't change it if you don't want to! (I'm a nutrition major so I always try to make recipes healthier, but it may take away from the original results.) Thanks for the great recipe, Ilene!",

You can also omit the white or wheat flour by substituting OAT FLOUR instead - they still taste delicious. They are a little firmer this way, which I like, so be sure to add 2 eggs instead of 1. I also substituted flax meal for wheat germ. Best with lots of chocolate chips and dried berries! My husband asks for this every week. Thanks!",

Don't put too much weight on my mention of the brown sugar though ---- because I always lower the sugar content for my little who's only 2 yrs old. I try to make healthy snacks for her with just a touch of sweetness not too much! So we use 1/4 cup brown sugar but we still use ALL the honey! They are slightly moist and chewy and can be made with such a variety of nuts and dried fruits that it can always be a different batch than before!! Thanks for a terrific recipe.",

We made 2 batches of 6 different combinations and ended up with 540 granola bars which we individually wrapped and froze. My family went through our half in a month and a half!! They are great in lunches or after school snacks. Here are the combinations we used: crushed oreo recess pieces with peanuts mixed dried fruit with sunflower seeds and coconut (sunshine bars) craisins and almonds s'mores toffee & mini chocolate chips. Some were a litte chewier than others but all of them were delicious!! Todays new combination is nutter butter cookies with peanut butter chips on top. yummy!!!",

I often use up whatever open packages are left after other baking, our favorites are choc chips, raisins, slivered almonds, craisins, coconut & M&Ms.  I often use corn syrup instead of honey.  I sometimes substitute old fashioned oats for 1/2 the quick oats.  I have recently started adding 1/3 C dry milk powder and think I will always make them that way now.  I only cook them 20 minutes.",
