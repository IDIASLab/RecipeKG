Comes out almost as perfect as the original cake, and less guilt! :-)",

It doesn't rise much at all at least mine didn't and I thought I did something wrong but it wasn't even an issue once everyone tasted it. As one reviewer mentioned it only needs about 1 and half minutes under the broil that was very useful to know I kept a watchful eye on it and it was perfect I didn't serve it warm because I always make my cakes a day ahead of time I find the cakes taste better and it's one less thing to prepare the day of the dinner party. I did use less nutmeg then the recipe (half) called for that was the only other change I made. Thank you for this recipe I love oatmeal so this will become a favorite of mine.",
