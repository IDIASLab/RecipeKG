Though easy to make, any one of three things can degrade the result so heed the following:  If you don\u2019t have the brandy, don\u2019t bother making the recipe - it's still ok, but brandy pulls out some vital flavor in this mix.  Use a good fine zester and avoid the white part of the rind, which means you may need about 8 medium sized oranges.  Finally, don\u2019t undercook or overcook the sauce and you're most likely to undercook it (helpful huh?)  Oh, in my opinion the sauce benefits from resting at least one day before serving.",

Frozen cranberries are fine, just rinse immediately before use, no need to thaw.  I also like to add 1/4 teaspoon orange oil along with the brandy at the end. I recommend using a medium saucepan to avoid overboil.  This is fabulous on top of Brie.  Mix 8 oz cranberry sauce, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon Meyer's dark rum and 1/4 teaspoon fresh grated nutmeg.  Spread this mixture evenly on top of an 8 oz Brie round that has some rind trimmed from the top (leaving a 1/3 inch border on top).  Sprinkle with some chopped pecans on top and bake Brie at 500 degrees for 5 minutes.  Great served with water crackers and apple and pear slices.  If you don't want to use rum, you can substitute orange juice.  Enjoy!",

ENJOY!!  you will! **review update:  I tried this again for Christmas and didn't have any brandy so I used Liquor 43 (a vanilla liquor), it was just as OUTSTANDING....  also, I used about 1/4 cup of zest and it was just as good!",

Zest is not enormously long strings that need to be picked out or cut up. Use a zester. It benefits from being cooked too long but not cooking long enough will not enhance it. Don't worry that you might be cooking it too long. Take a little time don't change anything and it will be well worth it. By the way rind and zest are not the same thing this recipe should not contain any rind only zest. It takes a bunch (8 or so) oranges to do this right and the particles of zest will be small and will blend with the cranberries if done right. Its worth the effort.",
