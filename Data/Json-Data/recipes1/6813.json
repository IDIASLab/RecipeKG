Some prep tips:  Let the goat cheese come to room temperature before trying to pipe it into the figs.  It will make your life much easier!  Fill the figs as full as you can.  It's hard to tell how much cheese you've put in and I wish I had put more.  If you insert the tip of the pastry bags deep into the fig then squeeze as you slowly pull it out, you will have a nice even amount of cheese all through the fig.  I also wrapped mine in proscuitto which was fabulous!  I forgot to drizzle the honey and it was still wonderful and since it wasn't sticky, they could be eaten as finger food.  I sliced each fig in half and arranged them on a platter.  I also cut off the hard stems so my  guests wouldn't have to.  Try this, it's a winner!",

Hoping to squeeze 1TB of cheese inside was wishful thinking at best.:( In my version I added chopped fresh thyme and cracked black pepper to the cheese wrapped them in prosciutto and skewered them on rosemary stalks before grilling. For presentation I served them on a bed of red-wine vinaigrette-dressed micro greens with a honey and balsamic reduction drizzle;)",

I don't have a piping bag grape leaves or a grill so I made fig \"sandwiches\" by cutting the figs part-way through and spreading goat cheese inside with a knife. Then I broiled them cut-side up. I stuffed walnuts inside after they came out and before topping with honey. One caution: don't use too creamy of a goat cheese. Mine got a little greasy with a triple creme cheese.",
