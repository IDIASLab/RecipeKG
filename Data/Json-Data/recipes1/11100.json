It most likely will also be the last time, as the quality of the ice cream suffers for it.  Unlike the fresh dairy taste, richness, creaminess and velvety-smooth mouth feel you get from using using heavy cream and half-and-half or milk, this is more like ice milk and has somewhat of an icy graininess to it by comparison. Also, I found the little frozen chunks of fruit (I used strawberries) and the \"canned\" taste of the sweetened condensed milk unappealing - and I can think of nothing to support using it. This experiment with making ice cream with the condensed milk proved to me once again that using fresh ingredients is almost always best.",
