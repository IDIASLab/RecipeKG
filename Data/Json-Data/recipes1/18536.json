The 3 ingredients all take on the dressing in their own way with the zucchini absorbing it the most. I did thread my meat and veggies separate because that is the way it needs to be done with a lot of kabob recipes to guarantee perfect doneness for the meat but not overdoing the veggies but I don't think it was necessary for this recipe. They seemed to all get done at the same time. Perfect for summertime grilling and super simple with no fuss.",
