I used wheat pita pockets, and they just really soaked up the olive oil. I baked for 5 minutes and they came out perfect! **Update** I made these again, and I used less olive oil because instead of cutting the pita pockets into triangles and then brushing them with the olive oil mixture, I only cut them in half, and then I brushed them. After each was covered I cut into triangles. This was SOOO much easier and less time consuming!",

                "reviewBody": "The recipe never said exactly HOW to cut the pita into 8 pieces and, to me, this made all the difference.  First, I cut it like a pie with 8 pieces (leaving the two layers of pita).  I had to bake for 15 minutes (flipping the pitas once) to get a crispy effect.  The next time, I cut it lengthwise and then into 4 thin pieces (yielding a total of 8) and cooked for 7 minutes.  Each came out well, but I guess it's a matter of preference.  The first way, chips are thicker, the second way, they are thinner and crispier.  Also, I found it easier to sprinkle the herb mixture.  When I dipped the pitas in the oil, some pieces had a lot more seasoning than others.  Still, they were a great hit and tasted delicious.",

I baked all the \"thin\" halves in one batch and all the \"thick\" halves in one batch.  I omitted olive oil and just sprayed wedges with olive oil cooking spray.  I combined the spices as stated in the recipe in a small bowl and sprinkled these on and then one more quick spray to make sure everything stayed put.  My guests loved them and they disappeard quickly.  My kids thought they were better than potato chips...what a healthy, fat-free snack for them.  Thanks for sharing.
