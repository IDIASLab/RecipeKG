Instead of 2 cups of sugar I did as was suggested by another and used 1-1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I used Crisco butter shortening, omitted the cloves and nutmeg and used only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon (personal preference) I used pecans instead of walnuts and I only had five bananas but apparently they were good size ones cause the bread was very banana tasting. I got A LOT of compliments and I will definitely make this again!!  I put it in smaller loaf pans making 8 and for a variation on it - the batter for the last four pans I added milk chocolate chips which was more popular than the 'plain'. If you are going to make this - try the milk chocolate chips - totally awesome.",

I did leave out some of the spices because I happen to be allergic to nutmeg and don't care too much for the taste of cloves but this is still THE most delicious and absolute moistest banana bread I have ever eaten in my life!
