I thought from the rest of the reviews they would be thin like crepes but heaven's no and just delicious. The only flour in these is the flour in the starter. I made my first batch of starter from a Family Recipe yesterday and used it this morning. So old starter may have had a stronger sourdough flavor. I made these using my very thick gloppy starter so the 3/4 cup may have been a cup full or almost. This isn't a science either. I use a cast iron griddle that covers 2 stove burners and used my 2oz Stainless Scoop as a measure. I got 9 pancakes 4 1/2- 5\" pancakes. My picky adult Son said these are good Mom. Keep this recipe. They did puff up in the centers and just like all pancakes flattened down as they cooled a bit. This recipe was very easy and quick to make and no problems and certainly these pancakes are not flat. Different starters such as the runny ones will make a difference in that case then add a bit of flour to a thicker consistency. Flavor and texture are nearly as good as any other pancake on the market.We ususally always use Krusteaz and I have to thin that alot to get the batter to spread out. This is a Keeper.",

People may be using starter with different water/flour ratios and and different stages of the feeding cycle. \n\nThat being said, mine were DELECTABLE. My starter was 1:1 (or in bread baker's terms, 100% hydration). I took 100 g of the starter out of the fridge the evening before, at dinner time. I added 100 g water and 100 g flour. It was very thick. By the next morning (about 12 hours later), it had increased about 50% in volume. It was almost gloppy in consistency. I measured out 3/4 cup for the recipe. \n\nAfter combining all of the ingredients EXCEPT the water, I judged that the consistency was perfect, and it was. The pancakes rose nicely and had a great consistency. I made two plain ones so I could sample the taste, then I even added blueberries into the \"wet side\" 30 seconds after pouring the next batch onto the griddle. The consistency was strong enough to hold the blueberries half submerged. Just fabulous. I meant to take a picture of the remaining one, but it was no longer \"remaining\" when I got back to the table with the camera. Next time.",

A bit sweeter than Krusteez, but I liked that, and the sourdough tang was definitely there, but it was not overpowering. I will make these again.
