After a few hours, and learning what order I preferred, this is what I came up with.  For 12 jars, you will need to have 5 lbs W.Sugar, 4-10oz choc chips, 2-17.6oz M&M's, 1 large container of oats, 2-32oz B.Sugar, 2-5 lb bags of flour.  You will have left overs, but this will allow you to work like an assembly line, doing all the jars one ingredient at a time without running our of anything.  The order I used was as follows: W.Sugar, 1/2 cup M&M's, crispy rice, 1/2 cup swirled choc chips, oats, B.Sugar, Baking soda, Baking Powder, and finally flour.  Remember to pack down the filling jar after each ingredient is added, it will all fit very nicely!! Oh yeah, the cookies taste wonderful--I made some to keep in my own pantry!!!!",

Other than that the reverse laying is the best and the cookie shape was great. I gave them out as party favors and I had fun making and baking them.",

I used a plastic spatula to pack down after a few layers (layered sugar first then oats choc. chips crispies white choc. chips brown sugar then soda baking powder and flour). I used the regular jars and a funnel for canning jars. The cookies were not thin at all..came out perfect! (I used my medium 2 tablespoon scoop from Pampered Chef..uniform cookies and perfect shape and thickness.) They were a hit with everyone I gave them to..presented as Christmas gifts..in a gift bag I added the cookie jar (the lid covered with fabric and secured with twine) a wooded spoon with a twine ribbon attached and a set of matching holiday pot holders. For an added personal touch I also put in the bag a small box of flavored tea or small bag of gourmet coffee. It was great! Thanks for sharing this recipe Linda!",

Halfway through the gruelling (ha!) taste testing hit on the idea of adding about 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips. Eureka! I skipped the fabric circle decoration just tied a wooden spoon and handwritten directions to each with rough twine. A bachelor friend says he's just keeping it as is to impress women.
