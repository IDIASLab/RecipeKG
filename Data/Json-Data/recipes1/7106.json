I put the cookies in a bag and broke them with my hands. I left the pieces pretty large -- I broke each cookie into about 4 or 5 pieces. I like oreos to be really big and recognizable when I use them in recipes (like homemade ice cream brownies and cakes). I made the cookies pretty large. Ended up with about 28 or 30. When you make them large flatten out the dough a bit rather than making them into round balls. You don't want them to be too flat just not round. The refrigeration step is important since the dough it kind of sticky. The cookie dough isn't the same as a chocolate chip cookie dough. it is a cross between a sugar cookie and a chocolate chip cookie. My cookies didn't come out hard at all. they were fairly soft.",

You expected it would be good or you wouldn't have made it but it turns out even better than you expected! I made the recipe as written no changes. However as I do with all cookie doughs made with butter I let the dough chill for an hour or so until somewhat firm. I used a medium sized cookie scoop (about 1/4 c.) flattened them slightly and baked on UNgreased cookie sheets for 12 minutes. Buttery Oreo-y delicious. Crispy on the edges soft and chewy in the middle. When I make these again I will fold even more Oreos in at the last left in chunkier pieces. I can't wait to share these!",

It not only makes them look nicer it adds an extra kick of flavor to a sugar-cookie-like recipe. Depending on how much chocolate coating you want mix a tablespoon of shortening with every 9 ounces of semisweet chocolate you use melt in a double boiler dip cookies and place on a cooling rack over aluminum foil to catch drips. Let the chocolate harden completely!! Yum!",
