Instead of shortening, I used applesauce to make these muffins a little more healthier (i'm all about that). Also, I substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour instead of a whole cup of all purpose flour. As suggested by other users, I decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp and added a tsp of vanilla. Also, I sprinkled some oats and cinnamon sugar on the tops of the muffins while they were baking to give them a little extra flavor and look. In the end, these bran muffins came out delicious and full of flavor!",
