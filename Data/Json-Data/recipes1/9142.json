I used onion garlic mushrooms carrots and canned tomatoes for the veggie mix. I also used only about 2.5 cups liquid to make the barley. For spice I used salt pepper onion powder garlic powder cayenne and some smoked paprika for both flavor and a very nice deep red color. I'll definately add this to my repetoire of whole grain entrees. Thanks!",
