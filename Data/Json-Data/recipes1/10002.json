Added sliced carrots during last 10 minutes. Used about 2/3 bunch fresh spinach and wilted in pot. Also added pinch of nutmeg with the spinach and flavor was incredible. Serves 4 over rice. Very filling and a different flavor to help shake up dinnertime. Meateaters won't even notice it's vegetarian it's so hearty. Will put in my dinner rotation.",
