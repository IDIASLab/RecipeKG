I used a deep dish pie shell & poured all the filling in one shell I halved the meringue ingredients & I did use 1 & 1/2 cups of blueberries but I think that needs to be decreased by half a cup. Next time I may try using frozen blueberries... I think the fresh had a little more crunch than they ideally should. I garnished w/ a bed of crushed lemon drop candies a tiny sprig of mint & several blueberries. Beautiful & yummy!",
