So it is a nice light cake with lots of ginger sparkle. And I didn't even add the fresh ginger the recipe called for--just the powdered ginger. It was quite a hit with my guests. I made an orange glaze for the cake, but really...it was pointless. One: it didn't need any embellishment, and two: the orange taste was totally overruled by the ginger flavor. Go the powedered sugar route as she says. Thank you Margorita Whyte for a wonderful recipe!!",

Anyway, I made a glaze of 1/2 stick melted butter, 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and about 3 Tbsp ginger brandy and poured it over the top.  It was great!!!

I think those who thought it was just don't like spices in that family all that much. Anyway if there is a spice \"problem \" it may be the cinnamon - too much of it. It wasn't really identifiable as cinnamon but more distracting from the ginger. Mine came out kinda dry but my pan was larger so I'm taking the blame. I topped with a vanilla glaze & I think it needs more sugar in the cake itself - or maybe dark brown as suggested. A good cake to have with coffee.
