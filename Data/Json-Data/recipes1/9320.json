It was awesome!! I highly recommend adding the tofu.",

I like to chop up a bit of shallot and saute it a little in the olive oil- maybe a touch of minced garlic clove as well and then toss in the couscous and coat that too. Then the water (plus definitely a chicken boullioun cube). A touch of salt- up to you. Couscous is an eastern staple so add some easterny flavours when simmering. Add a pinch of cinnamon or turmeric or whatever. Like peas? Mix some in while simmering. I also like to add a bit of chopped green onion. Tease it any way you want but do something with it- just hints of this or that or it will be bland. And oh yeah- I did enjoy the recipie.",
