While the it was baking I marinated slices of tomatoes in fat-free italian dressing and place them on top of each piece of eggplant along with the cheese and some fresh basil, then baked another few minutes. I left out the oil completely. What a wonderfully  flavored low fat side that will go with anything. I served it with grilled salmon and fresh spinach. Will definately make again!!",

Kept the tomatoes as slices instead of chopping; also added some garlic powder and Italian seasoning (just sprinkled on). Baked the eggplant before putting on the other toppings; also flipped them over so they would be the same texture on both sides. Used Italian breadcrumbs. Very filling recipe -- we didn't have room in our tummies for the main course after eating these.",
