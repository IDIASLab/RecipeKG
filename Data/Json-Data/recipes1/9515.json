I changed the recipe somewhat by using fresh strawberries (approximately 2 cups of pureed fresh strawberries). I also used an entire 26-ouncer of vodka to make this more of a \"drink\" drink:-). I have made other slush recipes before great summertime drinks. This one is an excellent way to use up fresh picked strawberries at the beginning of the season. I serve it in a ratio of 1 part slush to 1 part 7-up. You can adjust the ratio to suit your taste.",
