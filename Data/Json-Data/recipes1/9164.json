Thank you so much for submitting this, it's absolutely easy & my early teen daughter will be whipping this up for us often!!!\n*NOTE* glass pie pans take 5-8 minutes longer so don't open the oven door until you've made the adjustment!

I added chopped ham and a bit of parmesean.  I also used mozerella.  I used whole wheat flour but you could not tell in the final product.  I did have to cook it longer but did not have to broil.  Crispy skin was already on the top.  Easiest quiche I have ever made.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I don't want anyone to get too excited, but this may be my favorite recipe EVER.  I love quiche the way most people love Christmas. However, quiche is unfortunately loaded with fat and calories and all sorts of bad stuff, meaning it's way off my diet. :-/  NOW I CAN EAT QUICHE EVERY DAY, because this recipe, while preserving the general awesomeness of quiche, cuts out the cream AND the butter-filled crust, leaving only diet-worthy deliciousness. I made only two changes; I cut out the two tablespoons of butter, and I like my quiche a little \"thick\" so I changed one-half cup of milk to plain unsweetened yogurt (I put the yogurt in one cup of milk and mixed well before adding to the flour). This made the texture a little \"richer\" without adding calories or fat.  I really, really love you for this recipe. Really.",
