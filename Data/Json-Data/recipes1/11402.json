The only changes I made were to substitute garlic powder for the garlic salt and I added a bit of dill and a bit of salt-free lemon pepper to the spice mix. I added some fresh squeezed lime juice (from a quarter of a leftover lime) in with the lemon juice/butter. I baked the grouper for 10 minutes @350 then broiled for about 5 minutes to finish it off nicely. My fillets were thick. I loved the mayo/paprika topping too and added some fresh chopped parsley over the fish. My room mate loved this dish too. Thank you Shirley this one is a keeper!",

The directions didn't mention broiling (although you prepared it in a broiler pan), so after baking for 10 minutes, I spread with mayo & sprinkled with paprika, then broiled for 2-3 minutes to lightly \"crisp.\"  \n  a VERY GOOD recipe!
