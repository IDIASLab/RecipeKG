I like green pepper but it was too prominent in what is a mild-flavored soup. I added 1/2 cup of Guiness Draught but I don't think that necessarily made this any better - this soup would have been good with or without it. For the record Hubs disagreed with me on the green pepper thing even suggesting it only added to the \"Green and Gold.\" (okaaaay...) To ensure the cheese doesn't curdle or separate remove the soup from the heat before stirring it in slowly and gradually.",
