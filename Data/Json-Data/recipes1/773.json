They are meant to have that \"sweet and salty\" taste so if that turns you off don't add so much salt. The baking powder also adds to the saltiness so adjust the amount of salt to your taste. Make sure you thoroughly mix the oats in so that all of it is coated with the butter/sugar mixture and really press it down into the pan. I lined my pan with foil which works very well for this recipe. And yes it's even better with a teaspoon or so of vanilla.",

I doubled the recipe but divided the mixture in two parts and baked each separately. I used regular butter and only 1/4 tsp. salt total. It was perfect for my taste. I used shortening to grease the pans. I made sure the oats were completely and thoroughly mixed with the sugar mixture. I pressed it firmly down into the pan. Baked at exactly 400 degrees (per my oven thermometer)for 9 minutes. The last line of the recipe says \"Cut while hot.\" This will result in a crumbled mess. Instead I waited about 7 minutes and then scored the cookies. When the pan was completely cool I removed the bars easily with no breakage. It seemed like the cooler they became the easier they were to handle. Will definitely make this again. My husband is inhaling them now. Thanks Mandy and Lisa. These are fast frugal and fabulous!",

I also used a 10x15 rimmed baking sheet (jelly roll pan) instead of the 9x13 pan. It took a while to firmly pat the dough to cover the pan but the tiny spaces remaining filled in during cooking. I cooked exactly 9 minutes and the dough still looked kind of molten when I took it out of the oven but hardened while it cooled. A couple of pointers--use a really non-stick baking pan or these will stick and cut and remove from pan while still warm or they will break apart. They cool very quickly. Next time I make them I might bake them only 8 minutes so they'll be a tad less brittle. I have not tried making this recipe following the directions exactly but doing it \"my way\" turned out great! These are really a grown up kind of cookie instead of a kid snack.",
