So I tried to make up with it when I did the feeling by doubling the sugar&cinnamon (which was GREAT) it made it gooey like a cinnamon roll. I would also cook it at a lower temp because mine was golden but somewhat doughy still. And I didn't use the frosting because all I could tast was the powdered sugar. Otherwise I think it was easy and still good!Next time I will just modify it and probably do a light glaze on top.",

Also before baking she turned the roll completely upwards So each roll browned and after the icing she put a half a maraschino cherry on top. Very festive looking. !  Miss my MOM.
