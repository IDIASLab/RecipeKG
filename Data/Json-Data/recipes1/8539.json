However I didn't like the idea of chopped almonds mixed into the filling so I toasted sliced almonds and covered the cool baked crust with them before adding the filling. Most important I found the currant jelly glaze a little thick and gloppy so the next time I make this (and I know there will be MANY next times) I'll thin the jelly out with a bit of water to make it more glaze-like and easier to spread.",

Stick 'em in a bag and use the side of your meat tenderizer to \"chop\" them. Then no cutting but still small almonds!:) Try this recipe you won't be disappointed. DEFINITELY add the almond extract and some almonds it makes the pie!! There is just one thing to say - WOW! WOW! We were SO impressed with this we've made it again and again! I too cheated and used the graham cracker crust - the filling was quick easy and most of all DELICIOUS!! I used extra strawberries when serving this they give this just the perfect combo in the mouth. YUM!",
