Honestly I thought cooking the chops in butter on the stove and then baking them for 25 minutes longer would result in completely over-cooked chops but they were perfect. The gravy took me longer than directed but I am gravy challenged so that might have been my fault. Regardless, the gravy was rich and flavorful and complimented the chops perfectly. Excellent recipe and 5 stars all the way!",

Apparently doubling the sauce was not necessary; however I now have enough sauce to freeze so that next time I only need to brown and bake the pork chops. The only changes made were not using white wine since I was out of it (just subbed with some beef broth). I do like my sauce pretty thick so I used more flour/broth mixture for thickening. And as I always do added twice the amount of mushrooms...because you can never have enough mushrooms!",

It lacked flavor.\n\nBut, seeing the potential I just made it again with a few changes.  First, I seasoned the meat w/ salt, pepper, cajun seasoning and browned the chops in the skillet.  Pulled the chops, added the garlic, shallots, mushrooms and 1tbsp of butter.  Cooked a couple minutes, then added the white wine (probably 1/3 cup).  Once the pan was deglazed, added the broth and bouillon.  I did add a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  Oh yea!  Flavor town!  Seasoning the meat before cooking made all the difference.",
