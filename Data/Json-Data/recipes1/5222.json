The topping was a bit cheesier than I would like so I will use less cheese and more sour cream next time. Thanks for a good recipe!",

Don't let the simplicity turn you away, these are great. If they're too mild for your taste, you can easily jazz them up by adding spices to the chicken or adding a spicy enchilada sauce. I did add a can of mild enchilada sauce before adding the cheese to the top as someone suggested, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.",

It is not a substitution for real enchiladas, but it is a great casserole for those picky eaters!  I used grilled chicken breast, which added a nice flavor to the filling.  As for the topping, I had no trouble preparing the cheese sauce as some other reviewers mentioned.  It melted to a smooth consistency, but perhaps they added all the cheese at once instead of by small handfuls.  I also added just a small amount of green chile enchilada sauce over the enchiladas prior to topping with the cheese sauce.  I would definitely make this again!",

After the initial try, I made it again with changes (some from other reviewers, some of my own) and it is now my DH's favorite. Here is what I did...Cooked 2 chicken breasts in about 2c chicken broth in slow cooker for about 5 hours, removed from liquid  then shredded. Put shredded chicken in pan, added one packet of taco seasoning and required water, and cooked until no liquid remained. I then followed the recipe and blended the chicken, 3/4c cheddar, 1/2c sour cream, and added 1/4c cottage cheese. I used wheat tortillas, and filled them generously and still got 9 instead of 8. I used one can of enchilada sauce to pour over enchiladas, then topped with just shredded cheddar and tomatoes. Cooked as suggested, but covered for the last 7-8 minutes, let sit for about 10 minutes and served topped with sour cream. My husband gave my version 5 stars (but he has to be nice if he wants me to keep making him dinner ;-) ) I think that the cubed chicken, and the lack of enchilada sauce were my biggest turn-offs about the original recipe. In my version, the chicken is juicy, and the enchiladas are not dry at all. I'm glad that I found the recipe - the filling is great (with shredded chicken).",

I prepared the filling as written though I did saute the onion first. It's in the sauce that I had to deviate. I poured green enchilada sauce over the enchiladas topped them with shredded cheese then baked leaving off the tomatoes and olives (only because I didn't have either). This was a nice treat for him and while not enchiladas with much dimension they sure were good in a pinch when I was trying to empty out the fridge before a trip! Actually I think the green enchilada sauce probably gave them a little more flavor anyway!",
