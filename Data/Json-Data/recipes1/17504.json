I doubled the recipe but only used 1 tsp of horseradish because the only kind in my frig was EXTRA HOT...which I use for cocktail sauce. I used combo of Dijon and Stoneground Brown mustard. It needed a little dash of sour for our taste and to cut the sweetness...so I put a teaspoon of key lime juice.  I also think this would make an awesome ham glaze with some honey or brown sugar added to it.",

I was a little concerned because I'm not a big fan of orange marmalade but the stone ground mustard did a great job of toning down the sweet and the horseradish brought a nice punch to go with all that sweet of coconut and marmalade. I did go a little heavy with the extra hot horseradish which worked for us that love the heat. Not generally an aesthetic guy but the stone ground mustard did a nice job of toning down the bright orange. I'm sure dijon would work but if you have the time get the stone ground. Just a better flavor here.",
