I cut into the cupcakes I made from this batter with trepidation! But no worries this cake is GOOD! Light fluffy and soft VERY moist and kind of a milk-chocolate color it was a nice change from heavier denser darker chocolate cakes. Didn't change a thing and wouldn't in the future either. I frosted it with \"Peanut Butter Frosting \" also from this site and it was a beautiful combination both in color and in taste.",

It was extremely thin the color was odd and it just seemed as if I'd missed a step as I'd made the cake batter. As I pulled it out of the oven it looked perfect! I frosted this cake with my own recipe for Chocolate Buttermilk Buttercream. I did not try this cake myself but my husband and kids raved about it all night last night.

It's been my go-to chocolate cake recipe for many years, and never once did it fail to turn out and garner many compliments, as well as moans of near-ecstasy. From experience, I can tell you that both the taste and texture is slightly better when you use the actual buttermilk, as opposed to using fresh milk with added lemon juice or vinegar to sour it.  But if that's all you have, rest assured it will still turn out very well - just a matter of tiny degrees, certainly not a deal breaker. It has a perfect chocolate flavor, and a moist, fine, velvety crumb. It stays moist for days, if kept covered (but it probably won't last long enough for you to put that to the test!) Frosted either with chocolate or vanilla buttercream (or even a whipped ganache,) this is a sure-fire winner that delivers dependably outstanding results.",

Hershey's calls for 2 1/4 cups of flour 1 1/2 tsp. baking soda and 1/2 tsp. salt. Made according to Hershey's recipe and use real butter for the shortening and buttermilk not sour milk and it is fabulous. I use the buttercream icing and store the cake in the refrigerator. It is rich chocolaty and delicious. I just bake in a 9x13 pan and it turns out fine.",
