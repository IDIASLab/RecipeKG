This recipe tastes very similar to how they eat it over there. Yummy! I changed the recipe slightly so it was ready after about 35 Minutes of simmering. I used regular old stew meat from the store, browned it along with the chopped onion for a few minutes, then let it rest for 5 minutes while I finished preparing the veggies. I made sure to chop my carrots into smaller pieces since I knew I wouldn't be cooking them for 4 hours. I cut the beets into cube like, solid chunks, and used a half a red cabbage.  I then combined all ingredients, brought to a boil, reduced heat to simmering and 35 minutes later had the Yummiest soup ever. The Bay leaves and sour cream can't be skipped. I added 4 leaves. You are going to have to add a lot more salt than you think you may - the cabbage and beats really suck up the flavoring. I also used some Montreal Steak seasoning - that's powerful stuff and I used 2 tablespoons plus a lot of salt.",

I used everything in your recipe but cooked the beef shanks in the crock pot for seven hours, removed the meat and strained the broth. Refridgerated overnight and was able to remove the solidified fat from the top.  Cooked onions,carrots,celery and 4 whole beets in electric pressure cooker for 20 min. When done I removed the beets, peeled them and cut into matchsticks. Used the immersion blender on the remaining vegetables, added the broth,meat and beets. Added vinegar to taste.  Amazing!!!! So even though my technique was a little different it was basically your recipe!  Thank you so much!!!!!!",
