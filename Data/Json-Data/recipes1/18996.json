Since turkey is such a lean meat/protein I would suggest using the ground turkey that is 93/7. I put the formed burgers in the freezer for about 30 minutes. This made the burgers firm and we had no problem with the burgers falling apart while on the grill. The grilled pineapple adds the sweet while the cheese adds the saltly/savory. Cheddar cheese is what we use however I am looking to try another type cheese just to switch it up a bit.",
