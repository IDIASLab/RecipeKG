I find that a hand mixer works best when blending the powdered sugar in. This icing is very sticky just keep that in mind! I transfer the icing after blending into a pastry bag and I pipe it onto the cupcake. Make sure you don't put too much onto the cupcake because it spreads out more so if the icing is still warm. If yoou let it cool it will hold it's shape better. Just make sure you mix it well if you decide to let it cool so the icing is smooth. I also tend to pipe my icing on thicker so I only get about 15 cupcakes covered with this recipe but you may get more than that. If you need to frost more cupcakes make you double the recipe to accomodate your needs. Yes this is sweet yes the icing is thick and sticky to work with. I really highly recommend using this on the Cookie Dough Cupcakes from this site. Please follow the recipe before winging it and rating it badly. Like I mentioned keep in mind this is sweet and not a fluffy icing before you make it.",

I just read Pam-3boysMama's review after seeing her photo: I think it's a great tip to let the icing come to room temperature so it holds a swirl. It looks prettier than the glaze that just oozes down the sides. Overall fun recipe to try just didn't pack the flavor I wanted/expected.",

Didn't measure the powdered sugar just added and mixed with a hand mixer until it was the consistency I wanted. Even after chilling in the fridge it coats the cupcakes more like a glaze than a frosting.
