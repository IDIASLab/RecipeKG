To do so, do the following:\n1.  Mix yeast and water and let stand for 5 minutes.\n2.  Add melted margarine and honey (ie. the liquids) to the mixture and then your dry ingredients, saving the salt for the last ingredient.\n3.  Form a soft dough, and cover bowl with a wet cloth and let rise in a warm place (or the oven set on 200 degrees and then turned off) for about an hour.  4.  Take the dough and knead it.  Put dough in bread tin and again cover with a wet cloth and let rise for about 1/2 hour in a warm place.\n5.  Cook at directed.\n\nI altered the recipe slightly, adding 1 tbsp of sugar and using a combination of 1.5 cups wheat flour and the remaining cup white flour.  It turned out beautifully.",

I usually make it in a loaf pan and cut off enough of the dough to make 4 buns as the dough rises quite high in the loaf pan. This makes a large high loaf of bread in the normal sized loaf pan. I make the buns big enough for a hamburger. I'm not sure why the one critic says the loaf is not big - perhaps didn't let it rise long enough! It sometimes is sticky coming out of the bread maker so I roll it around on the board in some flour. Enjoy!!",
