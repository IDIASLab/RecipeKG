I do not recommend putting any paprika on the top layer though mine burned.",

I made 4 layers with a different type of cheese in each layer. I had something else in the oven so cooked it at 350 degrees. My husband had 4 helpings! It turned out a little runny so I will have to experiment to see if different types of cheese will help there or more flour. Regardless this recipe is a keeper for me.",
