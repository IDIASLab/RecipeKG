This time instead of a caked which would have to be pulled apart or cut, I made these into balls. The half batch made 10 good sized balls. Before forming the balls I sprayed my hands with butter flavored cooking spray. I place each ball on it's own square of waxed paper and after it's cooled I wrap it up and tape it shut. It's easy to transport and I use the wax paper to hold on so my hands don't get sticky. \n\nI used more m&m's than the recipe called for. Instead of popping corn, I used a bag of microwave popcorn, which worked well. One regular sized bag would make a half batch, two would make a whole batch. The 94% fat free healthy pop or the Crispy and White kind work great because they are not greasy. \n\nIf you wanted to dress this up for a bake sale or school treat you could drizzle the cake or balls with melted chocolate or cover in sprinkles for kids. Either would be fabulous!",

I used 2 large casserole dishes instead of a big bowl because my \"big\" bowl didn't really leave mixing room after all the dry ingredients were in. We sprayed our hands with non stick spray and just grabbed handfuls and filled the bundt pan. With a little alteration this could be really fantastic!",
