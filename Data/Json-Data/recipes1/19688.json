I checked the bison council website and they recommend searing the meat stove top and cooking at 225 - so that is what I did. The Bison tenderloin was so tender you could cut it with a fork and the Cherry Onion chutney made a lovely addition.",

Then I preheated my grill leaving an area for indirect heat. I seared the loin on all sides and then moved it to indirect heat (300 degrees) for about an hour with an internal temperature of 135. The Chutney was really good and the perfect compliment. Though it doesn't say in the recipe when to add the onions back into the cherry mixture no big deal I just added them back in a little bit before I put the pears in and it turned out great. I will definitely do this again for company or a special occasion.",
