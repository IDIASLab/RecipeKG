The only time that ever happens is if the potatoes to cooked for to long. They still need to be slightly firm. Another review about the sour cream seperating. If your flour, butter and milk becomes to hot and then you add cold sour cream to it you can curdle it and that can cause seperation. Food for thought. :) Delicious soup.",

I did not have onions on hand but I did have green onions so I added those to the potatoes and had them boil with the potatoes( I boiled the potatoes instead of microwaving them), because I do not like crunchy onions in my soup. But it really did taste like a baked potato.  I topped it with crumbled bacon and extra cheese.  We will be making this allot for those cold winter nights. It is a great comfort food!",

If you change ingredients you have made a totally different recipe and it is not fair to rate! Anyhow I followed the recipe per directions with the exception of boiling potatoes instead of microwaving. Everything seemed great until I added the sour cream. The sour cream separated from the soup and was a big mess! Neither my husband nor I could get through it. Threw the whole pan out. I wouldn't suggest this recipe to anyone - big waste of time!!",

I improvised a little and here were my changes: After adding the milk to the butter/flour cooked mixture (or roux) I added the seasoning packet from Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice (the Original Recipe). It has 23 Herbs and Seasoning and made quite a tasty addtion to the flavor of this soup! I added 1 cup of cheddar cheese instead of 1/2 cup too. Other than those additions I kept the recipe the same. It was sooooooooooooo good! Then I served it with real bacon bits and cheddar cheese on the side for those who wanted to add them. It was a hit and I will make this again for sure. Next time I want to add some cut up and cooked baby carrots to add more color and vitamins.",

First of all I prefer to boil the cubed potatoes vs microwaving them.  They can cook while you do step 2.  Second, after melting the butter, saute the onions until they are translucent and very soft.  This will take the crunch factor out and add lots of flavor to the party.  Third, when you whisk in the flour, continue whisking and cooking for a few minutes or until it is a blonde color.  You're making a roux and it won't properly thicken the soup unless cook the flour.  Once finished I served with an extra small dollop of sour cream, cheese, scallions and real bacon bits.  Not great on the waist, I know, but oh so good.",
