My recipe varies only slightly from this one, but it may help those who experienced any problems. Line your jelly roll pan with foil, then spray the foil with cooking spray. (This way you won't wreck your pan, and they won't stick) Heat the sugar and butter to boiling, then boil three minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Pour mixture over crackers and bake 5 minutes. Sprinkle chocolate chips evenly over top (I use milk chocolate as a matter of personal preference), then spread evenly as the chocolate begins to melt -- no need to return this to the oven. I then top with 1 cup finely chopped almonds or pecans, pressing down lightly. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, then break into pieces and store in refrigerator.  This is no fail and just delicious...addicting too!",

About 1/4 of a 16 oz. package of crackers lines the bottom of a jelly roll pan.  To use close to 10 oz., you would have to have more than one layer of crackers.  I did not do this.  I used enough crackers for one layer on the bottom of the pan.  I also melted the chocolate chips on the stovetop with about 1 Tbsp of milk.  This made it easier to spread.  I also melted some white chocoalte chips and drizzled over the top for color.  Like someone else suggested, I boiled the sugar mixture for about 2-3 minutes before topping the crackers to bake.  This made the toffee more firm.",

The changes that I made are this - I make sure that I boil the sugar and butter for a few minutes until it starts to darken and morph into a pre-candy stage. Also I cook the whole thing for 8 -10 minutes before adding the choc chips. Then I just pop it in (even with the oven off) to melt the chips. I burnt it the forst time that I cooked it for 5 minutes. Too hot for chips at that temp.. It does take a while to set. I always put mine in the garage or porch (in the winter). IT will help speed the process. Not the real thing but close with tasty results!!!!!!!",
