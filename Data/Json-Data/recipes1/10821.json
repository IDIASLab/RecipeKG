This makes a little more filling and I like the texture better than using just cornstarch for thickening. I also use a wire whisk to stir.",

Slice 2 bananas in the bottom of your cooled crust and then add the pudding mixture after it is slightly cooled. I usually top with whipped topping and toasted sliced almonds. (If using coconut stir in 1/2 cup or amount desired into the mixture after stirring in butter and vanilla then pour into crust.) All are huge hits at our house!",
