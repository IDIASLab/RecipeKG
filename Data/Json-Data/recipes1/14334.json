I couldn't use the grill as we were having a major thunderstorm so I lightly sauteed the chicken in a frypan and then just added the sauce and let it simmer for about 15 minutes.  I used some homemade peach jam that didn't set up which was perfect.  I also couldn't grill a peach for the side but definitely will next time.  Thanks!  Everybody that ate it, loved it!",

I did cut the recipe down to two servings to use a package of Costco's boneless skinless chicken breasts, and I cut those in half horizontally.  They didn't take very long to grill, but I followed the instructions, using the leftover sauce to pour over the sticky rice (calrose) that I made.  This was really tasty stuff!  This will make our regular rotation for sure!  Thanks for the recipe!",
