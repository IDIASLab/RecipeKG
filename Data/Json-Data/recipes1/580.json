I must say I have tried several recipes on here w/the same concept of rolling dough made from cake mix in 10x sugar and these by far are the prettiest with the best effect. I used a D.H. dark chocolate fudge mix. TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THOSE WANTING TO MAKE THESE...IF U BUY AN 8OZ CONTAINER OF COOLWHIP AND REMOVE 3/4 CUP....DUMP THE REST IN THE BOWL...THAT IS EXACTLY 2 1/4 CUPS It makes it easier to use a cookie scoop and just remove them into the bowl of 10x sugar and roll around. No sticky fingers. I didn't refrigerate dough at all. Very attractive cookie. They taste soft and chewy like a brownie almost.",

I make them one batch at a time because the batter is so sticky, and I've burnt out a couple of handmixers because I tried to rush it.. I also stopped using handmixers with this.. lol!  My favorite is using Lemon Cake Mix.   Tip for fluffier cookies: Use cold Cool Whip out of the fridge, I found out that if I used warmer Cool Whip the cookies turned out flatter and not as chewy.  ",

The batter is definitely sticky and I burned up my hand mixer and had to finish mixing by hand. Very difficult. Another reviewer suggested dusting your hands with confectioners sugar to prevent the batter from sticking to them. That was invaluable advice because again the batter is very sticky. I would not go through the trouble of making these cookies again. If I want chocolate cake bites I will simply make a chocolate cake.",

This Christmas for the neighborhood cookie exchange I plan on making a selection of variations - in addition to the two listed above I will also do orange with pecans white with crushed peppermints and spice with raisins.
