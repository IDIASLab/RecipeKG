A few tips: I always add more tomato paste -- closer to 2 TBSP -- and stir it into the mixture before adding the broth.  Also, the vegetables need extra time to cook at the end. Bring them to a boil and reduce heat to medium or med-high (still bubbling) and cook until veggies are just softened.  Return to rapid boil for cornstarch addition and reduce heat to low or turn off completely. Add parsley and let sit for about 10 mins.-- the stew will reach a wonderful consistency. Serve with warm cornbread or rolls and you are set. Yummy!!!",
