Sometimes, I put in a few very thin slices of virginia baked ham from the deli as well.  They are always a hit.  I appreciate the idea to refrigerate them before slicing.  I've always found them hard to slice, but I'd never thought of that.  Thanks for the suggestion- I'll try it next time!",

I also added some shredded cheese to the mixture, plus some oregano & ground black pepper. I  made \"mini\" pinwheels, then topped with swiss cheese before baking. Had to bake an extra 5-6 minutes to get them cooked through and golden brown, but they were great! Especially good served with a creamy dressing/dip, like Ranch, dill, or Caesar. Will definitely make again!",
