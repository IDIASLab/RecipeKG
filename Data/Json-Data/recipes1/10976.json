I would increase the frosting to allow for extra to pipe onto the cake to decorate it.  A \"crumb layer\" is helpful when frosting this cake.  Frost the cake very lightly and pay no attention to all the crumbs that will fall off the cake and mingle in the frosting.  Refrigerate the cake for about a half an hour to let the icing firm up and then remove the cake and finish frosting the cake.....this way the crumbs stay in the first layer and will not ruin the look of the finished cake.",

I also used store-bought lemon curd.  I did make the included recipe for the lemon buttercream frosting, which was out of this world!  I will definitely make this cake again and again.

Some five star examples were: use a store bought white cake and jared lemon curd and then a five star rating. You are not rating this cake and doing someone counting on the reviews a true dis-service.  The frosting turned out really good but that was it for me. The cake was too dense and the filling was, I can't believe I am saying this, too lemony. I love lemon and was excited about this cake. This was a cake for a baby shower and I was disapointed and I don't think anyone ate their whole piece. I may try again as the reviews are so high but so many people changed it so dramatically that I don't know if I will.",

Left one cake in tact and cut the other in half for a three layer cake. The uncut cake on the bottom with lemon curd (purchased) spread over it. Then topped with the second layer of cake and put a whipped topping & lemon pudding mixute on it.(3 oz pkg instant lemon pudding - prepared. Let it set up for five minutes then blend about 1/2 container of whipped topping into it.) Then placed the top cake layer on and frosted everything using the lemon cream cheese frosting from this site. Plenty of frosting to add decorative piping. I had people who were completely stuffed from a large meal coming back for seconds of cake! It was fabulous!",

For the cake I added Lemon pudding filling and Lemon extract so that The cake itself would have a Lemon extract. My other change was that I used Lemon extract where ever the recipe called for vanilla extract. I also doubled the cake mix so that I was able to fill my pans a little more so that when I cut the layers in half it would be thick enough for the cut. I would suggest to double up on the icing as well. The original recipe makes just enough but if you are like me and wish to have enough icing to fully cover the cake like I wanted to then a double batch would be good. I did have a problem with the way that the filling tasted. To me I could still taste the yolk of the eggs and I didn't like that so the next time I would prefer buying a Lemon filling for that part of the cake. I will make this cake again!",

Next time I will pipe frosting around the inside edge of the layers with filling. I began with makeing the filling and letting it cool while I baked the cake. I did substitute 1/3 cup of the milk for lemon juice. I will try more next time. I love lemon and this cake totally took care of my craving. A really wonderful cake!",
