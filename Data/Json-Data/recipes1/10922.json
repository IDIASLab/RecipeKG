I start this off by heating a little olive oil in a skillet and start cooking my potatoes.  After the potatoes have a good start, I add the hot sausage, cut into cubes as well and cook that.  This gives the potatoes a WONDERFUL flavor.  I then add sliced red and green peppers and sliced onions.  I put a lid on it and let it cook so that the potatoes get soft.  YUMMY!  This is great on a buffet for a party.  I haven't made this for a while, but writing this review has made me hungry for it, and now I know what tomorrow's dinner will be!",

I cooked the sausage seperatly as others have mentioned, added garlic, onion powder and 2 TBLS chicken broth when sauting the potatoes. In addition, used 1 red/1 green bell pepper for more color and variety and sprinkled some shredded cheese overall. I would make this easy & economical meal again...esspecially on busy nights!

As far as the potatoes go, I find it easiest to cook them in the microwave first and then fry them in the pan with the onions and peppers. It's much faster that way than to cook the potatoes raw in the pan. Just stir it a lot so they don't burn. I also add a lot of pepper and Creole seasoning, then top with torn up 2% cheese slices. Everything gooes together and it's soooo good, without being 800 and some calories a serving.",

Secondly, don't change the recipe entirely then offer a bad review.  Just submit your own custom version - that's why allrecipes is good enough to offer you that choice. I'm mean really!!!
