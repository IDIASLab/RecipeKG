I also added some worcestershire sauce to the meatballs and a few dashes to the soup. I used about 3 cups of water and one Tbsp. of beef bouillon (equal to about 3 cubes I think) to make the soup. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and a half cup of rice. I waited until the very end to add the low-sodium cream of mushroom soup. Everyone in my family raved even my picky 4 year old! My two year old even ate a whole bowl and my 6 year old had three helpings! This one is a real keeper!",

I did tweak it a bit to add a little more flavor and reduce the fat even more First I used about cup minced onion and about 2 tbs. fresh minced garlic in the meatballs. Second there is no need to cook the meatballs in oil if you have a good non-stick pan. And finally I used non-fat chicken stock and non-fat cream of mushroom soup. This is excellent and I will definitely be making it again!",

I served it with homemade garlic dinner rolls and waldorf salad. It was a perfect meal for a very rainy day. Update 2008: I added an extra can of beef broth and half a box of rotini noodles and made it like a stew. Still tastes great and is a nice variation.",
