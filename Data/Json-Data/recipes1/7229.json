I used frozen Costco meatballs but used the sauce recipe.(60 meatballs per batch) Chili sauce was quite expensive, so I substituted 2/3 catsup and 1/3 chili sauce. It tasted the same.(check the ingredients, almost identical)  I made them in advance, and froze into gallon ziplock freezer bags. Then just re-heated and they were AWESOME!  I have had several phone calls since reqesting the recipe. Thanks for the recipe Tammy!",

I have requests to make it for the upcoming Super Bowl and I had to email 5 copies of the recipe to friends. I used Sam's Club frozen meatballs and browned them in a little bit of soy sauce and a can of Dole pineapple chucks w/the syrup. While they were browning I whisked together the Heinz Chili sauce Smucker's grape jelly and the lemon juice. After that came to a boil I poured it over the meatballs in the pan and let simmer for 20-30 minutes. They were ready to go after that. I would have followed the crock pot directions but I woke up too late to start it in the crock pot. I think this will be the way I cook them from now on. Hope this is helpful:-)",
