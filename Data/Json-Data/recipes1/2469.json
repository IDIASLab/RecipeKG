I typically bake a half batch of the recipe to make 24 mini-cheesecakes to limit how much we eat! (Cut baking time down to about 15-20 minutes.)  Definitely use fresh lemon juice as it and the lemon zest are key to getting the great flavor.  I do also make a more traditional graham cracker crust which is thicker than suggested for the crust in this recipe.  I recommend cutting the strawberries into pretty small pieces to make the cake easier to eat, especially on the mini-cheesecakes.  One other reviewer wrote about having the topping not set - it has to cool enough.  Here in Florida that means it ends up in the fridge.  Bake and enjoy!",

I followed the recipe exactly but the apricot topping never set up so when I took it to my sister's for Easter I got glaze everywhere!

Next time I'll bake the cheesecake as directed but top it with a little fresh fruit compote right before serving.",
