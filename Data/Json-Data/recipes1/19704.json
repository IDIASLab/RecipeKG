First, I really hate when people \u201creview\u201d a recipe after having TOTALLY changed it. That being said, I only had lemon cucumbers instead of regular ones. So I used 3 blended & 1 diced of those. No \u201cseeding\u201d necessary w/ those little ones. I also didn\u2019t have chicken stock, so I used chicken broth. After tasting it as the recipe called for, it was good...but was missing the creamy element. I happen to have a bit of our family\u2019s \u201ccreamy pesto\u201d (nearly equal portions of sour cream & a little more pesto mixed together) leftover that I had used w/ another dinner so I threw that in. Only about 1/3 cup of the creamy pesto & it took this recipe way over the top. So good. Will definitely make it again the way I did it with the lemon cucumbers & creamy pesto added. Super refreshing & light. My husband made me tell him the ingredients about 4 times because he didn\u2019t believe that it was so simple & yet so flavorful.",
