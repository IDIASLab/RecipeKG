I partially froze it to make slicing strips thin and easy.\r\n * Fresh mushrooms are a must!! Baby bellas or crimini will do.\r\n* A splash of dry sherry adds wonderful depth of flavor\r\n*Beef broth will remove the coveted brown bits from bottom of skillet.\r\n*8 oz of sour cream is sufficient\r\n*Add Paprika, freshly grated black pepper & kosher salt to season dish to perfection.\r\n My food critics, a husband and five kids loved it. Even the vegetarian high school senior loved the mushroom loaded sauce. Thank you, Sue for the beginnings of a mouth-watering dinner.",

I saute mushrooms along with the beef and onions and add 1/2 teaspoon of paprika before adding the sour cream. 16 oz of sour cream is too much however, I think 8 oz is about right. Make sure you don't overcook the beef and be very carefull after adding the sour cream, if you bring it to a boil it will curdle, just let it warm up and serve immediately.",
