I switched this up a bit by reducing the sugars to 1C br. sugar and 1/2C white sugar (as I was going to add a glaze to the finished cake), replacing 1C of the flour with whole wheat flour and adding 1/4 tsp cardamom along with the cinnamon.  And as dense as the batter was, it baked evenly and was done at 35 min (in a glass pan).  Then, to gild the lily, I poured Caramel Frosting VI on top.  Moist, apple-y... just plain delicious.

In addition to the cinnamon, I added sprinkles of nutmeg, cloves, and pumpkin pie spice.  The resultant cake was a beautful dark brown with a crackled appearance.  The cake is beautifully moist and rich, with a spicy apple-y flavor.  Great with Caramel Frosting VI from this site.",
