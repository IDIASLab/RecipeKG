I don't know why so many reviewers found this so salty; I just sprinkle each chop with the garlic salt - I don't pay any attention to the measurement called for in the recipe. The little bit of liquid left after cooking is perfect for spooning over the pork chops just before saving. Thanks for this wonderful recipe Jessie. I have probably been making this twice a month for 2 years now.",
