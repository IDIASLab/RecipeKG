I raised the oven temperature to 400 degrees, put the pan on the upper third of the oven, and baked the filets about 20 minutes. Also, I drizzled the fish with about 2 T. of  extra melted butter, letting some of it flow onto the pan. These small changes made the coating crisp and golden brown and the fish perfectly cooked. While this is not my favorite way to prepare halibut, it was an interesting change.  I won't be making this again, however, as hubby didn't like it at all (in fact, his ended up in the garbage can). He thought the topping too heavy and overpowering for this delicately flavored fish, preferring it more simply prepared. I have to agree. ",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is FANTASTIC! However I would recommend using only 1 tsp. of the Dijon mustard- not 1 tbsp. The flavor of the Dijon mustard can be overpowering potentially masking the flavor of the halibut. Also make sure you cook it at a higher temperature. Otherwise the breadcrumb-crusted fish will be a bit soggy at the bottom. However if you use high heat this will quickly evaporate all of the water that naturally comes out of the fish when baked. Other than that this recipe has a GREAT flavor. The Parmesan adds a great flavor. I served it as a fish sandwich with aioli on the side. Delicious!!!",

I didn't have horseradish so instead used Trader Joes sweet hot mustard and didn't use the required Dijon mustard.  I used 2 tablespoons.  In place of the bread crumbs I used Panko Japenese Bread Crumbs.  I also used Panko for mixing the topping.  After cooking for 15 minutes at 350, I popped it under the broiler for about two minutes to get the top golden brown.\nThis turned out great. Hubby was in heaven.
