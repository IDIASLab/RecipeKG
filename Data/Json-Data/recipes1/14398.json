My parents have fruit trees, so I needed to find a way to easily use up a lot of peaches and we've already made peach preserves, so this was it.  I've never had pickled peaches, but these are excellent.  Just the right amount of spice, but we wound up with a lot of extra liquid when putting these in the jars, which I prefer to not enough any day!  My four year old daughter had 3 peaches this morning when I was just trying them to see how they tasted.  Thanks for a great recipe, I'm sure we'll make this next time there is another bumper crop of peaches.\n\n2008 Update: Our peach tree produced a record crop this year and I made these with a friend.  We used over 100 pounds of peaches for this recipe and are excited about our stash.(and tired too! :))  For each 4 pounds of peaches you can plan on getting about 4 pints (2 quarts).  We multiplied the fruit by 5 for every batch we made (20 pounds) and only multiplied the syrup by 4 and still had plenty of liquid for canning.  Again, an excellent recipe--especially if you have a lot of peaches you need to use up.",

I'm sending it to my daughter in law.  They have a very small (personal orchard) orchard with a couple of peach trees, among the apple trees.  I hope she will give this a try.
