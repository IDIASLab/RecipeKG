I am a cheese freak, so I added extra sharp chedder cheese and some Dijon Mustard(2 Tbs). Since this was my first time making this particular dish, I have no idea if the added mustard was a plus or a minus ... \r\nAll I know is this dish was fabulous and I will certainly be making it again, perhaps next time without the Dijon, to see what the difference is like. \r\nThanks for a great dish.

Very easy to make lowfat - I omitted the cheese, and used lowfat soup and milk (stir soup & milk with a wire whisk in a separate bowl - much easier to work with when adding all ingredients together). I also add 1/8 tsp. pepper.  Note that 3 cups uncooked noodles results in 2 cups cooked noodles.  Be sure and cover the dish with foil before baking.  Tip:  if you want to fit this into a 13x9x2\" casserole dish, TRIPLE the ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I used 98% fat free cream of chicken soup and 2% sharp cheddar cheese, along with 2% milk and this tasted wonderful.  My husband had no idea he was eating low fat, you can't tell the difference!  I also used canadian bacon instead of ham and added some cayenne and garlic powder to spice it up a bit.  I also found that mixing all the ingredients in a pan on top of the stove for a few minutes helps with the cheese melting, and reduces the time in the oven to about 15 minutes.  I think the less time spent in the oven, the creamier the dish will be.  Just a thought!!  In all, an excellent meal we will have again!",
