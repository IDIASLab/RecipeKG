My husband said its \"5 out of 5 stars\" ... the way he remembers his mom used to make cobbler.  I was looking for a cobbler or crumble recipe for fresh strawberries and blueberries, but I didn't want to cook the fruit or add more sugar to the berries - just put it in the oven.  This was perfect.  I used a 9x13 glass dish and doubled the batter to cover all the berries. The topping has a springy cake-like texture and nice flavor. I always toss fruit with Minute (plain) tapioca to thicken the juices so they are not runny and found that one heaping Tbs was just right.  The strawberries and blueberries (about 3 to 1 in quantity - maybe 5 cups total) had a jam-like flavor.  Great!  Thanks Victor.",

This cobbler--actually more berry cake recipe--is delightfully simple but the crust is unfortunately bland if made exactly as stated. Personally I find adding a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg perk up the flavor of the cobbler crust and I've made it more than once with those additions and happily eaten up every last morsel. But in it's original form I feel the recipe is a bit lacking and try to rate my reviews based on the recipe as stated versus the recipe as I've tweaked it.",

I like to take it out when it is golden brown and then let it sit for 5-10 minutes so the fruit juices solidify just a bit.  No matter what though, this has always been a big hit when I make it.",
