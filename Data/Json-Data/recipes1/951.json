By making some very simple alterations, I've had some really wonderful results.  First, to combat dryness, I add the amount of 3/4 cup of milk AND 1/4 cup of sour cream. Not enough moistness for you?  I've gone as much as 1/2 cup of the sour cream and been happy with it--depends on your tastes.  I also add a teaspoon of vanilla extract into the batter, which lends a great flavor.  I love the topping of sugars, but they are also wonderful with coarse sugar sprinkled on the top.  It's a simple recipe that yields consistant results.  My daughters love these muffins and request them often.",

The sugar on top was a nice touch and my muffins came out just fine.  I'd definitely make these again.
