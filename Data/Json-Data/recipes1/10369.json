My husband and I were reintroduced to Green Goddess at a new restaurant in town that highlights 40s and 50-style restaurant food - baked ham great steaks (peppered steak with brandy sauce) wonderful meatloaf Stroganoff - the kinds of food I remember being on the menu when my folks took us to \"fancy\" restaurants but \"kicked up\" for the new century. Anyway we tried the Green Goddess and my husband was hooked - and this one is better than at the restaurant. Can't wait until summer so I can use fresh tarragon from the garden!",

I only used 1/3 a cup because the first time I made it I felt it was too bitter. I added another garlic and used 1 1/2 of the green onions. Also I only used 1 anchovy as they were extra fishy. I love anchovies and the more the better but these were just not that great.. I have to say with all that it was still amazing and delicious. I used Mayo light and you can't even tell the difference.. I live in South Africa and have a all girl get together tomorrow I can't wait for my girlfriends taste my Green Goddess YAY thank you so much.. It is also always better the next day",
