However, a few comments:  There seems to be a large proportion of marshmall ows, which skews the consistency for me.  Will use fewer marshmallows and perhaps more nuts?  Some diced apple?  Or maybe pineapple tidbits instead of crushed?  Also, maybe I'm an idiot, but I was kind of shocked by the huge amount that this recipe made.  lol.  The flavor is spot-on. :-)\r\nUPDATE:  This was SO GOOD after it sat for a day....can't stop eating it!!  Also fantastic frozen.  Changing rating from a 4 to a 5!",

I added the full amount of all ingredients except marshmallows--I probably only put a cup and it was just enough. I didn't have any problems with it being runny like some did. I didn't just drain the crushed pineapple I squeezed a lot of the juice out. Also you have to beat the whipping cream long enough for it to be very stiff. I think if yours gets runny it's because you're not beating the cream long enough. If you're using Cool Whip instead make sure to cut back on the sugar or it will be way too sweet since whipped topping is already sweetened. And to cast my vote on the Frozen verses Chilled versions-- I prefer Chilled.",
