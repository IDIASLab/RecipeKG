Definitely use more sauce than suggested - I usually use at least 2 jars.\nA hint when using no-boil noodles to keep them from being crunchy or gummy: coat the bottom of the pan with sauce BEFORE you lay the noodles in the pan.  I also mix the sausage (or beef or turkey) in with the sauce and always place the sauce on the noodle layer.  It's the sauce that gets absorbed by the noodles and cooks them (hence why you need plenty of sauce).",

I put some sauce on the bottom, 1 no-boil noodle, and continue layering, using 3 noodles per loaf pan.  Bake one, and freeze the rest.  When you want to fix on of the frozen ones, put in in the fridge the night before.  And for those who had trouble with the no-boil noodles, if you let them soak for a few minutes in hot water it will solve the problem.  Still a lot simpler and faster than boiling.  ",

First of all I don't understand why people pay that extra price for the \"no boil\" noodles. Regular lasagna noodles work just fine. I don't even place them in a bowl of hot water. Just place some sauce in the bottom of pan and lay noodles (not touching) to make room for growth. Then I added hamburger to the sausage and cottage cheese black olives and spinach to the cheese mix. I always mix the four cheeses and an egg or two with the drained spinach and black olives and cheeses. Then I mix the sauce with the hamburger and sausage. Then I only have one bowl & one pan to clean up. I too needed extra sauce. Sometimes I make my own (if I have all day as the sauce does need to simmer for at least 3 or 4 hours) I layer sauce noodles cheese mix more sauce noodles and keep on going until all is gone. then top with lots of mozzarella. Cover and bake until really bubbly and remove cover and cook some more for about 15 minutes to get the cheese cooked. I personally like the cheese a bit crunchy. GREAT recipe. Thanks for sharing!!",

I ended up using a bottle and a half of marinara sauce and extra mozzarrella. All in all very yummy and easy. Made enough for many left overs!",
