I had to boil 2 potatoes in it to try to remove it.Once I got the salt falvor reduced I found that the chili has a wonderful flavor and is very full bodied without being excessively hot.I added an extra 14.5ounce can of stewed tomatoes and I used Moose Drool Beer. I will make this again however I will ELIMINATE THE 1 TABLESPOON OF SALT. The beef bouillon adds more than enough. Too bad I didn't read the other reviews first! About 5 out of 30 people said this was way too salty. The potato idea works for those of you who forget to read the reviews first!",

This was tasty--very beefy. This was quite easy which I appreciated after the day I had. I basically sauteed the veggies and meat and threw everything in the crockpot all day just to save on time and energy. Close to my favorite chili--I think it could use a can of tomato paste but quite good. My husband remarked this would be great in chili dip.",

I put a large spoonful in a bowl to \"test\" it and ended up eating 2 1/2 bowls in nothing flat. I did use hamburger instead of beef chuck and left out the tablespoon of salt. Indeed the salt factor was perfect without additional salt. I enjoy experimenting with chili recipes and this is one of the best ever!",
