I did switch to Garam Masala (one of my favorite spice mixes from Penzey's) and I may have added a bit more cayenne-it was hard to see when I was giving a shake. I took it to a potluck, and brought home enough to take to work today, but enough was gone that I know people tried it-potlucks always have so much food! Such a nice switch from the salty Chex mix that I grew up hating.",
