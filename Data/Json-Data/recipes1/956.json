Also the cake was done in 1 hr 15 min. Adding 15 more minutes to the cake would have made it too dry I think-- just watch in your oven the first time. I frosted it with some melted chocolate chips that I thinned with a bit of evaporated milk. Next time I think I will stir the cocoa in with the flour-- it might be a bit easier to combine with the batter then stirring it in the last minute. Might try some differant extract flavors instead of the vanilla-- orange raspberry or almond would all be good.",

I've been trying to get her to teach me how to make it before the recipe is lost forever but she's one of those cooks who doesn't measure anything so it is really hard to pin down the actual measurements. Thank you so much for submitting this recipe. I tried mixing together the powdered sugar cocoa and heavy cream like someone suggested and it turned into whipped cream instead. (I guess I stirred it a little too much!) But this cake does not need anything!! Thanks again!",
