I did take one reviewers advice and put the quinoa with the kale while it was hot to help wilt the kale a bit, which I liked.  The kale isn't so chewy that way.  I also used raisins instead of currants, but followed the recipe other than that.  Fabulous!  Will make this again!",

From the reviews, I would also echo the need to shred the kale really tiny or its too chewy. I also rubbed the dressing in with my hands after I warmed it up a little to help wilt the kale. If I were to make it for myself and not for a group, I would significantly reduce the quinoa (just adds extra carbs I don't need and it makes it more of a quinoa base not a kale base. I prefer to get my protein from a meat source, not a grain), add more garlic, and skip the currants/raisins as its my preference. However, since I hate it when people rate the recipe and then list all the ways they changed it...I still give it a 5 according to its original instructions!",
