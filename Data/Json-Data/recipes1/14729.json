I added the recommended tablespoon of peanut butter and also added a tablespoon of my favorite habenero hot sauce,(Ebese Zozo) which is a curried hot sauce.\n\nNext time I'll double the curry paste and add a bit more lime juice. It also seems my jumbo prawns finished quicker than the sea scallops so I'd start the scallops about 2 minutes before I throw in the prawns next time.\n\nVery tasty if you like coconut curries, yum!",
