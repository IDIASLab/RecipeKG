The cake baked up beautifully, the cherries were perfect, and the whole thing just came together wonderfully.\n\nThe only change I made (and I heartily recommend it)is that I made a syrup out of 1/2 cup reserved cherry juice, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/4 cup Kirsch (cherry liqueur - added after the juice/sugar simmered for a bit and then cooled).  I drizzled this syrup over the cake sections before I spread the cherries and whipped cream on.  It added moisture and tied everything together.  Yum! ",

                "reviewBody": "A lovely cake!  It took me 3 hours from start to finish, though I also did a few kitchen chores between steps.  The cake part itself makes a very nice chocolate cake that I will probably use for other cakes.  Mine was not dry, in fact it was very moist in the center.  It had a somewhat crusty top that reminded me very much of brownies.  In response to a previous review,I used 2 cans of tart pie cherries (Oregon brand) that were 14.5 ozs. each.  The can said that the actual wt. of the cherries was 11.5 ozs. each, so it was close to 20 altogether, and to me it seemed the perfect amount.  It seems very involved, and I suppose it is moreso than opening up a mix and a can of frosting, but it just takes more time and the effort is worth it.  With the crumbs on the sides (and I also added a dusting of crumb to the top) it is a very forgiving cake for those who have trouble frosting neatly.  I agree with the reviewer who suggested starting the cherries first.  It took me almost the entire baking time to cook the cherries, and I cooled them in the refrigerator while the cake cooled.  But they were still a little warm when I started to put it all together.  Had my kitchen been warm today, that might have been a problem.  Thank you for a great recipe.  I will definitely be making it again.",

The cake was delicious, the cherry topping and whipped cream spectacular. My only adjustment to the recipe itself was adding an egg - a nod to the cupcakes - but I was very pleasantly surprised by this cake and found it pretty easy to make. For my purposes, I had a lot of leftover cherry topping and whipped cream - I ended up making a parfait with the cupcake tops. This cake does rise pretty well - if you're thinking about going the way of cupcakes, I would make sure to fill the cups barely 1/2 with mix.",

I used another reviewer's suggestion and brushed the layers with the sugar/cherry juice/kirsch mixture.  The cake was already pretty moist, so while that tasted good, it needs to be used sparingly on a cake mix cake.  I also stabilized the whipped cream by adding unflavored gelatin (directions below) since I was taking it to a party and I needed the whipped cream to hold up and not get droopy.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I will reduce the sugar a little and use the dark sweet cherries instead to see if I like that better!  (To stabilize 2 cups of whipping cream, dissolve 1 tsp. unflavored gelatin in 2 Tbsp. cold water and let sit 5 minutes.  Heat over simmering water just until gelatin dissolves; cool slightly.  In bowl whip cream and confectioner's sugar just to soft peaks.  Add dissolved gelatin and whip just a little more until stiffer peaks form.  This will help the whipped cream hold its shape for a day or two, and it doesn't make it rubbery.)",

I did use canned cherry filling instead of the homemade and in place of the whipped cream I used the recipe for French buttercream Frosting. Everyone loved it.",
