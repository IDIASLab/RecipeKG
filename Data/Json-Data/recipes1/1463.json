For the information of those reviewers who downrated the recipe because it was light and sweet: one doesn't EXPECT Swedish rye bread to be dense and heavy like pumpernickel or Jewish rye - it's a softer, sweeter rye, and in its own way just as delicious (some think more delicious than) as the heavier, more typical, ryes. I think the reviewers who found it too sweet and light just aren't familiar with Swedish rye bread. Each type has its place. I will be trying this one.",

I did note that one reviewer said the bread was \"too sweet\" for sandwiches--yes, but that is not the end purpose for Swedish rye.

If I think differently after I make it, I will re-rate.  I grew up on this bread and everyone in this part of the country (upper Michigan) is always looking for a good, sweet, rye bread.  Not easy to find!  Yes, it is awesome toasted and for the sandwich part??? I have found that it makes great ham sandwiches.  I always try to find sweet rye bread around Christmas because it is so good with ham.  I use a small amount of mustard and for some reason American sliced, processed cheese works very well and I usually don't like that cheese much.  It just goes good with this bread and ham. For those who can't get cake yeast, use 1 1/2 packets of dry active yeast, or about 3 1/3 tsp. of dry active yeast.  Just proof the yeast in the warm water before adding to dry ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe.",

I used active dry yeast instead (2 1/4 tsp for each fresh yeast cake). I also used white whole grain flour and substituted 1/2 cup whole grain oat flour for some of the wheat flour. I also added a tablespoon of wheat gluten because whole grains tend to produce less elasticity. I'll probably increase the amount of rye flour next time and substitute agave nectar for the brown sugar (to lower the glycemic impact). This was an excellent and easy recipe.",

I had to use dry active yeast instead of fresh yeast (3 1/2 tsp) - added the rye flour first then about 5 1/2 cups of bread flour instead of the 6 cups called for.  I used organic vegetable shortening (no transfat) but you could use lard or butter instead.  This makes 3 large loaves and is too big and heavy for the kitchen aid to do the kneading.  I made the dough and left it to rise over night.  Shaped and formed the loaves and allowed it to rise for hours and hours the next day.  It really is what Swedish Rye bread should taste like.
