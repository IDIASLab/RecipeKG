Very simple recipe easy to follow no rolled oats (which was perfect for us) not to fond of rolled oats and they tasted marvelous. The only thing different is that I soaked the raisins for 2 hours before making these cookies to make the cookie moist. OTher than that...we had a great time making them and my daughter received her cooking badge. Great cookies!From Saskatchewan",

The oatmeal flour makes a chewy cookie and is more soluable so it takes a cup to replace 1/2 cup of flour. yummy!",
