I then added all sauce ingredients added a can of cream of mushroom soup and simmer the chicken mixture for about 30 minutes. I cooked the rice separately (1 cup) and served the sauce over the rice. Delicious with these modifications! I've always found that keep the rice separate from other ingredients makes for better leftovers. Thanks!",

Decreased soy sauce in half to 1 tablespoon because my wife says soy sauce makes her retain water. We thought this meal had enough flavor with only half the soy sauce. 2. Increased the rice to 3/4 cups based on GTIDEY's tip. It worked out just right for us like this. 3. Decreased bake time to just 1 hour. Since the chicken has already been browned in the skillet I believe it would have been overcooked in the oven if baked for 1 1/2 hours. The meal was well-cooked with just 1 hour bake time.",

I took other review's advice and upped the amount of rice to 1 cup. Glad I did we didn't have much left over. The chicken also was a little dry and I reduced the cook time to 1 hour.
