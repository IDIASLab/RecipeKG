I do not buy bread from the store and this basic recipe is the one I use the most. More often than not I set my bread machine on the dough cycle, pull out the dough when finished (first rise) and form into 8 sandwich/burger rolls or (occasionally) 12 hot dog buns. They go into the oven which was heated to 200 degrees F and then turned off. I let them sit/rise  for an hour then bake at 350 degrees for about 18 mins. Perfect buns every time. When I do bake a loaf in the bread machine, it also comes out perfect! Oh yes, I also substitute 2/3 (2 cups) of the white flour for whole wheat flour. My husband loves that I literally save dollars per batch of bread, plus fresh hot bread cannot be beat!",
