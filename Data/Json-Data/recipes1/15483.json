I doubled the recipe and made only one change which was to top with a big can of French fried onion rings. I also used some cornflakes but the next time I'll skip them. The onion rings hit the spot perfectly. Next time I will use a low-fat sour cream to cut out some of the calories and I will let the potatoes cheese and sour cream reach room temperature before mixing and baking. With everything so cold it took longer to heat through to the center. Also I recommend adding the onion rings (or corn flakes) only for the last 15 minutes so they don't get too brown. I recommend mixing everything before adding to the potatoes so that it's well incorporated. This is something I will definitely make again and not just for a brunch! It was delicious!",
