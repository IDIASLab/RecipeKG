I made mine in a pyrex baking dish that was about 10\"x10\" and I felt as though 16 oz of cheese was a bit too much (I'd already grated a pound so I put it all on) I think it really depends on how big the surface area your dish of choice is. Also I would definitly suggest seeding your tomatoes before dicing them it will prevent the dip from getting wet and it will keep a lot better. This is one of those recipes I can never stop myself from eating too much of.",
