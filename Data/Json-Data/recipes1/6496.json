I only give it 4/5 stars b/c of the necessary modifications.\n\nBased on the other reviews, I only used 12oz of bowtie pasta and doubled the sauce ingredients (but only used 5-6 Tbsp of butter; I also did not double the parsley).  I used just 2 chicken breasts, and also doubled the sun dried tomato portion.  We didn't have any Romano cheese at home so I omitted it and it still turned out great! I am not sure why another reviewer said this dish lacked flavor, b/c it is full of flavor! We also like our food with a little kick, so I added about 1-2 tsp crushed red pepper (to taste).  My husband raved about it and is already anxious to eat leftovers for lunch tomorrow!",

I read through many of the reviews and made several changes, one of which was halving the pasta (I used tri-color rotini), which made the amount of sauce just perfect! I used the \"light\" cream of mushroom soup, sauteed green onions and garlic in olive oil first (instead of butter), and added a splash of dry white wine. I also used Italian seasoning instead of parsley and added some crushed red pepper. I rehydrated my sundried tomatoes by tossing them in with the pasta! Worked great. I used fresh grated Parm as well. So tasty - I want to make it again soon! Thanks for a great recipe!",
