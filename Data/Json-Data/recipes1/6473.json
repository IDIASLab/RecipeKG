I sliced the already cooked pork into slivers and added it to the soup at the end of cooking. I also added a tablespoon of chinese garlic chili sauce to give it an extra kick - but that was only a preference. Now I have a great easy recipe to put together when there is a small amount of pork leftover. Thanks submitter!",
