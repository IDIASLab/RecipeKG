For the Shrimp and Grits part: I always make my grits with a little garlic powder, salt, either half and half or heavy cream as it make a more creamy, smooth grit taste versus just water.  And I just throw everything in the rice cooker, hit the button and walk away. I prefer not to have to stand over it. \nI cooked the shrimp separately for this recent Easter brunch due to some guest being allergic to  seafood. \nFor the gravy. I followed the recipe, yellow and red peppers, garlic, onions etc, but used Andouille sausage instead of the Tasso Ham as my local grocery didn't carry Tasso. Turned out delicious. Guest were raving about it. Used it over the shrimp and grits as well as over the biscuits. Yumm! We will definitely be adding this into our gravy rotation.\n\nFor those that said the sauce didn't thicken, try adding a handful of regular or Panko breadcrumbs right before adding the cream and it will thicken right up . Thanks for the recipe!",
