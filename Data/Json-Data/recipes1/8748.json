I agree with another reviewer that I think that this would be outta this world on chicken. This really was a nice change of pace. Be sure to barbecue the meat slowly the sauce lends itself to flaring up and burning if you aren't careful. Thank you for the post!",

What I was most worried about was that this marinade would have a heavy A-1 Sauce flavoring...and I was right. It's really not a sauce that I like at all. I can't describe what it is that I don't like but I just think it's one of the worst flavorings for meat! I really don't get why it's so popular. So while I liked this steak I didn't love it. And it's probably not something I'll make again because there are so many other great flavors out there! But if you're a fan of A-1 Sauce you will probably like this.",
