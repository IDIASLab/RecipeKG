I made the dough right in the bread machine (I did need to add a bit more flour for it to come together) and then continued w/ the recipe from there. I used more garlic and a tad more butter than called for as well. As far as the seasonings I didn't measure anything just eyeballed it. These were a last minute decision and came together in a snap! Wait until you smell these baking lol! I think next time I would add a bit more salt to the dough but that's just my preference. I will be making these A LOT YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
