I did marinate the chicken for an hour in a mix of the juice from 2 limes, 2 tablespoons of fresh chopped cilantro, a tablespoon canola oil and a couple dashes of hot sauce.  When it came time to saut\u00e9 the chicken, I added the marinade to the skillet along with the chicken.  The added flavor of the cilantro and lime made this dish right on par with the fajitas we get in our local restaurants here in New Mexico. Using the prepackaged onions and bell pepper strips made this recipe so much easier. Instead of Birdseye, though, I used Trader Joe's Fire-roasted Onions & Bell Pepper Strips, as I shop there weekly and it was more convenient. The results were delicious! This is now my go-to recipe the entire family loves. Muchas gracias!",

I pre-seasoned the strips of chicken with fajita seasoning and let it sit for about 30 minutes.  I would suggest using a cast iron pan or a pan that you can good and hot.   One of the best things about fajitas is the fast sear that really develops the flavor.  I then added the frozen vegetables and sprinkled another teaspoon of fajita seasoning on the vegetables.  The frozen vegetables add just the right about of water to make a nice sauce.   This is fast and very easy and very tasty with some minor modifications.  Serve in warm tortillas with a side of Easy Spanish rice.",
