        "description": "Okay. The title might seem a bit pretentious, but would anyone really look at Cheese Ball XXXVIII? This is a delicious variation on the holiday cheese ball that has been in my family for close to 40 years. It is perfect served on crusty bread or crackers. One of the nice things about most cheese ball recipes is the versatility. If you want a spicier ball, try substituting a 1/2 cup of pepper jack for the Cheddar. Don't like bacon? Use Nova lox instead. Don't like dill? Fugedabowdit! Dill makes this recipe sing! But you can play with the herbs used in the cheese ball. Who doesn't like playing with their food? Serve with crackers or a good bread. Also goes well as a spread for crudites.",
