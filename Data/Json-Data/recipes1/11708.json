Had a lot of filling for each dumpling, so if you like more crust and less filling, scale the apples down to 4 or so, depending on size. I used Honey Crunch apples instead of Granny Smith because they are sweeter, and they held up flawlessly. Finally, a recipe that doesn't call for tinned crescent rolls!",

I did run into a couple of problems. My dough needed a little extra water and never did really form a ball in the processor. I formed the ball by hand and refrigerated it as instructed. About two hours later I mixed up the filling and removed the dough from the fridge. It was as hard as a brick and couldn't possibly be rolled out. I had to leave it on the counter for over an hour until it could be rolled out. The filling became juicier and juicier during the wait. This, ultimately, caused a little difficulty in rolling it up. Even though I greased the baking dish, the finished dumplings stuck and broke apart when removed from the dish. The flavor was very good. I served them with vanilla ice cream.",

I don't make pastries very often so I found this very difficult to roll out fill roll back up and cut without making a huge mess. As was said before as well when I took the dough out of the fridge it was hard as a rock. Had to let it sit on the counter for a long time. The end product turned out pretty well but I don't know if it was worth the time and effort. Definitely needs to be served with ice cream or whipped cream on the side. We had it with vanilla frozen yogurt and that helped a lot! Will probably make again but it does need more tweaking.",

The dough sat in the fidge for almost two days before I found time to put the dumplings together. I took the dough out to warm up and it rolled out perfectly--silky smooth with great elasticity. The Granny Smith Apples I had were huge so I only used 5 and it was way too much making me wish this recipe stated the apple quantity in cups. Still was pleased with the final product and amazed at how tender the pastry was. Will definitely make these again. They're like a rolled up version of apple pie. Yum!",
