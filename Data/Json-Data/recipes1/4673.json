Added sauteed onion and garlic to the meatballs as well as a pinch of nutmeg which I love in ground chicken. I also added sliced zucchini and 1 can of small white beans to the soup. Instead of baking the meatballs, I dropped them into the soup and let them cook in the broth. I also omitted the egg in the meatball mixture, didnt think it needed it. Loved this soup, reminded me of Italian Wedding soup. I'm always looking for ways to use ground chicken or turkey, and this is a great recipe. Thanks!",

We followed the recipe exactly which by the way doesn't mention noodles in the ingredients list so make sure you have some cooking while the soup's simmering. It also doesn't mention to remove the bay leaves before serving which being in a hurry I also forgot to do:P If you have any leftovers they reheat VERY well my husband says even better than the first time around.",

Browned them with the convection oven.  Substituted parsely and summer savory for the parsnips.  Added a few chopped jalapenos, red pepper, and some edamame.  Also added white pepper and garlic powder to the broth to get the taste to our liking. Used low-sodium chicken broth and no added salt to the meat or the broth. Added Amish garlic egg noodles directly to the broth.  A great soup to have when getting over the cold/flu...I made this in December, not summer.",
