                "reviewBody": "An authentic Hoosier Sugar Cream Pie does not have a prepared cooked  filling.  The ingredients are combined and poured into an unbaked pie shell. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Bake the filled pie at 450 for 10 minutes, then lower oven to 325 degrees and bake for 50-60minutes until you can insert a knife in the center of pie and it comes  out clean. You may have to cover crust with foil for first 35 minutes or so to prevent it from over browning. Here in Indiana we use flour, not cornstarch to thicken our cream pie. We use WHOLE milk for the milk too. If you prefer to make it more traditionally, cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and add it by teaspoon into pie shell after you pour the filling into it. Sprinkle nutmeg over top. Sorry to make so many changes but this is how we do it here in In and our pies always set up very well.I sell many many cream pies throughout the year. Yum. This recipe has a rich history here in Indiana where it began in the Amish community when they ran out of their winter apples. Also was baked in the Shaker community in Eastern Indiana.",

This recipe has been in our family since before I was born in 1960. Wicks Schmick's, this is truly the best sugar cream pie from the Hoosier state! Forget the double boiler, I use medium heat with a heavy sauce pan, and after stirring in the cornstarch and milk mixture I whisk the ingredients consistently until it just starts to boil and and gets very thick like pudding. I prebake a Pillsbury pie shell, (family and friends think it's homemade), place the filling in the cool pie shell sprinkle it with Nutmeg (cinnamon is a wonderful substitute) and bake in the oven for 5 to 8 minutes. All of these people who are having trouble with the pie setting up are just not bringing it to a high enough heat and having the patience to stand at the stove and continuously whisk the ingredients until they are thick like pudding. I live in Florida now where many people have never heard of this recipe. People beg me to make this pie!",
