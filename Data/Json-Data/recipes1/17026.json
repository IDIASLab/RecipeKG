In typical Italian style, simplicity rules the day; little more than olive oil, rosemary, and salt are needed to highlight the rich flavor of the grilled meat. With Italian food, freshness and quality are top priority, so I use nothing less than choice porterhouse, and much prefer prime!",

Hubs managed both. I've had steak prepared this way all my life but always in a skillet not on the grill. Hubs resisted since he has his tried and true seasoning for grilled steaks but he admitted he liked this. Seasoning is typically just olive oil a good grey sea salt and pepper. Rosemary lemon and sometimes garlic are options I skipped. A simple garnish of arugula and some grilled potatoes with thyme finished the steak perfectly. I loved this but then again as an Italian gal who is quite familiar with this I may just be a little biased!",

I also coated the steak with spray butter after pressing in the herbs while it sat at room temperature. I still brushed the steak with a little olive oil before grilling however I used adobo seasoning (salt and seasoning blend) since I didn't have any grey sea salt on hand. It turned out to be one of the best I have ever had. The perfect grill marks made it visually appealling as well. I will definitely be making this one again...over and over....",
