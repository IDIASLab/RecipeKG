Works really well over egg noodles - don't even have to butter them.  I would reduce the water by just a little bit for thicker gravy...the longer you let it cook, the more water is absorbed.  Recipe as is is too thin for rice.  For a change of pace, use chicken breasts instead of pork, but greatly reduce water (1/4-1/2 can) since the chicken doesn't take long to cook.",

Also, I put half the amount of water, which made the gravy the right consistency to pour over garlic mashed potatoes. To add some zing to it, I garnished the top with crispy fried onions during the last 3 minutes of baking. One last thing, I shortened the baking time to 55 minutes for 1/2 inch thick of chops. This was a great recipe and very easy, will definitely make it again. Thank you.",
