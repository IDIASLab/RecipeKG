I followed the advise to cover loosely with a foil \"tent\" and cooked the meat for 20 minutes at 450, turning it down to 350 for 1 hour before putting the heat up to 400, removing the foil and continued to cook for a further 10 - 15 minutes.  Roast was medium; I would cook about 10 minutes less at 350 to have a medium rare roast.  As also suggested I took all the marinade (cooked with the roast), added a little red wine and red currant jelly.  The roast was left to rest for 10 minutes and carved before serving with the sauce poured over.  It was absolutely delicious.  Sue from Richmond Hill",

We added 1/4 c Balsamic vinegar, 1/4 c olive oil, and substituted 1 teaspoon lemon juice in place of lemon zest. We slit the roast about an inch deep all over the top and inserted lots of slivers of fresh garlic; marinated for 2 days and sprinkled with regular salt.  We placed the lamb on a rack in a covered roasting pan, added cut up potatoes and carrots, baked at 350 for 2 hours, basting every 20 - 30 minutes. We didn't need to place marinade in the middle as others suggested, and also didn't need to add water to the bottom of the pan.  We will add at least one cup of water to make gravy in the future. Moist, flavorful dish! The ingredients were a perfect blend.",

I did put an aluminum foil tent on the leg of lamb during the first twenty minutes so it would not char..I then roasted it at 350 for 1 and 1/2 hours or until my instant read thermometer read 130 (or medium rare). I added two cups of water to the roasting pan. I read the reviews on this recipe and they were right on. I marinated it for two days, the taste was fantastic. My father in law, who loves lamb, said this was the best lamb he ever had! Another point, worth mentioning, is that I purchased an \"American Lamb\" versus a \"New Zealand Lamb\". I read up on lamb in the \"Joy Of Cooking\" and they stated an American lamb is more tender and sweet then other lambs. I had twelve people for dinner this Easter and they all loved it! Thanks!",

I think this made it much easier to handle.  A couple of problems I had.  I watched the time very closely but the top of the roast did burn.  I beleive that this roast is cooked at too high of a temperature.  Normal roasting time is lower temp (325) for 2 1/2 hours.  I think that is what I will do next time as my roast would not cook through and I finally ended up lowering the temperature (because the top was burning) and I let it cook another hour.  Other than that, I thought the marinade was pretty good.",

I made it for Easter dinner and it was perfectly caramelized on the outside, and pink and juicy and tender on the inside, with such a wonderful flavor from the marinade. I used a boneless, tied roast (about 5 lbs.), the lemon juice from the lemon I zested, a splash or two of soy sauce, and a dash of balsamic vinegar. Marinated over night, roasted 20 minutes at 425, then turned down to 350 for remainder of the time. Poured 2 cups of water to the pan, and basted with the leftover marinade a couple of times while cooking. Used a foil \"tent\" when I noticed it getting too brown. I also used a meat thermometer to check for doneness. Will make this again!!",
