I, too, thought the recipe called for too much cinnamon and that the apples would end up being very raw with so little time in the microwave. I diced the apples in very small pieces and decided to use the amount of cinnamon the recipe called for. I didn't have any Rice Chex, so I used Ezekiel 4:9 Almond Cereal instead. The 45 seconds in the microwave was perfect for me! The apples came out slightly softened, the cinnamon was the perfect amount, and the cereal was still slightly crispy. I topped it off with diced strawberries and a small dollop of fat free whipped topping. I loved the textures that were going on in my mouth! This is a delicious HEALTHY breakfast, snack, or dessert! Thank you, Tawnya.",

This seems to be an extremely versatile recipe and I thought it would be pretty hard to screw up.\n\nI am mom with a family of 4 (including myself) and this is what I had to take into consideration. 1. I'm trying not to eat a lot of unnecessary carbs. 2. my daughter hates cinnamon. 3. I was awake, hungry and everyone else was sleeping and 4. I didnt want to be in the kitchen all morning making it fresh every time someone woke up.\n\nWe had 4 yellow delicious apples, so that's what I used. I cut them up in my food processor after I cored them to save time. I put them in a frying pan with the coconut oil. after the oil melted, I took out a portion for my daughter and added cinnamon to the pan. After I mixed it, I took a portion out for myself. I added the crushed cereal to my daughters bowl and the apples still in the pan. I then dished out the two remaining servings. \n\nAt this point I finished prepping my own bowl and left the families in the fridge so they could microwave theirs, add strawberries and walnuts on their own when they woke up.\n\nI added two tablespoons of hemp hearts and 1 tablespoon of flax seed to mine. \n\nIt was tasty, but next time I probably wouldn't even cook or heat the apples. I'll melt the oil and add them to the apples. I'll use pecans instead of walnuts as well.\n\nalso, our family loves coconut oil and we use it often. I didnt feel the recipe called for much, but maybe it's an acquired taste",
