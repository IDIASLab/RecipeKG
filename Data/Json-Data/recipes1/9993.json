They spread out a lot for me, and I could have used more mint.  The 2nd... perfect.  I melted the butter before adding the sugar and used bread flour.  I added a 1/2 cup of crushed candy canes (5 canes).  I also didn't grease the baking sheets.  As several others recommended I only baked for 9 minutes.  The final result is absolutely delicious!  And more festive with the candy cane pieces.",
