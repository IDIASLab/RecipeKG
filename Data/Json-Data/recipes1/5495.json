The salad is pretty bland and that's after I added the salt and pepper and tossed in some Old Bay for good measure. While I like the crunch I'm not convinced I like squash uncooked this way. It was however a nice idea and I'm glad I tried it. I'd just need to do some reworking in order to make this again. thanks for the recipe!",

I ended up adding about 2 teaspoons of basil paste, and that really upped the flavor. I think doing thin slices of the squash may help too instead of the diced pieces. It's worth trying if you have a lot of summer squash; just play around with the recipe to fit your tastes.",
