But since I am not a baker and the thought of making the top crust look nice was terrifying, I made a crumble topping: 1/2 cup each butter and brown sugar mixed together with 1 cup flour. Pour the crumbles over the pears and bake at 350 for about an hour. I took it to a party tonight and everyone raved, even hubby who claims to not like pears. Thanks!!",

The reason your pear pies are tasting like apple pies is the CINNAMON!!! Do what our family does and use NUTMEG! Other reviewers are correct: make sure your pears are ripe almost to the point of being soft. Also, don't be afraid of using salt in your dessert recipes!  This recipe says use 1/4 teaspoon salt. That's not enough to even bother with! I would at least double that, and the reason is: SALT MAKES SUGAR TASTE EVEN SWEETER! We also traditionally sprinkle some white sugar over the top crust before baking. This always helps us differentiate it from an apple pie at a family meal.",

Originally came upon recipe because we have a pear tree that gave us an over abundance, more than we could give away or store.  The first time I made the recipe I followed exactly as written, until I came to the lemon zest and realized I didn't have a whole lemon.  I did have fresh ginger and grated some of that in.  My pie was wonderful!  Since then I've made a few variations of this original recipe and my winning one is, I use the lemon zest AND fresh grated ginger - at least a good heaping tablespoon.  And I have changed the 3 tablespoons of flour to 4 tablespoons of corn starch, and changed the 1/2 cup of white sugar to 1/4 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup brown sugar!.  Wonderful - the ginger gives it a taste that is not over powering where anyone can put their finger on what it is - but it makes it most unique.  The corn starch allows the cutting of the pie to come out picture perfect",
