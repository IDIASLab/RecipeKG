I prepared the recipe pretty much as written and, although I couldn't measure 1/4 ounce of chopped mint I used about 1/8 cup chopped, fresh mint.  I used 2 cans of drained, white cannelini beans and I used the whole can of artichoke hearts.  It was thoroughly enjoyed by all. It tasted fresh and refreshing.  Next time I may add slivered Kalamata olives instead of ripe olives, hmm...and maybe some crumbled feta on top, too.  A family member suggested I toss in some diced cucumber, too. Nice recipe, Sara.",

I used two cans of artichokes and a can of olives and I used green onion instead of red because I prefer the milder flavor. The market was out of mint so I used a touch of fresh rosemary which has a minty undertone and extra (fresh) basil. I served this over spring mix and even with the extra veggies it didn't need more dressing. Thanks for a new and interesting way to eat white beans!",

I found a can of cannellini beans was 1-1/2 cups which worked out perfectly to cut the recipe in half. I used the ingredients and measurements merely as a guide tailoring both to suit me. For instance I used red bell pepper rather than green knowing it would add some color. Fresh mint while I have plenty of it did not appeal to me at all here so in its place I substituted arugula. I used the olive oil and vinegar sparingly in my preferred ratio of 3:1 oil to vinegar. I don't necessarily believe that garlic needs to be added to everything to make it taste better but I do believe in this instance it might have been a good addition. I also used fresh basil rather than dried. Still it was nothing special even though it looked pretty. With so many lovely and (for the most part) compatible ingredients I expected this to be much more than just average.",
