I am so glad I went with this recipe of the many banana cake recipes on this site.  The reason I did was that I did not want to buy a whole container of buttermilk that the other more highly rated recipe had.  This banana cake called for sour cream and cake flour and I had both at home.  I do find that cakes that call for cake flour are more tender and moist and this one holds true.  Like other reviewers suggested...I used 3 bananas which measured 1\u00bd cups of mashed banana.  I followed the recipe exactly. This is the most delicious cake I have made in a long, long time.  My six year old son asked if he can have this cake for his birthday cake next year.",

Instead of using 1 cups of banana I used 5 bananas and the cake turned out with that 'banana-y omph' I didnt have cake flour so i used bread flour and take away about 3.5 tablespoon away. Also i used brown sugar cos we didnt have much white sugar left Overall this recipe is great! Moist and full of flavour. I suggest u use more than 1 cup of bananas though.. I love mine!!",

I have gathered quite a few banana cake recipes over the years but this one is head and shoulders above the rest! Used 3 medium bananas. Substituted cake flour for all-purpose 1:1. Didn't have butter on hand so used 8Tbls of corn oil. Added 1 cup( 100g) of chopped walnuts everything else is exactly as listed in the recipe. Don't reduce sugar it's really at it's best with 1 1/4 cups! Baked in the 8.5 x 4.5inch pound cake rectangle at 340F for 1hour. Results are above all expectations!",
