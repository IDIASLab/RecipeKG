I fill the cups in a muffin tin with the leftovers and freeze. When frozen just pop them out and store in a Ziploc bag in the freezer.

The best thing is it's made with ingredients I always have in the house and it's not a hundred ingredients either so it's fast to make.

I quadruple it, etc.  It's great in the crockpot too; I make it in the morning when I have a minute and it sits in the crockpot on low all day.

People complain about the reviews being overrated because this isn't all jazzed-up into something special. Well what do you expect, it's only sloppy joes! I haven't had sloppy joes in years, and I am so glad I chose this recipe to finally have a taste of some. The only thing I would definitely change is the simmer time. Even on the lowest fire I had to cut it down to 20 min. instead of the original 30 because it started sticking to the pan. But it was finished by then any way and the flavors have already come out from the seasonings. This was AWESOME! A definite keeper. If you would like to simmer for the full 30 min, follow the advice of others and add just a bit of water and/or extra ketchup. This also adds more sloppiness. Yum!",

However, for those who tend to find this too sweet, don't add the brown sugar until the last, at the same time you adjust the S&P. If you find it doesn't need the sugar, skip it; or add just a tiny bit at a time until you like it.  Or try 1/2-1 tsp. molasses instead of the br. sugar to add depth of flavor without much sweetness.  \n\nStill too sweet? You might also need to substitute tomato sauce for the ketchup (in which case you might want to add a bit of additional spices.) \n\nIf you have already made the recipe as listed, and find it too sweet, DON'T THROW IT OUT!  Remember that acids are sour and will offset the sweetness. Therefore, add a splash of vinegar or unsweetened tomato products (such as tomato paste or chopped tomatoes) a little at a time until the sweetness is corrected to your tastes. Then follow the steps above next time you make this.\n\nDon't pass up this quick, easy, tasty recipe without tweaking it to suit your family's tastes! :)",
