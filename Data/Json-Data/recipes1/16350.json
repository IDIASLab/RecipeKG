It was browned in places and I had to use red onion because I am out of shallots. I cooked them both together and used about 2-3 tbsp of the chopped onion. I added 1/4 c of parm to the mix. I salted the squash with No Salt it works as good as salt and better for me before adding the mixture on top of the squash. Topped it with a little more parm. I placed the squash and pumpkin mixture back into the shell of the spaghetti squash and baked it a little more until the cheese was melted. After it came out I grated a lil bit of nutmeg on top. Black pepper would be good too. But this is so good! Nutty and the rigth kind of creamy. Thank you. The rest of you gotta try it.",
