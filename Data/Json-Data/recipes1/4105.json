It was like drinking a bottle of wine with garlic in it.  I was expecting a creamy swiss flavored soup with just a hint of wine and garlic.  The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because I didn't serve it right away, I waited about 5-7 minutes, and the cheese seperated.  Too tempermental for me.  I would suggest putting the hot broth in individual bowls, at the table, and then putting in the cheese.  I will not make this again.",

I also added 1 medium onion finely diced and sweated in the butter to make a roux with the flour. The milk I think makes it smoother when you melt the cheese in. The onion helps round out the flavor. PS- when adding the grated cheese leave the stove on LOW and slowly add the cheese stirring every once in a while. That will keep the cheese from clumping not melting and separating.",
