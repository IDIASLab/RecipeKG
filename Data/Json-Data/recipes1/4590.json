I used 1 1/3 pounds of mild italian sausage instead of pepperoni added a few sprinkles of oregano leaves increased the broth to 2 cans and added 1 cup of water. The melted cheese was a nice touch too. The only bad thing was that I forgot to let it cool down! It was interesting and unqiue but this will not be a part of my regular rotation. Good recipe Lise",
