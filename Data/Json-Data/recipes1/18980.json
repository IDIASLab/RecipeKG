I also vary the cheeses, sometimes mixing whatever shredded cheeses I have and it always works out well. No one in my family likes the green bean casserole, so this is a great alternative to that.

I also add frozen corn thawed.  I love cheese so I mix 1 1/2 cups of sharp cheddar into the casserole while it is baking and then top with the last 1/2 cup and remaining onions. Very good. If you want to make a whole meal out of this, you can add a can of mushrooms to the mixture, 1/4 cup of milk and then add 4 chicken breasts that you have cooked partially in the skillet and then place in a bottom of a 9X13 pan and cover with the vegetable casserole. The chicken stays moist and it is a nice combination of flavors.",
