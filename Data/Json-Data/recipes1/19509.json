This was such a simple recipe--I mean it's not much more complicated than peanut butter and jelly. So of course I had to complicate it a bit. I made my own crust and couldn't resist throwing a can of cherries on top--still a really simple recipe. Honestly I could have eaten the whole thing. It was dangerously yummy. I have read a few recipes on this site that have a similar ingredient profile one that would call the inside of this cheese cake--\"dip\" and I can see why. It's very light and fluffy--and a bit messy to cut through and serve on a plate. I think that this is a great base recipe that you could tweak to your liking and turn into a 5. It would be great to keep these ingredients on hand for company--it really is so simple and yummy.",
