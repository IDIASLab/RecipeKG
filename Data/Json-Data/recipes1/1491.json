I made a couple of unintentional changes - I put a whole cup of butter in the cake and I put a whole cup of butter in the frosting (apparently I momentarily forgot that ONE stick is half a cup!)  I also increased the peanutbutter in the frosting to 1.5 cups and added 1 tsp. of vanilla to the frosting.  I topped with chopped Reese's PB Cups and chopped peanuts and drizzled hot fudge around the edge.\n\nThe frosting was perfect - not too sweet and very peanutbuttery.  The cake was moist and very tasty.  I used a butter recipe yellow cake mix.\n\nI highly recommend this recipe!  I almost passed it by because the photo displayed shows a chocolate ganache frosting and my husband doesn't care for chocolate that much.  I'm glad it is actually a peanutbutter frosting.  Hubby is a peanutbutter FANATIC and this recipe is a keeper!  (I submitted a picture, too.)",

                "reviewBody": "This was very disappointing. While the peanut butter flavor in the cake is spot on, unfortunately so is the flavor that announces, \"boxed cake mix.\" In addition, this is a heavy, greasy cake, not surprising since the recipe calls for twice the fat as normally called for in a boxed mix or traditional 2-layer cake.  I didn't care for the frosting--again, heavy and greasy--about 1/2 c. too much fat, whether it's the peanut butter or the butter. It also requires quite a bit more than than the 1/3 c. cream called for to get it to even resemble a frosting rather than a fudge consistency. I decorated the cake beautifully with chopped peanuts along the side and a drizzle of melted chocolate over the top but even as I was doing that I knew it was a waste of time.  I should have trusted my gut. All told, between the cake itself and the frosting, there is a total of 3/4 cup more fat (butter or peanut butter) than should be in a cake this size that resulted in a heavy, greasy glob (particularly the frosting). I'm not even done cleaning up and the cake is already gone--with the egg shells, butter wrapper and cake mix box.",

He loved it I love it I've made it for several picnics and there is never any left over. I am not gaurding the recipe however! Try this you'll be happy.

I was making the frosting look over at my cooling cakes and there is my four year old chowing down on it...about 1/4 of my bottom layer was gone...so you know he loved it. Then I serve it up for my dad and cousin's birthdays and it was seriously a feeding frenzy. My two teenage brothers were actually fighting over who got to have seconds. My husband said it is the best cake he's ever had. I love it because it's a very versatile cake you can play around with it a lot. I made the cake exactly as the recipe tells because it was my first time making it (other than the frosting...I ended up adding a lot more cream to get the right consistancy) but next time I may play around with it a bit and maybe put a strawberry jelly layer in the middle and have a peanut butter and jelly cake or put chocolate in the middle. There's a lot you can do with it. This is undoubtedly a keeper.",
