Wonderfully quick and easy and great when one wants a single serving of a sweet treat. My mother served this to me a few times as a child. I know she got the recipe from her mother. Both have passed away and I post this recipe in honor of those hard working women.",

Not sure what you achieve by even toasting the bread?  This may be something that the kids will like, but it had no appeal to two adults for breakfast this morning.  BTW I did use cinnamon sugar.  I\u2019m the first reviewer, and I don\u2019t want to discourage others from trying.  It simply didn\u2019t work for us, but thanks for sharing.",
