The combination of fennel, beets and apples along with the honey dijon is really, really good.  Unfortunately, because beets and fennel are both very dense, the cooking time is way underestimated.  Mine needed 15 minutes in the microwave after 45 minutes in a 450 degree oven.  The last 15 minutes in the oven would never have cut it.  I recommend either microwaving for 10-15 minutes, then roasting at 450 (not 400) for one hour, and/or slicing the beets and fennel rather thinly (don't quarter the beets) and leave the apples in quarters.  Also, I would add an extra dollop of honey dijon dressing or mustard; after the long cooking time the vinegar in the dressing, plus the added vinegar, become the dominant taste.  Finally, for ease of preparation, I placed the cut vegetables/fruit in a large ziploc bag, then coated them with the dressing and other ingredients, then turned them out into the roasting pan.",

I still have to get the roasting technique down I tried cutting the beets and fennel very small but still ended up with slightly underdone beets and applesauce. I might try adding the beets first next time then the fennel and finally the apples to get them all done at the same time. Would have been a good idea to save some of the dressing for the end will do it next time.",
