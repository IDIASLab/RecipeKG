There is something magical about the pine nut and Parmesan combination, a fact that will not be lost on pesto lovers.

This inarguably has a definite Italian flair to it with its olive oil fresh oregano Parmigiano-Reggiano radicchio and arugula - which could be part of the reason I enjoyed it so much. Impressive elegant salad with a sophisticated ingredients list all carefully coordinated to work their collective magic. The dressing is outstanding using my preferred ratio of 3:1 olive oil to vinegar. To see that it steered away from the heavy and sweet (in my opinion) balsamic vinegar was welcome. I did cut back on the Dijon to 1 teaspoon and on the fresh oregano as well - no criticism of this fabulous recipe just a matter of personal taste. I added some fresh garlic I had mashed into a paste with a little salt and the back of my chef's knife. Belgian endive arugula and radicchio are rather pricey - and particularly attractive too. I thought it would be a shame to chop them up. Rather I made this a composed salad trying as well as my limited talent in that regard would allow to arrange it into a pretty presentation on the salad plate. The pine nuts took just a couple of minutes to toast in the microwave. As for the Parmigiano-Reggiano I preferred to make big shavings of it rather than grate it. This truly was a memorable salad one that rivals some I've had in some of the finest restaurants in the country.",

It tastes pretty mustardy at first so I'd suggest letting it sit for about 15 min. or so to let the dressing mellow. The cheese and pine nuts make this salad. Next time I'll increase the oregano and add some fresh basil. This was even good the next day--it didn't get soggy and the cheese had a stronger flavor.",
