In the end, my husband loved it while my teens liked it.  \r\nHere is what I done.\r\n(1) I used only 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth (Use less if you want firmer or bake at 350 for 20 minutes if it's to soupy.)\r\n(2) I omitted the yogurt & added 1/2 cup sour cream.  Big difference in taste.\r\n(3) I added another can of cream corn to mix.\r\n(4) I used garlic powder instead of cloves.\r\n(5) I used margarine instead of butter.\r\n(6) I added 4 tbsp of sugar for a sweeter taste.\r\n(7) I scooped everything into a micro safe dish and nuked on high for 5 minutes for extra firmness. Much quicker then oven. (Make sure to use a big enough bowl or it will spew over.)\r\n\r\nWith this revised...I can give this recipe 5 stars!  Takes about 30 minutes to prepare alone.",

I also put the stuffing back into the pan and bake in the over for about 20 min. to brown the top. I agree with others that this is sweeter then I would of liked but have grown to like it that way. I add a bit more spices to help c/a the sweetness. I add fresh chives as well which adds some nice flavor. Makes it a bit savory. Very good recipe. I think all will enjoy.
