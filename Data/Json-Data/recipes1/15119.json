I thought I'd have a winner here with this recipe, but I've learned that just because you love a variety of flavors doesn't mean they all belong together.  For me, this was just perfect and excellent until the addition of the cumin, which just didn't seem to work well with the spinach.  I found the cumin and spinach an \"off\" combination.  I used fresh baby spinach so I didn't have any problem with the dryness other reviewers noted, but I can easily see where this would be an issue with frozen spinach.  Oh, I know I'll make this again, because dishes like this are so familiar and just the way I grew up learning to eat and to cook - but I'll reserve the cumin for another time, in a different dish.",

This recipe is fine BUT it is missing a very important ingredient, Sweet Spanish Paprika, just use regular if thats what you have, also white wine, some add coriander and some recipes use bread in it but honestly it is already so hearty that I feel it works best without the bread. Cumin goes perfectly with this dish contrary to the other review and please please don't destroy this wonderful dish by adding cheese!!!",

After saut\u00e9ing the garlic and onion, I add the beans and mash most of them with a fork (this tastes better if most of the beans are mashed). Then I add chopped fresh spinach in batches, covering with a lid after each addition until wilted. Once all the spinach has been added, I season with cumin, salt (1/4 tsp is plenty), and a little red pepper. I cook the mixture covered for about 5 more minutes, stirring every minute or so.
