I baked it in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes (taking the foil off the last 5 - 10 minutes to let the cheese brown a bit). I used red potatoes and left the skin on. I used cheddar cheese and layered a bit throughout the potatoes. I also used soy Bacon Bacon from Tastefully Simple instead of those imitation bacon bits. Lastly I skipped the margarine and I mixed a little skim milk and a can of cream of mushroom soup and poured it over the layers before adding the cheese and bacon bits. I felt this would make it a bit creamier and kind of gel everything together. I'm going to try the original grill version in the spring when we get the grill out again.",
