I used pineapple tidbits & just tossed them in with a bit of the juice did not mash or anything. The mangos were very ripe & sweet. Orange juice instead of apple juice. Baked up nice I let it cool overnight & it was completely set (a little hard to cut actually). Might use less sugar or skip the brown sugar in future - tons of caramel sticky guck bubbled over onto the tray.",

I made the pie crust from scratch though. Makes a huge difference. Pie crust is rather easy to make so do it:)",

We used the whole quantity of sugar and it was just right. The second time I bought the presliced pineapple n the clamshell package from Costco. It was pretty sweet so I left out 1/4 cup of sugar. I could ve left out 1/2 cup or maybe more. I can t imagine canned pineapple would need the whole cup and a quarter. Other than that this is a good recipe. I use one of the hot water pie crust recipes from this site and the pie turned out great. Will make again.",
