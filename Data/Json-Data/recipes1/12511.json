It took minimal effort and the awards were to die for (well almost)\n\nI have a cuisanart 2 qt. ice cream maker and did as a user suggested to minimize the recipe to 11 servings.  This did perfect, in fact I might have even been able to do 12 but no more.\n\nI followed the directions to the tee for the exception of adding one fresh vanilla bean (split and scraped) and added freshly ground nutmeg (about 1/2 tsp I would say).\n\nMy peaches were very ripe being they are taken from our tree in the backyard.  But to make a more intense flavor I peel the peaches on top of my food processor bowl to catch the juices and simply sliced in half and took the pit out.  I then pulsed my peaches so that it was slightly pureed with some chuncks in it.  I added this mixture to the egg and sugar mixture I whipped in my Kitchen Aid.  I added the rest of the ingredients and blended on low until well incorporated.\n\nAfter that, I poured into my ice cream maker and set the timer for 25 minutes.  I then scooped it out into a freezer safe container to freeze to the consistency of ice cream.\n\nThank you so much for sharing.  A definite keeper to hand down to my children and their grandchildren.",

I gave it the benefit of the doubt however assuming the peaches must require that extra sugar. But I still reduced it somewhat anyway. Rather than peaches I used mango kiwi (fruits I had on hand) and a smidge of coconut extract and was really looking forward to this! I mixed it up added the cream and half-and-half gave it a taste and was SO disappointed to find it still too sweet for my taste. I had no choice but to add more cream which I knew wasn't going to hurt the ice cream but would indeed affect (weaken) the flavor. Thank goodness I tasted this before I churned it so that I could try to fix it! While this ended up being rich creamy and delicious since I had to dilute the mix with extra cream it was hardly \"peachy.\"",
