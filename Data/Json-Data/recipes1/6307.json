It even looks attractive on the plate.\n\nI do think the recipe is improved by taking a moment to add a little seasoning. Here are the details of what I did:\n\nInstead of using a greased cookie sheet, I used parchment paper. \n\nBefore cooking, using a paint brush, I brushed each side of the eggplant slices with olive oil to coat the entire surface and then seasoned well with salt and black pepper on both sides. Then I sprinkled on some dried basil (had no fresh basil on hand). Topped this with the tomato slice and then topped that with FRESH grated parmesan cheese. 400 degrees for about 20 minutes did the trick; timing was not too critical.",
