I took this to a meeting at church and it got rave reviews from several of the men. Some even had seconds! I would say that I could never get the jello/cherry mixture to become the consistency of \"egg whites\" and was running out of time so just decided to pour the liquid over the cake anyway. It did finally set up as intended after I added the pudding mixture. This was also a beautiful dessert. Got many oooh's and aaah's before it was consumed. I used sugar-free jello fat-free pudding and skim milk and no one was the wiser.",

I also put all of the cherry filling in the jello as opposed to keeping 1/3 out. Mainly because the canned cherries I use are not really pretty. I top with a marashino cherry or two instead. Next time I am going to try pound cake instead of angel food. But I think it is good this way also. I put it in a trifle dish and it looks like you spent a long time on it.
