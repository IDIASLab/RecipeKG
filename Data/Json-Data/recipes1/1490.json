AMAZING on chocolate cake (or cupcakes, as I made).  The recipe I used was as follows:  1 cup creamy NON-GENERIC peanut butter (the peanut butter taste will only be as good as the type of peanut butter you use-- I used Jiff and it was awesome), 1 stick BUTTER (not margarine), 2 cups confectioners sugar (NOT 4!) and 2-3 Tbsp cream OR milk.  I creamed the first two ingredients together, added the sugar and then added the cream at the end and just whipped away in my electric mixer.  For those of you who hated this recipe and said it was too greasy and not spreadable, you probably either used crappy peanut butter or used margarine which is more oily than butter OR you didn't mix the butter (at room temp) and peanut butter (also at room temp) enough before adding the sugar... use the recipe I just wrote above, and you simply can't go wrong... it was absolutely TO DIE FOR on my chocolate cupcakes and everyone at work LOVED them!  Thanks for the recipe!",

Here's what I came up with: 1 and 1/4 cup peanut butter (room temp) 1 stick butter (at room temp) 1 and 1/3 cup confectioners sugar (added slowly and mixing after each time) 4 Tbs cream. What I did was after creaming together the PB and butter and slowly added the sugar 1/3 cup at a time with 1 Tbs cream. after I mixed it I tasted it and repeated. It tasted best to me at 1 and 1 1/3 cup sugar. I added more PB (the extra 1/4 cup) about half way through to make it more peanut buttery. It's VERY rich. I used it as the filling for a chocolate cake then frosted with chocolate and sprinkled the new PB and chocolate swirled chips. It was a big hit.",

IF you use 2 cups confectioner's sugar and 1 1/2 cups peanut butter you'll get a very peanut butter flavored icing; 2 cups sugar with 1 cup pb would make a milder one though I like my peanut butter!

I was not impressed with this recipe at all. I needed to add MUCH more milk (I had no cream in the house) than the recipe called for. After the first cup I added 1/3 cup as stated but after every half cup I needed to add a healthy splash of milk to make the frosting spreadable. I used two and a half cups and found that it did make enough to frost my two layer cake with some left over however I didn't like the taste at all. Too much butter not enough peanut butter perhaps milk should not be substituted for the cream? I'm not sure but like I said the search will continue.",
