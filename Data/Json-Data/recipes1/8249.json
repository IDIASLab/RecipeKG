The first time I pretty much stuck to the recipe and my husband thought the dish was too sweet and cinnamon tasting although I thought it was fine. The second time I made it for our Christmas Eve dinner and used 50% more potatoes but kept the rest of the ingrediant amounts the same. It was also good that way - the topping adds plenty of sweetness to the dish. I noticed some reviewers thought the dish was too mushy but I found it to be the same consistency as other sweet potato dishes I have had before. I made this dish the night before (without the topping) and stored it in the refrigerator overnight. That way I just had to mix up the topping and put it in the oven on the day of our dinner.",

I have made this as directed (very rich and sweet much like a pie) used cream and oj but no condensed milk (very nice lighter orangey flavor) using rinsed canned yams and no sugar (works fine)... My only note of caution would be that on the topping do not add the flour to the butter add the sugar and nuts to the butter then the flour this avoids making a paste.",

I do believe it takes longer than 15 minutes to prep however. I know it takes a while to cook the sweet potatoes. I use fresh ones which take at least half an hour in the microwave or longer in the oven. But once the whole thing is done.... Mmmmm!!! The other thing to remember is to add the liquids slowly when blending so that the whole thing becomes creamy otherwise it'll be very thick. I tend to add a little more o.j. and/or evaporated milk if that happens. On the whole however this is a great recipe- one I'll be making this year!!",
