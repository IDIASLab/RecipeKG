I browned the pork chops with worc. sause garlic powder and seasoning salt but next time will omit the worc. sause because I found the taste wasn't fitting to the final result. I cooked the potatoes and onions in the same pan after with onion soup mix for flavour. Doubled up on cheese and put half into the mixture along with mushroom soup in place of celery. Put a thin layer of the potatoe mixture on bottom then put the chops (this kept them moist) then the rest of the potatoes. In oven for about 50 but 60 would be better. Put remaining cheese on top with about 20 minutes left and kept the lid off. Was really good and full of flavour tho next time will cut back on the sauce just as a personal preference.",

First, I used O'Brian potatoes because I wanted the onion and pepper already in there.  I browned my pork chops in worchestershire sauce and seasoned them with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  Then I browned the potatoes a bit too before I put them in the dish.  I used cream of mushroom soup and mixed in half the cheese with the soup and sour cream.  I layered the potatoes, chops, potatoes and baked for about 40 minutes.  I sprinkled cheese over the top during the last 10 minutes of baking.  It was quite good, although I'm not sure how much it actually resembles the original recipe!",
