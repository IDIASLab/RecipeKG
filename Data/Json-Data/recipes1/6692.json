Instead of placing the dough in a pan I form the dough into a round loaf shape (free-shape) and place on a baking stone sprinkled lightly with cornmeal. I let the dough rise and sprinkle some cheddar cheese on the top of the loaf before placing in the oven. After baking (it usually doesn't take more than 20 minutes) I run a stick of butter over the hot loaf to lightly coat the crust and then let cool on the stone. A very artisan looking loaf of bread...yummy!",

I used sharp cheddar and I can taste it but it's not overwhelming. All in all I like this.",

I confess that I can't leave anything alone so I altered a few things: used a bit more cheese and used extra sharp; seeded and chopped up a couple of jalapino peppers and added them; added 1/2 teaspoon each of garlic powder sesame oil and chili powder and one tablespoon of gluten. I'm about to make this again (my first try was scaled up to 16 servings so I could make two 1-pound loaves; I'm going to try 24 servings and make three loaves this time.) My only complaints for the first time were that it wasn't 'cheesy' enough (I'll use three cups X-sharp this time) and that it didn't have enough peppers (I'll fix that too; probably use about four large ones and if I'm feeling really crazy maybe 1/4 teaspoon of Dave's Insanity Sauce). I think I'll also jack up the garlic to 1.5 teaspoons the chili powder to 2 teaspoons and the sesame oil to 2 teaspoons. Oh and maybe a little more salt and sugar. The main thing... this is a wonderful recipe to play with! It took to the peppers like you won't believe! I'm thinking of tricking it out with a few more things (using half buttermilk / half sour cream etc) but for now I won't move too far from the basic recipe. Anyway if you love playing with baking breads you'll have a ball with this one!",

                "reviewBody": "I've made buttermilk bread machine breads before with great results but oddly this one was a disappointment. I made the bread from start to finish in the bread machine which I've also done before. I did two things differently this time however. The first was to add the cheese at the \"beep\" rather than right from the start with the other ingredients. Second I used fresh buttermilk rather than buttermilk powder. The cheese didn't mix in thoroughly so consequently I ended up with an unattractive mishapen loaf that was baked more in some parts than others. Also the bread was wimpy short and dense and just didn't have the lift and rise it should have. (My yeast by the way was fresh and active!) I wish I could pinpoint the problem but even after comparing this recipe to other similar recipes nothing is staring me in the face though I have noticed many buttermilk bread recipes also call for a small amount of baking soda. Perhaps this is just one of those breads that's best finished the old-fashioned way and not in the bread machine to allow for more control in mixing the cheese and in the rising. Nice flavor but I won't return to this recipe.",
