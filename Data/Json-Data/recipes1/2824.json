Fairly even amounts of the potato, rutabaga and parsnips ensured that each would contribute to create a new flavor all its own - and oh, what a wonderful flavor it was.  The \u201cicing on the cake\u201d was the caramelized onions on the top. What a rich and lovely finish, but you MUST let them cook slowly for a good, long time until they truly are golden brown and caramelized.  I half-heartedly made this as an alternative to mashed potatoes with our roast beef and gravy dinner tonight. While the entire dinner was perfect and delicious, this side dish single-handedly took my dinner from JUST delicious to exquisite.",

My mother-in-law always specifically asks me in advance about whether I am going to make this because she has come to look forward to it. One of our guests this year said it was the best thing on her plate. The parsnips and rutabaga give the potatoes a sweet/savory twist that is really tasty--different but not too different. This year I spaced out and boiled the vegetables in water instead of broth, and it was still as good as ever, so if necessary, you can omit the broth, I think. Caramelized onions really can't be beat, and in this dish they compliment the flavor perfectly. I caramelized a huge vidalia onion this year and it was awesome. I think that this recipe deserves to be a popular favorite.",
