The only thing I do differently is to use 2 jars of Smucker's caramel ice cream topping instead of the individually wrapped caramels and milk. Oh, and for personal preference, I use pecans instead of walnuts. I press the bottom lightly into the pan, bake for 10 minutes, then add nuts, chocolate and caramel. Then sprinkle on the topping and smush down as hard as possible without oozing the caramel through. After baking for 25 minutes, they come out perfect and not at all crumbly! PERFECTION! And if you mix all the oatmeal/flour/sugar/butter in a gallon sized zipper bag and then bake in a disposable foil pan, you don't have a single dish to do afterwards!!!!",
