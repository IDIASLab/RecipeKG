I also zapped 1/2 cup pecans in mini food processor and mixed them into the crust - made it delicious and crunchy. I had a few tablespoons of ricotta cheese that I mixed in with the phillie cheese - so I had to cook it a little longer - but I absolutely loved the flavor of the two cheeses. I used apples a plum and a pear on top (leftover fruit) - didn't have any almonds to add - can't wait to make it again! thanks for sharing!",

It took a little longer to cook and the smell was divine. When it came out of the oven I couldn't resist topping it off with a warm caramel sauce - just a little. I must say the smell from the oven was definitely an indication of how it was going to taste. This was gone in no time at all.  Very easy to make, but looks like something that came from a bakery!",

I had some apples and a block of cream cheese that I wanted to use up so I put those in to the ingredient search and this recipe caught my eye. My 7-year old loves cream cheese-based desserts and he loves apples so I knew this would be right up his alley. I did have a bit of difficulty spreading the crust into and up the sides of my springform pan. It kept sticking to my fingers. But I could have been a little off with the flour, you never know. Anyway, I persisted and this came out absolutely PERFECT!! It looks like you could have bought it in a bakery and tastes like it, too.  As we all neared the end of our slices, the sound was almost comical. All you could hear was each of our forks scraping the plates as we all tried to get every last bite :) The crust is delicious, the cheesecake filling is yummy and the cinnamon-sugar apples on top make a beautiful finish to one absolutely awesome dessert. The only thing I changed was I omitted the almonds as we are not big nut-eaters. I truly cannot believe so few people have tried this recipe. My husband already told me to make sure I put this in \"the binder\"...only true keepers go in there! Give this a try, you won't regret it!!! :)",
