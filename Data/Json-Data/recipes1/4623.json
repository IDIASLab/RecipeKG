Increased oil to 3-4 tbsp omitted thyme used 4 cups chopped tomatoes and 1/2 - 1 tsp salt. I sprinkle the salt on the tomatoes to help bring out the juices. As this recipe can be a little dry I also add approx. 2/3 cup chicken broth. I sprinkle parmesan cheese and toss and serve - EXCELLENT! We eat this often.",
