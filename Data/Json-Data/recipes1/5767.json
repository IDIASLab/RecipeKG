It adds a darker, deeper flavor and color.\r\n Also an addition of something acidic- rice wine vinegar, lemon juice, etc gives a nice contrast to the sugar and helps tenderize the meat.\r\n  I've used this marinade with a oven-stuffer roaster, boneless breasts & shrimp- it is a recipe that I can count on.
