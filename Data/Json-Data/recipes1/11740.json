I don't add anything but a little salt and pepper.\r\nThis receipe is very easy and can be so easily altered with different cheeses or meats.  It is my Easter brunch receipe, I make two of these the night before stick them in the fridge and in the morning pop them in the oven.  So easy.\r\nVery good tasting.",

I didn't think it tasted bad but it tasted just like the ingredients - mushy bread ham and processed cheese. Except for the fact that it was held in a square the eggs were undetectable (and I even added an extra one by mistake). This is not something I would serve to company. It sort of reminded me of something you would get in a school cafeteria. I doubt I will try this again. If I do I will make several changes. First I would use a sturdier bread (french as opposed to the wheat that I used) I would substitute real cheese for processed (probably a combination of cheddar and something else) I would cut back on the milk and butter too.",

I could see how this could be good I suppose--maybe if you used more bread or maybe toasted it before you used it to dry it out a bit? Maybe it was the bread I used. I'm not sure.
