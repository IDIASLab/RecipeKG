I've discovered that the fewer cookies on the cookie sheet the better, as they will spread out a little more and crackle even better!  Also, I recommend dipping only the tops in sugar - this way, they don't stick to the cookie sheet.))  Absolutely the best cookies I have ever made!  I was so excited to see that they had actually crackled and they looked so pretty and tasted amazing!  The recipe has oil in it so the dough may look a little different than you're used to, but I think this is what makes these cookies so wonderful.  I doubled the cinnamon and ginger, and *very* lightly greased my cookie sheets (or you can use parchment paper, because they will stick otherwise).  I baked them for 7 minutes at 350 F., and they were perfect - soft, crackled, and totally yummy!",

Here are the problems I encountered: The dough was too soft; I had to put it in the fridge and flour my hands when rolling the dough. The dough expands quite abit upon baking, so you will only need to roll till about the size of a walnut or smaller. The recipe's \"bake till firm in center\" is not really accurate as the cookies harden upon cooling. I followed the advice and got big ginger crackers. So you may want to cool the cookies after time's up to check their texture.",

After you make the dough, refrigerate it for about 5 - 10 mins so it's less sticky when you roll it. Make sure to leave 2 - 3 inches between cookies, these really do spread out!

Yellow decorator sugar looks prettier than granular sugar.\n* Don't over bake.  My slightly smaller (3 1/2/ doz yield) cookies took 10 minutes.\n* I didn't have cloves and substituted allspice.

Next, I added about 1/2 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger to the flour mixture.  Lastly, I rolled the cookies in turbinado sugar (Sugar in the Raw) which added a little more molasses flavor and extra crunch due to the larger crystals.  Baked for 10 minutes on parchment, cooled 5 minutes then transferred to a rack to cool completely.  Hubby ate four before I could get them into the cookie jar.  This will be our only ginger snap cookie recipe from now on.  Many thanks to Elaine for sharing!",
