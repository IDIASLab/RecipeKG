I also prepared it differently. The way that I prepared it takes much less time. Cook chicken in large saucepan over med/high heat; meanwhile follow directions on box of scalloped potatoes for STOVE TOP. When chicken is finished cooking and liquid runs clear, add potato mixture, cover, and reduce heat low/simmer for 20 min. While mixture is at simmer, dice up a ripe tomato and set aside. When 20 min. is up, add diced tomato along with bacon bits and pinch of oregano. My husband likes a lot of bacon bits, but you can do it to your taste. Recover for 5-10 min, or until done. You can even top it off with some shredded cheese when served to make it extra cheesy!",

Other than those two thing I think I would add veggies to it the next time to make it a complet meal. This was a great recipe for our family!",

I actually don't use boxed scalloped potatoes very much but I just happen to have some on hand to try this:) I added some sauteed mushrooms and onions (just b/c we LOVE these in just about ANYTHING) AND a little garlic powder. AND I \"missed\" the part about adding extra milk to the scalloped potatoes so I added it later (before folding but while potatoes were still hot) WITH a couple of TBS of Cream of Chicken soup I had in the fridge I needed to use up. I also added some bread crumbs and some green onions on the top too with the cheese (for flavor and color as well). It's a little time consuming (not difficult just not a really \"quick\" meal) but worth it:) It would be a GREAT recipe re the time when you had some leftover chicken already cooked. I was thinking after the fact it would be even BETTER with some bacon bits mixed in and/or on the top too just in case it's not FATTENING enough for you:)) I will definitely add it to my favorites for a great weeknite \"comfort food\" kind of meal.

The place that I got confused was when to add the actual potatoes to the scalloped potatoes. Next time I think that I will par-boil them per another review here.
