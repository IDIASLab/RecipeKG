I gave a '4' rating because of ease of presentation, just the right size for a 9x13 pan, they baked up beautifully in my oven for 28 minutes(just until they started to pull away from the sides of the pan), and there were no scorches, burns, and very evenly baked.  The texture is somewhere between cakey and fudgey so I think they would be suitable to please everyone on both ends of the sprectrum.  The color is not a deep chocolate color so do agree they need more chocolate, and they are not really sweet enough.  I am going to finish these off with a frosting and they will be lovely.  I did add a bunch of chopped walnuts to the batter but kept everything else the same.  They would be better if a bit more chocolate and sugar were in the recipe.  I'm still searching for a really fudgey rich brownie like my friend Joan used to make.",
