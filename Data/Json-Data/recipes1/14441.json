And that\u2019s not a bad thing, just a bit different.  Admittedly, I can be a bit of a pancake snob, but gotta tell you these pancakes are good!  They cooked up beautifully, they taste great, and they have just a little hint of sweetness.  cyndib, thanks for sharing your recipe, it\u2019s a keeper.",
