The cookies disappear quickly. The only changes I made to the recipe was to use granulated instead of brown sugar and to increase the vanilla to 1 teaspoonful. It also helps if the butter is at room temperature and very soft. Another thing I did with this recipe was to save the egg white and use it as an adhesive for the nuts I used in the centers of the cookies. I whisked the egg white made an indentation in the center of each cookie using the handle of a wooden spoon and then brushed the egg white in the center and added the chopped pecans. The first time I used nuts in the centers I didn't use the egg white and the nuts didn't stick nearly as well. The possibilities are many with this yummy cookie recipe.",
