I used petite-diced tomatoes, less celery, and added some frozen peas at the end of cooking for both color and flavor.  This was comfort food at it's best!",

I made some medallions for my brother and I just using the browning part while we waited for the stew and it was fantastic and tender.\n\nI followed other suggestions and used 2 cups beef stock, I think the 3 cups of water with the bouillon would have definitely been to soupy.\n\nI was also a little skeptical on the amount of wine but it turned out to be just fine in the end.\n\nI agree with a lot of other readers that you should rate a recipe based on as is no tweaks, if you want to tweak it then post your own recipe for review.  This one as is, is fantastic and will definitely be a keeper in our house.  Thank you very much for the post.",

Put just enough in to cover the meat, then add a bit more when veggies are added. Uncover for 10 mins at end to reduce the liquid so it's thick.",
