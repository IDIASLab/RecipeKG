UPDATE: We made these into cupcakes... actually used half-recipe and it made enough for 1 full pan of cupcakes. Cooked for about 15 minutes or so... they came out P-E-R-F-E-C-T. Didn't top them with anything as they were very rich and delicious as they were. It's so cool to say you made something so good from 'scratch.'

They didn't raise correctly (and I didn't open then oven) and the coffee flavor seems to somehow create an intensified burnt flavor at the bottom of each cupcake. Oh and the liners could not be pulled off without destroying the whole cupcake. So while this make work in layer cake form its unsuitable for cupcakes and seems to be a generally unstable recipe.
