A few hints for bakers trying this the first time....use real butter, not margarine. Not only will the cookies  bake better but part of the wonderful flavor they have is how buttery they taste. The butter flavor does intensify a bit after a couple of days. Also, the easiest way I've found to coat each cookie with the powdered sugar is by using a covered plastic container. Pour powdered sugar in the container and add a few cookies at a time. Shake them gently to coat. They don't look too coated after the first time, but the second coating will give you the beautiful snowball look that these cookies are famous for.",

Lift out by the bottom with fork, tap, and then place into 8AA cupcake liners.  Wonderful!!!",

I also bake these at 325 degrees for 20 mins.  Now when making the balls for the cookies I incorporate the whole  familys help.  With Christmas such a busy time you can relax with these as they are simple ( balls a little time consuming) taste great and go over well.  Thanx for a nice recipe!  I almost always add 2 tablespoons of vanilla and a half of almond or rum flavoring.Sounds like alot of flavoring but taste yummy!",

                "reviewBody": "Note that these don't spread or rise so you can bake a bunch on the cooky sheet which makes the preparation time for these balls much less than the average cooky. This is such a classic it's hard to think anybody couldn't find them in a comprehensive cookbook. I've got some old books from the '50's and they have it too. The nuts I've found are best if ground almost to a powder; small chunks can make them crumble even as you roll them. You need not restrict yourself to almonds either; almonds are wonderful especially if you add about a tsp. of almond extract with or instead of the vanilla. Here's a tip: chill the dough before forming balls. It makes it a bunch easier. Also if the dough wants to stick to your hands keep them dampened with clean water when rolling the balls. Oh and don't forget the second dusting with confectioner's (10x) sugar.",

I even made a batch with white whole wheat flour and it tasted wonderful; just added to the nutty buttery taste but made it just a tad healthier! =P I found smaller balls baked more like balls.

It's almost exactly the same as a Russian tea cake recipe from Betty Crocker's web site. The only variation is 3/4 cup finely chopped nuts instead of 1 cup chopped pecans. Also the baking instruction was 400 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes. Next time I will try 350 degrees for 15 minutes to see if the cookies turn out even better. Also I made another batch of dough using 3/4 cup toasted coconut instead of chopped nuts to put in the freezer for later use. I think that will yield delicious cookies for coconut fans.",
