I also used dark brown sugar rather than light because that's all I had (I also used a bit less assuming that dark brown sugar may have a stronger taste?). I also used natural fresh peanut butter because it was cheaper! It is a also more moist and thin than regular creamy peanut butter. I also cooked the bars in a round glass pan becuase it didn't look like they would fill up a 9 x 13 very easily. I cooked them for 18 mintues to keep them on the softer side. They were soooo good. I will definitely make this again! It was also so fast because you throw everything in one bowl and just mix it.",

And, to \"pour batter into prepared dish\" = SPREAD the dough in the pan because the \"batter\" is more like cookie dough, not like cake batter.  And, I actually baked them for only 15 minutes.  Soft & Yummy! Thank you :)",

I'm only giving it 3 stars though because after following the directions to a \"T\" and baking at the suggested amount it was still doughy. After being in the oven for still another ten minutes they were more firmer though the bars that were in the middle still were a bit doughy and fell-apart. Other than that a pretty good recipe thanks! I think next time I'll make them in a bigger pan making them thinner and possibly a little crispier.",
