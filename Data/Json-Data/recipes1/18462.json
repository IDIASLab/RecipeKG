Make sure the pastry sheet covers the whole sausage or hot dog (do not let the tip show too much) as the pastry will shrink when baking. If the dough is too sticky which will lead to a pastry too crumbly to handle, just simply put one or two more cups of flour into it ( i used whole wheat flour).",
