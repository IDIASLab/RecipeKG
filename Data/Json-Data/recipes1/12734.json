It's a soy protein. I found it at Trader Joes) To that I added the nutmeg onion and pepper and crumbed up toast. I did cut down the milk to 1/2 a cup. For the sauce I did have a bit of trouble but to solve that I added cold cubed butter and a bit more flour whisking that all together. Served everything over buttered noodles. It was just awesome! I will for sure make this over and over again!",

I used the morning star \"meat\" crumbles and I went to the grocerie store and forgot veggie broth so I used beef broth. Like the others it was hard keeping the meatballs together so I added an egg and that kind of helped. But with morning star it says the product only has to be heated to 160degreese so I made some into balls w/out browning them in the pan and they truned out good and stayed as balls!!! I mean for the sauce fake meat does not leave many juices anyway so I just added more butter to the pan when I was ready to make the sauce!",

Also since I didn't have half-and-half I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup soymilk. It came out very creamy and would I'm sure be appreciated by those who do like cream sauces. As for the meatballs I made some changes but they came out pretty well. I substituted matzo meal for breadcrumbs and soymilk for skim milk. Since many reviewers found it difficult to keep the mixture from losing its shape I added 1 egg and that worked perfectly. I also added about a teaspoon of allspice for more flavor. My brother the avid meat-eater said that these were good although they didn't taste like real meatballs. Coming from him that's high praise! I would probably make these again.

First I baked the meatballs on their own for about 40 minutes at 400 degrees and on a sheet of parchment paper so they wouldn't stick to the baking sheet. I've tried similar vegetarian protein recipes in the frying pan and never had much luck getting them to hold together so I decided to skip the pan and go straight to the oven this time. Plus a higher heat unlocks the spices more. Second I included a spice rub in the recipe that my brother makes. He refuses to tell me what is in it but I know it has sea salt oregano a smoked paprika and a few other things I haven't figured out yet. The point is include a little good-quality salt and a source of heat and you'll be pleased with the outcome.",
