For those who found the pie too runny but don't want to go through the hassle of pre-cooking the rhubarb, try using a lattice top instead of the double crust called for in the recipe. It lets alot of the moisture out. Also, be sure to let the filling sit the whole 30 min before pouring into crust, and let the pie sit in the oven 15-20 min after baking (oven should be turned OFF) to let the excess fluids thicken. If you do all of those steps, the pie won't be runny, nor will it taste floury.",

I removed the pot from the stove & added the raw strawberries.  I poured the mixture into the crust & dotted with butter.  It turned out much better with the cornstarch.

With pies like this, you cannot just cut into them fresh from the oven, or they run all over the place. I made this at 9 at night, then cut into it the next day in the afternoon, no runniness at all.

And that means the recipe is excellent.  I didn't change a thing, nor will I in the future. I can only think that those who experienced a runny pie either cut into it before it was completely cooled, or didn't cook it long enough - when you see the juices bubble up through the vented crust, that's a pretty good indicator the pie is done.  I used \"Basic Flaky Pie Crust,\" also from this site, and the result was simply a beautiful and delicious pie.  ",

I went strawberry picking yesturday and made the pie today along with local fresh rhubarb. i changed the recipe by using 3 cups each of strawberries and rhubarb. i didn't use the flour but instead (as previously mentioned) mixed 1/4 cup of water with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and let it sit with the berries, rhubarb and sugar for 30 minutes. i also baked the pie for 15 minutes at 425 and then 40 minutes at 375. we let the pie cool for about 3-4 hours and it's not runny at all!! this was so good that i'm making 2 more of these pies to give to my family and neighbor! also just a note - you don't need to cook the rhubarb before hand - you need to make sure it's chopped up (about 1/4 inch) and also if you notice the skin is a little tough, peel it a little bit. thanks so much for a recipe that i'll definitely use again and again!!",

What I found out however,is that if you wait 1 day after baking the pie, the juice inside seems to thicken a little bit. You could also use some tapioca to thicken the filling, but this only takes away from the natural flavor of the fruit filling.  Using a little bit more flour or substituting flour for cornstarch also makes the filling a bit thicker.",
