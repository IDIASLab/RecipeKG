I gotta tell you, this recipe is an AWESOME way to sneak in those veggie soy crumbles (looks like ground beef, but doesn't always taste like it...except it TOTALLY works in this recipe).  Definitely make the sauce as suggested by another reviewer (1 tsp sesame oil, 2 T soy, 2 T rice vinegar, 1 T chile paste)...in my opinion, the sauce makes this a 5-star recipe!  I used regular fresh ginger rather than pickled, and shredded some carrots to serve on top of everything.  I would have LOVED to have those nice crunchy noodle-y things, but once I heard they are fried in oil, I had to say \"no thanks!\"  I'm definitely going to make these again (they're really easy to make, by the way) and will also pass on the recipe!",

I've tried many different variations and can attest that this recipe is top-notch.  \r\n\r\nHowever, instead of ground beef, most Chinese restaurants use ground pork or duck.  Except for substituting ground beef for ground pork and omitting the pickled ginger (since I didn't have any in the house), I made no changes to the recipe.  As a suggestion, try serving the meat over a bed of crispy rice noodles (vermicelli) as I've seen done in many restaurants.  Simply heat some oil and dunk a small handful of noodles at a time...they crisp up in a couple of seconds.  Not only does it make the presentation nice, it adds a nice crisp crunch to the meat mixture.  \r\n\r\nAlso, for extra burst of flavour, put a bit of hoisin sauce (see recipe here as well) before wrapping it up in a lettuce leaf, as one other person suggested.",

I did add a very healthy portion (perhaps up to 2 tbsn) of Thai sweet chili pepper sauce (looks like a clear gelatin with red confetti in it).  I thought this tasted EXACTLY like PF Chang's, but without the hefty appetizer price.  The key to getting the taste just right, is the sesame oil. (It has a strong flavor & if it's missing, won't quite taste the same as PF Chang's, but don't over do it!)  For serving these as an appetizer, I used the leaves from butter (Bibb) lettuce. They are sturdy enough, but much smaller than iceberg and have a vibrant green color so they make the perfect appetizer ingredient or the perfect size for kids.",

Very hard to do as we feel that's what fills us instead of meat. I was looking for a good recipe besides our normal pasta, veggie burgers, fruit, and veggies. I came across this recipe and thought that I could make it using Vegetarian Ground Beef (I prefer Boca). It worked out perfectly. I just made it all in one pot. I substituted ground ginger for fresh and left out the chile and chestnuts. Used a little extra soy sauce, and we toasted some sesame seeds and chopped cashews for some crunch.
