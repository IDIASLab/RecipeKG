See now, if I didn't know any better, I wouldn't have rolled the dough into a rectangle & then rolled it (like a jelly roll) into a \"loaf\", making a seam...to put \"seamside\" down. BUT I just assumed that rolling was the way to go & the bread turned out great.  I don't have a bread machine, so I made it using my kitchen aid w/ the dough hook.  I also took it out of the oven after 15 minutes & brushed it again with egg white & that also gave it a very nice crust.  I liked the addition of brown sugar in this recipe compared to my normal recipe.  Thanks for the tip Verla!",

I ended up adding about 3/4 C. more flour just so it would knead into a ball. It was still rather hard to handle but I did manage to get it into loaves. Thankfully the end result was super! I strongly urge that 5 minutes in the oven before serving; it was the finishing touch for a nice crusty loaf! Will make again.",

Also a 3:1 ratio of flour to water generally works best for me so I used just one cup of water. Sandwich-style loaves are most practical for us so I baked this in a glass loaf dish at 350 degrees about 35 minutes. I greased the pan and used the egg wash but skipped the cornmeal and sesame seeds. Very pleased - good basic home-style white bread.",
