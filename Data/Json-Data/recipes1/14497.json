It called for 4 cups of diced apple (that\u2019s a lot, and a lot to dice, as well), and that\u2019s simply too many apples IMO.  If you look at my photo, you\u2019ll see diced apple sticking out everywhere.   I have to think that both the amount of apples and walnuts could be reduced in this recipe. and some liquid somewhere.  The batter was so thick that I could barely mix it.  The walnuts were the last thing that I added, and I stopped at less than 1 cup because I was having difficulty incorporating the nuts.  As we all know, \u201cwe eat with eyes\u201d and, unfortunately, this had no eye appeal, almost looked a bit like meatloaf.  It\u2019\u2019s also difficult to slice without falling apart, but on the positive side, it is very moist, apple-y, and tastes pretty darn  good.  Baked in 4 mini loaf pans (for better portion control for us) for 35 minutes at 350\u00baF.",
