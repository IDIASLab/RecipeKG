I brown butter for my cookies but I'd never thought of doing it for frosting and I was pleasantly surprised. I used some of my boyfriend's 18 year Elijah Craig bourbon (shhhh!!) and it was heavenly. Definitely don't use something cheap! I used this to frost a carrot cake and it was a perfect combination. Just a tip for first time butter-browners: make sure you have extra butter on hand just in case you burn the first batch!",

I made 2 versions: Only changes I made were to use vanilla extract (1 to 1 1/2 tsp.) and slightly less bourbon (personal preference). I also omitted the heavy cream and reduced the sugar slightly--just added to taste. If you want a non-alcoholic version just omit the whiskey (add milk/cream instead) and add a couple drops of maple extract for a delicious alternative flavor. This is not a very stiff frosting but would work well for sheet cakes or cupcakes. I will definitely be making this again!!",
