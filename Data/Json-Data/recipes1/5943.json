Tastes like true European bread that one could get in a bakery or very nice restaurant. \n\nFor those who had problems with dryness, I used 2 cups of flour to start with, as stated in the recipe, and then added until the dough felt right. Definitely not the entire half cup, perhaps a quarter cup or slightly less. \n\nI let it rise about an hour and a half.\n\nAlso, I had a pan of water at the bottom of the often to provide moisture for the first twenty minutes or so of baking. I don't have anything to mist with, so I relied entirely on that method. \n\nEnded up with a great crust and soft tasty inside. All in all, it's pretty addictive, and I feel I could almost eat a whole loaf in one night.",

The ball should be sticky but not too sticky. This will prevent your bread from becoming dry or having too much flour in the recipe. bread recipes are tricky and the liquid amount varies depeding on where you live and what time of year it is. We live in Arizona and I used 1 cup of water.",
