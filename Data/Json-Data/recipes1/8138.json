The bartender will usually run the moist part of the lemon rind over the rim of the glass, then drape the rind over the rim so that part of the rind falls in the drink. A Highball glass is a tall glass, if you do not have a Highball glass, any tall glass will do.",

But\u2026please, don\u2019t make this. If this had 2 ounces (maybe even 3) of sweet vermouth with a dash or even two or three of bitters, this may have been OK. An ounce of bitters just destroyed it. At a ratio of two for sweet vermouth and one for bitters, it simply was undrinkable.",
