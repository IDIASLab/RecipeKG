If you line your pepperoni on a few paper towels and microwave them for about 15-20 seconds before you put them in the oven you can get a lot of the grease off before hand & they don't smoke as much in the oven. Just make sure to watch them closely. I take mine out when the centers are still a little bit chewy they crisp up when they cool and its a good way to make sure you don't over bake them.",

I just ran about 7 batches of these through the microwave in 20 second increments on paper towels to soak up the grease in about 30 min. It takes about 4 to 5 rotations per batch. They are crisp but not burned the house isn't smoked up and they are ready for snacking tonight. My guys are going to love these. Best part is...someone gave us 5 gallon size ziplocs full of pepperoni some time back...they've been in the freezer. So now I know what to do with them!",

The first bite I took must've been one of the slices I sprinkled a little too much seasoning on bc my mouth was a bit on fire after it. When all is said and done not so sure these are my favorite. If you love crispy spicy bacon these are wonderful. I tried them a couple of different ways because not all of the pepperoni fit on the pan the first time. I tried it with the cajun seasoning first then baked without. Either way isn't too bad--just a matter of taste. If you like spicy and are worried about the salt there are a few salt free cajun spice mixes on here that you could use. If you're not a big fan of spicy I would recommend you not use the cajun seasoning. However I'm not a huge fan of crispy bacon and so I don't think it's quite for me. Still I am glad I tried them. Took a bit of time and effort and now I know what they taste like!:o) Thanks for the recipe.",

It was very late at night and I was so worried the fire alarm would go off and wake everybody up. I grabbed the cookie sheet and ran with it outside. They were burnt...so I figured it was my fault. So i trashed them I made a 2nd batch. I sopped up the oil after a few minutes and they immediately started to smoke again and once again I had to run outside with the smoking pepperoni! This time they were NOT burnt after everything was said and done my house was smokey and smelled like pepperoni. I wont make these in the oven again...just not worth it.",
