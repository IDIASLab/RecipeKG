Since the cooking sauce is rather thin I'd take the meat out shred it and with just a bit of the sauce refrigerate it overnight. Then the next day skim the fat off for a healthier meal. I served mine on buns with if desired a bit of KC Masterpiece barbeque sauce. For a great meal serve with this site's Sweet Restaurant Slaw. The combination can't be beat!",

I skipped the step of browning it first and don't think it made any difference. But this isn't a BBQ Pork sandwich which is what I was going for. So after shredding the roast I poured the liquid out of my crockpot and put the shredded pork in with a bottle of BBQ sauce stirred and cooked till warmed through. MM MM MM good. My husband was so impressed. This tasted just as good as anything we could get at a BBQ restaurant. And it reheats easily and tastes just as good the next day. As for this recipe it makes a good pork sandwich but I prefer something a little zestier. And I would reduce the brown sugar to 2 Tbs. since the sweetness was too much. I would highly recommend this recipe.",

But I added a little bit of liquid smoke to this to help it out and when I browned the pork I added oil with lots of salt and pepper for flavor. The sauce is a sweeter BBQ sauce but I thought it was perfect - so good! The directions say to take the meat out and cut it but I couldn't even take it out without it falling apart on me! I cooked it for about 6-7 hours on high and wow it was amazing. And since I couldn't take the meat out of the crockpot I just used a knife to shred the meat right in there instead of having to dirty another dish.",
