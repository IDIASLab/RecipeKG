This was an extrememly rich complex-tasting french toast with minimal preparation involved. This paired perfectly with mimosas!",

I only used 6 pieces of white bread so I halved the other ingredients as well but found that the bread was really dry. I ended up mixing up the remaining amounts and adding them to the shallow pan. After about 5 minutes I flipped the bread pieces and let them sit for another 5 minutes before putting them on the grill. Just awesome! I also did not have any oranges to make the zest but the flavor was still exceptional!",

In place of all that sugar I used salt and pepper. Then I deep-sixed the orange liqueur and orange zest and put some iced cold tequila in a glass whose rim had been generously salted. I knocked that back and shot gunned a couple of Michelobs. Then I threw the French steaks on a skillet turned up the heat fell asleep and burned down my kitchen.
