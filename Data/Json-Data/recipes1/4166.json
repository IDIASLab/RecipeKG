I didn't have any parmesean cheese so I used mozerella in my pasta and on top I am a vegetarian so I cut the meat out and used mushrooms zuchinni and green pepper instead. I also didn't have any ricotta or cottage cheese in my fridge so I cut that out as well. So I layered pasta sauce garlic infused veggie mix more sauce then more cheese. It was really good. My whole family enjoyed it. I am sure it's better with added ricotta but it's defitely not a must. Thanks for a great recipe I will defintely make this again.",
