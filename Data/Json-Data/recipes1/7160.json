Add 1 stick low fat marg., lemon juice and frozen shrimp.  Served over mini ziti and sprinkled with parmesan.  Left out mushrooms as my husband doesn't like them.  Using my version the meal is considerably lower in fat and you eliminate a step by not steaming asparagus.  Taste was very fresh, light and healthy.  Will definitely make this again next spring!",

Then, at the same time I had the egg noodles cooking and also cooked the shrimp, butter, a pinch of minced garlic, the lemon juice and added a few dashes of Creole Seasoning.  This reduced the cooking time and then I was able to just throw it all together and serve it warm.  By adding the Creole seasoning, it gave it more flavor, and I will continue to do that each time I make this recipe.  I have already shared this recipe with a couple friends who have all made it and thought it was wonderful!  Thanks again for a quick, easy and very tasty meal!!",

I did what one reviewer suggested and sauted the asparagus in olive oil then set aside until I had sauted the shrimp a few minutes. I used the juice of one lemon. To spice up the flavor a bit, I added red pepper flakes and a bunch of Old Bay seasoning. It would have been a bit bland without the red pepper/Old Bay. My husband and I both enjoyed it with these changes. It was very good reheated the next day as well.",

I didn't follow the cooking directions, the shrimp needs to be the last ingredient or it would be too tough by the time the mushrooms cook. I just sauteed the garlic in the oil and then added the butter, asparagus and mushrooms, once they were just about tender, I tossed in the shrimp for about three minutes until tender and pink. Then poured that mix into the already waiting egg noodles.  I'm sure if you wanted to use a whole cup of butter it would be even better...but I didn't want the extra calories and no one here noticed.",

Halved the recipe for just my husband and myself and still have a lot left over. Used Angel Hair pasta instead of egg noodles. I sauted garlic (will use more next time) in olive oil (WAY TO MUCH called for in recipe (1/8 cup all that's needed for serving of 4 if that) and then added butter (again to much - will use 1/4 cup for serving 4 instead of 1/2) lemon juice asparagus (raw) and some white wine. Skipped mushrooms cause neither my husband or I like them. After the asparagus was almost fully cooked I added 1 lb of lg shrimp and 1 tbsp of Salt Free Poultry seasoning and pepper to taste. Did not add any salt at all. When shrimp was fully cooked I removed shrimp/asparagus from sauce added 1 tbsp of cornstarch diluted in a splash of white wine to avoid clumping to thicken the sauce - then tossed pasta sauce and shrimp/asparagus together. Served w/ fresh out of the oven pillsbury simply rustic french bread. Forgot to top w/ Parmesan but didn't need it - was still good. So much oil left on the plate after we ate we used it for dipping w/ the bread. Could use more vegetables - maybe some zucchini and carrots - overall taste is awesome - just trying to cut back on fats cholesterol and salt so reducing amt of oil and butter is good - use white wine and cornstarch to increase amt of sauce if you want more. Loved the simplicity of it. Looking forward to making again!",
