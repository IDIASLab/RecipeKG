It was a little time consuming seperating the eggs but it really made the cake light and fluffy. By doubling the recipe I got 3 eight inch cakes and two 14 inch cakes... which made a nice two tier birthday cake for my friend. Overall I was satisfied with the basic recipe, it was a very light and moist cake.. but the flavor was changed.",

The flavor of the mace is perfect since they were looking for a spice cake for their fall wedding (and they also love donuts - mace is the spice used in cake donuts). I forgot to split the sugar and ended up adding it all with the flour and butter so my egg whip was a little wrong. But the flavor is really wonderful and I think the texture will be too when done correctly. I baked this smaller batch for only 40 minutes and then let it sit in the oven (turned off) for about 15 mins.",
