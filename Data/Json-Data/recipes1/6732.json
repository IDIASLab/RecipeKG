As another Texan reviewer mentioned it is almost identical to King Ranch casserole if you make it with plain corn tortilla chips which is what I had on hand. I also made a few other modifications; Added about 1.5 cups of coursely chopped white onion (wish I hadnt red or green would have been better). I poached the chicken in a T of olive oil 4 small cloves of garlic salt pepper and mesquite seasoning adding about half a can of tomatoes with green chile and juice. The flavor from that was good. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of slicing the processed cheese and I think I won't do that again - shredding would have gotten a more even consistency. I added a layer of finely crushed ships over that and topped it with shredded mixed cheese (monterrey jack and colby) - this made a great topping. Topped it with black pepper and parsley. My boyfriend had 3 servings - he loved it!",
