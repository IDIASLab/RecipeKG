The only change I made is to add a tsp of cinnamon to the dough because that's how my mom made them and I knew from experience that the subtle spice showcases the date flavor and lets it shine. Toasted pecans make a tasty substitute for walnuts. A hint to keep the round shape of your rolls. Wrap the rolls tightly in plastic wrap then put each end into a tall glass (mine are 16 oz) and lay the glasses (with the dough in them) on their sides in the freezer. The rolls will stay perfectly round. Yes of course it's true that these are a little labor-intensive but that was pretty clear to me before I even started making them just from reading the recipe. If I wanted fast and easy I'd make a drop cookie. These are well worth the time. Besides the filling can be made one day the dough made filled and frozen the next and then they can be baked anytime afterward up to a month or even longer if tightly wrapped airtight. Take it in steps if you don't want to make a career out of them. Once you bake them you'll want to do it again.",

I grew up with cookies very similar to these and wanted to recreate them. After tasting these I think I like these better. I'm pretty sure my mother didn't use lemon juice/zest but I did. It cuts through the sweetness of the dates. The citrus really comes through. The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the dough. If you have an electric knife this is a great time to use it. It makes cutting these cookies a breeze!",
