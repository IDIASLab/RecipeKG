Therefore, I substituted cheddar cheese for the american cheese and bacon for the ham.  The other thing I always always do is sautee the vegetables (onion & celery) first.  I just prefer the flavors that sauteeing brings out.  I Fried the bacon and set aside.  Used 2 tbsp. of bacon drippings to sautee the onion & celery then followed the recipe as stated.  I added the bacon (crumbled) at the point where the ham would have been added.  This is by far my favorite potato soup recipe that I've tried.",
