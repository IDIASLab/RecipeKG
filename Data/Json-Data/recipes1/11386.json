My latest, delicious addition was some shredded, leftover zucchini I had from making zucchini bread.",

For onion flavor, I added onion powder.  Also, I grated the potatoes into a bowl of cold water to prevent discoloration then wrung them out in a dishtowel to remove moisture.  They held together very well and were great served with sausage, biscuits, eggs & gravy.  What a yummy breakfast!",

I use a bit more oil to aid the bottom to crisp.  Cooking covered 15 to 20 minutes each side over medium heat also insures the potato in the middle is done. Upon flipping I add another tablespoon or two of oil to cook the other side crisp. It's manageable to flip if cut in quarters by using a firm spatula. My family does not like these unless they are crispy, crisping really ups the flavor and adds texture.  Definately serve with a dollop of sour cream, I like the green onion garnish idea as well.",
