The only thing that didn't make this recipe a 5 star was that I felt it was missing just a little something and if I am going to spend time caramelizing onions (and I have a passion for caramelized onions) the resulting dish should be perfect. The next time I made the recipe I added some toasted pine nuts becuse I felt the missing ingredient was more a textural than a taste thing. It was stunning! Two points I would make are; One - I found it best to add the spinach when the pasta is nice and hot so the spinach wilts enough so that the rawness of it is taken away. Two - (For the onion timid) Four onions is not too many for this recipe! In fact make them four nice big ones and a pinch of sugar to help the caramelization process along you won't regret it!",

I wish I had added even more (smile) Just a note I think this might have the potential to become dry so I used a bit of the water that I cooked the orzo in before it became dry. Last note like another person mentioned I added the spinach to the hot orzo so that the spinach would wilt a bit.",
