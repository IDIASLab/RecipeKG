        "description": "My mother made this recipe for pinto beans with ground beef for us as kids and I have used it many times in feeding my 4 boys. When the space shuttle fell, our small town filled up overnight with searchers for the space shuttle debris, and this is one of the recipes that I used to help feed the masses. It was a hit every time. We served it with cornbread and a side salad for a complete meal or over a bed of rice. My mom would top off a bowl of this with homemade sweet salsa. Yum!",
