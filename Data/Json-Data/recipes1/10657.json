IMHO store brought crust just lacks in taste & texture.  Once you compare the two, you'll see what I mean. For a homemade crust you Just need to crush about 24 regular oreos in a food processor and had about 1/4 c melted butter  to help keep it together.  That's it. A very easy step that will improve your end result greatly.  Also a springform pan is a MUST to cut & serve the pie. I used to make it in a glass pie plate and the crust would freeze like a rock to the bottom. The springform pan is a lifesaver!  I also drizzle a little Magic Shell topping in chocolate over the top..  My mom has been making this same recipe for at least 25 years and it NEVER fails to impress. A classic!",

I didn't have any creme de menthe liqueur so I used Creme de Menthe Torani's syrup instead so maybe that's what contributed to the lack of flavor? Anyway I gave it a second try for my husband's birthday as he LOVES mint and ended up added nearly 2T of peppermint extract to the mint syrup which really added to the flavor. I added a dash of syrup to the crumb mixture too. I also cut down on the butter because as much as I love butter 1/2 C was WAY too much and made it difficult to get it to cling to the bottom. Finally I didn't reserve any cookie for the top and instead melted some chocolate chips over a double-broiler with some peppermint extract and drizzled it over the top which made it look 5-star and quite stunning. After the revisions I ended up really liking it but as it was originally written... not my favorite.",
