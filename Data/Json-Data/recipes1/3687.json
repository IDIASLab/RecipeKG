                "reviewBody": "Okay, first of all, it's true that the use of water instead of condensed milk really enhances the flavour of the lime.  But what I can't understand is why the recipe states to add the lime juice after the rest of the filling is cooked.  In my case, the filling was nice and thick up until this point, but the lime juice diluted it so much that it was like soup when I poured it into the pie shell, foolishly hoping that a brief stint in the oven would help it set.  Well, it never set, even after a  night in the refrigerator.  But I hate to waste, so the next day, I poured out the filling, reheated it with a little more flour until it got thick, then poured it back into the pie shell and baked it again.  This time it came out beautiful and perfectly set, even without refrigeration.  So I would definitely recommend this recipe - just don't do what I did and pour in the filling unless it is thick enough to form ribbons when stirred.  If it is too soupy, add more flour or cook it a little longer, but don't hope for it to set up in the oven, because it won't!",

This was outstanding! Stood up so nicely was not soupy cut into nice slices and sooo creamy. I think the flour is the key to creaminess. The only mods. I made were to add more lime zest and used 1/2 cup of key lime juice and cut the water accordingly. I also used lime-essence water instead. The lime water is great if you can find it. I get it at CVS drugstore in the dollar aisle! It is simply bottled water with a faint essence of lime. This recipe is a keeper. I used the french pastry pie crust from this site and it all turned out so nicely. remember to keep egg whites at room temp when making meringue and make sure that beaters and bowl are free from any oil or fat or meringue will not set up.",

It has the perfect balance of sweet and tart and it s so full of key lime flavor. I had never made anything with key limes before this pie and I was surprised with how small key limes are so I had no idea how many I would need to get the amount of juice and zest needed for this recipe. The limes I used were cherry tomato-sized. It took about 7 limes (1/4 lb.) to get cup juice and an additional 3 limes (10 total) to get the 1 Tbsp. zest. I think the trick to getting the pie to set up after adding the juice and butter is to bring it back up to a boil. I also stirred the mixture a couple of times while it cooled in the pan a little before pouring into the crust. I used a graham cracker crust (brushed with an egg wash and prebaked at 375 for 5 minutes) and the meringue turned out lovely as written.",

My grandmother is from Key West and has very strict requirements in order for a pie to be considered a \"real\" Key Lime Pie - it must have a traditional pastry crust instead of graham cracker it must have meringue - not whipped cream and it should be yellow never green! This recipe meets all the the requirements and is exactly like the ones my Gramma has always made! So excited to share this recipe!",

I especially like it that no condensed milk is required so the fruit taste really stands out--cheaper and healthier without the condensed milk too. Also this meringue recipe is better than the one I used to make--simpler and never fails. Two tips: Make sure the filling doesn't look thin before you add it to the pie shell. If it does look thin cook it a little longer at a slightly higher temperature until it has a pudding-like consistency. Second make sure you clean your beaters thoroughly before doing the meringue and see that they're cool. I put mine in the fridge (along with the bowl and utensils) until it's time to use them. You can also make the meringue first so that you don't have to clean the beaters etc. before you use them to do the egg yolks. (If your kitchen is warm put the bowl of meringue in the fridge until it's time to top the pie.) Anyway thanks very much Jack for this great recipe. Can't wait to try it for orange pineapple and other fruit-juice pies.",

I also used bottled lime juice both times and think fresh would have been better. The first time I followed the recipe and found I needed extra corn starch to thicken after adding the lime juice. It was also SO sweet that I threw it out and made a second one. The second time I used 1.5c water and 1c lime juice plus added a half tablespoon extra corn starch in the beginning and it was MUCH better. I also made fresh whipped cream instead of the meringue as it was still very sweet. I guess in the end I just don't like my deserts sickly sweet even with a zing of lime. Here's a picture prior to the whipped cream!",
