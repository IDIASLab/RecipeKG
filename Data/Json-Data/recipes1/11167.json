I use this to make chocolate ice cream by using chocolate pudding and adding 1 cup melted chocolate chips to batter.  To make banana I use vanilla pudding and add about 4-5 pureed bananas to batter. I cook this recipe also, I usually heat milk and sugar until hot, then add eggs and either bananas or melted chocolate to batter and cook for 1-2 minutes longer (I find if eggs are beaten well before adding to hot mixture they will not cause lumps in batter). Then I remove from heat and add the heavy cream and other ingredients.  Also, I use 2 cups cream and less milk-very rich and creamy!!!!!!      cat h.",

I'd highly suggest that.  This is an ice cream without tons of heavy cream and 1/2 and 1/2, but it still has the rich creamy flavor -- TRY IT!!!! :)",

I tried this recipe and thought that it was very easy to make.  I put the mixture in a blender to get the lumps out of the mixture from the vanilla.  Did not bother to do anything with the eggs, since my husband and I would be eating it and we are not elderly.  Used the 32 serving recipe and put it in a 5 quart electric freezer.  It \"stopped\" in 20 minutes and we let the freezer sit for a couple of hours with a towel over the top.  It is pretty creamy and did not get hard.\r\nBut the taste and consistency was fabulous!  My husband loved it and we will try this again for our September family reunion.  This is a great recipe!!!!",
