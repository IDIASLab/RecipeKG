I used HALF of an Old Bay seafood one-step shrimp & crab boil 3 oz package and instead of the jalapenos some (about half cup?) tabasco sauce. I also added some kosher salt (1-2 cups?) since I like em salty. Cooked them in the crock pot on high stirring occasionally for 10-12 hours. Had no problems with maintaining water level. The taste was fantastic and due to popular demand had to make a second batch the next day.",

There was NO NEED to add any salt! The mustard seeds in the crab boil were salty enough! Now it tastes saltier than pure salt!
