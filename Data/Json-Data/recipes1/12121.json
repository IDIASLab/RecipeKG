I downsized the recipe and used one cheesecake and one vanilla sugar-free instant pudding.  I also didn't have any sour cream, so I didn't include it in the pudding.  I also used extra splenda because I thought it couldn't hurt.  Yummy!",

I did use lowfat cream cheese, yogurt in place of sour cream, lite cool whip, 2 packages of sugar free pudding (couldn't find 1 oz pkgs); no sweetener and 4 cups of milk.  It came together quickly and made for a very nice presentation.  Taste was good, but I have had better banana pudding.  Company really liked it and that is what mattered to me.",

OMIT the artificial sweetener. You won't need it now. Keep the mixer going thruout, except when you add the Cool Whip. use 2 tsp vanilla extract.Cut up the ROOM TEMP Neuftechel cheese, as you add it to the mixer, so it incorporartes smoothly. Make sure you use INSTANT   pudding, using French Vanilla flavor, if you can find it. Shut off mixer before adding  thawed cool whip, & gently incorporate with a whisk. Let it set while you assemble cookies in the pan or bowl. Slice in bananas over cookies & add pudding. Put rest of cookies or crumbles on top. Cool in refrig to set. Tastes better the 2nd day, so make the day before.",
