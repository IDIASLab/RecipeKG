I sliced it in half and served it with cream and jam in the middle I will be cooking more of my own cakes in future as it is not as difficult or time comsuming as I imagined. The only thing I did differently with this recipe was I beat the egg yolks and white separately and folded into mixture. Thankyou Carol for inspiring the home baker in me.",

The cake is moist and looked great (i used 4 eggs) although a bit too sweet for my taste (maybe coz i didn't use the lemon juice - i used raspberry extract instead so there's no sourness to balance the sugar). And i did separate the whites and the yolk like the other reviewer said and i greased the pan with butter. It worked wonders..",

But it may not be sweet enough for others but I thought the vanilla was enough for me. Served it with a spoonful of vanilla yogurt and strawberries whole fam enjoyed it too. Thanks for sharing!!",
