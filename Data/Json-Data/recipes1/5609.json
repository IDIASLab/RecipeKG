That said, I took into consideration a couple of reviewers' comments -  the cake was dry, the cake wasn't butterscotchy enough - and made a couple of changes to address them.  To add more butterscotch flavor I used  a butter pecan cake mix (just so happened to have one on hand) and substituted 1/4 cup of butterscotch schnapps for part of the milk called for.  An alternative might be to add some Watkins caramel flavoring or rum extract, maybe a teaspoon.  I couldn't see the point of using egg whites and wasting four egg yolks - this isn't a white cake.  So I used whole eggs - two instead of the four egg whites called for and a third for added moistness.  While the cake was cooling I kind of just winged it and threw together a butterscotch glaze using butterscotch chips, heavy cream, and just a little butter and corn syrup (for gloss).  The verdict?  The small changes must have worked because it's moist and butterscotchy, so butterscotch lovers (like Hubs) will be pleased!",
