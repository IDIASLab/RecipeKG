My layers went like this: Tortilla, refried beans, beef mixture, cheese, tortilla, beef mixture, cheese, tortilla, salsa and a lil more cheese. My mom and grandma tried it at lunch today and loved it as well. I served it with sour cream. The only thing I would do different next time is use 1 1/2 lb of hamburger.

As a side dish I make a mexican style rice: chopped onions, red & green peppers saut\u00e9ed together, add rice, then a broth to cover the rice, add red or pinto beans and some corn, and allow to simmer till the rice is tender.
