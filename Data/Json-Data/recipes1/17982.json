Even though I had to use ground cinnamon (I had ground up all my cin sticks previously) and used a few shakes of 5 spice (didn't have star anise) AND grated in fresh nutmeg vs cloves...this turned out really well. Only did half the recipe (for 2 of us). As good as it was then I realized I had 1/2 C of crushed pineapple I wanted to use up so that got incorporated too. Also did half sugar & 1/2 honey. If per chance you have leftovers I used mine (about 2/3 C) for a sweet n sour sauce base (added water then strained) and it was an interesting way to create something else from this. Probably would be good for a pork roast glaze also. Just some ideas. Thanks Chef John!",
