First, I do not rinse the seeds at all - just get the big hunks of pumpkin and strings out - a little pumpkin on the seeds gives it flavor!  Second, I spray my cookie sheet and seeds with Pam.  Third, I've never measured the salt, just sprinkle salt as if you were salting fries to your own taste.  (You can always add more after they're out of the oven)  Fourth, I prefer a little cooler oven - 300 - and just wait until they smell fantastic and just barely golden brown.  (45 mins to an hour) Turn the oven off and let them stay in the oven another 45 mins or so.  Mmmmm..... ",
