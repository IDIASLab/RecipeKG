Using crushed pineapple will dilute the whipped topping and make the salad soupy. Pecans work well with this but the recipe stands on its own: creamy fruity sweet good stuff. If you make it and serve immediately it will be creamy and fluffy; if you wait a few hours it will be firmer but still smooth; just depends on your preference we like it both ways.",
