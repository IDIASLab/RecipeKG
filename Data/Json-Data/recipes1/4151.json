(A restaurant we visited served a White Bean and Cabbage Soup so I went searching for a recipe and came upon this one.) An 11.5 oz can of V-8 is just the right size to use in this recipe since it equates roughly to 1 1/2 cups. I chopped the cabbage very finely and I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic minced 1 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. black pepper and 1/4 tsp. Tabasco when I added the broths. Save yourself time and effort - there is absolutely no need to microwave the carrots and celery - just add them in raw along with the other ingredients. I only added 2 cans of water since I prefer a thick soup and I brought the soup to a boil and then lowered the temp. to simmer it for 2 hours. Didn't see the need to boil the soup for 30 minutes in addition to 2 hrs. of simmering! The soup turned out perfectly and the black pepper along with the Tabasco gave it a very slight bite. This is a keeper!",

If you check out 'Cabbage Fat-Burning Soup,' 'Minestrone Soup,' and 'Kielbasa Stew' you'll see they are all pretty much variations on the same theme. So, add whatever veggies you have on hand (potato, green beans, peas, corn, zucchini etc); beans are great (I use kidney beans or black-eye peas). If you want meat, you can throw in sliced brats, kielbasa, or even cooked and crumbled bacon. Pasta also makes for a hearty soup/stew. I like to top it with a little grated Cheddar cheese, and, served with a biscuit or some buttered brown bread, it makes for a really great meal. Fantastic!",
