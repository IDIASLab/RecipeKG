This is kind of a 'whatever is handy now' recipe. You can use a whole roasting chicken cut into bite-sized pieces, or just breasts and thighs if you prefer.  Other suggested additions are turnips, carrots and celery. This looks great served over white rice with a garnish of fresh chopped cilantro, parsley or unsalted peanuts.",

I served it over brown rice, and I am stuffed right now from eating an extra helping because it was so darn good! This is one of the best allrecipes.com recipe I have ever made.",

I put it together just slightly differently. I sauteed carrots celery and onions with sweet potatoes. I eye-balled the peanut butter and tasted as I put it in. I also used homemade chicken stock instead of water. The other reviewers complained that it was spicy yet bland so I dredged the boneless thighs I used in a mixture of flour cumin ground corriander salt & pepper before cooking in a little olive oil. I did also let this sit for a day before serving. Easy and delicious. Just the way I like it! Thanks so much for the post!",
