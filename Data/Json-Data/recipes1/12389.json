Add a dash of black pepper and you're good to go!  Yum!",

I doubled the recipe, added a couple diced redskinned potatoes, and dumped considerably more curry in it because we like things savory. Really, really good. \n\nMake sure to soak those yellow split peas either overnight, or boil them a couple minutes in six cups of water and let them sit for a couple hours. They take a really long time to soften up otherwise, and it's difficult to keep the rest of the soup from scorching.",
