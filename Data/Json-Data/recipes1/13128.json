Instead of canned chicken I used a couple of boneless skinless chicken breast that I fried up first and then chopped finely. I also added finely chopped ginger garlic red pepper pineapple and coriander which gave it more of a Thai feel. I also added some pineapple juice and soy sauce and just a dash of thai sweet chili sauce. I couldn't find biscuit dough so I used Pillsbury crescent rolls (cut in half) and formed them into little bundles by pinching together the dough at the top. I made them last night for a party and they were a huge hit!",
