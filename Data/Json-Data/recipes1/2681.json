When I tried as directed I got very little crust--it was more like floured margarine. I added another 1/2 to 3/4 cup flour to make it workable. Then it came together easily. Although I probably could have refrigerated it I chose to just roll it out...which it was a tad difficult to work with but not impossible. With added flour this seemed to work out okay but I'm still puzzled by the recipe. It is a tad salty--if you use salted margarine you probably don't need the salt at all. This worked for what I wanted it for and I figured this recipe deserved another chance but I had to make enough changes that I think it wouldn't really work as written. Thanks for the recipe!",
