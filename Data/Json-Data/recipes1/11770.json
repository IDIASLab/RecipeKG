I will make this agagin and again. Just make sure you use spagetti or a thicker noodle I used angel hair and it turn out to be a clumpy mess. I also taught my kids 10 14 how to make this it's just as easy as the box kind but better for them....",

To avoid the lumpiness in the cheese sauce that someone mentioned I made the sauce separately and then added it to the spaghetti when both were done. I did make a few alterations... I used grated cheddar instead of American cheese. Because the cheese itself is a bit oily I'll cut down a little on the margarine next time (I also used margarine instead of butter). I also used soy milk instead of regular milk. And I mixed in the garlic powder and black pepper instead of using it on top just before the dish is served. Sooooo good!
