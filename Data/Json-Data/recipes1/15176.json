My suggestions to avoid soggy wings (1) Make sure to dry wings before flour dredge, (2) \"Rest\" wings uncovered in fridge for longer time (3) Line baking sheet or broiler pan with aluminum foil and place cooling rack or equivalent on lined pan, then bake wings on the rack. The grease will drip down into the pan and the wings will cook without soaking in the grease. This is an excellent alternative to fried wings, and being from the Buffalo area, I can say with confidence that these are comparable to those served in this area. Well done!",

Here is what you need to do in order to feel like I do, post-meal:  \nPut paper towels down and dry/squeeze your raw wings.  Dredge them in the flour mixture, leave them in the fridge for 45 min-1 hr.  You DO NOT need to leave them in for longer/overnight...I promise. Place them on a cooling rack or a griddle pan (I took my \"racks\" from my panini press).  Do not dip in the hot sauce mixture and bake wings at 425F for 25 minutes one one side, and then flip for 25 another minutes.  Take them out, dredge them in the sauce mixture (I turned mine twice) and then put them back in the hot oven, under the broiler on low for 5 minutes on each side. If you want to wipe down your pan with paper towels so you're not putting them back into the grease, do it!  I promise they will be amazing!  Re: sauce.  Taste it before you dredge! If you like it hotter, with soy sauce, more garlic and salt, add it! This recipe is great with these additions.  Took longer, but WELL worth it.",

Right before baking I dipped in the butter/hot sauce and placed on a wire rack to cook.  Baked these the required 45 minutes and they were, soggy, soggy, soggy with not much flavor.  Pulled them out of the oven and re-dipped in straight hot sauce and then baked an additional 30 minutes with the last 20 minutes at 450 and they FINALLY started crisping.  Once they crisped, they were delicious.  3 stars based on the soggy factor and modification of the recipe to make it \"work\".  4 stars for taste with the re-dipping!",

If your wings didn't end up with crispy skin or came out soggy it may have to do with the wings aren't dry enough. My suggestion is to dry your wings on a drainer after rising. Then pat dry (or even squeeze a little) with paper towel. If your wings are dry enough they should coat nicely with the flour. Refrigerate without the plastic wrap can also help drying the wings. Do not soak your wings into the butter and hot sauce mixture for too long. If juice comes out during baking drain it. This should make the crispy skin. I might also try making them in different favors such as lemon pepper or honey lime etc.",

I'm not ready to say that they're the best I've ever had, but they certainly rival that of most restaurants and we were very pleased with them.  I think there are a few musts with these if you want them to be crispy: 1) pat your wings dry before coating with flour and let them sit in the fridge.  Ours sat for an hour and that was perfectly fine.  2) Don't line your pan with foil. While it might make clean-up a little easier, it does nothing to help crisp your wings.  We spread a little olive oil on a cookie sheet and spread them evenly. At about the 30 minute mark we drained any oil or juices off and then put them back in the oven.  3) Don't put the sauce on right away.  We baked ours for about 25 minutes, flipped them, baked for another 15 or so, and THEN rolled them in sauce before putting them back in for another 10 minutes or so. Our wings were crispy and delicious.  Hopes this helps some!",
