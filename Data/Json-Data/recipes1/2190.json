I'm not a big fan of sourdough so I like these because they are not very sour and no fussing with a starter! They are so easy to make and the texture is wonderful - very light and fluffy. The dough IS sticky but just put a lot of flour down to knead it. It's great that you can keep the dough on hand in the fridge for fresh bread when you want it!",

I halved the recipe and I mixed the yeast water and sugar togeather then cut in the butter and soda salt and powder. Then I added the two and a half cups of flower and added buttermilk until the dough became doughy. It kneeded well and I let it rise for an hour before rolling it out and making biscuits. The end result was airy and light rolls that would have tasted a lot like real sourdough biscuits IF the sugar content had been less. I will make this recipe again and I encourage others to try as well.",

I tried to make it in the food processor, like I do with my other biscuit recipe, and I cannot stress enough what a BAD idea that was. This recipe makes more of a batter than a dough. I turned it out onto the counter to knead it...don't do it. Just a sticky gluey mess. I scraped it into a bowl and spooned it into a muffin tin. It took about 25 minutes to bake, and was  more like a muffin than a biscuit. It was a tasty muffin, but not a biscuit like texture at all. I think if I made it again in the future (not a given) that I would mix it with the standing mixer and add probably another cup and a half to 2 cups of flour, or cut the buttermilk back by half. My son liked it.",
