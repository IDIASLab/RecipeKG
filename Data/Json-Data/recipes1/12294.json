I doubled the oregano used a full teaspoon of sugar minced two garlic cloves substituted 1/2 tsp. garlic powder for the garlic salt used 1/4 tsp. dried parsley rather than fresh (didn't have fresh on hand) and added about 1/4 cup (drained) diced tomatoes. The flavor wasn't quite right once mixed so I put it in the microwave on medium heat for three minutes stirred and then let cool slightly. I served this as the dipping sauce for \"Real Italian Calzones\" also featured at allrecipes.com. Both were delicious!",
