I made this just now but made some change due to no goats milk and cardamon, I made the tea as directed but added a pkt of Splenda and sugar-free Vanilla caramel coffemate(aout a Tbls) and a splash of milk. Its delicous and low cal and low fat. I would think that the cardamon would add a little more chai flavor so next time I will add it. Im enjoying this variation very much.

I wouldn't even know where to get that. I knew I could subtitute another dairy milk product no problem. I ended up using half and half because that is what I had in the house. I liked that it used chai tea bags instead of the longer process of simmering different spices. They were actually really affordable. I found it at Whole Foods for about 3 dollars a box. I microwaved the water for 1 minute then followed through with the rest of the recipe. I topped it with whipped cream and sprinkled it with nutmeg. I read on-line that nutmeg was an acceptable subtitute for cardamon which can be pricey and hard to find. I am going to try this again with fat free half and half and a packet of Truvia. I am sure it will not be as good but it will be guilt free.",

For one this beverage lacks the light foam that adds a little body and sits at the top. Secondly the recipe mainly relies on the tea bag to produce spicy aroma and taste of chai; even if I had had the cardamom it wouldn't be enough to give it the signature flavour. I'm wondering if goat's milk is denser than cow's milk... I think if additional \"chai spices\" were infused in the dairy part of the beverage and frothed before adding to the water and tea bag this would be fantastic. This could potentially be good using a thick coconut milk too. Hmm... Will try this again with tweaks to achieve the latte I have in mind but I'll settle for this as a standard for drinking chai without being a latte (in doing so I'd use 1/2 an ounce of milk).",
