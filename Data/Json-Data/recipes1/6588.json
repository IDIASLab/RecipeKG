I eased up on the buttermilk only because I wanted a thicker dipping sauce for the wings. What's left I'll thin out with more buttermilk for salad dressing. I eased up on the Worcestershire using only half the amount called for and chose fresh parsley and garlic over the dried parsley and garlic powder tho' I don't think it's a big deal one way or the other. Bottom line is I loved this stuff. (No comment from Hubs who'd rather have a root canal than eat Blue cheese)",
