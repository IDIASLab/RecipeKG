This crust reminds me of a good bread pudding, the edges have just a little crunch and the center is soft and custard like.  If that is the kind of cobbler you preffer, then this is the best recipe.\n\nI did make a couple of changes.  I added a 1/4 cup more flour and milk to make more crust, and I used a smaller/deeper baking dish.  I had to adjust the cooking time/temp a little for best results.  350-375 for 30 minutes then bump the temp to 400 for 10 minutes.  Be sure to keep an eye on it in the last 10 minutes since.  Everything was set perfectly for me at the 10 minute mark, but we all know there are a great number of factors that affect cook time.\n\nAnyways, I'll be playing with this recipe some more, so if I come up with some bit thing that makes a significant change, I might be back.",

I made this cobbler with two minor changes. I prepared this with about 6 large fresh peaches sliced thinly instead of canned peaches. Also, after it had been in the oven for about 5 minutes and had started to \"set\", I sprinkled the top with about 2 Tbl sugar and then continued to bake it. I imagine I will prepare this cobbler many many more times because it really was very easy and very delicious.",

I used dark brown sugar (lightly packed), butter instead of margarine, half 'n' half instead of milk, and added a bit of cinnamon to the batter.  I also used Margaret Holmes O'sage Ragged Freestone Peach halves and pieces, chopped up a bit. (which, in my opinion, makes a difference).  My cobbler was neither bland nor dry.  This is an absolute MUST TRY recipe!!  My mouth is watering thinking about it... To make it easier, I save my version as a custom recipe if anyone is interested.",

The first time I made this I followed it exact and baked it in a 9x13 pan and my family devored it before I had a chance to get a little bite! I found it to be a bit mushy like and I did bake it longer than what the recipe called for. BUT I found it very yummy!! The next day we were invited over for dinner with the parents and I was to make dessert. My husband said I had to make this for dessert so off to the store I went to buy more canned peaches. This time I decided to double the entire recipe becuase we had a bunch to feed and I added a 1/2 cup more flour and a little nutmeg with the cinnamon. I had to bake it in a 9x13 which was perfect to use and baked it for about 50-55 minutes since the recipe was doubled. It turned out better than the first try just following the recipe as was. I really liked the recipe as is and I don't rate unless I find it to be five stars and before I made it a second time my rating was five stars!! I WILL make this again!! If you want the cake part to be more cakier than add a little more flour. I thought it was fabulous doubled so there you are!! I am usually a bisquit-y cobbler person but this was wonderful!! Thank you!!",
