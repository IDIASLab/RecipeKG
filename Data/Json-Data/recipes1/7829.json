(You could also halve the recipe). I have found that the half portion is sufficient for any party. I modified the recipe a bit using 1 cup Mexican blend cheese and skipping the pepper jack (didn't have it on hand). I also skipped the jalapenos but added bacon and green onions. I doubled the Worcestershire sauce and rolled the cheeseball in the shredded cheese as the author suggested. The green peppers add great color and crunch. I highly recommend this recipe it's easy and different. Thanks Anita!",
