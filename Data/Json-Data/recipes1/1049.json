Here's a piece of advice for the people who are having problems with the recipe. 1) Pay attention to your crust. Everyone's oven is different, and what works in one may not work in another. 2) TASTE the filling part!Not a spoonful, just a fingerfull before you pour it in. If it's too sweet, you'll know before you waste an entire batch. My roots are in the south, so I like them sweet :o) If you don't, though, try this and you may save yourself some heartache!",

I think the secret is to spread it with an angled cake frosting knife. I've also made this with GourmetMommy's suggestions (most helpful ratings) and really hated it (sorry) - WAY too sour - guess I'm a Southerner at heart and like the sweeter version? Last night for our potluck I made it as directed except used the Shortbread Crust recipe (on this site submitted by Angela) someone had suggested and doubled the original filling (had to cook a bit longer). It was yummy but very gooey and I like them a bit crunchier for lack of a better word. Totally LOVED the shortbread crust (you must try it this way) and the bars were gone within the first five minutes. For anyone out there - turn your oven down to 350 as all have said and watch it! My crust baked perfectly but some ovens are hotter. Just keep an eye on it until it's golden brown - about every 7-8 minutes.",
