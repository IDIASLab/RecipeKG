You have to work fairly fast while frosting your cake as it starts to set up (crust) a bit, so be sure to smooth the sides and top the way you want them because you can't really go back and do it again after a few short minutes like you can with buttercream. It was a nice light frosting and was wonderful with the deep chocolate cake, although it could be a little less sweet. Next time I will try to add a bit less sugar and see what happens.  Also, I did not have graininess the next day as some other recipes of this type have suggested. All in all this one is a keeper. Thank you!",

The advice given on those is...don't let the boiling water touch the bottom of the pot in which you are mixing the frosting. Keep the water to a low simmer so that the water doesn't touch the top pot. If it touches, the frosting gets grainy. Hope this helps! I simmered the water and it turned out great.",

This will make sure that your sugar is fully dissolved. After the sugar has dissolved then use the HAND MIXER and whisk at full speed for about 3-4mins. I took my bowl off the boiler after that and continued whisking until you get that nice frothy consistency and lastly add the vanilla essence. Hope that helps!",
