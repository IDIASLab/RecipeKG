At first I baked it just like how it said, substituting a box of mac and cheese for the separate ingredients. But when it was finished I found it rather sweet, bland and unappetizing.  So I added a can of chicken, a couple tablespoons chopped olives, 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar, 3 tablespoons cream cheese, a lot of salt, a good amount of hot sauce, some italian seasoning, onion powder, and cumin.  And parsley :o)  My boyfriend and I both thought it was excellent and I loved how easy and not dirty dishes making it was, next time I'm going to try draining the corn and adding the same amount of milk as well as my other additions, and put a couple porkchops underneath so it will truly be a one dish meal!  Thank you so much for this base recipe!",
