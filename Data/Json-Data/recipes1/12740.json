I used beef polish sausage and fried it sans the vegetable oil (it has it's own fat to fry in) 3. I then added to the sausage 1 clove of garlic small onion (chopped finely) small amt. of pepper for taste parsley pinch of crushed red pepper and cooked for 5min. I then added 1 jar of spaghetti sauce plus 1 4oz can tomato sauce and brought to a slight boil...at which time I added 10 small frozen meatballs. Simmered for 15min stirring often. Cut the meatballs in half and mixed with pasta in 8 by 11 glass. I added a dusting of italian style breadcrumbs a sprinkling of cheese and topped with italian pepperoni. Cooked uncovered for 25 min checking often to ensure that it did not dry out. There were no leftovers and that is saying something in this family. This is an excellent starter recipe. Tweak it to your liking!",
