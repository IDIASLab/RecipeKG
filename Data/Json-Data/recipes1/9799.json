There is significant prep involved but I now use a mini-chopper which helps cut donwn on the chopping time. I do use a little less cornbread than what it calls for to make the cornbread layers a little thinner. I think this is an adaptable recipe -- I've used red peppers if I don't have enough green green onions if I don't have enough regular onions. The only non-negotiables are the sweet pickles and the bacon. This is a standard in my repetoire now!",
