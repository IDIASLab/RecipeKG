When the wings are deep fried they lose any sort of flavor they were marinated in. I did throw a couple in the oven to bake after I didn't like them fried and those were good. I'd like to throw them on the grill too. I'm sure they'd be good that way as well. Fried just doesn't work with this recipie all the good bits of onion garlic and ginger fall off when stuck in a pot of oil.",

When I saw this recipe I thought I'd give it a shot. WoW!! It was very close. I did make some changes. I used chicken breasts and I marinated them 4 hours. Instead of deep frying them I first cut them into bite size pieces and then sauteed them in about 1/2 cup of veg. oil. After they were close to done I drained the oil and added the marinade some water chestnuts and some rather large slices of onion (that is how it is done at the buffet). I thicked the sauce with Wondra. I will use this recipe again and again. Thanks!",

They are still good - but I think they could be great if they were cooked differently. Thanks!",
