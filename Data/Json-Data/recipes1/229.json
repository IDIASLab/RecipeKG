There is a LOT of sugar here, and that carmelizes when it bakes, so if you overbake these they become hard as a rock when that sugar solidifies on cool down. Watch carefully, and these may seem a little raw when you pull them from the oven. Walnuts ruin these, IMO. Skip those and use shredded coconut instead. Even if you don't like the flavor... it bulks these up and helps retain the moisture and keep these chewy. YUM!",

I'm hovering between a 3 and a 4. 4 because I'd just got home from vacation had very little baking ingredients and wanted a dessert for dinner and these fitted the bill perfectly. 3 because I was disappointed with how thin they were. I used the right size pan and followed the directions exactly but it could have been something I did. Finally I've decided on a 4 because they tasted good and had a great chewy texture. I will make these again but double the mixture and cook them longer. Thankyou.",
