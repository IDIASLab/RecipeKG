Prior reviewers have scoped things out very well: 1) cut milk by half or at least a quarter or alternatively, increase the flour to thicken, 2) reduce Old Bay seasoning to 1 1/2 tablespoons or so; two tablespoons are okay, but getting close to being \"too much.\"  I used diced tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.  I used regular onion because I didn't have any green onion.  I left the melts under the broiler for two or three minutes for a golden brown appearance on the cheese (instead of 30 seconds to one minute).  Watch the melts closely though.  Food that close to the element can burn easily, of course.  I used provolone on most of the melts, but tried pepper jack cheese on three of them and it was excellent too.  For something a little different and definitely worth the trouble, give this one a shot!",

                "reviewBody": "I'm giving this a 4 because the end product came out very well.  But I think there are some adjustments that need to be made on the ingredients.  First of all, there is way too much milk.  I used a little more flour than called for (added an extra pinch or two) and only used HALF the milk called for..and probably should have used a little less milk.  I would say add the milk in batches and stir, and stop before it gets too soupy.  I used frozen shrimp that was about 3/4 defrosted, so I may have had A LITTLE more liquid than normal, but it is just too much milk.  Even with only using 1/2 the milk mine was still boardering on \"soupy\".\r\n\r\nThe other adjustment I would make is the Old Bay amount.  I love Old Bay, and I like things salty and spicy, BUT, the full amount (which I added) was on the boarder of me enjoying it (which I did).  If it were any saltier I would have probably eaten it, but though \"god this is salty\" with every bite.  The finished product also tastes distinctly of Old Bay, so if you aren't a fan, this is not the recipe for you!  And don't salt your tomato before you broil it!\r\n\r\nI would also like more celery and green onion, and used Swiss intead of Provolone, but that is just personal taste.  Ended up tasting very good, just watch the milk and the Old Bay.  :-)",
