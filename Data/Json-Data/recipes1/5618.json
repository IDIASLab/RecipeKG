Also, I measured all ingredients precisely and I found that there was not sufficient flour to thicken into a gravy.  I added a small flour and water mixture just before adding the veggies so that I had the right consistency. (This is no problem for me as I'm more of a 'throw it all in without measuring' kind of cook anyway, which was is just what I did after the first preparation)  I found that it took me longer than the estimated times, but maybe the estimate assumes vegetables chopped, ingredients measured and waiting, etc.  Also, instead of fish stock, I just took the shells from the shrimp I was already using and made shrimp stock and used that.  Maybe it's better with the fish stock but I thought this was delicious and time-saving for me.  Give it a try!",
