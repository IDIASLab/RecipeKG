First, before you fry anything, make sure your oil has a high smoke point (peanut or canola) so it doesn't burn too quickly.  Second, heat your oil plenty hot, because if it is too cold, your food will be heavy and greasy.  A bit of batter should float and sizzle in there at the right temperature without burning up.  Third, wash and pat your food dry and dust it with some dry pancake mix before dredging it in the wet batter to make it stick well.  Fourth, use the best beer you can afford and two tablespoons of a salty seasoning like cajun or Old Bay for flavor.  Fifth, don't crowd your food, fry in multiple batches if necessary, and fry in hot oil until the food floats to the top and stays there.",

My version was a 5 for us....I gave the version \"as is\" a 4 because it is a bit bland and I did make some minor changes. I added 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 TB of lemon juice....I do the same thing to the pancake batter at home for pancakes because it makes it lighter/fluffier...just a personal preferance.....so since I make my pancakes that way I did the same with a pancake based recipe. The thing that was more of an issue is this batter is a great base but totally lacks seasoning. I added 1/4 tsp each of salt pepper paprika garlic and Cajun seasoning. To the person that it came out oily: sounds like your oil was not hot enough.",

Plus my grocer did not have trout. SO I purchased an arrange for fish selections to try & see what worked & tasted best with what was offered.. I purchased Cod Tilapia Perch & Flounder filets. Each had done rather well but there were some drawbacks.. While they were all good with the batter. The longer the batter sits as your dipping and frying the less the batter tends to be nice and thick. The Cod was the 1st to dunk into the batter & it puffed and golden really well & was a favorite. Totally delish but the batter in the beginning has a slight sweetness to. But with the rest of the fish that disappeared. Note: did use buttermilk brand. The perch had the skin on & that made my fish curl in the frying process & batter wasn't thick but rather thin. The Tilapia I cut down the center & fried. It was also a favorite the batter on the Tilapia was really nice & stayed well coated. The Flounder was delish as well & did the same thing as the Perch. It thinned. But as I realize in the process. The reason is because Perch & Flounder are moister & holds more liquids there for the water was sweating out threw the batter making it thinner. But it still worked. Using the cod & tilapia was quite nice. This is a quick and easy recipe. Will make again. I used wheat beer will try a malt one next time.",
