The only things I would suggest are 1. buying Hunt's tomatoes - don't substitute with a generic brand. 2. draining the tomatoes, unless you like a really runny salsa. 3. only blending on pulse a few times - I'm talking seconds. The first batch I made was very runny, but the second one was AMAZING, and I got so many compliments on it!! :) Thanks!",

I didn't change a thing and it was mild and flavorful. When you originally chop your onions, leave them a little on the big side, that way when you blend them, they won't be puried and be overpowering. Also, don't over blend the salsa. After reading reviews, it seems some have complained about the consistency, that it's too runny. I didn't drain my tomatoes, but only pulsed my blender a few times. The consistency was perfect. I've eaten chips and salsa for lunch 2 days in a row now. I'm addicted and will make this regularly. Thanks so much!",

Instead of green chiles I opted to used 1 Tbsp. of jalepeno as that's what I had on hand. I added 2 tsp. of apple cider vinegar, 2 tsp. of minced garlic from the jar, and 1/2 tsp. of sugar. I put this into my mini food processor and let it go.... I put it in the fridge for a couple of hours to let the flavors blend and this is now my \"go to\" salsa recipe.
