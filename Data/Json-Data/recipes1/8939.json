Also if you mix some powdered sugar and cream sherry together (to desired consistency) poke holes in top of cake and pour mixture over top and let the mixture absorb it s wonderful. It makes the cake SO moist and delicious. It's a MUST try recipe. It doesn't look as good as it tastes!!! It melts in your mouth it's so good. You can also use apple sauce in place of the oil and its VERY moist and semi-diet friendly. YUMMY!",

I happened to have everything I needed for this including some cream sherry someone had given to us a long time ago. Well it still tasted ok so I decided to go for it! Boy am I glad I did. This makes a seriously delicious cake!! I was concerned with the amount of liquid in this recipe and after comparing it to other wine cakes I decided to cut the water by half. It baked up beautifully in 43 minutes in my oven. I also took the suggestion of another reviewer and made a glaze with some powdered sugar and cream sherry which was a nice addition. I was really impressed with this cake and will definitely make it again!",

I followed the recipe without thinking and I had to trash the cake it was disgusting. Also you don't need water if you're using oil and sherry. Just omit the water and you'll probably be okay. The correct amount should be around 3/4 c sherry and 2/3 c oil and no water. If you want to make this non-alcoholic substitute water for sherry in equal amounts you can hardly tell the difference especially if your nutmeg is good and fresh.",
