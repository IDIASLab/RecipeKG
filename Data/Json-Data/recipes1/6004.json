I added some red pepper flakes, we like it hot, and could have used more.  Also consider using a jalepano.  If you double the turkey, be sure to add more onion, tomato sauce (or one 6oz can tomato paste with a full can of water,) bbq sauce, corn and green bell pepper.  I used whole wheat pasta and couldn't even tell.  It was excellent!  My fiance had 3 servings, and there was leftovers!",

I cooked the pasta the night before and defrosted a 10 oz package of corn to save time. In the morning I browned the turkey with onion minced garlic and garlic powder to give it more flavor. I added cumin for smokiness and crushed red pepper flakes for a little kick. I saved about a cup of the starchy pasta water to bind the sauce together instead of using bland tomato sauce. I used a can of diced tomatoes with oregano garlic and basil for more flavor. I had a bag of frozen peppers and onions in the fridge so I put them in the processor to chop them and added a half cup of them to the hot tub. It turned out really tasty and really fast in less than 20 minutes I was done. So figure friendly and lower in fat sodium and cholesterol than old school hamburger helper. Thanks Dimple2000 for the recipe.",
