Although the description mentioned walnuts, they were not listed in the ingredients section nor the directions section, so you may want to write them in when you print out the recipe. To save time, you could substitute bottled Raspberry Vinaigrette dressing for the dressing listed here.  They don't taste exactly the same, but close enough and certainly a time-saver for busy cooks.  Very attractive salad!",

I use a mix of sesame and olive oil, and regular vinegar if you are in a rush.  Bleu Cheese is not very kid friendly, but I do serve with Carmelized walnuts.
