If you're not looking for a strong lemon flavor, you're going to want to go easier on the lemon. \r\n\r\nYou also don't need to cream the butter and sugar for 20 minutes. I used a hand mixer on a medium setting for less than 5 minutes. I can only assume Eleanor mixes by hand to warrant 20 minutes. Even then, it seems excessive. Just make sure it's completely blended (aka there is no sugar that bears a striking resemblance to instant potato flakes).\r\n\r\nIt does look like it makes too much batter for one Bundt, I ended up reserving some. Don't. The cake didn't rise enough to warrant my fear.\r\n\r\nMy only real complaint with the cake is that it really needs a glaze or frosting to really make it pop. There are a couple of glazes suggested by other reviewers, be sure to have the ingredients handy as this isn't really a stand alone cake.",

If you have any hesitation about making this at all, just do it!!!...Its the best, it really does melt in your mouth!.We have company coming for dinner next week and Im going to make it again so that everyone will have their own mini bundt cake, and that way I dont have to share mine!!! ...LOL",

There's just something about it that makes it a very special cake.\n\nA few tips: Please cream your butter for a few minutes first on high speed. Then cream the butter and sugar together for 15-20 minutes...knowledgeable cooks know that this makes ALL the difference. Beat for one minute after adding each egg, on a high speed. The egg mixture should be incredibly fluffy. I then add THREE tsp. of vanilla extract, then beat in my flour and 7-UP in stages (one cup of flour, then 2 oz. of 7-UP). Beat for one minute after each 7-UP addition. Finally, add THREE tsp. of lemon extract, and beat it all together. Also, it is very easy to overbake the cake, so start checking it at 50 minutes. 75 minutes is usually way too much. Finally, you can add up to 8 oz. of 7-UP--just play around with the amount that suits your taste. Seven-Up cake is time consuming, but oh so worth it for special occasions!",

I tasted some of the batter and it was grainy and then I really started to worry. The recipe calls for you to cream the butter and sugar for 20 minutes and I did not do so. I started to second guess myself about my decision to cream the butter and sugar for only 5 min instead of the 20 minutes or even the 10 minutes as most reviewers did.  But not to worry,  I put a lemon glaze icing on the cake while it was hot and the cake was WONDERFUL.  This was a relief to have such a wonderful cake and it was so easy to make.  I have to make this cake again next week for a friend,  so I said,  I will at least cream the butter and sugar for 10 minutes just to see if it makes a difference but honestly,  I don't think it will.  I just don't think the cake can get any better but if it does then I will definitely be surprised and the winner. I made this cake for a Saturday event and there was no cake left, so I guess all of our guests felt as I do that this was a wonderful cake. I received many compliments on this cake.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.",
