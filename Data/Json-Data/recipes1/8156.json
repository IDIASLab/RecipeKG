Another thing I loved about this recipe is that you don't have to bake anything! Why make the house hotter than it already is? Thanks.",

Even by the next day it was still quite runny. I put it in the freezer but it didn't taste good frozen and then once it defrosted in the fridge it just went back to being runny again.
