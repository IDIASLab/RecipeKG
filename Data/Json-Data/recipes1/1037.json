A suggestion for those whose shapes did not stay...break the dough up into small sections.  Keep the rest of the dough in the fridge until ready to use. Also, while other cookies were baking, I put the unused tray in the fridge to cool off quickly. I learned that if the tray is too hot, it will begin to distort the shape of your cookies even before you put them in the oven. Try it. It really helps to keep the shape.",

You can't expect amazing cookies unless you're willing to go the extra mile and try one of the other sugar cookie recipes that have 15 different ingredients in them. I picked these cookies because it's a very simple recipe and I had all the ingredients on hand. The only thing I didn't like too much was that the dough was really thick and I had a hard time working with it. Because of the other reviews I didn't roll out the dough or cut shapes. I just dropped them and they came out perfectly shaped. Crispy on the outside with a soft chewey inside. Overall these were good cookies. Perfect for the house but if I needed a batch to impress I would try one of the more elaborate recipes on this site.",
