Sometimes I add a little candied orange or lemon peel and a few golden raisins soaked overnight in a little brandy: this is a great variation. Spices may be varied to suit individual tastes. This one is sure to please anyone who loves marmalade. Delicious with teas such as Constant Comment or Russian Caravan.",

I started the cake out at 350 and within a half an hour noticed that the edges were browning too much. So I reduced the temp. I would like to add that I made this batter per the recipe and this cake can be quite dry! I had leftover Orange Marmalade from my Christmas gift giving and thought this would be a great recipe to try. Not as sweet as I thought it would be but if you do attempt this one a simple syrup poured over the cake could make it a bit less dry. Won't make again.",

The texture on this cake is very much like a traditional banana bread and it is very moist (I made sure not to overcook it). There is next to no orange flavor (and I even added the zest from one orange) except when you bite into a piece of the orange rind from the marmalade. That being said I would add orange juice rather than lemon juice and maybe even a bit of orange extract. Drizzled an orange-flavored icing over the top and sprinkled with orange zest. Just needs some tweaking this is a quite good cake.",
