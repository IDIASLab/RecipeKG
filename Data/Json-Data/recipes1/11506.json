Day old French bread worked well for the stuffing, but I may use a more flavorful bread next time.  As suggested by another reviewer, I cooked on 325 degrees for 2 hours and the chops were tender as could be.  The cream of mushroom soup and milk (I used milk instead of water) makes a flavorful pork gravy that is wonderful!  We put the gravy over mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  Righteous!",

I spread the extra stuffing on the bottom of the pan and put the chops on top of it, put the soup over them, covered it with foil and baked at 325 for about 2 hours. It was awesome!",

I'm not a fan of stuffing so I made one just with the stuffing on top for myself. For the rest I butterflied the chops and stuffed them before I browned them. I sauteed the onion and used celery salt because I didn't have any celery. I used a mix of white and wheat bread and added a little of the soup to the stuffing mix. To me the chops were just a tad dry (I usually brine them before I cook them to keep them moist) but otherwise they were excellent. I will absolutely make these again soon.",
