I only added about 1 1/2 pks of the spinach, and mixed the spinach, ricotta & chicken together for easy layering.  I used fresh (refrigerated), no-boil noodles and just let them cook in the sauce.  I did add about 1/2 cup white wine to the sauce and added a lot more garlic.  I did add almost twice the amount of ricotta and added a few extra cups of mozzerella.  (There's no such thing as too much cheese in my house:) My husband and friend who came over for dinner couldn't get enough!.  Definitely elegant and interesting enough to serve at a dinner party, but great for any family dinner as well.  I was just really pleased with this meal.\r\n\r\n**Addendum 8/24/04--I just wanted to add that recently I began using fresh spinach in this recipe and it improved greatly.  I de-stemmed the spinach (about 1 lb bag) and then threw it in a pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil.  Cooked it down until it was tender and bright green.  The frozen spinach is mostly stems, so substituting fresh spinach took care of that problem",

I add a layer of sauteed veggies (onion, garlic, fresh garlic, mushrooms, matchstick carrots, and zucchini). Mine ends up going: sauce, noodles, ricotta/spinich mixture, chicken, sauce, noodles, ricotta/spinich, veggies, sauce, noodles, ricotta/spinich, chicken, sauce, cheese. It is so good!",

I made a few adjustments and have a few more that I will try next time I make it.\r\nFor the sauce I added about two teaspoons of chopped garlic from a jar and thought it was perfect.  I didn't chop my onions fine enough though.  I recommend you chop them very fine.  I only had one 10 oz can of chicken broth so I made up the rest of the two cups of broth with white wine.  I used the amount of oregano and basil called for and thought that was perfect.  But the wine may have hidden some of the taste.  I added salt and pepper at the very end based on taste.  I am not sure how much I added.\r\nThe recipe is not clear if the noodles should be precooked, so I used no bake noodles.  \r\nI baked the chicken in the oven with no spices.  The chicken itself didn't have much flavor, but you don't miss it with everything else going on.\r\nI used a 16 oz package of spinach and was still a little too much in my opinion.  Next time I will use one 10 oz package.\r\nI didn't pay attention to how the recipe said to layer, because it didn't make any sense to me.  I put a third of the sauce in the pan, a layer of noodles, half of the chicken, spinach, and ricotta.  Then another layer of noodles, 1/3 of the sauce, rest of the chicken, spinach and ricotta.  The final layer of noodles and sauce.  Then the mozzerella and parm. cheese.  \r\nBecause I made ahead of",

Next time, I will use a straight bechamel, using all milk and no chicken broth. I will probably use just parmesan cheese and skip the mozzarella, too. I think part of the reason I found this recipe so bland was that there was no nutmeg in the white sauce - for me nutmeg is a must, both for the bechamel AND for the spinach! Besides all the issues I had with the sauce, I made a couple changes to the \"structure\" of the lasagna - first putting sauce in the pan, then noodles, chicken with sauce, noodles, spinach with ricotta (I substituted cottage cheese), noodles, then the chicken mixture again, noodles, then the spinach mixture again, more noodles, finishing with plain sauce topped with more parmesan cheese. I used no-boil soft lasagna noodles throughout. I like to make lasagna on \"swim lesson night\" because I can make it ahead and have it bake and set before we get home, and my daughter doesn't like tomato-based lasagna so I will definitely make chicken and spinach lasagna again, but next time I'll do it \"my way\"...",
