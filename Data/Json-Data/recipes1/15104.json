First we subbed quinoa with Israeli Couscous, however misjudged the yield on the couscous (1&1/3 cup - Standard at Trader Joe's) will probably fill 4-6 peppers. The couscous has a little more rewarding texture than quinoa. We also cooked the couscous in vegetable stock for more flavor. Also, I couldn't find green onions tonight, so I used chives, and they seemed to work well. With the added yield of the couscous, we doubled the tomatoes and apples. and lime juice. We also left out the mint. That said, this dish was absolutely excellent. The flavors just sort of jump out and are literally mouth watering. My boyfriend says it's the sort of thing that makes him think he could be vegetarian too. Since we had so much filling, there was enough to bake and eat without the peppers - very yummy!",
