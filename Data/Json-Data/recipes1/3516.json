I began with half the butter in which I sauted 1 shallot minced and the 4 cloves of crushed garlic (fresh). I then added the 1 tbs of flour and let it cook slightly. I then added the can of soup let it thicken and then thinned it a bit with 1/4 to 1/2 chicken stock. I the chopped 2 bags of baby spinach about an inch or so thick and after the heat is off folded it gently into the sauce mixture. I did not let it cook. Placed it all in a 9X13 buttered dish - topped it with 1 cup Panko crumbs seasoned with S&P and a little Olive oil. I baked it for 15-20 min just to bring it to heat and crisp the topping. Rave reviews...Please try it with the fresh spinach and you will never go back to frozen.",

Had on hand cream of mushroom instead of celery soup. Sauted the onions in just 2 T. of butter instead of 4 omitted adding any additonal salt and used 1/2 Tsp. powdered garlic. It was scrumptous! My husband suggested trying it next time not sauting the onions for the added crunch. This man hates creamed spinached but gobbled this down and said I should definitely make it again.",

I thawed my spinach very early in the day and three times during the day I put the spinach in a paper towel and squeezed out the water. It was a great consistancy when I was ready to cook it.

I sauteed the onion in the butter first to soften them then added the flour and stirred it a bit to cook out the \"floury\" taste and then added the soup spinach and cream.
