I did roll them once while still warm but also rolled them a second time after they had cooled. This is such a necessary step that I'm amazed it didn't appear in the original recipe; otherwise your cookies have a bunch of \"bled-through\" places where the oils work through the confectioner's sugar -- most notably where your fingers touched it when rolling while warm and then placing on whatever you used for a cooling rack. Having made a double batch I stored them in a plastic one-gallon ice cream tub with a sheet of waxed paper between each layer of cookies. Before setting any cookies on each sheet of waxed paper I sprinkled more confectioner's sugar on the paper. I also sprinkled the tops of each layer of cookies before placing the next sheet of waxed paper. This seems to be helping them stay fresh as well as keeping the cookies looking just as good as they taste. I will definitely make this again; I could eat an entire batch all by myself!",
