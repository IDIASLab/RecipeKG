Just squeeze the icing close enough to the edge of the cookies (top and bottom buns) for the frosting to ooze out a bit when the 'burger' is added.  They are better if prepared the day before - the vanilla wafer gets a chance to soften a bit.  For the burger I use Keebler's Grasshopper cookies.",

Brought to my 6yr old nephew's bday party and he screamed \"Krabby Patties!\" (after Sponge Bob tv show). So they are now called Krabby Patties!! I used a brush of honey to stick the sesame seeds on the Nilla wafer \"buns\" and a little to stick all the layers together. Used yellow and red food coloring mixed with vanilla icing to make \"ketchup\" and \"cheese or mustard\" (piped in using plastic bag with corner cut off). The green colored coconut is so realistic looking as lettuce! Took advice from reviewers and used Keebler mint grasshopper cookies for the patty. So incredibly cute. Time consuming so only made 12. Kids can help make too. Thank you!!!!",
