                "reviewBody": "I prepared this dish for a Seder meal at my church on Maundy Thursday. I doubled the recipe and served 40 guests (with a chicken dish available also). Having such a large quantity of cubed meat required browning the meat in several batches. (I tried just browning in the roaster but it didn't produce anything to deglace) After placing the last batch in a 450 degree roaster I deglaced the skillet with all the marinade and then poured those juices into the roaster also. I left it on 450 degrees for the first half hour and then let it roast for 3 hours at 250 degrees. Then I.removed the meat and the juices from the roaster and placed them into more attractive serving pan. It was positively melt in your mouth DELICOUS. Every single person tried a at least a small portion (even the kids)and was delighted by the flavor and tenderness of the meat. One woman pulled me aside to say \"I do not like to eat lamb it tends to taste a bit too gamey for me. But honestly I would never have known it was lamb if you hadn't explained the menu before service.\" Others remarked at the delicous taste and inquired of the marinade ingredients. I'm not sure exactly what \"sour oranges\" are but I did find Cara Cara oranges and they seemed to do the trick though I did add a little lemon juice for good measure. There is no doubt I will make this recipe again perhaps with beef when no lamb is available.",
