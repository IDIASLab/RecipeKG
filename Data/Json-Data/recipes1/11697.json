I doubled the amount of marshmallows from 2 cups to 4 cups  and I also cut the almonds in half from 2 cups to 1 cup. When I first tried it with 2 cups of almonds, there were so much almonds that weren't being held together by the gooey part of the cookie and they just sat on top or fell off. \nThese adjustments have fixed the problem and they now hold together beautifully.\nI was also told by a friend that the chocolate graham crackers work the best and so when I went to the store, all they had were the chocolate graham cracker snack sticks which I thought was worth a try. Be warned- this was a really bad idea since they weren't wide and flat enough to be a good base for this cookie. Also, I tried using wax paper instead of the aluminum foil which also didn't fare too well. The foil with plenty of Pam really worked the best. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the melted butter and brown sugar mixture (as I had seen in another Caramel Heavenlies recipe) which made it even more delicious!",

Once out of the oven I use an icing spreader to combine the melted marshmallows with the almonds and coconut otherwise I've found they fall off the cookie.

My only tip is that spraying the foil with a non-stick spray before putting the graham crackers on helps keep everything from sticking when you try and cut them up. The syrupy mixture you put over the graham's can make a bit of a mess if you don't use the spray.",
