First, I cooked the noodles a couple of minutes less than the package calls for, so after baking they will not be overdone.  I added a can of mushrooms, and an additional can of soup (either mushroom or celery) to make it creamier and it set up fine.  I cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp. because there is salt in the potato chips and sodium in the soup.  I figure eaters can always add, but cant take away.  I also added 1 1/2 c. peas to the soup mixture at the same time as the noodles, being careful not to mash.  I used Mozerella cheese instead of American.  And the leftovers are even better!  This is a keeper.",

We use the 98% fat free soups, 2% milk, and shell macaroni  because the sauce fills in the little cup shape. If we have fresh mushrooms we add a few. Couple Tbls fresh celery adds a nice texture. One son likes extra cheese so in one corner we put more there. Use the recipe as the base, add what you like, you can't go wrong.",

Instead of American cheese, I used 8 oz of shredded Sharp cheddar, I used reduced calorie cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom (my husband hates mushrooms) and I cut the salt in half. To be honest, you could probably get rid of the salt entirely since tuna and cheese are both pretty salty. My boyfriend does not normally eat or enjoy \"comfort food\" LOVED this recipe.

I decided to make it exactly as written the first time and make any changes I thought it needed next, except I did use 6 slices of cheese instead of 4.  It is so perfect the way it is I would not change a thing!  I also used the 98% fat free soup. My hubby can be very picky and he had two huge servings, I couldn't stop eating it and my 2-year-old loved it too.  And it was so easy to make and impossible to mess up.  It will definitely be part of our regular rotation.  Thanks Chris, for posting this delicious, easy and inexpensive recipe!***UPDATE***When I re-heated the leftovers(and there were a lot), the potato chips got soggy.  Now I only top 1/2 with chips and add fresh ones before re-heating leftovers.",

I used 1 can cream of mushroom 2 cans cream of chicken and 2 cups milk since many said it was dry. I used whole wheat egg noodles instead of shells and cooked them for 5 minutes so they were a little under done. I added 1 bag of frozen broccoli florets (peas would be great also!) to the last 2 minutes of the pasta cooking so they would thaw quickly. I added 1 4oz can of mushrooms 2 ribs of celery finely chopped the tops of 3 green onions 1 tsp of white pepper and garlic powder and no salt. I used 8 slices of American cheese. Instead of using chips I used the same amount of crushed croutons which I microwaved with 1 pat of butter to coat before I put them on the casserole. I only cooked it for 20 minutes then shut off the oven and left it for 10 more. It turned out wonderfully! Usually tuna casserole will come out dry (or mushy) if you overcook the noodles or add too many extra things without adding extra liquid.",
