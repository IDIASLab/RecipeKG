It can be considered a type of white pizza, as no tomatoes are used. The dough is usually a bread dough thicker than that of the classic Italian pizza traditional topping consists of caramelized (almost pureed) onions, olives, garlic and anchovies. No cheese is used in France, however, in the nearby Italian town of San Remo, mozzarella is added.",

                "reviewBody": "I have never had pissaladiere before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I thought it was a really unique flavor combination. It is not at all like what I consider as a pizza, but more of a savory tart. The crust itself is actually a pie crust rather than a pizza crust--so I'd say to not go into making this thinking that it will be very pizza-like. With that said, I did find this pissaladiere be to quite salty. I think I would omit salt from the onions and use less anchovies next time. The one issue I had with it is that the onions took 35 minutes (instead of the suggested 10) to evaporate their liquid and begin to brown--and they got very brown after baking again too (no complaints about the browning, though--just the cooking time). I think I would try adding some sugar to the onions to help offset some of the saltiness, and to aid in the caramelization. Overall, I enjoyed trying something very different--and I will be using this crust recipe in particular again! It's fantastic! Thanks for the recipe!",
