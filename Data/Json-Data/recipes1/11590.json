The other 2 added enough liquid besides the ketchup bbq sauce and Worcestershire sauce. I also substituted yellow prepared mustard for the mustard powder and added 5 weiners sliced (about a 1/2 a pound) after I lightly browned the sausage just a bit then finished browning the sausage. I baked the bean mixture for exactly 50 minutes (uncovered). I will definitely make this dish again. After all I have plenty of already seasoned ground pork sausage in the freezer to use up. This is a great side dish to serve at any potluck or famliy function. Thank you Maybelle Miller for posting this recipe. It's definitely a keeper!!",
