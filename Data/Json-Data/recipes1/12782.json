I rubbed a little vegetable oil over the chicken before sprinkling with the spice rub and let it \"marinate\" in the refrigerator overnight. Then sprinkled with the worcestershire sauce before baking.  For a nice variation try equal amounts of paprika, cumin, turmeric, garlic and brown sugar. I covered the baking dish with foil and baked about 50 mins covered and 10 minutes uncovered. Used chicken breasts the first time and thighs the next. Both were delicious - moist and flavorful.",

Using a meat thermometer to test for doneness 4 large breasts were easily cooked in about an hour. I then brushed them with BBQ sauce and let them bake a few minutes more. This recipe allows you to prepare these without standing over the grill. An added bonuse for me was avoiding the blackened and burnt BBQ sauce that happens easily when I am trying to grill chicken and do other meal prep work.",
