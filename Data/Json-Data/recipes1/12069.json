I made it this past weekend.  He loved it.  Instead of using the sharp cheddar, I used medium cheddar.  I also added 1/4c red bell peppers, 1/4c green bell peppers, and 1/4c onions, and 1/4c mushrooms.  Also after I serve this onto a plate, I grate some fresh parmesean cheese to give it a little kick.  The peppers added such a wonderful flavor to this dish.  This is going to be a favorite for a long time.  Enjoy.  Thank you Melissa!",

I did cover loosely with foil after about 20 minutes when it looked like the edges were browning too early, but next time I'm just going to let it go.  I didn't think a cup of ham would be enough or that this would actually serve 12, but it was just right.  I used diced hash browns instead of the shreds, and shredded parmesan from a bag instead of the shaker can.  Next time I might throw in some chopped jalapenos or green chiles for more zip -- bacon crumbles would be good too -- and the earlier reviewer's breakfast burrito idea for leftovers also sounds fabulous!  This was super-easy to make up the night before.  Thanks!",

To the reviewer whose results were soupy, I wonder if you might have used ready to serve, rather than condensed soup. Thanks for sharing this recipe! \nThis is an addition to my original review. I recently made this again, I omitted the Parmesan cheese, instead topping it with an additional handful of cheddar. This eliminated the salt problem! Wonderful stuff, try it you will be pleased!",
