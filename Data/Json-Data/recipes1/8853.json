While they were cooking I started the onion (in 3T. olive oil) in a separate skillet. To the onion I added sliced fresh mushrooms and some frozen peas. When the veggies were heated I added 3 T. curry some hot pepper flakes 2 C. chicken broth and 1/2 C. unsweetened coconut milk. Finally I stirred in the cooked chicken strips and let the whole thing cook for an additional 15 min. to reduce the broth. Served this over Texmati rice to my family of 4 and everyone really loved it! The 3 T. of curry powder seemed like plenty to us but that's personal perference. This recipe would get 5 stars except that it had to be tweaked quite a bit.",
