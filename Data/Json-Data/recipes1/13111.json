This was FANTASTIC...I noticed the last two people rated this with ONE star and they must be crazy or not experienced with baking. I bake almost every day...for the past 10 years and this is BY FAR the best pound cake recipe I have found yet. It is moist, tasty fluffy and flavourful....I think I baked it in less time, but I prefer things baked with a lower temp and less time...just a personal preference. I took it out as soon as the center seemed remotely cooked and left it on the counter for about an hour before attempting cutting it. It was soooo good. My hubby and kids ate a whole one that night and my hubby took another to work the next day and got rave reviews from it. This is the only pound cake I have made since finding this recipe and it will of course be the last...we have found a winner!!! SOOO tasty and moist. I have made this recipe as is about 25 times and a few times I made it with berries or apples or just with cinnamon. Its sooo good the way the recipe intended, but also good once in awhile with berries. Thanks soooooo so much for posting this recipe. Its definately a keeper.",

I used this as a base for petits fours, and the texture stood up to repeated cuts (I halved the recipe, and baked in a 9\"X13\" pan, then cut 7X10 into (70) 1-1/4\" squares) and didn't shed crumbs, neither when it was cut, nor when the fondant was poured over it. I did, however, add more milk. This was so short on liquid that the result was closer to a dough than a batter. I added 50% more milk, and added extracts (combo of almond, vanilla, orange, lemon , maple and coconut) as I needed the cake to have sufficiently assertive and complex flavor to stand up to the uber sweet fondant. The 9\"X13\" was done in 27 minutes. I cooled it in the pan for about 13 minutes, and it released beautifully onto the rack to finish. This cake is appropriately dense, sturdy and velvety moist (with additional liquid.) It's a 4-1/2 star recipe as is, but a 5 with additional milk and flavoring, which yields distinct sensory improvement.",

I dont understand the one star ratings this recipe is getting. you absolutely MUST beat the softened butter and sugar for more then five minutes with a good mixer. more like ten minutes. beat that mix like it owes you money. add the eggs one at a time. add your flavorings before the flour. remembering to subtract that liquid amount from the milk amount. add the flour and mix JUST UNTIL its blended in. I made a lemon bundt pound cake today. i used 1 and 1/2 juice and rind of regular lemons. added vanilla also. I only needed small amount of milk. im goin to glaze this deliciousness with lemon glaze and serve it for thanksgiving dessert.",

Once with a tsp of almond extract and once with a tsp of vanilla.  I scaled it down to 15 servings to make one good sized loaf.  Because I didn't have enough of the right ingredients on hand, I substituted half of the white sugar for brown sugar, and the unsalted butter for salted butter. Instead of using parchment paper I buttered and floured the loaf pan. Result was terrific with (or despite??) my modifications!  Thanks!",
