I also put caramel in holes after I took the pie out of the oven.  Then I made fudge brownies and broke them up and mixed them with melted semi-sweet chocolate and layer it over the pie on top of the caramel.  Then I added the whipped cream and on top of that put shaved chocolate and strings of fudge topping and caramel topping.  I'm a hit!!!",

I made one modification - I melted some chocolate chips with 1/2 teaspoon shortening in the microwave and drizzled it over the whipped cream. Watch out for adding extra nuts - we had too many. We all agreed that the pie base would also be great served warm with ice cream omitting the whipped cream. Its a very flexible pie.",
