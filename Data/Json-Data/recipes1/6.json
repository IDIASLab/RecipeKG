Tender buttery crust creamy white chocolate filling and the timeless combination of chocolate and raspberry. This unquestionably reminded me of petite gourmet desserts you'd find at fine quality brunch buffets. As I melted the semi-sweet chocolate however it didn't seem like it would be nearly enough to cover the top adequately. I doubled it and was happy I did. Other than that I prepared the recipe exactly as directed and was very pleased with it. I lined my pan with foil which made for easy cutting not to mention a clean pan. For ease in cutting run a thin-bladed knife under hot water and wipe dry before effortlessly gliding through the hardened chocolate. Hubs who when he really enjoys something rates it four stars exhuberantly exclaimed \"Ten!\"",

Freeze again for 15 mins and the choc layer spreads easily too. I used frzn cherries 1/8 c lemon juice and 2 tbs tapioca and cooked on stovetill thick. I just prefer fresh berries over jam.

Was really hard to get out of the glass pan. 1 cup of jam was waaay too much for a 9x9 pan. Would use a half cup next time. The cream cheese/white chocolate layer was yummy and I'm not a white chocolate fan. The glaze I omitted the shortening and made a \"ganache\" with whipping cream and used more glaze than called for. All in all it was OK though sooo challenging to get out of the pan and cut up. Stuff slid around and I could hardly keep the bars together. And that was after refrigerating.",
