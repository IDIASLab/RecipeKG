Its very easy to mix together as it does not get so hard like most cookie doughs and it doesnt require refridgeration. Its delicious with that authentic Snickerdoodle taste (much better than starbucks!). Theres virtually no baking time limit (8-16 minutes) as it does not burn easily. Very kid friendly. I would have loved rolling the dough into balls like playdough and rolling it in the cinnamonsugar. This would make an awesome cookie in a jar gift as it requires VERY little extra items. The cinnamon sugar can be packaged into smaller jelly jars that can be bought in supermarkets. I loved the cookies and everyone loved them. Not to sweet with the perfect snickerdoodle tang.",

Also after we had rolled into balls (but BEFORE we put them on the cookie sheets) we rolled the balls into 1/2c sugar and 1/2tsp cinnamon mix. Then we took a glass cup and just flattened them ever so slightly. The cookies baked perfect looked great and tasted awesome! Slightly crunchy on the outside and soft inside. The cinnamon/sugar mix really adds taste and I ate so many I almost made myself sick! These dissapeared after two days and my boyfriend told me to next time TRIPLE the batch!! Thanks Diane!!",
