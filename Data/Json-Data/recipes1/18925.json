We live in the Buffalo area, so the bleu cheese in the recipe resonated with me.  So many wing-dip recipes call for ranch dressing.  I used Frank's Hot Sauce for that authentic Buffalo wing taste.  I found that it needed to cook just a bit longer or at a slightly higher temperature to get it nice and hot all the way through.  15-20 minutes was not long enough.",

If you are reading this, give this a try.\n\nONE WARNING: Warn your guests that this dip is hot. Spicy hot (and maybe temp hot, too).  We had a guest load up their tortilla chips with the dip expecting cheesy and was taken back by the heat. It is a wonderful flavor, sure to please, but make sure your guests know what they are getting.\n\nWill make this again and again. Perfect dip for those who like buffalo chicken! Only comment on the recipe is \"3 chicken breasts\" is too vague for me. We have 1lb breasts and 3lbs of chicken would be a bit too much. Wished it was stated in cups or better yet ounces.",
