I would suggest purchasing at least 18 medium sized peppers and have about 2 1/2 cups of oil for this recipe or use less Prosciutto and Provolone. I used regular olive oil instead of extra virgin olive oil because I prefer the milder taste. When refrigerating the oil may get cloudy but comes back to normal at room temperature.",
