Whether eaten plain, or my favourite way, which is sandwiched with dulce de leche and topped with chocolate ganache, it's brilliant!  One little thing though:  the directions are fine if you want to serve your cake in the pan, but if you want to unmould it for prettier presentation, your pan will need to be greased and floured, or brushed with bakers' secret (which is no secret: combine equal parts oil, shortening, and flour).  This means you should mix the cake in a separate bowl, but hey, it's still really easy and cleanup is minimal.\r\n\r\nNow!  For all you people nervous about the vinegar:  there is a simple reason why it's there.  For a cake to rise, you need an alkali, and an acid.  When the alkali and the acid combine, they react with each other, giving off carbon dioxide, which is what makes the cake rise.  All cakes other than yeast cakes are risen this way.  The alkali/acid deal is present in baking powder (already mixed for you), and in recipes that call for baking soda (alkali) and, say, cream of tartar (acid).  In this case, you have baking soda (alkali) and vinegar (acid).  They react with each other and make the cake rise.  You CANNOT taste the vinegar, so relax, make the cake, and enjoy!",

I don't change the ingredients, but I DO change the method, so if anyone is interested I will describe.  I grease and flour two 9in cake rounds.  Sift all of the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl.  Add the wet ingredients, and stir with a spoon until it's combined.  The vinegar will bubble with the baking soda.. it's supposed to.  The batter will be thin, but that's normal from what I can tell.  Although the recipe calls for a 13x9, when I baked it in that pan it took much longer than called for.  In the two 9in rounds, 30 minutes is perfect.  The cake is moist and there is ABSOLUTELY NO Vinegar taste.. AT ALL.  If you want a super duper chocolatey flavor, replace 1c of the water with coffee.  I know it sounds weird, but you won't taste the coffee.. only enhanced chocolate.  I'm no expert, but like I said.. every time I prepare the cake with this method, it is perfect.",

Last night in utter desperation I googled \"egg free chocolate cake\" (all my soon to be 3 year old wants for his birthday is an \"chocolate Thomas (the Tank Engine) cake\" - I found a 3-d train cake pan but every cake has flopped until today - until I tried the crazy cake - IT IS PERFECT - words cannot thank you enough!

He also couldn't eat vinegar or chocolate, so Amatullah's suggestion about the orange cake conversion was great.  I substituted the cocoa with cornstarch and the vinegar with orange juice, and I added a teaspoon of orange zest.  I also exchanged the baking soda for baking powder.  It turned out perfectly!  If you're making the orange cake, I would suggest frosting it with Adora Marchi's \"Mom's Buttercream Frosting,\" sprinkling a pinch of lemon zest over the frosting, and putting a slice of fresh orange on top.  Be sure to cool the cake completely before applying the frosting.  Thanks Amy and Amatullah; you made my father's birthday very memorable.",

Great when you want cake but not a huge panful.  Also makes great cupcakes (which freeze easily!)\nI love how easy it is to change the flavors!
