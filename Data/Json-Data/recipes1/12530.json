I loved the idea of using yogurt in place of butter for the hollandaise sauce, and I didn't miss the extra fat at all!  Overall, a great recipe, but I think I'll stick to whole wheat english muffins instead of rye.\n\nAlso, don't forget to put a teaspoon or two of white vinegar into your poaching water.  It will help keep the egg whites intact while cooking.  Make sure the water is at a gentle boil rather than an all-out rolling one.",

The sauce has more of an acidic lemon flavor than a butter flavor which you'll get with other benedict recipes. This low calorie version of my all time favorite food will be added to my recipe box as a new staple. As others suggested I diced up a roma tomato and garnished with fresh dill. I think the tomato and dill really made this dish shine. Didn't use the capers or parsley though. Make it even healthier by using whole grain/light english muffins!! Ciao",

The egg and rye bread part was ok...a quick note it doesn't take as long to cook the eggs as the recipe suggests...I ended up with hard boiled eggs instead of ones with a nice runny middle (I'm sure that was operator error as I should've watched them closer). The sauce though was not what I wanted at all. The taste of plain yogurt overpowered all the other ingredients. Most hollandaise sauce recipes I've seen call for butter not yogurt but I thought I'd try it anyway. It was super tart and did not suit my family's taste at all even after adding 1/4 cup of butter. I would do this again but only with a different sauce. (I didn't add the salmon but might try next time when I try a different sauce).",
