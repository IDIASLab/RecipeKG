I did make my own self-rising flour by adding 1 tsp salt and 3 tsp baking powder to all-purpose flour.  I also used an olive oil mayonnaise.  Neither of those things detracted from the final product. Mine cooked a little faster than the 20 minutes.  I have a convection oven and 16 minutes at 400 degrees was perfect.  Thanks for introducing me to this \"new\" way of making biscuits.",
