I followed the recipe as directed,  only adding some chocolate covered/candy coated sunflower seeds because hubs loves 'em, and because they're colorful and festive!  This embellished oatmeal cookie is light, and both crispy and chewy. It's a darn pretty cookie too, as if it came from an old-fashioned neigborhood bakery, substantial looking with crackly tops.  To satisify all preferences I baked some a litte longer than others and while baking time certainly affects texture, all were great!  This recipe should be in everyone's recipe box for the basics - not only is it reliably delicious, there is also much room for versatility with add-ins.  Try adding different flavored chips, chopped white chocolate, dried fruit or raisins, chopped nuts, even chopped up candy bars. Great as is, this cookie is also definitely worth toying with and customizing to suit your mood or tastes!",

They have become a favorite of my family and whenever they ask for cookies, this is what they want.  Sometimes I use half shortening and half butter for a softer cookie. Other times I use all butter for a richer cookie.  Several times I substituted whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour and no one suspected a thing! There are so many variations: use M&Ms  or Reeses Pieces, or white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts instead of chocolate chips. Sometimes I add a cup of chopped pecans  also. Now that I am a grandmother I am making these cookies for a new audience! Just baked a batch to bring to my Marine son and his family! The best recipes are the kind you can vary with your mood, the occasion, and the ones who will enjoy them. This is that kind of recipe! If made with shortening they will keep a long time and can be shipped to someone away. Wrap 2 back to back in waxed paper or plastic wrap. Place packs in a zipper bag and then in a sturdy box for shipping. There should be minimal breakage.",

They wonderful and they are supposed to be a bit hard. The reason for this is(according to my mom): They are called 'cowboy cookies' because they traveled well in the cowboys saddle bags when they were out on the range and did not crumble as other cookies did. The harder outer shell was ideal. It sure makes sense to me and I love the story. Just wanted to share that tid bit of information! Great cookie!",
