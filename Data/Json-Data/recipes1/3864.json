Not sure quite what to say about it or even how to say it but I ll try to give you the bad and the good IMO. It certainly is non-traditional for a pie and you can t even serve it like a pie because it crumbles and falls apart (maybe a more descriptive name would be Cracker Crumble I?). After it came out of the oven the top was all cracked and when I tried to cut a slice it just broke apart. So that s the bad. And now the good. It is crazy easy to make and actually tastes pretty decent. Filling leans toward the texture you d have in a pecan pie just firmer and drier. There a pleasant sweetness from the dates and a little crunch from the walnuts. We ate it in a bowl with a dollop of whipped cream not as a slice of pie on a plate. We all eat with our eyes even before the first bite and this has very poor eye appeal. And that s the bad at least for me. It actually tastes OK that s the good but it s not good enough for me to make again. Could be this is the way cracker pie should look I don t know so I don t want to discourage others from trying it but it just didn t work for me.",

I didn\u2019t have saltines so I used Matzo that I had in the cabinet, but wasn\u2019t sure how much to use because the crackers aren\u2019t the same so I guessed. I also used cut up pitted dates, same thing, wasn\u2019t sure of amounts, but I kept on. I liked it but I would definitely like to make it again using the same measurements as the recipe to see how I did :)",
