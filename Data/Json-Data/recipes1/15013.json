I make the chicken by cutting up chicken breasts, seasoning with garlic salt and onion powder, placing on foil lined baking sheet, covering with foil and placing in oven @ 375 for 35 mins (or until juices run clear). \nInstead of cream of celery, I use one can of cream of chicken & mushroom. I also use just the tiniest pinch of thyme and add pepper and garlic salt to taste. I usually forgo the veggies (shame on me). \nI agree with other reviewers that you should either cook the biscuits a little beforehand or turn them over halfway through to avoid soggy bottom biscuits on this casserole. Although, turning the biscuits over after 15 mins and continuing to bake the casserole doesn\u2019t really hurt anything.",
