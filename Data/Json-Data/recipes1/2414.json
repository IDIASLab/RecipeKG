Absolutely delicious with some butter and a cup of hot tea. Thanks, Carol for a great recipe!!",

Ended up baking for 70 minutes. It was a great success in his class, as well as with the family (we sneaked a piece!) Very moist and delicious... I'll make this one again!",

I think cinnamon would work well, too.  2) The dry ingredients can be beaten together with the wet ingredients - it's not necessary to stir them (until moistened).  3) The apple peel can be left on.  I grated 4 apples with a cheese grater, and I left the peels on the apples.  This adds a little bit of extra fiber to the bread, and doesn't change the consistency.  4) When I tried to remove the bread from the pan after 10 minutes of cooling, part of the bottom fell apart.  I waited longer for the second loaf, and it didn't fall apart.  With these changes, I will use this recipe again and again!  It's fabulous!",

As of 9/27/17 I have still been making this recipe however instead of sugar I use unsweetened apple sauce in equal amounts. Makes it moist but not too moist. Also if you don't eat it all in one sitting like what usually happens at my house cut and serve from the middle out and when you remove a piece push it back together. Keeping the butts of the bread on helps seal the moisture in a little longer.",

It didn't seem too dry though it did brown much quicker than the recipe suggested (could just be my oven). If I make this again I will definitely follow the suggestions of other reviewers and double the apples (maybe use granny smiths for a stronger flavor-- i used one big fuji) and add cinnamon and cloves to the batter. It's a nice basic recipe though just needs some tweaking.",
