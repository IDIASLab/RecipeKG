My advice is to have the baking dish lined with waxed paper or foil ready and have the marshmallow fluff, peanut butter and vanilla in the bowl so when you remove the milk/sugar mixture from the heat, you can just dump the fluff/peanut butter in the pan and get right to mixing it up quickly. You got to work fast and trying to scoop the fluff out of the jar is too time consuming.",

DEBRAPRICE gave great advice about the temperature:  \"If you don't have a thermometer, just boil (med-low heat) for 6 minutes after boiling begins.\"  The fudge turned out wonderful. I am definitely going to be using this recipe again!  Edited to add: I have made this fudge many more times and just wanted to add a couple more things. I butter the pan and then place wax paper in it to make for easier cleanup. Also it is easier to get the fudge out. I have found that if I boil the mixture for 10 minutes it turns out a little more firm, just how my family loves it. Thanks again!  Update (2/4/09): I bought a silicone pan and it has been a lifesaver! No more fussing with wax paper or greasing a pan. All you have to do is dump the fudge in the silicone pan (placed on a baking sheet for structure) and pop it in the fridge. It sets up perfectly. Once you're ready to cut it all you do is turn the silicone pan upside down and the big \"block\" of fudge easily comes out on it's own. It's so much easier this way, plus the fudge doesn't get mangled at all while cutting!",

Tip:  It took between 10-15 minutes on medium heat (about 10 of those were \"rolling boil\" minutes) before it reached the ball-forming stage (aka time to add the marshmallow and peanut butter).  It set fast too; It looked like fudge by the time it was in the pan.  :)  I sprinkled chocolate chips over half the fudge as it cooled; They melt a bit but that makes it easier to cut the squares later.

My first attempt I used the candy thermometer removing it from the heat once the temperature reached soft ball stage. It never set up. The second time I tried letting it boil for a full six minutes as was suggested by another reviewer. It never set up. I blamed the weather it was rainy and unseasonably humid on the day I attempted it and have read this can definitely have an effect on fudge setting up. My 3rd attempt the weather was dry and cold. I let the mixture boil for a full 8 minutes this time. It never set up. All 3 attempts ended up as a sugary sludge that found its way down my garbage disposal. My 4th attempt was another recipe that turned out perfectly on the first attempt. I really wanted this recipe to work. I have no idea what went wrong but one thing that I do know for sure is that I will never attempt this recipe again.",
