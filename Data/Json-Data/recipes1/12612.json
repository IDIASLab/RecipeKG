You should crush the sliced lime (unpeeled, please!) and the sugar in a glass, mix in the cacha\u00e7a (or rum) and a few ice cubes. As for the comments on using either limes or lemons, I can assure you that what is sold in the US as lime is exactly what Brazilians call \"lim\u00e3o Tahiti\". So, go with the lime!",

If you have more than a few drinks, the industrial Cacha\u00e7a (Velho Barreiro, Ypioca, 51) will probably give you a headache and a hangover the next day. A good quality Cacha\u00e7a (artesanal), won't! Cheers from Brazil!!!\r\n",

Im sure its great with pineapple and many other things but then it aint a Caiparinha. 4. No matter how good the cachaca, or how well you follow the recipe or how good the company is - it'll never ever ever  taste the same as it does in a bar anywhere in Brasil with the samba music blaring and the beautiful multicultural crazy clientel all around you - so do yourself a favour and go visit the most beautiful, hospitable and downright loco country in the world! and Yes Scotland runs a very close second- we just don't get the weather :)",

I believe that thousands of poor american citizens were instructed the wrong way on caipirinha recipe. Blame on brazilians bad english knowledge (I`m one of them - but I do not confuse \"vital\" things like that...). One more thing: caipirinha is made of lime, sugar and cacha\u00e7a on the rocks.
