But I have to say it lacked soooo much flavor!!! I added a teaspoon of Knorr vegetable bouillon more soy sauce and a bit pepper. It came out good but only after seasoning it. Since my husband doesn't eat broccoli I set some beef aside and used orange and green bell pepper instead. It was just as good again with my additional seasoning. Will definitely do it again but not according to the original recipe posted here.",
