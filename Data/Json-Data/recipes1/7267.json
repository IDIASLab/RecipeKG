I called it \"1 2 3 Puffed Pastry\" because I always doubled the recipe for my LARGE extended family, for the holidays. I remembered the amounts \"1 2 3\" but my mind kept telling me I used cream cheese. When I found this recipe the light went on...LOL I used SOUR CREAM... not cream cheese...DUH! Roll the dough out thin (1/8\" to 1/4\") cut out 2-1/2\" rounds of dough. Place a scant teaspoonful of Solo brand fruit, nut, or poppy seed filling down the center. Fold the sides up and over the filling, overlapping the dough and pinching together to keep the dough from unfolding during baking. Bake on parchment lined cookie sheets, in a 375 degree oven, 12 to 15 mins or until light golden brown. When baked, cool completely on wire rack and dust with powdered sugar. Since there is no sugar in the dough you can even use savory fillings of cheeses, vegetables or meats, for great appetizers. I can't THANK YOU enough, Patti. My family will be delighted, that I can make one of their favorites once again.",

Make sure you put some flour on the counter before you roll so it won't stick and also over the dough. It may be hard once it came out from the fridge but please be patient because once you started rolling it it becomes more softer after. Sprinkle flour often on top so the dough won't stick to the roller. I usually bake it at 350 F and the result is just amazing. My friends love it.",
