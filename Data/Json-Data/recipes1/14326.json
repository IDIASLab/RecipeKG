A couple of notes:  If you are using lavender flowers you may want to decrease the amount to 2 Tbsp instead of 1/4 cup, otherwise it could taste a little strong.  When you make the lavender tea at first, it will be a brownish color... but the instant you add lemon juice, it transforms into a lovely pink.  Fun!  Sometimes I make a concentrate of the sugar/lavender/lemon and then mix it with ginger ale for a sparkling lavender lemonade.  Excellent for bridal showers, Mother's Day luncheons, etc.",
