You can't go wrong w/ this dip. **The tough part was finding the \"Beau Monde\" spice (which is a unique mix of salt, celery & onion powder: \"Spice Islands\u00ae\" is the brand I found in a regular grocery store finally & use now). Also a good spice for use in any cold summer salads.  Thanks for sharing, CATWOMAN2! ",
