This was part of the same cut of meat I used for another recipe, and that one did not come out juicy and tender.  I let it marinate for quite a few hours.  From reading the other reviews... I'd have to say I understand why lots of people would find this salty but unfortunately I happen to be a salt addict.  Plus I love the tanginess of soy sauce.  So if you like tangy, this is great.  If you don't, this is probably not your recipe.  And probably your average person should cut down on the salt.\nEvery once in a while I find it necessary to add certain comments:  ZeroCreature (an apt name), not that you'll ever see this, but you are quite insulting and egotistical.  Do people not have the right to just plain not like a recipe w/out your permission or insulting opinion about it?  There are at least 2 expert cooks who gave this a 1 or 2, and I'm quite sure they know their behind from a hole in the ground.",

I also made it a wet marinade (with the full cup of sauce) instead of a wet rub and kept it in a Ziploc in the fridge for about four hours before broiling it. Dad compared it to the Outback...
