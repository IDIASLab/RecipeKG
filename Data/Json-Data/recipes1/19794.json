It is time consuming but all things considering not that hard. I have not been able to reply to some of the questions on here but after making these many times now I will answer from my experience. 1- You can use regular unsalted butter. They will still turn out but lose some of their crispiness. If you want the full experience really try to find the low moisture. 2- I have made it with and without the nutmeg. Although it does add another layer of flavor even this small amount can sometimes seem overwhelming. I prefer it without but it is really up to your personal taste. 3- I usually do refrigerate overnight so that we can enjoy these for breakfast. I go through all of the steps of folding in the butter and then for the 2 hour refrigerated rising I leave it in the fridge overnight. Just be aware that the dough will rise A LOT so make sure you leave it in loose plastic wrap and even then I like to store it in a bigger container with a lid. 4- Part 2 calls for grapeseed oil. I highly recommend finding some as it adds the \"donut store taste\". However I have found through many trials that using about half grapeseed oil and half coconut oil lends itself to just the right balance of crispiness without getting overly greasy. You can use vegetable oil but it will not turn out as well. The",
