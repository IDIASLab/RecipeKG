We roll it out paper thin then add Solo Brand Poppy Seed Almond or any type of preserves you like. When we cut out the dough with a glass we fill it then we fold the corners to make a small popover then we pierce it with a fork to keep it together. We cook them for 12- 14 minutes. Everything else is pretty much the same. If you would like more info contact me via email. This is a wonderful recipe.",

Vanilla and added it with my hands because I don't have dough hooks and I had to defrost myself several times with warm water. I realize now I could have worn gloves but it doesn't matter. I rolled the cookies to about 1/4 inch thickness and made the holes with my thumb. I filled the holes with strawberry preserves. The cookies were perfect good flavor texture and appeararance. Also easy to make. MAke this recipe!!!",

Making the 1/8 inch circles did not work for me. After baking for 20 minutes the center was not done..I baked and baked the center never cooked and the edges were getting dark...I threw that batch away. I saw another reviewer had mentioned rolling them paper thin and folding them over with the filling inside. I did this and they came out perfectly (I reduced heat to 325 and checked them frequently) Thanks for sharing I will definately make this again.",

I did find the dough a bit wet and adding an extra 2/3c. of four helped greatly.When rolling out the cookies we use powdered sugar instead of flour. It gives the cookies an added sweetness. The only other variant is the way way we cut out the cookies. We cut squares aproxamently 2x2 and add a small dollop of lekvar apricot or nut filling then roll tightly pressing the open ends to seal. Thank you so much for posting this recipie and giving me a wonderful holiday cookie from my childhood.",

                "reviewBody": "I hope this is helpful to those trying this for the first time. This is a pastry and should be made with butter-not margerine-or spreads. Butter is from cream margerine is from soybean or corn oil and a spread contains up to 50% water. There is a huge difference in using butter vs. margerine and an even bigger difference if you use a spread. The success of this recipe depends on using butter. Those reviews that recommend adding more flour are likely not using butter and are also likely to have a tougher pastry as a result of adding more flour. This recipe is perfect as written and these pastries will melt in your mouth if you make them as directed. Refrigeration will firm up the dough so you can cut out your pastries. We make these at Christmas and special occasions and use holiday cookie cutters. You can roll the dough out using powdered sugar (don't use flour-it will make them tough) but I roll out dough on wax paper on my cookie sheets adding no powdered sugar if possible. I return it to the fridge to firm before cutting out the shapes with cookie cutters and place them on the baking sheet. Do this quickly as the butter will return to room temp and be difficult to cut. If this happens return to the fridge till firm and continue cutting out cookies. After baking then sprinkle with powdered sugar or drizzle with a glaze. I've never used a jelly or jam as they are thinner than the solo brands of fruit fillings. This will be a 10 star pastry for you.",
