Chocolate chips have an added agent in them to keep its shape - I use regular melting chocolate instead which melts to a thinner consistency and remains \"wetter\" longer than melted chocolate chips. I dip the marshmallows 1/2 way in the chocolate and then sprinkle them with rainbow sprinkles. It is always a big hit! Sometimes I also add some pink marshmallows.",

Fairly easy recipe I did need to add a little shortening to my chocolate chips because they weren't wanting to melt smoothly. I only dipped half the marshmallow into the chocolate and found that the 2 cups of melted chips was plenty to dip the whole bag of marshmallows. I also sprinkled the end of each marshmellows with colored sprinkles. Fun and yummy!",
