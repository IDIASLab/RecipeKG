Two shots side by side the color was slightly different but I'm thinking it's just my brand of dark brown sugar.  The scent of both was pretty dead on but Disarono has a slight rubbing alchohol leftover scent towards the end.  Finally the taste test, the Disaronno had a slightly stronger and sharper aftertaste.  This amaretto had a smoother, fuller, and a tad bit sweeter taste to it.  Surprisingly I'd have to say I like this amaretto more than Disaronno.  Give it a try.  It's worth the effort and ingredients.",
