Had to add an extra tbsp of cream to get a less pasty consistency, so I made a second batch because the first wasn't enough to cover the whole layer cake. This batch I used just 1 cup of confectioners sugar and it helped a lot. Next time I'll probably go with a cream cheese icing.",

This cake far exceeded the expectations I had for it.  It is moist, delicately spiced with nutmeg (I used freshly grated), with a substantial yet light crumb.  Frosting these with Cinnamon Coffee Frosting, also from this site, was like a match made in heaven.  The proof was this: I beckoned Hubs to try a cupcake so that I might get his opinion for my review.  I somehow missed that he had already eaten two of them, apparently when I blinked.",

Because the cake itself is quite sweet, I think a cream cheese icing would work really well with this recipe, too. I made a maple-brown sugar buttercream because I wanted something that tasted like fall (if you know what I mean). I baked cupcakes instead of a layer cake; it made 15 regular-sized cupcakes. I baked them for 20 minutes (I had two pans of cupcakes; the first pan was done in 20 min. and the other pan took another minute and a half.) I would definitely make these again.",
