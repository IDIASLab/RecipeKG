I had a problem with them exploding open in the oven, but found that I needed to roll the dough thinner and I probably need to use a bigger circle.  I did not think that using a 2 and 3/4 inch diameter circle would make a difference, but it did.  It was hard to get enough jelly in them. But all that aside, it is one of the most delicious cookies I have ever tried and I will keep trying until I can make them perfect (or until I weigh 500 pounds which ever comes first)!",

For those who found the dough 'difficult' to work with I offer a suggestion: It is helpful to form about a generous 'cup' of dough into a 'patty' before refrigerating it. I made three 'fat' patties out of this recipe then wrapped them in plastic wrap before refrigerating. Place them on the counter to soften A BIT before rolling them out. This makes them easy to roll out....hope this helps:D",

I ended up tossing batches in and out of the freezer as I made 4-5 cookies at a time. I went through A LOT of flour just to keep from it sticking to my workspace. All in all the cookies look ok taste great. But the time and labor that went into about 20 cookies (I had to scrap a couple from leaking) could be better spent with something else.",
