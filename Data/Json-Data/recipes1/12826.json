If you aren't into butter sautee the onions in olive oil and omit buttering the bread. It still comes out great. Evaperated milk (low fat or regular) compliments the sweetness of the onions. I have also used different creamed soups...cream of onion is really nice...and substituted worchestershire for the soy sauce. Sprinkle a little more swiss cheese for the last few minutes of baking.",

It was a very satisfying side dish with our pork roast. The next time I made it I tweaked it..with... sourdough bread instead of italian, 3 sweet onions and 1 large red onion,  1/2 provolone and 1/2 swiss for the cheese..plus 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper, 1/2 teaspoon ground thyme and a splash of balsamic vinegar in the soup mixture.  It was extremely good too. Different 'notes' to experience between the two versions.  Loved them both. Still have not found my perfect tear free way of dealing with the onions tho. Anyway, great recipe! Thanks so much :)",
