I am always amazed when reviewers completely change the recipe and then rate it low as though they made it as described and it wasn't good. This recipe requires real prosciutto and is better with fresh sage which can grow outdoors all year in most of the USA. Try it without loading it with cheese -- it's a delicate dish. Maybe a little Parmesan sprinkled on top before serving.",

I used the same amount of ingredients called for but spread it over 8 pieces of chicken. I doubled the wine/sauce - when I realized how good it was I knew everyone would want extra. The key is having the chicken pounded very thin - I was able to roll these without toothpicks. Then I moved them to the pan and cooked them well on the bottom where the roll is seamed before turning - this ensured that they stayed together. After that I was able to turn them onto the other sides to finish cooking.",

For 3 chicken breasts I mixed 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil with 1 Tablespoon minced garlic. I brushed this on both sides of the chicken then sprinkled both sides with black pepper - no salt (the prosciutto has enough salt). I then wrapped one piece of prosciutto around each chicken breasts - I didn't roll up the chicken. I pan fried the chicken in 2 tablespoons of butter until brown on both sides. I then removed the chicken from the pan deglazed the pan with about half of the white wine added one can of sliced mushrooms and cooked for a little then added the rest of the wine. I then put the chicken back in the pan covered it and simmered until the chicken was done. To thicken the liquid I mixed 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch with 1 1/2 tsp cold water then added to the pan. I also added a little chicken broth to make more of the yummy gravy. Spoon the mushrooms and gravy over the chicken and it is delicious!!!",
