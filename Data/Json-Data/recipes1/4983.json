I think the people who rated those reviews as \"helpful\" never even tried this recipe!  SHAME ON YOU!!!!  IT IS GREAT!    I prepared the recipe as recommended, but with chicken breasts.  And i have to say I totally loved it!  I was worried about such a short cooking time for the chicken, but it turned out just right.  And that splash of lemon at the end, incredible, dont leave it out!  Hope that you try this, you wont regret it!",

With a lil doctoring this is a 5 but I rate a 3 for a decent recipe. No offense Teresa mind you this is just my opinion which may mean nothing to you others! Thanks for posting!",
