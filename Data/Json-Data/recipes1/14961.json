This is the critical point. Five stars, if not for the slightly high sweetness (and I'm a sugarholic). ALL kids will devour them.  Busy/cheap people, try these variations: Quarter sweet potato and nuke for 8 minutes (check: skin pulls off easily when done, but tears when overdone) Trade honey for brown sugar. Don't feel bad skimping on either. These muffins are plenty sweet. Use 1/2 Cup skim milk instead of yogurt If cloves or ginger aren't handy, try allspice. Mash the potato with the oil, it makes it easier.",

This turned out wonderfully and you can feel pretty good about their healthy ingredients.  I took other's advice and cut down on the sweetener - I used 1/2 cup of Agave syrup and it turned out perfectly sweet.  I also substituted milk for the vanilla yogurt and I put a touch of melted light butter into my topping with a bit of water to hold it all together.  I let the batter sit for about 45 minutes before I baked them.  These are delicious and I'll be making them often.",

I used applesauce instead of the oil per other suggestions & used only 1/2 cup of honey. Other than that kept everything else the same for the muffin ingredients. The taste is perfect! Not too sweet but sweet enough. The oat topping is a nice touch! I halved the topping & it was just the right amount for 18 muffins. Thank you so much for this recipe! Will definitely be making these again.:)",

My sweet potato was pretty large and these came out so moist and not too heavy maybe due to the white whole wheat flour. Will make often! Thanks for this lovely recipe!",

I have a huge sweet tooth and I could stand to have these sweeter but then again they are still tasty.

I would give them five stars except I thought that a cup of honey is overkill (I cut it down to 1/2 cup) the timing was off (I had to bake for about 30 minutes) and they would have been WAY to liquidy if I had put in the yogurt. With those changes these are perfect.",
