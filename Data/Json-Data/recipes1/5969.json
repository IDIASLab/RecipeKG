I read the reviews cut the sugar in half and thought it had just the right amount of sweetness. I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings and it converted nicely. The white wine vinegar was almost a little too mellow for us so I will try something a bit bolder the next time maybe white balsamic or just apple cider vinegar.",
