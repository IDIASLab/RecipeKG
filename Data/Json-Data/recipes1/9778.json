These waffles turned out soft and a little tough not tender and crispy as we like them. I'd rather make French toast which is quicker and easier anyway. Or I'd rather spend a few extra minutes making waffles from scratch. These didn't even taste as good as frozen Eggos to me. However my kids gobbled them up. If you like soft waffles rather than crispy you may like these.",
