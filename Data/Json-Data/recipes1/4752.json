I also cooked the chicken in olive oil instead of frying. I will say that I tasted it before baking it and it was much more flavorful after baking it.",

To cook the chicken I first marinated it for a few hours in milk egg and garlic powder.

This was a good choice. Some changes I made was that I used 1/2 and 1/2 which I am glad I did and I baked the chicken instead of frying because I always seem to overcook it. I stirred the cornstarch into the chicken broth in a separate dish before adding to the skillet to avoid lumps... I wish I had thought more ahead to cook the pasta after I got the sauce cooking because I cooked the pasta first but by the time I was ready to put it in the dish it was all stuck together and cold. I also baked the whole dish for about 15 minutes covered. Next time I might add some mozzarella....",
