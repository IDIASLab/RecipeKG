I always pound the chicken breasts thinner and season well with S&P garlic and onion powders and a little crushed rosemary and thyme before browning. I never have blandness probs as another reviewed stated and I think it's because I season well before cooking. I've been using this recipe for years cut from off a Swanson broth can! I like anothers suggestion of adding diced onion and apple...will try that next time!",

When the veggies were ready I took out the yams and a little more than half the stock/herbs and hand-blended them adding a little butter and maple syrup. I figured this way I could save the mashed yams and beans for tomorrow's side dish. Since I cook for two I like to stretch out recipes as much as I could. The remaining stock in the pan with the green beans and chicken made a nice au jus. My husband gave it a nine out of ten!",
