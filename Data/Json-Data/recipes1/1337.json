The recipe calls for pecans, I didn't have any, so I used sliced almonds...  but I really wished I had left the nuts out... not only because my 2 brothers dont eat nuts and they were very dissapointed when they found out there was nuts in the cake, but also because I didnt feel as though they belonged in the cake, and if you think about it, milky ways dont have nuts, so they really shouldn't be in the cake!  ALSO, very important, the frosting...  I had the cake on a raised cake plate.  Once it cooled, and the frosting cooled, I poured it over the cake, but not all of it because it was very very 'liquidy' and it drizzled down the sides, it was a big mess, it dripped off of the cake plate and onto my counter.  The frosting was very yummy, but if it was thicker, it would have been much better.  Alot of it did stay on the cake , but alot of it also dripped right off, and I still had 1/2 of it left that I poured on individual pieces when serving. YUM \r\nGood Luck!!",
