Because I did not have raspberry jelly I did not add it. Even with the small changes it was great. I might add a touch of honey next time but you know I don't think it really needs it. The raspberries and bananas were great together and both the tofu and banana thickened it up perfectly. My husband wouldn't touch it (he saw the tofu) but both the kids and I thought it was yummy! NOTE: This would make a GREAT summer ice-pop recipe. Just pour the smoothie into little dixie cups leaving an inch of room at the top freeze until firm and stick a popsicle in each dixie cup. Freeze solid.",
