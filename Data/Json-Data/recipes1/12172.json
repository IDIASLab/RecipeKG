I could not taste the herbs throughout the chicken though; only on the breast area where the herbs were stuffed under the skin. Next time I will try inserting the butter and herbs throughout the entire bird so there will be more of those yummy herbal bites. Thanks!",

Seasoned outside of the chicken with salt and pepper (out of habit). Our chicken was 5.5-6lb and took about 4.5-5 hr hours to cook through (removed when internal temp hit 165 F). Let rest for 10 minutes before carving. Thanks for the recipe!",
