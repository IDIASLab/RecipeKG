The remnants we used as a solvent for removing stubborn road tar from the underside and wheel wells of our cars.",

Put in a cool dark place in a closed glass container I used several gallon Glass jars. Shake it up a few times during the week. Put in cooler or bowl to serve ice is your call but I left it clean and had ice in bucket next to cooler. Also used Consentrated Juice mix instead of powders and a little water. If not into cutting fruit dump in cans of already chopped or sliced fruit juice and all. Be warned a few glasses will knock you down! A bowl of the fruit will also remove most inhibitions!! Pinapples and apples really soak this up! Also be warned it stains the cooler and any clothing it hits!!",
