I did change this recipe a little as I only had Vanilla Instant pudding mix and was worried by using this I would not have much of a lemon flavor. I added 1 tablespoon of lemon zest and also a teaspoon of lemon extract. As always I used applesauce in place of the oil. Baked for 60 minutes and the cake was cooked to perfection. I just loved the moist lemon taste great recipe that you can throw together in a few minutes. No once would honestly think this came out of a box!!!",
