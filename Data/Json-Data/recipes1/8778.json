Used cayenne pepper instead of paprika adjusting the heat to your preference. Used parchment paper and do not overcook-adjust time according to your oven-mine was 20 minutes cooking time. I put toothpicks in each one and they were very impressive on a platter and delicious. I made some them ahead of time and froze them in a zip-lock bag after refrigerating them for several hours to prevent them from sticking together in the bag. I allowed the frozen ones to sit out before baking about 30 minutes before baking otherwise they can be dry. This is my favorite snack for my family and they like a large pecan inside the ball instead of an olive or sausage to change it up. I put a few drops of food color in the dough to mix them up: Red food color for hot with cayenne and sausages....Green for olives...Yellow for pecans....Looks pretty for buffet table. I used Kraft Shreddered sharp cheddar cheese only for the best flavor. JUst experiment but too much flour will make them dry. The pan does not need to be greased and using parchment paper makes an easy clean-up possible. The heat from sausages tabasco or cayenne pepper picks it up and you can always omit the heat for those who can't eat it. The food coloring of the dough allows everyone to choose their preference.Enjoy!",
