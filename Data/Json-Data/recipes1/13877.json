I cooked a 13 lb bird at 350 degrees and it took 2-1/2 hours.   I cut a large onion in quarters and a bulb of garlic in half and stuck it in the turkey cavity as well as seasoning the cavity with salt & pepper.  You don't need to even peel the onion or garlic - just cut it and put it in the cavity. This will give the drippings a great flavor and help infuse your bird with flavor.  I also carefully lifted the skin from the breast and liberally massaged the raw breast with a mixture of softened butter with some garlic powder, dried parsley, & rubbed sage.  I then rubbed the same mixture over the entire bird before I bagged it and sprinkled with coarse sea salt.  Rubbing butter over the breast will help keep the breast meat moist and flavorful.  You can use just butter or any combination of seasoning you like added in.  Just be careful not to tear the skin.  I also let it rest about 20 minutes or so in the bag after I took it out of the oven.  I plan on using this bagged method in the future because it really did help keep the bird moist and no basting!",
