My kids and I all loved it! My oldest even asked me to make it for him again tomorrow! As far as following the recipe I used frozen strawberries so left out the ice. I subbed orange juice (3/4 cup) in place of the whole orange and tossed in a banana. I also added another 1/4 cup of coconut milk at the end because it seemed a little thick (maybe because of the addition of the banana?). The result was delicious! We'll definitely be making this one again and again!!",
