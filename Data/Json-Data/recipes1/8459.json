As I grew older I asked her for the recipe but she said it was a family recipe and when I got married she would give me the recipe. Time went by and I never did get the recipe. Fast forward; I saw this box of Nun-such dried fruit with a cookie recipe on the side. It looked interesting so I made them. And behold - my grandmothers recipe. I make these cookies every Christmas season and it brings back memories of grandma and the wonderful family traditions that we have today. I love this recipe all the more because it s getting harder to find the box of mincemeat to make them.",
