I also make this on a cookie sheet instead of in a pan. You can make it bigger that way :-D",

On the bottom layer make sure you leave a little upward edge with the dough as you have to connect it with the top layer later. 2. WAY too much liquid for the crust which completely threw off my recipe. I didn't realize it until too late (alas- should have read the previous reviewer). And I only used about 1/2 of the egg water mixture. I would also 1.5 times the crust ingredients as I ran out of crust on top. So my presentation was awful due to the crust situation but if you take 1 & 2 into consideration early on I bet it would be awesome. It's basically apple pie bars. Sadly I couldn't taste or sense the corn flakes.",

But it's very important to chill the dough for about 30 minutes before trying to roll it out. Chilling pastry dough makes all the difference when trying to work with it. I chilled it and had no problems rolling it out on a lightly floured surface. I would also recommend using just a bit more than half for the bottom crust since it needs to cover the side of the pan.",

I took this to a young adults Sunday School class and they all loved it. I might try to make more of an icing for it next time the glaze didn't do much for me. My suggestion is to roll out the dough on a silicone pastry mat and then flip it into the pan. That's the only thing that worked for me. I only used about 1/2 of the sugar but it was still great tasting. Will make again! Thanks for this recipe!",

I also found the crust to be bland and could have used a little sugar in it. Otherwise good bars. The liquid mixture was too wet and I had to add more flour before rolling (1 yolk enough water to = 2/3 cup was too much) so an easy fix. You won't taste the cornflakes or get a crunch from them with each bite. They soak up the liquid from the sugar and apples. I thought 10 apples would be too much after cutting them but they cook down a lot and ended up being perfect. I liked the 'apple pie in bar format' and will try this again. Using margarine does make it a very inexpensive dessert.",
