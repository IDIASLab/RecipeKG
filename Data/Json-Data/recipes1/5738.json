Here's what she would do: (1) used a large Dutch Oven (the \"spaghetti pot\") rather than a skillet; (2) always used Olive Oil as her \"vegetable oil\"; (3) dipped the chicken pieces in egg prior to dredging them in flour; (4) used parsley and/or basil rather than oregano; (5) never used mushrooms; (6)pierced the onion and put it in whole (and then discarded it before serving the stew); (7) sliced the green peppers in strips rather than chopping them; (8) used red wine rather than white; (9) added carrots and potatoes (which she had cleaned, peeled, quartered and par-cooked) to the pot half-way through the cooking time (which was more like 45 minutes than 30). We used to eat this right from the pot when we were kids it was so delicious. I tend to remove the pieces from the pot first to a serving dish or salad bowl, let them sit for a while (perhaps 10 minutes), and then remove them, the vegetables and as much of the \"sauce\" as I want to yet another serving dish (less greasy that way). My family loves this dish, and prepared this way, there's no need to serve it \"over\" or \"alongside of\" anything.",

The extra ingredients worked well to cover the chicken while cooking.  The chicken turned out SO tender!  It was falling off the bone.  I really didn't think a half hour would actually cook it.  It really needed salt to bring out the flavor, though.  I recommend 1 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.  Next time I would only use 1 cup flour for a lighter coating.",

Yes, I too added more seasonings and totally skipped the flour coating as it's not necessary and actually gets in the way during the browning process. The key to a really good cacciatore is to brown the chicken very, very well. The oil is also not needed as the chicken will produce its own. Once browned, you're left with those wonderful tasty bits on the bottom of your pan that helps to make an incredible and almost brown colored hearty sauce. I also suggest letting the chicken and sauce simmer for a couple of hours to really bring out the flavors. If you have a cast iron skillet or dutch oven, all the better. Good basic recipe Jana and thanks so much!!!!",

Used two cans of diced tomatoes for more sauce and added green onions along with regular one.  I like my sauces THICK, so I added 3 small cans of tomato paste.  If you don't, use at least one or the sauce will be tasty but runny.  The longer you cook on a low simmer, the more the meat will fall off the bone.  Remember to occasionally stir for all cook times, long or short.  Oh yeah, if you're able, brown chicken in just about ANYTHING but vegetable oil (olive, canola, Country Crock spread.....all are a little healthier).  Thanx for the recipe, yo!!

I doubled the peppers and onions, but cut them into 1-inch pieces.  I used a cup of red wine, twice the garlic, and a small can of tomato sauce at the end when I thought it was a little too liquidy.
