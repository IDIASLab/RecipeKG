I subbed a stalk of chives for the cilantro a lime for a lemon and chicken stock for olive oil. I also decided to sweeten the onions up by saut\u00e9ing them in the last drops of my olive oil. And I used two avocados that were medium sized. So the recipe may have been changed around a good bit but the heart of it was the same. The guac/dip/spread had a great nutty flavor while still allowing the richness of the avocado to play with the citrus and spices present. And just to backup the validity of this seemingly odd recipe two of my hispanic friends who have grown up with and enjoy authentic guacamole LOVED it. Make this the next time you're looking for a little change of pace!",
