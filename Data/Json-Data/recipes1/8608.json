Also, adding a  heaping TLB of INSTANT TAPIOCA to the apples when you toss them will thicken any excess juice without adding additional flour.  It won't change the taste.

I did tweak the recipe slightly, taking into consideration all of the previous comments.    Here's what I did: \n\n1. Used a good homemade all butter crust and a glass pie plate   2.  Used half Fuji and half Granny Smith apples, totalling 3 pounds (a little more than five cups)   3.  Increased the flour to a rounded quarter cup   4.  Omitted the lemon zest (don't like lemon and apple together) and the allspice (didn't have any) and substitued quick oats for rolled ones.\n\nI also discovered that you can do the initial baking of the apples and crust ahead of time.  I had to leave, so I just took it out of the oven, lightly covered with foil and when I returned 3 hours later to finish baking it, it worked out great.  \n\nWith the full three pounds of apples I used, and all that streusel topping, it looks HUGE before it bakes but it comes out the perfect size.\n\nWith a glass pie plate I dropped the oven temp to 360 degrees and I ended up baking it much longer (at least ten or fifteen minutes longer) until I could view the browned crust on the bottom (easy with a glass pan)  This is crucial because otherwise you get a soggy crust on the bottom.\n\nWe ate the pie after it had totally cooled and the slices held together perfectly.  Delicious!  Give it a try!",

Having said that, I found a few things with my second batch of pies that I would like to share.  The crust does indeed go soggy and tends not to bake at the bottom, so for the second batch of 3 pies, I first brushed the frozen pie shells with lightly beaten egg whites before filling (it acts as a barrier and prevents the sogginess) and I also baked the pies at the lowest rack setting of my oven for 20 minutes at 425 degrees.  Once I lowered the oven temperature to 375 degrees, I placed the pies back on the middle rack.  I also used three LEVEL tablespoons of flour in the filling...I found the three heaping tablespoons recommended by other reviewers to be too pasty and two tablespoons to be too runny.  I didn't have any problems with the apples not cooking through, but I sliced them very thinly because the lower sugar/water content in granny smiths tends to make them hold their shape and stay firm otherwise.  It is a very good recipe and  definitely worth a try.",

I made a few minor changes:  I didn't freeze the pie shell - couldn't see the advantage.  And I didn't have allspice, so I found on a website a perfect substitute:  1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves and 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg, mixed together. This will make more than the 1/4 teaspoon called for, so I just saved the extra, put it in a little jar and labeled it \"allspice\" for my next recipe that calls for it.

I used Jonagold in one, Granny Smith in the other. I used some of the suggestions in the reviews (no lemon zest, 3 T. flour). I find Granny Smiths will stay too firm for my family's liking at only 40 min. baking, so for that pie I cooked the apple mixture for about 5 min. in a saute pan with 1 T. unsalted butter. Softened them just slightly enough to come out perfect after baking. YUM!",

                "reviewBody": "I've tried a bunch of apple pie recipes searching for THE ONE and I've finally found it! This recipe is perfect! The filling has just the right amount of sweetness and spice and the streusel makes a yummy cookie-like topping. For those of you having issues with how much flour to add every batch of apples is different so the amount you need will vary from pie to pie. The best way is to coat your freshly cut apples with about 1-2 tbs of lemon juice and 1/4 c sugar let sit in a colander for 15-20 minutes and the excess juices will run off. If your apples are really juicy you will need more flour if they are on the dry side you can use less. If you want you can do this over a bowl and save the juices to reduce and mix back into the pie before it bakes or use as a glaze on top. I used two heaping tablespoons in mine and it was perfect. Also when using flour as your pie thickener it's very important that the filling come to a BOIL! If it's not vigorously bubbling the flour will not thicken properly; your pie will be runny and you will still have that \"flour-y\" taste. And remember the pie needs to cool for at least a few hours so the juices solidify before you cut it. Even the best made pie will be runny if you cut into it right away.",
