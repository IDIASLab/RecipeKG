After a couple cups, I figured out the problem.  The ingredients are just fine (actually, as another review suggested, I added some pudding mix to it), but the instructions were a little off.  It tastes the best with 4 tablespoons instead of three, so I'll be sure to suggest that when I give it to people.  Other than that, it tastes as if I had made up a pot of hot chocolate from scratch!  Much better than store bought.",
