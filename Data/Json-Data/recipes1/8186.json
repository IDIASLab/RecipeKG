I used some of the previous reviews to tweak it slightly: I used boneless/skinless breasts (6), and I added 6 TBSP corn syrup to make it a little sweeter, as the lemon is very tart. I cooked it for about 35 minutes covered, and uncovered for 10. When the chicken was cooked, I transferred the juices to a saucepan, and thickened it over med/high heat with some cornstarch. I served it with a simple California salad and rolls to sop up the extra sauce. Absolutely wonderful, this is on my weekly menu for sure!",
