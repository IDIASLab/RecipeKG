I did have a few problems with leaking cheese and after reading other reveiws I coated each stick 2-3 times with egg and breadcrumb. After baking them at 400 degrees for 8 minutes the crust wasn't very hard so I let the cheese harden then put them in at 425 for another 5 minutes or so. With these changes the recipe turned out great!",

The breading held it's shape & everything but some of the cheese leaked out. I think that next time I will use the whole egg instead of just the white & see what happens then.
