I ended up rolling these out as flat as I could and then using an upside-down cup to cut circles so they would all look consistent. Then after filling with strawberry preserves I crimped them shut with a fork. The dough seemed a bit crumbly at first but got easier to work with once I started rolling them out a bit. While cooking some of the jelly seeps out and hardens on the cookie sheet (but can be easily cleaned off with very hot water). In the end they ended up tasting like mini strawberry pies. They have a nice appearance for giving as gifts.",

It's such a small amount of jam that when the cookies puff during baking there isn't much filling in comparison. I refrigerated the dough overnight but needed to let it warm up for quite a while before I could work with it. Like others I rolled the dough out and cut it with a 3\" round cutter. I made some cookies with apricot jam and some with homemade cherry-raspberry jam. I used a little water to help the dough stick to itself and pressed it with the tines of a fork to help seal in the jam. Some still leaked out but it did help. This is a very tender flaky cookie. They are best eaten the first day or two. I haven't had the opportunity to try freezing them. I would like to try using a chunkier fruit filling in the future. Tip: If rolling out the dough for cutting roll between two sheets of waxed paper lightly dusted with flour. This makes the job much simpler!",
