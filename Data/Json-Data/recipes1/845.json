A couple of notes for \"first-timers\"... make sure you read the Cheesecake Tips section of this board.  This recipe doesn't tell you some of the cheesecake fundamentals like 1) Make sure your cream cheese is at room temp before you start  2)Your batter should be smooth and silky.  If it is lumpy your cheesecakes will turn out badly.  If needed, throw the batter in a blender/food processor to get rid of the lumps  3)You do NOT want to wait for your cheesecakes to crack before removing them from the oven.  They are done before they crack, when the center is still soft.\r\n\r\nAfter I learned these lessons, the recipe turned out well!",

I have altered the recipe to make white chocolate raspberry, carmel, peanut butter, turtle, and strawberry.  I am getting very creative w/flavors and will someday have a list to rival the Cheesecake Factory! : )\n\nI used fresh fruit for the raspberry and then preserves for the strawberry.  I find the ones w/fruit take about twice as long to bake.  The peanut butter has probably been the biggest hit out of all the flavors!  I just made the plain, peanut butter, turtle, and strawberry for a wedding reception (I made about 200 of them).  They were gobbled up within moments!  This recipe is definately a keeper!  \n\nSome tips- \nI've used both the little mini muffin pans and normal muffin pans.  I prefer mini, but I think it really helps if you use muffin liners.  I used a water bath the 2nd time I used this recipe, and am not sure if it made a difference, except by making my oven feel 4 times hotter!  I'd like to think it made a difference, so I will do it again.  Garnishing these little bite sized beauties really sets them off and it's also very fun!  You can't go wrong w/this recipe.  \n\nPlease let me know if anyone wants details on the specific flavors I used and how I made them.  Happy baking!",
