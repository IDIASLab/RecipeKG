I did a few changes such as no pimentos and used sweet instead of dill pickles.  I have even told some friends about it who now want the recipe.  I thought the cheese sauce made it, but the kids were not fond of it.  ",

I think the dough can be rolled much thinner than 1/4 inch though and that'd help you get more filling in the ratio. If I make this again for my family I will just make it into one large pie so it's quicker.",

The tuna mixture needs a lot of tweaking and there's just too little of it to justify calling this an entr\u00e9e. Also the egg in the mixture makes it too runny to have easy assembly. The cheese doesn't need a double-boiler just use low heat and whisk it constantly.",

I wonder if the egg should have been hard boiled as I had egg running all over the place. And my experience with cheese sauces makes me wonder why the double boiler and what ever is the final 1 cup of cheese for in the ingredient list. All in all this was a pleasant slightly festive way to make a tuna dinner. Will make again to try to work out some of the questions. Perhaps the poster can make comments.",
