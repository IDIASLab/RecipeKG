I used to live in Mexico and this recipe isn\u2019t really authentic at all plus it is very bland.  \n\nAfter making it once exactly as written, I made it a 2nd time with the following changes:\n- Substitute jalapeno pepper for Serrano, and use 3-4 serrano peppers.\n-Boil raw, bone in chicken breasts with just enough water to cover chicken, a tsp of chicken bouillon per cup of water, few garlic cloves minced, \u00bd onion\n-Once chicken is no longer pink, take out of broth and set aside.  Meanwhile - \n- Sautee tomatillos, Serrano peppers, 3 garlic cloves, \u00bd medium onion in pan with 1/3-1/4 cup chicken broth you have from cooking your chicken.  After the tomatoes have turned slightly brown on all sides, puree in blender with 1 tsp of oregano.\n\nOnce sauce is pureed to the consistency you like, take chicken off bone and spoon sauce over chicken. Since the chicken broth will be salty from the boullion, I let each person salt according to their own taste. I like to top with cilantro, queso fresco, lettuce, and a bit of lime juice.  I eat it with fresh corn tortillas so it is almost more like enchiladas but it tastes much better than the original recipe.",

Just wanted to add another note I used my left over to make enchiladas and they were awesome! I shredded the chicken and kept the cooked sauce with the shredded chicken. Filled the tortillas with the mixture topped them with the raw mole and then cheese and baked them! Ahhh Heaven:)",

I have never worked with tomatillos before but have a Hispanic produce stand readily available and they weren't too hard to come by. Too bad they don't carry the cheese because I absolutely could not find the Oaxacan Cheese. Anyway I loved this dish! The best part of it is the contrast between the cooked and fresh verde mole. I used a shredded Mexican blend cheese and halved the recipe with 3 chicken tenderloins. There was more than enough verde mole for that much chicken and probably will be enjoyed on chips. Hubs said it is a keeper! Thanks Avon for the recipe and for opening my eyes to what I might have missed out on!",

I can't find tomatillos so I read that a sub would be salsa verde (that was still Greek to me) so I found a recipe on here Mexican salsa verde and I had all the ingredients. I used celery in place of cilantro-sorry had to-and I served it with ww pasta topped with salsa avacado some of the sauce from the chicken black olives and bit of shredded cheese. So good. I wanted more but had to leave the kitchen. Good thing I took pics so I could hop on the computer to review this and refrain from seconds. Will make again Gitano says I should be able to find canned tomatillos I might try that but the fresh sub was good too",
