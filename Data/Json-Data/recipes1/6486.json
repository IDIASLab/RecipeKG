I only used real whipping cream for the 1/4 cup you mix into the melted chocolate chips. The only thing I would change next time would be to use fewer chocolate chips. It was a bit too heavy in the stomach as is. Next time I'd reduce the chocolate chips to maybe 1 cup or 3/4 cup instead of 1.5 cups. Other than that a beautiful and delicious cake. I'll be making it again.",

Like another reviewer mentioned -- I recommend letting your cream warm to room temperature before adding it to the chocolate -- or simply heat it in the microwave for a few seconds to warm. This will prevent the chocolate from seizing. One other note when I chilled the filling for 30 minutes it was way too stiff to spread -- but maybe my refrigerator was too cold. In any case I would skip that step next time. All in all this was a wonderful recipe and I received nothing but rave reviews!",

Hazelnuts are kind-of pricey and this was a tester cake so I used toasted almonds instead. For frosting I looked at the \"cool whipped frosting\" recipe from this site but used 8 oz. of fresh cream instead of Cool Whip. I also would recommend if using that frosting recipe that you only use HALF the amount of the pudding mix and that you buy instant WHITE CHOCOLATE pudding rather than vanilla. The vanilla gave my cake a yellow-ish tint that I did not like...next time I will use a classic white buttercream with this cake instead....",

I didn't have any problem with letting the filling chill completely before spreading it as some reviewers mentioned. Also be aware that if you make the frosting as written (NOT with Cool Whip) it won't be sweet just creamy/nutty. It can be a nice touch to offset all the sweetness of the cake and filling but just be aware of that. Taste a little while you're whipping the cream and if you don't like it as is add a pinch or two of white sugar until it's just sweet enough. I left mine as is and feel it's a nice contrast especially since I don't like super-sweet frostings but it also would have been good with a small pinch of sugar.",

Instead of using the whipping cream for the topping I folded a teaspoon of almond extract into a tub of Cool Whip with the chopped nuts and it was delicious. One tip is to warm the whipping cream to room temperature before wisking it into the melted chocolate chips (wisking very fast and adding the cream very slowly) this helped keep it smooth. Adding the cream while it was cold made the chocolate sieze up a little and made more of a ganache than a smooth mixture. However I still crumbled it into the whipped cream and got gooey chocolate bits inside the cream...... YUM! I almost liked it better that way than when I got it right with the second cake!;)",
