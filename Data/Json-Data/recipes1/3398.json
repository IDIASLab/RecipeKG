Instead of pie crust I crushed up butter cookies and made a crumb base which went really well with the filling. I didn't use any frosting as I didn't have any on hand and the flavour was still great. Maybe the filling wasn't as fluffy as it would have been otherwise. I found the filling sweet enough as it was so I can't imagine how much sweeter it would have been with the frosting added. Thanks so much for this recipe - it's definitely a keeper!",

It's delicate pastry was complemented by the tart of the pineapple although I must say it was quite tingly on the tongue. I do have one suggestion for those brave enough to attempt this dish - add some real champagne (about 2 cups) for a real KICK to the dish! Much more amusing to your dinner guests! HAW HAW!",
