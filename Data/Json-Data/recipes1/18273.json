While cooking them I added about 1/4 tsp. California style garlic salt with parsley. I had button mushrooms in the fridge to use up so I added about 6 of those sliced while sauteing the onions. Waited until right towards the end to add the garlic clove so as not to burn & get bitter. When this was done I tasted it & it still needed a little more of the California style garlic salt with parsley so I added about 1/4 tsp. more. I also added about 1/2 tsp. coarse ground black pepper. I cooked my noodles in water with chicken bouillon in it for added flavor & then drained them & tossed them with about 2 Tbsp. butter. My husband doesn't like noodles but he loved this!",
