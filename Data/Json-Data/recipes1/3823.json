It rose over the top of the pan and oozed down the sides. I had to scrape it out to control the burning. In 13 years of using bread machines this is the first time I have seen this. The bread tasted good and had a nice crust to it where it touched the pan. I used 2/3 cup of pecans instead of macadamia nuts. The pecans gave the bread a slightly characteristically bitter flavor.",

I cut back a bit on the water due to that. And I veganized it by subbing grapeseed oil for the butter and flaxseed/water for the egg (I didn't have any eggs so I figured what the heck). I also used an unprocessed cane sugar rather than white sugar and added 2 or 3 tablespoons of grapeseed flour for some of the bread flour. And I added a bit of vanilla paste to round our the flavor. I did have to add about 4 cups or so of flour. It smelled great when baking and the finished product tastes great. Toasted with PB for breakfast...yummy!! Oh and I did this by hand rathr than a bread machine...just threw everything into my KA stand mixer.",

Use the instructions that came with your machine as a guide. I had to rescue the partially baked dough and dump it onto a cookie sheet to finish baking it in a conventional oven. So it came out as a kind of large ugly lump. It tasted pretty good though! It was a little underdone so I recommend careful probing with a cake tester. Some other reviewers noted the lack of banana flavor - my bread had an attractive and subtle banana undertone. I liked it but I guess everyone's taste is different.",
