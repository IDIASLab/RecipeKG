The frozen loaf worked out fine--very much like buyign frozen bread.  I don't know if this made a difference, but some recipes call for rising in the refrigerator for 12+ hours before baking.  Due to my time constraints, I put the unfrozen loaf in the loaf pan and refrigerated for 24 hours before baking.  I let it rise on the counter for 2 hours before baking Texture was great and the flavor was awesome.",

I added about a tablespoon of italian seasoning to the dough and about a 1/2 cup of sundried tomatoes taking the suggestions of another reviewer. In addition to that I used the oil from the sundried tomatoes to grease the bowl and the top of the dough before letting it rise. I make an herbed butter to go with the bread and it's delicious! The best part for my husband and I were the grilled cheese sandwiches I made the second day. Spread a little herbed butter on one side each of two slices of bread. Make sandwiches using a couple of slices of pepperjack cheese. Grill the sandwiches on the buttered sides until the bread is toasted and the cheese is melty. The pepperjack cheese makes the flavors of the butter and the bread burst! I'd like to serve it next time with a nice tomato soup. My husband's mouth has been watering for more ever since!",
