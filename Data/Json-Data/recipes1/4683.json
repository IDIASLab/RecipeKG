I served it with my Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone raved about how delicious it was.  I found a couple of problems with the recipe, though.  In the ingredients list it calls for 1/3 c. softened butter.  Then in the directions that amount is changed to 1/4 c.  I had already measured out the 1/3 c. so I went ahead and used that much.  It was fine.  I think it works best when the margarine is melted rather than just softened, too.  The baking dish called for in the recipe is 9x13. I believe that is much too large for a single recipe.  I used one that is 8x11 and it was the ideal size.",

That meant I only used one sweet potatoe and I cubed it before boiling it so I was able to have mashed sweet potato in less than 15 minutes. Also I added a little orange peel zest to the mixture. I put the entire thing in a glass pie plate and it made the presentation beautiful. The topping crunched up perfectly and this was easy to make while managing my main course.",

I like to heat them up a bit for easier mixing in the microwave just until warm (but not necesary). Add 1/4-1/2 cup sugar 2 eggs 1/3 cup butter at room temperature but can use right out of frige if potatoes are warm. Also add 1 tsp. vanilla ext. and 1tsp. salt.( no liquids.) Blend in mixer till smooth. Topping: 1/2 c. melted margarine 1/2-3/4 c. brown sugar(light) Depending on how sweet you want it and 1 c chopped nuts. I put in a 10 inch deep dish pie plate (not necesary to grease dish) Bake 350 for 25 min. Everyone loves this dish. My kids won't touch sweet potatoes so I don't know how kid freindly this is but anyone who likes sweet potatoes and nuts will love this. It is a sweet vegetable and like a dessert but I would never serve as a dessert. There are different versions of this recipe you can't really go wrong with them. Thanks Cindy!",
