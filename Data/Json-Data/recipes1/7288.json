I used beef broth instead of water and bouillon cubes and used more carrot and potatoes than called for (I used small red potatoes cut into half). I also used low sodium mushroom soup. I would like to add that different slow cookers work at different temperatures. I have two slow cookers and one cooks at a MUCH higher temperature on both low and high setting than the other.  I would keep this in mind when setting up your cooking times. The lady that wrote this recipe has a cooker that will either be slower or faster than the one you have. As for the finished product.... Mine was outstanding! I let each person added salt and pepper to their own taste after it was cooked... It's much easier to control the amount of salt and pepper at the table than to guess how much it will take when you start cooking. After cooking on low for nine hours, my roast (2.8 pounds) was so tender I could cut it with a fork. Both my wife and I commented how tasty it turned out. This is an easy and very tasty recipe for pot roast and I recommend anyone likes a good pot roast!",

As far as my experience with the recipe, I tweaked it a little for my own taste. I used broth instead of buillion and water, and I used a lot of it because I love the soupy gravy. I added the potatoes in half way through cooking so they wouldnt be mush,  they were perfect! Added probably more veggies than recommended and some extra seasoning (garlic, tonys). But overall I just loved it! thanks for the recipe!",

Beforehand, I made slits in the roast and put in slices of garlic, then browned the roast on all sides before putting it in the slow cooker. I also added a bay leaf, ground pepper and 2/3 cups water and wished I added more because the \"juice\" was so good! Perfect for soaking up with freshly baked bread!",

I prepared it according to the directions with the following modifications: I sliced 3 carrots instead of using baby carrots, replaced the onion with a package of dry onion soup mix, and used 3/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup.  I cooked it on low for a little over 8 hours.  The meat was so tender and so full of flavor.  Plus, it passed the ultimate test: my husband loved it and even had seconds!  Next time I'm going to add a can of cream of mushroom soup to make a thicker gravy.  Great recipe!",
