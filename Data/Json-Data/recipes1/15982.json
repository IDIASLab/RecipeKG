Even more startling Hubs hates polenta and he hates Parmesan cheese. I made him eat this anyway - he said I could make this anytime and exactly as I made it tonight. The combination of water milk and chicken broth? Excellent. (For the record I like my polenta creamy so I skipped the step of baking it)",
