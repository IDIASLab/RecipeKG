I put in only 3 eggs, then instead of 15 oz of pumpkin, I put in a 30 oz can of pumpkin pie mix (I use Libby's).  I then add an additional teaspoon of pumpkin pie seasoning to the flour mix, in addition to the cinnamon.  I've got my baking time down to 27 minutes in my oven, which is just the point where the toothpick comes out clean for the first time.  Then for the frosting, I add 8oz cream cheese, and double the rest of the frosting ingredients.  PERFECT!",

It says it's very moist.  And for those who claim I 'stole' the recipe from Paula Dean, check the dates.  This was posted over 15 years ago, long before Paula Dean was ever heard of on TV.
