Since I added more I added more broth and used chicken broth instead. I used basmati rice and smooth peanut butter. I also topped it with sour cream and some cilantro.

On a whim, I added 1/4 tsp. of chili powder instead of the 1/8 it would have called for, and I did closer to a half cup of peanut butter. The extra chili powder was excellent. The extra peanut butter was ok, but what it calls for would be fine too. The only complaint I have is that I need about double the time to get the rice cooked-- 15 minutes wasn't nearly enough time.

I was afraid it would be too sweet (I usually buy natural nut butters) but it was fine. I might add a pinch more chili powder next time. Since I was using brown rice that normally takes 45-50 minutes to cook I cooked it for about 30 before tossing it into the soup. Next time I will probably up the rice to at least 3/4 cup if not a cup. I did add the sour cream but it is delicious when served alone too.",

I did make a few changes. I added a chopped jalepeno with the peppers; used tricolored peppers... mine turned out a little paler than the photo-- not the prettiest color so I added a little bit of tomato sauce to darken it-- which I found improved the flavor. Even brought some to a friend from Ghana-- she thought this was tasty and very authentic (although she is used to creamy peanut butter herself.)

However, like many, I did make my own changes to give it more flavor. I added cinnamon, cloves, and crushed red pepper and increased the chili powder significantly.  I also doubled the garlic just because I felt like it and added thinly sliced zucchini for more bulk.  I found that the soup was very versatile and handled the changes and additions very well. Have fun with this recipe and make it your own.  Oh, and the flavors definitely do get more intense with time.  Lovely!",
