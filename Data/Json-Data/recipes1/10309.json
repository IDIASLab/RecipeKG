Markypost was right: You won't be wiping up oodles of sauce with your garlic bread when you make this dish--it's just not THAT kind of pasta. I agree with other reviewers that you'll need to add some more olive oil than the recipe calls for, or else it will tend to be \"dry.\" I throw in a few red chili pepper flakes with the anchovy and garlic saute, for a bit of zing. Not everyone will agree with me, but I prefer to use panko (Japanese) bread crumbs, because they're a bit coarser, and then I like to fry them in the hot oil for a minute before turning off the heat and adding the parsley. I enjoy the slight crunchy texture this adds to the final product. Parmesan might make this dish too salty for some folks, but I can't imagine pasta without it, and that's why a huge handful of fresh parsley is so important--it cuts right through the salt and sort of lightens up the overall flavour. This tastes strong, but not fishy, makes an excellent side dish, cheap and easy to prepare, be brave and give it a try!",

This dish should be pleasantly oily with a light, anchovie flavor mixed with the buttery, garlicky breadcrumbs.  The only difference in how my mom makes it and this recipe is that she uses linguine instead of spaghetti.  Small point, I know, but the ingredients seem to cling better to the linguine.",
