He also states that for the two servings you add just enough of the cheese sauce to incorporate one cup of cooked pasta and save the remainder of the sauce for another time. I made the recipe using regular chips but otherwise followed the topping recipe as written. Everyone enjoyed it very much and declared the recipe a \"keeper\". Won't make it often because of the high caloric count but it's a great \"treat\" recipe.",
