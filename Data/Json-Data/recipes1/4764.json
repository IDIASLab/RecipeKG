Seasoned the butter too with garlic salt and pepper. I added the half and half the last 20 minutes of cooking so it would not currdle as it had with another review. I also sauted the mushrooms along with a yellow onion and a green bell pepper in butter then added them the last 15 minutes. This is a great recipe. I will be making again and again!!
