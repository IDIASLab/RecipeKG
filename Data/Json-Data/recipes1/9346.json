Double the sauce ingredients (but omit the honey) and add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. Add 1/2 tsp garlic powder and some red pepper flakes (to taste) to the sauce.

Others recomended bib lettuce but my husband prefered the crunch of the iceberg lettuce (I agree) so I'll go back to that next time. It didn't take that long to make (with a food processor) and was soooo good! Next time I'll try making the ginger lemonade with it.",

I thought to myself, \"why omit the cherries, when this dish is called CHERRY CHICKEN WRAPS?\".  The Cherry Craisins were so easy and quick to use, verses real cherries, and the frustration that goes with \"pitting\" them.  The result was yummy, and the presentation was awesome!  My husband and oldest daughter LOVED them, and want me to make them again.  Great summer dish, or anytime dish!\r\nThanks a lot for sharing this one! This will be a family favorite.",

In reading the other reviews I had to laugh - some have omitted the cherries! Why bother making chicken CHERRY lettuce wraps if you omit the cherries? Sorry - I really like cherries and this is the best meal I've had in a long time! Healthy lots of flavor simple although somewhat time consuming with the pitting of the cherries. One note about the lettuce - make sure you buy a hearty lettuce. The red leaf was way too thin and flimsy to hold the bundle. I ended up just making a salad of it - which was fine too. I'd pick Romaine or Butter lettuce - something with a stiffer leaf. Thanks Barry for an awesome recipe!",

I cut the recipe in half used frozen/thawed rotissirie chicken (sauteed it in the oil & ginger for a couple of minutes to infuse it w/ flavor) I used ginger-in-a-tube (I added extra) & I used finely minced red onion instead of the green onions. I decreased the carrots some & I used red leaf lettuce. Bibb lettuce might make it more convenient to eat but we both liked the slight crunch from the leaf lettuce. Even though I cut the recipe in half & decreased the carrots I made the full recipe of sauce...I'm glad because I think it would have been too dry & not nearly as flavorful w/out it. I also made this up a couple of hours ahaed & kept it in the fridge...I think it needs time for the flavors to meld. I didn't take a pic thinking that there would be leftovers & I could do it the next day in natural light but we ate it all! LOL With a glass of white zin this was perfect for a hot summer night...thanks Barry!",
