Although I did not make the pound cake in the recipe I used the lemon mint whipped cream and the fruit per recipe and was able to use my cake trimmed of it's dark sides. The recipe doesn't really require much cake. Everyone has enjoyed it and asked for the recipe. It is light and refreshing! Perfect for summer!",

And, even though I left the cake in for the least amount of time, it burned.  It was inedible.  I ended up baking a pound cake with a boxed mix and topping it with the recipe's whipped topping and fruit mix which were very good.",
