I took the suggestion of another reviewer- I cut the butter into a yellow cake mix with a pastry cutter, added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and sprinkled the mixture over the peaches.  I sprinkled a generous amount of cinnamon on the peaches first.  This time it tunred out perfect!  It still was sweet and could even get away with cutting the brown sugar back to 1/4 cup.  Using the pastry cutter with the butter and cake mix made all the difference in the world.  The crust was yummy and the filling was more solid- not a runny mess like the first one I made.  A keeper!!",

No need for additional water; peaches were juicy enough. I used a white cake mix and mixed in 1/2 cup brown sugar. I used a FROZEN stick of butter and grated it into the cake mix and mixed together with a pastry cutter. After placing it on the peaches I sprinkled a little more cinnamon and nutmeg on top and baked for about an hour and 10 min. It was delicious! Thanks for the recipe Brenda! Can't wait to try this with apples this fall!",

Because of complaints about being too sweet I poured peaches/juice into pan then sprinkled 1/4 cup of brown sugar 1 tsp of Cinammon 1 tsp of Nutmeg on them. I mixed in a 1/2 tsp of Cornstarch to prevent the runniness some complained of and it was not runny at all. For topping I used Duncan Hines Butter Golden cake mix added a cup of Oats more cinammon nutmeg and brown sugar. I used a stick of room temperature butter and mixed with my hands crumbling it on top of the peaches. Baked for 40 minutes and it came out perfect! Not too sweet at all. Personally I'd like more peach so I'd add a 3rd can next time. The topping made so much that I have a 2nd one in the oven using 3 cans of Apricots. Smells wonderful!",
