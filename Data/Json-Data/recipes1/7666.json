I didn't hear much as far as rave reviews which I did for some of the other dishes I brang so they rate an okay. Visually they are not very appealing. My brother thought they looked like potatoe salad rolled up in ham. My dad thought that was what they were. I thought they looked like deviled egg filling. I did make a few changes because the other reviewers complained about the mess and didn't have trouble with the mess issue. I cut the pickles down to two. I thought the pickle taste was still very strong. I decreased the mustard to about 1 tablespoon. I left the chives out because I forgot to buy some and added about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. I put about 1/4 cup of filling on each slice of ham and ended up with about 8 rolls. They were not really that messy. I may make again just because they were so easy. I will have to find a way to adjust the filling so it doesn't look like potatoe salad though.",

To avoid the filling's 'potato salad' look other reviewers complained about you could actually keep the ingredients separate and layer them...even leaving the pickle spears whole and placing them length-wise on the tortilla before you roll it and having the pickle in the center of your roll-up.
