From other reviews I added 3 beef cubes, more hamburger and some other things in my cupboard to this basic recipe:  a can of diced tomatoes, a can of black beans instead of pork and beans, package of frozen corn.  AND salt and pepper--too bland before adding that.\nAfter browning hamburger (1.5 lbs) with celery and onions, I put it all in the crock pot and let it simmer on high for about 5 hours.  During taste tests throughout the day, I didn't like it and thought it was too \"taco-tasting\" because of the taco seasoning packet, but when it cooks long enough and blends all together it is awesome.  We've had 3 days of leftovers with it and I can't wait to get hungry again so I can have some more!",

It turned out great! I don't even like most of the ingrediants and I loved it as well! Thanks for this one.",

It was ready in under an hour and tasted like I had taken all day to make it. It would also be a great slow-cooker recipe. Everyone in my family enjoyed it.
