I was under the assumption they would turn out looking like Cathedral windows but they didn't at all. They are just a small round yellowish cookie with bits of fruit and don't look like stained glass or anything. Too bad---that is the main reason I made them. And although they taste good they were not gobbled up by the family like most Christmas baking. It is January 3rd and I still have lots of them left.",
