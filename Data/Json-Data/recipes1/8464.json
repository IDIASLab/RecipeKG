To solve this problem, I added half a can of tomato paste, and this made it perfect.  I also added just a little extra chili powder because I wanted it to be a little spicier.  Because I didn't have stewed tomatoes, I used canned diced tomatoes instead.  They were just as good and gave the chili a nice flavor.  I have already made this for dinner twice, and I plan on making it a staple in my recipe collection.  It's great served with a portion of baguette.",
