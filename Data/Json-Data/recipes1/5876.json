                "reviewBody": "I am a vegetarian and really enjoy this dish. I have been making it for several years now. I only make minor adjustments. I usually skip the leeks and shallots and substitute with onions. Leeks and shallots are great, but I don't keep those items on hand, and they make the recipe quite costly. I do use 2 tablespoons of tamari for a little extra flavor. I also suggest extra zucchini, mostly to give the dish more contrast in colors. I like to use halved grape tomatoes. Some reviewers have mentioned that this dish does not taste like chicken. That is correct. Tempeh does not taste like a meat. It has its own texture and takes on the flavor of what it is cooked with. You have to like tempeh to enjoy this dish. It is a staple in a vegetarian's diet. One last comment. I do not see how this dish would serve 6 people as the main course, and since it has tempeh, it is a main course dish. I would say it serves 3-4 as a main dish. Maybe I just have a heartier appetite, but that is how I see it. Update: August 2014: I continue to enjoy making and eating this dish. I have found that adding mushrooms is a nice addition. I recently learned that shitake mushrooms have great health benefits, so I decided to use them in this recipe and was pleased with the results. This dish can be adjusted to your preferences in so many ways. Don't be afraid to experiment. The recipe as listed is awesome, but feel free to make it your own based on what you have on hand.",

Tempeh shouldn't be enjoyed as a meat substitute but rather on its own merits. With that in mind I think that this was a really yummy dish. It's nothing like chicken or any other meat but it's a very good tempeh dish. I ramped up the spice a bit but I tend to do that on everything I make. My husband also loves this dish; he requested that I add it to my \"frequently cooked\" list!",

                "reviewBody": "Interesting dish. I never use tempeh without seasoning it first. Maybe this could help others. In a bowl I put approx. 2 T. olive oil and about 4-5 T. Bragg's with some seasoning. Use what you like. I used some Goya Adobo and cumin but you could use garlic powder etc. I then crumbled the tempeh into the bowl mixed it up and set it aside until it was time to add to the veggies. This lets the seasoning permeate the tempeh and give it some much needed taste. Like a previous reviewer said don't overcook the veggies. I found I didn't need to saute anything for 5 minutes before adding the next set of ingredients. I doubled the zucchini used an entire red pepper and instead of sherry I used vegetable broth. This made quite a lot and I served it with mashed potatoes for everyone and noodles for me (vegan). It tasted really good! I will mix the leftovers tonight with brown rice and put them in some peppers and make stuffed peppers.",
