Excellent especially with whole grain pasta.",

Really quick and easy but next time will double the sauce and I'll cook the pasta the full time before mixing with the sauce. I topped the dish with seasoned bread crumbs. I halved the recipe which was sufficient for two people with a side of something. I'll give this another go soon with the above considerations. I appreciate the recipe.",
