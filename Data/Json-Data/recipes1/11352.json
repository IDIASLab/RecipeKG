My chops were done long before the rice was and rather than overcook the meat we ate it with the rice slightly undercooked. The canned rice will prevent this and the \"sauce\" was a tad too thin. I'm hoping that next time it will be much creamier. Overall great home-cooked meal.",

I didn't think it was too salty but some might think it is. I added about 3/4 bag of frozen green beans over the canned mushrooms for color. I also used a half can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup as well as the 10.75oz. can of cr.mushroom soup. I added about 1/4c water to the soups before I poured it over the pork chops. I baked it at 350 degrees for about 1hr 45min and it turned out perfectly. My husband really enjoyed it. I'll probably be making this dish a lot. It's a really easy recipe for the working mother/wife. It reheats well also!",
