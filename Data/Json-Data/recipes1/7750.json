It was very sweet and very good. I don't like spicy food so I substituted regular pepper instead of cayenne and added a little garlic salt for flavor. It was a bit on the bland side but still absolutely delicious and complimented the delicate flavor of the lobster meat perfectly. A keeper recipe for sure.",
