I salted the cucumber slices lightly and let them sit on a clean teacloth for about 20 minutes. I also soaked the red onion slices in cold water for about 20 minutes. The soaking 'sweetens' the onion. Then I wrung the cucumbers out in a clean teacloth and patted the cucumber and onion dry.I like Bren's simple rice vinegar and pepper for a dressing or a spritz of good balsamic vinegar. (This soaking method is always used for cucumber sunomono when preparing Japanese salads.) I always 'sweeten' red onion if it's being eaten raw. This is perhaps time-consuming no snap but I enjoy the results. It's worth the effort.",
