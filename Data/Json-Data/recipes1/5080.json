Instead of frying, bake the strips on 350 degrees for 30 minutes or until the center is white.  Also, I used skim mild instead of buttermilk.  Spray the cookie sheet with fat free butter flavored spray and voila! very low fat tenders!  If the powder looks like it's not baked golden, don't woory, if the chicken is done, so is the breading.  I also added a teaspoon each of rosmary, thyme and pepper.",

I was worried that they wouldn't measure up, but he thought they were quite good for homemade!!  The only change I made was that after I shook them in the breadcrumb mixture, I dipped them in a beaten egg and RECOATED them in the leftover breadcrumbs. This made for a thicker, crunchier coating and a MUCH more tender bite to the chicken. (i only know that because i ran out of the crumbs before I could recoat the last 3 so I fried them with only a single dip...they were noticably more chewy) Over all an awesome recipe!!  Will do it again!! :)",

I also \"double dipped\" them, repeating with a second coating of the buttermilk mixture and then again in the crumb mixture. These are great with barbecue sauce or Ranch dressing. Good recipe Janet, thanks for sharing it! Update Dec. 2, 2013: This time I made these with Panko bread crumbs and didn't bother to \"double dip.\"  Equally as delicious as the first time I made them.",

Note that if your oil is very hot, as it should be, it should only take a few minutes per side to cook the breasts; otherwise they will get tough and absorb more grease.",

I also double dipped as many reviewers had suggested with egg first then dredged in the flour/breadcrumb mixture and repeated. They fried easily without breaking apart and my oil looked like it had hardly been used after I was done.  I will use this recipe again and again.  Thanks!",
