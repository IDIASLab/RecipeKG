I have grown peanuts for most of my life. I think I know just a wee bit about both cooking and about peanuts. 1. All ovens do NOT reach the same temperature according to the indicator be it digital or manual. USE a \"calibrated\" oven thermometer to be sure of the correct temperature. 2. There are numerous varieties of peanuts which vary in size. They also vary in the amount of \"dryness\" with which you are beginning. 3. Read the directions for the recipes THREE times before you begin to cook ANYTHING. 4. Follow the directions before you even consider changing the recipe. Just a few words from the ancient cook.",
