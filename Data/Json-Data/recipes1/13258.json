To add some variety (rather than having two identical loaves) I added some thawed frozen blueberries to the batter for the smaller loaf. Very nice addition! I also added water to the powdered sugar to make a drizzle. Both loaves needed every bit of 30 minutes to bake plus a little more. This is a great recipe for those in-the-clutch breakfast situations in which unexpected guests have stayed the night. All ingredients on hand and it goes together quickly.",

                "reviewBody": "There were a few problems with this recipe. The baking time was way off for starters. 20-30 minutes for a 9x5 loaf? No way. I did check it at 30 minutes but it was still liquid in the middle. I baked it for an additional 15 and it was nice and moist but even a bit gooey at the bottom. The outside was a little dark at this point as well. The amount of sugar in this recipe is escessive. I cut each type of sugar by 1/4 cup and it was still very sweet. I opted to skip the powdered sugar because of this. This cake did sink in the middle as noted by another reviewer (see my photo). I'm not sure why others had a problem with the pan size. Perhaps their loaf pans are the smaller 8x4. I have both sizes and made sure to use the 9x5. There was no danger of overflowing the pan. I'm sure it would easily have accomodated the 1/2 cup of sugar I left out. Possibly these reviewers added a large amount of raisins. I did not. In short if you make this recipe cut back on the sugar make sure your loaf pan IS 9x5 bake 40 minutes before checking and leave out the raisins if you want it to fit in the pan. You'll end up with a tasty coffee cake that doesn't need the additional powdered sugar.",
