I used a cinnamin spice blend (which I believe has nutmeg in it) and I used more than recipe called for (I LOVE cinnamin).  I also added more rice since many reviewers stated it was too much like soup.  Since I am about 1800 feet above sea level and have a 20+ year old wall oven, I usually have to adjust my baking times, so I baked this a full hour.  I also used another reviewers hint and tested for \"doneness\" with a knife inserted in the middle.  The recipe turned out yummy, and I will keep it on hand for future rice leftovers.  \n\nI would be more apt to call it a rice pudding casserole...if you are thinking of pudding consistency, it isn't like that, and you will be disappointed. It seems to have more of a custard consistency when cooked completely through.\n\nIf you are hesitant to try this based on other reviews, please keep in mind that every recipe, even recipes from world famous chefs, need to be adjusted for personal taste. Would I give him a bad review simply because his dish was too spicy, no way!  \n\nI overlook poor ratings that are based on personal preference (such as \"too bland, too sweet, too spicy, too moist, too dry\".",

I do disagree with those who say it is too sweet...I think it would taste better with a little bit more sugar, but I have a HUGE sweet tooth!",
