I followed the recipe but after tasting I had to add garlic powder and salt and pepper and extra bacon bits for more flavor. DH said \"eh\" when I asked him how he liked it and he usually likes everything I make. Might try it with more egg and more bacon and seasonings. And besides it's not really \"fried\" since there is no butter or oil. It's more like sauteed in it's own water.",
