I might try less chocolate chips next time. I'm planning to make these to take to cookouts this summer.",

I used more peanut butter because i really wnated the peanut butter taste. It didn't help. The oatmeal overpowered the peanut butter. They were good though just not as peanut buttery as I would have liked. I did use semi-sweet chocolate chips and omitted the peanut butter frosing as suggested by other people here because it did seem too sweet for me when I read the recipe. They were very good but next time I will use milk chocoalte chips instead of semi sweet and I will use the frosting. BTW.... everyone who tried them absolutely loved them. My husband was glad to have something different and he liked them alot also. I will definitely make them again. I will make them again but make some minor changes next time.",

Don't think it hurt it any. I think the crust could have been a little sweeter but the measurments for the chocolate and PB glaze were right on. I love the combination of peanut butter and chocolate so I wasn't too disappointed with this one. Gonna keep looking.",
