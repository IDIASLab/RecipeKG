Empty the contents of the jar into a large bowl and mix until all the ingredients are well combined.  3. Using your hands work in 3/4 cup softened butter or margarine until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  4. Beat 1 egg with 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Work this into the flour mixture until well combined. Dough will be a little crumbly.  5. Shape dough into 1 inch sized balls and place 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet. Slightly flatten the balls with the palm of your hand. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 10 to 14 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove cookies to a rack to cool. Makes about 2 dozen cookies.\n"

Didn't work. The presentation is not cute. They tasted horrible. They had burnt bottoms and came out flat. It broke apart like dirt when bitten. I crushed some of the m&ms to be sure they fit in the cookie and left the rest whole. The outer shells of the peanut m&ms' were burnt crusty brown and you could taste the burnt 'toasted ' peanut in it's place. The whole thing tasted like a burnt peanut butter cookie. Sorry Verushka but I will not make these again. I still however gave the cookie-in-a-jar gift to my mother in law. Jan NotSoModest",
