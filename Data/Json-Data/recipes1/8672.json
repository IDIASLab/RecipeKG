When I told my boyfriend I was making it for dinner he wasn't too sure about pasta sauce over steak but after he tried it he couldn't believe the unique taste it had. The juices from the steak along with the wine totally change the flavor of the pasta sauce (I used chunky mushroom). I did cut the pasta sauce down to 1 1/2 cups and sauteed the garlic with the onions and served it over garlic mashed potatoes as suggested. It was WONDERFUL!! Thanks for the great recipe!",
