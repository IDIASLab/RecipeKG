I like cinnamon so I did not change any of the spices for me it was perfect. I cut the cream cheese and the powdered sugar in half (I had to heat the cream cheese in the microwave for 20 seconds to soften enough to blend with the sugar) Also I used 8 cups of sliced apples rather than 6. This way the filling was not so runny. I didn't have the turbinado sugar so I simply sprinkled the top crust with a bit of cinnamon and sugar. I used a deep dish pie plate and increased the baking time by 10 additional minutes due to the extra apples. It did not leak or run over on the cookie sheet at all. In fact it baked to perfection. This is not a pie to serve right out of the oven let it sit for about an hour to allow the filling to thicken. I'll be sure to make this again thanks for the recipe! This might also be a great pie to add a crumb topping too like a dutch applepie. A mix of oatmeal nuts flour brown sugar and butter would make a delicious addition to this yummy fall treat.",

I added more apples so that it would not turn out runny I also used carmel could not find the apple caramel ring due to being the wrong season of making it.I used 1/2 cup of carmel instead. Would make it again and it makes your kitchen smell wonderful too while in the oven..",

So either cut down on the filling a little bit or make your crust a little bit bigger & deeper which is what I do. Also set a small bowl of lemon juice out when you are slicing the apples & dip your fingers in it to rub on the slices to prevent browning. The spice & sugar ratio is just right for a double crust pie. This is the best tasting apple pie that I have ever had. My Dad called me & said that this was the best apple pie that he had ever had. My family & my in-laws all request it now for all of our get togethers including the holidays! I promise that it will be a big hit for you as well!",
