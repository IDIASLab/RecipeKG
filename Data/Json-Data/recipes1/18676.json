The guacamole seasoning mix was very easy to find in my store with all of the Ortega and Old El Paso products....I believe my mix was Ortega brand (blue packet). I used the whole lime and also the zest from the lime I did add some chili powder cumin dried corriander and some dried cilantro flakes to jazz this up. Mixture is definately \"wet\" due to the ground chicken I added about 1/4 c of plain bread crumbs to bind and make this easier to make into 4 nice burgers. Another tip is to lightly wet your hands with water before u make the patties....prevents the mixture from sticking to your hands. I made these in advance and placed in the fridge until dinner and then I grilled them on my Cuisinart indoor grill/griddle. Perfect and very tasty. Thanks!",

(I knew he wouldn't eat it he's very picky!!!) He was ranting and raving about that this is something you would get at a restaurant. Make sure you get the ciabatta bread. It is worth the extra. Also for those that complain about it being bland try adding a bit more of the guacamole packet try a different brand of the guacamole packet & add a bit more lime. The lime really pops the flavor! I've used a drier lime & could definitely tell the difference. An average lime yields 2 Tblsps juice. So now I always make sure I have a healthy Tblsp full of juice. We have made this recipe countless times. Getting ready to make again.:)",

I combined the guacamole seasoning onion cilantro and lime with 1 tablespoon of mayonaise then combine the mixture with the meat before forming the patties.
