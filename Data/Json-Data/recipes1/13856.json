My daughter decorated the cookies, putting two together with an \"I Love Mom & Dad\" theme (as seen in the photo).  \n\nI am not the best baker, an have minimal experience with rolling dough, but I learned three things from making this batch of cookies.\n\n1.  Put more than a thin layer of flour on the board before rolling the dough.  My first attempt had the dough sticking to the board because I used a light dusting of flour.\n2.  Brush off the flour from the bottom of the cookies before eating them.  They taste MUCH better that way.\n3.  I used the Reynolds Parchment Paper on the cookie sheet for the first time. I really like the results that I had.  The cookies didn't stick to the sheet and it didn't allow over cooking the bottom of the cookies.",

If you're making your house over several days time, then just make enough of the frosting for that day. ",

Soft and delicious. I will definatly be using this recipe for my gingerbread house. Oh and just so u know use Fancy Molasses for gingerbread. I didn't know that there are 5 types of molasses. I used cooking molasses for my first recipe and they turned out really dark and tasted too licorishy. Although cooking molasses is a mixture of fancy and blackstrap its way to strong for gingerbread but great for ginger snaps. Hope this helps. I used the royal icing recipe it turned out great. Ofcourse i added color to some and made them extra special.",
