Well, with a few changes it works out great.\n\nFirst, skip the extra sugar if your peaches are already sweet (most fresh ones are if they're ripe and ALL canned peaches are sweet enough).  If you're using another fruit, like blackberries or raspberries, then you'd need the extra sugar.  Remember, the cake mix has sugar, too.\n\nSecond, cream the cheese and cake mix together with a pastry cutter or a couple forks until it resembles a crumbly granola-type consistency.\n\nThird, melt the butter and pour it over with the liquid (use less liquid if your fruit is really juicy!)  Alternately, cream the butter in with the cheese and cake mix (see above).\n\nAnd last--cinnamon is not always appropriate if you are using this with a different fruit.  Other options that might sound better to you are nutmeg, vanilla bean specs or vanilla-flavored sugar.  Oh, and for a crunchy bonus, sprinkle the top with sliced almonds before baking.",

I mixed the cream cheese with the cake mix in a food processor just until mixture gets crumbly. After putting this mixture on the peaches (used fresh this time) I added the butter (melted) over the top of the cobbler.  My fiance said that was the best cobbler I have ever made. I give the credit to my food processor. This recipe is now 5 stars!",

I also cut the cream cheese into the cake mix with a pastry cutter (two knives work just as well) and then sprinkled the mixture on top of the peaches and cinnamon.

We use 1 large can peaches sliced in syrup (can use 2 cans, but I never do), 1 box yellow cake mix, 1 stick butter or margarine, 1/2 cup chopped nuts. No cream cheese. Pour peaches and juice into a 9x13 pan. Sprinkle dry cake mix evenly on top, add nuts over top. Cut marg. into thin slices and arrange on top so that it all gets covered when it melts. Bake 350 for 40-45 min. Maybe more depending on how many peaches you use, just watch. Top with cool whip when ready to serve. This may help with those who thought it was watery. It can't get any easier than this and it's such a nice and yummy dish to serve. Thanks Rebecca!",

We ate it hot from the oven with Breyer's French Vanilla Ice Cream. Sooooo good! I sure don't agree with the 2 other poor/bad reviews that DIDN'T recommend this?? Mebbe they just plunked it like a dump cake....? It isn't like that. (I don't understand how theirs came out that way either?) What I do recommend for folks using this recipe is to break up ALL of the \"chunks\" of cake mix with a butter knife as it sits on top of the peaches and h2o/sugar mix BEFORE adding the cream cheese & butter.... and sprinkle an extra 1/8 c. water on top of the finished cobbler (the butter & cream cheese part).... and by doing that we got the yummiest crust with no underdone portions. My son and hubby loved this -- our company raved over this one! Plus I was proud the peaches came from my own tree! Kudos to Rebecca for this one!",
