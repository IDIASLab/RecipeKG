Had my first with mustard but realized they are perfect even without toppings. My husband said we'd definitely make them again and I'd like to experiment with various sauces on them while cooking. Thank you for another no fail recipe Chef John!",

This a fun technique and the BBQ sauce glaze is really great!  Thank you for a fun dinner!  (Tip - watch the video!)",
