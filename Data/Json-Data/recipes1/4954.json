I seasoned my chicken w/ Paula Deen's house seasoning (garlic powder salt & pepper) after pounding & I added a tsp of hubby's hot sauce (roasted peppers onions & garlic) to the apricot mixture reserving some of the apricot sauce to dip with. Due to the pasty color of the chicken I broiled it for a couple of minutes after it was done to add some visual appeal. I put a smear of apricot sauce on the plate (take a big spoonful dump it at one end of the plate & then slide the spoon across the plate...creating a \"smear\") & sliced the roll-ups in half to reveal the beautiful pinwheel center. Garnished w/a sprig of fresh thyme. It looked great & tasted even better...thanks for the recipe!",
