Scarlett states that they will melt in your mouth and disappear...and boy do they ever!!! My husband hid a whole bowl of these from our 14-year-old to make sure that he would have some after the New Year!!! I had to make a double batch to make sure I had enough to put in all of the goodie baskets to give for the holidays!! This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper!! Thanks for a wonderful buttery nutty flavor melt in your mouth easy to make cookie!!! They are light and crispy but they stay soft and chewy at the same time. It is very difficult to describe the texture of these cookies without actually tasting them. Definitely NOT A COOKIE TO BE SHIPPED OVERSEAS!!!!! Hand deliver ONLY!!!!!! BUT make sure you make plenty and include the recipe or you will have people bugging you all year to be baking them more!! Qudos to Scarlett for a wonderful cookie recipe whether you call it a 'sugar' or a 'sandie' it makes no difference...it is a wonderful cookie of that there is NO DOUBT!!!!",

My mom even asked me for this recipe - what a compliment! Use dark brown sugar and mexican vanilla for sweeter flavor. I suggest baking one cookie sheet of cookies then spooning the rest (making rolls) in sheets of waxed paper. Place the rolls in gallon freezer bags in the freezer. Cut roll in sugar (even colored sugar for kids) and bake as needed. Thanks Scarlett for a definite keeper!",
