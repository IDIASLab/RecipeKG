It's possible that the thickness of the french fried onions just didn't agree with the soup and veggies mixed that made it taste that way but not for sure exactly. The stuffing mix...was what sank the boat. And here's why. 1.. I used the Savory Stove Top Stuffing mix Followed it to a T on how this recipe was written. I only changed stirring methods mixing the veggies and soup mix in a separate bowl before putting in the baking pan. I did the same when drizzing the butter on the stuffing mix to incorperated the stuffing & butter together then placed on top of the layer of fried onions. When baked...the stuffing looked dark harder then croutons and was just not tasty. I wondered if the butter was the down fall. And it was. After which I grabbed an unopened box of stuffing mix and read the directions on a basic stove top mix. 1-6oz box requires boiling 1 1/2 cups of water w/4TBSP of butter. Well this recipe requires 12oz of stuffing mix w/3 TBSP of melt butter & that does NOT cut it for the entire amount written. If the stuffing mix was put under the veggie mix the liquids from the soup could have moistened the stuffing and made it soft and tasteful. And/or mix the entire recipe all together could result in a soft hearty casserole too. But as it stands. Not worthy in making again in my kitchen. My apologies.",
