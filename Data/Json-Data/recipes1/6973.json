I looked in the freezer and found I had some ground beef so I searched for a recipe and this one sounded interesting. To my surprise I had all the ingriendients except for the green pepper so i just omitted it and it was great! Very flavorful and a cinch to make! Even if you hate to cook you can have a very nice meal in about 30 minutes that yoour family will enjoy! This is wonderful inthe winter because it is almost considered a stew. I also served this with fresh homemade corn bread!",

I cut some roasted corn off of one cob and added that then added the sliced potatoes and cooked until tender. I then added my husband s secret ingredient 1 tablespoon ketchup plus 1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce. Then added one tablespoon chopped fresh Marjoram and Basil and served. Very good.
