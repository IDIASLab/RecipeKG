I rolled the dough thinly and cut it into triagle shapes (about 2\"x2\"x2\") and spread the filling onto the triagles and then rolled them up like a crescent roll.

The instructions from the \"Waser Kipfels\" recipie work for this one though... for example cooking the walnut/milk mix on medium heat while stirring constantly. I still didn't end up with dough rolled to the right thickness (ended up with a fair bit of filling left over) but I think with some experimenting this is a good recipie. Instead of cresents I put the filling in the middle of dough squares then folded up opposite corners into the middle and pressed all the seams to seal - looks pretty and is easy to do without having filling get into the seams.",

My father said it tasted like childhood. Thank you so much for posting this recipe. We're from the Hungarian/Ukrainian border and the old fashioned cake and cookie recipes are so hard to come by.",

Instructions for rolling and shaping were a bit vague so my wife and myself ended up making all different shapes and sizes from nice crescent shaped to rectangular anywhere from 1x1 to 1-1/2x2 with thicknesses from paper thin to about 1/8\" thick on the dough. If I had read the shaping instructions from Esther's Waser Kipfels (also on this site) we would have had a much better idea on dough thickness and size. But even with the non-understanding these turned out very good. Specially for only a second time cookie baker. Will make again. Thank you.",

As I made the first batch I told myself I would never make these again (they are difficult and take lots of time and patience) Then I tasted them and knew I'd make them again! Rolling these takes some technique. I found that working with 1/4 of the dough at a time worked best. I cut the dough into 2-1/2 x 3\" rectangles spread the filling on the long side rolled and shaped. This worked okay. I tried the \"purse\" technique that someone suggested and they just fell apart in the oven. I ate the ugly ones and sprinkled the rest with powdered sugar to cover the flaws. Also I ended up having extra filling both times. I used the extra filling to make what I have coined as \"Kipfel Bread\" -- it's really really good and I'll be posting it.",
