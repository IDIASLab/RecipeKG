I did not serve it with a salsa but rather a mix of chopped tomatoes, cilantro and onion (no juices) and made a sauce of mayo, lime juice, fresh crushed garlic, diced jalapeno, and chili powder. The sauce and that bit of flavor punch makes all the difference. Add some shredded jack cheese to the tacos too!",

You have to adjust spices to your liking, but the easiest part is remembering that beer to flour ratio is about equal parts. Dry your fish with paper towels and dredge in flour first before the batter.. fries up very nicely! I make a tarter sauce with mayo, pickle relish (sweet), lemon or lime juice, cayenne pepper & cumin. This is awesome!! I've been on a fish kick since finding it.. I'm ready for some more soon. Cod or Haddock are great..",
