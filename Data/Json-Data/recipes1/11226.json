I filled my muffin cups to the top and got 12, perfectly plump and rounded muffins. I used butter rather than shortening, tho' I'm sure shortening would be just as good. I sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the batter before baking, and baked them at a constant 375 degrees. As for the taste, it was refreshing, for a change, to eat a muffin rather than a dense, sweet little cake masquerading as a muffin. Delicious and \"homey\" tasting. I really enjoyed them!",

If I were to try them again (and it's a bit \"if\") I would definately substitute butter or margarine for the shortening.

I also wisked together the dry ingredients and saved a little bit aside to toss the blueberries in, to keep them from sinking. Oh, and I also added a little lemon juice to the milk to give it a little tang. I did cut down the heat to 400* as I felt that 450* would cause it to burn on the outside and leave the inside raw.\n\nThe batter was incredibly fluffy, which\nmakes for a tender muffin. These turned out incredible and the whole family loved them.\n\nIn my opinion, this muffin recipe is better than To Die For Blueberry Muffins.\nThis will be my go-to blueberry muffin recipe from now on.",

                "reviewBody": "These muffins are tender, moist and full of blueberries. I'd compare them very favorably to a bakery muffin, quite sweet and with a cake-like texture. Some homemade muffins have a coarse crumb that doesn't keep very well and is best when still warm. These actually seem better when completely cool and keep ok for a day or so. I used butter instead of shortening as the recipe author suggests and didn't measure the berries, just added until it looked about right. The batter was quite stiff, I had to spoon mounds into my cupcake tin filled with foil liners and it came up above the rim of the cups quite a bit. I was worried that the batter would run over, but I think the stiff batter and the 5 minutes at 450 and then turning the temperature down to 375 for the rest of the cooking sets up the tops so they stay put. They didn't dome up really high, but they weren't flat or sunken. Definitely my new blueberry muffin recipe. And if you were wondering about the name, Jordan Marsh was a department store in New England that sold blueberry muffins with a sugar topping. ",
