OH NO I'm thinking...two really healthy appetites! Instead of wondering if I had enough food for everyone I just thawed 2# of ground beef in the microwave and finished this meal on the stove. I added a tablespoon and a half of Taco Seasoning from this site to kick it up a notch. Both guys loved it and the best part I knew they didn't go away hungry. Very Quick Very Easy and Very Delicious.Thanks Hallie!",

My husband thought it was much more tasty with a drop of sour cream on top.
