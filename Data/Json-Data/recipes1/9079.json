I put in the whole package as I wasn't about to leave half a package in the fridge. I left out the bacon as it really doesn't need it and it's too fattening. I left out the ham hock as the store only had them in packs of three and I wouldn't use the others. I'd imagine that they'd give the dish even MORE flavor though... I added three cans (about 6 cups) of broth as 8 cups seemed like a lot to me and I wanted it to be thicker. I topped it with the rice sliced green onions a small dollup of fat free sour cream and some shredded colby jack cheese. Serve it with cornbread and you have a heartwarming dish on a cold day!",
