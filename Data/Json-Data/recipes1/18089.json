We make these bars quite often and it's a great base to be able to mix and match seeds and fruits based on what you have or feel like having. I often replace the sesame seeds with pumpkin seeds and use raisins in place of the blueberries (only because I've had a hard time finding dried blueberries lately). I think using a quality maple syrup really adds to the flavor. Thanks for a delicious easy and healthy recipe!",
