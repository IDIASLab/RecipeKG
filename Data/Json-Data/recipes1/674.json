To start I added 1/4 cup less flour and a little under 1/4 of a cup more butter and they turned out perfect in every way. With butter icing or with a divet in the center and a bit of fruit jelly and they're wonderful.",

Pulled it out today let it warm up a bit (its less crumbly when its warmed in your hands) and proceeded to make the recipe with the help of two overzealous junior bakers. They treated that dough very roughly and still the cookies came out feathery soft with a nice crispy edge. I turned the oven down to 370F so I could watch them more closely (they overbrown pretty quickly). All in all a great recipe and one that I have added to my recipe box!",
