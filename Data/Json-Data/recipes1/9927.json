If you mix the cake mix as per the instructions on the box and then add the remaining ingredients you basically get a cake with a chocolate bottom. However if you do not mix the cake batter and just add the powder to the remaining listed ingredients it is no where near moist enough to be a batter. I think there may be a mistake in the amounts of certain ingredients listed.",
