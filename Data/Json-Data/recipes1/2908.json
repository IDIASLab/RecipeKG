If you have children, or have some coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving, I guarantee that they will eat (and enjoy) this veggie dish! Even though I rarely cook with canned condensed soups, I still make this yummy broccoli casserole during the holiday season. It's fabulous with a Christmas ham and potatoes au gratin too. Mmmmmmm!",

Cook & drain broccoli, mix everything else together (except stuffing mix), pour into greased casserole and top w/stuffing mix. Bake 350 for one hour. It is very important that you use real, full-fat ingredients such as mayonnaise and margarine. Otherwise it doesn't come out right. Also best when cools for at least 30 minutes before serving.",

I don't know why anyone would give it bad ratings unless they didn't like broccoli or cheese :)\r\n\r\nI took some of the other reviewer's advice, and instead of 1 c mayo, I did 1/2 c mayo and 1/2 sour cream. I also added 1/2 c more shredded cheese. The funny part was I discovered I only had a 16 oz pkg of broccoli florets (calls for 30 oz cut); so I used that along with another package of frozen veggie mix - of broccoli, pearl onions, and peppers; not realizing that this package added an awesome kick to the meal! I really lucked out. Anyway, like another person, I mixed the concoction together w/the cheese, then at the end mixed it with the veggies. I sprinkled a little shredded cheddar on top, then added mozarella slices - which again, out of sheer luck worked out perfectly!! \r\n\r\nMy family really loved this meal. It's a KEEPER!

However, the preparation for our recipe is different, and it does make a difference in the finished dish. Some of the ingredients are a tad different as well.\nFirst, we blanch and drain the broccoli. I think leaving out this step is why some of your dishes are coming out runny, it also makes the color appearance much better. Also, we use slightly less mayo, about 3/4 cup, more cheese (12 oz or 3 cups) and no salt or pepper. There is enough salt already in the soup. Also, we mix the broccoli into the soup mixture. Bake 45 minutes, and then top with finely smashed cheese crackers and return to oven for another 15 minutes or until cheese cracker crust is brown. It is awesome!",

I made this twice, the first time to a T to see if it needed modifying, and it did.  Use just 1/2 the mayo and add 1/2 cup sour cream for more tang and the egg isn't necessary.  With the egg, it came out a little curdled after baking and not visually appealing once you scoop into it.  And needed a dash of salt and for more flavor.  I will make it again since it's easy and comforting on a cold day.",
