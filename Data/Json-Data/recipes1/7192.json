The curry powder adds just the right flavor depth to the dressing, the celery adds some fresh crunch, and there you have it, perfect chicken salad! I do use far less curry powder than 2 teaspoons though, 1/8 tsp is plenty I can't imagine 2 tsp. It also needs about a tsp of salt and 1/8 tsp of black pepper. If you're feeling adventurous, try adding some grapes too!",
