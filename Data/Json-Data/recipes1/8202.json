But then I found this recipe on this site & he got very excited when he seen the recipe & even did most of the work making them. The only thing we changed was we bought both wonton wrappers & egg roll wrappers because he preffered the egg roll wrappers he said they were easier to work with. He absolutely LOVED them. Next time we will make another batch & freeze some he said 2 to a package for a quick fix.he's already talking of making them again & it had only been a week. Thank-you for this wonderful recipe from both my husband & I.",

One thing I did notice was that the first time I made these, I rolled them earlier in the day to cook at dinner and the wrapper got soggy.  So the next time, I strained out the broth from the meats & veggie mixture before I rolled and they came out perfect.  I also lash froze a few before cooking, wrapped them, and cooked later in the week.  It worked like a charm, just defrost partway before frying and no problem!  Thanks so much for the post...I'll make these often!!",

Next time I'd try 1-1/2 TBSP or less. Also 5 TBSP of soy sauce was a little too much in the sense that it made the egg roll filling (still in the wok) a little too soggy. Next time I'd try 3 TBSP of soy sauce and add more if necessary at the end during the taste test before rolling. I also added 1/4 tsp of ground ginger because it's a flavor usually found in egg rolls. I used a 1 LB. bag of cole slaw mix (without dressing) instead of a head of cabbage for convenience. Use ground pork instead of beef and next time I might skip out on shrimp because I don't think it added much to the egg rolls but I'll have to see about that. With those changes these egg rolls should be better next time around.",

For those who had trouble with rolling the egg rolls here's how you do it - lay the wrapper on your work surface with one point facing you. Put the filling in the bottom third of the wrapper. Roll up to the halfway point rub some egg whites on the two top sides of the wrapper fold the two ends in and continue rolling upwards. Works like a charm every time!:)",
