Turns out, the marshmallows melt almost all away so there wasn't the \"wow\" factor I was expecting. Next time I may just put them on top and broil them for a minute. I loved the cinnamon and nutmeg in this recipe. It had so much sweet flavor. Next time I would also use crushed pineapple instead of the chunks and maybe add more of it. I will be making this again. It was super easy and my sweet-tooth loved it!",
