No one I've served it to believes it's only 3 ingredients. I find that it's easiest to chop the artichokes in the food processor. I also like to mix all the ingredients and let it chill over night so the flavors can blend. It also comes out best if you use freshly grated or 'premium' (found in your grocer's deli case or cheese case) parmesan, rather than the stuff in a can. I also recommend using Hellmann's mayo for the best results. Thanks for reminding me what a simple, but great recipe this is.",
