The possibilities are endless. We sprinkled on parmesan at the table. Passed the picky kid test too. Keeper!!",

I used fat-free \"half & half\" (will use cream next time as there was an odd coagulation going on with the fat-free 1/2 & 1/2) and also added 1 tsp. black pepper. Based on other reviews I added about 2 cloves minced garlic with the butter. It was a little bit salty & the appearance was somewhat similar to gravy so I think that I'll omit the broth next time and gently simmer the sauce covered so that it doesn't reduce (unsalted butter would help w/the saltiness as well). I topped each serving with some grated pecorino romano and toasted hazel nuts. Thanks for the submission!",

I used chicken broth in lieu of the beef and added some sauteed red bell peppers yellow squash and fresh spinach which I cut into match-strips. I only used the lemon juice and a little bit of the rind..which gave it plenty of tartness. I sprinkled a hefty dose of parmesan cheese on each serving and paired this with a focaccia bread found on this site. Not sure if I'll attempt this one again but it was a nice alternative to the tomato based sauces that are so common at my place. Thanks.",
