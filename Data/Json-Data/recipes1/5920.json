I made the sauce and heated through, then added the shrimp and cooked for about 10 minutes until the shrimp was pink. Meanwhile, I microwaved a steamer bag of Asian veggies and when the shrimp were done, plated the shrimp, dumped the veggies into the remaining sauce, stirred to coat, then served with the shrimp. A quick and easy meal that was delicious! This is the best way I've prepared shrimp to date - hubby couldn't stop raving about it!",

I try to review recipes \"as written\" so those reading reviews will actually get a review of the posted recipe, but in this case I didn't have fresh shrimp.  Instead, I used thawed frozen shrimp. I prepared the sauce and ladled it over the shrimp and placed it into the oven to bake as directed.  The end result was great. I reduced the size of the recipe to \"1\" which used 1 -lb of shrimp and it fed two easily with salads.  I'll cut back a pinch on the salt next time. ",

                "reviewBody": "First I would just like to thank Tom for submitting this recipe.  I had been searching for a recipe for barbecued shrimp for months with no luck.  Well, I actually found one recipe but it was for shrimp grilled on a grill covered in bbq sauce.  \r\n\r\nNow lets just get right into it.  This recipe is great.  I had 10 different people try some shrimp and they all loved it.  Nobody could find anything wrong with it except for some weak people complaining about how hot(spice wise) it was.  \r\n\r\nAnother great thing about the recipe is that its very easy to make and doesn't take long at all.  Just follow the simple instructions that were provided and you shouldn't run into one problem.  \r\n\r\nThe only negative about this recipe is the price.  I didn't have most of the items on the list so I had to go buy them in addition to the jumbo shrimp.  I probably ended up spending $100 on the dinner but it was well worth it.  So if you are looking for some \"real\" barbecued shrimp, give this recipe a try because it definitely will not disappoint.",

                "reviewBody": "Well your biggest challenge is reducing this recipe to what you want. I tried this recipe because we loved the barbecued shrimp we got in N.O.L.A. Great basic recipe! What do you like? Garlic? Lemon? Spicey? I reduced this recipe for 1 lb. shrimp as follows: 1/4 C. butter 1/4 C. EVOO 1T. Worces 1 T. pepper 1 lemon sliced 1/2 t. hot pepper sauce 1/2 t. Italian 2 cloves garlic 1/3 t. paprika 1/2 t. salt. and added 1/2 t. Old Bay 1 T. tomato paste. What would I do different? I left the shell on my raw shrimp and cut down the back to remove the vein. Would do this again but make my sauce with 4 cloves minced garlic 1 t. hot sauce 1 t. Old Bay 2 T. tomato SAUCE cook the sauce the night before marinate the cooled sauce with the raw shrimp overnight. Before you cook dump it all together in a pan cook at 450 for 5 min. Stir cook for another 5 min check for doneness bake until just turned pink. Delisioso and messy! But ask yourself what do I like? And as the cooking shows advise taste taste taste as you are cooking the sauce.",
