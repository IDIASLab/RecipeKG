I used Honey Crisp Apples I toasted the Raisin Bread (I like crunch) & used Havarti Cheese (MY Favorite) and it was fantastic. Made it for breakfast for myself with a cup of Almond Milk and it was a very light healthy feeling Breakfast. I would definately make again! Only next time I will make sure we have cream cheese and my kids don't eat all the Granny Smith Apples!",

At first I wasn't sure about the apple in this and the mix of textures and I'm still not sure I like the crunchy apple but I do like the flavors in this and they all do go well together. I could see this as something I would serve guests at a luncheon or take to a pot luck. These were fast and easy to assemble and you could make a whole platter full in minutes with no sweat. I only used 3 oz of cream cheese for 8 pieces of bread and it was plenty.",

I was afraid the apples would darken before they were served so I dipped them into lemon juice and there was no problem. I'd bought Gala apples thinking the red skin would be more attractive than the green but perhaps Granny Smith would have been better after all since they're not as sweet. I'd recommend not slicing the apples too thin because you want that textural crunch contrast. Since there were so many people at the event I only got feedback from one person who said it was a nice combination of flavors. I tried one myself and thought it was good.",
