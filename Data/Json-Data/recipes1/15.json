I always use regular oatmeal, never quick cook as they seem to absorb more moisture and I don't usually have consistency issues.  The sugar can be cut back just a bit too, if you find them too sweet.  ",

The salt made a HUGE difference (what cookie recipe do you know of that doesn't have salt added????). I also added raw sunflower seeds. The salted kind would have been even better. For a more chocolate taste mix in either semi-sweet or dark chocolate morsels after you have mixed in the oatmeal. Instead of dropping by teaspoons full I rolled them into balls the size of walnuts.
