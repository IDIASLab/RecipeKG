I used cresent rolls rather than the crust the recipe calls for. My 16 month old daughter like it and ate a fair amount. I thought it was okay a little bland and mostly what I could taste was the sauce. I used Paul Newman Marinara sauce for mine. I will probably keep the recipe in mind for those nights I need something really fast and easy.",
