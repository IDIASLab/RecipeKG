                "reviewBody": "Had to make a number of changes to this recipe for it to work. Didn't have fresh figs so I used very fresh plump dried ones and marinated for 30 minutes: worked just fine. The amount of cognac in this recipe is 1)enough to make you very intoxicated as you taste test before filling the figs!: 2)makes for a very runny filling even when doubling the amount of mascarpone and adding more confectioners sugar. The next time I make it I'll cut the amount of cognac in half or use brandy for a less overpowering taste and increase the amount of confectioners sugar to 3/4 or 1 c. I prefer a thick filling that you can actually pile on top of the fig without it falling off as you roll them in the hazelnut mixture. Also I prefer the filling to be proportionate to the amount of fig; about 1:1 ratio. The macerating is the fastest and easiest way to do this and works with fresh or dried figs. I'm hoping next time it'll rate 5 stars in my discerning mind (although people loved it this way too!)",

If you make this recipe in the fall, when figs are in season, the result will be incredibly tasty and worth any effort.  I have made this several times and have yet to figure out a way to make the figs look pretty once they are stuffed.  The mascarpone is just not firm enough to stay on top of the figs, and it runs a little. Nonetheless, I will make this again and again for parties because everyone seems to love the unique taste.",

Other folks mentioned how messy it was to eat so I experimented before hand (it was a tough job but someones got to do it:) Basically used the same ingredients just not in the amounts indicated. The cognac is really good choice because the flavor comes through without using a lot add as much cognac to the cheese without making it runny. Add some confectioners sugar. Refrigerate cheese mixture while getting the figs ready. Wash and dry figs trim stem off slice in half. I had a little plastic syringe that I filled with some cognac and I squirted some in each of the fig halves. I then took a regular teaspoon (not a measuring spoon) and put approx. 1/2 teaspoon cheese mixture on each fig being careful to not add too much (don't let it go to the edges). Then I turned over pressing the cheese side of the fig into a dish of chopped macadamia nuts. Then placed on my serving platter and placed in the refrigerator until serving time. I also used a decorative spoon for people to use when picking up their figs. I will definitely make again. Oh-I didn't use any mint.",
