I made a batch and a half, but I left out 1/2 cup of the flour. I also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract for a little extra flavor, and it was wonderful. No need to chill the dough, and since my cookie press was broken, I used a small scoop, and pressed the dough down slightly with wet fingers, which also helped the sugar and sprinkles to stick. And a 350 degree oven seemed to work just as well A wonderful recipe.",

My husband loved them and wouldn't even let me throw 3 or 4 cookies out that I had cut too thin and had browned!
