I followed the recipe exactly, but I later experimented and can make the following suggestions:\r\n1. Instead of fresh oranges, use either canned mandarin oranges or fresh mango.\r\n2. add some fresh arugula-- it's natural peppery taste really adds to the salad.\r\n3. Slice the apples as thin as you possibly can.\r\n4. Use spanish almonds or hazelnuts instead of sunflower seeds.\r\n5. Use both golden and red beets.\r\n6.  Add some caramalized onions.  To serve 16, I used one medium red onion sliced in 1/4\" slices, brushed with olive oil, layered on a baking sheet and roasted in the oven at the same time I roasted the beets.  It took about 15-20 minutes.  The roasting brings out the natural sweetness of the onions, and they are not at all overpowering or onion-y. \r\n7. Toss greens and the dressing, then add the beets and the warm ingredients at the last minute.\r\n8.  Don't make extra because this salad does not save well overnight.  \r\n",

This is perfect for autumn or winter there are way more exciting fresh things in summer than beets and apples! In fact I served this as an appetizer to Thanksgiving and it was HUGE people came back for more salad instead of turkey. I tweaked it: 1. I used canned beets! I drained and sliced into strips. 2. Added arugula and some butter lettuce to beet greens. 3. Used walnuts instead of sunflower seeds. 4. Topped with crumbled goat cheese. 4. Used mandarins the kind that are so sweet aroudn the holidays. Again this is most definitely an autumn winter salad perfect for holiday entertaining.",
