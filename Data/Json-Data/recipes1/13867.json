You either rate it and say why you like it, or rate it and say why you hate or, or you just rate it and leave no comment at all. It's really simple to do. So here is my rating::: I LOVED IT. Everyone in my family loved it, I made the recipe AS IS and I kept it warm in the crockpot. It was great, my whole family thought it was great, and I will make it over and over again!!",

That way cold ingredients aren't being added to my hot potatoes and the flavor of the garlic is released with the heat.",
