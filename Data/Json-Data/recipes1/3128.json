If you over bake or cookies just get hard put them in an air tight container with a slice of white bread over night. In the morning the cookies will be soft and the bread will be hard. You can throw the bread out then. This is a secret passed down from my great grandmother. A sure way to save your cookies!",

I have made them hundreds of times in my life.  If they are puffy, you didn't use enough fat.  Stir some more shortening or butter into the batter and try again.  Also, NEVER roll the balls in sugar.  Simply dip the tops in sugar before placing on the cookie sheet.  This way the sugar on the bottom doesn't burn.  Finally, after you have pulled them out of the oven,, hold the cookie sheet about 2 feet from the floor and drop it.  The cookies will flatten as the extra air leaves them.  They will be even more chewy!",

We have always called them Ginger Snaps although instead of crunchy they are so nice and chewy. I always make at least 2 or 3 batches as we usually eat one whole recipe while they are still warm. Using Crisco instead of butter is a must. Check oven often--as soon as they crinkle on top I remove them (usually 8-10 minutes) so they are chewy. I already made one batch on day before Thanksgiving and they were eaten in 10 minutes!",
