I couldn't find Rolos, but I did find Dove Chocolates w/Caramel. They worked perfectly and are very good (smoother/creamier than Rolos). I also used the square shaped \"Snap\" pretzels. The chocolates fit very well on top. Baked the candies for only 3 min. - more than enough time. I think any longer and you run the risk of the caramel squishing out of the chocolate candy when you place the pecan halves on top. Be gentle or you'll have a mess on your hands, and they'll be sticky and messier to hold when served. Chill them out in the fridge for 1/2 hr. or so and they should pop right off the parchment paper. I also pre-toasted the pecans. Toasting/roasting nuts always makes them taste better. Coated the pecan halves with a little melted butter, and baked for 10 - 15 min @ 325 (watch to prevent burning). Let cool, then proceed w/recipe. Again - something so easy, and they're really popular!",

Make sure that you make at least two batches... one to enjoy right away and another so that you'll have more for tomorrow or for that special event that they were originally intended for! I used the square grid-shaped pretzels with Rolos on top and to save time, I topped them with the pecan halves before placing them in the oven so that the pecans could toast slightly as the Rolos soften.  After about 5 minutes in the oven, I just pressed down on each pecan which caused the Rolos to spread out perfectly over the square pretzel.  They looked absolutely beautiful and presentable plus you can turn out hundreds of these quite fast.  They just take a while to fully cool and set up but this can be remedied too by putting them in the refrigerator on an empty shelf to cool completely before storing them in plastic zip-top bags.  These even taste great without the added nuts on top for those (especially kids) that don't quite appreciate nuts.  Just flatten the heated Rolos with the back of a slightly oiled spoon to look like little kisses sitting on top. This will definitely be a staple for the holidays.  Thank you for sharing this delightful recipe.",

These got RAVE REVIEWS! I did take the advice of a few others and here's what you need to do to make these perfect... Use the square \"waffle\" style pretzels as they absolutely work the best. Don't buy \"Rolo's\" as your choice of caramel filled chocolates, but rather use the \"Dove\" brand instead, (they are also square and fit perfectly atop the waffle pretzel). I placed a pecan half on top of each chocolate and baked. When I took them out of the oven, I just gently pushed down on each pecan to make it ooze into the chocolate & caramel. (If you do it this way, you skip the step of toasting the pecans since they toast while they bake.) I would also suggest doubling this if you are taking it to a party. They do not last long!",

Microwave about 30 seconds remove from the microwave and squish a pecan half on top of each one. Then I just slide the wax paper off on the counter so they can cool and do another batch. The chocolate should be soft when you squish the nut on but if the caramel oozed out of the Rolo while in the microwave cut the time down a couple of seconds. I make the whole bag of Rolos while I'm at it. The thing that takes the longest is unwrapping all of the candies!",

After 4 minutes at 300 the chocolate was not soft enough to push a pecan into and have it stay. 2 more minutes then 2 more minutes. I finally tried turning up the temp. That caused the caramel to all ooze out and yet still the chocolate was not soft enough to hold the nuts. All of the nuts fell off and I was left with gooey sticky caramel pretzels. If Dove chocolate caramels are the only product that will work (as recommended by some reviewers) it would be helpful to put that in the recipe. I may try this again if I can find those.",
