Because I used two cans of artichoke hearts I added 1/2 TBSP lemon juice 2 additional TBSPs light mayo and 1/4 extra parm cheese. After I tried it I realized that I didn't even need to add the extra mayo- it was still very creamy. During the last five minutes of cook time I broiled the dish on high to get a browned top. I served this with Carr's Cheese Melts crackers which were PERFECT with this recipe.",
