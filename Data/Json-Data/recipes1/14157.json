Meanwhile, chop 1/2 pound uncooked boneless, skinless chicken breast into bite-size pieces. Add chicken, the broth, basil, oregano, salt, garlic pepper, a dash or two of poultry seasoning, and a pinch or two of dried thyme to the pot of veggies. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, cook 3 cups egg noodles according to package directions in a separate pot.  Add drained noodles to chicken and veggies, simmer an additional 10 minutes. Only if you want some creaminess, go ahead and add a half can of condensed cream of whatever soup (whatever flavor you choose).  Voil\u00e0! A SIX-star chicken noodle soup!  ",

I was ill and at my wits end and found this recipe.  I had all ingredients in the house (except for celery) and whipped this together.  I didn't have the vegetable broth and had to improvise with some chicken broth granules to make all the necessary broth.  I cubed raw chicken and boiled it in the soup to save time.  I also added garlic.  I made egg noodles on the side and added it as we ate it so the soup wouldn't get starchy.  This soup was not only easy but AMAZING!  Probably the best chicken soup I've eaten.  UPDATE:  I'm still eating this on a regular weekly basis.  I make a batch almost weekly and it freezes excellent (if you don't add pasta to it until you're ready to serve).  I now ALWAYS use vegetable broth as I really feel it adds to the flavor.  I sautee the celery, onions and carrots along with garlic to soften them up.  I also buy a rotisserie chicken and use the whole thing to make a huge batch of this soup.  I triple all veggies and my 20 month old daughter eats the veggies out of the soup by the handful!  This freezes REALLY well if you don't add pasta until you're ready to serve.  This is a definite keeper and is still the best homemade chicken soup I've had.",

A few changes I made are...I sauteed the carrots along with the onion (they end up more tender), I didn't use any veg broth but all homemade chicken broth (it's richer), I added minced garlic along with the othe veggies that cook in the butter, and I doubled the noodles (this made it more a chicken & noodles dish but it was delish!).  This is a great way to usue a rotisserie (sp?) chicken on the second day.  I really really recommend this recipe! I also freezes well!",

I was expecting something different than the way it turned out, but it is delicious all the same. I did nearly doubly the noodles and I doubled the veggies. The only problem I had was that the noodles lost their spiral shape when the soup was done--they cooked too long. I may cook them separately next time. \n\nI have to say...while I am sure there are better recipes out there somewhere, this one is quick, cheap, and easy! And as another reviewer said, it makes me not want to buy another canned chicken noodles soup again. And I don't think that I will unless I have to! I really like this! Good and flavorful!",
