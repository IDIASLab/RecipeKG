The dry rub will stop the ribs from burning on the outside, as happens with some wet sauces. This rub is hot and sweet, which makes it perfect for ribs. The proportions of ingredients can be adjusted to taste. On two continents, I've received nothing but compliments for this recipe. I use this for approximately 2 kilograms ribs.",

The best compliment came from my 8 year old who could not get enough -- she even gave up her dessert to have more of these ribs... and that is a 1st for her to eat my BBQ ribs like that.",

I would have left out the salt even if I remembered because I don't use salt in my recipies unless it's cookies. Thanks for sharing this great recipie!! I wonder if it works as good with chicken!!

Throw into slow cooker on Hi for 6 hours. My husband told me to use this instead of dry garlic for spareribs in the future. Thanks for the inspiration!",
