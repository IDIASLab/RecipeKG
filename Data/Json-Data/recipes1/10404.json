As most reviewers discovered, it takes about an hour to bake and as a matter of fact, I think mine took longer.  I made a Chocolate Kahlua Glaze instead of the one in the recipe.",

I took the advice of previous reviewers and cooked it for one hour.  After one look at that horrendous nutritional table (not for the faint hearted) I used low fat milk and sour cream in an attempt to reduce the fat content.  I filled the centre of the bundt with whole strawberries, then drizzled the glaze over both the cake and the strawberries.  I served it with vanilla ice-cream, and it was heaven!  I chilled it in the fridge for a few hours, which resulted in a sort of dense, but fudgey cake.  Onto the treadmill for me today!",

Dare I say that it was TOO rich, too heavy and dense? It was just overkill.  Also, as others have noted, the baking time is not within the range of being accurate.  As written, if you're using the pan as directed, you'll find you need to bake this at least an hour, if not 75 minutes.  If I had to do this all over, I would have eliminated the chocolate chips in the batter, or maybe used half the amount in miniature chocolate chips.  ",
