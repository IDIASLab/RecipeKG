The sprinkling of powdered sugar gives them a more fanciful look. I suggest a larger flatter base so that you can add more filling without having it leak out the sides of the folded cookies and becoming a baked on mess. Plus I wanted them to ooze more when you bite into them. They spread so do not crowd your cookie sheet.",

I was a little worried when I mixed all the ingredients together because it came out more crumbily than doughy but once I kneaded it by hand it turned to dough. Once out of the refrig. add some water to your hands and knead it again to make it softer and rollable. I did half with apricot and half with raspberry, and both were delicious. You can use any filling you want because it's the dough flavor that stands out. This is definitely a keeper! Thanks Kathy.",
