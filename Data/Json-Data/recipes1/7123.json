It has serious flaws and I urge you to use it for inspiration but heed the warnings of the reviewers. If you've ever baked a pumpkin pie you would know that 3 cups of sugar is WAY too much for this pie. Sweet potato is already sweeter than pumpkin to begin with so doesn't need much to sweeten it up. I used 1 cup and it was plenty. I used only 1/2 cup butter and can't imagine how greasy the end result would be if you actually used 2 sticks of butter in this. I reduced the half and half to 3/4 cup to get the consistency I felt was right. It will be a pretty runny consistency similar to pumpkin pie but will set up as it bakes. I have to say I like the method of sprinkling the nutmeg on top. It makes for a very pretty presentation. I also mixed a bit of it into the batter. It compliments the sweet potato really well and I didn't feel any other spice was needed. Make sure you store this in the fridge and serve cold.",

I also had a little more than 3 cups of mashed sweet potatoes. I would say about 3 and 1/2 cups almost 4. I added nutmeg cinnamon ginger and cloves as well. Not a lot of each just a pinch. It really made the difference in the flavor. This is a great pie for the Season and if you like pumpkin pie it's a great way to do something a little different. Sweet potato pie taste much better in my opinion then pumpkin it has much more flavor. This pie is great topped with some home made whip cream as well. Use around a pint of heavy whipping cream and 1/3 cup of confectioners sugar and whip it up. It's light and not so sweet as the pie is sweet enough. Top the whip cream with a sprinkle of nutmeg and it's perfect!!",
