I loved the taste! I also didn't add the walnuts. It still didn't really rise very much. The texture reminded me of fudge brownies. I actually liked the texture like that.

I did add frozen blueberries to this which could have decreased the sweetness. This doesn't remind me of a regular dessert cake but more of a coffee cake; the oatmeal makes it heartier and I think it would be good for breakfast. All in all very easy and I baked it in a Bundt pan since hubs had stolen my 9x13 to defrost chicken in the fridge. I just baked for an hour and it worked perfectly well. Thanks for the recipe!",
