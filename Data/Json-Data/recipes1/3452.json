However, never ONCE have I felt the urge to rate/review a recipe (even become a member) until I tasted this. I'm from the good 'ol South, so I've made PLENTY of split pea soup. It replaced Ramen noodles during my college years. I've recreated almost every split pea recipe on this site; I even created a few variations of my own. THIS recipe, though, beats the split peas outta EVERY recipe I've made. I followed the recipe verbatim, except for a few small changes. I used one stalk of celery instead of leaves and real garlic instead of granulated. I also whisked in the cream cheese instead of blending it (no ugly color, just magically delicious green-ness). All the reviewers who have stated this recipe isn't for them, well, they just didn't make it correctly. MAKE IT. EAT IT. You won't regret it.",

I used 5 c. chicken stock & 3 c. water to add more flavor (instead of all water).  And I sauteed the garlic and onion (white onion) in olive oil while I chopped up the carrot.  I like the flavor of sauteed onions and it also is easier to digest.\r\n\r\nIn the end it was delicious and very cheap.  ;-)  I will make this again, especially during the winter.\r\n",

I used a smaller bit of cream cheese - roughly one third of the eight ounces cause I'm skimpy when it comes to things like cream cheese. Actually i'd rather use the cheese on crackers with salt. So to compensate if you want creamy add two TBS of cornstarch mixed in 1/4 cup of water. Add hot soup to the bowl of cornstarch water and stir well. Then add to the hot soup. This makes the texture of the soup much smoother and refined. It doesn't end up looking like cement sludge if you catch my drift. It actually has a sheen like restaurant soup. And old family tradition- we add a tbs of ketchup to serve but not mix in. All in all a decent soup!",
