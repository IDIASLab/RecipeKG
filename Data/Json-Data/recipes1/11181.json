I've made this dozens of times and here are some tips: - Using a ripe frozen banana you don't really need any added sweetener so I usually skip the honey and it still tastes great. - I use almond milk (unsweetened vanilla) instead of soy which has better richer taste to it. - Add 1/4 cup of old-fashioned oats it really thickens the smoothie and makes the drink more filling too. - Experiment with different nut butters. I've also made this with almond cashew and hazelnut butter all are great but each has its own unique flavor to it. - If you're looking to watch the calories you can use a peanut powder instead of peanut butter (just make sure that peanuts are first in the ingredients list).",
