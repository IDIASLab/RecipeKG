Most of them are very good but they don't always justify investing the time and ingredients since the end product is often very similar to the plain ol' burger. Not so with Red White and Blue Burgers. Next to Surprise Burgers (also available at allrecipes) this one is my favorite. Please note: I doubled the blue cheese and doubled the ranch salad dressing seasoning (I had 2 1/2 pounds of hamburger too). Yes doubling these key ingredients lends a powerful punch with each bite but in my opinion burgers should offer up a bold flavor. No doubt doubling these ingredients would be too much for some so let your own personal preference guide you as you decide what to do. By the way these burgers don't really need condiments. I ate the first one naked (I'm referring to the burger). I used some left over sauce from Surprise Burgers as a dipping sauce for the second which provided a spectacularly sweet counterpoint to the savory flavor of the burger.",
