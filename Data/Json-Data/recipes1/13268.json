I also added 1 tbl cumin and 1 tsp red pepper flakes.  This mixture and amount of spice was perfect for us.  My husband and I both LOVED this dish.  He ranted for days about how good it was.  I served it with sweet cornbread, and topped it with a little shredded cheese and sour cream .... YUMMMO!!",

Ground turkey is bland so I also added the cumin--about 2 tablespoons as we LOVE the flavor, and used ground oregano--about 2 teaspoons to a pound of raw turkey. If you use ground turkey breast it may be necessary to add 1-2 T. oil to brown it if to dry.  I love to simmer meat and seasonings in a bit of fatless chicken broth until tender then add the rest and simmer for 10+ minutes.  Enjoy!",

I also added cumin because I love it and I used ground beef only because that's what I had.  I also used balsamic vinegar in place of the wine because that's also what I had.
