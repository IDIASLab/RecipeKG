It was good but I was hoping for more of the teriyaki flavor to come through in the burger. The consistency was nice though and sort of light because of the panko bread crumbs. I also used freshly sliced pineapple but I didn't grill it (no time) and it was really yummy on the burger. Grilling the pineapple would have probably cut down on the amount of juice so it wouldn't have made the bun soggy. Will make this again with some additional changes.",
