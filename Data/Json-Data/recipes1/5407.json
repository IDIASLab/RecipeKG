Also, make sure you have plenty of liquid to cook them in; I would say they more than double, and if they can't move freely while cooking there will be trouble (and don't ask how I know that! LOL!) I added a touch of my favorite dried herbs, and cooked in the crockpot on high for about double the stated time. Excellent. UPDATE: Made these again per the recipe (1/2 batch this time), again adding some herbs, just wanted to say they turned out great again!",

I've made this recipe about 2 dozen times, often doubling the recipe as another reviewer wrote, & each time they come out GREAT! Cut in the shortening with a pastry cutter like you would biscuits, then roll out the dough on a floured surface and pat flour on top before cutting.  Use a pizza cutter for speed -- pretty, perfect dumplings ain't what it's about, ya'll! When dropping in the dumplings, stir gently when about half are added, then once when you add in the last, then cover & cook for the remaining time. I cook a couple chicken breasts in the broth, then shred them into pieces before adding the dumplings.  Very good with fresh asparagus & a side salad -- especially for a chilly winter night's dinner.",

I also add a good sprinkling of course ground black pepper and about 2 tablespoons of dried parsely.... but remember this is when the recipe is DOUBLED. \r\n\r\nInstead of the chicken broth in a can, I fix it with a whole bird that has been slowly boiled, skinned deboned.Meal in itself.

This is coming from someone who cannot stand dumplings--swore them off years ago having been forced one too many times to stomache my mother's \"refridgerated buscuit\" version of chicken and dumplings-- I wouldn't eat them muchless  make them.  To my dismay, it is a favorite comfort food of the man of my house.  When I found my icebox empty of almost everything barring 5 chicken thighs yesterday and a family of five ravenous people in the house, I decided to give this a shot.  What wonderful luck!  Not only were they easy to make, they tasted fabulous! It is now a family favorite.\n\nThe only thing I will do different next time is roll them out very thin.  They tend to puff up quite a bit when cooking. I think maybe a little less than 1/8 of an inch in thickness would be perfect.\n\nKuddos on this one!!",
