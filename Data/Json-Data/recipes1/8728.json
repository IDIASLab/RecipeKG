She put all of the ingredients through a hand grinder that she would attach to the kitchen bar. She used graham crackers rather than vanilla wafers. She lined the empty graham cracker box with waxed paper and then packed the fruitcake into the box and stored the box in the refrigerator. She put halved cherries and pecan halves on the top to make it look pretty. Rich but very good!!!",
