I had to add 3 tablespoons of water just to make it manageable and that was with only three cups of flour. Maybe it is the difference in bread machines. The recipe instructs to cook them at 400 degrees for 45 minutes. I thought that sounded like a long time so I kept my eye on them and they were done in 15 minutes. Also this much dough does NOT fit in a 9\" pie plate. It made 10 very large rolls that had to be put on a cookie sheet in order to have enough room to rise. They tasted good and my husband said they would be good with beef stew or chicken soup.",

I did need to add more water (I used water and milk powder instead of milk easier to get room temp)during the kneading. But I always test the dough for stiffness during the second knead. Please folks remember that making breads and doughs in the bread machine still requires you to check the dough during kneading. Adding more liquid or flour according to how the dough feels. During the second knead it should feel sticky like tape. For reference I like to fold a piece of scotch tape and tape to top of bread machine. I tap my finger on it to get a feel for what the dough should fel like then I touch the dough. Adding more liquid or flour as needed. (I remove the tape before baking happens) All that said these rolls are wonderful!!! A nice delicate crunch from the corn and a lovely yeast fragrance and flavor! I am making these to take to Thanksgiving dinner! I forgot to state that I did only bake these for 15 minues (I am sure 45 is a typo) and got 10 huge rolls. You could easily make them smaller and get around 18-20 perfect dinner sized rolls.",
