The recipe is a little too juicy and does need more flour or another thicking agent to get the right consistency. It is also helpful to cut the tomatoes into smaller more bite sized pieces before baking because tomatoes dont hold their shape once cooked and they relax into long noodly shapes that are awkward to eat as pie. Otherwise yummy!",

I had an extra large pie pan so I made a larger batch than what the recipe noted. When it baked I was surprised that it smelled like apple pie and then you could smell the green tomatos. When it finished it even looked and tasted like apple pie. To me it was best cold with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of Hershey's syrup. I was so proud of it I even took photos.",
