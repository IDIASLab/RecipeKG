I wanted it to be a tasty and attractive supporting side dish.  This was exactly what I wanted. Beautiful bright white contrasting attractively with the bright green peas (I added a little extra).  Just enough flavor from the onion and the bay leaf.  This was an excellent foundation for \"Halibut with Tomato-Basil Sauce,\" also from this site.  Very pleased!",

I added some garlic while the onion was sauting and used one can of chicken stock in place of the part of the water.  The rice was good however this makes a lot more than four servings.  Because the meat I made the rice with had a strong taste it complimented well.  I wouldn't suggest this unless your meat has a lot of flavor.  Also, all I had was a can of peas and carrots.  I though this needed more vegetables though and next time I would double the amount.",

I did not have any peas so I grated 2 large carrots and added to garlic and onion. Added 1 1/2 cups of jasmine rice and stirred to coat. Poured in 2 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. Added 1 bay leaf, chopped fresh basil, and some ground black pepper. I did not add salt since I used the chicken broth which is high in sodium. Brought to a slight boil then put on low until all liquid was gone stirring occasionally. Took off heat and covered for 40 minutes. It was the best rice I have ever cooked. Thank you for the base recipe. You can do so many variations with this one. Enjoy!",

However I did use a combination of frozen peas and carrots because I did not have just peas. I also buy authentic \"jasmine rice\" from the international section of the grocery store ( mine comes from Thailand) which I believe tastes better than the ones you can buy in the regular rice section of your supermarket and it's cheaper! I also made it as an a side to a wonderful asian chicken recipe I have which I may share on here later. WONDERFUL RICE DISH! Thanks Brian!",
