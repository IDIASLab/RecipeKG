I too made adjustments based on what I had in my kitchen: Rotel canned tomatoes, no carrots (didn't realize I was out of them!!), Red kidney beans, a 14.5 oz can of chicken broth, shells instead of ditalini, and added green onions and shredded chicken. SO GOOD!! I love how adaptable this recipe is :)",

It's a flexible recipe that will be good even if you don't follow the exact measurements. I didn't have everything so here is how I customized it. If you don't have Italian seasoning you can instead use equal parts of basil marjoram oregano rosemary and thyme. I didn't have rosemary but had all the others. I used 14.5 oz can chicken broth plus a little water since I didn't have 2 cups. I had a can of diced tomatoes with jalapeno's so I used that to make it nice and spicy! Finally I used fresh cooked red kidney beans which is the reason I tried the recipe in the first place. A good recipe for using up left over veggies.",

The flavor was pretty good and even better with the shaved parmesan I put on top of my bowl. However it took way longer than 45 minutes! To soften the vegetables it did take a good 15 minutes. I did keep the burner on medium or setting 5 on my stove so they did not burn. I did really like how many fresh vegetables were in it to. I used shell noodles and I microwaved them to save some time which worked fine. With all the time spent though I was kind of dissapointed in the only 3 average servings. I would definitely double it.",
