I would expand on the sauce a little bit further. It reminded me of a bbq sauce my mother has made for years and I think it would work for this: 1 cup ketchup 1/3 cup worcestershire sauce 1 T of chili powder 1 T of salt 2 dashes of tabasco and 2 cup of water. Put in a sauce pan until mixed and heat it up pour over the pork chops with lemons and sliced onions.....Yum. 450 for 30 minutes then go to 350 for 45 minutes. You'll get more of a bbq sauce and it is tasty...",

I took one of the reviewers suggestions and used cider vinegar instead of the white vinegar. I salt and peppered the chops and lightly browned them. I removed the chops from the skillet and with the pan drippings still in the skillet I added the ketchup vinegar and some water mixed with a little cornstarch. I returned the chops to the skillet and sprinkled the brown sugar on each of the chops. I then topped each chop with a slice of onion and a slice of lemon. I love lemon and onion so I added extra of each. I brought it to a slow boil covered the skillet reduced the heat and simmered it for about 45 minutes. They were extremely moist and flavorful. It is delicious served over rice with the sauce. I am so glad that I tried this recipe. Yummy!",

I place my chops in a casserole dish put a slice of onion and 1 tablespoon of ketchup on top of each then mix 1/2 Cup of vinegar and 1/4 cup of water and pour around the chops. Cover and bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees. Can't get much simpler and the taste is great! Even thin pork chops come out moist and tasty.",

My guests have always raved over them. I would have given 5 Stars but I've never tried it with vinegar in the sauce. For those who think its bland add garlic powder and lemon pepper to the pork chops. I like to cook more along the southern-style so I bread my chops in a 50/50 seasoned cornmeal and flour mixture. I fry them in 50/50 butter and olive oil until golden brown.",
