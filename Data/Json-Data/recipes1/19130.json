Better yet they are not super sticky -- wet wipe cleans up fingers real fast. This was also very easy to put together. We recommend this recipe to anyone. We made about a half recipe to use up a small bag of microwave popcorn. It was about four cups so we estimated the other ingredients to get the proportions right. Having not made popcorn balls before we did get the coating process a little wrong -- the trick is \"quickly\" meaning right that moment so have everything ready and a helper. Nevertheless this was a great success! When we make this again we are going to add coarsely chopped peanuts and a few more marshmallows to hold them in place. But that is optional. They taste great as written.",

I doubled the batch and made bigger popcorn balls.  I did add vanilla to the marshmallow mixture and a little salt to the popcorn.  Otherwise I think it would have been a little bland.",
