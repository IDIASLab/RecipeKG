Also... beyond SUPER FAST -EASY yet a real show stopper when served!! Lots of OOOOO's...and Ahhhhh's...lol\n\n\nThis is one of those unsung hero kind of recipes.  It's a wonderful base just waiting to be filled with whatever fruits your hearts desire!\n\nI followed the recipe to the letter except for adding 1 t Mexican vanilla to the batter.  I used real butter and a glass 13x9 dish. It was cooked to perfection in exactly 20 min, but I KNOW my oven is right on the mark for temps.  \n\nI had mashed up fresh Strawberries yesterday, and reserved a few whole for the top.  My company was HERE when it was pulled from the oven.  As it started to fall I poured the strawberries over it... topped it with whipped cream, laid out a few sliced berries on top, sprinkled it with powdered sugar, and a hint of cinnamon.  I put a small American flag right in the center.  No kidding... it was absolutey gorgeous!!! \n\nNext time I'm going to make it in two smaller dishes, and one will be filled with sweetened stewed apples/sour cream mixed with whipped cream and powdered sugar/cinnamon.  Other one will be served with the strawberry mixture. \n\nIt looked like I had been working for HOURS and I'm not kidding you... it took less then 10 min to prepare this to pop into the oven!!",

I did saute some bananas in a little butter and brown sugar and topped half the pancake with this mixture. The other half I dusted with powdered sugar an drizzled with maple syrup. Yum! Keep in mind the pancake itself is bland much like a pancake and crepe it tastes like a mixture of the two. I did add some vanilla extract to the batter as well. The most delicious parts are the golden brown edges that are slightly crisp from the butter. If you have never tried an oven pancake this may not be for you but if you love crepes you will enjoy this. Bonus is it is SOOOOO easy and looks beautiful coming out of the oven.",

There was a problem with it sticking to the bottom of the pan even with the butter so I am thinking that a dark-nonstick pan would suffice instead of an aluminum one. Many layers very fluffy and flavorful. Try adding a variety of extracts into it. I used almond this time but you can try lemon maple vanilla or anything else that strikes your fancy. The pancake will bring out its flavor beutifully.",
