It says to heat the mixture, but it doesn't say what heat setting on your stove, and whether or not to stir it.  After you remove it from heat, it doesn't say if it should cool down to room temperature before adding the marshmallow, and it doesn't say if you should let it set in the refrigerator or not.  As a result, my first try at fudge came out terrible - the chocolate burned in the pan either because I had the heat too high (I had it set on the \"medium\" setting of my dial) or because I didn't stir and maybe I should have.",

Despite my stirring constantly for 45 minutes the sugar never really melted to give the fudge the smoothness it should have.

A total waste of time and ingredients.",
