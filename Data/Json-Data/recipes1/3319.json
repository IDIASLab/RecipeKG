My tips; 1) Do NOT use your Kitchen-Aid mixer (is doesn't chop up the fruit at all; 2) Add a few tablespoons of vegetable oil to the batter & mix well (ensures moisture); 3) Reduce the sauce recipe by half. This cake is going to be my Thanksgiving contribution this year.",

Cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, used the fruit cocktail juice & all, then sprinkle with powdered sugar, walnuts & coconut flakes before baking. Pour the hot butter sauce over the hot cake, while still in the pan. Yummy!!!! personally I don't use a mixer, we like the large pieces of fruit. This cake doesn't last long.",
