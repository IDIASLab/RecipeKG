I only have a little mini chopper so it took two batches to make it smoothish although not too smooth (if I wanted pate I would make pate!:). I served it with Peppy's Pita Bread off this site (a really simple recipe!). My husband likes his krab a lot more than I do so he wolfed the suckers down. I liked it but thought it might be missing something... Maybe a little hot sauce or diced celery? A nice quick recipe that can be altered to personal taste quite easily. Thanks Whitney.:)",
