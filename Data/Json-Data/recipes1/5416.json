I used low fat mayo and fat free sour cream. I made this as a layered salad rather than mixing it all together so I thinned out the dressing with a bit of vegetable stock and added a bit more seasoning. I used a big pile of lettuce for the base scattered the celery grapes and some broccoli slaw over that topped that with some leftover shredded chicken drizzled on the dressing and sprinkled it with cashews. Very tasty. I had this salad with a corn muffin and was very satisfied for dinner.",
