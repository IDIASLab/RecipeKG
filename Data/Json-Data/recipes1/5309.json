I substituted green and red M&M's for the butterscotch pieces and it makes an attractive mix in the jar for Christmas gifts-a lot easier and faster than layering all those messy ingredients! Also when combining the shortening give the spoon a rest and use your hands. Its much quicker and you can finish up with a pastry cutter for a finer texture. Overall this is fast and good-we baked one batch and they are nicely textured and flavorful with the butter shortening.",

I used 2 cups regular shortening and 2 cups butter flavor. Using your hands is much easier and a very large mixng bowl is definitely required. Hint: After adding the 4 cups to each of your mason jars let them settle a little then divide the remaining mix evenly among all 6 jars. I used a printer to print the RECIPE on a label and placed the label on the side of the jar because last year many people lost the little paper I had attached with the directions.",
