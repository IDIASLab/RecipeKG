I sauteed chopped onions & mushrooms (1/3 C. each) in butter & crushed garlic then removed pan from heat and added the ham 1/3 C. chopped artichoke hearts and the cooked asparagus (cut into smaller chunks btw). To cut fat I used 2% milk (with 1 1/2 Tbsp. flour to thicken) then stirred the sauce into the veggie-ham mix before adding the whole thing to the cooked pasta. Tip: Top each serving with ground black pepper & slivers of fresh parmesan-- YUM! PS-- Made more like 6-8 servings for us. Great for freezing!",
