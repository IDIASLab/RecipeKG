As I don't own a kitchen torch, I lined a baking sheet with foil (for easy clean up) and broiled the sugar on the halved figs under a low heat for a few minutes - turned out just right but keep an eye on them as the sugar will quickly turn from melted to burnt. This is one I will make again as it's easy enough to make a quick dessert just for one person as it is for several more.",
