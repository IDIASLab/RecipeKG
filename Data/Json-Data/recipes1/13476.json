Instead of plain cornmeal I used a pre-mixed  cornmeal, four, salt mixture.  I also added a little bit of buttermilk to the egg mixture.  I'm sure the use of flour along with the cornmeal is the secret to keeping the batter on during cooking.  Another secret is to make sure your oil is good and hot before adding the okra.",

                "reviewBody": "Oh my goodness, this was the best ever!  It turned out perfectly.  It was my first time making fried okra, so I paid close attention to the prior reviews and this is what I did.....I used frozen okra and let it thaw about half way.  I beat an egg and mixed in equal parts milk.  I poured the partially thawed okra in the bowl of egg/milk and I gently stirred to coat.  I actually stirred it every 5 min or so and let it soak for about 15 min.  I used half corn meal and half flour with salt and pepper, I then put it all in a large zip lock bag.  I added the egg washed okra to the corn meal and gently tossed to coat.  I cooked it in crisco in my 'fry daddy' until it was golden brown.  I was careful not to stir, but I did dunk the okra down with the back of a spoon after about a minute of cooking.  This was absolutely perfect, just like my grandpa used to make in his old cast iron skillet.  After loosing him last summer at the age of 94, I thought that I would never taste this wonderful veggie again.  Thanks for posting the recipe and thanks to all who gave 'tips' on how to make it with better success!",

I always cut up peeled potatoes fairly small and fry them with the okra (with a dash of extra cornmeal if I'm using pre-breaded frozen okra) and a bit of chopped onion doesn't hurt. You can't beat okra fried with potatoes though.  Also, a trick my mom taught me about frying okra, about 2 minutes before you are ready to take the skillet off the stove, carefully add in  2-3 tablespoons of water (cold is fine) then cover the skillet for two minutes. I don't know how it does it, but most all of the slime will be gone if you add water and cover at the end.",

Though simple, this recipe was delicious, even better than what I have had in restaurants (I am sure the freshness makes a difference).\r\n\r\nI have a piece of advice for any using freshly grown okra: pick it when it is a little smaller size than it can get, as it is more tender.  Slices from larger okra can be a bit tough, and though they still taste fine fried, I didn't enjoy them quite as much.\r\n\r\nSoaking in the egg and coating with the basic cornmeal mixture was enough complexity for me - the taste was superb.
