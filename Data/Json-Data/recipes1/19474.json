I used 2 cans of mushrooms 1 can corn and about 1 to 1.5 cups of sliced carrots as the vegetable. I also started the soup with a finely chopped onion and 2 cloves minced garlic cooked until translucent in about a tbsp. of oil. Then add the rest of your ingredients. I also added about 2 tsp hot sauce & think it could have used a bit more. My family liked it and I would make it again. Pretty easy to make with what you have on hand.",
