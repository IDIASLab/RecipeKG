So, I use only 6 oz of choco chips and a full cup of butterscotch chips - this amount is perfect! Replace the walnuts with those skin-on sliced almonds and don't pack your coconut.  A thicker graham crust balances the sweetness perfectly. I like to add the melted butter to a bowl first to mix up and then spread on bottom of the pan.  Cook on bottom rack - edges will look overdone but those are nice to trim off and sample!  Kids love them frozen!",

In addition the amount of chocolate chips butterscotch chips coconut and walnuts seem too much as well - which would explain those reviews where folks ended up with a sticky hard mess. My suggestion....use your own senses and judgement. Put as much or as little of the topping goodies you'd like - just make sure that your base crust will be as firm thick and stable enough to hold it all. Don't forget that the topping is mostly sugar and the condensed milk is sweet enough. You don't want to end up with something too sweet and have it go to waste! Overall - this was an acceptable recipe to use as a GUIDE.",

Mine was done in 25 min with the coconut nice n' browned. Will make again.",
