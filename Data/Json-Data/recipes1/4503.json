The recipe says the final mix should be thick and custardy; however, it was much more runny than described.  It also states you should make sure the center still quivers slightly and to not overbake it.  I followed the baking instructions, even baking it for a couple of minutes longer because I suspected it wasn't done.  I knew as I took it out that I should probably follow my instincts rather than the instructions, but I didn't--and it was indeed not done and was very runny in the center.",

The previous rater must have made some errors in cooking because the consistancy and color of the batter was like a german chocolate cake batter. It was thick and rich. After I put the batter in the pans I tapped it a couple of times to release the bubbles and had fun popping them with a toothpick. If you have a big deep pie pan this recipe will not come up shy. The espresso and chocolate compliment each other and make for an impressive dessert. I baked it in a convection oven. I used a lined cookie sheet to collect spills but there weren't any. I highly recommend this pie. Yum!",

The batter for me came out a bit runnier than expected but I think if I had beaten the batter more thoroughly like for 45 sec to a minute between each egg addtion it would have been thicker. At any rate I baked it for the listed time and pulled it out. What I love about it is that it isn't so sweet as chocolate pecan pies made with chocolate chips. The cocoa powder really cuts the sweet.

I used a ready-made pie crust and pre-baked as directed. After following the directions carefully it was still rather runny so I added another 1/4 cup at least of cocoa and also about a 1/4 cup of cornstarch and beat those in well in the mixer. I also sprinkled the top with some sea salt just because I wanted to. Then I thought I was turning down the heat from 400 degrees to 350 degrees after the first 10 minutes but accidentally changed the timer instead. About 20 minutes later I could smell the crust getting brown so I opened the oven to add a cover around the edge and realized what I had done. I could tell the pie was ready so I took it out and cooled it almost completely before slicing. It was just a little warm and stayed together very nicely and tasted very good. We ate it so fast that I was planning to add some whipped cream. Maybe next time because I'll make this again.",
