I added a little ground pepper oregano and caraway seeds to the mixture instead. I poured some tomato sauce on the bottom of the pan and lined the bottom of the pan with some of the large green outer leaves of the cabbage so the rolls would not burn. Then I set the rolls on top and poured a can of tomato sauce over the top of the rolls. I did not individually wrap each roll in foil. I covered the whole baking dish with foil and cooked at 350 degrees for 1 hour. Then I uncovered the dish and continued cooking for 30 minutes. I served with extra cooked rice. We really enjoyed it! Next time I do want to try them with the cinnamon but my dinner partner doesn't like cinnamon so I left it out for the first time that I made it.",

Much less work also - the cinnamon makes it taste so creamy and rich. I did not wrap each in foil = simply placed rolls carefully in an aluminum \"loaf\" type pan and covered with foil = much better than boiling or cooking with meat! Using the pans is just a time saver. Moist delicious tasty!!! Again = thanks for sharing.",
