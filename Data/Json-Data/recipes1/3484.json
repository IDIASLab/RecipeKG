Meanwhile I had just a bit of water boiling into which I threw in some tiny bits of leftover ham a little diced onion fresh ground pepper garlic powder parsley and cumin (for the heck of it). Once the onion was tender I put the batter in there. I just dip a bit out with the tip of a spoon then use another spoon to push it off into the boiling broth. The lumps about double in size so only use a very small amount of batter for each lump. Once the lumps were pretty much done I lowered the heat and added some milk real butter and shredded cheddar cheese. I wish I had a bit of veggies to throw in for color but it tasted very good all the same. I gave this recipe four stars but my additions made it five stars.:-) Use your imagination with this recipe!",

I also chopped up some green onions and tossed them in 5 minutes before I was done and it turned out nice. With or without noodles it's still pretty good but my choice of noodles would either be medium shells or egg noodles.",
