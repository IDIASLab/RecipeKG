I double the amount of lemon juice (1/2 cup) and use just under 1/2 cup of fresh grated parmesan cheese.  I always make it with smaller chicken tenderloins, which cook so fast, and serve the chicken over noodles with alfredo sauce.  The sauce is so delicious, I pour any extra over the chicken and noodles.  The blend of lemon juice, parmesan cheese, and butter is just DIVINE!  The reason people may have had problems with the parmesan cheese clumping is maybe because they don't have enough lemon juice... I have never had that problem.",

However I too found that the recipe called for too much butter. I used four large chicken breast and added 3 Tbsp of butter with the lemon juice instead of the 6 Tbsp the recipe required. I had no problems using the canned parmesan. However after adding the parmesan I lowered the heat to a simmering boil occasionally whisking it and allowed the sauce to thicken. I also think using real butter in comparison to margarine also makes a huge difference in the taste of this recipe.",
