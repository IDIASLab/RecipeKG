First, make sure that the eggs that you use are large, or extra-large, otherwise you will have to use a little water to make the pastry the right consistency to pat into the mini muffin pan.  Also, I added a pinch of salt to both the pastry dough, and the filling.  It's kind of cumbersome to work with one pan as I did...if I make this recipe again, which I probably will, I will invest in another muffin tin, that way I can bake the shells all at the same temperature, and then lower the temp for the filling.  Otherwise, this is a very nice recipe to fill in your holiday cookie tray!",

I add a pinch of salt and decrease the almond extract to 1/2 tsp - the almond flavor is a bit overpowering. Note that the recipe says to decrease the temperature when baking with the filling - it's easy to overlook that instruction. Also it helps to separate the dough before shaping it (makes exactly 24 shells). I have made these several times and I now cut the filling ingredients in half because I end up with so much left over (tastes great warmed over vanilla ice cream though!). A very pretty way to serve them is to place them on a large white platter and arrange blueberries and whole strawberries with the stems around them. Thanks for the recipe!",

My crust was a little hard probably due to over-baking. As mentioned by another reviewer the ingredient list does not list 'pecan halves'. Fortunately I had a bunch of pecans in the freezer and was able to select enough presentable halves. I used a twenty-four section mini-muffin pan and felt that my crust was a bit thick in places in the bottom. Had the crust been thinner I would have had many more than twenty-four. I had at least half the filling left so...? The taste of the crust and filling was very good. For those who try this recipe as first-timers just be aware of the quantities/ratio of crust and filling.",

However I made a mistake and filled them without baking the shells first and ended up having to bake the filled tarts for 25 minutes. Not that it was such a bad thing in fact we liked them even better they turned out really chewy like candy and the filling baked into the pastry part and gave the crust a really nice taste.(they were a little difficult to get out of the aluminum shell though because they bubbled slightly over the edge - had to use a fork - so I wouldn't make them like this for company) I will try these again but bake the pastry part first to see the difference. It made 7 regular sized tarts.",

Maybe better! I found that if you're just going to make the filling then to fill the tart shells almost to the top and then cover with pecans. So if you have 6 tart shells make enough filling for 12. I also found I had to put these in the fridge afterwards so that the filling would solidify a bit more. I don't know if others found this a problem and maybe I didn't leave it in the oven long enough. But overall takes two minutes to prepare!! Very convenient dessert:)",
