I made the cake this morning for my husband's office & here's what he said--\"I had 2 pieces & others had several--it was very very good!\" Here are the only adjustments I made: cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup cut the oil to 1/2 cup added 1/3 cup water; left out the raisins & nuts. Baking temp of 300 seemed to low to me so I upped it to 325 then to 340. I think the temp & time need adjustment. The icing was great--I added 1/4 t maple flavoring & 1 t vanilla. Thanks for a keeper Suzanne!",
