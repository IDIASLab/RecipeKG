Since I married a Canadian an am living in Canada I tried repeatedly to master the pie crusts. Usually my pie crusts didn't turn out so great, so I usually used the pre-made frozen or the Pillsbury one, which is not too bad. Yesterday I tried out this recipe with Chicke pot pie and this has been the yummiest crust. Even my 6-year old ate 2 pieces of the pie and the crust, which she used to leave behind on the plate. It really worked for me. Now I feel I can finally make a pie that is completely homemade and I feel this is a great achievement. Thanks a million, it went into my keeper box.",
