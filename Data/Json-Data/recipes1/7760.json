After the glazing and baking process, I separated the sandwiches with a serrated knife. This method is faster and easier than trying to cut, stuff, and glaze two dozen tiny sandwiches. I also used a silicone pastry brush to apply the butter mixture.",

I used 4 Sara Lee Bakery Buns (large), layered ham, turkey, and provolone.  I made the full recipe of the drizzling sauce and slathered the bun tops and baked on foil lined baking sheet for about 20 minutes.  If I would have been able to find the Kings Hawaiin buns, I would have, but I'm glad I used the Sara Lee buns.  I think the Hawaiin buns would have been \"too much\".  I loved the toasted flavor of the bun.  Thanks for a good alternative sandwich recipe!",

Nobody complained but nobody praised them either. I used sweet Hawaiian rolls and sliced Boar's Head ham. I took others' advice and used less butter for the sauce. I used a dijon mustard. I really liked the little pieces of minced onion. I used a pastry brush to spread the butter mixture on both sides of the roll and then on top of it as well and that worked out very well. I would say that the sauce was not quite spicy enough for my taste. Next time I may find a spicier mustard or add a little horseradish to it. These would be perfect for on-the-go food like lunch to have in the car while you're traveling. Just put a bunch of them in some plastic baggies. I have a feeling men would really like these too. Simple but flavorful and hearty. Overall a pretty good recipe.",
