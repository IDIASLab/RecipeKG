I used Shrimp bisque 3/4 lb of fresh peeled shrimp used OLD BAy seasoning pepper and Garlic powder from here I followed the recipe but a note to those complaining of the pasta problems DO NOT USE hard pasta boxed or wrapped many major supermarkets sell refrigerated pasta which is more fresh and VERY soft where you will have no problem mixing in the pasta but if you're in a bind and only have hard angel hair I would think to cook the pasta a bit where it softens up for you and is mixable. But this dish is ti die for no question...",

Also added the extra 1/2 cup of milk as well as 2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning and 1/4 tsp of ground black pepper and probably 2 tsp of dried parsley leaves. Also to help with the issue of the noodles not cooking all the way cooked in a low flat casserole dish. Will probably use 1 tbsp of Old Bay next time and possibly see about adding in dry mustard as well. Flavor was very subtle with only 2 tsp. DH kept going back for more.",
