I would suggest cooking it uncovered for an additional 15 min. to really cook it all the way through and melt/brown the top crust. Also try to cut the potatos super thin while the yams are sliced thicker because the yams tend to cook to quickly while the potatos take longer to cook.",

I would recommend a few alterations though - Omit the breadcrumbs they're not necessary. Bake for 30 min without the cheese then add cheese and bake for 30 min more so cheese doesnt buurn. Next time I might add some cheese between the layers of potatoes. I definitely will want to make this again with the alterations I mentioned.",
