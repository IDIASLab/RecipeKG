I followed this recipe and as most people found it is hard to find tomatoes in a paste form already. I changed it as follows: 1. lg can of crushed Contadina Tomatoes 1. Lg can of diced Contadina Tomatoes 2. 12 oz cans of Contadina tom. Paste 1. 6 oz can of Contadina paste w/garlic (makes up for the lack of enough garlic in the orig recipe) 2. 1/4-1/3 cup of sugar.. I added to taste. I like my sauce sweeter 1. 1 tsp of salt For the red wine I suggest a sweet red. I used one called Campagna Di Romani but any sweet wine will do. The wine gave it some sweet to counteract the acid from the tomato. After the changes the sauce seems much better and has a lot more flavor to it.",
