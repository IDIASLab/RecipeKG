This recipe is for the squash lover at heart, and those who are looking for something really sugar sweet and coated will not find happiness here.  All of us at the house decided this isn't the recipe for us as we prefer more...spice and less in your face squash flavor.  The glaze was fantastic, but there simply wasn't enough to go around for us to enjoy our squash with.  We're headed back to nutmeg, agave, cinnamon and vanilla.  I halved the recipe and omitted the cayenne as the kids don't do spicy.",

I prepared it exactly as instructed, with the one exception of softening the squash in the microwave before cutting it in half (so much easier!).  I pierced it with a fork and nuked it for about 5 minutes, then reduced the initial time in the oven to 20 minutes.  It turned out beautifully.  Scoring the flesh really allowed the glaze to seep in well, and my guests loved the fact that the glaze was sweet, but not TOO sweet.  It is refreshing to stumble upon an acorn squash recipe that doesn't drown the flavor in butter and brown sugar!  As I side dish, I prepared rice with sauteed celery, mushrooms, apples, onions, water chestnuts, almonds, and Craisins.  It was a delicious and relatively simple autumn meal, and I will be making it again!",
