The bacon dressing is one I've used many times and is basically the same one I use for German-style potato salad (without the lemon juice). The entire dish is very flavorful and a most welcome change-up for a side dish. I did follow the suggestion of lutzflcat and used the food processor to slice the veggies after I cut out the core. Easy and delicious!",

I made it again for an extended family gathering where everyone, except one young nephew, enjoyed it. (I highly agree with lutzfulcat's recommendation of using a food processor; thinly slicing all those sprouts was tedious)\n\n I did find the cider bacon dressing to be a bit bitey as written, but added another 1-2 T of brown sugar to balance it out. ( I also liked the flavor of the lemon juice).  When I made it for extended family, I tossed in 1/4 C finely chopped onion, 1 zested carrot and a handful of dried cranberries. I  brought some blue cheese crumbles to add to taste. Very good, a different salad to enjoy.",
