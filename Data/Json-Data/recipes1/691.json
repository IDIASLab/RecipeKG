I weigh my dry ingredients after making the cookie dough as written it was so soft I had to add an additional 6 tbps of flour. Increased the vanilla from 1/4 tsp to 1 tsp. Used crushed cinnamon hearts for peppermints ground 5 heaping tbsps used 1 tsp in each cookie would increase to 1 1/4 tsps as there were a few spots visible nothing major. The dough has to be chilled overnight after I cut the large hearts I placed them on the cookie sheets then put them in the freezer for about 10 minutes then cut out center hearts then filled and then baked. Used my largest heart cutter yielded 18 cookies that baked in 10 minutes on parchment lined sheets. I was really unsure about these cookies but I was surprised at how tasty they were with some tweaking.",
