I added jam before baking on most of them the ones I indented and baked without had no indentation left once baked. Maybe they needed more flour in the recipe. I also baked some without rolling in the nuts. They spread almost completely flat. I think it could also use some vanilla in the dough. I like the almond shortbread thumbprints better. Thanks anyway!",
