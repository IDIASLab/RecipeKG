I cooked untill the internal temperature reached 180 degrees. The meat was tender and juicy...not to mention elegant. I served with Saffron Rice and Broccoli.",

In the cavity I salt and peppered and added the poultry seasoning before I put in lemon and leeks.

Even the breast meat was juicy after cooking 1 1/2 hours. The whole family thought they were great and looked elegant!..

I made a herb and garlic infused butter (Rosemary sage thyme and parsley) and coated the cavity before seasoning with salt pepper and stuffing with lemon and leeks. I made a layer of sliced lemon and leeks in the bottom of the pan with what I had left over. I sprinkled the poultry seasoning salt pepper and the zest of one lemon on the outside of the hens and sprinkled with fresh parsley. I basted more of the butter several times during the cook process which was more like an hour and a half. The end result was flavorful moist and fantastic! Will definitely make again!",
