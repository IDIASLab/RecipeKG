I had to throw  my first 2 cakes and the towels away, because they stuck to the towel so bad, and I didn't even want to bother washing them.WHAT A MESS!!!  I tried aluminium foil, greased and dusted with flour and it worked WONDERFULLY!!! Just pulled it right out of the pan, put a piece of parchment on top, and rolled it right up in the foil.  The recipe is 5 star+.  I didn't use lemon juice, and instead of the cinnamon and cloves, I used 1TBLSP of pumpkin spice.  Everyone was raving how heavenly it tasted. I will def. make over and over.  Can't wait to give away as small gifts for Christmas.  Thank  you!!!!\nAnother thing I forgot to mention, i didn't use any lemon juice or the nuts.",

I have to add something to this....i used parchment paper in my pan also it worked great it made it easy to get the cake out i did notice that if my cake wasnt quite done yet it would break after being rolled up but i used the filling to patch it and then roll it worked great! Also my family enjoyed it slightly frozen i just put it in the freezer and then take it out when we want a quick desert it does thaw and become moist its delicious either way....if you havent tried this recipe you should! Definetely freezing the roll after it is complete has worked for me the best I'm able to slice it while frozen and then serve it thawed. works great! Also I just made some recently and I baked the cake in foil and then put parchment paper on top and rolled it It does work great! I got this tip from another review.",

The pan size was not mentioned and my large cookie sheet must have been too large. When I turned the cookie sheet over the cake did not release from the pan. That is as far as I got with the recipe. I will try again but I will use wax paper as mentioned in previous reviews along with a smaller pan.",
