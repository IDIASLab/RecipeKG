I then carmelize the onions lighly and saute the mushrooms followed by another deglaze consiting of wine and balsamic vinegar.

We enjoyed dipping our rolls in the sauce. It was very tasty reminded me a lot of a frozen dinner we had before. I skipped the oil and flour part and fried the meat plain to spare unneeded fat calories. I used canned beef broth a small can of mushrooms and 1 small onion and everthing else as described. The meat came out very tender and the juice was awesome. This spelled terrible cooking. Next time I will either keep the meat one piece and serve as a side or find a way to thicken the juice. This didn't taste like beef burgundy more like au jus for roast beef.",

I had a lot of extra liquid so I combined some flour paste into it to thicken it up a bit.
