I also used chicken breasts and instead of using canned chicken broth I used home made chicken broth I had in the freezer and threw everything except the rice into the slow cooker. I made the rice separately in a rice cooker using chicken stock and then placed about a half cup of rice in the bowl topped with soup. I kept the rice and soup separate because I did not want the rice to stuck up too much stock when saved in the fridge - I've had this happen with other soups with rice and noodles. I think this recipe is a good start but needs some salt and maybe a some other herbs and spices to get it to a five star recipe.",
