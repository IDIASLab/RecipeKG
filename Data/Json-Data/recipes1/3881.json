I used 1/2 stick butter and a drizzle of olive oil, threw in 6 cloves of minced garlic & let it saute a few, added 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes and let that toast a minute (next time I will add even more), next the wine & let that reduce a minute or two before adding the clam juice and then the juice of half a lemon.  The other changes I made: I cooked the pasta a minute or two short and finished cooking it in the clam broth and didn't add the parsley (less than called for) til the last minute.  I served it with french bread with butter and a delicious riesling.  So good I'm gonna go have my second serving right now!",

Do not cook the clams....just add into the turned off broth.  Just before draining the pasta (al dente, please!), reserve about 1 cup of pasta water. Just before serving,add the pasta water little by little in order to get the right consistency.  This dish should not be dry.  Sprinkle with parsley and a good grated cheese.
