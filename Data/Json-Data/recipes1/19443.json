Yes, sauteed garlic, but also a balance of salt & sugar, some pepper, a tiny pinch of thyme, and a gob of dry mustard (I just kept putting in more dry mustard until I was finally satisfied)....., oh, and the Deutcherin in me came out when I put in some potato flakes after the mustard was finally 'in place' ........  MADE THIS UP AHEAD OF TIME IN THE CROCKPOT AFTER BROWNING THE FLOUR IN THE BUTTER JUST A TAD....., (at the end, I worked in the cornstarch by mixing it into the sour cream, but since we used potato flakes, we probably could have simply put the sour cream in with the snails sans cornstarch) - -  WE PUT IN THE ESCARGOT and fluid DURING THE LAST 15 MINUTES. - - - [note to self, do not use that much butter next time....... maybe half as much or a bit less.......]",
