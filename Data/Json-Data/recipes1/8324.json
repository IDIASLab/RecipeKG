I left out the cream and added rum flavoring. It's just like the store bought eggnog that I love but at less than 1/4 the price. Some tips that made this easier for me: Cook this over medium heat in a double boiler (or in my case a metal bowl over a pot of boiling water). This will make the cooking take a little longer but will all but eliminate the risk of curdling. The target temperature should be 170F. This is hot enough to kill any bacteria but not hot enough to make scrambled eggs.",
