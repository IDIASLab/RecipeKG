I substituted all-purpose flour for some of the bread flour and I didn't use all of the flour called for (2 1/2 cups bread flour about 3 cups all purpose). If you put butter on the bread before plopping it in the oven the crust turns out great. Keep the bread warm when it rises and it will bake nicely!",

I did 1/2 the recipe and used lard vs shortening. Man, I'm making the whole recipe next time...it's that good! I did decrease the sugar a bit and glad I did, it was plenty sweet. I could barely contain the dough it was rising so fast but that's okay. I like the 3 rise method but I think when I go with full recipe I'll use only 1 package of yeast. I'm sure that will be plenty. Anyway...was soooooo good with fresh egg salad or sliced while still warm w/some butter. I may attempt to replace 1 C of white with wheat flour but no more than that. I don't want it to become heavy. Thanks for this recipe...I LOVE IT! Oh, I did add a T of fresh chopped rosemary and I feel you could turn this into any herb flavored bread of your liking. I'm sure this would make awesome dinner rolls or dough for cinnamon rolls.",

I love baking but bread has always been my nemesis I could create Italian and Spanish inspired wonders but the secret to regular bread had eluded me for nearly a year. This recipe has changed everything! It turned out amazing it has a nice flaky crust with a beautiful savoury buttery flavour. I halved the recipe used butter instead of shortening and for fear of lack of flavour added 1/2 tsp of salt. This baker is very happy thanks for giving me confidence with bread again!",

I am apparently a fabulous baker...or more accurately this recipe is not only easy to follow but fantastic as well. The steps are clear and easy to follow. The only changes I made were using butter instead of shortening (I don't keep it in my house) and using only 1/4 cup of sugar. I decided to share 1/2 a loaf with my parents to get an honest opinion (yes, my mother will tell it like it is and not sugar-coat it) and I got a call this morning asking if I was taking orders because she wanted two more loaves because she couldn't stop eating it. Don't be scared by the number of steps and the length of each because it really is very easy, just takes a while to complete but WELL worth the effort!",
