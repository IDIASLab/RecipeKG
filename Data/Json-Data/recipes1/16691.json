I was at the store the other day and seen something called instant pectin in the canning isle. I bought it just to try it. I did a search on here, for instant pectin, and found this recipe. I cut the recipe in half and used all strawberries, because I didn't want to have to worry about raspberry seeds. I don't care to much for lemon rind, so I just used a small squeeze of lemon juice. Although, I wish I would have used some zest, just cut back, as I think it may have made it more liquidy. When I at first tasted it with the sugar added it didn't really taste like jam. Then I stirred in the pectin and it had the flavor of jam instantly, strangely. Although, I did have chunks of strawberries that still needed to be mashed. It may have been better to let it sit with the sugar for some time to release some of the strawberries natural juices. Half the recipe did easily fit though in a 1 cup container with a twist on lid to store for later.",
