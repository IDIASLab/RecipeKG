More meat than I expected (got nervous and cooked a turkey breast too just in case!)Meat was deceiving - only 10 bones but more than enough meat for 14 people. Butcher should have explained how much add'l meat was there in addition to the chops. All my recipes came from Allrecipes and were wonderful! Root vegetable mix holiday baked mashed potatoes special cranberry relish....just wonderful. Yes I took a chance trying new recipes on a holiday for 15 people but I'd read each one thoroughly including reviews & comments and picked out really good recipes. It had been over 25 years since I'd attempted a crown roast...sorry I waited so long!!! Thank you everyone for making my holiday cooking so easy interesting and successful.",

I had always stayed away from this particular cut because it seemed so daunting. I happened upon one in the butcher shop however and my husband said 'go for it'. Pork is my favourite roast and I usually order a pork loin whenever I do a pork roast but never done up so nicely. I followed the recipe to a 't' and it was wondeful -very very easy and as I said earlier made a huge impression. The ONLY problem was that we couldn't figure out to cook the inside of the roast without overcooking the outsides. We ended up just leaving the inside abit raw and then cut around it and then recooked the pinker parts. The inside was almost raw after over 3.5 hours of cooking.",
