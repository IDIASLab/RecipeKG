I've been making these with the same ingredients in different amounts for years with excellent results.  The bottom layer should only have 1 egg and end with a very thick consistency.  You should not be able to pour it.  It has to be spread into the pan.  The top layer should have no butter in it, which is probably contributing to the burning.  Bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes, then start checking it.  Depending on your oven, it will only take 25-30 minutes and will not look \"done\" when you take it out.  These set up considerably after sitting!  If you let them bake until they appear done, then you've probably already ruined them.",
