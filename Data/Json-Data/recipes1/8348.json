Noodle dinners are popular community events and there is some small amount of competition as to who's are best. The recipe passed down to me through at least 4 generations can be found in \"Betty Crocker's Cookbook\". My family has slightly altered that recipe by using half-and-half in place of water, which creates a richer-tasting noodle. If the dough is dry and crumbly before rolling, adding egg yolks or more half-and-half will easily fix the problem. We often fix them with beef or chicken for a family dinner, and Thanksgiving without noodles in turkey broth would be unthinkable! Also, if you are a real Hoosier, you eat your noodles on top of mashed potatoes!",

                "reviewBody": "This was the first time I ever made homemade noodles and I had so much fun! Instead of mixing the ingredients by hand I used a food processor. I processed the flour salt and egg yolks (omitted the baking powder) until mixture formed fine crumbs. Then with the processor running I slowly added about 1/3 cup of water through the feed tube just until the dough forms a ball. (Without the water the dough was too dry and would not form into a ball.) I let the dough ball rest for 10 minutes before dividing it into quarters and proceeding with recipe. After rolling I let the four sheets of 12\" square dough rest uncovered for 20 minutes. Then I loosely rolled up dough jelly-roll style and cut into 1/4\" wide strips. Lastly I let the strips dry on cooling racks for a couple of hours. The noodles are then cooked in canned chicken broth for about 2 to 3 minutes with baby bok choy Vietnamese beef balls and sliced fish cakes. What a delicious meal!",

I used the recipe given and added 1/2 cup of half and half. There was still some trouble with dryness so I added about 1 tablespoon of egg white. They are drying now so I can't comment on how they will actually taste but hoping for the best. Tips are always good: If you don't own a noodle cutter try using a pizza slicer---works fantastic. A knife is too time consuming and harder to control the noodle size. Always use your turkey broth for cooking and scrape the pan to get the good bits and pieces off----it adds loads of flavor. Happy Thanksgiving! Upate: Don't roll these out TOO thin......I did and ended up with a globby mess that barely resembeled noodles!",
