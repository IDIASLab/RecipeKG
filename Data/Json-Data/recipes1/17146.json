Next time I make this I will omit the kumquats and just squeeze some fresh orange juice over the spinach instead. The kumquats did give it a nice hint of sweetness but it was a lot of work to peel and cut them. The second night we had this for leftovers I cut up the swordfish and mangoes and tossed everything together and it was much tastier (and I didn't think it could get tastier!). I liked having all of the flavors mixing together. My husband and I couldn't stop talking about how yummy this was. We will make it again and again. I highly recommend it!!",

One thing I did change was I just used my own bought raspberry vinaigrette dressing and we loved it! The only other thing I MIGHT change would be to marinade the swordfish overnight or a few hours before hand. I will have to figure out what type of marinade to use to mesh with the mango spinach and vinaigrette dressing. I was thinking soy sauce based",
