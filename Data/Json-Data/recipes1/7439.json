I realized when I went to make the recipe today that I had forgotten to soak the raisins overnight. I put some of the tea the brown sugar and the raisins in a sauce pan and brought it to a boil and let it cook a few minutes and set it aside for a couple of hours. The raisins were pretty well plumped up and it worked fine. As for the runniness of the batter I measured the flour then sifted it measured again and found I had a lot of flour left over if I were to go by the sifted measure and the batter did seem too runny so I put the rest of the flour in. My guess is that you measure before sifting in this recipe. At least it worked well. Also my eggs seemed small so I added one extra egg to the doubled recipe. I didn't have and couldn't find citron this time of year so I added about half the amount in orange and grapefruit zest and it gave a nice flavor. I cooked the zest in with the raisins and sugar so they got soaked for a while. I'll make it again and got requests for the recipe.",

I'm giving it four stars instead of five because the baking time was so far off for me. I read another reviewer who made the same complaint so I watched the oven very closely. The temp stayed exactly at 350 and my cake (baked in a loaf pan) was done in 45-50 minutes. This cake is quite sweet even though I cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 C lightly packed. (If you reduce the sugar as I did be sure to cut down on the tea--maybe from 1 3/4 C to 1 1/2 so that the batter won't be runny and the fruit won't settle at the bottom.) By the way I used regular (brown) Sunmaid raisins and substituted glace fruit for the citron. (I'm sure that citron would have been very good because lemon goes so well with tea but I didn't have any.) Also I didn't have self-rising flour so I made my own. For this recipe just add 1 7/8 T baking powder and 5/8 t salt to the flour before sifting. One last thing: I always wonder what a recipe is going to taste like; and since I'd never heard of barm brack I was especially concerned about this one. I'd call it a kind of cross between zucchini bread and fruit cake--remember that I used glace fruit not citron--with a slight tea flavor (though no one but me seemed to taste the tea) and it's moist and dense in texture. Anyway this was really easy tasty and a little bit different from other desserts.",
