After baking, allow it to sit still wrapped in foil for an additional 10 minutes.  Overall prep time is almost the same, but less pots and pans to wash!!  :-)",

I used cottage cheese as the recipe called for but it did make the sauce a little sweeter than I prefer. I also used two jars of pasta sauce as other reviewers said there wasn't enough sauce using one jar and I was glad I used two. I also did not blend the cottage cheese with the pasta sauce since I like the chunkier sauces and the sauce I used had vegetables in it. Overall it made a fine meal and I will make it again.",

I have been making lasagna for years one of my favorite dishes and I have NEVER cooked the lasagna noodles- I always just use them raw. If you layer the lasagna as stated in this recipe (or any other) with noodles meat sauce cheese of choice and again the noodles will come out perfect every time. The juices from the tomato sauce actually cook the noodles and this is a huge time saver (and one less pot to wash). Trust me just try it! I then bake the lasagna covered with foil for 50 minutes uncover and top with cheese then bake for an additional 10 minutes to melt the cheese on top!",
