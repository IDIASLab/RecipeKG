There a few caveats that should be mentioned as we all know that half of our cooking success is really in technique and not just the ingredients. First--try to make on low humidity day or have the AC going to dehumidify the air--things just seem to work in this recipe better with lower humidity. Second--WRT ingredients--whole milk or any level of cream will work better--must be dairy and not any of the imitations that are quite good but will NOT yielod the same result with THIS particular recipe. THIRD--please do yourself a favor and use butter the first few times around with this recipe--my only failures came in using a cheap margarine and other whipped \"spreads\" that are great on toast but don't always make the transition into old family favorite recipes (I figure if my mom and grandma made it with butter--if I want the same result I should use butter)--actually my frosting was slimey tasting when I used one of those 'spreads'--grossed me out and I wasted the other ingredients and still had to get dressed and run to my all night grocer. You need to reduce the flour and milk mixture to a smooth paste by constantly whisking over medium low heat. Is this a fussy recipe--kinda but well worth the effort and like everything else--the more times you prepare it--the better you will become.",

A friend of mine in Michigan used it for a coconut cake and when I moved I lost contact with her, as well as my recipe book with all my favorites.  NOW I can finally make icing that works for me.    As SEVERAL people have said, this works only with butter, not margarine, though you can use shortening.  The flour and milk must be COLD before you combine it with the other ingredients, not just room temperature.  Otherwise, it is gooey and not at all what you are looking for.  I put mine in the freezer when I take it off the stove and leave it for about 20 minutes or more until it is very well chilled.  Do not take it off the stove until it is so thick that it is a paste, not a white sauce.  Other than that, you should always be successful.  Good luck!",

There are a couple of problems that people seem to have with this recipe. The first is that you must whisk the flour into the milk until you do not see any more clumps. Then you need to cook the mixture over medium heat and constantly stir until it thickens into a paste. Which is sort of a pain but well worth the effort. The second problem is that you must wait until the flour mixture is completely cool before combining with other ingredients. This is key. I use my recipe all the time. Goes great with chocolate chip banana cake.",
