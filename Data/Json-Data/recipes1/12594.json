They were nice and crispy and everyone loved them however they were very crumbly and messy and I would recommend you use these for outside eating especially if some of the guests are children. I live in AZ and our summers are too hot to eat outdoors so we ate inside and the kids made a mess on the floor. Also fry these in a deep fryer. I do have one but I decided to just heat some oil in a pan and do it that way. It took about 45 minutes to make a double batch of these and after such a long period of time the oil really started to irritate my eyes. They were irritated for the rest of the day. Next time I will definately use my deep fryer. Try these for a fun dessert!",
