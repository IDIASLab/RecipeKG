First spreading out the dough that much with your fingers is just about impossible to do evenly. Add a large piece of parchment or wax paper on top of the dough (of course there is a sheet below the dough also) and then use a rolling pin to spread the dough out. Peel back the top piece of parchment paper and you have a nice smooth surface to spread out your chocolate. After the chocolate is spread use the bottom piece of parchment to help you roll up the dough by picking up the edge near you and holding it up while you roll over the dough with your hand. Continue til the whole roll is done- don't try to pick it up until it's all the way rolled. I put it in the freezer for 30 minutes. The dough wasn't too hard and made it very easy to slice. I had to increase the bake time a couple of minutes for the first batch since the dough was so cold going in. The cookies will fall apart if you don't let them cool at least 5 minutes on the sheet before taking them off. Beautiful soft cookies with a good balance of peanut butter and chocolate. Will make again for sure!",

I tried these last week and was tired and in a hurry so I did as one reviewer suggested and used whole chocolate chips. I wouldn't recommend that--they just fell apart completely so I just sort of smooshed them all together and make regular cookies. I tried again today and my pinwheels were log shaped--only a few looked pretty. So I think I need some practice at this! I melted the chocolate in the microwave (just melt for a min stir and continue until it is all melted) and spread it out over the cookies. They are very good--nice mix of chocolate and peanut butter. Thanks!",

But the end result is delicious and does deserve five stars on it's own. The reason I give this recipe four stars though is because the cookies did not puff up as I expected it seemed to when it came out the oven but it quickly fell into this thin and semi-crisp type of cookie. Still enjoyable though. I may give this one another try really does taste great.",

I had my doubts about spreading melted chocolate over soft dough so I chilled the dough some before I spread the slightly cooled chocolate over top. Once spread the cookie was very hard and messy to roll but I stil had hopes for a good cookie. It all fell apart though (literally) once I took it out of the fridge and started cutting it. The cookies fell apart and were not attractive at all once baked. I think it'd be easier to just put the whole chips into the dough and not worry about melting and spreading...the results would be quite similar with far less time and effort expended.",
