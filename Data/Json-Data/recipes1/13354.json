I cut the salt to about 1/8 tsp and  mixed the oats into the liquid ingredients to soak before combining the dry components. Because my oven runs hot, I baked slightly below 375. I used  Wilton silicone muffin pans (pre-greased) and baked for about 16 minutes. The resulting muffins were delicious: moist and sweet. The tops were a bit flat, so I'll try more baking powder next time. Once properly cooled, my batch was not unusually crumbly--in fact, they hold together quite well. Soaking the oats must be the secret. I'll bet they'd be great with shredded carrot added.",

                "reviewBody": "I love the flavor of maple and I love baking with it. This recipe appealed to me but I immediately noticed it had salt overload so I reduced it by half. Also tho I always bake with boldly flavored Grade B maple syrup I wanted to ensure bold maple flavor so I omitted the cinnamon and added 1 tsp. of maple extract. As I mixed up the batter I was concerned it was curdly although it did correct once I added the dry ingredients. I was again concerned as they were baking - flat spreading into muffin tops rather than rising into a rounded dome and caving in the center. I often notice this feature in coffee houses and bakeries so maybe that s considered okay but it doesn t appeal to me. I prettied them up with an additional layer of maple flavor by brushing on more maple syrup I had reduced to a thick consistency onto the baked muffins. So now I m ready for the taste test. First of all my caved in muffin (which I cleverly tried to disguise with a sugar acorn decoration) fell apart into a plate full of cakey crumbs! Moist crumbs tho so I ll give it that anyway. And for all the maple in these muffins the Grade B syrup the maple extract and the glaze of concentrated maple syrup they weren t very maple-y at all. The taste was ok oat muffin-like and not too sweet but I have a rule for myself and my baking. If I don t feel confident giving something away (mostly for pride reasons) the recipe is a failure for me. I will not give these away.",

I also cut back the salt to a healthy pinch. I've cooked with oatmeal before so I knew to mix all the wet ingredients together, then add the oatmeal and let it sit for 15 minutes to soak up some of the liquid. After that, I folded in the sugar and the remaining dry ingredients. I was able to get 11 smallish muffins from this recipe--I baked them at 350* for twenty minutes. VERY dark looking muffin but they smell incredible. My issue with this recipe was that the muffins were quite sweet, for us adding the additional brown sugar was overkill. I'd like to make this again but omit the brown sugar completely. As is, a solid muffin recipe.",
