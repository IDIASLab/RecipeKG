My husband and daughter agree:) It is delicious as is but I could easily see it without the nuts and marshmallows and it would still be delicious. The only issue I had was when I mixed the egg in after removing the pan from the medium heat - next time I will allow the mixture to cool slightly before adding the egg because the egg cooked a bit. It didn't affect the end result but I didn't like having cooked egg in the mixture. When I took the bars out of the oven they looked very raw in the middle but I took them out anyway. After about 2 hours they did firm up and were perfect. I personally liked them even more the next day! I can see bringing these to gatherings and bake sales with great success!",

Stir till mostly melted. Add beaten eggs and vanilla. Stir again well. Add flour and baking powder gradually, stirring all the while. Add marshmallows and chocolate chips, mixing well. I don't always include the nuts and I don't add salt. I like that you only have to dirty one saucepan; don't even use a bowl.",
