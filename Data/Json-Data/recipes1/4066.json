It wasn't too sweet or heavy so it didn't overpower the delicious flavors of the banana cake. I will definitely be trying variations of this recipe using chocolate cake for a traditional Suzie-Q cake. Also I'm going to try adding in a bit of peanut butter to the frosting for a PB Chocolate treat I know my family will appreciate. Thanks so much for sharing this one!",
