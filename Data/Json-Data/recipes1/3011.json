We found a reference that these tarts were named for the maids of honour of Queen Elizabeth I. These tarts were delicious and a big hit with the kids and teacher in my son's class. I used mini-muffin tins kept the oven rack at the regular position and had good results using 10-12 minutes baking time. Also since I used the mini-muffin tins I reduced the amount of jam in each tart probably to about 1/4 teaspoon. Wonderful taste and yummy combination!",
