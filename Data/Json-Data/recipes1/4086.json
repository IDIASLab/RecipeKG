That is a long range....Anyway, cooked first batch at 300 for 12 minutes, not long enough.  Second batch at 300 for 14 minutes, cooled completely on baking sheet, much better.  Third batch at 350 for 12 minutes and they were perfect!  They don't spread as much at 350 and brown much better than at 300.  Will make again with changes.",

I doubled the recipe because in our family, the first dozen is gone right off the bat and the original recipe said it made 2 to 3 dozen...not nearly enough for us.  I used parchment paper like others said to do, and I could tell they would stick if you didn't.  I scraped the melted toffee off the spatula after each batch because if I didn't, it would mess up the next batch of cookies.  Also, even though I doubled the recipe, I only used an 8 oz bag of toffee bits and that seemed to be enough.  I also added in a small amouth of dark chocolate chips.  And, as another reviewer said, I added a small amount of butter flavored crisco in with real butter to make softer cookies.  The flavor of these cookies is wonderful and I'll definitely be making these again!  Thanks for such an awesome recipe, Lori!",

I wanted a little milk chocolate in these so I used an equivalent amount of chopped Heath Bars for the toffee bits and almonds for the pecans which for me was a better match. As I stirred it all in it seemed there was very little cookie batter and lots and lots of chopped up Heath Bars and nuts but it worked. I'm sure baking these at 300 degrees works out just fine or the submitter wouldn't have directed to do so but I was more comfortable baking them at 350 degrees and that worked out well for me. They're not overly sweet which paired with the crushed toffee worked out to be just right. They're not the prettiest cookie I've ever made as I like them to be symmetrical but they sure do taste good.",
