                "reviewBody": "I've been doing something very similar to these for several years now.  If you like your potatoes crispy, after chopping them, dry them thoroughly on paper towel before adding the oil.  I put the potatoes in a gallon ziploc bag, then add about 1.5 T of extra virgin olive oil.  Generally speaking, the less oil you can use, the better the result.  after tossing the potatoes in the bag with the oil to coat, add the herbs.  I use dried Herbs de Provence, but almost any herb or blend will work, and kosher salt.  Those on reduced sodium diets can omit the salt and add a bit more herbs.  Toss to coat again.  I also I use a dark cookie sheet lined with Aluminum foil.  When opening the bag, dump the potatoes on the foil lined sheet, but DON'T dump the excess oil in the bag onto the sheet.  The dark sheet absorbs heat and transfers it to the aluminum foil, and the aluminum foil itself provides easy cleanup.  Bake for 20 minutes initially on 450\u00b0 on the middle rack Then take the pan out of the oven, and gently turn the potatoes.  This will keep them from sticking to the  foil later.  Reduce the heat to 400\u00b0 and   cook for another 15 minutes.  A convection oven will yield a bit crispier results, but with only a small reduction in cooking time.  Don't open the oven except to turn the potatoes.",

I added garlic powder, italian seasoning and a little parmesan cheese to the mix.  I also used olive oil (they needed more then 2 T). I doubled the cooking time(I like mine crispy on the outside) and gave them a stir about half way through cooking.  I had fresh rosemary on hand so I used that instead of dried.  Also, I've found I have better luck with keeping them from sticking and getting them crispy if I use a metal baking pan (rather than glass).",

After making these 4 or 5 times I went in search of a different recipe because I wanted something that didn't dry out as badly or stick to the foil. They are good but tasted basically the same as my home fries I make on the stove-top and not so much like the roasted potatoes I get in restaurants and love. I have now taken some techniques from another recipe and use them with this one. Here's what I suggest: Use baby potatoes and cut each in half. Simmer halved potatoes for 6-7 mins to soften and infuse with moisture so they don't dry up during baking. Line the baking sheet with foil and drizzle olive oil over the foil to lightly coat then place each potato half on the foil cut-side down. Brush potatoes with excess olive oil from the pan then season and bake. Now my potatoes turn out PERFECT every time -- nicely carmelized crispy skin soft on the inside not at all dry and they don't stick to the foil!",
