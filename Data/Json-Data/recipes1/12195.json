This recipe was handed down to me from my dad who liked to eat this alone as a main dish, so it's a little heartier than most other sweet rice recipes. For those of you who know what Chinese sweet rice is, this is the most awesome tasting recipe yet!",

Chinese Sweet Rice is always made with a short-grain rice called glutinous rice (aka sweet rice or sticky rice). Jasmine rice is a long-grain rice and will not yield the sticky consistency.

However the phrase \"sweet rice\" is also applied to Jasmine rice because it is named after the sweet-smelling jasmine flower of Southeast Asia. Jasmine rice has a naturally distinctive scent released during the cooking process and is likened to a flowery perfume. In addition the ingredients in this recipe go perfectly with a rice grain such as Jasmine rice that can separate without difficulty. It makes it easier to combine the ingredients in this dish in such a way that each bite can blend the various flavors. Don't forget: Wok at least three times a week for a healthy heart!",
