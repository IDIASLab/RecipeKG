I also like to brush the crust with milk and sprinkle with granulated sugar before I bake it. This makes for a very pretty presentation and a tastier \"bone\".",

                "reviewBody": "I found this identical recipe in a McCall's magazine around 1980 and have made it several times over the years.  Fortunately I have three grandchildren (two are twins just two and a half years old) and they're crazy about raisins in any form so they love this.  I've always liked the flavors of orange and raisins together so I make a little orange glaze and drizzle it over the top of this and everybody likes that too.  Just combine a little powdered sugar and some frozen concentrate for orange juice, or else some grated orange rind and water with the powdered sugar.  I've used lemon juice in place of the vinegar once or twice but never noticed any taste difference.\n\nA word of caution:  when you bake most fruit pies such as apple, blueberry etc. you don't remove the pie from the oven until the filling starts bubbling out of the slits in the top crust.  That ensures that your filling is \"cooked.\"  But with this pie the filling is already cooked before you pour it into the shell, so all you're doing is baking the crust.  Cornstarch reacts negatively to being \"cooked twice.\"  In fact it \"breaks down\" if cooked a second time.  So with this pie, follow the timing suggested and take the pie out of the oven as soon as you're satisfied that the crust is browned to your liking and don't wait for the filling to \"bubble up\" through the slits.  The second cooking may cause the cornstarch to break down and you'll have a runny filling.",
