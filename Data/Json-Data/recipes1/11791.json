I'm not real crazy about raisins so I only put in 3/4 cup and it was still too much will try 1/2 cup next time.

The only changes I made was that I put it in a regular pie crust (I had an extra) as opposed to using the graham cracker crust and I made a streusel topping out of 1/3 cup flour 1/3 cup brown sugar a teaspoon or two of cinnamon and 2 Tb. cold butter. Everyone raved over this...I'll definitely make it again!!!:) Thank you!!!",
