I proofed the yeast in the warm water & a teaspoon sugar for about 10 minutes, then added the remaining ingredients, with these adjustments: I didn't have nonfat dry milk so I replaced about 1/4 cup of the water with 1% milk; used 1 T fresh rosemary, minced; I only added 2 cups AP flour, then added in a little more as I kneaded the dough. After kneading about 5 minutes I let rise for about 45 minutes, then shaped into the rolls & let them rise about 45 minutes. I did not brush with anything before they baked but did brush with melted butter when they came out of the oven. These are some of the finest dinner rolls we have ever tried. They are tender with a delicious chewy crust, fragrant, and savory--the perfect bread for the Brown Sugar Meatloaf, also from this site. Excellent and easy recipe going straight into my 5-star recipe file!",
