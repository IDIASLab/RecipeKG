We think it will be more appealing with a golden broth color instead of the red of a vegetable soup. Also I substituted spinach for the cabbage because all wedding soups I have had previously used spinach. Very good basic recipe easy to tweak. Thanks.",

I used boneless chicken breasts only (about 3 pounds) and 2 pounds of ground sirloin. I omitted the celery because we aren't a huge fan of cooked celery. I used 2 Russett Potatoes UNPEELED instead of sweet Potatoes and I did cube them (not too small). I didn't use any cabbage I instead used baby spinach coarsely chopped (NOT a whole bag..about half a bag) I also added alot more chicken broth when everything was in the pot to start cooking together. I added water also and ONE cube of chicken bouillon. I just eyed how much water and broth I needed to make a soup. I used about 2.5 tablespoons of basil oregano and garlic tomato paste. When I made the meatballs. I seasoned the meat also with alot of Slap Ya Mama cajun seasoning garlic powder. I also used Italian bread crumbs NOT plain. The soup as a whole was seasoned with fresh cracked pepper SYM and garlic powder..LOTS of it for flavor..also a pinch of Red pepper flakes. I added the spinach towards the end too. when the chicken was cooking with the onion..I seasoned that also. I used aged Parmesan and aged Romana. THIS soup was VERY Good. it made ALOT and i served it with cheese rolls.",
