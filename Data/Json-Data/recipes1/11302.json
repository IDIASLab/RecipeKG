So a quick search revealed this recipe. I always find it difficult to make something I never had before. I followed the recipe exactly not knowing what to expect and they were excellent! Probably the most difficult step is chopping the dates as they are pretty sticky. If I made it again I might reduce the amount of butter as these were literally dripping while shaping into a strawberry. Or I might add more rice stuff to soak up the butter. I can't wait to set these on the table for my mother-in-law as it will no doubt bring back a lot of fond memories. I'll get some major brownie points with this! Thanks for a great recipe!",
