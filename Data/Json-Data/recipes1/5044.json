My husband gobbled it up!  Great for a meal you don't want to spend much time preparing.\n\nLater note:  I've made this multiple times, and lately decided to try something new with it.  I used chicken pieces instead of breasts, since I had a package on hand I needed to use, and I put this all in the slow cooker rather than the oven. I used fat-free Catalina and no-sugar added apricot preserves.  I also added some minced garlic (from a jar).  WOW!!!  I think I liked the flavor even better this way, and the chicken was incredibly tender.  The minced garlic added a little something extra that made the sauce incredible.",

It's a family favorite and I often make it with whole chicken cut into eighths or just boneless, skinless chicken thighs for pot luck dinners and as my contribution to parties.  I recommend if you can find it to use Wishbone RED Russian dressing.  Much less sweet taste than the pink Russian dressing.  I live in Morris County, Denville, NJ and the Key Foods Store has this brand. I have recently found the Wishbone Red Russian dressing in the local Shop-Rite markets. I also use Lipton Onion Soup Mix.  I have tried other brands and found them too salty or to intense taste of dried onions.",

Very tangy... I also used this on chicken strips instead of breasts which cut down the baking time to 30 minutes & was very tasty",

So I made this \"as written\" the first couple of times and served it over brown rice. Always one to experiment I added a few touches the third time I reached for this gem-of-a-recipe. Here's what I did: Lots more chicken (family pack). Used only one pkg. of dry onion soup mix to which I added: the apricot preserves; 1/3 C. good-quality DRY Sherry (please not \"cooking Sherry\"); 1 tsp. DRY mustard; 1 tsp. ground WHITE pepper; and 1 C. raisins. Also I used \"Light\" Catalina Dressing. The beauty of this though is that Shirley's recipe is delicious as it is. But if you have some extra time and want to add a bit of flare the sky's the limit! Cook time can be less like 45 min. so be careful or chicken will dry out. Thank you Shirley.",
