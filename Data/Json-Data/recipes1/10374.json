I prepare this recipe excluding the chocolate chips and end up with a lovely, moist cake which doesn't need frosting and keeps for a couple of days (if it gets the chance).  I've cooked the batter in every shaped pan imaginable, including a shaped birthday cake for my daughter, without any problems.  Obviously the cooking times varies slightly depending on the pan.  It even works well in muffin tins or patty pans - these are great to keep in the freezer!  Our favorite way to serve it is to cook it in a fluted ring tin, when cool fill the centre hole with with berries or cherries and dust with icing sugar.  It lookes as luscious as it tastes.  Most family and friends who know about my daughter's allergies cannot believe this cake is allergy friendly, and many use the recipe themselves.  In addition, while it may not be fat free, it is easily made cholesterol free by using the right kind of oil.  A thousand \"thank you's\" to the person who submitted this recipe - you've ensured that we have an option for a delicious cake for a little girl whose diet is restricted in so many ways.",

For my personal taste it needs a bit of frosting the sweetness will accentuate the chocolate perfectly. To everyone who had trouble with gritty cake I would tell you that you didn't mix it enough. I whisked mine for at least 3 minutes. If it doesn't look just like normal cake batter you need to mix more if it looks oily on top with bits of crumbs inside keep mixing. This is a new keeper recipe for me!",

The only problem I found was that no one really said how much it made. This will make the 8X8 pan listed but that is only about 12-14 good sized cupcakes. I ended up having to go back and make a whole new batch for the 24 I needed. Well worth the effort. Perfect!",

I ASSUMED it was done (which it should have been) and it was all gooey and gummy on the inside and bottom. I followed the directions perfectly and it turned out horrible! A WASTE OF TIME!
