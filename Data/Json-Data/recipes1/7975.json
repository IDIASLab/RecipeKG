The only things that I did different was to replace the parmesan with monterey jack cheese (dad hates the stinky cheese) and add some minced red peppers for color and some added crunch. I also added some more of the spices until I was happy with the flavor and let it all sit in the fridge overnight which I think made it all the better. Can't wait until Christmas to serve it again!",

I used fresh chives from my garden about 1/8 cup but it didn't give it much flavor so I added a slice of diced onion to it too. 1/2 tsp worsh. sauce? I put in a full tsp and still added more after that. I took it that way and got complaints from the family asking why I didn't put any beef in it. This is a very bland cheese ball.",
