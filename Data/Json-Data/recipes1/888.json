I use the recipe below - it makes a lot but I think people looking to recreate an old favorite might need to make the couple of changes as I have below! 12 ounces of chocolate chips 12 ounces butterscotch chips 18 ounces creamy peanut butter 1 cup margarine 6 ounce package of vanilla pudding (not instant) 2/3 cup milk 2 pounds powdered sugar 1 pound salted dry roasted peanuts Melt chips with peanut butter. Spread half of this mixture on the bottom of a greased cookie sheet and chill. Combine margarine milk and uncooked pudding powder. Boil 1 minute. Add 2 pounds of sifted powdered sugar. Spread over chilled base and chill again. Then add 1 pound of peanuts to remaining chocolate mixture and spread on top of base. Cool again. Cut into very small squares. Store in refrigerator or freezer. Serve at room temperature. Note: I divide filling mixture after powdered sugar is added and stir in 1 teaspoon maple flavoring and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to each half",

That is the way I've seen it printed in several of the community/church cookbooks I own as well as on various web sites. I made this to try and recreate a childhood favorite. They are extremely sweet but tasty. The recipe I used calls for a jellyroll pan. You can cut them very small and it makes a huge amount. They do freeze very well.",
