I was rather disappointed and quite honestly disgusted with the finished product. All you could really taste was an overwhelming wave of butter with a slightly sour taste from the cream cheese. The preserves only manifested themselves as a sickly sweet taste that you couldn't distinguish the flavor from. And just as a heads up you can NOT put these in the fridge even for 5 minutes to set frothing. They practically melt into the plate and your left with a gooey mess to scrape off the plate and into the trash. Out of 2 dozen cookies I only managed to salvage 10 of them which turned out to taste awful. I will not be making these again.",
