I tossed the beef in 3 Tbsp. regular flour with lemon pepper chili powder and garlic powder. I browned it with a little olive oil. I put it in the crock pot (because I needed my oven for other baking) and it turned out fine. The other change I made was using 1/2 c. V-8 and 1/2 c. bloody mary mix. I thought it would give it a little kick and it did. In the last about 20 minutes I added a cup of frozen peas for some color. Along with lots of salt and pepper it turned out great. This recipe is a great base to build off of and add whatever you like for flavors!",

NEVER open oven door and peek as heat goes down and takes a long time to raise back up. Just throw in oven and forget it for 5 hours!!",

I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing next time. My husband is Irish and very picky about his stew. He loved it and it will definitely go into regular cirulation at our house. (He would like me to specify that he's from Ireland not a \"Plastic Paddy\" - a term used to describe an American who claims Irish heritage. No offense to those of Irish heritage!) You know what this seemed like? Each piece was coated with a delicious thick sauce the same way a Chinese dish like orange chicken is but the dish is not overwhelmed with sauce. This was so appetizing that I couldn t resist it and I don t eat beef! Next time I'll take a picture.",

The veggies needed some seasoning and were a tad bland. But overall this is a WINNER RECIPE! Incredible stew and so easy.
