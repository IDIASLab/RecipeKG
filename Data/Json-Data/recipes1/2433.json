It turned out to be even better.  Changes include using 4 oz. baby bananas for 1/2 C of the oil; used 1/2 C canola oil.  Added 1 C sugar and 1 C splenda; could not tell the difference in taste/texture.  Saved hundreds of calories with these 2 changes!  I drained the 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple and used the juice to plump 1 C seedless raisins (drained them well on paper towels and tossed with 1 tsp. flour).  I omitted the nuts, too.  End result was a delicious, lower fat and sugar fruity loaf!",

Because my family is crazy about pineapple, I added 1t. imitation pineapple extract and I toasted the walnuts.I used the cinnamon I had, which is the Makara variety, and that added a more cinnamon-y taste as well.

I used a whole can of pineapple which left about 1/3 cup juice to mix with two tablespoons of sugar and poured over top of the hot loaves when they came out of the oven. Not moist enough for you? Make sure you DO NOT take the moisture out of the zucchini! Also when you compare ingredients to other recipes that have rave reviews about their loaves being moist you will see that there is a larger percentage of oil in moister loaves. Add a wee bit more oil or applesauce to moisten it up a bit. I made according to directions with the pineapple glaze and it was quite moist and had a nice sweet pineapple taste!",
