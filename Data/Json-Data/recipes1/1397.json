This is a great recipe but is not for the impatient baker or for the faint of heart: there are a lot of steps involved including making the caramel. I made a wet caramel instead of dry because I like controlling how dark it becomes--and I added a splash of Kirsch because I like liqueurs with fruit. I used butter for the shortening and only used half the dough because I had a smaller springform pan I wanted to use. It was still too much dough for the pan--my fault--and I baked it on a baking sheet because I had a hunch the topping would bubble over which it did. Lastly: I prepared the cake the night before and let it rest overnight in the fridge before taking it out and letting it rise a little before baking. Very impressive for brunch. I'm going to try it again with the rest of the dough using apples and a splash of Calvados in the caramel.",
