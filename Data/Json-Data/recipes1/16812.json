I was trying to explain to my boyfriend how hard it is to peel butternut squash, and I equated it to cutting down a tree with a butter knife - this tip made the job SOOOO easy.  I love you, wonderful poster.\n\nThis recipe was so easy and so good.  I made three small changes - I added petite red skinned potatoes to the mix (cut the same size as the squash), added some fresh thyme and roasted the veggies just a bit longer - 40 minutes instead of 25.  \n\nI couldn't stop drooling and neither could my BF.  Definitely a keeper recipe!  Oh, and it tasted great the next day, too.  Yum.",

I removed the skin of the squash and then cubed it.  Then I tossed it with the fresh ground pepper, drizzle of olive oil (probably closer to 1 tblspn), coarse sea salt and minced garlic.  I prepped it around 11am and stuck it in the fridge.  Come dinner time I pulled it out, placed it on a baking sheet lined with foil and baked for 30 minutes at 400 degrees.  It was delicious.  I told my 3 year old son how a local \"FARMER\" had grown it just for him to eat and he gobbled it up.  Eat great Fall veggies until you are so tired of them and then do it all again next fall.  They are nutritious and delicious and cost effective when in season.  I paid $2.00 for a large squash that will roll over to another meal.  ENJOY!!!  This one is going in the cookbook under \"Side dishes\" : )",
