I also seasoned the chicken very well before browning which will come off into the soup mix when i put it in the skillet. I also cut up green onion to sprinkle on top for the last few miniutes as garnishment. Cream of mushroom is bland so definite recommend seasoning your chicken very well before browning and put black pepper in the soup mix to balance out the salt I used on the chicken. Very tasty. I will defeinitely make again.",
