It can be eaten on bread as sandwiches, or served over rice. Top with sour cream or French onion dip. The French onion dip is good if you want a little more zip to it. It is actually even better the second day.",

It's almost like a version we already did but we normally add 1/2 can of water or milk a splash of soy sauce and mix it in with some noodles. I will cut down on the bacon and add a splash of milk next time I make this as some other reviewers suggested. We also use a similar recipe to this but we top it with frozen tater tots and shredded cheese and bake it in the oven at 350 for 35 min. Oh the things one can do with ground meat and cream of mushroom soup. YUM",

To cut back on some of the heaviness I also did not add 4 slices of American cheese but used the shredded in a bag and again sprinkled over each sandwich rather than adding to the pot.",
