I use baharat instead of allspice just to give my baked goods a little different spin, and it goes perfectly here too.

No other reviews seem to mention how long this needs to bake, so I will.  15 mins at 425, and then up to 1 hr 15 mins at 350 (no fan).  It takes quite a while for the custard to rise all over, then you know it\u2019s cooked through.  Agreed with others, don\u2019t use a deep dish.",
