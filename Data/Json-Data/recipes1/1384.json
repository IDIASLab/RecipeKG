Not sure why the cake fell apart for one reviewer, but the flour amount is correct.  I'm a pastry chef, and can say that the graham takes the place of flour, both providing gluten and tenderizing.  The whites must be prepped as instructed, because they provide structure and lift to the cake.  If they're not properly whipped and carefully folded in, the result will be a dense cake with the wrong texture.  The yolks and all the sugar also tenderize, so you've got to really adhere to the recipe.",

There are a lot of steps to make the cake but they're not hard and they're well worth it. The frosting is a change from the buttercream my palate expects; the high butter ratio almost tastes like something is wrong at first but once I adjust my expectations I realize it's the perfect complement to the cake.",

I'm not a 'sweet' person by most standards (salt & cheese are my vices) by this recipe is amazing! \n\nI made cupcakes instead of a cake, which may have helped the rising / fluffy factor. When this recipe asks you to add sugar to egg whites and fluff, it's asking you to make a proper meringue. And you MUST make a proper meringue, or your cake won't rise at all - the air inside the meringue expands as you bake your cake, giving it rise and fluffiness. \n\nAnd the icing? Is ridiculous, caramel-y goodness. Not your traditional icing in the slightest. Yum! I took these to one of my classes and they just about died - have never gotten so many over-the-moon compliments as I did with this recipe! Thanks for sharing",

So very worth it. Tips for icing the cake: Yes the cake is very delicate so you want to make sure that your cake is cold before you ice it. Stick it in the fridge for a few hours it will make the cake so much easier to work with. Also if using a butter cream icing make sure you whip it lots & that it's warm. Whip the icing every few minutes if needed so it doesn't start to set on you.",
