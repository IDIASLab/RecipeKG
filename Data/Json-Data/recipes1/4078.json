If you make the recipe as described the sauce is about the consistency of milk. I recommend leaving out the 3/4 cup of water. I had to heat the sauce and add cornstarch to make it look like a sauce and not soup. Flavor's OK and it's not hard to prepare. It's a little bland. Add aged Parmesan double the mushroom and red pepper amounts and it's OK. I've invented better pasta dishes from what's on hand though.",
