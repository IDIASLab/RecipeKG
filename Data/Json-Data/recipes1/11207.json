I would just like to address those persons who are unhappy because of the name and claim it is not \"authentic\" Boston Baked Beans.  This recipe was passed to me from my mother-in-law who passed away 11 years ago at the age of 87.  It was her recipe so I don't feel it is my place to change anything about it and still give her credit for the recipe.  She was a wonderful wife and mother who lived in the state of Wisconsin who when younger enjoyed cooking for her family and friends.  To her this was Boston Baked Beans.  She was not a fancy cook so to her, living in the age before computers and cooking websites, this was authentic.  Please just enjoy it and don't get so hung up on the actual name.  I continue to take this to group gatherings that rave about it and ask about the recipe.  To me this is what is important and not the actual name.  I hope many more people will try this and I know you will enjoy it regardless of the name. Copy the recipe, use it,and give it whatever name pleases you.  AJRhodes",

I added enough water to cover and set on low for 10 hours.  I like my beans thick, so for 2 hours I left the lid off and the sauce thickened very nicely.  I had many requests for this recipe.

On high, it took about 10 hrs for them to get tender and edible, so if you timed it so that they went in the crock pot before work, they'd be ready to go when you got home that evening, eliminating the need to be home for any cooking.  I pan fried diced bacon before putting it in the beans, to eliminate some fat.  I didn't have dry mustard, and I added some BBQ sauce and smoke flavoring to the mix.  It has a great flavor (just like Bush's Baked beans).  Just don't be in a big hurry to eat it, the beans definitely take awhile!  If you're dying for homeade baked beans, just substitute canned navy beans, and you can skip the soaking and 10 hours of simmering.",
