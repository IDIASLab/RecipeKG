I used dried ground ginger and garlic b/c I didn't have any fresh. (I decided to make this last minute and didn't have time to run to the store.) I also had no pepper sauce so I just added some chili pepper red pepper and paprika spices. I also used dried oregano instead of fresh. I also added a little fresh cilantro just b/c I had a lot of extra in my fridge. I cut the chicken into cubes and put on kabobs. It was really delicious. Thanks for the recipe...and for all of those who try it don't be afraid to used the dry ingredients like I did mine tasted great!!",
