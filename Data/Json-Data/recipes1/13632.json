I searched the internet, and I liked this recipe because of the roasted squash- this makes a huge difference in flavor.  Let me tell you what I did for the resturant, and how I modified it at home for my family.  First, for the resturant:\n\n2.5 lbs (40 oz) of butternut squash, peeled and seeded\n2 large yellow onions, quartered\n6 cloves of peeled garlic\n1 2\" piece of fresh ginger, peeled and cut into 4 chunks\n2 cups of chicken stock\n2 cups of heavy cream\n2 tsps of salt\n1 tsp of white pepper\n1 tsp of medium curry powder\n2 tbs. of chopped fresh cilantro\n1 tsp. of cinnamon\nSour cram and cilantro for garnish\n\n1. Roast squash, onions, garlic and ginger until brown and soft- over an hour, depending on your oven\n\n2. Puree in your blender or food processor with chicken stock until completely smooth.  Should be done in batches.\n\n3. Heat on medium heat- add salt, pepper, curry, 1 tbs. of cilantro, and cinnamon (cinnamon can be a spice that enhances sweet or savory dishes- don't be afraid of it!).  While the mixture is hot, but before it bubbles, slowly add the heavy cream.  Add until it is the desired color and thickness for your taste, and allow mixture to bubble.  Lower the heat, and continue to cook on low flame for another 10 minutes.  Remove from heat, and let rest for 10 minutes.  Before serving, add a dollup of sour cream and sprinkle the rest of the fresh cilanto on t",

Have used it several times since and am working on coming up with some short cuts which may allow it to obtain better ratings on the quickness & easiness ratings. As for the kid-friendly rating who cares? Not everything is for children who are notoriously fussy eaters and should not be catered to as they have no sense of taste and should be ignored in terms of culinary aspiration.

I recommend substituting the yogurt with coconut milk; nixing the oregano cinnamon and nutmeg and bayleaf and instead using extra garlic 1 inch of fresh ginger root (finely minced) and 1 -2 T. of sweet curry powder and a dash of cayenne pepper for bite.

Well after all of that it turned out terrific! My husband proclaimed it his favorite yet! Then 2 weeks later I roasted the veggies and must admit it was even better than the first time! So if you don't want to \"mess\" with roasting as some have suggested- don't- boil it and run it through the blender/food processor and you'll have a definite keeper recipe! But if you are patient and roast everything you will be rewarded handsomely for your effort! My husband and I thank you for this terrific low cal meal!",

I used 'World's Greatest Vegetable Broth' found on allrecipes.com for my vegetable stock it is HEAVENLY and compliments this recipe well! (I try to avoid store-bought stock because of all the salt.) I doubled the curry (and I used Sharwood's extra-hot curry and it really wasn't overpowering just gave it a nice mellow flavour if you can beleive it) and I alse added some baked apples and carrots to the puree. Tastes great even without the yogurt. Delicious!",

I decided to add some diced macoon apple but did not puree nor did I peel them. gave bits of color and that bite of sweet apple lends to the savoriness of the soup. No oregano..i always sub a bit of fresh cilantro. Excellent! Perfect for a cool fall day. Recipe followed exactly except omitted the oregano upped the curry to 1 1/2 tsp. and didn't add yogurt directly to soup; just used a dollop to garnish the individual bowl. Used cilantro instead of parsley out of personal preference. Used Lawry's salt instead of regular. I used 2-15 oz. cans of broth. Important to remember that each squash has a different water content so adjust accordingly. The buttercup used didn't have a high water content so added broth after everything else was pureed and added to the stockpot. Since the squash was exceptionally sweet I didn't need to add brown sugar. The dollop of yogurt added a nice creamy touch. Thank you for this wonderful fall recipe that I'll make seasons to come!",

                "reviewBody": "Wonderful! I used two medium squash since recipe didnt specify size of the one also I upped the curry powder and used coconut milk at the advice of another review in place of yogurt because I didnt have any. But these were my own person variations... This is just a great recipe with a perfect blend of spices. Other reviewers mentioned it being annoying to roast the veggies or that it dirtied all of their dishes but to the contrary I dirtied very few dishes and how hard is it to cut a few veggies and stick 'em on a cookie sheet? Only problem I had was being to imatient to let them cool before I scooped them into processor! Ouch!",
