So desperate for good home cooking that Hubs requested \"Thanksgiving Dinner.\"  In July.  In Florida.  With limited opportunities to get in the kitchen and cook I was only too happy to oblige.  Realizing I had no bread for stuffing (and didn't want to use hot dog buns in the freezer...) I first had to make a loaf of bread.  And then I had to cut the bread up into cubes, and dry it in the oven for about a half hour at 225 degrees.  Now I admit I've never made stuffing with homemade bread before, and I must say I did notice the difference - and in a positive way.  Nor have I ever used a recipe for stuffing, but just for grins I had fun trying this very basic recipe and found that other than being a little on the salty side, it is a good, reliable recipe for stuffing that newbies or otherwise inexperienced cooks will appreciate.  I love the addition of fresh herbs in this and these aromatics not only flavored the stuffing nicely but filled the kitchen with their wonderful aroma (well, that and a turkey breast roasting in the oven at the same).  Take a good, basic stuffing recipe like this one, with its inclusion of fresh herbs, prepare it with a good bread (homemade or other) and you'll be quite pleased with the results.",

I thought it was a bit dry, I was afraid to make it mushy, next time I will add more liquid and cook it less, I probably left it in the oven for longer because I baked it at the same time with turkey (350 instead of 375), but it WAS really good! I used 10 cups bread cubes(about 2cm-3/4inches big), 3 stacks celery, 2 medium onions, added 1-1 1/2 tsp thyme, I did not have poultry seasoning, so I added some rosemary, pinch of nutmeg, 1 tsp ground pepper, 1 1/2 cups chicken stock (I used cubes), poured over bread cubes, mixed, put into greased baking dish, and baked at 350F.",
