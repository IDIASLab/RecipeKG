Also, marinating overnight is great, but you should try this even if you only have an hour to marinate.",

My alterations to the recipe were; using balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar, using a grainy-type mustard (I used Beaver Deli Mustard) in place of dijon and then low sodium soy sauce.  Everything went into a ziploc bag, then into the refrigerator for 8 hours.  The flavor of the thinly sliced steak FAR exceeded my expectation.  The feedback I got from my family was, \"Mmm mm MMMM\" and \"mmM mMmmm MMmmMM!\".  I think that means its a keeper, thanks Connie for a fantastic addition to my recipe collection.",

One flank steak was marinated exactly as the receipe recommends.  The second flank steak was marinated using a good quality balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar and adding a 1/4 tsp of hot pepper flakes.  Barbequed them side by side and it smelled so delicious a few neighbors wandered into the backyard and stayed to have dinner.  While the red wine vinegar marinade was good, the balsamic vinegar marinade was voted far superior.  Served fajita style with roasted red peppers and yellow onions, avocado's, sour cream, warm tortillas and Mexican rice from Allrecipes.  Mix up a batch of margaritas and you have the makings of a fiesta!",
