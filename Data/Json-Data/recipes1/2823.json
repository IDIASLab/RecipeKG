Mine worked out fine this way. I also had my doubts about the accuracy of the recipe when it called to cream only a tbsp of butter with all that sugar but it turned out fine. The dough was quite sticky for rolling balls...I found that refrigerating it between batches and spraying nonstick spray on my hands (! ) worked best to keep it from sticking to me. My yield was 64 cookies made from approx 1 inch balls. Parchment paper also was great for these...",

They weren't spicy enough for me--I'd definitely add a few dashes more of each spice maybe even doubling it (especially with that lack of fat). I wanted to make these crisp (or rather crunchy) instead of soft and chewy but I think unless the gingersnaps were 1.5\" in diameter (which isn't a bad idea at all) they won't be too crisp especially in the center with the directed baking time. I don't see how you can make chewy cookies. I didn't try it but judging from the soft center of my crunchy cookies the texture would be more like a tough bread than a soft chewy cookie with such a low fat content. All in all a hopefully flavorful recipe for those who are looking for low-fat (It'd be or stars otherwise).",

If you like soft puffy & chewy gingersnaps then this is the recipe for you.:) We did like the flavor however (I added much more ground ginger & cinnamon to the mix). I agree with others that they are a little on the sweet side even with unsweetened applesauce so the sugar can definitely be reduced. Thanks for sharing the recipe! My hips & thighs thank you!:)",

They were gone by the day after I made them so apparently they are pretty popular with the rest of my family as well. We like cookies chewy and they were just perfect at six minutes. Very rarely has it happened that the given time in a recipe is actually how long I cooked it (our oven tends to run a little hot). I did find the dough to be a bit on the sticky side. It was pretty simple to deal with though. After every four or five cookies I rinsed my hands off in cold water and dried them. Piece of cake and worked like a charm. This recipe will be fun to play around with. I might try using honey instead of molasses and substituting spices just to see what I come up with.",

I baked them on parchment paper to keep them from sticking. I also used 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of clove in place of the Allspice since I didn't have any. I chilled the dough for 30 minutes after making it before trying to make them into balls to cut down on the stickiness that others complained about. With these adjustments it worked out really well. UPDATE: After seeing how the first batch turned out they don't spread at all and remain kind of thick if that's how you placed them. On the second batch I smashed each cookie's dough in my hand until it was pretty thin like a pancake height so that it would 'crip' more on this next batch. FINALLY PERFECTION: To add a little dash of extra sweetness without increasing the calories much I melted 3 TBS of butterscotch chips and used a pastry brush to brush each baked cookie with a little melted butterscotch. Now they are PERFECT! I'd give it a 4.5 star now.",
