I had eight English bangers and I used both a red and green pepper and one zucchini that I sliced in half lengthwise and then sliced up each half in semi circles. I also used some fresh sliced mushrooms and a large spanish onion because these were the vegetables I had on hand. Instead of water I used chicken broth and along with the salt and pepper I used a few good shakes of Mrs. Dash No Salt Added Garlic and Herb seasoning. Yes the sauce is a bit soupy but over rice it is delicious and I served some crusty buns to mop it up with. Very good recipe that I will make again. Thank you for sharing this one.",
