HEY... be sure to enter this chili in contests at work... it WINS all the time :-)  Last Friday I just won 1st place for \"Hot\"' category, and overall grand champion for receiving the most points from the judges.\r\nNow... I have a couple of BIG secrets to share with you about this recipe, that might make it EVEN BETTER.  When I entered it online in 2000, the use of brand names weren't allowed, so I'll try to enter them here so you know.  The salsa is actually PACE PICANTE SAUCE... Med. or Hot.  The chili seasoning I use is Williams Original (not available in all areas), I use one package per 2 lbs of ground beef... sometimes I throw in a little extra from another package.\r\n\r\nEnjoy! Best regards, Deb.",

I needed a new recipe for a chili sale at my work, and it needed to taste great.\r\n\r\nDeb's recipe did not disappoint. I used Pace salsa (I think it's called Chipolte???) with jalapenos for a little extra kick and added a can of Rotel tomatoes and green chilis.\r\n\r\nEveryone who tried it raved over the great flavor, and a lot of folks asked for the recipe. It had a little bit of a spicy aftertaste, but was mild enough to appeal to all but the pickiest eaters. My husband even asked me to make a batch for him to take to work Superbowl Sunday. I will never go searching for another chili recipe again! Thanks Deb!!!!!",

One 10oz. of diced tomatoes w/green chiles and one 14oz of tomato sauce because it needed it.  HALF a jar of chunky salsa (although I will do a taste test an hour in to see if I need more), half a jar of each DRAINED kidney bean, and half a can of ranch style chili beans (pinto beans).  They are the best beans on earth.  Added one can of drained mushrooms and 3/4 a can of drained corn.  After I browned 1 lb of meat, I put it in the crock pot for at least 2.5hrs.  Grrrreat!  We have it at least once every few months for the past several years!  Update: I now add things like diced green, yellow and red peppers which really adds to the taste (and gives it color).  Season with a few dashes of garlic, oregano, paprika, basil, sugar, and we're talking a real winner!  Our family eats it with rice the first night (fri), sat is \"let's be lazy day,\" so we eat it over hot dogs, and sun ...can you say football and fritos and chili over cheese!!  We're not obsessed w/this recipe ...really ;)",

I used 1 lb. ground chuck and 1 lb. ground turkey and added 1 can of pinto beans to the mix. Made a mistake and used the whole pack of the chili seasoning mix, but it came out tasting great.  I recommend using either fresh garlic or garlic powder because the taste to me is the best.  The nicest thing was that you could spice the recipe up or down depending on the type of salsa you used.  I just browned the meat and onions, and threw everything into the crockpot and forgot about it for 8 hours on low.\nCame home to yummy smells from the kitchen. Next time I will add green and read bell pepper.\n\nChili cheese fries?  You all are killing me!  LOL\n--------------------------------------------------------\nI originally wrote this review over 7 years ago, and It is still my go to chili recipe because it is so adaptable.  Chili season is approaching and I can't wait to make it again.  I wish I could give this 10 stars as it is that good........  BTW, I did have to indulge in those chili cheese fries and they were heavenly - as were the chili dogs and chiliburgers, and mexican omletes.  LOL\nDebzdoo, you are my chili queen!",
