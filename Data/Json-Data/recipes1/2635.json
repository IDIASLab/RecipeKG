I took someone's suggestion of making monkey bread with half of the recipe. Oh my gosh....It was delicious! I rolled the dough balls in butter and then dipped them in a brown sugar mix (1/2 cup brown sugar 1 tsp. cinnamon). Once they were out of the oven I poured on a glaze (powdered sugar water and almond extract). They were so delicious! I had to freeze that batch so I would stop eating them. It makes a great breakfast treat!",
