So, I made the next batch for the potluck and it was a HIT!  Everyone at work was asking for the recipe.  Even those who said they hated strawberries liked this recipe.  I used an entire 8 oz. tub of whipped topping.  Also, when making the jello, I dissolved the jello in 1/2 c. boiling water.  Then, I added 1 c. of iced water to the jello and then stirred the jello until the ice melted.  It was the perfect temperature to immediately top and refrigerate.  Also, it cut the four hour refrigeration down to about 2 hours.  Thanks for this delicious recipe!!!",

This is what works for me make sure you \"seal\" around the edges of your baking dish with the cream cheese mixture. So when you pour the jello part on the pretzels won't get soggy. Also once the cream cheese layer is on make sure it is room temp before pouring the jello part on. Mine jello was still a little hot when I poured it onto the cream cheese part that I had just taking out of the fridge and the hot jello cracked the cream cheese layer and seeped into the pretzels.",

The pretzel layer was fine but the cream cheese layer was way too thin and as someone else noted the way it s written it says to let the jello thicken a little bit and pour over. It ran right through to the pretzel layer and was also not enough to cover the cream cheese layer. Will look for another recipe for this dish.",
