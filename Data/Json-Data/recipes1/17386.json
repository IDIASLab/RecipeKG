Rinsed and cooled and sprinkled with a litte garlic salt and tossed in flour and pan fried (my preference over deep frying) in a mixture of oil and butter stirring until as crispy as you like it. I like to mix some Heinz 57 and sour cream together to dip them in. They were so tender juicy crispy and tasty. Thanks for the recipie.",

I mixed a dipping sauce which I have never tried with gizzards which I used Sour cream garlic powder & Crystal hot sauce. I was seriously scooping every last drop out of the bowl with my last gizzard. I will NEVER fry traditional tough chewy gizzards again! I can't wait to cook these for my Southern parents who are 73 years old. My Dad will complain that my Mom was doing it wrong all of these years! HA",
