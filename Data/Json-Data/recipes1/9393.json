But the problem with it was that they did not harden properly. I left them in the oven overnight and they were still soft in the morning. So I turned the oven on to 200 and left it in there for an hour. Then I lowered the temp in the oven to 185 and left them in for another 45 minutes. At that point the texture was right - they had hardened into that melt-in-your-mouth consistency that they are supposed to have. I was hoping that the leaving it in the oven thing would work because it makes for a very simple recipe - leaving it overnight oven off what could be easier and safer? But unfortunately this did not work. I will just have to keep looking for a way to bake meringues. At least I was able to salvage them by baking them longer.",
