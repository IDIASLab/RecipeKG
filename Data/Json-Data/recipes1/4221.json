The quantities called for really fills the 9x5 loaf tin so if your oven is unpredictable (like mine) it could be best to use a bundt tin. Otherwise the sides will be drier while the middle is still damp (not moist). I got a more evenly baked and moist cake with a bundt tin. If your poppyseed happens to be the hard kind (like the ones I got) you can soften it by soaking it in warm milk for about an hour. then just tip the drained poppyseeds in the batter after you've beaten in the eggs. Otherwise WOW! thanks Holly!",

Everyone who tasted it raved and it vanished in record time. I was concerned at the last stage about the syrup as I expected it to be much thicker. It has the consistency of water (maybe a little thicker) and I thought for sure the cake would be soggy. It wasn't! It was perfect. I suggest poking more holes to the side of the cake than the center as this syrup will moisten up the crust and balance the flavor. You must try this recipe if you like lemony delicious things!",

It baked up nice at 350 in a little over an hour.  I creamed together 1 c. of salted butter with the sugar and added 3 eggs vs. 5.  Since there was no rising agent I added 1 tsp. of baking powder and used 1/2 tsp. of salt.  I also added 1/2 cup of lemon juice and didn't use lemon zest.  It was delicious.  I have to agree with one of the other reviewers - it is much better the next day for some reason.  ",

It took about 60 min to bake in my loaf pan. I thought it turned out very tasty. Its the first lemon loaf I've tried so I have nothing else to compare it to...essentially the entire lemon flavour comes from the syrup that you add at the end....it looks like a lot but it is needed. I found that the top half of the loaf has more of the lemon flavour and is more moist compared to the bottom half.....but it's not really a huge issue...I think I will add more lemon juice to the batter next time and see what happens.(not that the end result wasn't lemony..it was) Definitely let the cake sit for 1 day before serving...it improves a lot.",

I also followed another reviewer's advice and creamed my butter and sugar extremely well. The result was the light moist wonderfully flavorful cake I was looking for. The only thing I will change in the future is the baking time. Using a tube pan I baked the cake for a full 60 minutes. Next time I will start checking it at about 50-55 minutes.",
