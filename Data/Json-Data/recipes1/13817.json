I did find a non-creamy pesto sauce mix (Simply Organic Sweet Basil Pesto - 0.53 oz) and used that instead. The directions on the packet said to use 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup water so I used that instead of the margarine and milk. To make it more rich in nutrients I used a whole 8 oz. carton of mushrooms and doubled the spinach. We topped it off with parmesan cheese and it was a delightful meal!",

I tried it with only two cans of tuna like a few reviews said, and because I wanted to make sure it was a good recipe before I used all of my tuna in it (haha), but I'll definitely use three next time. I sprinkled a little garlic salt and parmesan cheese on top at the end. It was delicious! Thanks!",

I also recommend adding some seasoning at the end to spice it up a little bit. The tomatoes really work well in the dish setting themselves apart from the rest of the dish as a refresing bite without being distracting.
