I also used fat-free half-and-half to replace the cream (milk works well, too) because there's enough fat in the peanut butter.  The half-and-half keeps it creamy.  I let the sauce sit for about an hour and it was great served with a stirfry of broccoli, carrots, and red pepper over noodles.",

I also added a dash of fish sauce. I replaced the chili sauce with 1 tsp dried red pepper flakes. I used dark soy just because it has a deeper flavor. I also replaced hot water with chicken stock. You can always add more stock to thin the sauce. For the garnish I used scallions and crushed peanuts.",

My boyfriend didn't like this (the PB was just too much for him BUT...perhaps if I had fed him the leftovers he might have changed his mind?;)) A couple changes: First I used 1/2c HOT chicken broth instead of the water and used only 8oz spaghetti noodles so that it wouldn't be \"dry.\" Second right before the noodles were done I tossed in a head of chopped broccoli into the water so that they would cook. Finally I fried up 2 chicken breasts in a little butter and chicken broth - cut them in chunks and placed them atop the pasta. The broccoli gave this color (and I love my veggies) the chicken added some substance and the noodles tasted - well - just darn good! I would have liked this a little spicier but I can play around with that more the next SEVERAL times I make this! Thanks a bunch Holly!",

We all ate it no one refused it but discussed the fact that I will never make it again. My son adds bbq sauce to everything so he said it was ok (with bbq sauce). I'm definitely glad I tried it we come across loved recipes that way we just won't \"try\" this one again.
