I only had one mid-sized fresh salmon steak (I was cooking for only myself) but left the marinade as is. I supposed if I was making the full recipe I would double or add more marinade. This fish was awesome! It wasn't spicy (I held back on the cayenne and I should of added more). I always eat my salmon with lemon and this tasted amazing on its own. I will definitely be making this one on a regular basis.",

Nice bite of spice, cilantro, garlic and ginger on the outside, perfectly moist, tender salmon on the inside.  My only change was to use Greek yogurt (all I had) thinned down a bit with some water.
