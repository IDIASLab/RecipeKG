                "reviewBody": "Thanks, Chef John! Oh boy, these are goooood. I've made some pretty good lemon bars in my life, but hubby and I both agree these are the best. The filling is very lemony, with a perfect balance of tartness and sweet. It set up wonderfully. I'm not 100% sold on the crust, as I tend to prefer one a bit more substantial and firm, but that is simply my preference. This crust is excellent, as long as you are aware it is more flaky than firm.\n\nTwo comments, though, and both on the crust. I'd suggest mixing the salt with the flour first, then adding the butter. I also had a hard time with the finger-wetting bit. The crust kept sticking to my hands. I gave up and dusted my fingers with flour, instead. MUCH easier.\n\nEDIT 2/9/14: I made the bars yet again (I've lost count how many times now) and changed the crust a little. Same ingredients, but mixed the dry ingredients in a food processor. Pulsed in CHILLED butter cut into pieces (like pastry crust), then lightly pressed it all into the pan. It came out perfect!",

I did double it because I have to gift at least half of it to someone else, and I knew my family would be very sad if they didn't get any.

However, the baking times listed were much too long for my oven.  The crust was ready in just 10 minutes, and the custard layer in about 18.  I never had the thin, white crust on top as the recipe describes; my custard got light brown and bubbly.  The powdered sugar did a fine job of hiding the bubbly, ugly top.  The crust stuck horribly to my non-stick pan (I did, indeed, oil it first), so be liberal with the oil or cooking spray.  I'll definitely keep practicing with this recipe until I get it right for my oven and equipment.",
