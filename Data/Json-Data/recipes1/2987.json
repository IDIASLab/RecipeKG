First I had to bake it for about twice as long. Second it wasn't terribly appetizing to look at. And third it didn't smell very appetizing. Hate to be so crude but it's true. I have had great success with most recipes on this website that have high ratings and was disappointed with this one. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever fixed but it certainly wasn't the best. The rice topping was really strange and I just didn't care for it. Had to cover it in more than 1/2 C cheese just so we didn't have to look at it. One last thing - I didn't even try putting it in a 9 inch pie plate. I can't imagine that it would all fit. I used a small casserole dish instead.",

A casserole dish works well if you do not have a DEEP DISH pie pan (a regular pie pan is too small). We skip the onion soup mix. As the recipe says use LEAN ground beef not the 80-85% type. We also add in 1 cup of mixed veggies into the beef mixture. Otherwise everything else is the same and it is always enjoyed by old and young alike. Serve with warm buttermilk biscuits and butter and you have a great meal.",
