I used brown rice to make it a bit healthier and I only used a sprinkling of cheese instead of the recommended amount.  Then I served it up with a dolop of fat free sour cream and home made guacamole.  It was fantastic.  The leftovers will be great to use as a burrito filling.  My husband is a diabetic and this recipe is chock full of flavor, protein and, since I used brown rice, has healthy carbohydrates for him to enjoy.",

The version I make takes a bit longer because I don't use instant rice:\nIf I have it, I like to use 6-8 bone-in skinless chicken pieces...season them and brown them in olive oil. While they're browning I also throw some sliced yellow onions in the pan and get them all nice a browned as well. Then I add the chicken broth and salsa (I always use the fresh stuff from the deli section of the grocery store packed with cilantro!!), also add 1 cup uncooked brown rice and 1 cup water..and as a nice nutritional bonus, a can of black beans. Turn to low, cover and simmer until the rice is cooked, about an hour, adding water if necessary. Cilantro is a yummy garnish. Also, if you use the small cubed chicken as in the recipe or just pick some chicken off the bone in my version..this makes amazing taco/burrito filling!",

Other than that I kept everything the same. I did not care for this but my husband and kids did--they ate every single bite. I served this with additional salsa and reduced fat sour cream and I made a black bean/corn \"salad\" to go with--the combination together was very nice.",

I used a Mexican blend cheese and to make the presentation a little better I chopped some green onion and sliced black olives on top and served with a side of light sour cream.
