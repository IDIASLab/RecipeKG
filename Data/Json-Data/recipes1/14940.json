I usually don't tinker with recipes the first time I make them but the directions seemed rather redundant with too many separate steps. So here's what I did: I marinated the shrimp for about two hours (it was the fully cooked peeled deveined frozen kind that I thawed under cold water) sauteed the garlic and onion in a bit of oil added the beans after a couple minutes than added the shrimp when the beans started to be crisp-tender. After about five minutes in the skillet I transferred all to a bowl which I placed in the freezer to cool quickly. At first bite I thought it might be better warm but I had forgotten the feta. With the feta added this was a wonderful cold salad! The garlic was not overpowering and the rosemary was a really nice subtle flavor. Thanks for sharing this recipe!",

It was delicious and since there was a little leftover we'll get to try it the way it was meant to be eaten too. I can hardly wait to try it with beans fresh from the garden.",
