This is from someone who doesn't even care to much for raspberries and it got a similar review from my uncle with the same feeling toward raspberries:0) I printed this recipe out in 2004 (sorry for the late review) and I have made this recipe numerous times. It is very easy and has come out PERFECT every time. The last time I made it I did not have any lemon juice so I used 1 tsp lemon extract and it was wonderful! Also I always use frozen unsweetened raspberries and mix all ingredients when the berries are still frozen. I make the dough and then when the mixture is completely thawed I fill the crust and bake. GREAT recipe - THANK YOU so much:0)",

I've never used it before and bought small pearl tapioca from the baking aisle. I figured it would bake it but no. It came out looking like tons of white BB's mixed in with the raspberries! It was like eating watermelon: chew spit chew spit! And it absorbed no liquid as it became raspberry soup. Had to throw out the whole pie. Did I use the wrong tapioca?
