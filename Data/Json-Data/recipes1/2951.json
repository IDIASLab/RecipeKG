I only added 1 cup of raisins and am assuming the pineapple is to be drained. I squeezed it out very well before adding. This is a thinner consistency bread so I was concerned that raisins would sink to bottom and slightly scorch but they didn't. Sprayed with \"Pam for baking\" spray and they slid right out of the pan. I do like a spicier bread so added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. I only had the small baby carrots so used 2 cups of shredded carrot. This is super moist and would make great muffins too! Could easily sub. shredded apple for the carrot.",

First off I was wondering if I should use crushed pineapple with juice because someone suggested it should be drained(actually I used pineapple tidbits this time because I had it on hand. It turned out very good! You can actually see those bits and really taste pineapple). Then I checked my favourite carrot cake recipe (it's on Allrecipes called \"Sam's Famous Carrot Cake\"). The recipe calls for \"with juice\" and also buttermilk as more liquid. So I decided to use the juice too for this loaf. I took many reviewers advice and baked @ 350F for 70 minutes. Wow! It was perfectly done! Usually if the batter has a lot of liquid it takes me so long until the inside is done but the outside is burnt. But this time it was no problem at all! I also tried another suggestion and used half white sugar/half brown sugar. And I used half all-purpose flour/half whole wheat flour and added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed which I usually do for quick bread. Super!!",

I used about a cup and a half of prepared matchstick carrots and omitted the raisins and nuts, as I didn't have any. I thought the recipe looked a bit \"wet\" and I was afraid that it might have an issue with being raw in the middle. I used one stick of melted unsalted butter and a half cup of vegetable oil instead of the cup and a half of vegetable oil. I also used two tsp., give or take, of pumpkin pie spice. I baked it at 350, instead of 375 because I thought that might be a little too high and cause the not-quite-done center. I was right. About 50 minutes took both loaves to be done perfectly. I also suggest to take a piece of foil big enough to just lay over the breads to keep from getting too brown on top. Very good! Very, very good. My kids inhaled this and asked for more. I'll be sure to make this again, but next time I will add the nuts and raisins.",

First off I did make substitutions--I made only one loaf and used half brown/half white sugar and 1/4 cup apple sauce in place of oil. These were suggested however and when I cooked it for 45 minutes in the 9 by 5 pan it looked great. However the next morning when I cut it up the middle appeared not to be fully cooked. I had checked it with a toothpick and it had come out clean. I did think this was good though and worth re-trying. Next time I will: 1) drain the pineapple 2)use (for one loaf) 1/2 cup oil (might replace it with apple sauce) 3) use a total of 1/3 cup sugar maybe less and finally 4) cook it shallower pan so it will cook more evenly. Just something for others to think about.",
