The idea of the recipe and the combo of ingredients are perfect the spicyness really sets it apart from other artichoke dips. I served it for dipping with Chip Chicken Lollipops from this site.",

It's a good thing I tasted the dip before adding the seasonings because it really did not need much salt. I ended up using 1/2 t seasoned salt no soy sauce the full amount of hot sauce (Frank's Red Hot Sauce) and 1/2 t garlic powder. We like things salty and garlicky but I know the salt would have been overpowering and I think the full amount of garlic powder would have been too. We're quite pleased with how the dip turned out with those changes though! It's great cold or heated in the microwave. Next time I'm going to try adding 1/2 package of frozen chopped spinach thawed and squeezed dry because when the dip is hot it's pretty thin. Plus we just love spinach artichoke dip. Thanks so much!",
