It was delicious, and enjoyed by all! The only deviation I took from the recipe is that I added the raisins and peanuts at the end so they weren't covered with the chocolate/peanut butter/powdered sugar mixture. Since I was serving this to others, I wanted to be sure that the peanuts and raisins were visible for those who may not want them. Great and easy recipe, thank you for sharing!",
