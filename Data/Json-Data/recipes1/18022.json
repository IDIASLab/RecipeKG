I ended up baking it around 75 minutes and it still needed to be baked longer.(I have yet to do that). You might want to reduce the amount of oil in the bread. I make bread regularly and for the amount of flour this recipe calls for (along with the milk, 3 eggs and 1/3 cup of oil there is really too much moisture. A few tbls of oil is sufficient if used at all because the veggies will have oil and water from cooking. If you want a crispy crust pour a few tabls of melted butter on top of the loaf after pouring the batter into the loaf pan. Otherwise great flavor and thanks for sharing!",

Then I had it for lunch cold out of the fridge with some red pepper sauce on top, very quiche-like, but also delish. Now I'm eating it for dinner, sliced somewhat thin, butter on both sides, pan fried, with melted cheese on top. Not only delish, but the best thing EVER. Pan frying it really knocks it our of the park. I did make a few changes to the recipe though. I don't care for swiss so I used sharp cheddar and fresh romano, added some herbs (thyme, rosemary, etc), and did not add the extra oil to the batter. It absolutely does not need it.",
