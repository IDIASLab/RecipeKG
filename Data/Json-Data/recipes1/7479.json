Temperature is VERY important and is why some have not had the brittle harden for them.  You need to use a candy thermometer and bring the mixture up to 300 degrees.  Then, REMOVE from heat and add 1 tbsp of butter and then the baking soda.  The butter should help it not over react and bubble over but you do want the bubbles because this is what makes the brittle, well, brittle! ;O) Also, warm up the pan that you will put the brittle into, this will also help it to spread.  Hope this helps everyone because this is a good recipe!",
