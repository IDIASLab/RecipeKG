Also use less Mayo for sure- just enough to hold it together. For presentation you can smush the folded together mix into a deep pie-type dish and put the chopped TOASTED walnuts on the top. Slice it like a pie and serve with a light veggie or lettuce for a super cute lunch. Our entire family LOVES this salad in this form there are never any leftovers. Some of the guys even put it on a roll for a sandwich.",
