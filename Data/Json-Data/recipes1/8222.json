Well, my aunt came to visit us last night from another state, and she is diabetic, so I skeptically looked up no-sugar-added recipes.  I saw how great your reviews were, so I decided to make it.  FANTASTIC!  Just as the other comments said, not only did she like it, so did everyone else!  My dad and husband are just as loyal to my mom's apple pie as me, but they both said this was AWESOME!  I hope you have more recipes like this one :)\r\nNote:  I used my Mom's \"Never Fail Pie Crust\" recipe, which is the BEST.  I will post it on this site!",

The only thing is my Husband is a diabetic and the concentrated juice is also considered a very high sugar so I decided to try it with just regular apple juice and it still turned out great.  Oh ya I also used Mac Apples instead of green ones (green ones are a little too tart for me). Thanks for the recipe. I'm going to try it with other fruits!!  I also made sure to put it into a cholesterol free pie crust so it was low in cholesterol too.",

I used super sweet Fuji apples instead of Granny Smiths and I'm glad I did because the pie was a bit tart even with the sweeter apples. FYI: the body metabolizes fructose (fruit sugar) the same way as sucrose (table sugar). So while BOTH INCREASE BLOOD SUGAR fructose is generally preferred because they usually come along with good stuff like fiber and vitamins while things made sugar are usually processed and lacking nutritional value (i.e. apples vs cake).",

I bake it every one to two weeks, and it barely lasts a couple days, at most.  I usually try and use at least three different types of apples, but always at least two.  This adds to the flavor of the pie.  I always use Granny Smith, and either Jonagold or Empire, or both.  I also add more cinnamon, at least half a tablespoon more.  Delicious pie!",

My mom who usually always wants things extra sweet said that it was the perfect pie! My family couldn't believe that it had no sugar in it! I used no sugar added granny smith apple cocentrate and granny smith and royal gala apples for the filling. When filling the crust with the apples make sure to remove the apples from the syrup because if you add too much syrup in with them it will leak a lot while baking. I used the best ever pie crust recipe on this site. Very easy to make and turned out great! Thank you for this recipe awesome!",
