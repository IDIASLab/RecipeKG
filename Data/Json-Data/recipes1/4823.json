You can also add green or white sauteed onions if you desire.  Adding some dry italian salad dressing mix to your flour will really help kick the flavor up a notch.  Don't forget to add cold water to your cornstarch!  The perfect partner for this is egg noodles.  A great recipe for weeknight or for company. Always a winner.",

I had to add a little more cornstarch and I used Mrs. Dash gralic and herbs seasoning in the flour mixture as well as with the chicken broth. I also steamed some broccoli and tossed that into the pan with the chicken and the mushrooms. Served over linguine and it was delicious and elegant. I will definitely make this again!!!",

I also added 1/4c fat free sour cream & a ton of pepper right before serving the dish. My family is full of picky eaters & they gobbled this up (after making sure there were no mushrooms visable on their plate!) The chicken was delicious & this recipe is a keeper!",
