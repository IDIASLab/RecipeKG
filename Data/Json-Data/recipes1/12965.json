AFter searching through tens of frozen and refrigerated pie crusts and homemade pie crust recipes, the whole dinner just seemed way too fattening, even with lowfat cheese.  So, we cooked the filling up as directed, added the cheese, and it was delicious all on its own!  We got some rolls to serve it with and it was a filling (and less fattening) dinner. I think I would serve it on brown or spanish rice next time! MMM!",

I also added a 1/2 can of corn and used slightly less than 2 cups of grated cheese -- a pre-shredded Mexican blend and an extra sharp cheddar. I didn't have a red bell pepper so I substituted with additional green bell pepper. After removing from the oven I recommend letting it sit 15 minutes or so before cutting otherwise it could be runny. All in all a tasty filling dish that I'll make again and again.",

In fact I added about a cup of salsa which really gave it some zip! I also went with half a red pepper and half a yellow pepper because both my sister-in-law and I both hate green peppers. I also used about two cups of Kraft's \"Mexican\" grated cheese and added a couple cloves of garlic (my theory is always that you can't have too much garlic). I didn't have any trouble with the crust -- it cooked fine without requiring pre-baking. (Except I used only bottom crusts.) I ended up baking this at 350 degrees instead of 325 because I was making it at the same time as the \"Awesome and Easy Creamy Corn Casserole\" (also on this site) and had absolutely no trouble with it. This was absolutely marvelous with the amendments I mentioned above! Highly recommended!",

I made the changes that were listed below adding 1 cup of salsa instead of 1/3 and adding 2 cups of cheese. I used Pace Thick n'Chucky Salsa but adding a cup was way too much. The bottom crust wound up being soggy with so much liquid. Next time I will decrease the amount of salsa. The additional cheese was nice but really unnecessary.
