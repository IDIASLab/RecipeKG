All you do is dump your ingredients together and let your ice cream maker do the rest.  I added 1 cup of sugar and found it to be too sweet; half a cup is plenty.  One word of caution: if you cut your peaches instead of puree them, your ice cream maker may \"freeze up\" as the chunks block the paddle from churning.  If you like little peach chunks, puree about 3/4 of the peaches and chop the rest.",

One should always lightly salt an ice cream to bring out the flavor!  1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon.  I found it rather funny the handful of reviewers who indicated that this recipe didn't have any flavor.  If your ice cream doesn't have any flavor the peaches you used were junk!  Probably store bought, pick green weeks ago, no aroma, no flavor, shipped hundreds, if not thousands of miles, mass produced junk!  When you're searching for the right peach, pick it up, hold it to your nose and sniff.  If there is an excellent peach aroma that makes your mouth water, that peach will be good to eat or use in ice cream, or a baked good.  If you smell little or nothing, the peach is junk and you might as well just use canned.",
