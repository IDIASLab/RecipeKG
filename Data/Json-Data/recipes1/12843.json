This dish is best served just after being made. I had leftovers and heated some up in the microwave the next day (I added a teaspoon or two of cream and covered it before heating)and the butter kind of seperated from it. It was still pretty good but not as good as it was when it was first made. Maybe it was the Smart Balance? I don't know. Irregardless it is a wonderful recipe!",
