I make cheese balls all the time for parties because they are easy and who doesn't like cheese!:) This is by far the best cheese ball recipe I have found. If your not familliar with caraway seeds they are very flavorful and are similar to the flavor of rye bread. I used extra virgin olive oil & some cabernet I had instead of the sherry. I also added an extra TSP of caraway seeds inside of the ball and rolled it as I always do in a mixture of walnuts and fresh chopped parsley. I made mine for a halloween party so I also added a few drops of red dye which gave it a fancy port-wine look. This cheese ball got devoured at my party and received many compliments. Delicious! Thank you!!!:);)",
