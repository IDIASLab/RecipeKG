I added just a touch of butter with the olive oil to cook the onions (adds some great flavour), seasoned the chicken breasts with salt and pepper before cooking, used half of the oregano suggested (not a huge fan) and used whole wheat penne pasta. I used reduced fat feta cheese which melted right away and created this beautiful, light, creamy sauce. Everyone that tried it absolutely LOVED it. I'm so thrilled that I found this recipe. I will be using this for many years to come. DEVINE recipe Lalena... thank you so much for posting!",

I also used a can of diced tomatoes..do not drain!  The marinade and juice from the tomatoes really helped keep this from being dry.  I was very surprised at how flavorful this meal was!  This is definitely restaurant quality!  The feta cheese really gave it that \"greek\" flavor.  My b/f referred to it as \"fancy\"!  Wasn't very difficult to make and took right at 30 min to prepare and cook! There is also a ton of leftovers..which will be perfect for lunch! Will be making this again and would recommend this to anyone!",

I make a few changes - I season the chicken with paprika, salt, pepper & onion powder. I frequently use fresh herbs from the garden. I use a can of petited diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I also add mushrooms and saute with the chicken. I saute this hard to get a nice coloring going on. I also add black olives. I don't add the feta until I mix the pasta with the chicken. I appreciate the recipe, we have really enjoyed it.",

Lastly the only artichokes I had on hand were the one packed in oil and they worked great as well. It probably added a few calories however I was able to cut a few out by using fat free feta cheese. So it probably evened itself out in the end. This recipe was ideal for a weeknight dinner because it was fast and delicious without a lot of cleanup.",

Both my husband and I thought it was even better than most of the pasta dishes we've had at nice restaurants.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.... I made it in my electric skillet and I changed a few minor things.  First off, I only used 1/2 pound of pasta.  We like our pasta to have more sauce and less noodles and since it's just the two of us, this worked out perfectly.  It was nice and moist and it still made enough for us to have leftovers the next day.  I used penne pasta, which is our favorite.... The other changes I made were: I used a yellow onion instead of red, I used a can of diced tomatoes (drained) instead of the chopped tomato, I added about half of the artichoke marinade along with the artichokes (for more flavor and liquid), I added 1/2 cup sliced kalamata olives (this made it REALLY yummy!) and I used double the amount of feta cheese (1 cup total).  I added 1/2 cup into the sauce and cooked it a little longer than what the recipe stated, so it melted down somewhat and made almost a cream sauce.  The other 1/2 cup I sprinkled over the top of the pasta/sauce mixture before serving it... I'll definitely be making this again and again and again!",

Really it does need a light tomato sauce, I also topped with fresh grated parmesean cheese. 5 stars, and I will be making this one often! Thanks for the recipe!!!!",
