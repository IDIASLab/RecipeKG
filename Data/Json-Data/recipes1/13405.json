Like another reviewer, I didn't bother taking the time to cut out circles and instead cut the tortillas into 4 triangles to avoid having scrap leftovers. This works perfectly because you can pull them out easily by the hangover corners when they're done, which are left golden and crispy, and it adds texture. If you have trouble getting them to sit right in the tin without popping out, hold them over steaming water for a minute or two allows them to get stretchy and they'll sit fine. (They dry back out in the oven anyway). With one of the batches, I baked the tortillas for 5 minutes, added filling, and then baked again, but I only it found it wasted more time to bake-fill-bake rather than fill-and-bake. There wasn't much difference, both ways were delicious! As for the FILLING: do anything! I've made vegetarian types with refried or whole black beans. I've also used ground taco-flavored beef, using a heaping teaspoon per serving. Topped it with salsa or simply veggies. Olives, onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, celery, jalapenos, corn, salsa: any combination that's available is great. anything that needs to be used I have left over in the fridge- works for me! Often heap some sour cream in there to be baked with it if the filling is very spicy. Use shredded CHEESE sparingly! The more shredded cheese you use on top, the soggier they get. Otherwise Excellent!!",

The cheese is needed in the mix to bind everything together while baking. The frustrating part was how to cut the tortillas so they will fit perfectly into the cupcake pan. I finally just cut them into triangles and that worked OK. The first batch I added the salsa into the mix but that made it too watery; so in the second batch I only added some tobasco sauce to make it a bit spicy then served the salsa on the side. And everyone liked that better. Easy to make and even with greasing the pan some of the tortilla cups still stuck to the pan because of the melted cheese but this is minor compared to the taste. Will probably make again and we liked how you can change the filling (more black beans more veggies and less cheese) and still it tasted good.",

Combined tips that helped: use a cup or cookie cutter to cut out mini muffin size circles warm circles in microwave to make them more pliable mix all ingrediants into a bowl and spoon into cups. I did find that I only had to spray the tin once and they fell out fine from then on. Also they reheated fine in the oven this morning. I put these out at 8am it is now 9am and there are 3 left! Not one person has said they don't like them! They are ridiculously good and oh-so-easy to make. Kudos to they're creator! Any weightwatchers members out there- the ingrediants that I used were 2 for 1pt 4 for 2pts and 6 for 3pts. And they are SO worth the 3 points! LOL",
