                "reviewBody": "My son goes to college at Northwestern in the Chicago area, so when he was home for a visit, I wanted to make an authentic stuffed pizza like the ones he enjoyed so much there.  This was a good recipe but we have some suggestions for improvement.  We thought the pizza dough would be better without the cornmeal and prefer our traditional pizza dough recipe.  Also, there was a complaint that there was not enough mozzarella cheese.  My sister, who lived in Chicago for years, said, \"Whatever it is, it's good,\" which suggested it was not quite like the Chicago stuffed pizzas she'd had. Also, I think it would be better to add the tomato sauce on during the last 5 to ten minutes of cooking so it retains the rich red color and does not look browned and dry, and it could use a sprinkle of parmesan on top.  As I made the recipe, my son advised me that sliced tomatoes must be included in the filling, and that was very good.  The next night, I tried it again, and this time made a sauteed fresh spinach, onion, and mushroom filling (not forgetting the sliced tomatoes), my usual pizza dough recipe, and a spaghetti sauce topping added during the last 10 minutes, more cheese, and it was given far better reviews.  Hope this helps!",

When the pizza is done all you have to do is take off the side of the pan and slide the pizza on a cutting board.  I used onion, red bell pepper, mushrooms and thawed, drained frozen spinich in my pizza. YUM This recipe took me much longer than the estimate given, but I will make it again.",

I am from a suburb of Chicago (born & raised) and frequent the city quite often (especially in my younger days) and I am TOTALLY going to have to disagree with MEMIAN that Chicagoans have to eat tomatoes on their pizza....wrong that's like saying that we ALL love the cold & snow. There are plenty of pizzarias that serve pizza like this here in Chicago. This is a great recipe I again used my corning ware quiche pan however I think it's about time for me to invest in a pizza pan. The kids & I thank you Mark!",

(even though i dont like vegis that much) you can put the onins green pepres and other vegis. its basicly just a pizza so put what you want in it.",

I also used about 14 to 15 ounces of mozzarella cheese instead of the 9 ounces this recipe called for. And I put a layer of ricotta cheese down on the pizza crust before adding the rest of the filler. Finally I only made a pepperoni pizza instead of using all of the vegetables this recipe called for. The combination of these three recipes with the few minor tweaks I made made for an EXCELLENT pizza!!! Very very tasty!!",
