I doubled the crust recipe the first time but that was a bit too much (despite the fact that I am a crust lover.) Increasing the recipe by 50% was perfect. I quartered the strawberries since I hate trying to cut fruit while I'm eating. I also added pie thickener (Sure jel? Can't remember.) so the filling wouldn't end up runny. I served this at a BBQ and one of the guest kept complaining how he didn't like nuts in his pie crust. Once he tried it though he fell in love with it and had three pieces. This recipe definitely puts all those plain Jane strawberry pies to shame!",

This definitely makes for a thick crust however the crust is so darn good! I ended up baking it MUCH MUCH longer than the recipe called for. I had NO problem with this staying together as a pie verses it being more cobbler like as some other reviewers experienced. The only other thing I did differently was I tossed the cooked mixture around with the fresh strawberries. I had used fresh picked homegrown strawberries for this pie. Mine was NOT soupy even 3 days later! I don't know if by mixing the cooked mixture around helped with that? This pie is a winner. The crust is awesome and the almond extract really compliments the strawberries! THANKS FOR SHARING!:)",
