I never have sauteed the onion and garlic and mine comes out just fine. I promise you if it was the least bit raw my husband wouldn't eat raw onion!! I do however chop it very fine with a Pampered Chef food chopper so that might be why. I do understand what one person said about the tortillas being a bit soggy...they are...but not enough to bother us. Perhaps if you toasted them under the broiler for a minute or two it would help?? This is a great recipe...give it a try.",

The cheese on top went lovely and crispy and turned the top tortilla into a giant nacho! The only reason it isn't five stars is because the other tortillas went a bit soggy for my liking.
