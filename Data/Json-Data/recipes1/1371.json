The first time I made this I was a little afraid of it as I'd heard from others how difficult it was but I've never had a problem. Fluffy white clouds of marshmallow like frosting cannot be used in a decorator's tube but can slathered on with a spatula. Once it's on I take the side of my spatula and \"pick\" the frosting all around making tiny peaks. This makes one of the prettiest cakes ever. I think the frosting is best eaten the day it is served as it can get kind of grainy and start to droop.",
