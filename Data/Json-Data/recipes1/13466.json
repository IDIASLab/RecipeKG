Cooked 8-9 minutes to prevent burning. Used Pam on the foil and I'm glad that I did. They were very easy to make- if you are using a flat cookie sheet be sure to turn the edges of the foil upward to keep the liquid which spreads out a lot during baking from overflowing. I did have some problems with my graham crackers \"shifting\" during cooking. Cut into triangles for a beautiful presentation. I found them slightly too buttery in feel and taste but still quite good.",

I was afraid it would taste burnt so as soon as it was nice and thick I spooned it over the crackers. Overall really good",

I'd do 1.5 times the sugar/butter mixture so they're thoroughly coated and definitely don't leave them in for 12 minutes unless you're doing it at a lower temp. My friend makes something similar but uses Saltines instead of graham crackers doesn't use nuts and puts chocolate chips on as soon as it comes out of the oven spreading them once they've started to melt so it's a pretty smooth layer of chocolate. Wicked good that way; so-so when done the way this recipe's written.",
