I was thinking it would somehow taste tomato-ey and not very good but I was very pleasantly surprised! It had a wonderful flavor without even a hint of the tomato sauce flavor. I could see making this salad with romaine lettuce or spinach leaves to add to the vitamin content:) I also plan on using the dressing recipe for other salads I make.",
