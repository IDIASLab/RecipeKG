I use half shortening and half butter instead of all butter and reduce it by at least a 1/4 cup. Also I add more coconut and instead of all semi-sweet chocolate chips I use a variety of whatever kind I have on hand. I usually use a mix of milk white butterscotch (i think the butterscotch really brings out the best in the cookie) and semisweet chocolate chips. I also add a little spice like nutmeg cinnamon cloves almond extract or whatever sounds good. Enjoy.",
