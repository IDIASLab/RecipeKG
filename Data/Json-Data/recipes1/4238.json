Because I was using asparagus already cooked crisp/tender I had to modify the cooking method a bit and I improvised on the recipe to a minor degree as well, but not so much as to significantly alter the intent of the recipe. I used half and half rather than the milk and sour cream and an equal measure of chicken broth. I also substituted shallots for the onion. I liked that this recipe limited itself to the clean and simple flavor of the asparagus, without distracting additions of garlic or other seasonings and it proved itself out. I made this ahead of time and it was easy enough to reheat once I was ready to serve dinner. To garnish, I sauteed scallops in browned butter, nestled one in each soup bowl, then topped the scallop with criss-crossed asparagus tips. Because of our frequent and extensive travel, hubs and I eat at wonderful restaurants all over the country, and we both declared this soup as fine as we've had anywhere.",

I use 1/2 tea more salt and a pinch of garlic powder. I puree in batches in my blendar.  Dont forget the lemon.  I always squeeze a tablespoon or so from a fresh lemon (never the reconstituded stuff it is not the same).\n\nI serve it with a dollop of sour cream and a touch of red pepper flakes to mix in.

I mixed things up a bit by adding my flour to the onions once they were just about done. I then added my broth a little at a time and whisked to keep it lump free. I then added two bunches of asparagus and simmered until tender. From there I pureed in my food processor and added the vegies back into the pot. I seasoned with my ususal garlic and onion powders, black pepper and lots of dried dill weed. I didn't see the need for the milk, so I just used a large dollop of low fat sour cream. I garnished with some of the tips and mad crostini on the side which made a beautiful presentation! The color is fabulous and the flavors are even better Holly.
