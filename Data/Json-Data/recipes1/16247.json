I knew this would be a good one just by reading and as such, only modified slightly! \n\nI left tomato amounts as written but also added some sliced Bella mushrooms and chopped sweet onion.  Because I had an extra pound + of veggies, doubled the chicken broth, balsamic and oil - leaving red pepper flakes as written. Added 1 tsp dry oregano (IPO fresh as I had none) to tomato mix prior I placing in the oven. Started linguine halfway through (not in the last 10 min - you need time to bring water to a boil!).  Stirred in fresh basil, parsley and ricotta when I pulled from the oven. My husband insisted not mixing linguine in/together and served like spaghetti but I would absolutely mix altogether next time. Served with French bread. This was DELICIOUS!! Flavorful and pretty dang easy. Sprinkled Romano overall. A new favorite and easy weeknight or Meatless Monday/Lent alternative!  Must make again!!
