                "reviewBody": "These are very good but I had to make a few changes.  First of all,  I could only find a 16 oz box of angel food cake mix made by Betty Crocker and while the box amount is less than the recipe requires,  the mix made 29 cupcakes....not 12!  One of the reviewers had suggested to fill the cupcake holders all the way full so make a bigger cupcake.  I don't recommend this.  I did it with my first batch and it was too much cake mix.  The tops of the cupcakes ballooned out and ran into each other.  I had to use a knife to seperate them from each other and then had to chisel the cupcakes off the muffin pan to get them out.  The rest I filled at 3/4 full and they turned out perfect.  Bigger than the 2/3 suggested in the recipe but smaller than filling them all the way and I had no problem getting them out of the muffin pan.  I do agree with the same reviewer on having the oven set at 350 degrees instead of 375 and I found I didn't have to add an extra 5 minutes.  I do know that oven temps can vary from oven to oven.  On my oven,  15 minutes was perfect.  So in summary, this is what I did.....  Used a 16 oz box cake mix which made way more cupcakes than the recipe says it will. (Plus if I had filled all of the cupcake paper wrappers 3/4 of the way full I would have gotten even more!) Fill them 3/4 of the way full and bake at 350\u00b0 for 15 minutes.  Makes 2 to 3 dozen.",

Give the mix some time to settle before putting it into the baking cups (otherwise you will get some with too much air and they come out looking like a deflated souffle They also tend to be rather delecate comming out of the pan.\n\nServing Suggestion: I put whipped cream and sliced strawberrys ontop. Everyone loved them. ",

For starters this recipe was very vague. The box says to beat together the mix with 1 1/4 cups COLD water. I filled the cups 3/4 full and they came out fine. My first batch was a lot smaller because i didnt want the cupcakes to overflow. The box also says to keep the batter refridgerated between baking. I baked for about 14 minutes until the tops were golden. It made about 30 good sized cup cakes for me. I frosted with coolwhip. A lot of variations can be made with this recipe - Use could add mandarin orange segments and substitute half the water for the liguid in the can. You could add many extracts and food coloring to create a tie-dye effect.",
