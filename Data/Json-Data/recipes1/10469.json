Our recipe has 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp salt. And it calls for a 16 oz can of chocolate syrup. Which measure out to be 1 1/2 cups of syrup not 2 cups like you would think 16oz would be. And we bake it in a 9 X 13 pan for 25 mins until it comes out clean on a toothpick. Hope you try it with my suggestions this recipe is cakey but good!",
