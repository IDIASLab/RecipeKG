Because it was a very hot day and I wanted to limit the heat from the oven, I made it in four small loaves and a few muffins.  This cut back the baking time by about 15 minutes.   The texture of the bread is wonderful and the addition of dates adds a nice sweetness to the bread.    This is a great use of the zucchini from your garden.    I highly recommend this recipe.",
