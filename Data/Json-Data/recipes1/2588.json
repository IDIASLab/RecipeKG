Try coconut creme pudding (Jell-O makes it) and pineapple supreme cake mix (I think by Duncan Hines) instead of the vanilla pudding and yellow cake mix. Also for cupcakes you can use just 1 box of pudding and half the milk. Whipped cream stays firmer if you freeze the bowl you mix it in first. Try not to eat them all by yourself!",

Due to nut allergies and personal taste preference with some guests I topped only some pieces with the coconut and nuts. This tasted good but much better the next day.
