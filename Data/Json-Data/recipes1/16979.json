Here's how I followed the recipe to a \"T\" - subbed my fave Golden Sweet Cornbread from this site (I use GF flour), skipped the papers and sprayed the tin, used leftover pulled pork tenderloin. I didn't taste the cheese much, but my homemade BBQ sauce is pretty spicy and I'm guessing that hid the bite from the cheese. Really, an amazing finger food that I can't wait to serve for a game day sandwich alternative. Thanks for another winner, Chef John!",

I made six using pulled pork and six using BBQ chicken (because we had some Jewish friends at the party).  To make the BBQ chicken I just shredded a pre cooked Johnsonville Southwest chicken breast and added some bottled BBQ sauce.  I used two different patterned muffin tin liners to easily differentiate between the two meats.  The only change I would make next time is in the directions.  The directions tell you to initially fill the tins half way.  I did not have enough batter to do that and cover the filling.  I recommend just putting in enough batter to cover the bottom of the tin before putting on the BBQ meat and then judiciously cover each filling.",
