At the advice of the other reviews did less sugar and also added a pinch of smoked paprika. Turned out great the whole family loved them. Just a little hint is that I wasn't sure they were done cuz they were still sticky/gooey but after giving them a little extra time just decided to pull them out and when they cooled the coating dried up nicely. So may appear to still be sticky/gooey after the hour but when cooled will be fine.",
