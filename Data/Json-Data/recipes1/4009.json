It adds an exceptional flavor and a touch of sweetness to the soup.  The original recipe says to use the florettes....nonsence...chop the stems and leaves and throw them in.  It says to simmer 10 minutes, NOPE.  It takes at least 20 minutes for the broccoli to become soft.  DON'T use a hand mixer to smash the broccoli.  Use a potato masher and don't go nuts mashing it.  Larger pieces of broccoli really make this soup exceptional.  If you use a blender or mixer, you'll have a bowl of druel.  Try this...fry up a few pieces of bacon and crumble it in the soup.  It adds another dimension to this recipe.  Everyone loves this soup, including kids.  PS...Use Oberweis SKIM MILK.  You can't tell the difference from whole milk and you can save a bunch of calories.  ",

I also did not puree the broccoli.  I like a chunky soup.  For the roux I melted the butter and removed from heat.  Then I measured the 3 Tbs. flour in a small bowl and added a little bit at a time of the milk/cream mixture and whisked it till smooth.  Then I added it to the melted butter.  Then added that to the soup.  NO LUMPS!  Served with Grated Cheddar Cheese and Warm French Bread.  So good on a Hurricane Wilma night.",

Rather than puree, I followed another member's suggestion and just let the broth and broccoli boil down, but after 10 minutes, I took some of the broccoli out, so we could have some big pieces of it in the soup.  I doubled the broth, because it does boil off quite a bit.  What a keeper- this is my new broccoli soup, thanks!! (But just know that it doesn't smell so great while it's cooking, but it will taste good)",

My changes: 1/2 lg red onion, 2 stalks celery, a few handfuls of baby carrots (chopped), 4c. Unchicken Broth, 2c. Low Sodium Vegetable Broth, 2.5 lbs of broccoli florets, 3 c. Rice Milk, 1 c. Fat Free Half and Half, 1 sprig fresh marjoram, 1/8 -1/4 of a block of fat free cream cheese (gave it more body) and a bit of light Velvetta.  For the roux I used a butter, EVOO blend w/spelt flour, sea salt and white pepper. \n\nI found a huge bag of broccoli florets @ Sam's Club/Costco so that really helped things along.  I prefer a chunkier soup so I just used my hand blender and blended half of the soup or so.  The broccoli was really tender when all was said and done anyway.  It was really very, very good.",

Followed it to a T and it was more of an overly gritty texture of broccoli then a creamy soup. And bland. No umph of flavor. As much salt and pepper as I had to use, it still was not very flavorful as other cream of broccoli soups that I've had. So sorry, it needs something.",
