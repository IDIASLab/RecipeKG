I agree with SWEETWHEAT except I rate this recipe lower because the texture and consistency are absolutely nothing like a cheesecake ought to be. What you end up with is essentially a fudge pie which although rich and chocolaty will disappoint anyone expecting a dish with the texture of actual cheesecake. Even though this is an incredibly simple recipe I won't make it again because the final product did not live up to my expectations. It's not creamy or light at all. It's dense too thick and very heavy. UPDATE: Well \"zestytomato \" I am one of the persons who knows that a cheesecake is NOT supposed to have the consistency of fudge which is exactly how this recipe turns out like a block of fudge in a crust. Cheesecake is if made properly light. There is a big difference between dense and heavy (as this fake \"cheesecake\" is) and rich and light (which conventional cheesecake most definitely is).",

In response to another reviewer's problem with too much batter when filling the pie crust I think the problem was that too small of a crust was used. The majority of the graham cracker crusts in the grocery stores are 8-in. If you look a little further there are some 9-in ones to be found. The batter fit just perfectly in the 9-in crust. Thanks Kristie for a recipe I will use again and again.",
