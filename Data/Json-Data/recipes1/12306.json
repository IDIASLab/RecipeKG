Some people criticize it for not being perfect restaurant quality, but c'mon, all we want is a very easy and quick recipe and this fits the bill.  And it tastes great.  HOWEVER, follow many of the other reviews and increase the spices, or it will be bland.  I doubled the garlic, doubled the ginger (used ginger powder), and added 2t garlic powder (easier than minced garlic).  Also added 1/4 t of red pepper flakes (1/2 t for some heat)and reduced sugar(used brown sugar) by about a third.  Also doubled the amount of beef stock which still made a nice thick sauce -- otherwise it is thick mud if you use the recommended amount of stock.  Cook the meat quickly and remove and add again when sauce begins to thicken so meat doesn't overcook.  These really are the recommendations of other reviewers but I thought I'd save you the time of looking at all the reviews.  I'll definitely make this again.",

The first change that I made was to cook the round steak until tender before adding vegetables.  I also added one sliced onion to the simmering the meat. I also doubled the marinade and the sauce based on previous comments and also because I think I had more meat than the recipe called for.  I added chile oil, chili garlic sauce and substituted one teaspoon of sesame oil for oyster sauce.  My brocolli beef stood up to the best Chinese restaurants.  My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  It's easy to prepare and a must try.  I don't think you can really go wrong because you can add anything you like and it would probably still be good.  It has an excellent foundation to work with.",

This recipe was everything I was looking for - quick easy very yummy and healthy. After reading the reviews I used 14 oz of broth ground ginger sirloin and threw chopped onion in with the beef. I also used frozen broccoli because I'm lazy. =) The sauce was perfect and was terrific over rice. I think this recipe could be easily adapted to accomodate whatever ingredients you have on hand - and I think it might freeze well (I'm going to make extra next time and try freezing the leftovers to see how it goes). Thanks so much - this one's going to be committed to my memory!",

I also separate some out for the kids and then add red pepper flakes to the remainder for my husband and I and our spicy palates! Very yummy!",

Though I would have to say that after it cooks the chunks of ginger are a bit too much so instead I would use powdered ginger root or used bigger piecies of ginger and just remove it after its cooked.
