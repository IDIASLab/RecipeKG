A dear neighbor used to bake these for our family every year at Christmas.  I had the recipe but misplaced it when we moved away.  Only last week, we were in a delightful Mennonite bakery and saw these cookies labeled Buttermilk cookies.  My children were so excited.  I got right online and found the recipe here.  Dana, thanks for posting this wonderful recipe.  These cookies are cake like in texture and simple in flavor.  When used with cookie cutters they puff up wonderfully and are easy for children to decorate.  We have often added peppermint or lemon to the icing.",

Instead of buttermilk I used 1/2 souf cream 1/2 milk and lemon juice(1tbs lemon to 1 cup of milk.) The kids in my neighborhood loved them! Makes enough to shere with everyone!

Keeping in mind that half of my shortening needed for the cookie recipe was already cut into most of my dry ingredients it all turned out pretty good. Will have to make it again correctly to see how much better they are. Mine had a texture similar to corn bread and I tried to make bar cookies out of them in my jelly roll pan. It wasn't my night for baking because I got too much batter in the pan so it was more like a thick jelly roll or a thin cake. grin Ended up being the perfect size for tot snacks. Would be really tasty with chocolate frosting!! It received top ratings from DH a 20-month old and a 7 month old! (As well as the 'chef' in question). Hope you enjoy them as much as we did!",
