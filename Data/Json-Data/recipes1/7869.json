With mine, you leave out the celery, use red instead of green bell pepper, and 2 or 3 chopped green onions instead of minced onion plus a tsp. or so of season salt. One way to make it thicker is to grind an additional cup of pecans (I use my blender) and stir that into the cheese ball before shaping. ",

I could not form it into a ball until i stuck it in the refigerator for 4 hours. It never really set up they way it should have so i put it on a platter and formed it into a rectangle. I then covered it with the pecans. I'm anxious to make this again. I will drain the pineapple with a strainer:) For sure a keeper even if it never sets up right for me. The taste is wonderful:)",
