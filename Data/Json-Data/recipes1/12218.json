You need all the crust to soak up the eggs and milk.  I simply rip the loaf into bite size pieces with my hands, much easier than cubing it.  Secondly, toss the bread, 1.5 cups ham cubes and 2-3 cups shredded cheese with 2-3 Tablespoons of flour before putting it all in the baking dish, it keeps the egg bake from being soggy.  Then, blend the eggs/milk in the blender with the other ingredients (I add 3 Tablespoons margerine and 1 tsp. dry mustard) and pour over the bread mixture.  Cover and let it sit overnight in the fridge allowing the bread time to absorb the liquid.  It will look almost too dry the next morning, but it's supposed to.  I bake it at 350 for about an hour, uncovering it at about forty minutes.  I do not put it in a water bath.  Enjoy!",

I use regular bread and I do layer it - both \"details\" that I would leave the same as the recipe. Sometimes we substitute crispy bacon for ham. Oh - and we leave the bread in whole slices (minus the crust) and butter it. I suppose that is why we don't have to use the water pan. Another thing we add is some crushed Special K or corn flakes to the top just before baking with some melted butter sprinkled on top to prevent them from drying out. Adds some crisp. BUT...this omelet is GREAT just as it is written. We call ours the Christmas Morning Lifesaver! Great for company and if we need two we do one ham and one bacon.",
