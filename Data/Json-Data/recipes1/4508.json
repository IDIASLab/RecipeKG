Here are my adjustments: butter instead of oil no garlic no sugar (didn't even see it in the recipe until later thank goodness) used 2 c. chicken broth and 2 c. milk a couple of handfuls of cooked fine egg noodles. For meat I used a large breast which I poached while making the soup. I also added a couple of handfuls of frozen sweet corn and peas. Sounds like a lot of adjustments but it was really just common sense. Thanks Holly for the jumping off point.",
