Though I freeze a great deal of it to use through the Winter this is exactly the type of recipe I was looking for something to use butternut for that is unique pretty and delicious. I made it in my bread machine to dough stage then took it out let it rest 15 minutes after punching down. Mine had a tone of air bubbles in it but I soon discovered that is what made this the lightest most tender danish style dough I have ever eaten. Roll it out to a roughly 16x12 inch rectangle dont try and work out all the bubbles. Spread with 1/2 stick softened butter. Mix 1/2 c brown sugar 1/3 c raisins 1/3 c finely chopped nuts 1/8 c. orange juice. Spread this mixture over buttered dough roll up fairly tight twist and shape into circle on cookie sheet. Bake at 350 till med golden brown. I also replaced the 2 Tbsp of water in the recipe with 2 Tbsp orange juice. Unbelievable thank you for submitting this recipe.",

                "reviewBody": "I made this bread as one loaf and a roll (so I could taste it earlier!) with several modifications. Instead of the squash I used canned pumpkin (had some that needed using). I also used 1/2 white whole wheat flour and 1/2 stone ground whole wheat flour. The last modification I made was to use honey and molasses in place of the brown sugar. This bread turned out beautifully. Using the pumpkin gave it a rich color (more than I think you'd get with the squash) and the flavor is subtle but fantastic. The bread even though it is with 100% whole wheat is delicate soft and light. Next time I make it I may add a little more molasses and maybe a pinch of nutmeg. I will certainly make this bread again- as a braid or as rolls- both worked out great. Thanks for a great recipe.",

For those who said it was 'tasteless' perhaps you don't realize that squash (I used Butternut Squash) has a very delicate taste. It is not bold nor is this bread. The butternut flavor came through without question. This is not a sweet bread (as in dessert) so don't let the little bit of Brown Sugar scare you. It's a fantastic treat for the palate and is hearty enough to go great with dinner.",

The very yellow colour and too soft crust are what I didn't care for. I would liken the texture to that of a croissant. The dough was very easy to work with and the actual bread texture was quite good. I baked it in a round shape and served it with pats of both sage and whipped butter. I'll save most of it to hopefully make a good toast. I may look around to improve this bread or opt for another recipe. Thanks anyway.",
