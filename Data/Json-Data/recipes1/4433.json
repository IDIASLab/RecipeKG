I added 1 garlic clove and 1 more medium-sized potato.  I used very little cream but the soup doesn't need it.  I may leave the cream as a garnish next time to be served at the table.

There must have been an omission of the garlic so I added four cloves.  I used homemade chicken stock without the bouillon cubes.  We don't cook with salt and that is all they tend to add to your cooking.  Added the tips after the 20 min boil along with four large chopped mushrooms.  In each bowl we added another teaspoon of butter and served it with homemade marjoram bread.  The perfect easy dinner.  Great blend of celery, garlic, onion, and asparagus.  It also helped to use organic asparagus that was the best we had ever tasted.  On the table was pepper and sea salt for those that needed more of either.",

Also, the measurement for the bouillon couldn't be right.  That would be the equivalent of 12 cubes.  (Perhaps they meant 4 tsp.) I used 2 cubes and 2 packets of low-sodium bouillon, along with a 14 oz. can of broth.  Came out perfect.  I didn't puree all of the soup so there would be some chunks.  Will make the next time and add chicken and mushrooms.",

I used 3 poptatoes and added 4 small-medium carrots.  When chopping the asparagas, I left the tips off to the side for later.  In the stock, I boiled the potatoes, carrots, and asparagas stalks.  While that was boiling I sauted the onion and celery (and the added garlic).  \n\nWhen all of that was ready, I pulled about 2/3 of the potatoe/carrotasparagas mixture and about 2/3 of the onion/celery/garlic mixture with a slotted spoon to be pureed (along with some of the broth for a liquid).\n\nAfter removin everything that will be pureed, I then added the asparagas tips into the boiling stck.  With the remainder of the onion/celery/garlic mix, I then added the flour, which was then added to the stock.  I then added the pureed mixture back to the pot and brought the mixture back to a boil on simmer.  I added 8 oz. of heavy cream, but I can see where that would be optional.\n\nWhen served, I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese.\n\nThis was a huge hit.  My husband and I were fighting over who got to take the one serving of left overs with them to work for lunch the next day. Having it partially pureed but leaving some pieces to bite into was great.  I will definitely be doing this again the exact same way I did this time.\n\nNote: soy sauce was NOT used, and I think that was the right choice.",
