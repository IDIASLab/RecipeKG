I basically halved all the other ingredients, left out zucchini in the stuffing mix, used dried basil (1/2 tsp, plus a 1/2 tsp dried oregano), and left the garlic at the full 3 cloves. We couldn't find just one link of chicken sausage, so we used regular Italian sausage. Oh boy was this tasty! One last tweak, I didn't want to try and use just a part of a can of tomatoes, so I used 1 large Roma tomato, finely diced and tossed it in with the onions to cook them down. Deglazing the pan with chicken broth is a taste booster as well. I can't wait to make this again!",

First I had Italian zucchini ( we call them hand gernades) so I hollowed them out and stuffed them with the filling. Before placing them in the oven I brushed the outsides with olive oil. Next I didn't have chicken sausage so I poached a chicken breast with garlic and onion and shredded it. Then I added Italian seasoning to the mixture since the meat did not have the sausage seasoning. Finally I was low in parmesan cheese so I threw in some mazzarella. They were amazing! My husband doesn't typically like veggies and he loved it! I served it with pasta and tomato sause and garlic bread. I am actually going to be making this again tonight! Thanks for an awesome dish!",

But it was still good.\" There was something that tasted exceptionally rich about this dish that made my family and I feel guilty for eating it as an entire meal and not as a tiny-bite appetizer. It's not that it's unhealthy in the slightest but it was just very well rich. There was also way too much stuffing mixture called for to fill 2 zucchini halves so I just mashed up what was left and baked \"balls\" alongside the zucchini. I didn't change anything about the recipe except to bake it longer at a lower temp. I think if I made this again I'd sub ground beef for the sausage and cheddar for the parm otherwise the directions prep and end result was pretty tasty.",
