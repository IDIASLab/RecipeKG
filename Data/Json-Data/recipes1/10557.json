Remove the eggs from heat when they are about room temp to the touch and constantly whisk remove from heat and whip the eggs on medium speed for about 4 minutes; also the cake should still be \"jiggly\" in the center when you take it from the oven. The recipe I use requires the cake to be frozen for 12 hours after cooled from the oven and about 15 minutes prior to serving set out on counter. Spread thin layer whipped topping on sides and top(home made - 1 C heavy whipping cream 1 T conf. sugar and 1/2 t. vanilla) - load with chocolate curls in the center and pipe some whip cream using a star tip around the curls. Raspberry sauce is excellent on the plate. It is 12 servings because it is so increadibly rich. This is the best truly chocoholic recipe I have ever made! Thanks so much for sharing it. You must try this!",
