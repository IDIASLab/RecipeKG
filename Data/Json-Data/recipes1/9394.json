You should definitely add a LOT of seasoning to give it some extra flavor as spinach and matzo both are very un-flavorful.  I also added a lot of mozzarella cheese after it was out of the pan... I love it! And it is sooo healthy.  Just add what you think would taste good! It would be hard to mess up!!! ",
