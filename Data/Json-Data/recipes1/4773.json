All of the ingredients are the same, but some of the quantities are different:  2 whole chicken breasts instead of 5, 8 oz of tomatoes instead of 14.5, 1 cup of salsa instead of 1/2 cup, 2 tsp of cornstarch instead of 2 tbsp, and a mixture of black and green olives instead of 2 cups of black.  I used a medium-heat salsa, and whole tomatoes that I crushed before adding.  I wonder if maybe it was these small differences that kept mine from being \"bland,\" as some people are complaining?  Anyway, the fella liked it - the pineapple bits were particularly spicy and tangy and delicious - so next time I'll make it the Allrecipes way and update.",
