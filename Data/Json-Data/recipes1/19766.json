I didn't have salsa so I used a can of Rotel (liquid drained) and a can of green chilies instead. The aroma while it was baking was wonderful and I can't help thinking this would be an interesting alternative to cornbread. Will definitely make again. Update: made again but used muffin tins instead of the large baking dish and it was even better! It gave the bread more of a cheese crust. Anyways I continue to use the Rotel/green chilies instead of the salsa. I like the flavor better.",

I used my own homemade salsa and a cup and a half of pepper-jack cheese. I think using homemade salsa and a peppier cheese helped this recipe quite a bit. I think this would be even better if I had stirred in a little homemade taco seasoning into the salsa before I spread it on the dough pieces. GREAT cheap and quick \"side\" on a very low-cook feelin' kind of day plus I always coupon whomp biscuits for next to nothing so this was a new way to use them. This would make a fun white trash party app!",

I think it needs something a little more flavorful--the biscuit is good where it comes in contact with what is added but it sort of dry and boring without it. I used minced garlic instead of onions--we're not huge onion fans and the salsa I used had onions anyway. I prefer it that way. Very good with our chicken and green bean dinner a few nights ago. thanks for the recipe!",
