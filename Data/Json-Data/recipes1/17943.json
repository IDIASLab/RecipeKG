I doubled the batch and it made more than 24 and I also ground up the hazelnuts since I don't love taking a big bite of a cupcake and getting a huge piece of nut. I added a little but more Nutella to the frosting and the frosting is truly creamy...the best buttercream I've ever made. A very good recipe! It's the perfect combo...the cupcake tastes like a brownie and the frosting balances out the heaviness of the brownie!",
