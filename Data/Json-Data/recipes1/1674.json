The dough was tough to work with, it should rise for an hour first.  When putting the pretzels in the baking soda water, I had one completely fall apart.  I'm not sure I agree with the 475 degree temperature either.  I had mine in for 9minutes, and they burned.  They tasted okay, just more trouble to make than the Mall Pretzels.

After the dough was mixed I hand kneaded several times and placed the dough in a greased bowl and let it rise for one hour. I then punched it down and kneaded it a couple of more times and cut the dough into sixteen pieces. Once my pretzels were formed I let them rest for about ten minutes while I prepared my boiling water to which I added two tablespoons of baking soda. The pretzels held a perfect shape while poaching and were easily extracted with a slotted flipper. Once cooled I brushed the pretzels with an egg wash and proceeded with a garlic and salt topping. They came out golden and shiney. The gang devoured them! Thanks for a good start Colleen!",

After shaping I increased the rising time to at least a full hour.

I reduced baking to 7 min. or golden brushed with melted butter while cooling and sprinkled with either salt or cinnamon-sugar.",

Since the dough had risen they were very delicate and were easily misshapen in the transfer process to the pot of water. Then they came out looking really weird. They taste good though. And since they were boiled they stay moist for awhile. So if you can't eat them all right away they keep pretty well in a Ziploc bag. I think I'll try some other recipes though.",
