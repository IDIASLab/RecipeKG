It was pouring rain so I didn't bother cutting fresh herbs. I used dried sage dried thyme and a dash of herbes de provence and halved the quantity (dried vs. fresh). This is hands down one of the best sausages I've ever made. Not just the best turkey sausage the best of ANY kind! Thanks for the great recipe!",
