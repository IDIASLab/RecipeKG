                "reviewBody": "I made these twice this past Easter weekend, the first time following the recipe exactly. The second time I watched the video & read all the reviews then made my own adjustments and would highly recommend the following changes: 1/2 Tbsp baking powder, 1/2 c sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp almond extract and specifically sweetened coconut flakes and a variety of eggs (I used Lindt chocolate covered almonds and Robin eggs). The reduction in baking powder is due to cookies rising too much initially & not keeping the dip to hold the eggs. The recipe doesn't specify unsweetened or sweetened coconut flakes so I used sweetened and reduced the sugar because they were very sweet the first time! (For my taste anyway, but were still very much liked!) And finally the extracts were to give it a little more flavor, the almond addition went very well and also softened the cookies. The video is much more informative, don't forget to cool the batter before rolling in the coconut flakes to prevent spreading. Also baking at 325 for 14-15 minutes then allowing to cool was easier than the other way. The second time after the adjustments I enjoyed them much more, hope this helps!",
