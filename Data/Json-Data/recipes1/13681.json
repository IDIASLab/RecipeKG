I read some of the reviews and I think some people are not making this quite right. First I took the idea from the recipe to make it in a 9/13 inch pan. The refridgerator crescent rolls fit perfectly into the bottom of the pan. I cut the brie into little pieces and sprinkled it over the crust. Then I stirred up the cranberry sauce and dropped it in little dollops. I only used the 3/4 of a cup that was called for which is about 1/2 the can. Then topped with the pecans. It seems like other people smeared the jam all across it as you would pizza sauce. This really isn't like a pizza. It's little bar like appetizers. They are wonderful. Don't overdo the toppings. It was the first thing to be completely eaten at the shower. I will definitely be making it again. The picture posted is nothing like what I made. It looks like they used pizza crust. Mine was visually appealing and tasty. I think the people who complained about it running overloaded the pizza with too much jam. I just wanted to update this by saying I've made this for so many events over the years and always get requests for it. It is always the first thing to be eaten. Sometimes men need convincing to try it but once they have you can't keep them away. Thanks for an excellent easy recipe that I've used over and over.",

I think next time I will make the effort to get the whole variety or try raspberry preserves instead. The sauce didn't melt and looked clumpy. I would also add more pecans. My husband liked this more than me and has had three pieces tonight. The tart taste of the cranberry sauce cut through the thick creaminess of the brie quite nicely.",

I used a 10\" springform pan which worked perfectly to open up and slide the pizza onto a cutting board. Spiced up the cranberry sauce with a little cayenne and balsamic vinegar reduction (a splash of the vinegar would work fine). Try to get the softest (smushiest in the center) brie you can find don't cut off the crust and don't overload with ingredients to keep it crisp. A yummy easy appetizer.",
