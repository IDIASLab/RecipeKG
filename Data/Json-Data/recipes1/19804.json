It is perfect for last minute guests or a weeknight dessert when you are craving something sweet but don't want to go to overboard on the calories.  I used light lemon yogurt & light cool-whip.  I am sure it would be even more wonderful with a homeade angel food cake, but, the ease of using a good store bought cake is what makes this such a simple dessert to make.  The \"icing\" is light and fluffy and reminds me of a fruit dip. It would be very easy to switch the flavor of the icing using different flavors of yogurt.  I think next time instead of icing I would just top the sliced cake with the fluff and some fresh fruit. Thanks, Perri!",
