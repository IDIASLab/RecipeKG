Instead of white sugar I use 1c brown, 1c confectioner's and 1c white with 3c peanut butter and 3 eggs. I like that the brown sugar gives them a little chewiness and the confectioner's cuts the white sugar so you don't get any gritty texture at all in these. It also stiffens the dough so they don't spread. You can do them with more confectioner's sugar if you like a really solid cookie. I also use a small scoop to form these and just put the flat side down on the cookies sheet-no rolling and rolling! Enjoy!",

Somehow ours made a lot more than the recipe said ~ we ended up with 21 big ones & 21 bite sized ones. For the little ones, we put a chocolate chip in the middle instead of a kiss. They are the perfect size for my 2 year old! The kids enjoyed measuring, mixing and rolling these into balls. We rolled them in sugar for added calories (well, mostly for appearance). One slight change I made was to take the pan out 2 minutes early, put the chocolate on and then finish baking. Very kid friendly & yummy recipe! Very, very little clean-up which is a HUGE plus!",

You really should unwrap the kisses ahead of time & keep them in freezer while the cookie bakes to eliminate them melting and looking yucky.  I also put the entire tray of cookies in the fridge for a bit after I've put the hershey kiss on top to help them set.  UPDATE: Okay, life gets busy!!!  I am all about making everything from scratch (heck, we make our own bread in this house), but with a zoo-filled household, sometimes I like to cheat.  Betty Crocker has little packages next to their cake mixes for peanut butter cookies (comes in red plastic).  You just add water, mix, and bake.  Well, they turn out identical AND hold together WAY BETTER the days after (you just have to add the kiss in the middle). A lot quicker if you want to double the recipe too.  Makes a bunch, and they can be stored at room temp whereas sometimes these don't always have thee same consistency several days after.  Just an idea for those in a rush!!!",
