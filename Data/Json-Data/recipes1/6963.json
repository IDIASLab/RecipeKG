No fuss no marinating. I wasn't fond of the wine taste this recipe gave the meat and the garlic stuffed in it had an odd texture I didn't like. FWIW I used a 2-lb roast used the called-for amounts of spice but halved the amount of wine and marinated for about 24 hours. On the upside this did prompt me to get out my old dutch oven and re-season it. I'll be using it now for all my roasts!",
