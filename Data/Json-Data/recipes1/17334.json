I've actually added into my banana bread recipe and it's sooooooooooooo good!! My husband raves about it. Have to try this! Use it in whatever sounds good to you. Milk, oatmeal, banana bread, on rice cakes, or even on toasted bread. Get creative. You may also add in some sugar depending on your taste. Enjoy!",

Then I mix the two together and sweeten the mix with raw organic honey and roll into balls for a delicious dessert. (I understood that honey is the preferred sweetener for this traditional and therapeutic Chinese recipe rather than white sugar and I think it improves the taste and nutrition). Delicious recipe--thank you so much for sharing!",
