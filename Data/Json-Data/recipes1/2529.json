It's not bad but if you wanted more of a rye bread taste maybe add some caraway. The gluten is definitely important as rye doesn't contain gluten and WW flour doesn't contain much so your bread won't rise properly without it. To make by hand I let it rise twice brushed the top with mustard and a little oil and baked it on a stone at 350 for about 35-40 minutes.",

I'm not even upset that I have to make another loaf of bread for bf since I doubt he's going to love the mustard in this. I adore my breadmaker but rarely bake a loaf of bread in it--I normally just use it to make the dough then finish it off in the oven. That's what I did today. I decided to make a regular bread loaf by using my bread pan. Worked out great. The dough smells heavenly before even going into the oven and it smells great while baking. I baked at 375 for about 45 minutes and it was perfect. Very soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. And it rose wonderfully well--let me add my voice to the others saying the wheat gluten really is important. Add it if you make this bread! Thanks for the recipe!",

The plentiful seeds added a very nice texture. The bread is tangy and rich tasting. It did take quite a while for rising to happen but eventually I had a doubled loaf. I did cook on a pan in a very hot oven reduced immediately with water added to produce steam. Result was a chewy crust and tender middle. My approach: Heat oven to 500 (or as high as you can). 15 minutes before baking uncover bread (mine was circular) slash with knife three parallel gashes about 1/4 inch deep. Pour about 1 cup boiling water into a pan set in bottom of oven (I use disposable pie tins). Place bread on baking sheet in oven and immediately reduce heat to 425. Bake 25 minutes turn loaf sheet (after all who's oven cooks evenly!?) and bake for about 20 more minutes or until dark golden brown and has a nice holow sounding thump when you whack it with your knuckes (or for the more precise until it registers about 195 degrees on a thermometer. By the way - I made this bread to pair with a lovely salty country ham we received (cooked!) as an early Christmas gift. This combo is delicious - with mayo and tomatoes out of this world!",
