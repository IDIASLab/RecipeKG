It definately makes a difference for the better in terms of taste and texture. I did not include chicken in mine so I used one can of chicken broth in place of the stock and I sauted the onion and celery in a bit of butter before addint to the mixture. I will definately be using this recipe for dressing from now on.",

A tip for those like me who need \"paint by number\" instructions... where the recipe says \"soak\" and doesn't say how much, I used 2.5 Cups.  And, one recipe (one pie tin) of cornbread was about 5 cups. Also, there are so many different types of \"biscuits\" from buttered to buttermilk... I used  a store brand (HEB) frozen pack labeled \"Biscuits Southern Style\" rather than the pack labeled buttery or buttermilk. Not sure how much difference that made. Yummy recipe!",

I used more sage than called for and added hot chili powder. I also used some homemade chicken stock and a bit of water to moisten the cornbread. Added some frozen veggie mix too.
