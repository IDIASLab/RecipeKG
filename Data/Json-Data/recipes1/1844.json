I've learned though, that it is better to pour the glaze into the poked holes after the cake has almost cooled completely, rather than while it's still warm to prevent it from breaking apart when slicing.  This is by-far the BEST cake that I've ever baked and I enjoy eating it everytime!!  Thanks Shawn!",
