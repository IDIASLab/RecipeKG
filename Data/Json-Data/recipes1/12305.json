I cut the recipe down and used butter and currants instead of golden raisins. While the butter might change the texture it shouldn't change it to more cake like which is what these cookies were. That isn't \"bad\" in itself as I know some folks prefer that type however the taste of these is just not to our liking. We could certainly taste the ketchup they were very very sweet and the nuts especially just didn't seem to go. Or rather the ketchup didn't go but since it's a vital ingredient to the recipe you can't omit it.:) It was fun to try and an interesting addition. Thank you!",

They didn't flatten out much so if I make them again (maybe maybe not) I'll flatten the balls of dough a little bit before baking. I omitted the nuts because of a nut allergy in a couple of my taste testers and substituted chocolate chips instead of raisins so my kids would be willing to try them. Overall most tasters thought they were worthy of three out of five stars. The only ones who gave them less than three stars knew before tasting them that the recipe contained ketchup so I think there was a little bit of a psychological thing going on there. Thanks for the opportunity to try something unique! I'm glad I tried them:-)",
