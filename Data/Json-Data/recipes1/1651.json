However , I would not  recommend following  the directions  by beating all the ingredients together in a bowl for 5 minutes with an electric mixer.  Excessive  mixing will cause the overdevelopment of gluten and make the bread tough instead of tender..  INSTEAD\u2026  Pour the dry ingredients into the wet ones (Only when each bowl of ingredients is mixed thoroughly )  and fold them together gently until just combined. Do this part by hand rather than with a mixer. The end result will be a nice sweet, tender quick bread. THX",
