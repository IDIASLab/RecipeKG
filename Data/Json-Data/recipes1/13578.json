If you want to make the pudding more custard-like I would recommend you use one can evaporated/condensed unsweetened milk instead of heavy cream. That will also cut down on a lot of fat! Also I would only add 1 or 1/2 cups of sugar because it would be way to sugary. Try using sweetened corn instead - like Green Giant Niblets. Adding a bit of vanilla will spice it up as well. Enjoy!",

I used evaporated milk for 1/2 of the heavy cream amount and heavy cream for the rest. I also added vanilla (1 t) as per my mom's recipe and added more sugar (3/4 c) also as per mom's recipe. I left off the salt because I felt the salted butter would be enough (it was for us). I used 1 can of creamed corn and the rest frozen fresh corn (maybe a little extra fresh frozen corn) and it turned out great!",

Here's what I did: I didn't have whole kernel corn so I used creamed corn. I don't use granulated sugar at all and subbed crystallized fructose but upped it to 3/4 c. Since I used creamed corn I upped the eggs too. I probably have something totally different than the original recipe! But even so what came out of the microwave was delicious and I used this recipe for a base. One thing I'll bet this recipe is pretty good as written even though I didn't make it that way. Thanks for sharing! BTW next time I try this recipe I'm going to sub sucralose (Splenda brand) for the sugar. The fructose didn't work so well for a custard. The pudding turned out well but there was a lot of watery sweet juice to it. I figure that's because the fructose once dissolved does not crystallize again.",
