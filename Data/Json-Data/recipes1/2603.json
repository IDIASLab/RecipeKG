I patted half of the crumb mixture on the bottom of a 13x9 pan used my hands to \"crumble\" on the cranberry sauce (no need to spread really) evenly and sprinkled on the rest of the oat mixture on top. I threw in some dried cranberries for texture with the jellied cranberry and topped the whole thing off with 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips. They were AWESOME! No eggs or milk so its great for restricted diets next I will try it with even less sugar.",

I read some of the reviews before making it but its been a while... anyway after it cooled off the butter reabsorbed but holy butter when I took it out of the oven! Good thing I don't need my cholesterol checked this week!.... seriously they are good but I would halve the butter and halve or 1/4 the sugar. You do not need that much! And thats why they only get 3 stars in my book. However I did like how the sugar carmelized. Kinda nice and I've never had a cobbler/cookie do that. I made as written although I toyed with making like cookies as others have. I used a 8x8 pan instead of 9x13 bc I like cobblers and cookies that way. I may make this again but definitely not with that amount of butter or sugar!",

It came out of the oven about an hour ago and I've already sneaked 2 little squares! They taste good! I did the same process as many split the crumbs to be half on the bottom half on top. I probably would even put just a little more on the bottom to give the squares a little more strength as you pick them up. I cut the butter down to a little more than half and that worked out fine. I also added some dried cranberries to the cranberry sauce and I'm glad I did. I wound up with a very thin layer of cranberry sauce when I spread it on but it turned out to be more than enough. I wouldn't consider increasing the amount of sauce. So far they taste GREAT warm but they need to cool some more before I officially cut them into squares. (edited to add: About half of them were stuck to the bottom of the pan so I only got about 8 small squares and the rest was more \"crumbly\". Would line iwth aluminum foil next time.)",
