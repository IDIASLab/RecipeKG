I then brushed egg white on a graham cracker pie crust and baked for 5 minutes until stiff. Pour pumpkin mixture into pie shell cover and chill.

Rarely do I find things that are 'too sweet' for me but even when I only used 1 cup of sugar in this recipe (as opposed to using the 2 cups that it called for) it was still overwhelmingly sweet (thank you previous reviewers for suggesting to cut the sugar). The only way for me to fix it was to add more pumpkin. I enjoyed the cardamom but also added cinnamon and nutmeg. After a few days in the fridge I then returned the mixture to a pan and on medium heat added chopped chicken breasts cilantro and curry. Served over basmati rice with some store bought garlic naan and made a great dinner out of it.",
