I doubled the vanilla (I do in every recipe), but didn't change anything else. For people worried about it being too spicy as written, don't fret. I can't handle spice at all, but had no problem with this frosting. Absolutely fantastic; a must try. Used this on the submitter's cupcake recipe, Cinco de Chili Chocolate Cupcakes with Chili Cream Cheese Frosting. Thanks!!! :)",

The flavor of this icing is fantastic and it really compliments the chili chocolate cupcakes perfectly, though I do believe that this icing would be fantastic on a variety of cakes. I did end up having to add more powdered sugar than called for just to get it to the right piping consistancy. I will definately be using this recipe over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)",
