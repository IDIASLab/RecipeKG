The cereal/oat flavor is not bashful at all, making this a distinctly \"cereal\"  flavored cookie.  The dough seemed a tad dry and crumbly as I dropped these onto the cookie sheet (with a medium cookie scoop, then flattened them slightly) but they turned out just fine - thick but not poofy, and perfectly, uniformly shaped.  Because I followed the recipe as written using shortening, I added a teaspoon of Lorann Butter Vanilla Emulsion in addition to the vanilla (found it at HomeGoods).  I don't know what difference that made, if any, but they sure tasted great!  I used quick-cooking oats and Special K cereal.  \"Almost\" like eating your breakfast cereal with your hands!  Yes, they might be just a teeny bit too sweet, but they're a cookie...and I can live with it.  :)",

I had no coconut so I subbed finely chopped hazelnuts subbed corn flakes for the whole wheat flakes and added 1/2 cup of raisins. I was too lazy to make individual cookies so I baked them in an oiled 9x13 baking dish for 25 minutes until they were brown around the edges. If you cut them right after you take them out of the oven they will be softer and easier to cut - I waited too long. (Cutting them with a baking scraper/chopper makes it easier than with a knife.)

I just made a batch and not only are they deliciously crispy chewy (just like a cookie should be in my opinion) with the oats and whole grain cereal they've got some healthy stuff going for them too. I substituted butter for shortening; I just like the taste better. And for the whole grain cereal I used Nature Path's Heritage Cereal. I'm definitely keeping this recipe and will make these again but next time I'll double the recipe because using a medium sized cookie scoop only yielded 21 cookies.
