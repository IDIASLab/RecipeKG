I will note however that for my taste the 1 1/2 teaspoons of almond extract is too much -- the almond flavor is so strong that it's like marzipan candy. I cut the amount in half and felt it was perfect, still noticeably an almond flavor but not overwhelming the other flavors. The full cup of chocolate chips will seem like overkill to many, but I'm a chocoholic so I was very pleased! It's also a lovely recipe made with dried cherries instead of chocolate chips.",

The Almond extract stands out amazingly and gives the dough an excellent taste. I only had 1/2 cup of chocolate chips so I added in a half cup of cinnamon chips aswell. I also didn't have hazelnuts so I used sliced Almonds instead. The results were incredible. One thing I would reccomend though is to lower down on the chips and nuts unless you like your scones jam-packed with toppings. Another thing the instructions don't mention is that its probably smart to flour the dough on the cookie sheet so that they are less sticky when you put them in to bake. Lastly I personally paint my scones with egg whites for color but I think that's more optional than necessary. As they are the directions are great and easy to follow; the scones are grade A I'll definitely be making these again.",
