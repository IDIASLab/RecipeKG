The sauce is AMAZING and so delicious, really to die for, and it *makes* the dish. The sauce is the perfect combination of sweet and salty, aromatic and delightful. I make this in huge batches and I add cherry tomatoes, blanched snap peas, baby carrots, and celery. We eat it as the main course, and we have yummy leftovers for the day after. I have made this recipe over and over again.",

I would only alter a few things:  add julienned carrots, sliced water chestnuts and pea pods cut in half on an angle- really adds nice color, texture and flavor.  Knock oil down to 1/3 cup otherwise it is REALLY oily.  I use fettucine noddles.  If you are making this ahead and chilling it (which I would recommend), add half of the dressing while noodles are still warm and will soak up flavor. MMM! Toss the other half of the dressing before serving.  I like it warm OR cold, but feel it is better cold.  Still great the next day.  Will make again and again!!",

You're in better luck when using chunks of chicken shredded makes the salad a little messy. You can eat this hot or cold its great! second review- this recipe gets better and better as you make it! I'm eating low carb so today I made this (still left the cilantro out) with low carb linguini (snapped them in half so they are short noodles) made the sauce with olive oil instead of vegetable oil used splenda instead of regular sugar and added vegetables to the green onion like some bok choy whole canned mushrooms sugar snap peas water chestnuts and julianned carrots. INCREDIBLE!! I love this stuff hot and cold. I usually bring a container to work and tend to eat it hot but by the time its lunch and I'm ready to do that its gone! great meal and great dish to bring to a party.",

I followed the advice of several people and used olive oil and only used half the amount. I wondered if it was going to be dry not using all the liquid but it wasn't in the least. In fact I think if you used all the oil the pasta would be swimming. I will be making this again and again. Thanks for the recipe Olivia!",
