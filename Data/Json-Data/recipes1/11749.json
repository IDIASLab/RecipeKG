                "reviewBody": "A good dish, but I altered it some, and was able to make it MUCH MORE QUICKLY.\n\nI used only 16 oz. sausage, and added the garlic and onion during the last few minutes of browning the meat to sautEe them all together.  I used a 28 oz. can of DICED tomatoes, undrained, and 1 full can of chicken broth.  Since these already have salt (and the sausage is flavorful enough), I didn't use ANY salt.  \n\nI don't know why people bothered to complain of it being too spicy.  Couldn't they see that 1 t. each of black and cayenne peppper was WAY TOO MUCH?!?  So adjust the spiciness accordingly.  (I only used a dash of black pepper.)\n\nThe biggest change was that I didn't cook it in the oven.  I just left everything in the large skillet once mixed.  I brought it to a boil, then reduced the heat, covered it, and cooked it for about 15 - 20 minutes, until the rice was done and most of the liquid was absorbed.  It was a lot quicker this way, and I didn't have to add any extra liquid as some others had to do when using the oven.\n\nWe had this as a main dish, and everyone in my family really liked it.  I will definitely make it again, with the changes mentioned here, of course.",

Also made the following changes: Used only 16 oz. ground sausage, used a can of Rotel (undrained), added a can of kidney beans, 1 carrot chopped, and 1 stick celery chopped.  Sauteed this all together then added the rice and broth.  Used almost 2 cups of broth.  Instead of cheyanne pepper, used a few dashes each of chili powder, ground red pepper, creole powder, black pepper, oregano and basil. Cooked it on low for about 30 minutes with the lid on.  Really good!",

This is definitely a keeper for me there are so many ways to adjust the heat level -- use mild or hot sausage a can of tomatoes or a can of extra hot Ro-Tel omit or keep the cayenne (plus many possibilities in between!)
