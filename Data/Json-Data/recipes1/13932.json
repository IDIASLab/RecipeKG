I covered bottom of pan in 1/16\" water, sealed tightly with foil and cooked ribs 2 hrs. at 300.  I then opened foil and drained all juices off.  I covered ribs in 18 oz of BBQ sauce and 1 tsp. dried onion flakes. I then replaced foil and cooked at 275 for another 40 minutes. I used 3.5 lbs very meaty country style ribs.  They were the most tender and moist ribs I'd ever made! They were falling off the bone and very moist still. I got the foil idea from another poster and also the bit of water as I did not want lemon.  I also mix about 3-4 different bottles sauces to come up with the one we like best.  We don't care for the one most posters mentioned.",

For those of you who\nmay not know the difference, \"country\nstyle ribs\" refers to the cut of meat not\nthe manner of preparation.  There are \nthree types of \"ribs\".  Spare ribs which\ncome from the belly, baby back which come\nfrom the loin, and country style which\nare no actually ribs and are cut from\nthe blade end of the loin.  Country \nstyle ribs have by far and away much more\nmeat and very little if any bone.  And it\nis precisely the extra marbling and meat\nthat allows them to cook so long.  If \nyou tried this and the meat was too dry,\nyou probably used the wrong cut.  If you\nare dead certain you used the proper cut,\nyou might try a simple light to moderate\nbrining solution for 12-24 hrs.  But I've\nnever had this method let me down.\nAnd don't reserve this for BBQ.  Use it\nwith any sauce you like... cranberry,\nmarinaded asian, etc...\nThe important ingredient in this method\nis the proper cut of meat.",

My local store had the country style pork ribs on sale, so I stocked up my freezer, and boy am I glad I did now that I have this great recipe!!!  My husband absolutely loved them as well!  Instead of just the ribs with BBQ sauce poured over them (which isn't a bad thing!), the tender meat had this subtle taste of garlic and lemon going all through it!  I used a large non-stick roasting pan, so that each rib wasn't touching.  I rubbed them generously with kosher salt and minced garlic (from the jar, gotta love convenience) all over.  I ended up using about 3 or 4 lemons, and layed lemon slices so that they covered the ribs completely.  Baked at 250 for about 2 and a 1/2 hours, then took the lemon OFF, poured Head Country BBQ sauce (the absolute BEST!) all over them, and baked for a little over an hour at 225 degrees.  I cannot express how delicious they were, and I am VERY much looking forward to the leftovers tonight!  This is now the only way I will prepare pork ribs!  Oh, and make sure and serve a little extra BBQ sauce warmed up on the side...especially if you LOVE it as much as I do!!!",

After 2 hours I drained the juice and covered the ribs with BBQ sauce. I turned the temp down to 275 and left the foil on for another 30 minutes. I then removed the foil for 20 minutes to let the sauce thicken. So a total of 2 hours and 50 minutes. \nThe ribs fell off the bone! I also used tenderizer, minced garlic, fresh lemon (which I squeezed over the ribs) and sliced onions.\nOh, I did not add water. If you use the right ribs and keep them covered, you should not have a problem with dry ribs. The amount of juice that I had to drain was more than plenty to make a gravy. ",

I KNOW, it sounds odd, but EVERY time I add a coke to meat, no matter what the cut, it turns out tender.  And for as cheap as these ribs were (got em' on sale) they turned out sooooooo good.  I put them on high in the crock pot (I have a 5 quart) at 2 p.m. and they were falling off of the bone by 6 p.m. (my crock pot cooks faster for an unknown reason).
