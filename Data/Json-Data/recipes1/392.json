What's best about it is, ...there aren't 100 reviews changing how to do it b/c it's good as is!  What's not mentioned is, the exact same recipe (taste, chewy, big) is on here, but in cookie form!!! How wonderful is that esp. if you love this recipe like my family and husbands soldiers we send this to do?!  You can find it under \"Best Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie\" ...the title is exactly how they always turn out.  I love this in brownie AND cookie form, so try both!!!  Also, I prefer the chocolate chips to be mixed IN instead of on top, but it's all about preference!  It would be overkill to add more than recommended though.  When I double the recipe, I still only put a heaping 2/3 C of cc, and it's MORE than enough.  TWICE I have won best chocolate chip cookie on our military base due to this recipe.",

If you like rich desserts as I do, make as is for an 8x8 pan or double the recipe for a 13x9. Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!",

I also used brownulated light brown sugar. Ya know, the one that pours ;). Oh, yeah, I cooked them in a 13x9 glass pan and did spray the pan lightly with cooking spray I also cooked them for slightly longer than the suggested time. My oven is brand new so I know the temperature is correct. They needed an extra 10 minutes or so. They came out excellent. Perfect.",
