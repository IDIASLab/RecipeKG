Actually, I will have to make them again today just to put a pic on this great recipe. I used Asiago cheese because that is what my local Costco had. I wrapped them in a half slice of Costco precooked bacon and baked as directed which makes it even easier. Watch them for burning though :)I also bought the big tub of pitted dates at Costco to make a bunch for the holidays.  Thanks for sharing this much appreciated and simple appetizer.",

I wound up cooking it for 22 minutes (another recipe recommends 30-40 min at 375 so I may try that). I also found that the bacon and cheese were not enough to cut the profound sweetness of the dates. So I'm guessing this is either a taste issue or a bacon issue or both. I may just need saltier bacon or stronger cheese.:-)",
