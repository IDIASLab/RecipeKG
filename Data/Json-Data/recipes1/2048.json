The only things I did differently were that I used 5 pints of large berries, I also brushed the bottom crust with a little beaten egg, squeezed a little lemon juice over the berries and dotted with butter before putting the top crust on. I brushed the top crust with some of the beaten egg and sprinkled sugar over it. It was delicious and I agree, serve this with a little vanilla ice-cream. I've made this pie about 5 times this summer and received rave reviews each time. One more tip ~ make sure that you combine the berries with the sugar and flour well until you no longer see any \"white\" coating on the berries.",

The recipe as stated tastes great.  However, I recommend brushing part of an egg on the bottom of the pie shell before adding the berries so that the bottom will not become soggy.  Instead of using all-purpose flour, I tried tapioca flour once.  It turned out a thicker and bit sweeter berry filling than the straight flour.  I liked it.  Another thing I did was to add a tablespoon or two of cold butter chopped up and sprinkled over the berries. If you like a buttery flavor, this is definitely the way to go.  All three times I used a butter pie crust.\r\n\r\nIf you have the option between frozen and fresh blackberries, I highly recommend the fresh.  I tried both.  The fresh were much tastier.\r\n\r\nWhen it came down to it... each variation tasted great and I highly recommend this recipe. It is resilient to modifications and very tasty.",

I followed the recipe exactly (but I used store bought frozen pie crusts) and it was absolutely delicious.  First fruit pie I ever made and it was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe that made me feel good about myself!  It's so cool to use ingredients from your yard to feed your family!  The crust was perfect thanks to the great temp/time directions!  Will use this every season!...Vanilla ice cream is the topper (literally)!",

I can't imagine why anyone would want 1/4 cup sugar on top of their pie and saturate it with 2 whole tablespoons of milk. One tablespoon milk is enough, and and 1-2 tsps of sugar is really all you need on top. The pie was runny with flour, so I replaced the flour with 1/4 cup of instant, granulated tapioca. Once it cooled completely, the pie didn't run at all. Squeeze half a lemon over the berries and sprinkle 2 tablespoons of chopped butter over them as well before topping off the pie with the second crust. Brushing the bottom with egg saves the pie from getting soggy on the bottom. Absolutely amazing on a hot summer day with French Vanilla ice cream!",

My pie was too stiff - so next time I will use less flour or substitute tapioca. Also I will add more sugar next time - maybe 3/4 cup instead of just 1/2. I may also take one of the other reviewer's advice and add a little lemon juice. Overall a good basic recipe you can work with.",
