I decided to use the vanilla creme cake and purchased Blue Bell vanilla ice cream (boy am I glad it was on sale so good!). I cut the pound cake into three layers. Layered with cake ice cream cake ice cream and last layer of cake. Froze to firm up the ice cream. Then I spread cool whip like icing all over cake and added decorations (was my daughter's birthday cake). EVERYONE not only loved it but were highly impressed that I'd made it! The cool whip hide the fact that it looked messy due to my imperfect technique (first time doing something like this). It came out so delicious and easy!! Next time I'll try the chocolate creme cake and rocky road ice cream. The possibilities are endless!",

Do prepare the day before and put on the freezer take it out when you serve dinner or about a an hour before you need to serve it. I ve made this three (3) times and friends keep asking me to make more! You can make a sauce to complement the ice cream you used if you want to be fancy and/or the occasion demands it (use chocolate syrup for kids!). Last time (for a friend s 40th) I used strawberry sauce (laced with wine) to soak the cake it was really nice. Thank you! I don t have to bake cakes anymore!!!!!",

As much as I love cooking that's how much I loathe baking which was one of the reasons this recipe caught my eye. I'm sure both of my Oma's are looking down in despair! Anyway like others I changed it up a bit. Instead of breaking up the cake I split it put the ice cream on the bottom layer topped it and glazed it with \"Tunisianswife's chocolate glaze on this site.
