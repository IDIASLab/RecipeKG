It's par for the course with pound-type cakes but worth sharing. I left the butter out overnight and creamed by hand for 30 minutes. Absolutely worth it. The crumb was perfect. Moist and buttery - almost fluffy - but still dense as a pound cake should be. Kudos to the recipe for the ingredients' proportions. They're dead-on. Now onto the dark side. The cake recipe proportions are perfecto BUT the filling might be overkill. Also merely dumping it in the middle of the cake batter and then pouring batter on top ain't always gonna cut it. Some technique is required to keep the sugar from seeping to the sides while baking. When that happens the sugar caramelizes sticks to your greased pan and dismembers portions of your otherwise perfect cake when you flip that sucker over to remove the cake. Just sayin'. I suggest going halves on the sugar filling using a teaspoon to incorporate the stuff only in the very middle of the batter and then slicing through it with a knife to keep the sugar line in-check and relatively thin. Enjoy and thanks for the recipe. It's a good one!",

                "reviewBody": "The fact that the cinnamon-sugar mixture turned hard and crunchy is enough to call this recipe a failure in my opinion. The cake itself is beautiful (until you cut into it), moist and delicious and the cinnamon mixture would undoubtedly have worked better had it been cut in half and then swirled into the batter - but that's not what the recipe directs, unfortunately.  The cake could have been salvaged, I suppose,  if it was \"just\" for family, but since the crunchy middle caused the cake to break apart as you cut it, there was no way I would have Hubs bring this to a business meeting tomorrow as was my intent.  The cake was tossed, which obviously was very disappointing.  This is a case where I wished I would have read the reviews BEFORE I made the recipe. Since the cake is not a success as written, without significant changes, I can only rate it \"one star\" and caution others before making this cake using the recipe as written. I have to assume that those reviewers who rated this recipe higher and loved it were rating a modified version.",

I baked mine in a 9x13 inch pan, and instead of layering the cinnamon sugar, I just sprinkled it on top and swirled it around with a knife.  It took about 45 minutes to bake, but the center was not set and the top was getting hard becasue of the cinn/sug mixture.  I usually would set a peice of foil on top until it's done, but I let it cook a few more minutes and turned the oven off and let it sit there a while.  The sides did turn out a little dry but I'm still rating this 4, because had I followed the directions as written, it would have turned out just fine.  This is a good cake Diane.",
