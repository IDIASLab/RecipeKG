The pudding firmed up right away so I didn't bother waiting the five minutes before adding the whipped topping (which wasn't thawed but incorporated well anyways with a whisk) Followed directions as written except omitted the chocolate chips. Chilled for about and hour and served. The graham crackers were a still a little crunchy but everyone said they loved it just the way it was. The little bit leftover was eaten right away the next day by my son and he said he liked it either way with soft or crunchy crackers. Anyways thanks for the post. I think we have found a new favorite!",
