If you stir too quickly, they won't caramelize and get crispy. They will still be wonderful, but they won't have that extra touch.\n\nOtherwise I found that adding slices of carrots can be a wonderful change, and also spicing the potatos with curry powder or paste.",

I'm not very patient so after cubing the potatoes, I cooked them in the microwave for about 7 min, which didn't cook them but certainly sped up the frypan part. Also, I subbed veg oil for the shortening (and less of it).  Honestly, they're a little plain as is BUT served as a side to a hot plate of scrambled eggs (and a little melted butter over them), they were tasty and filling.",

Instead of using regular potatoes, I used some frozen hashbrowns I have had in my freezer for ages.  I sauteed them in some butter and olive oil rather than shortening.  I wish I would have sauteed some onions and bell peppers to go along with these, but didn't think of that until the potatoes were almost done.  Of course I added a little dash of onion powder along with the garlic and gave it a hefty dose of freshly ground black pepper.  Thanks for sharing.  Hey \"D\"...these are right up your alley!!",
