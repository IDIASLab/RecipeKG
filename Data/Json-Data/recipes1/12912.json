(I love to eat the sweet and tender fruit straight from the tree and couldn't keep up with so many coming off each day.)  My neighbor told me that her mother used to make fig preserves with lemon thinly sliced in them, so after making this recipe I gave her a jar of them with a pan of hot biscuits straight from the oven. It was a delight watching this 82-year-old woman literally devour two buttery biscuits filled with these figs. She was so thrilled and said that they tasted exactly like those that her Mother made many years ago.   Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.",

Figs are a low-acid food (ph below 5) and this means that mold and harmful bacteria will likely form UNLESS the fruit mixture has some kind of acid added to it (lemon juice, citric acid). The lemons in this are absolutely necessary, for food safety. If you don't use it, then your beautiful preserves are extremely like to make you sick, or could even kill you. Do not take that risk--ADD THE LEMON JUICE.",
