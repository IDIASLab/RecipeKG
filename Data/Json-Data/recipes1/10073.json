I increased baking time to 12 minutes because I have silver reflective cookie sheets. The came out with an excellent texture all over and through the cookie. The moisture level is perfect and the use of the clove and cinnamon gave a discrete flavour of a molasses or a spice cookie -- but with a lighter batter instead of dark. The bits of dates if chopped to proper size offers a wonderful burst of extra moist chewiness through the cookie. I was extremely pleased with this recipe and may try out the same excellent batter with other types of fruits such as chopped cherries or perhaps sultanas or figs.",

I recommend leaving them in the oven for a full 10 minutes and following the recipe instructions of letting them cool on the cookie sheets for five minutes. This way they will be slightly crisp on the outside to contrast with the soft inside. I tried the first batch for 8 minutes (plus 5 minutes cooling time on the sheet) and they were undercooked...and mine were kind of small. I got 8 dozen from the recipe. Next time I will substitute the cinnamon for cardamon and use almonds (instead of walnuts..didn't have pecans). Spiced that way it should make an excellent cookie to serve with Arabic coffee.",
