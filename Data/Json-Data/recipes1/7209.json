I saw that the ingredients were the same in this recipe, so I went for it.  I was looking for a recipe with applesauce, since my baby decided he was no longer going to eat baby food, so I had a freezer full of applesauce to use up.  I am so glad this recipe was posted here!  All the ingredients are readily available in any cook's kitchen.  The only problem I had was that the casserole dish I used was too small, and the apple butter cooked out and splattered all over my oven.  Next time, I may try someone else's recipe suggestion and put it in the crock pot all day.  This recipe makes your house smell AWESOME!  I tried some on a ritz cracker and I almost couldn't stop eating it.  I look forward to making this recipe again, possibly for Christmas gifts!  I didn't think I liked apple butter, but after making and tasting this recipe, I am convinced that this apple butter is quite possibly the best fall food ever!",
