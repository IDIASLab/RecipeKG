Salt didn't need to be added because the soysauce is salty enough-the water didn't need to be added because it waters down the flavor and adding 1 to 2 bay leaves are a big part of this recipe. There are also several variations to cooking this recipe. Traditional stove top cooking can be  messy so baking is great, leave the skin side up and broil for 10 mins, crunchy chicken skin is \"ono\"\r\n(delicious) and the crockpot is the other alternative cooking method. For those of us who work and just want to come home and EAT. I hope this was helpful : )",

I personally skin whole pieces of chicken and place them in a baking pan.

The chicken comes out VERY tender and full of flavor.  The juices in the pan are used as a topping to hot jasmine rice.  This is a one pan dish in our house and fixed at least 3 times a month!",

While the dish is generally characterized by saltiness (Filipinos love salty and sweet flavors) it shouldn't be overwhelmingly salty so you should be able to cut the salt. The sherry vinegar really makes it special.",

Then added apple cider vinegar and lite soy in the amounts given. I added water to cover the chicken (didn't measure) added a huge bay leaf (or 2 small ones) and the juice of a lime. I let simmer on medium for 25-30 minutes until the juices reduced...I could hear the pot sizzling...that's how reduced. We all loved it...not too salty and the hint of lime is beautiful.
