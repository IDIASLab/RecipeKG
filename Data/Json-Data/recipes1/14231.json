I don't add yogurt to my baingan bharta, but adding it isn't a sin, i wouldn't heat the dish after adding yogurt. Also, the eggplant is usually fire roasted and the smokey flavor is just outstanding. Also a small teaspoon of lemon juice in the end brings all the flavors out.",

I made the eggplant the day before just to save time; I cut it in half lengthwise, sprayed the cut side with Pam, and then baked it on a foil lined cookie sheet, cut side down. I baked it for 20 minutes or so and it was so tender that I just scraped it out of the skin with a spoon. I used a can of plum tomatoes instead of a tomato, and cut the tomatoes into a small dice. I saved the liquid and added it to the dish right before I started to simmer it. I also added about a cup of frozen baby peas at the same time as the eggplant. Used ginger paste and minced garlic. Great recipe.",

I made it as a side with chicken curry and spinach paneer (frozen entree)and rice- the eggplant stole the show!  I used a medium eggplant- didn't bother peeling, just scooped out the cooked inards and chopped them up with a spoon.  I added 3/4 jalapeno in with the onion, thinking otherwise it would be too spicy, but it was not.  Thought yogurt might separate when cooked so aggressively, but it did not!  I didn't have ginger-garlic paste, just added a little fresh of each.  Easy and healthy!  Serve to all of your vegetarian friends!",

There used to be a restaurant in Westwood that I would trek up to for this dish, but alas, they closed down thanks to this bum economy.. =(  This recipe saved the day though!  I made a couple changes after the dry run after following some other reviews.  I bake the eggplant until it's tender, and just scrape it out of the skin with a spoon.  Also, I add petite frozen peas at the same time as the eggplant because that's the way it was made at the restaurant I used to go to. As for the curry powder, I used garam masala instead, which is an Indian spice blend that really makes it authentic.  And if you find the flavors are too strong, mix in some yogurt after you're done cooking or let it stand overnight.  (Mine was much more mild the next day, but tasted more cohesive - if that makes any sense to anyone other than me...)",
