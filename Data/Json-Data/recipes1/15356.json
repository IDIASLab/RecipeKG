They turned out to be very sticky chewy and not tasting like lemon. I ended up adding a lot more flour to the rest of the batter which helped a little. I think if I had switched the amounts of flour and brown sugar listed in the recipe and added more lemon juice & zest it would probably have turned out better.",

The flour made it not turn into one huge cookie...but the flavor was very unpleasant. Nothing like what it should have tasted like.:(",
