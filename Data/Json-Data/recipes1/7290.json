I added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to the pot (that seems to get rid of the \"canned broth\" smell somehow). I've never made a recipe where meatballs weren't browned first, but I didn't pre-cook them. The soup wasn't greasy and the meatballs weren't too anemic loooking. I used my small cookie scoop for the meatballs and it was easy and quick! I used orzo pasta and precooked it and added it to the soup right at the end to avoid having it absorb all the broth. The best thing  was that my husband was pretty sure he was not going to like this soup and after he tried it, he liked it a lot.",

Omitted the onion because I had none. Still delicious.\n\nMy tip is to drop the meatballs into the soup slowly, going around the pot so they don't all sit on top of each other. The meatballs will rise to the top as they cook. Once most of the meatballs have risen (about 4 minutes), then stir gently. Don't stir when you initially put the meatballs in.\n\nGreat recipe Lalena. Thanks so much!",

I decided to bake the meatballs @ 350 degrees for 15 minutes on a broiler pan to drain some of the extra fat. I did double the breadcrumbs on the meatballs - a personal preference. I just dumped the meatballs into the soup mixture for the last 5 minutes of cooking. I doubled the pasta to make it a thicker soup and added a dash of garlic powder to the broth. When served with parmesean on top it was awesome.",

These are my favorite part of the soup, so I always make more rather than less.  They also add more flavor to the soup.
