I did substitute vanilla bean paste for vanilla. I was out and did not want to go to the store. I did double the amount of vanilla because I wanted that extra bump of flavor! I creamed the butter and sugar till it was a very and I mean very light yellow almost white! This to me made a difference. I used all exact measurements other then the vanilla. The dough was crumbly at first. I took the dough out of the bowl and ran it in circles on the counter till it formed a nice ball with no crumbs falling off. Maybe about 1 min. I cut in to two smaller balls I flattened into a disk wrapped with plastic wrap and put into fridge for 20 min. When I took the first out to roll between the parchment it was easy, mess free. The cookies baked about 5-7 min. till they was just turning brown on the edges. I took them out and let cool. They puffed nicely did not spread much. They had a great vanilla, buttery flavor. About my baking time I always take my cookies out about 1-2 min before what is called for because like all things even cookies keep cooking even when they are removed from heat at first. This also helps me keep my cookies softer longer. I'm only giving it 4 stars due to my change of vanilla. Also mix the flour on low or fold in till incorporated. Don't over mix it!",

In the end I gave up trying to make cut-out cookies and instead rolled the dough into balls with my hands and flattened them out into colorful circles. After the cookies were baked they had a nice flavor but were very dry. I am an avid baker and I don't suggest this recipe. If you are planning to make it definitely take the advice of the reviewers who tweaked this one. Use whole eggs and a bit less flour. The Reynold's Parchment paper really was the saving grace for these cookies. I think they would have been burned or been too fragile if they were baked on an unlined cookie sheet. They had perfectly browned bottoms and slid right onto the cooling rack thanks to the parchment.",

It's important to chill the dough in a flat disc and then when you're ready to roll and cut the cookies allow it to rest at room temperature for about 5-10 minutes after removing from the fridge. This prevents the dough from being too crumbly while rolling. Using Reynold's parchment paper to roll them out meant no sticking and almost no cleanup. I loved the taste they aren't too sweet which means you can add icing and candy and not get a crazy sugar rush! My girls loved them too!",
