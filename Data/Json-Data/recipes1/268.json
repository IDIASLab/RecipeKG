(ages 3-12)\r\n\r\nI also tried rolling the balls in another package of grape Jello, to add more flavor, but I thought that it made the outside of the cookies kindof sour.  (Probably why the kids liked them...)  Next time I may try lemon or cherry flavor, and roll the balls in plain sugar, and then flatten them.  You will need to  add extra food coloring, as the coloring in the jello really isn't enough to color the entire batch of dough.\r\n\r\nI used my Pampered Chef small scooper to make identical sized cookies, and ended up with exactly 43 cookies.  I also baked them on parchment for 7 minutes.  Still soft inside, and only slightly browned on the bottoms.\r\n\r\nOver all, this was a good sugar cookie and they were very simple to make.",
