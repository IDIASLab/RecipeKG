Although I used sausage I think next time I'll use a combo of sausage and either ground turkey or beef. I added more seasonings plus some mozarella and parm and brushed the top of the dough with olive oil and seasoned with garlic and onion powders. Once the sausage was almost completely browned which by the way takes way longer than five minutes I pulsed the meat in the food processor to break it up more. Great Friday night meal Lisa!",

This didn't affect the taste at all. 2) I added garlic powder Italian seasoning onion powder and crushed red pepper to the mixture. 3) I also added shredded mozz cheese to the pie prior to putting it back into the oven.. 4) I used another reviewer's suggestion and brushed the top crust with olive oil and put a dash of garlic and onion powder on. Brought some extra flavor to the dish. There's a lot that can be done with this. Use your imagination and eat it up! Thanks for a great recipe!",
