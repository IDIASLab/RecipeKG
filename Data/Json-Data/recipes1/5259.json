One tip i would give is - Sear the meat in a heavy based pan to seal the breadcrumbs and then transfer the pan to the oven. Cook with butter in the pan and you get the best of both worlds.  Also, add some mixed herbs to the Parmesan cheese to sprinkle over chicken, before you put it in the oven and it will form a beautiful crust. You can use this formula for any light meats, i've used turkey, pork and lamb all turned out great.",

Thanks K grecco, for a terrific, easy dinner dish. The only thing I did different was to set the oven higher, 450F and then I turned it down 5 mins into the cooking time. This is a keeper.",

If you like chicken with a crispy breaded coating, this recipe is for you.  We thought there was a nice but not overpowering garlic flavor.  I only needed 1 cup of bread crumbs.  I added about 1/8 cup of Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs, but it could have used even more.  I melted the butter with the chopped garlic in a small skillet, then turned it down to low and dipped the chicken directly into the butter then into the bread crumbs.  I baked 4 rather large boneless skinless breasts for 45 minutes, which was plenty.  40 minutes would have probably been enough.",
