If it was being compared to real gnocchi, I'd probably only give it a 4.  I really was expecting to hate this recipe because I HATE instant mashed potatoes.  You would never know there was anything instant with these gnocchi.  On a whim I decided to serve Good Friday dinner, I was a little strapped for time and served these to my Italian husband and mother in law.  My husband knew what was in them and said they were not as good as the real thing, but very very close!  I didn't tell my mother in law, she had second helpings and liked them!  I would use this again!  It takes some time to prepare, but it saved time from peeling the potatoes, boiling, ricing, letting them cool so you can add eggs, etc.  As others have mentioned add flour gradually.  Dough should be soft not stiff.  Too much flour makes tough gnocchi.",

I never knew a good ratio though so I was so glad when I found this because with real potatoes is a lot of work when you have 2 year old twins. I will definitely be making this again. I didn't need as much flour as the recipe called for. It does get very sticky but that is how it should be. After you mix it all together into a dough, if you put it on a floured cookie sheet in the fridge for at least 15 minutes, it will make it a ton easier to work with. It will get stickier as it warms though. Also, if you roll them 1/2\"  thick, they will be less dumpling like as some people stated. I found this recipe to be extremely good and will definitely be making them again! ",

I was looking for recipes that would freeze well and stumbled upon this one.  Excellent!  I did take the advice of another reviewer and seasoned with rosemary instead of pepper.  The rosemary flavor jumped out beautifully in the finished product.  I also added a bit of Romano cheese to the dough.  I couldn't taste it so it either needs more or should just be left out.  I want to emphasize that my husband is a food snob.  He has eaten at some of the finest restaurants in the U.S.  He never \"LOVES\" what I make.  It is always \"okay\" or \"fine.\"  A constant critic of gnocchi in restaurants, he loved this one!  I could see trying to make it a little lighter in texture, fiddling with flavors, etc, but this is a great base recipe to work with.  Enjoy!",

I agree they needed a little kick so I added some finely minced fresh basil, and garlic salt to the dough.  I also used the fork \"dent and pull\" method to set the ridge pattern in them. People say you should make those little indentations with a fork so that the sauce has something to cling to.  It did work and there were little puddles of sauce hidden in all the wrinkles.  YUM-O!

I recommend being heavy handed with seasonings and adding seasoning salt, garlic powder, rosemary and Italian seasoning to the dough.  As suggested by others, I would add some Romano next time myself.  And I would double this recipe if feeding another person, seeing as I ate the whole batch myself no problem!

I'm excited to try some of the flavor variations that others have mentioned.  Just two notes:  Keeping the size of each dumpling quite small (about the size of your thumbnail or a bit bigger) will produce a better result.  Also, I didn't need anything even close to 1 1/2 c. of flour.  I doubt I used even half of that.  So, add the flour very slowly--too much will result in dense, tough gnocchi.",
