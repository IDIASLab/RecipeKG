Now I'll admit - I like it cold - not warm - that's just the way my family always ate it.  Also - my Granny always tossed her potatoes with white vinegar right after they came out of the pot and drained (about 2 TBSP for each 2 Pounds of potatoes).  Then waited for the potatoes to get just warm and tossed them with the dressing.  I just don't think you can replace that soaked in vinegar flavor with ANY dressing and I love it that way.  Also - unless you like \"mashed potato\" salad - ALWAYS mix everything but the potatoes in a separate bowl and then GENTLY FOLD it into the vinegar coated potatoes while they are warm.  Seve it warm - or let it sit in the fridge overnight - YOUR CHOICE.  Omit anything from this recipe that you DON't like in your potato salad - but the portions of all the ingredients are right on!!!",

I used Yukon Gold potatoes for their buttery, creamy texture.  We like our potato salad chilled so I boiled the potatoes, skin on and then refrigerated them overnight.  The skin peels off easily after chilled.  The next day I put it all together.  I like to make my dressing in a separate bowl so it gets really combined before pouring it over the potatoes and celery.  I added about 2 Tbsp. minced onion, a scant 1 Tbsp. cider vinegar and about 2 tsp. sugar to the dressing mixture.  Only used about 2 Tbsp. sweet relish and less mustard. It'll need a good amount of salt and pepper too. If you are concerned about fat you can replace about half of the mayo with reduced fat sour cream and get a really good result.  This is a winner!",

I add another egg, cut the mustard in half and use a mix of lite Miracle whip and lite mayo.  Everyone has their own personal tastes when it comes to potato salads and this one is simple and a very good base to add or subtract whatever you like. Mix the dressing separately from the potatoes and eggs and then toss and you can't go wrong.",

I made another batch and cut the potatoes in half before boiling them, this time they got done but I think I used too much mustard. I was able to cut the taste a bit by adding a little sugar. A previous reviewer asked what size potatoes to use - I used a little less than 2.5 LBS (about 38 oz) and AA Large eggs. Another tip is to cool the potatoes before you cut them up or it will be mushy. Next time I will cut the mustard to 1 or 1.5 TBSpoons.",

I peeled and cubed potatoes and nuked them in the microwave (put in a plastic bowl, covered potatoes with water, covered 3/4 of bowl with plastic wrap and set for 10 minutes, took out and drained in colander) instead of boiling. I used garlic powder and was very generous with the salt and pepper. I chopped one dill pickle as I was out of relish. This tastes even better after the flavors have a chance to meld together in the fridge. Thank you for taking the time to share with us Bobbye!",
