Avoid any temptation to substitute lower quality, pre-processed or packaged ingredients for the sake of time or convenience.  Using half and half instead of heavy cream, processed potatoes instead of fresh, or canned chicken broth instead of homemade will ruin this dish.

I used 4 leeks, added a bit more butter, increased the cooking time to 20 minutes in step 1 and to 1 hour in step 2. After the puree stage, I whisked in my heavy cream, and I used a full 2 cups to achieve the type of rich and creamy texture I am used to in this dish. I then covered and chilled, and garnished with chives before serving with Awsomely Easy Sesame Asparagus and Garlic Butter bread (recipes also on this site) for a fabulous meal last night.

                "reviewBody": "Just a note about the history and uses of this basic recipe... Most people believe the chef who invented vichyssoise was French, working in America; his name was Louis Diat, working at the Ritz-Carlton in NYC.  He based the recipe on his mother's leek and potato soup, which is an old French classic hot winter soup.  His innovation is trying it as a cold summer soup.  So, those who have (sensibly) tasted it hot and found how good it is, are just discovering a classic French soup.  And yes, it can be bland, which is why the French often use herbs when making it.\n  Note on the bay leaf, I graded this recipe down because it is always necessary to remove bay leaves before blending or serving and the recipe does not mention that. They can actually be dangerous.  The only bay that can be left in is the powdered version (which does not last as long).  My other objection is that the recipe should mention that leeks need to be cleaned carefully to get out any sand.  It should also say \"white part only\" which is the most easily usable part.",

This recipe was easy to follow and the soup came out amazing. Instead of a blender I used a hand mixer right in the pot. The only suggestion I have is to cut the potatoes into small cubes because the hand mixer doesn't blend it as smooth as the blender so I had small chunks of potatoes and onions in the final product. My boyfriend LOVED the soup he said it was better than some of the vichyssoise they serve is restaurants. ALL THUMBS UP!!!",
