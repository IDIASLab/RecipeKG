I tossed the marinated chicken in the bread crumbs in a gallon sized ziploc bag and placed back into pan. You don't want too much italian dressing on the bottom of the pan at this point or it will turn out too mushy. At end of cooking time I removed foil topped with shredded parmesan and turned the oven to broil just for a few minutes till nicely browned. I think this gave it a nice touch. Very tasty and moist chicken. Good to serve with a pasta side dish.",

I marinated the bird bits in a baggie w/ the dressing for as long as I could then rolled in crumbs. I baked on racks on a cookie sheet so the air could move around the breasts and they came out juicy and crispy and wonderful! The dressing I used had a touch of sweetness I wish I'd added a little salt pepper and red pepper to the marinade but that's not the recipes fault. With my changes we will make this over and over.",
