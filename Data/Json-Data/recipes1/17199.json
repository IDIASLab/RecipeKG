I also plan to give jars of it as gifts for Christmas. Thank Robert for sharing your recipe. I no longer have to go to a gourmet butcher shop to get excellent Italian sausage!",

Didn't even use casings to make sausage but mixed it all together in a bowl. Highly recommend esp if you have ground turkey and don't know what to do with it!",
