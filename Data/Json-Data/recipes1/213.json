They asked if you could make some!\"  So I just made a batch of 50 last night!\n\nNot sure if anyone mentioned this tip, but it's easy to tell they're done when they're hard to the touch in the oven.  You're not looking for a golden brown at ALL - just give it a light touch and if they're stiff, you're done!",

I added 1/4 powdered sugar to make them a bit sweeter.  I added another 1/4 flour or so to get the consistency right for my cookie shooter.  To test the dough's consistency, give it a pinch.  If it doesn't stick to your fingers you're good to go.  I colored one batch green and used a tree stencil for my press.  I decorated with non-pariels (sprinkles that look like tiny, colored balls) and put a star on top for darling Christmas trees.  The other batch I left white and sprinkled with colored sugars. Lovely. UPDATE: My husband proclaimed these the BEST shortbread he's ever tasted!",

I was a little disappointed with this recipe when the dough was so thick it wouldn't go through my brand new cookie press!  I make shortbread every year, but never with a cookie press.  I made the kind you bake whole in a deep pan, then cut into bars.  Anyways, my solution with this one was to add another 1/2 cup of butter.  The cookies needed closer to 13 mins to cook, and in the end I got 4 dozen out of a 2 dozen scaled recipe.  Overall taste was pretty good, but I think this one is more a bar cookie recipe.",

This recipe does work well with the cookie press but as soon as you are done whipping them up, you need to get them pressed asap.  The discs are in order from easier to most difficult to work with.  I used a #7 (Christmas tree) which was moderate in difficulty to use.  I find that if you give the press a 1/4-1/2 squeeze, then a full squeeze (unti it clicks), the cookie comes out beautifully.  Just make sure to press out all of the dough at one time, use parchment paper if needed.",
