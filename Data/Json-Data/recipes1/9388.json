This year I separated the dough into halves left one half vanilla and then separated the 2nd half into thirds. I added cocoa powder to one red coloring to another and green to the third and then marbled the cookies. I coated the outside with chocolate sprinkles. I do recommend using somethihg like beaten egg white to coat the logs before rolling in nuts or sprinkles as they adhere better. They came out so pretty and tasted great and were the highlight of my cookie tray. (The following is my old review). Thank you again! I had to try these since I've missed the cookies I used to buy in New York bakeries and these were definitely it! I did leave out the walnuts but instead tried to recreate some of the versions I remembered. I made the recipe twice; the first I left plain and used chocolate stars as a shortcut on some dotted some with chocolate chips and dipped some in chocolate sprinkles. For the 2nd batch I took about half the dough (maybe a tad less) and added about 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa (and about 1 tsp of milk to make up for the dryness) and then swirled it together as I formed the log to make a marbled cookie (my remembered favorite version). I rolled the marble log in chocolate sprinkles and boy were they good and very impressive looking!",

I have also pressed the center dot into chocolate jimmies. If you run into someone who knows what a Chinese Cookie is they will fall over when they taste them. EXCELLENT",

I'm not making sense but I followed the recipe exactly except for the walnuts and the cocoa powder. sigh I had so much hopes for this cookie but I guess I'm doing it wrong.
