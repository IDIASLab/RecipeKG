I made exactly as written, tasted, and then added more of each sauce ingredient (except peanut butter).  If I were to make this again, I think at a minimum, I\u2019d add some shredded carrots and maybe even some very thinly-sliced red bell pepper for just a bit better eye appeal.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

I cut down on the sugar (only 1 T) added peanut butter nuked for softness for a few seconds and used Udon noodles for authenticity .  My friends were blown away at how good it was.  Definitely a keeper.",
