I finally found that if I put the bowl of icing over a saucepan w/ simmering water and stir often, it will stay smooth and spread easily.",

I substituted liquid hazelnut coffee creamer for the cream and eliminated using any extract flavoring.  This was sooooo good.  Frosting hardened on the cookie just like I wanted.  Could store cookies between wax paper without smudging any frosting.  You need to work fairly quickly frosting the cookies.  I just kept stirring in between.  Didn't have any problems at all.  My adult kids and grandkids just loved this.  Will make again.",

I added a touch more vanilla, just because we like it (you can use clear vanilla if you need whiter icing).

This works great! It hardens, but NOT too hard. yet was soft enough for us to eat. All my gingerbread man decorations stayed on perfect! This frosting is also Creamy and flavorful and you dont need alot on any cookie to get the benefits of it.(sweetness wise) - which makes it go further. I made the mistake of coating a cookie with it completely, and wow! overkill! You just need a little bit to get that sweet flavor and really perk up the cookies. All my colors blended in nicely too. If the mix starts to get a little hard while you are doing other things, just stir in a little hot water till you get the consistency back that you need. It will still harden up later with no problems. You can also nuke icing bags for 10 seconds if the icing hardens in it as well. Im going to use this recipe forever! thanks!",

I usually use a wonderful tasting buttercream but the problem is it never seems to harden (one reason why I like it so much just not good when cookies must touch each other). I used milk in place of cream and almond extract instead of vanilla. I melted the butter in the microwave and added everything else to that in the same mixing bowl. You have to work fast because the icing sets up very quickly. Luckily it reheats well in the microwave since it sets up quickly in the bowl too! This is a very good icing recipe for cookies and I bet it would be great drizzled over things like cinnamon rolls or coffee cakes too. I would stick to a thicker fluffier buttercream type frosting for cakes or for decorating with tips but this is excellent for when you want something that will harden and that you can maybe stick a few sprinkles into. I'll definitely use it again.",
