The cookies did not flatten out as illustrated rather they remained in little balls and were quite chewy (just how I like them). I just made them again today and I guess I was feeling impatient because I did not beat the ingredients nor did I refrigerate for an hour. I just added all the ingredients together and stirred with a fork. This time they flattened out like the picture and were about 1/4 inch thick....still chewy but much flatter. I a pretty novice baker so maybe this is easily explained. Regardless...a great cookie!! I'm going to go eat one right now!",

Alternatively add finely chopped ginger preserve as well as the ginger powder.",
