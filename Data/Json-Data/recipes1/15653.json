The tortillas add a surprising thickness as the soup cooks, but feel free to omit them if you like a thin broth. Even though it seems like a lot of ingredients, I made this when my fridge was almost bare to make the most of the ingredients I always keep on-hand. Adjust the spices according to your taste and whatever you have in your cupboard.",
