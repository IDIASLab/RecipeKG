I did make quite a few changes right from the get-go, though.  \n\nFirst, I used about twelve cups of florets, three celery stalks, two grated carrots, and one onion.  I cooked the veggies at medium heat for ten minutes, using a mixture of chicken broth and some leftover water from steaming vegetables earlier for dinner.  I didn't puree all of the vegetables.  I left about a cup and a half in their large chunks, since I like having something to chew.  I also tripled the roux, in order to have a creamier soup.  In the roux, I used a small can of evaporated milk, also for a creamier soup.  Once the soup was in the final stages of simmering, I added about half a cup of shredded mozzarella and a half a cup of grated parmesan.\n\nIt turned out wonderfully!  I don't recommend salt and pepper at the outset.  I would suggest that you allow the folks eating your soup to season for themselves.",
