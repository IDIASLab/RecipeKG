Added salt and increased the other seasonings, extra grated cheddar and topped w crushed tortilla chips and sliced black olives since I stuck with the 6 flour tortillas. Baked a little longer as I added the chip topping and olives later. Very good and fast and doesn't dirty up a ton of pans! Next time I may serve atop a bed of shredded lettuce for a healthier one dish meal, tostada style.",

I used soft yellow corn tortillas so it's Gluten Free.  I layered it like this:  a generous layer of the Turkey mixture, then shredded Mexican cheese blend,  on top of that. Then 6 Tortillas. Layered the rest  of the meat mixture . Then another 6 Tortillas. Added Mexican Cheese blend on top of the tortillas. Baked for 20 min. Sprinkled sliced black olives on the top. Served with sour cream. Everyone loved it.",
