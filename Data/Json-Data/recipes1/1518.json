I'm always watching my weight so i wanted a low fat cookie that didn't taste low fat. I tried this recipe and these cookies are fantastic. This recipe will definately become one of my signature dishes from now on. I couldn't find candied citron so i made my own version by boiling lemon peals and then simmering them in simple syrup (1 c sugar 1 cup water) for about 20 minutes. Everything turned out great.",

Other customers said they will be a cookie that they will ask for again next year when they place their cookie tray orders. Thanks for making my life simpler with this great recipe.",
