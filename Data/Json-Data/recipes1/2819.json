Mushrooms cooked in white & red wine/broth reduction. I diced up 1 can of pears to add at end and used wine/broth reduction to moisten. I don't think I ever had better stuffing/dressing!! It was absolutely delicious...can't imagine if I had wild shrooms!!! I'm not fond of the texture of the dried thyme and rosemary \"needles\"...will grind them up better next time.
