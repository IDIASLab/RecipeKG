It does only make one small cake but to be frank it's VERY rich (as if the 4lbs of chocolate doesn't give THAT away!) so almost everyone in the office was able to snag a little piece. (I filled a pan w/ six little tulip-shapped slots and about a half a bread pan) One thing I did notice anyone with a strong aversion to DARK chocolate gave a 'too rich' answer. To answer some questions added by a previous reviewer on instructions. When you whip (Unless you're looking for a REALLY good work out use a mixer not a whisk!) sugar and egg the color will actually lighten a bit to a very soft yellow and it will about double in size. Basically blend the out of it and when it won't poof up anymore you're there.:) This cake is also VERY easy to over bake which is what would make it dry! You can't do the toothpick test on this one since there is SO much chocolate most of it won't completely solidify until it has cooled. As the instructions say use the poke test it shouldn't be hard but as soon as there is resistance take it out you're done! I'm not sure about refrigerating however I had to because I baked it a day in advance and I didn't trust to leave it out w/ the dog all day but I FULLY Suggest warming it up when you serve it! It will be very fudge/brownie like when cold but softens right up again if you heat it up a little. I do also agree on the suggestion for using raspberries with it.",

The birthday girl (30 ) I made it for who's a chocoholic absolutely loved it. As another reviewer wrote it needed 50-minutes to cook and I used a whisk instead of folding to incorporate everything.",

                "reviewBody": "Hints for the inexperienced and experienced baker:  The nine inch pan should be at least 2 inches high.  In step #2 it states to whip the eggs and sugar to full volume.  This means you should use an electric mixer on high for at least 10 minutes or more until the eggs mixture looks like lemon chiffon (yellow should be the color of the inside of the lemon and fluffy/frothy looking).  The more you whip the more air you incorporate in to the mixture which is needed for this type of cake.  IF you don't do this the cake will be too dense not cook throughly in the middle.  If you read some of the other reviews you will see this happened on occasion.  Remember to fold in the chocolate and cake flour and not use the electric mixture.  I also used Kerry Gold Butter which is usually located in the gourment cheese section of your grocer.  Make sure the butter is thoroughly melted before you mix it in with the chocolate melted in your double boiler.  IF you do not have a double boiler, put a small pan in a larger pan filled 1/4 way with water.  I baked this cake in a convection oven at 335 for 45 minutes.  Otherwise, follow the temp and cook time in step 4.  It came out perfect.  I served it warm with a scoop of Breyer All Natural Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, drizzled with a raspberry sauce and fresh whipped cream.   Remember, if you do not incorporate enough air into the egg/sugar mixture the cake will be undone in the center.",

Should the cake be refrigerated before serving like other decadence cakes? The center of this cake didn't completely cook at 35 minutes and no chilling but no one seemed to mind!",
