Note, this is what I'd call a basic \"milk & cookies\" type of cookie. Sort of thing mom would fill the cookie jar with back in the 1960's  :-)  Used some of the mods others suggested, namely: 1 cup butter, 1 1/4 cups honey, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. Also changed the procedure to make it easier: sifted together the dry ingredients; transferred the melted sugar, butter & honey to the mixer; once cooled, added vanilla & eggs then the flour. The bottoms of the cookies came out smoother when I used parchment paper. Also tried different baking times. (My oven is dead on temp-wise; checked with thermometer.) 11 minutes is not enough - they are too chewy (almost doughy) and deflate into cow pies when cool. 14 to 15 minutes is perfect - they turn out light brown with some crispness around the edges but moist in the center. Perfect for dunking in milk. :-)  Very strong honey flavor. I used a dark clover honey. Might be interesting to try with different honey types.",

This recipe is so simple centered around specific sugars and fats - if you mess with either you're going to change the entire structure of the cookie. Period. I only had butter-flavored shortening and fresh grated ginger so that was my change. I used a lovely raspberry honey from the local farmers market (I hate clover honey). They came out puffy and cake-like out of the oven but deflated on the cooling rack as pictured. You end up with a lightly sweet aromatic tea cookie. Tip: DON'T OVERCOOK THESE - you will get hockey pucks. (Trust me.) You just want them lightly golden. Mine only took the 12 minutes and my oven usually takes longer to bake. OPTIONAL: for those who think this recipe could use something extra: I mixed the zest of one grapefruit into half of the batter (honey ginger grapefruit=heaven) with excellent results. Just an essence of citrus on top of the honey goodness - amazing. These tasted best just after they cooled but stayed moist and good wrapped in foil for several days.",
