You'll want to have something to go with this that has some protein, like a garden burger or a brown rice packet, both of which you can microwave. Apples and onions only takes about 10 minutes, a few dollars and it's delicious as a topping for rice or even by itself for a light snack.",

The cumin was a nice addition. I didn't have balsamic vinegar...just used apple cider vinegar & it was fine. I sliced some beef sausage links and browned them as a side to the apples. Served with a small side salad and garlic bread. very tasty meal with a different twist. Will make it again and share. Quick & easy.",
