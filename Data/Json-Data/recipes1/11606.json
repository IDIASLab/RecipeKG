I think the dressing in this recipe is missing a key ingredient - the Ramen seasoning packet - be sure and add it to the oil vinegar and sugar mixture. Note that it really makes a difference to toast the almonds and sunflower seeds before adding them. I like to let the salad sit for a few hours in the refrigerator so that the cabbage wilts a little the noodles hydrate and the flavors meld then I add the almonds and sunflower seeds just before serving. Thanks for the recipe!",

I used 1/3C oil 4T vinegar & 3T sugar along w/ 2 seasoning packets from the Ramen noodles. This is a great side dish for a summer BBQ.",

NOTE: the green onions are the KEY in this recipe if you ask me.. I made it the first time w/out any, as i didn't have any and needed to use the pkg'd slaw up fast.. it was ok, but missing that certain zing. Next time, i made sure i had green onions, and that made all the difference!!!    ps- oriental flavored spice packets made the best tasting dressing... ",
