For the soft bread cubes wasn't for sure what it meant so I tore about regular loaf bread slices for it-you can see them in it one thing I didn't like. And I used chicken broth instead of the oyster juice. Someone also told me to use the instead of the cornbread not the edges or bottoms. It's delicious! Can't wait for the rest of the family to try it! Thanks!",
