I use about one stick of real butter. I cook the noodles until almost done and finish them in the sauce and then throw in cooked sliced chicken.

Came out fantastic and made this close to the recipe (only 1 sick of butter and I probably used double the chopped shallot because I'm terrible at \"eyeing\" things). I've made it a few other ways but honestly this was the easiest and the best and it didn't break (WIN!). I can see a little lemon zest in this next time or maybe even some dill? The trick to strain it was so simple yet so what I had NOT been doing - why did I not think of this? Thanks for that! You do need to babysit this closely like any cream/acid sauce and once it's time to add the butter (have it very cold and very close) you must whisk non-stop or it will break for sure. I frequently pull it off the heat add a chunk of butter and whisk and if it isn't melting well return to the burner for 10-15 seconds to get up to melting temp - but don't let boil - repeat over and over until butter is all incorporated. Awesome over my crabmeat stuffed tilapia and prosciutto roasted asparagus! THANK YOU!",
