A couple of suggestions here- do make fresh pizza dough and _do_- fry it as suggested. Do not deep fry but pan fry. The dough takes on a completely different texture and flavor that really supports the flavors. I would suggest also sauteeing the apples until just done- and if they are not very sweet adding a little sugar to bump that up. The apples should be _just_ on the sweet side. Finally I would strongly consider blending the feta with a little bit of oil and spooning it on_top_ of the apples before baking. Feta cheese doesn't always melt very well. Making a sort of spread out of it will help enormously.",
