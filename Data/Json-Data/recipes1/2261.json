I found that the cake didn't require further baking after 45 minutes, so many thanks to all of you that posted the warnings about cooking times.  The cake that emerged from the oven was visually tempting, and its cinnamon-vanilla aroma was pleasantly appealing...but when I  served it up for dessert, still warm,  with ice cream, it didn't go down a storm.  Everyone ate it politely, and there were no overt criticisms but not a one jumped at the chance for seconds or even to take leftovers away with them.  Disappointed, I was preparing to offer the remains of the cake to the birds the next morning when I popped a morsel of it in my mouth, and then immediately wondered what had happened to the one that I had baked because the bird fodder I had in hand could not possibly have been it!! It had a gorgeously moist and tender crumb and a crust that was both crisp and caramelly at the same time. So, unless the fairies stole in overnight and substituted slices of their enchanted food for my floury stodge, this cake *clearly* benefits from having a night to rest - as do we all! I shall definitely make this one again - but the next time it will be a \"make-ahead\" cake for brekkie or brunch.",

When I do make it, about half the recipe is enough and it is fine without the alcohol if you don't have any on hand.",

I cooked it for only 1hr. when the knife came out clean and it was already slightly dry- the recipe said 1 hr.20 min..... on the whole though it was more complicated in terms of texture and taste than most coffee cakes.
