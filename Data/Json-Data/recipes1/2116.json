It is very moist and bakes beautifully in a bundt pan.I have made this many times and made a few minor adjustments to my liking:  I always add more poppy seeds as 1 1/2 TBSP stated in the  recipe of Poppy seeds is NOT enough to make Poppy Seed Bread. I increased it to 1/4 Cup of the seeds and 1 TBSP more of each of the extracts to suit my taste. I also find that the cake does not need the glaze as it's perfect without it. I just sift Icing sugar on top for presentation.  With my minor changes it's perfect and a keeper.",
