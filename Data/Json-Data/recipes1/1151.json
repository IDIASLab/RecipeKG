Given that there are only three of us sharing Christmas I halved the recipe and took some liberties because of what we had in the kitchen as well as trying to match the Empress Fruitcake of Yore. I added dried apricots and some withered blueberries because of what we had on hand and omitted the sultanas and currents going heavier on dates. I also substituted pecans for almonds. My father also wanted the taste of burbon so I soaked the raisins in burbon for a few days drained them well and used the burbon-raisin juice instead of coffee and grape juice. I suggest that you read the recipe carefully for the myriad of steps -- beaten egg whites beaten egg yolks and the flour mixtures all in separate bowls that converge quite quickly. It makes for a BIG project and heavy clean up. The recipe also calls for three differently sized \"Christmas cake\" pans the like of which I've never seen and do not see the reason for -- it's not a stacked cake after all. I used loaf pans and baked the minimum 2 1/2 hours. I used two layers of greased brown paper but only on the bottom of the pans; after running a sharp knife around the greased edges the cakes dropped out easily. The next time I make this (and I think I will -- it did essentially match that acme of fruitcakes from my childhood) -- I won't chop the fruit and nuts as small as I",

Also as others discovered it required at least an hour more baking time than the recipe states so I put a pan of water on the lower oven rack to keep it from drying out. The texture was fine but the heaping helping of cloves gave it a strong medicinal taste that overpowered the other flavors. My mom likes spicy fruitcakes too but she also noticed this. I'm only using two teaspoons of cloves this year instead of the two tablespoons called for and am sure it will come out great.",
