The egg whites form the body or lightness of the cake.  It is extremely important to properly fold the whites into the batter.  Too much folding and you have a flat cake.  Too little folding and you will have \"chewy\" pieces from unincorporated egg white.  The 1/4 c. granulated sugar should be added to the egg whites before whipping, as sugar helps build peaks, prevents overbeating, and dissolves in liquid egg.  I don't know why some reviewers thought white sugar meant powdered sugar, but sponge cakes are made with granulated sugar.  I substituted cake flour (1 c. + 2 T.), added a pinch of salt, and the cake was great.",

Room temperature milk is nasty and you will think this cake is too if you do so (i tried a piece right after frosting it, that's  how i know). I've done this cake twice and i decided to add some sugar and vanilla to the whipping cream the second time to give it more flavor. The second time i also didn't pierce the cake with a fork , i left it in the pan and poured the mixture on it and it soaked it up without any problems and more evenly. The cake came out fluffy and moist and i didn't want to stop eating it. I also liked it better when i separated it into two 8in pans and frosted it in between the two layers.",
