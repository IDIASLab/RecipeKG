I did make a few modifications:  I added a little wine after sauteing the garlic and onions to soften them a bit, threw in a chicken bouillon cube with the milk, and added some chopped chives in top of each serving.  These all probably helped to boost the flavor a bit.\r\n\r\nI like the fact that you get the creaminess, but don't have to add the fat by using milk instead of cream.  I will make this again, and would serve it to guests.",

It was almost too thick so I added more milk.  VERY delicious!  I loved that this was sooo easy to make!

I did add some garlic saltpowder...because I LOVE garlic!! And added a bit more parmesan than called for. I also adjusted the recipe to two servings (because I only had one can of crab meat on hand)...it actually made more like 4 servings with plenty of sauce to go around. I've never added crab to my alfredo before...but it was pretty tasty. I think next time I'll throw in some green onions and perhaps fresh tomatoes for color...I'm a firm believer in adding green onions in with any sort of crab dish!",
