After the pasta was cooked I sauteed it in a couple tablespoons of olive oil and minced garlic and tossed the pasta in with the sauce and let it simmer for 5 minutes to soak in the flavors. Its a gorgeous looking dish and so tasty. A perfect summer meal and I'm sure I'll make this quick meal during the Christmas shopping season. Its comfort food also. Hope I can find fresh basil during the winter months. \r\n",

It certainly doesn't need a pound of pasta. I used 1/2 box and it was more than enough. For a healthier option, use whole wheat fettuccine or spaghetti. It adds flavor to the meal. I used sea scallops instead of bay scallops (what the store had, and my personal preference) and they were great. I just chopped them up into smaller, bite-sized pieces. My mom and sister loved it so much, they kept my copy of the recipe and make it all the time.",
