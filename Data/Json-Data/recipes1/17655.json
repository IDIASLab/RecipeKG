I increased the amount of ham to 8 oz and cut the asparagus into 1 - 1 1/2 inch pieces. Added a bit of chopped red sweet pepper for color. By increasing the amount of ham this became our entree which I served alongside homemade rice pilaf. Excellent! Hubby especially liked the added touch of freshly squeezed lemon. Thank you.",

It may be out of season for asparagus but the store had these lovely thin stalks that were so sweet and tender I just couldn't resist. Luckily I had a chunk of left over ham in the freezer that I chunked up. I also sauteed some red and yellow bell peppers to the first step and those were a wonderful addition. I followed the directions to the letter and the result was perfectly cooked vegetables that were perfectly infused with the smokey ham garlic and lemon. I slurped up the entire thing for dinner. It may be simple but this is one of the best things I've made in a long time.",
