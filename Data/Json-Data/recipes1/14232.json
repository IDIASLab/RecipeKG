For the person who thought they might not have used the right sausage here is a tip: Spanish Chorizo is fully cooked and is in a casing similar to polish sausage. It slices/dices and can be added to anything like cornmeal muffin batter with cheddar cheese. Mexican Chorizo is RAW and crumbles when cooked. Excellent with scrambled eggs for breakfast burritos. I look forward to trying this.",
