So you can imagine everyones surprise when they tasted these fabulous, chocolatey, yummy cookies.  Finally, a cookie I can make without them being little crispy rocks.  Update:  I made these again today but copied the recipe down wrong and used baking powder instead of baking soda.  Found the answer to the problem of them going flat.  They came out all puffy and pretty.  Next time I'll try half baking soda/half baking powder to see if it might improve the texture while maintaining shape.",

I did make some changes, but I firmly believe this would've been an awesome cookie even without them -- so I gave it a full 5 stars.  I did as others and used 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla.  I used 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and 3/4 cup dark cocoa powder.  I cut the flour down to 1 1/4 cups and added a box of white chocolate instant pudding (about 1/2 cup).  I added a teensy bit of salt, 1 cup white chips, a little over 1 cup semi-sweet chips, 1 1/4 cups coconut, 1/4 cup chopped glazed pecans, 3/4 cup chopped walnuts.  I cooked them for 9 minutes, which was perfect for my oven.  I also rolled mine into balls so they'd be little puffed-up balls since I don't like flat cookies.  These are the ultimate craving-killing cookies.  They were amazingly soft, perfectly sweet, and very addictive.",

These are just the right texture and flavour - not too chewy but not too hard, and just the right amount of sweetness. I recommend!",

I took them out of the oven at 8 minutes even though they seemed quite soft. After they'd cooled completely they were crispy around the edges and soft and chewy on the inside. I had rainbow coloured chips that I wanted to use up so substituted them for the white chocolate. The white chocolate would be nicer though and I'll definitely use it the next time but will substitute chopped white chocolate for the chips. I like the way the white chocolate chunks spread a bit while the coolies are baking. Thanks for a delicious treat.",
