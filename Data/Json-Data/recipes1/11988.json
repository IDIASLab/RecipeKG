I could not imagine that it would come close to the sauce I usually make (ground beef and pork.) However I was pleasantly surprised. The taste was great my Italian chef husband was very impressed. I did not include the pepper just personal preference. The sauce was even better the second day. Healthy and taste great you can't beat that.",

After four hours of simmering and the addition of extra garlic and extra jalapeno it didn't taste like anything though it smelled wonderful. I began making additions to help the recipe since I was having company for dinner and didn't want to serve it as it was. I added salt pepper garlic powder red pepper flakes and worcestershire. That helped give it flavor but we all agreed it was still missing something. I am really shocked that the recipe doesn't call for any salt or other seasonings. I have made bolognese before and though it seemed like a recipe that should work it just didn't.",

I used soy milk in place of milk. I omitted the jalepeno because I didn't have any but ground in a spice mix of garlic chilli and basil. I also added in a little dried oregano. Also I had a leftover zuchinni to use up so I grated that up & added it in. It came out great. I put it over penne instead of spaghetti because it's my favorite pasta. I also did not grate parmesan cheese over because we keep kosher & we can't mix dairy products with meat. This is a great recipe! I'm posting a picture of it.",

We adjusted the recipe a little to add more spice: more jalapeno more garlic more basil and a Tablespoon of dry cooking sherry to add a little kick. I served it over wheat spaghetti with Parmesean cheese as a garnish and it was fabulous! I will definitely be making this recipe again. It smells wonderful as it is cooking (I halved the recipe and cooked it for 1.5 hours after all of the ingredients were stirred together) and it looks very impressive. Thanks for this great recipe!!",
