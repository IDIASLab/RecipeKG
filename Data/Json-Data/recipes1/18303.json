Thought my DH might not care for the sage but he raved about the flavor of this dish. My own minor comments: I used kosher salt (sparingly). I sliced the red onion very thin which allowed it to crisp up a bit in the roasting which we loved. I also put the broccoli in a large bowl to coat with the olive oil - think it did a much better job of getting the oil over all parts of the veg. Since I had another dinner item to bake I roasted this at 375 - just took a little longer to finish but with no negative effect.",
