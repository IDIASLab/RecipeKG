My main warning is not to follow the directions too closely adding eggs to boiling hot honey will cook your eggs egg drop soup style. Let the honey cool a bit first. This pie comes out darker than its corn syrup cousin. Overall if you like honey's taste don't be afraid this is a great pie.",

I don't eat sugar so really don't know what a traditional pecan pie is like so I can't compare. I cook a lot with honey (my dad is a beekeeper) and I can tell you that the type of honey you use makes a big difference. If you don't want an overpowering honey flavor then use a light colored mild honey. I use a clover honey which is dark and rich and gives it lots of body. I don't like the store bought clover honey but I'm guessing this would give it an entirely different taste. I've also used palm sugar (2 cups since honey is twice as sweet as other sugars) and is much more similar in flavor and texture to a brown sugar (without the high glycemic index.) For those that have dietary restrictions or prefer a slightly healthier version this recipe is great! I made it with a gluten free crust so my mom could enjoy it too. It was a hit this Thanksgiving.",
