These are perfect as-is, but I just made a batch for Saint Patrick's day with these changes:  cut back a little on the butter, went a little heavy on the marshmallows, and instead of vanilla I added (of course) green food coloring (about 10-12 drops for a double batch) and a few tablespoons of Irish Cream liquor.  After I patted this into a 13x9 pan, I topped it with 1/4 cup each white, milk and semi-sweet chocolate chips, which I had melted and mixed with a tablespoon of butter and another few tablespoons of Irish Cream (this is the top layer of the Irish Cream Truffle Fudge recipe found here!).  It spreads on top in a thin layer.  They're a hit here!!",

The butter and marshmallows amounts were the same. They produced great results. By waiting to add chips until after somewhat cool you keep the chips from melting into the marshmallow and getting messy. I preferred them this way for pops of chocolate flavor.",

They turned a pretty pink and were flecked with the handful of dried mixed berries I threw in for color and interest. I liked this recipe for its addition of vanilla and for the extra gooiness, as the original calls for more Rice Krispies to the same amount of marshmallows. However, after adding four cups of cereal I agree with some others that it needed another half cup. I used an 8x8\" pan for thicker bars. Other than learning I don't care for these made with strawberry flavored marshmallows (tho' I'm sure kids would love it!) these were great!",
