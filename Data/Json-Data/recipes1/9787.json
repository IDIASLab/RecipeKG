One note, however.  A head of leaf lettuce comes in different sizes, and some bacon will render more grease than other bacon.  Adjust the quantities accordingly.  You want the lettuce sufficiently coated so it will wilt, but not drown in the dressing. Also, make sure your lettuce is completely dry.",

She used regular white vinegar, sugar, no lemon juice....crumbled the bacon reserving the drippings pouring off grease a bit. She then added the vinegar and spices and simmered just a bit, then poured it over the torn lettuce (she just used iceberg back then, a bit of sliced onion and no radish) Then she covered the salad with a dinner plate to \"wilt\" the lettuce....It was delicious...and just reading the recipe has the juices flowing and a smile on my face!

I had taken the pan off of the cook top and as I poured the vinegar/lemon juice into the drippings the contents of the pan began to splatter and pop. I stopped pouring I had only poured about half of the vinegar/lemon juice into the pan and quickly rushed the pan over to my kitchen sink to contain the splatters and pops. Once the pan was in the sink the contents exploded in my face. Thankfully I managed to close my eyes but the hand that was still holding the the pan handle got burned pretty bad. After cleaning up I reread the directions to this recipe and it says to add the vinegar lemon juice sugar and pepper to the \"hot bacon drippings\". Am I the only person this has happened to? I read the least favorable reviews on this recipe and no one else mentions this occurring.",
