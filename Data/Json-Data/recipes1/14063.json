If I wasn't fortunate enough to have some leftover vegan orange/cream cheese frosting in the refrigerator, they would have been inedible.  A shame too, because the muffins would have been delicious if I had followed my instinct and not the recipe.  How anyone who follows this recipe exactly can give it a positive review is beyond me.  I give it a two because there's a lot of potential here.",

Yet everytime I have made these quick breads I am quick to notice the taste of either the baking soda or baking powder; I am in the process in trying to eliminate this. I also use three bananas as my egg substitute which seems to work just fine. My advice use the recipe as a guide and let the creative take over the rest.",
