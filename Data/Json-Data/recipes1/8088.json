Otherwise you will taste more cream cheese/sour cream than seasoned cream cheese/sour cream. I also increase the oregano to 1/2 tsp. versus 1/4 tsp. and add 1/8 tsp. of red pepper--it does not overwhelm the dip. I have also used provolone cheese in lieu of the mozzarella cheese. Add or delete peppers onions sausage olives tomatoes etc. This is a very versatile recipe.",
