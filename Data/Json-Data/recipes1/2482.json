I made two batches separately and the only thing I added was 2 tsp of vanilla extract. \nI was consistent with every measurement except the flour which I eyeballed for consistency. I put in enough to make the batter quite thick (even a little lumpy) and whipped it with a fork.\nIn the pan (teflon with butter) the batter stayed together very well and did not easily run away. Only the edges had air bubbles by the time I flipped them, then I watched them rise before my eyes. I used less oil in the first batch and I thought that the first ones weren't as fluffy.\nMy flatmates claimed they had never eaten fluffier pancakes, and I thought they were pretty darn good too, although I may tinker with some seasoning.\nN.B. make sure you're using self-raising flour, plain/all-purpose will leave you with flat, rubbery crepes. Do a tester first to see if the batter works, if not you still have time to tinker.",

It seemed a little thin so I added a little extra flour (maybe less than 1/4 cup)and 2 tsp. vanilla. I don't see any reason to add sugar if you plan to eat them smothered in syrup! Those who rated it badly may have used all purpose flour. Pancake batter like brownies should be left slightly lumpy. I poured them onto a non-stick griddle which I greased lightly with a paper towel dipped in vegetable oil. Turn after the edges look dry and the bubbles on top begin to pop. They will rise beautifully after you turn them. And they tasted great!",
