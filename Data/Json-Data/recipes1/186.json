This proved to be a great recipe despite all the reviews and my children got hooked on it! I glazed the cookies with vanilla glaze (normally meant for bundt cakes) and did use 2 cups of flour as other reviwers suggested. The amount of shortening and butter was fine considering I used a light subsitute but I don't really think that made a difference because the batch I made for the kids used classic butter and they loved it! Also instead of chopped walnuts I used ground walnuts no one in my family being big on nuts! If these cookies didn't work the first time I would consider trying them again with the recommended changes and I can assure you your whle family will be begging for more! Thanks Stacy Mae",
