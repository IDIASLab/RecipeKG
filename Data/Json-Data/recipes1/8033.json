I didn't have another egg for the egg wash so I put about an 1/8 cup of milk and 2 T of butter in the dish that I had whipped the egg whites. Put the milk mixture in the microwave for 30 secs. Used this as my egg wash. First batch came out perfectly the second batch came out with a crusty crust like \"Au Petit Pan.\" Both were \"flawless \" according to husband and son. They want me to start making these every day we are in the US. I didn't find this any more labor intensive than any other bread or roll recipe on this site but I did use the bread machine.",
