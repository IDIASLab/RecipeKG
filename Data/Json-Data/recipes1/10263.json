I soaked the swordfish steaks in milk for about half an hour to remove the extra fishy taste then seared the steaks in a well-oiled hot cast iron skillet on both sides. I added all the other ingredients using golden raisins omitting the onion and substituted canned diced tomatoes with the juice and sunflower seeds for the pine nuts. Put the skillet in the oven and cooked about 8 minutes. Flipped the fish and topped them with the tomato mixture and cooked for about 10 minutes more. The tomato juice kept the fish moist and it cooked down completely. The result was unique and absolutely delicious.",
