It's salty and sweet with a nice basil finish. Will use more basil and some pressed garlic next time.  I skipped on using cream and it was still yummy.  Make sure you don't  over cook the yolk.  The yumminess of this dish depends on the consistency of a semi-oozy yolk.  Watch the video! Thx Chef John!",

It's so simple that you can only really go wrong if you overcook the dish or burn the toast! I just had it for my dinner and am wondering if it's too greedy to have more or if I even care about that! I did take mine out of the oven just before the yolks had set as the eggs carry on cooking in the heat of the ingredients. Perfect!",

I followed the directions and was sooo looking forward to a wonderful breakfast! After 10 mins. I checked the eggs to see if they were done. The whites didn't look set to me so I checked it again in 3 minutes. Then again. I decided that it was now or never! With great anticipation I set the toasts on a plate and brought our eggs to the table. Well as I tried to mix the yolks into the whites I saw that they were more solid than loose. But of course you already surmised that they would be right? (My next least favorite thing is semi-hard yolks). We did eat this creation but really never tasted egg just the sauce which was pretty good - but not what I expected! I believe that the dish I used because of the height did not allow the eggs to cook properly. Whatever the cause I don't think I'll try this one again. Chalk it up to user error!",

I sprayed my baking dish with non-stick cooking spray first and assembled as the recipe indicates. I ran into a problem trying to figure out if these were done. I thought they still looked too giggly after 12 minutes so I left them in the oven another 3 minutes. Big mistake. I should have taken them out at 12 minutes because after 3 more minutes the yolks were cooked through. They were still delicious and I d certainly make this again.
