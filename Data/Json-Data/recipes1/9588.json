Hubs agrees some of the best things I\u2019ve come up with are a result of AR\u2019s recipe search feature, typing in ingredients I need to use up.   I didn\u2019t measure anything, just cooked away, using olive oil rather than vegetable oil, large rather than small shrimp, and no cornstarch.  Also, in consideration of Hubs\u2019 sensitive innards, I skipped the optional red pepper flakes.   The fact I had homemade tomato sauce in the freezer made this particularly fresh tasting.  This, along with a tossed green salad, made for a delicious as well as pretty meal.",

I think using olive oil would solve that problem. It's healthier but still tasty. One thing. I think this recipe is more in small portion size. I tried to make for 4 but it was enough for 3. However if you tend to have small portion the recipe might be good. Two tips: 1) I replaced shrimp with chicken but I think it might be better to marinate and fry chicken before a little bit and 2) if you don't have cornstarch you can use normal flower to make it thick.",

I always make it exactly as written, using sunflower oil, sea salt, some \"Penzeys Freshly Ground Pepper\" and white onion. At first I tried larger shrimp, but then I thought that the 51-60 count shrimp worked better, so stuck with those. It is very tasty, a nice medley of ingredients. I will say that as written it's not very spicy (I like it hot!) and there's perhaps too much oil used. But all in all, I enjoyed this a lot, usually for three big dinners. I recommend it!",

We don't eat seafood so I substituted smoked sausage which I sauteed in the pan from the peppers and onions and added 8 minutes before the sauce was done. I think chicken would be great too or maybe andouille sausage. The only changes I'll make less time are less oil in the sauce (and maybe olive oil instead of vegetable) and a little more cornstarch to make it a little thicker.
