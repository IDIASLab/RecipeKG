However do remember to peak the egg whites to really stiff peaks (about 10 minutes to get to that stage) and if you try to make these on a very humid day the egg whites might not set up as well. Humidity tends to make the egg whites fall. Also cool the chocolate before adding it to the egg white mixture as the heat may make the egg whites fall while cooking.",
