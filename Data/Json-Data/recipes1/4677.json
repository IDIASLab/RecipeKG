I always begin my soups by cooking the onion and celery until the onion is transluscent, then add the meats and cook them, this draws out the good flavors and leaves little juicy bits in the pan,then the broth is added and the bits are scraped into the broth and other ingredients go in to simmer. I cut the recipe in half but used two stalks of celery including the leafy tops, and I toss a little (1 small clove) garlic or garlic powder and about a TB of parsley into all my soups.(I didn't use the thyme). Unless there is a reason to drastically cut ones fat intake I would recommend using whole milk or half skim and half cream to make a more creamy and palatable chowder. I prefer to use cornstarch to thicken soups, it's not so heavy and dissoves better.Also, I never add salt until the end if needed when using salty meat and broth. I debated about adding some cubed Velveeta,for a cheesy corn chowder,but decided not to this time.",

I also used whole milk instead of skim 1 can of corn instead of fresh corn and lots of potatoes. Added thyme parsley and rosemary with pepper and a bit of salt. Used cornstarch to thicken.

                "reviewBody": "I think this chowder has a lot going for it but needs some revisions. First of all sautee the chicken until it's browned and then save to add to the soup later. Sautee the onions and celery too to draw out their flavor before adding the other ingredients. Skim milk is fine if you're watching calories but be aware that it makes for a really REALLY thin soup -not really a chowder consistency. After trying to thicken it up at the end (and that being time consuming) I think next time I'll bake a roux while getting the rest of the ingredients ready and thicken it up that way like I do clam chowder. So bottom line is this: Sautee the veggies and chicken first thicken with a roux and add LOTS of salt and pepper. I think it might be worth five stars after that.",
