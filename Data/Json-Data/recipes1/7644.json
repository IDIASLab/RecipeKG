I creamed together the sour cream and cream cheese with a half a package of hot taco seasoning. Then I layered as instructed with medium chunky salsa green onions roman lettuce and cheddar cheese. I felt the hot taco seasoning and medium salsa made this dish not bland as other commented. You can always temper the seasonings to your taste with the salsa hot sauce and taco seasoning.
