Nothing like comfort food to warm the tummies of your loved ones. I couldn't find lamb stewing meat so I had no choice but to eliminate it. I added a little gravy master at the end for flavor only used beef stock; no water for the liquid and thickened this beautiful stew with some corn starch. Trust me friends no need to serve over noodles; this dish stands wonderfully alone. My hubby thanks you!!!!",

I only made a few slight changes: Instead of adding water which would have been too much liquid I added more beef broth. Also I cut the vinegar to just 1/2 cup. A whole bulb of garlic sounded like too much for me so I just used a few cloves. I didn't add the bread crumbs just cornstarch to thicken at the end. I also am not a fan of peas or parsnips so I used turnip instead. And as far as the meat I used 2 lbs of beef stew and 1 lb of pork stew meat. I am definately sending this recipe to friends. It's a keeper for sure! Thanks Anna!",
