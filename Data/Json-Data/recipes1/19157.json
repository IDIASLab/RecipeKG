I intended to put it in after mixing in the chocolate chips but it comes together pretty fast. It was delicious anyway I definitely agree that the 8x8 pan is the way to go. The first time I made this I used the nestle toll house chips I had on hand but the taste is definitely different. I used Hershey's milk chocolate chips on the second batch and that was more true to the classic s'mores taste. Thanks for contributing such a great recipe!",
