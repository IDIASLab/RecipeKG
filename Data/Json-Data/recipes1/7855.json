My family sampled the dip as originally described and mixed this evening and then offered suggestions in the process leaving most of the dip for me to eat. The consensus is that crab meat has a subtle flavor. Cocktail sauce hot sauce and horseradish sauce easily overwhelm the crab. The result is a spicy needlessly expensive cocktail sauce-flavored cream cheese dip. Celery could have substituted for the crab. Personally I would never think to spread cocktail sauce over crab meat. I won't again. I plan to revisit the crab dip concept starting with crab meat and cream cheese and then add subtle flavoring. If I find a workable result I'll post it.",
