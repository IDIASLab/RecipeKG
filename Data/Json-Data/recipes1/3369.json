The only reason I'm giving it four stars (not 5) is because I've made lots of additions based on other user recos. It's a great place to start. I use a total of 10 cups liquid - a couple cups water 1 c. wine and the rest chicken broth. I add 1 onion 4 cloves garlic 3-4 stalks of chopped celery 1 TBS. curry powder and a bay leaf to the broth for flavor. I also add lots of veggies. I add 1 cup each frozen corn and peas squash and yesterday I added sweet potato and butternut squash. The pearl barley makes it and absorbs a lot of water! It's very hearty and so healthy!",

I also cut the water back to 6 cups to keep it thicker.  I don't know if there's a difference between pearl barley and regular barley-but having used the regular before, I knew 1 cup was way too much-so I added only 1/4 of a cup.  Perfect flavor-even without onion or celery which I feel has to be the base for any soup/stew.  Very thick and yummy!",

Browned turkey in large pot with garlic, onion, fresh sage and thyme and Italian seasoning.  Added 2 of each: white potatoes, sweet potatoes, celery and carrots. Created broth by adding 5 C lo-sodium chicken stock, 2 C lo-sodium beef stock, 1 C white wine. Added 1 bag of shredded cabbage (white and red mix), 1 cup pearl barley. Brought to a boil, lowered heat, covered and simmered for 1 hour. Served with freshly grated parmesan cheese and crusty bread. Oh so good.",

It gave good flavor, but was WAY too salty for my taste.  It cooked really fast for me.  By the time the barley was cooked the veggies were over done.  It was still fantastic.
