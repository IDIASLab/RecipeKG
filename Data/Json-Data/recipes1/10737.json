I also used a deboned half leg of lamb which I cubed. I omitted the hot sauce (the extra chili did the trick.) I browned the meat removed then browned the onion garlic as instructed. I then combined the remaining ingredients in my crockpot and cooked for 4 hours on high (admittedly I stirred once but I m sure you don t need to.) I then left on warm for 2 hours to let the meat get more tender. This was excellent served over some plain couscous with a nice glass of red wine. I will admit this was even better the next day! Thanks for the recipe!",

I only use cinnamon sticks and added 2. I didn't use shanks...just pieces of lamb with bone in. Skipped the taking lamb back out of pan...just poured the sauce over the lamb and into the oven. I adjusted the baking time accordingly because I wasn't using those big shanks. Taste was wonderful and the spices blended nicely....loooove smokey flavor cumin gives dishes. I served this over couscous. Instead of peppers just threw in some spicey tunisian ground chili powder.",
