I sauteed some garlic and onions and some leftover canned tomatoes (basil and oregano flavored) about 1/4 cup then 1 can of spinach. I let that cool off. Then in another bowl I added 5 eggs the milk and some cheddar/jack cheese. I then greased a loaf pan mixed all the ingredients and baked it at 350 for about 40 min. It was gone in 10 minutes. It was so fluffy and delicious. I'll be making this recipe often. Don't be afraid to experiment.",
