Sliced the potatoes width wise cut the onion in half and sliced thinly. Place potato on foil put a piece of onion between each slice then a piece of cheese between each slice ( I used colby & sharp cheddar) then sprinkled with pepper and salt. I then took cream of mushroom soup and spooned in down the length of the potato poured 1/4 cup of milk over the potatoe and topped it with some slices of butter - Yes I know it is high caleries!! But it was wonderful comfort food and no leftovers. This made a nice cheese sauce to dip the potato slices in. Very tasty. If you are worried about sticking use pam on the foil first.",

Wow did this create an amazing smell and some delicious flavor.

Fingerling potatoes work just as well as potato slices.",
