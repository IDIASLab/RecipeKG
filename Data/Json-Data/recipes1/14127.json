Low-fat low-cal tastes great and FILLING! I added 4 whole cloves of garlic didn't peel anything (except the onions) and boiled it all together. Pureed the mixture added 2 Tbls. cilantro extra chili powder and juice from a whole lime. If you don't have chili paste use chili powder salt and vinegar (base ingredients to chili paste). This soup defined comfort food!! I will definently make it again! This would be a great starter for a Thanksgiving feast. Oh!! I also added 2 extra carrots!;0) Enjoy!!",
