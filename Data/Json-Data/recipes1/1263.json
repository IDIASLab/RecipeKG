I changed a few things just for my personal diet. I followed the advice of another reviewer and used two egg whites in place of two of the eggs. I eliminated totally one cup of the sugar and replaced one with brown sugar (i.e. 1 cup white, 1 cup brown) and the recipe was still sweet enough for me. I also, baked it in a bundt pan  for 55 minutes. After it cooled I inverted it onto a decorative plate and sifted a small amount of confectioner's sugar over the top, it was a huge hit and guest couldn't believe how low fat it was and still tasted great! Thanks for the recipe!",
