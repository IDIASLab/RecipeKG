I have made tuna casserole once before from a different recipe but didn't care for it. When I saw this one it seemed more suited to my tastes. I used twice as much macaroni same amount of tuna and cream of mushroom soup 3/4 lb. Velveeta instead of cheddar put directly into the mixture and topped it with shredded cheddar then put crushed Ritz crackers in butter on top. It was rich and fattening but so very good. Unlike the recipe I used before the tuna did not overpower everything else. I loved it and am looking forward to leftovers tonight!",
