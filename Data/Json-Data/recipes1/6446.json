I think next time I'll add more spices to jazz it up a bit more.

Rather than the tomatoes I used a jar of arrabbiata sauce which I cooked down with some sauteed onions a little sugar and another pinch of allspice. A sprinkling of mozzarella on top. The allspice and the slightly sweetened sauce give it more of an Arabic taste. Just a little change up. Love the bulgur as a base. Next time I think I'll go more Greek and use lemon and mint in the bulgur maybe some feta. Thanks for this twist on traditional moussaka!",
