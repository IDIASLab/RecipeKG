I didn't understand, I didn't think I added enough rice and maybe that would make it better.  I thought it was very sweet to, but I think the kids liked it better because of that.  It was much better cold and much creamer.  Really the tast wasn't bad and it was low in fat.  OK I made this again and it turned out GREAT it was creamy and wonderful I think what happened is that I added like almost twice the rice it was so good I changed my rateing.",

I thought this would avoid the \"scrambled eggs\" in the pudding. I followed the recipe exactly but halved it and baked in an 8X8 dish. The resulting dessert took 90 minutes to bake and I wouldn't really call it pudding. I wouldn't call it custard either. I stirred this several times while it was baking (also thinking this would cut down on scrambled eggs). When I finally did remove it from the oven it was covered with a layer of grease. I had to blot this with a paper towel. After sitting the mixture did firm up a bit. The rice took on a brown tint from the raisins and it was full of little bits of - yup - scrambled egg. This was extremely sweet so I would recommend cutting the sugar by half. I think I will go back to stove-top rice pudding. I don't know that it's just this recipe - I think I just prefer the creamy texture of stove-top. Thanks for the recipe.",
