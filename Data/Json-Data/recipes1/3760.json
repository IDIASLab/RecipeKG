Here's the trick to give it more flavor: first, make the stew the night before, as it will intensify greatly over night.  Secondly, most restaurants add half a bottle or so of clam juice to their stew.  This really brings out the lobster flavor.  Again, this is a great base for classic lobster stew.... coming from a MAINER (born and raised).",
