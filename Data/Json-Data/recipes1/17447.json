The ingredient amounts are good but I added some extra pesto when it was all said and done because I love the stuff. The Quorn is a good substitute but I still try not to eat it very often since it was created in a lab and I really don't know exactly what its made of (Google it for more info). If you're not used to vegetarian type substitutes like Quorn make sure you cook it long enough. Make sure it's browned. Most things like this taste better when you cook it fully or slightly over-cook it which is why I am guessing someone gave this a 1 star. My non-vegetarian friend loved it.",

Can't have dairy so I subbed oil for butter and I made a homemade pesto with just basil and parsley with a bit of water in my blender. To make it go faster and use fewer pans I browned the onions and Quorn and then added broth pesto peas and pasta. Then covered until pasta was soft uncovered until water was pretty much gone. It was really good. My 7yo was just 'eh' about the Quorn but she ate one serving anyway and then got more peas and pasta my 4yo loved all of it (and he is the picky one) my 11 month old only dropped some pasta on the ground but ate all the peas and Quorn. I think the would be really good with the parmesan. Will defiantly add this to our meal rotation.",
