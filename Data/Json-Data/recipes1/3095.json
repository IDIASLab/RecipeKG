This was the closest I could find. It did pretty well; getting all the softened yeast off the bottom of the bowl to dump it into the dough mixture is tricky. It might be better to dump the rest onto the yeast since missing some yeast can be a big problem. If you can plan the time this is a nice and simple treat...but it's not my favorite.",
