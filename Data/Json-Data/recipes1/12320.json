Instead of throwing away the marinade, however, I boiled it (to kill the raw-pork germs) and then used it to baste the tenderloin while grilling. My tenderloin took about 40 minutes to cook over indirect heat, and I turned it every 10 minutes and basted. The results was was very tender meat with a fantastic glaze. Yum!",

The ONLY change I added for us was 1/4 tsp minced garlic and a dash of cayenne to add a bit of heat, and I mean very little heat. Marinated in a ziplock bag 4 hours; boiled the marinade while the tenderloin was in the oven, then poured that syrup-thickness sauce over top and finished. Total cooking time 1 hour at 400 and it was a perfect 145 degrees at exactly an hour. Roasted red potatoes and onions (paprika, garlic, Olive oil) alongside; served with the greatest baby carrots (Dijon Glazed Carrots from this site--those are simply wonderful). It was one of the best meals ever. Husband quote: \"I have honestly never, ever had pork this good before\". THANKS for the recipe ! We'll be keeping for sure.",
