And I used mini bow tie pasta and cooked it separately. This was a nice vegetable soup and easy to throw together. One can of kidney beans seemed a little sparse so next time I ll add a second can. UPDATE 1/17/14: I made this again as follows: I used chicken broth and chicken bouillon as before the tomatoes 1 cup each of carrots celery and pearl onions no green beans macaroni or beans. I used two zucchini and one yellow summer squash. Great flavor and really low in calories!",
