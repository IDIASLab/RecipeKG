This was exactly what I was after and what I thought we really needed but I must say I never expected to enjoy it as much as I did. Truth be told if health and poundage weren't issues I'd much prefer gut bombs - I'm not a big fan of \"cold and crunchy\" as a rule nor does the idea of fruit in my salad particularly with meat appeal to me. But I was willing to give it a try - for the sake of doing our bodies good. Surprise! We liked it! What a perfectly compatible array of ingredients! Not only was this light healthy and refreshing it was delicious something I'd expect from an upscale restaurant here in SW Florida. I made no changes except to use Romaine and to add some cucumber which fit in with this salad well. I was tempted to omit the basil and I'm glad I didn't - it was surprisingly good with the pineapple and shrimp. As for the fruit/savory combo at least given this salad anyway I am a convert.",
