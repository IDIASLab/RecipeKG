My old family recipe calls for a 325 degree oven and bake for 18-20 minutes. They are light and creamy - dreamy too! I've actually made some with walnuts as my husband isn't too excited about pecans. Both are great - pecans just a little bit better in my opinion. I roll in powdered sugar when they first come out of the oven and then after they've cooled I sprinkle with more powdered sugar.
