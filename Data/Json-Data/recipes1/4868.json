Yum.\nThanks for a simple and delicious recipe.  It's now one of my favorites and will be keeper.\n",

I opted to use some leftover citrus grilled chicken I had on hand. I also used some red grapes for a little color. I didn't have cucumber salad dressing so I used Hellman's light mayo cut with a bit of sour cream and added a bit of salt, pepper and just a bit of curry powder. Overall, very good on toasted whole grain bread.",

There was also a salty taste and I don't know if that came from the nuts or from using canned chicken. I've never used it before. I was trying to duplicate a recipe that I lost several years ago and this was close. My kids and husband loved it. I was disappointed but maybe just because I was expecting my \"old\" recipe.
