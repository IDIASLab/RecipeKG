Mom has loads of frozen rhubarb in her freezer from last summer that needs to be used up so I thought I'd put a dent in it with this recipe. Wow, was it ever a hit...even with non rhubarb lovers!!  One thing I would suggest though concerns the method of making the \"custard\".  Instead of mixing the egg yolks with the flour, mix them first with the sugar, than the milk, than beat in the flour. If you mix the ingredients in the order described in the method you will end up with hard little pieces of egg/flour, making your custard mixture grainy.Just thought I'd offer a hint!! To all of you who have a rhubarb patch and are always on the hunt for new rhubarb recipes...you've just gotta try this one!!! Thanks a bunch Patty!",

However, I didn't let the crust cool before topping with the filling mixture (just put it on right after taking crust out of the oven & popped it back in the oven); and, although the recipe doesn't specify, you should always put a meringue on top of the filling when it's hot and spread it til it touches the sides of the pan to prevent it from \"shrinking\" while cooling.",

I ground two tablespoons of flax seeds in my coffee grinder and added them to the crust mixture for a wonderful nutty flavour (and a bit of added fiber..sneaky nutrition).  Other than that, I made no other tweaks.  The custard was firm enough to slice but velvety soft in the mouth.  The meringue was a nice touch and looked very pretty (make sure filling is hot when you spread on egg white mixture..helps avoid making custard wet).  And the preparation in a 9x13 dish served a lot of people with little trouble.  Best the day it is made (crust got a bit soggy overnight).  I will definitely make again when I need a dessert for a crowd!",

I can't tell you all the mishaps I had making this. First I didn't realize how much 8 cups of rhubarb was so I had to keep sending my son up and down the garden to get more. Then I have a fan assisted oven and thought I overbaked it at every stage. I honestly wasn't going to bring it. To top it all off it fell over in the car on the way there. I begged my sis in law not to serve it until someone brave tasted it but there it was on the dessert table next to all the fancy tarts and chocolates. Do you know everyone was bugging me for the recipe?! I think any dessert that can take that much abuse and still taste so good deserves 5 stars!",
