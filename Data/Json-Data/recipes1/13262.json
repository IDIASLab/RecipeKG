I used a seasoning blend by Pictsweet that has chopped onions green and red bell peppers celery and garlic salt. I sauteed this blend in a little butter while cutting up the squash. I added the squash and water to the sauteed veggies and cooked together for 15 minutes. I substituted cream of celery for the cream of mushroom and added a little cajun seasoning (Tony Chachere's). The casserole came out beautiful and tasted awesome.",

I lightened it considerably by using Egg Beaters instead of eggs reducing the cheese to 1 cup (and using 2% milk cheddar cheese) and using just 1/2 cup bread crumbs instead of the croutons. I also found I was out of mushroom soup....I used 98% fat free Broccoli Cheese soup instead and it was fabulous!! Definately a keeper!",
