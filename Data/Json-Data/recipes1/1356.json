I do not consider this a dessert bread since it is not very sweet.  I found it a tad dry.  I also took my bread out of the oven at 55 minutes and it was a little overdone on the edges.  Definitely check your bread loaf for doneness frequently after 45 minutes.  I added sunflower seeds and chopped walnuts and that was very good.",
