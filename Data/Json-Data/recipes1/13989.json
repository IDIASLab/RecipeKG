Quickly stir in a half to three-quarters of a cup of caramel/chocolate mixed chips (otherwise they will melt) spread the mixture out evenly in the dish then immediately put it in the refrigerator uncovered for a few hours to harden.",

I will probably speed things a little more by melting or softening the butter first in the microwave since that's the main hurdle to getting the mixture melted and smooth.",
