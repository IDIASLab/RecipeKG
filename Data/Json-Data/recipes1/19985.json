I didn't bother to ask him why he didn't care for it because I knew the answer after eating it myself. In a nutshell it was just too rich - too much mayo too much cheese. And without the additions I made of fresh minced garlic and Penzey's Fox Point Seasoning I suspect this would have been a little wimpy flavor-wise too. Something this rich might be good as a dip (think Artichoke-Spinach Dip) but it's just too rich as a side dish.",
