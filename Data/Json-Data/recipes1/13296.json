In this case however I kept some of the reviews and my prior experience making this type of simple fudge in mind before proceeding as I was concerned about wasting ingredients. The typical ratio of chips to milk with this type of fudge is 2.5 cups chips to 14 ounces of milk. That's what I have always used and it's always worked out for me. I just could not see this setting up as written and many of the reviews confirmed that therefore I used 2.5 cups chips. The end result was a firm but creamy textured fudge. I also chose dried tart cherries instead of candied for more of a sweet/tart contrast and next time I would add a touch more almond extract.",
