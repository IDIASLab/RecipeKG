I only cooked the beans for 6 minutes, since 7 to 8 seemed to long. Next time I would go with 4 or 5 so as to not overcook them. I like them al dente and if you overcook them, they get a muddy green color. I agree with the other reviewer that this would have been easier to eat had the beans been cut into smaller pieces. I didn't really get the point of adding the balsamic and garlic salt two separate  times. It's much easier to just mix up the dressing and toss altogether at the end.",

Next time I\u2019ll add it. To keep your green beans brilliant green, boil them in 2 quarts of water and 1/4 cup salt for exactly 7 minutes. Drain. Dump them immediately into ice water. Instead of garlic salt use plain garlic powder. Your beans will NOT be salty, but they will keep their beautiful green color.",
