The Keebler grasshopper cookie had a much better taste and was more realistic looking with its uneven edges and thinner patty. I glued the cookies on with a dab of melted chocolate, placed in the center of the meat. I painted spots on the top bun with Lyle's Golden Syrup and dipped in the seeds. Piped yellow and red frosting just around the underside edge of the top bun. Placed green coconut on the meat and applied light pressure when placing the top bun on. This caused the frosting to ooze out just enough to look like ketchup and melted cheese. Easy, fun and taste good too. ",

Some reviewers say they don't taste all that great, but I disagree- and I'm not even a big peppermint patty fan.  My 3-year old son helped make these (he unwrapped all the candy).  We made them for us, and my 5-year old daughter as an after school snack.  They're all gone now- should have doubled the recipe!  My daughter wants me to make them for her class.  My husband wants me to make them for his work!  What a fun recipe.  Oh, I used a dab of honey on the inside of the buns, to help it stick.  I found that just using water to make the sesame seeds stick didn't work very well, so I plopped some corn syrup into the water, and used that.  It worked very, very well.  (I didn't totally stir it together, but dragged my paintbrush through it).  I love this recipe, and will definitely make it again!",

People just want to look at it but I had some friends tell me they loved the taste and wanted to eat more.:) I made cheese and lettuce out of rolled fondant. I bought some american cheese to match the color using orange & yellow paste colors rolled out the fondant and cut it with a pizza cutter into squares. The lettuce was obviously green and I just pinched off little pieces so it had rough edges - very cute! You really don't need much to do a couple dozen cookies. I gave them out at work in a french fry bag that said \"a smile for your friday\" - because it was Friday - afterwards my husband said it should have said FrYday. From the bottom: Waffer yellow icing mint patty red icing tiny \"lettuce\" tiny \"cheese\" a smidge more red icing if needed top waffer honey sesame seeds. Wrap in wax paper.",

Every kids wnated to get a piece of the action in making them. My daughter is taking them to school tomorrow for her birthday party. We used other suggestions and wrapped them in tin foil to get the fast food effect. I bought the frosting in a can- ready to squirt. It really made putting on the \"mustard\" and \"ketsup\" a snap. I had some white frsting the I put on the wafers (the bottom \"bun\") for glue to hold on the patty. I used York peppermint patties for the patty. We used a honey/ water mixture for the glue to hold on the sesame seeds. I highly suggest you brush on honey mix on the top bun BEFORE you put in on the rest of the hamburger. I got excited about seeing the finished product and put the top bun on and we had a hard time getting the honey on it w/ out the cookies spinning in circles. I used 1 box of wafers and 1 bag of patties and it made 41 cookies. Now the rest of my kids can't wait to take them for their birthday parties next year. Really quite easy and fast to put together. We put all 41 together in about 15 minutes with 3 of us working. Would be fun for a bake sale!",
