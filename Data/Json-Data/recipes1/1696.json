There is surprisingly little liquid in the original recipe, which is probably why people found it dry. My changes did make it moist, but this cake has a very fine crumb which makes it fall apart easily. I think next time I will add some instant chocolate pudding to deepend the chocolate flavor and see if it helps the crumbs hold together.\r\nThe flavor was great and I frosted it with chocolate cream cheese frosting for Valentines Day. I will use this recipe again, but continue to tweek it until I get exactly what I want. A great start though, thanks Sally!",

I add 1 tsp of instant coffee granules to really help the flavor develop further.   Due to the variance in sourdough starters, it is best to use the 1 3/4 cups of flour as a guideline; add the full amount if your starter is more liquid than solid, and less otherwise. You should aim for a batter that is like slightly thin pancake batter for this cake. I serve it to my family as is, but it is very tasty sprinkled with powdered sugar. It comes out very pretty if baked in a bundt pan, which takes approximately 50 minutes to bake.",
