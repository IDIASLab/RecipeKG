I uncharacteristically did not read any of the reviews because I was pressed for time but I must admit to the following modifications (which I highly recommend). Used only 1/4 of a large sweet onion added 2 T smooth peanut butter and 2 T water (coconut milk would be even better if you had some already opened). Do not recommend heating the cucumber and mint (personal choice) add shredded carrot and chopped cilantro on top of the lettuce before wrapping it up. Serve it with the sauce in the recipe or seasoned rice vinegar (we found we especially like it with seasoned rice vinegar). Super!",
