        "description": "Having worked in two donut shops in Massachusetts, I now know the reason why filled donuts are often referred to as \"creme\" filled is because the closest they've come to real cream is what's in the coffee they're eaten with.  Fillings made with real cream are highly perishable and have the potential for causing food poisoning.  In a nice restaurant where desserts are made-to-order, you would probably get a real cream filling, but not in a donut shop or run-of-the-mill bakery, especially a chain.  This is what we put in the \"cream\" filled donuts, and people just raved about them.",

I beat this filling for about 15 minutes on the highest setting and scraped down the bowl every few minutes or so, it still came out gritty. It is impossible to get this smooth and gritty free doing this method, think of raw cookie dough but only with more grit. When I realized that this was as good as it was gonna get, I did go ahead and add more powder sugar and some flavorings which made it taste better, but it still was not enjoyable. I suggest if you want to use this recipe to use powder sugar instead of regular sugar and add some vanilla extra. ",

I, too, added 1 tsp vanilla and filled a three layer dark chocolate cake (box mix) with this luscious filling and covered the cake with dark chocolate frosting (store bought).  This cake looked beautiful when cut and tasted even better. It disappeared!  There were no leftovers.  This recipe is not at all time consuming, it is the easiest filling I've ever made.  Just be sure to sift the confectioners sugar so that there are no little lumps and whip until all the sugar is completely melted into the shortening so that it is not all grainy.  Great recipe, Karen!",
