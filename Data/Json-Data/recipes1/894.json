We always make him oatmeal raisin cookies and he always complains that there aren't enough raisins (even when there are so many the cookies barely stay together!) I joked that I finally found a way to extract the essence of raisin (the boiling really does this!) and bake it throughout the cake. Boiling the raisins also makes sure the cake stays nice and moist. I substituted 1/4 of spiced rum for 1/4 of water in the baking and it turned out delicious. Great recipe if you love raisins!",
