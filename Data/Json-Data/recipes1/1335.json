However, instead of putting it in a pan, next time I'm going to make drop cookies out of it, using a small ice cream scoop and putting on a waxed paper lined platter. My family didn't think it would taste good because it looks dreadful when done, but it went over great. It made two loaf pans full. I was able to send some home to guests. Some of my family doesn't like fruitcake, but they liked this recipe. Only a tiny bit is now left for my husband to enjoy. I, alas, have diabetes and can't eat this. It is best to let this sit in refrigerator overnight for more flavor.",
