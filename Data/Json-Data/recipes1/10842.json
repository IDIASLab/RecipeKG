Don't be scared off by the strange combination of ingredients -- this is a hearty vegetarian meal with great flavor and texture! I modified this recipe by only using one half of one onion (just seemed like too much otherwise). In addition I used about half of a can of diced tomatoes since I wanted the sauce to be thicker. I used a little cheese and since my family doesn't like peppers I omitted them and used diced avocado as a garnish for color and flavor. Definitely will make again!",

I ommitted the olives used extra salsa (fresh \"Mi Abuelo brand from the refrigerated section of Sam's Club--excellent!) and farfalle (bowtie) pasta. I then topped it with melted colby/jack and sour cream mixed it all together and reheated it to make a warm creamy sauce. Top it off with crumbled blue corn chips and you'll be in comfort-food heaven!!! It was so good that I made it again as soon it was gone!!! Tip: I didn't like the McCormick taco seasoning as well as other brands. The Taco Bell brand was amazing!!!",

I think some seasoned grilled chicken strips could add a nice touch as well..or even some shredded cheddar cheese. Thanks Mimi.",
