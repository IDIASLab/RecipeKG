The only difference is that I use 1 (12 oz) can of evaporated milk. (I don't like odd amounts left over and I've never felt that it affected the outcome.) The real key to success is to always use a candy thermometer and to always check the boiling point of water at the time you make the fudge. It varies each time. For example: Boiling point is 212 degree F. Today it was 8 degrees lower. That meant I needed to stop cooking the fudge at 228 degrees rather than at 236 degrees (soft ball stage). Therefore it is critical that you always boil some water and check the boiling point before making candy.",
