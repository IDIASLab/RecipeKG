But using the advice of other reviewers to spice things up this turned out to be a spectacular weekday dish. I cooked my chicken fully in a small amount of water (instead of oil). I then tossed my cooked chicken breasts in the fridge overnight with 2 cloves of chopped garlic tossed on top (not mixed in). The next afternoon the rest of the recipe was cake. I tossed the garlic from on top of the chicken 1/4 of a chopped onion 1 tsp of basil and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes into a pan with a 1/4 tsp of margarine and sauteed it all. I then added the mushroom soup and water mixed it up and followed the rest of the recipe as written. After adding the chicken I mixed in 1 tbsp of freshly chopped parsley to the sauce and let it simmer for 6 minutes. I served it over rice (made in the 6 minutes that the sauce simmered). When cooking the dish I thought there was way too much sauce but it turned out to be the perfect amount with rice. S.O. loved it. Definitely a keeper.",

It STILL came out bland so I can't imagine the flavor without these seasonings! All I had in the pantry was Healthy Request cream of mushroom so that may have contributed to the lack of flavor. If I ever make this again I'll definitely use the regular cream of mushroom soup. I'd also suggest using chicken broth instead of the 1/2 cup of water to add more flavor. It was really easy though I just think this \"2-step chicken\" needs a few more steps.",
