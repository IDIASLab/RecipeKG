I added 1/2 cup of milk, 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, a bit of mrs. dash, and 1 tablespoon of curry. Then after it cooked on low for 5-6 hours I added a bag of frozen veggies (broccoli, califlower, & carrots). I let it cook for another 1/2 hour on low and it was fabulous. We had it over rice.

I followed the recipe but added Italian seasoning parsley Mrs. Dash and a handful or two of cheddar cheese. The dumplings I did was my mothers recipe for 4/5 drop dumplings I did 1 cup flour 1tsp baking soda dash salt dash sugar and enough water to make it sticky. Dropped them in the crock pot 30-45 minutes before dinner. right before we ate I topped with a little more cheese. It was creamy and smelled SO good. Made this way my husband LOVED it and he's not a big fan of dumplings. Growing up with this dish I would have to say this was one of the best recipes and it's REALLY easy!",
