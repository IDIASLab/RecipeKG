Although they were great this is by far the best recipe. Soft cookies perfect mild almond flavor! Don't change a thing in this recipe. The only thing I don't do as far as the chocolate is cover the top completely but rather cut the cookies into long strips first use a drizzler with melted chocolate in it and drizzle it along the tops and let it fall down the sides and then cut them into the smaller one inch cookies. It can be messy and hard to cut nicely with the chocolate covering the top once it hardens (it cracks).",

The last time I made them I accidentally bought almond filling instead of almond paste and they turned out delicious as usual. I used 12 oz of almond filling and added more almond extract to increase the almond flavoring. Another change I made was to add some milk and oil to the chocolate while I was melting it. I just use my small Pampered Chef micro-cooker and melt the chocolate in the microwave. With the addition of the milk the top layer of chocolate cuts a lot easier and doesn't break. One last thing I always line my pans with parchment paper to make it easier to remove the layers from the pans.",

Do realize if you come across a rather doughy light and fluffy batter you are on the right track and this is correct Have patience when making these cookies. My only regret with this recipe is that I was rushing. My top layer broke but not to worry I used the melted chocolate to cover up the cracks. I also recommend Apricot Jam and the recipe calls for one jar...do not use one jar of jam; Use a half a jar jam to avoid jelly oozing out of the cookies. As well as the chocolate use it sparingly to avoid a thick clumpy mess. And most importantly allow your cakes to cool down. Or else you will have a broken layer cake like what happened to me!! One extra tip...When your finished applying the layers the chocolate ect...Before placing into refrigerator for cooling...place a sheet of foil on top of cake...and take a heavy pan to give the layer cakes some pressure...You could also use a brick from outside of the house and wrap it up in a plastic bag of course ensure the brick is rinsed off..this pressure will give your cookies a professional look and compressed the layers as seen in the photo above. Bon appetite!",
