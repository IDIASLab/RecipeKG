I am an experienced pasta maker, using various machines, rollers etc. This is by far the easiest to handle and has an excellent flavor.  I used a kitchen-aid to mix the dough, but did the final kneading by hand.  I doubled it the first time I used it.  I added 1 tablespoon of olive oil in place of some of the water as well.  After kneading, I covered it in plastic wrap and let it rest for about 15 minutes.  Awesome performance in the rollers, and cutters and a better recipe than the Kitchen-Aid manual which I have always found to be too dry no matter what I do.  This is awesome and now my go to recipe.",

Most doughs need to rest after being worked so that they will roll out easier and this dough definitely benefitted from resting (to let the gluten relax). \n\nI doubled the recipe to \"play around\" and cut fettucine sized strips as well as 1\" wide strips. I also cut some wider and tried my hand at a few herb-seasoned ricotta-filled ravioli and then cut some wider still and used that same filling to make some free-form lasagnes. Everything boiled up wonderfully... tender and delicate! Yum! Can't wait to try some of the noodles/pasta in some homemade turkey soup after Thanksgiving!\n\nAll I can say, after my first attempt at homemade pasta is you gotta try it! And you DON'T need a pasta machine either! Keep your rolling pin and work surface well-floured, keep a pastry brush handy to brush excess flour off the rolled dough, and keep a stainless steel dough scraper handy just in case you do get a bit of adhering to the work surface.",

                "reviewBody": "I've always heard that there's nothing like fresh pasta, I was VERY pleasantly surprised at how true this was:-)It was fun and felt great making fresh pasta. I felt like one of those professional cooks in a fine restaurant:-)I'm glad I read the other reviewer's tips. I let the dough rest about 45 min. Could've let 30 min., but was busy. I think the extra time resting before rolling made dough more easy to work with. I had no trouble working with it. You don't really need a pasta machine unless you want to make spaghetti or some other pasta, etc. This was great for me since I don't have one, but want to defenately buy one now. I have very limited space to work with, my counter is about the width of a regular stovetop, maybe(sp?) smaller. What I would recommend if you have a small workspace is that when you have let the dough rest, whatever amount of servings you are making, divide the dough into that many parts, and work one at a time. Actually think takes less time this way. Another tip: If rolling, to keep even thickness, don't double roll,etc over one part of the dough then continue on to next part,etc. Roll one way one time over whole piece of dough. If dough creates a roll, simply pick up dough and lay back down and continue. I let the dough dry by leaving it spread on the counter. I used a pizza cutter to cut dough. I will make this again.",

I used the kitchenaide dough attachment to mix it. Then let it sit for 45 minutes. I had wrapped it in wax paper and it stuck to the paper! Scraped it off and rolled it out on the floured kitchen table. After that I realized I should have rolled it on a cutting board so I picked it up and moved it. Once on the cutting board I used a pizza cutter to make long thin slices. Pizza cutter worked very well - i had various sizes due to not caring about consistency. (My husband said he liked the thinner ones better.) Then I laid them all out on a floured dinner plate and covered it with wax paper until it was time to cook (2 hours later). I should have kept the pieces more separated as some of them got stuck together. Next time I'll leave them on the cutting board but spread them out more and let them dry that way. It was easy to make with just a rolling pin. We're going to use this recipe as a base to make homemade ravioli next!",
