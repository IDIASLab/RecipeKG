In fact Andes Mints makes their own mint baking chips - which I used and highly recommend (found next to the toffee bits and M&M's in your grocery store). I don't think you need 2c of them though - somewhere between 1 to 1 1/2 cup should be fine (start w/ one cup and add more to taste and texture). However I did use the full two cups and found these cookies extremely minty which doesn't make them bad...I'll just cut back next time. However when I pulled them out of the oven these cookies had a uncooked (whitish/green tint) look to them. I was worried...who would eat these? They don't even look cooked. Then I got an idea I used on another cookie - I melted some chocolate almond bark (just a couple sqaures of it) and with my spoon lightly drizzled chocolate criss-crossing over the top. Not only did they look fabulous but tasted great. Any true choc. mint lover can appreciate these cookies. Even my boyfriend who isn't so fond of chocolate mint had his share over the holidays. I'll make these again and again...using my changes or additions. Thanks a ton Clare!",

I had never made cookies with oil before and was a bit skeptical especially because the batter seemed kind of liquid when it was all together. I chilled it for a little while and then baked for 10 minutes. I agree with the previous reviewer who felt these were very light. Mine were perfectly done and they were very light. I did not dust them with sugar before baking it's the only thing I changed about the recipe. I absolutely loved these and they will be added to my recipe box permanently.

The dough tasted a little boring but I figured that was just me being used to butter taste. I ended up having to bake these for almost twenty minutes to get them to a \"done\" apppearance and taste. They didn't make a cookie shape at all just stayed how I baked them. Even with a sugar coating these cookies tasted like boring bread with random chocolate chips. As another review said it was like the dough was a holder for the chips. I will not be making this recipe again.",
