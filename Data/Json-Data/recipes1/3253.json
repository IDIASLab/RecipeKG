I had a couple of problems with the dough rising and being too large for the baking pan which caused my cinnamon sugar topping to run off of the top and onto the bottom of the oven. Ooops. I think a little bit of cinnamon in the cake itself would be a great addition but overall it was a great recipe. Thanks Janice!",
