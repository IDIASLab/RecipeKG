If you bite into these you can see the actual layers in the cookie...simply and simply delicious. Perfect with that afternoon cup of tea. If a slighter sweetened variation is wanted try sprinkling a little sugar on the top of the cookies before baking. The bubbles on top of the cookie just lend to it's appeal this recipe isn't meant to be flat and square like a bar type cookie. Enjoy!!! Thanks for a fabulous addition.",

I will use salted butter if they need to stand by themselves but I almost always top them with something. Mmm try lemon curd it's lovely. I like to roll them out thick as much as 3/8\" to simulate those beautiful artificial storebought cookies that my kids beg for. This is a delicious understated cookie that pairs well with anything. I'm not completely sure but I think that the rice flour adds delicacy to the cookie. I have made them with 2 1/3 c wheat flour and they don't seem quite as tender.",
