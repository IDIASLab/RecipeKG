I did press all the water out of the spinach, but then mixed the spinach into the cream cheese mixture with a spoon until all the spinach was coated and mixed with it. Then I put it in the casserole dish. I also increased the Parmesan cheese to 1/2 cup instead of 1/3rd, and used block parmesan cheese and grated it myself. This was delicious! Even the Firefighters at my husbands work loved it. 2 thumbs up!",

Make sure you use real cream cheese or 1/3 fat Neufchatel cheese. I made the mistake of using garlic and herb whipped \"cream cheese\" since so many reviews suggested adding onion and garlic. I thought I was being so smart LOL. But it just doesn't taste the same. All that whipped milk and whey protien doesn't have the bite that real cream cheese has. It's much better to use the real thing and add your own spices.",

First I sauteed half and onion in real butter with about 2 tablespoons of bacon bits then added the spinach and about a clove of minced garlic and cooked it for a few minutes. Then I added the cream cheese and milk and cooked until the cream cheese was melted and mixed in. Then I put it in the casserole dish and topped it with the paremesan cheese. I put it in the fridge until till dinner then just popped it in the oven. It was soo good. Thanks for sharing! I will be making this again!",
