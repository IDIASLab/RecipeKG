Instead of adding lemon juice, I used   2-1/2 tablespoons of frozen lemonade concentrate and I think it is lemony enough.  I also used 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract instead of the vanilla extract and I added a couple more tablespoons of flour.  Then I chilled my dough for about 45 minutes before baking.  If you want the cookies to be fancy looking, you can roll the dough into 1 inch balls;  then flatten the balls to about 1/4 inch thick using the bottom of a glass that has been moistened and dipped in granulated sugar.  Lastly, used almond slices that are not broken and arrange three almond slices like spokes on a wheel and press them in slightly.  This makes them look elegant.  Oh, and I also chilled the cookies for about 10 minutes right before putting them in the oven.  That part may not be necessary, but I thought it would keep them from flattening out too much.  I only baked mine for 8 minutes.",

Then one day I thought why not and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup added 1/2 cup chopped cranberries 1 tsp lime juice upped the baking powder to 1 tsp and baking soda to 1/2 tsp. I baked them in tiny paper cups for 17 mins. They tasted very very good. To pass the acid test I made these lemony cupcakes for tea with a bunch of discerning ladies but this time I topped them with cream cheese and a frosted cranberry which I also got from AllRecipes. Those baby cupcakes looked so pretty! My goodness the ladies were fighting over the last few cakes. But they were all my good friends so we had a really good time with me handing out the recipe like favours!",
