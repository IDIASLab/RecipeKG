I took the suggestions of others;  it tasted really good and my husband really liked it- and he is really picky about how food tastes.  I cooked the turkey sausage and onions in a pan then put them in the crock pot; I added the following: garlic, cannellini beans, petite diced tomatoes, sweet turkey sausage (I would use spicy instead of sweet next time),fresh grated parmesan cheese which I added at the beginning of cooking and some when I served it.  I think it would have tasted just as good without the half and half or evaporated milk.  Also be sure to put the spinach in in the last half hour-I put mine in with the rest of the ingredients and the spinach was a little mushy.",

Oh, by the way, since sausage links are sold mostly in packages of 5, just throw them all in and use 8 cups of broth instead of 6.  It works.",

Saute it in a stock pot (Le Creuset dutch oven pots work great for this dish) and then add the rest of the ingredients in the same pot.  Also, I don't use any milk or cream and it makes a ice \"brothy\" soup.   \r\n\r\nI have made this many times and it always comes out great.  You can vary the amount of any of the ingredients to your taste and it still tastes terrific.  For a change of pace, substitute 2 cups of cooked rice into the soup instead of the potatoes.  I like to use a mix of white and wild rice when I do this, but any rice would work well.  Thanks for a great-tasting, quick, and easy recipe!!!",

Based on other reviewers suggestions, I used spicy turkey sausage instead of pork to save on calories and fat.  I personally didn't feel it affected the taste at all, but my husband would have liked to try it with the \"real sausage\".  I drained my sausage well after browning.  I added some minced garlic in when I browned the sausage.  I took the sausage/garlic and put it in my crockpot along with a package of Simply Potatoes diced potatoes with onions, the broth and a can of petite diced tomatoes.  After it cooked for a few hours on high, I added in a can of drained cannellini beans and a package of baby spinach.   I let that cook for another hour or so and then added in half and half instead of the evaporated milk just before serving.  I think I will let the potatoes cook a little longer in the crockpot next time.  They were not quite as tender as I would prefer, but overall, I was very impressed with this dish.  I am planning to take it to a soup and salad social that I am attending next week!",

Starting with this recipe I was able to convince my wife that spinach, when prepared well, can be quite exquisite. My father continues to dislike spinach; but he craves this recipe...so I always have to make large batches to share with my mother and father.   It freezes very well, by the way. The original recipes calls for odd measurements such as \"three Italian sausages\" and \"1/4 cup of evaporated milk.\" Sausages aren't normally sold in thrice, and what do you do with the other portion of the evaporated milk can once you've measured out the measly 1/4 cup? Therefore, it helps to bump-up the serving size to fit the number of sausages commonly sold in a package (5 or 7, depending); I've also noticed that it only enriches the taste of the soup if you use a whole can of evaporated milk, too.  All in all, a fantastic recipe to use again and again.",
