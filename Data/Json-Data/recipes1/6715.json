I added a little chopped celery first then since I couldn't find any heavy cream at the store I substituted 1 half pint of whipping cream and then split amount of milk in half and used sour cream to make up the other half. And added extra cheddar cheese. Not so much like a potato salad as a potato cassarole...but very yummy anyway.",
