If still too thick, add a little bit of water.  Do this or else the chicken will be swimming in butter when it's done.  I do add 1/2 and 1/2 coarse ground mustard and Dijon.  The mustard seeds add great flavor and texture.  I've also made with boneless thighs, with and without skins.  If using skin-on chicken, broil on high for the first 5-7 min. to brown/caramelize the skin, then lower heat to regular cooking temp for the remaining cooking time.  This is when I loosely cover with foil to keep the chicken moist.  Put the extra marinade right in with the chicke when baking because it makes a wonderful sauce over rice.  Kid friendly flavors yet elegant enought for company.  When I do have comapany, I grill this for more intense flavor and color.  Also try this marinade with (grilled or baked Pork Tenderloin - SUPERB.",

I also doubled the amount of curry.\r\nTo make this a more balanced, healthful meal, I experimented and added 1/2 package of frozen stir fry vegetables (found in the freezer section of my local grocer), and added them to the chicken while it marinated.\r\nTo ensure that the vegetables remain tender but the chicken completely cooks, make sure to cover the pan during the initial 10-15 minutes of cooking at 375 degrees and then uncover and reduce the heat to about 350 degrees and cook for about another 25-30 minutes. \r\nServe over a bed of jasmine rice,or cool and add to a bed of salad greens and enjoy!\r\nThe end result should be a wonderful, tasty, unique meal that your family or guests will savor!",

If whisked well, a good emulsion forms and the butter is incorporated into the marinade properly. Olive oil does not create the emulsion properly and distorts the intended flavor. The results were excellent, but I found that the marinade overpowered the chicken. On my second attempt, I added a half teaspoon each of nutmeg and sage, which enhanced the flavor of the chicken and balanced the recipe. Overall, very good!",

I was planning on making another honey mustard chicken recipe until I saw that this one called for curry.  I thought curry would make a tasty twist to the usual honey mustard variety (got a little carried away with the curry but still tasted great!).  After a few bites, my husband insisted that we have it again next week...and the week after that...pretty much EVERY week.  I only used about 2 Tbsp light butter-flavored spread instead of the 1/3 C butter.  I found that the sauce was still a good consistency.  Next time though, I'll be sure to double the sauce so I'll have plenty to drizzle over rice.  I love how the recipe only requires a few ingredients that I usually have on hand and the directions are very simple.  Five stars all the way!",

The combination of the curry, honey and mustard make a wonderful sauce that everyone who tries it is suprised. Everyone always ask me how to make it , which is why I am online to print out the recipe for the 10th time! It's not what you may expect and it is worth the try to see just how tasty this is.  My children love it too.  I sometimes will add a little cumin to the recipe for extra punch of spice.
