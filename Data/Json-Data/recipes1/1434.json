Edit 05/06: It's been a couple of years and I'm still making this cake. Made it tonight for a church cake auction tomorrow. Wanted to mention that I've started adding about half of a small can of drained crushed pineapple to the frosting...fold in in right before I put it on the cake. It adds a really nice twist.",
