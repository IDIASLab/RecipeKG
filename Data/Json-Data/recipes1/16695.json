He is new to pickling/canning but swears he followed the recipe to a \"T\" except he used a different brand of pickling salt Morton All Natural Canning and Pickling Salt (already had it on hand so why buy more?). The pickles turned out WAY too salty for everyone's liking. It's a shame because we have a lot of pickles that probably won't get eaten. This seems to be the only negative review on this recipe so I'm willing to consider that maybe something he did or didn't do had an affect on the outcome. Any input from other users of this recipe would be greatly appreciated.",
