I used 1 cup of whole cranberries in sauce (leftover from Christmas dinner) and cut the o.j. to half a cup.  Also added 1/2 cup craisins and used 1/2 cup raisins. I didnt have any nuts other than pecans but decided against using them as with it taking an hour to bake - didn't want the delicate pecans to burn. I also had no oranges for the zest but the o.j. was enough to flavour it.  It turned out to be a very nice, dense bread with lots of zing and I especially liked the use of the graham wafer crumbs - different!\nThanks for the recipe, with the above changes, I imagine it cut the fat by at least 2/3rds! Every little bit helps in the battle of the waist-line!",

Maybe I\u2019ll even try a little pineapple&less oil next time. It\u2019s very good. I just can\u2019t leave a good recipe well enough alone. :D The only changes I made are substituting an additional 1/4c graham crumbs&1/4c oats for the nuts due to allergy. \u2018Didn\u2019t have the orange rind either. Oh, well. :) A third cup oil isn\u2019t too much, but a quarter cup is fine as well. 12.12 Double recipe. \u2018Tried adding a can of crushed pineapple & while it wasn\u2019t bad, it wasn\u2019t better. I drained it&added enough orange juice to equal a cup. It just lessened the orange flavor, but really didn\u2019t add any pineapple flavor \u2013 even the pineapple pieces. Strange, but true! :D \u2018Stick with the original \u2013 for now. I\u2019m thinking of trying blueberries or half blue, half cran.1/2012: Tried frozen homegrown (sweet) blueberries & notsogood. This bread needs a stronger flavored fruit. I couldn\u2019t find any cranberries, even frozen, so used all blueberries \u2013 &more than it states. Mostly tasted the orange&it should be an afterthought, not first impression. \u2018Stickin\u2019 w cranberries! Oh, I forgot to tell ya there\u2019s NO need to chop those berries. What a waste of time. As you slice the bread \u2026 voila! 12/12/12 Tried the 1c confec, 2T oj, 1t vanilla glaze poked&poured while hot in pan. After 10, removed. More moist&sweet, but not a big flavorchanger. Good either way.Dbl:3/4c oats&no addt\u2019l gc for nuts.No dryness problem. 1 ",
