While this is a fairly standard way of making sausage and peppers, my family uses olive oil rather than butter, uses little or no herbs (fresh basil is always nice here), red wine rather than white, and some crushed or diced canned tomatoes, or marinara sauce.  Great on Italian rolls or over a sturdy pasta. This is always a treat!",

I've found on this website, that the simplest recipes many times prove to be the best.  I'm not an italian, but DAMN is this a great recipe!!!  \r\n Very important that you find good italian sausage. Find a good italian deli if you're lucky enough to have one nearby. I used mild sausage with the fennel seed inside--a key seasoning in good italian sausage.  One other thing though, I cooked everything in a dutch oven on the stovetop, and under low heat I left it on the stove for about 45 minutes, and found that the extra time further reduced and caramelized the onions and  the redpeppers, which makes this dish even better.  I served it with a side of pasta with my favorite Barilla pasta sauce.  It doesn't get any better than this recipe.  Thanks for sharing one of your favorite family recipes and spreading the love.",

First, while the sausage is cooking in the skillet, I put the crushed tomatoes in a dutch oven on low. Then when I sliced up the sausage, I added it to the dutch oven.\n\nI then did the onions and the garlic, using olive oil instead of butter. Instead of wine, I used an equal amount of beer. At the step where the peppers and onions are tender, I emptied the skillet into the dutch oven, and let everything simmer on low for 1 hour. \n\nThe last change was that the sauce was a bit loose, so a tablespoon of cornstarch mixed with a tablespoon of water, then added in with everything else. 15 minutes later, done.",
