Everyone in my home goes 'crazy' every time I bake it. Ms. (?) Grieshop did a wonderful thing by deciding to share this one! I tried English walnuts the first time but did not like it as well as the black walnuts in the second one. Perhaps M. Grieshop should add a suggestion to the recipe as to which nuts work better.....? However this 'typo' in no way detracts from the easiness and quickness experienced with baking this cake. Thank you M. Grieshop! Doris Rogers-Ripoll Brandon Florida (to the east of Tampa Bay)",

The only additions I made were to add 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. vanilla, and DEFINITELY is best with cream cheese frosting.  I use the 'Cream Cheese Frosting II' recipe here on allrecipes and it makes plenty to frost this with.  I also sprinkled some toasted coconut on top of the frosted cake.  This is so incredibly moist and a snap to make.  It feeds a large crowd, they will all oooh and ahhh, and you will go home with an empty cake pan.  Great for Hawaiian themed parties or potlucks.  This is a must do and also very economical to make.",

The result? Straight out of the oven 20 mins later the cake was like a thick pudding that tasted pineapple-ish and wasnt sweet enough. A bit too moist might have been better if I had let it cool some more. The walnuts were alright but seemed to add an unusual taste to the cake. My topping did turn out quite wonderfully though it consists of 1/2 cup flour 1/3 cup confectioners sugar 2 oz margarine and 1/2 cup of coconut and needs to be baked for 20-25mins so just let the cake bake and take it out to put the topping on then place it back in the oven.
