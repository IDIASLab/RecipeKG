I like Spicy.  It was thick with the added corn and beans, but very hearty and delicious.  Thanks for the great recipes.  I will make it again. :)",

As per other reviews I went without the tomato sauce and instead doubled the diced tomatoes. Add a can of black beans. Added some spices - cumin chili powder paprika garlic salt black pepper to taste. You can really play around with this recipe to suit your tastes. I'm a from-scratch kind of cook myself but because of how well this turned out I will be taking the shortcut route in the future for tortilla soup. Love it!",
