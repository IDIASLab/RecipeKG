(LOVE IT)  If you put the cauliflower in a food processor and chopped it up to about rice size, then microwave it covered for about a minute 30, it is a great Basmati rice substitute!  It cuts the calories in half! But only nuke the Cauliflower in the portions you need it.  That way if you have leftovers you just put the raw cauliflower in a dish with the curry over it and it will cook when you heat it all up together.  Hope this helps someone! And thanks for the recipe! :)",

I thought the curry sauce was a great and easy way to make curry. You do have to add you own spice if you want it spicy at all. I added a bit of red pepper to my chutney when I made it and that did it. My kids and husband loved it and that's always a hard test to pass!",

I saw this recipe and it sounded good but when I read the reviews I saw that others wanted more of a kick to it.  I like SPICEY Indian food so instead of buying Apple chutney I bought something called Pineapple Pepper chutney.  WOW - this was a great dish and the next time I will double the sauce because right now I would just love to eat the rice and sauce.  The caulifower was geat too. Thanks submitter.",
