After the 'cake' cooled in the pan I scooped into a pudding bowl and placed into the fridge. A couple of hours later voila! It becomes a lovely moist cake. I have made this recipe twice. The second time I used rum instead of brandy. And both times my family and friends love it!",

I wasn't quite sure what bittersweet chocolate was so I used what I had around the house -- 6 squares of semi-sweet chocolate and 3 squares of unsweetened chocolate. The flavor of the melted chocolate was really good so I guess I didn't mess that up. However I wasn't sure from the directions whether I was supposed to drain the prunes before adding. Consequently I added both prunes and brandy. The brandy flavor in the baked cake was much too strong and the outside burned while the inside remained gooey. Was the texture supposed to be fudgy? Cakey? I just don't know. The cake sounded rich and even elegant and I figured the prunes would make it moist but they kind of had the effect of adding Ex-Lax to brownies. Probably not a good dessert to serve to guests. Hopefully someone else will try this recipe and have better luck than I.",
