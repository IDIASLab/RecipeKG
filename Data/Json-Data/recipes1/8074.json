Then I roasted them in a 350 oven for 10 minutes and rubbed them in a clean dish towel to remove the brown skin. Then I had to ground them for the recipe. Two pounds of hazelnuts in the shell made about 2 1/4 cups of ground hazelnuts. After all that the recipe was a snap! I would definitely make these again but will probably look for hazelnuts already shelled and peeled.",

I used 3/4 cup oil instead of the butter added 1/2 teaspoon salt increased the hazelnuts to 2 1/2 cups (I had bags of already ground hazelnuts) used 1 1/2 cups potato starch (no flour of course) and used one whole egg. I also used raw honey rather than sugar but I'm sure my modified recipe would work fine with sugar too. I did not make a filling as I just wanted plain hazelnut cookies. The cookies spread out a lot so if you make them this way leave plenty of room between them. They came out beautifully and everyone loved them! They tasted like gourmet cookies rather than Passover cookies. I will definitely make these again!",
