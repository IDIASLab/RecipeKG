I didn't really realize this until I was halfway finished preparing it.:o) I have a recipe for a gallette that has a few more ingredients (lemon juice raisins flour) and a few more steps but either recipe is hard to mess up. If you don't like all the juices from the peaches soaking into the gallette you can use a cookie sheet with a rim or a jelly roll pan. It'll make it drier that way. Either way very simple very good. Easily adjusted for whatever type of fruit you feel like using. I've made galettes with canned and frozen fruit--just make sure you drain canned fruit and adjust sugar accordingly. I prefer mixing the sugar salt and cinnamon together instead of just sprinkling. Otherwise good recipe. Easy way to impress when entertaining!",
