Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the cake particularly heavy or dense. I was careful to beat the batter until \"fluffy\", as called for in the recipe. This requires beating at high speed for at least 5 minutes after all ingredients are well-incorporated.  The color of the batter lightens as you continue to beat it.  The volume of batter was too much for my two 8\" X 1.5\" round cake pans, so I made several cupcakes with the surplus.  Though the cupcakes were ready after 20-25 minutes in the oven, the cakes themselves required an extra 10-15 minutes to bake.  The un-iced cupcakes disappeared in minutes, but the layers are going in the freezer until fresh strawberries, nectarines and peaches are in season. IMHO, a cake this rich would be best served with either fruit and whipped cream or iced with a light (non-buttercream) icing.  ",

I always let my Kitchenaid at them for almost 5 minutes. It rose so high it overflowed the pans. Will make again (often) in a 13x9 pan next time.
