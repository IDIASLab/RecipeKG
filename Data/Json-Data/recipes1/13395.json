My son, who loves zucchini, devoured it, and even my daughter, who usually does not like it, ate this also; ditto for my hubby.  The stuffing was perfect, and the tomato salsa so fresh and yummy and a great way to also use the summer herbs from my garden.  The salsa was even good on top of our grilled chicken!!  The only change I made was to add parmesan cheese to the stuffing, as well as a little extra on top.  What a wonderful, delicious summer recipe!",

Also sprinkled a bit of mozzarella on top too- not much! The tomato salsa was great and I suggest making enough to really cover the recipe in it. Next time I try it though, I'm going to use a marinara sauce to pour over top after they come out of the over because I think that would really compliment it. The breadcrumbs just made the mixture a little dry so any added moisture would be great. Maybe even more chicken broth to add. I'll definitely make this again. It's a great meal. We ate it with a spinach salad and felt like a million bucks after!",

I made it exactly as written only with the addition of some goat cheese on top before popping the dish into the oven. The tomato salsa is a must have and make it before starting the zucchini so it has time for the flavors to come out. Great recipe! Thank you!!",

Also you definitely can cut the basil amount in half and the parsley amount in half if you don't want it too herby... I think the original recipe is too herby for my tastes... Also don't add too much olive oil to the tomatoe mixture as you'll be using olive oil later on to heat the zuchinni in step 4.",
