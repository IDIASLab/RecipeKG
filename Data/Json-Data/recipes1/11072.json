On this my first attempt I also adjusted the flour ratio having only 5 1/4 cups rye flour to which I added 3/4 cups whole wheat. The additional whole wheat made the dough sticky so I ended up blending in another 1/4 - 1/3 cups all purpose flour during kneading. Even with the adjustments this is a nice dense loaf of bread which is great tasting and ideal for sandwiches (i.e. Meatloaf) I will try this again with the adjusted salt content and correct flour amounts. This recipe is a keeper.",
