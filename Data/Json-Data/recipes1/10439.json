Something I've started doing is making these without the shrimp but adding chopped chives and green onions to the cheese mixture instead and serving alongside homemade tomato basil soup....I don't think life gets any better than that especially on a cold winter's night!!

Big improvement for a little work get a handful of medium frozen shrimp boil them in lightly salted water chop them and use them instead of those babies out of the can. I used 5oz of pub cheese because I didn't have the Old English and it was just as good. Lastly bake them on the halved english muffins and cut them into wedges after they've rested for a couple of minutes. This allows all of that cheese and butter to settle into the nooks and cranies before you cut into them let it all melt out onto the tray all run out. YUM!",
