Sometimes I heat up the water and milk real quick and let the quinoa soak while I'm in the shower, that way it can cook while I get ready and only needs a couple more minutes once everything else is added. Top with granola, if desired. Apple slices and/or sauce can be substituted for banana.",

I used quinoa for extra protein to help me get through really long days. I've added flax seed blueberries diced apples dried cranberries peaches etc. to this recipe. Some will find it sweet enough with just the banana but if you're like me and you live molasses brown sugar adds a nice flavor. I think you could make this with pretty much any grain you want - sometimes I toss in a little polenta or grits but it's important to use slow-cooking oats not the quick-cook or instant oats.",

I don't have oat bran but I've successfully used both wheat germ and ground flaxseed in its place. Also I LOVE cinnamon (and it's actually very healthy) so I added between 1/2 - 1 tsp. Additionally I used raw pumpkin seeds rather than the walnuts as I am vegetarian and the provide extra iron aside from the fact that they add a delicious crunch. Lastly the vanilla is a must - it makes the dish. A great way to start the day.",

This is probably a healthier choice going forward. I did not use the brown sugar I used one whole banana. It was plenty sweet enough for my taste. I found that there wasn't quite enough liquid in the recipe so with such a small serving size the kind of pot you use will make a difference. I used a larger skillet and too much liquid evaporated (so I had to add more a couple of times) plus my quinoa did not get as done as I would have liked. I would have rated it more in the 4.5 range if I had the choice because it is definately worth making but it's not really a 5 star recipe in the grand scheme of things. All in all I will make this again! Next time I will make a quadruple recipe to share.",
