After mashing and measuring the potatoes, I cut all the ingredients in half, put everything in the breadmaker and processed on the \"dough\" cycle.  I did use one full tablespoon of yeast as per my machine manufacturer's recommendations, and I exchanged whole wheat flour for half of the flour, and the rolls were soft and delicious.  I've made these twice, and I find that I need to cover them loosely with foil before I put them in the oven, and remove the foil about a minute before they're done so they brown nicely.  Otherwise they were darkening too fast.  My family loves these.",

I made a dozen big fluffy crescents and then a dozen & a half cinnamon rolls from the rest of the dough, using a brown sugar, cinnamon, and pecan filling and topping them with a powdered sugar glaze flavored with maple.

I didn't let it rise in the fridge as specified, I let it rise in a warm place until it doubled--I was too impatient for it to rise overnight or for days!  :)  It is nice to know you can make it ahead, though.

I scaled the recipe in half so I could do it in my bread machine.  I used 1 mashed yukon gold potato, butter flavored shortening (I use butter with a good result as well) and added 2 Tbsp. dry milk powder.  Even though I scaled the recipe in half I used an entire packet of yeast.  I added the ingredients according to the instructions for my bread machine and ran it on the dough cycle.  When it was done I sprayed a 9 x 13 pan with Pam, shaped the dough into balls and put them 4 across in the pan.  Covered with plastic wrap and stored in my refrigerator overnight.  On Thanksgiving I took the pan out of the refrigerator about 3 hours before I was ready to bake them and put them on my counter covered with a kitchen towel to let them come to room temperature and rise up (they will need at least 3 hours to do this).  I brushed the tops with butter once while cooking and again right after removing from the oven.  Amazing result!  I will make this frequently.",

I wanted a dinner roll instead of a sweet type roll so I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup. It was definetely the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner this year.

I had to watch them in the oven closely because they can brown too much on the bottom if you are not watching. I made dinner rolls and cinnamon buns(just coated with melted butter and cinnamon and sugar on one side before rolling)from the same batch. It is a really big help around the holidays when like me you have several places to take food too; you need variety. The recipe is simple and quite versatile. You can add minced onion garlic or herbs to change things up. I served the regular rolls with honey herb and orange-cranberry butter... but who is to say that you can't add these ingredients to the batter? I look forward to trying a variety of additives to this 5 star winner!",

The one and only recommendation I would make is to cut the sugar if you're looking for a dinner roll and not a sweet roll. I used 6 Tb which gave a subtle hint of sweetness to the flavor but stopped short of defining it as more appropriate for a sweet breakfast roll. Easiest way to cut? Use a pizza cutter to cut your rolled circle into quarters then divide those quarters in half to make eighths then subcut those in half to get 16. All cuts need to intersect at one point in the center of the circle. After cutting spread with the butter (I don't melt - just use softened butter. Melting is an unnecessary extra step and one more item to wash) then roll up each wedge as described in the directions. Be sure to wait sufficient time after shaping the refrigerated dough into individual rolls for a complete rise. For me that took about an hour and 20 minutes (your timing could be more because of kitchen temp. I'm in south FL so it's always pretty warm.) This step yields the maximum lightness of texture just as rushing things will contribute to a heaviness in your finished product. I've made these countless times now. Perfect every time. Superb heirloom recipe. Thank you for posting it.",

I am not sure I would leave raw eggs to sit in this recipe for the 'up to 5 days' mentioned.  Not sure that is a good idea.",
