Don't even think about leaving out the horseradish (I love the Inglehoffer brand)! I had to make it in the 10 minutes I had this afternoon and it was ready tonight with full flavor. We started out dipping our carrots and broccoli in it--yum! Then we had it on our salads (mixed with a little Italian dressing). We are now thinking that it will be ever so yummy in something like gyros. And the mind keeps working on new ideas of how to use this new addition to our recipe box! Thanks Tat2! PS: In reading my review I wanted to make sure that you knew I used regular mayo and sour cream!",

Of the herbs & spices I use fresh if & when available (such as the garlic dill basil etc.) I used New Mexican red chile powder & 'hot' Hungarian paprika. The 2 cooked slices of real bacon were reduced to tiny particles in a mini-food processor. The sour cream & mayo were low fat (50% less fat). I have cut-up vegs available to dip in it & eat as much as I want; especially good are cucumber slices & red bell peppers. Also great with no- or low-fat 100% whole wheat crackers like Kavli Norwegian crispbreads German Wasa crispbreads & Akmok crackers. Also used some of this ranch dip in AR's \"Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs\" with these changes: 1/3 c. of this NGZ Ranch 1/3 c. buttermilk double the rosemary increased all other ingredients by 50% = excellent & comparable in taste to the orig. chicken kabob recipe. I highly recommend this dip!",

I wanted to keep this recipe low cal so I used reduced fat cream cheese that I had in the refrigerator.I used Greek yogurt instead of plain and omitted the bacon bits simply to keep the calorie count down. After allowing the dip to set for several hours I took a taste heaven! The flavors of the herbs and spices are fantastic. As if I hadn t made enough changes to this recipe already I decided to make one more! Had an English cucumber on hand; diced up about 1 cup and added it. This doesn t change the flavor just adds volume and crunch. Due to using cream cheese this turned out to be more of a spread.",
