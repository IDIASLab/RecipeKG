I found the eggplant slices a bit bland, so next time I'll just pat them dry (instead of rinsing all the salt off), which will help with flavor. Even though I was generous with the pizza sauce, 1 cup was too much. I also ended up doubling the olives and pepperoni because the stated amounts weren't nearly enough to cover 12 slices.  There is plenty of cheese, so you might not even use it all. The cook time was spot on. Such a great pizza alternative that I'll definitely make again!",
