The only difference that I made with this recipe is that I felt that it needed a topping on it so I crumbled up Cheez-Its and sprinkled them over the top before baking it again for five more minutes. It gave the liquidy casserole a bit more substance to it. Excellent recipe will definitely be making it again!",

I do cut back on the cheese (I also just use a shredded bag of mixed Italian cheeses) a bit and add a splash or two of milk to thin out the soup to make it easier to spread. Great alternative to the ever popular green bean casserole and a nice way to bring asparagus to dinner that is familiar taste to so many.",
