I made a few changes: I decreased the flour to 3 cups (perfect), increased the coconut to 3/4 cup and toasted it, and used toasted pecans or almonds instead of walnuts (I like the flavor of the other two better).  One time I forgot to add the coconut extract and the coconut flavor was not nearly so pronounced.  I usually drizzle chocolate over the top for looks.  This is a really great recipe, and if you like coconut you  will fall in love.",

Some reviews said this was too crumbly (just add some milk to the mix people!) but mine came out great. I dipped some in white chocolate and others in dark--excellent! Tip: Use a ruler to help shape the biscotti: use the flat side of a normal 12 inch ruler and \"scrape\" the biscotti into shape on a flat (preferably cold) countertop. This way you can tell just how thick and how flat the biscotti is; if that made any sense.",
