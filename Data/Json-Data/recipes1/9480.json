Instead of using beer as a marinade, I used a peach/raspberry wine cooler, 1 tsp. oregano, 2 tsp. of parsley. I then, in a set aside conatiner, cut up onions, green peppers, and celery, marninating those in a mix of olive oil, minced garlic, and oregano. I stir fried the chicken and veggies and then mixed it with whole wheat spaghetti, 1 cup of grated mozzarella/parm cheese, and added parsley to taste. Not exactly the same recipe as listed but still very good.",
