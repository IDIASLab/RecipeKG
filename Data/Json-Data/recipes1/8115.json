Typically I just put it in a crock pot, vice using the oven, and it takes about 30-45 mins on high.  I also found that when you use the crock pot, you usually don't need any broth to keep it moist, the stuffing seems to retain it's moisture pretty well by itself.  I would make one change, only to make this recipe a little quicker, and that is to just use the Jimmy Dean sausage, with sage, so you don't have to measure it out.  The flavor is still just as perfect.  Oh, and the cheap grocery store bread works best for this recipe as well!  Thank you for the great recipe!",

I made the dish \"veggie\" by using vegetarian style sausage instead of meat sausage (cuts down a lot on saturated fat and calories too!). I use the kind in a roll and prepare it by chopping the uncooked sausage into bite-sized pieces and then saute until browned. This keeps it from having a sticky squishy texture. I also added some vegetable broth to keep it moist seasoned with McCormick brand poultry seasoning and used soft potato bread cubes. I used red skinned potatoes and kept the skins on for extra fiber and color. I got compliments on how moist and flavorful it was.",
