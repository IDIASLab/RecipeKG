I wanted to let folks know that before you put the potato mixture in the pan, take the scoop and make sure to drain the liquid out by holding the spoonful of potato against the side if the bowl.  Also we usually crush the saltines in a Baggie, saves on mess. The saltines act as a binder. Hope you love these as much as we do. My favorite way to eat them is with sour cream. The don't reheat well in microwave (in my experience) but do reheat fairly well in a toaster oven.",

Yet, like many things, food is enjoyed and needed by every culture...from the Middle East to Scandinavia to Thailand. Universally good food is just that. It worked well for me to use a little oil on the pan for each pancake and not immersing it, adding more when flipping. Glad I watched the video to freshen up my potato squeezing technique. I don't have a spinner...plus it makes me dizzy. Grated cheese might be good. Seems any kind of binder works...might try pulverized flavored croutons after the roasted Panko crumbs after the home made whole wheat seasoned bread crumbs after the Cheezy crackers (ok, I'll stop now).",

The directions here don't mention you should soak the potatoes in water to get rid of excess starch, then squeeze the water out of the potatoes by stuffing it into a clean dish towel, then applying as much pressure as you can. I did the same with the onion. I think this made a tremendous difference in the final texture, which was crispy and held together, rather than watery and falling apart (as has happened to me in the past).\n\nThe video also suggested serving with lox over the sour cream, also a hit.\n\nOverall: fantastic!

I am not a fan of shredding potatoes, so I just used a 20oz bag of simply shredded potatoes. I measured it and it came to 4 cups. I used the whole bag anyhow and it was fine. I followed through the rest of the recipe, although I did not have saltine crackers. So, I used 3 sweet potato and chive flat stick crackers. They can't be seen or tasted anyhow. It is more for a binder. I just pureed the crackers and onions in my Vitamix blender moving the dial to medium for about 10 seconds. That made that part super easy too. I was hoping to not have to use a full 1/2 cup of vegetable oil. I used safflower oil and I did end up using 6 Tablespoons of it divided. Extra oil is needed, in this recipe, to make the potatoes crispy and hold together. With a muffin scoop, and as made, I got 10 patties at 162.5 calories each. ty",
