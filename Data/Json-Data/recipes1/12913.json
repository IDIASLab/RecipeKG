First of all I double-dipped the tomato slices...flour egg wash (1 egg w/some milk) and then flour again. It created more of a crunchy texture which I really love. For the gravy I only added about a teaspoon of brown sugar because 2 Tbsp. seems like an awful lot. I guess it's a matter of taste but I liked it with less sugar. But it turned out very good and I will make it again!",
