I also like to use ranch-dressing dry mix in lieu of the garlic salt at times--you can also use garlic powder with salted cheddar popcorn topping--the possibilities are endless!----One of my kids' fave all-time snacks are actually borne of the \"crouton\" premise: Called \"Crustinos\", you make them by slicing basic french or italian bread into approx. 1/2 inch thick slices, then spraying the slices with butter-flavored cooking spray, adding your seasoning atop, and baking at 200 degrees until they are light golden and crispy.  So much better for everyone than chips--and they keep for a week or more in a sealed bag (although I cannot keep any in my house more than 24 hours--the kids eat them up fast).  When you have a salad or soup,(or even need bread crumbs for a coating) take a few and break them up. Quick, easy, and a great way to use up extra leftover bread.",
