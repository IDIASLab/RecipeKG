It didn't completely set for me either but i didn't let the jello mix melt. Bf loved it and ate 4 pieces of it last night. So even though it didn't set (and it's probably bc I didn't make sure the jello mix was cool) this is a simple recipe that could have a great presentation if I'd just follow the directions. I'll probably make again and try to be less impatient in making it. Thanks for the recipe!",

The difference between her recipe and these is this. She would cook 3 whole eggs with the sugar and can of crushed pineapple. Of course on low and stirring constantly then add jello. After mixture had cooled fold into whipped evaporated milk. It was the very taste of Christmas in your mouth!!",
