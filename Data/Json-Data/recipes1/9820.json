                "reviewBody": "With my native Texan hubby needing a fajita \"fix\" I prepared this on one slab (both sides) of the beef and just sprinkled the other slab with a popular brand fajita seasoning. I was scared that he wouldn't like this at all since limes are more of a southwest thing than a Texas (San Antonio) thing. This recipe won, with our entire family, hands down! I used dried cilantro and lime juice from the plastic bottle, omitted the anise. One thing I must add, I doubled this recipe and it was barely enough. This is a rather pasty concoction (I could add more liquid but we were honestly thrilled with the taste so I hate to fix what isn't broken) and I would definitely not hesitate to double/triple again in the future. We marinated beef about 30 hours. We will definitely be using this recipe again and again! Muchos gracias for sharing the recipe and I hope that my comments have helped you with your meal planning. Mmmmm!",

I probably would have given this recipe 4 1/2 stars if that was possible only because my husband thought the chicken we marinated (overnight) was a little heavy on the lime. The leftovers weren't quite so lime-heavy. I think the next time we make this we'll use a bit less lime juice and make up the difference with some broth. This recipe is definitely a keeper!",

I didn't have any green onions so I used fresh chives (a big handful) also I used paste cilantro since I had it on hand. I didn't have fresh limes but used key lime juice insead. I also added some chicken broth to stretch the marinade so that it completely covered all the meat. I ended up letting it marinate for three days before using it. Then I cooked the meat adding some marinade as it cooked and put it on a platter in a warm oven while I cooked the sweet onion and red pepper. I also added some of the marinade to these as they cooked. Once it was all carmel colored we had the best fajita dinner ever!! I also smashed some freshed avocado (with added lime juice garlic powder and sea salt). Can't imagine eating fajitas without guacamole. Hope this helps someone.",
