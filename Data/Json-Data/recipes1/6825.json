I bought about a pound of boneless top sirloin and adjusted everything so that it would fit with a pound of meat. I didn't really make any changes to add my own flavor to the recipe but I did use garlic powder with some herbs mixed in, and I used a George Foreman Grill. 5 minutes in the good ol' GF Grill and they were done to my liking. Quite possibly some of the best tasting steak I have ever had and it only took about 15-20 minutes from fridge to my stomach. As a side note I'd like to recommend a good Fat Tire beer to go along with it, simply tasty!",

I rubbed them with meat tenderizer and cracked black pepper, and let them rest on the counter for about an hour. Then heated a cast-iron skillet and threw a little salt in the pan, seared the steaks about 4 or 5 minutes per side until they released from the pan. This gave them a nice browned crust while the inside remained fork-tender. Didn't change a thing about the sauce, these steaks were awesome!",

This recipe caught my eye with its addition of  garlic powder, and while I kind of knew this would be over the top garlic for me I figured 200+ reviewers who loved it couldn't be wrong, so I was willing to give it a try. Turns out I was right. Should have used a more reasonable amount of fresh garlic, cooked it a little to take the raw garlic taste out of it, and left it at that! Better yet, I should have had my husband's wonderful, perfectly grilled steak just as is. The taste of raw fresh garlic and the strong taste of the garlic powder was just unpleasant. More often than not, it's best to trust your instincts.",

This is because the directions say to simply toss in the butter, powder and raw minced garlic, then melt it.\n\nWhat it should say is to saute finely minced garlic in just a small amount of butter until it begins to caramelize, then remove it from the heat and add the remainder of butter, stirring as it melts in.  This will give you a rich but not overpowering garlic butter.\n\nAdding garlic powder at that point is optional, it depends on how strong of a flavor you'd like.",

I used it on filet mignon for a special occasion and not a morsel was to be found afterwards. I also added chopped fresh chives and parsley to the butter. Just a little tip: During the holiday season I used a recipe very similar to yours to make refrigerated crescent rolls. After unrolling the crescent rolls flat on a baking sheet I brushed on a little of a mixture similar to this and everyone went wild. Of course we had turkey and ham (no need for garlic) and the cresent rolls were a lively surprise & hit. I also tried this on broccoli and it was lucious.",
