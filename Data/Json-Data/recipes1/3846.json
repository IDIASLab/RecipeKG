Makes tons of leftovers especially if you add extra ingredients (such as 3 half chicken breasts 0 then you don't have to freeze one) the whole pound of sausage and the entire jar of spaghetti sauce! One problem: slicing raw sausage is difficult and the sausage oozes out of the casing. The bits get burned when browning. I recommend browning them whole and then slicing them. Also I recommend cooking the onion and pepper mixture uncovered so the meat doesn't steam. I will definitely make this again with some changes in preparation! Thanks Mary!",

I then cooked the onion/green pepper mixture in a large pot in a small amount of oil. Once that was done I added the cut up meat and the rest of the ingredients and simmered on low for approximately 30 - 40 mins. I then cooked the pasta and dished it up seperately then spooned the sauce mixture over top instead of mixing it all together. Awesome recipe Mary! Thanks!",

I dont see the need for two meats unless you happen to have some leftover chicken from the night before because it still tastes like a marinara pasta dish...The italian sausage will dominate any chicken flavor. Plus - why thaw two kinds of meat when one will suffice?? However - I had a ton of zuchini from my garden this year and I'm glad I tried this. Would make again and use one (or the other) meat.

I did not use the zucchini or green pepper and I used some fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned and a little more garlic. I also followed the advice of another reader and cooked the sausages whole and then sliced them I may do that next time with the chicken as well. I used only one jar(26 oz)of sauce which was plenty. When serving I tossed about 1/2 of the sausage/chicken mixture with the pasta and served the remaining mixture on the side. With a loaf of italian bread and a salad and some parmesan cheese this was a very nice meal. My family loved it. Thank you for sharing Linda.",
