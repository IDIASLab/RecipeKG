I subbed frozen corn for the beans. I added some chopped onions. I used chix stock instead of water (to enhance the flavor). The soup never thickened to a chowdery consistency but maybe b/c I used skim milk. The purple coloring was very odd but the soup tasted very good. Some additional garnishes I used were diced scallions and grated cheddar. It was an easy recipe and I would make it again.",
