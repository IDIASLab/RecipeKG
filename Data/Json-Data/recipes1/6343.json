I really like the idea because it has the potential to be a flavorful yet healthy salad dressing (which can be hard to find). I would adjust the amount of thyme next time because I thought it was a bit overwhelming. I'd play with the other spices too - maybe try fresh herbs and add oregano or parsley and also salt pepper garlic and onion. I might play around with the vinegar too - maybe try balsamic. Sun dried tomatoes might be a good touch too. The options are endless!",

I also used Dijon instead of ground mustard and punched it up with some salt and pepper and 2 garlic cloves. Whirred it all up in the blender and DELISH!!!  Omit the vinegar and this could be poured over pasta!  In response to other posters stating this was a bit bitter...try removing the tomato seeds before blending. That may take care of the bitterness issue. You can also try a pinch of sugar. \nThanks recipe poster. This one is a keeper!",

This recipe reminded me of a salad dressing I used to adore so of course they quit making it (UGH)...so I made this recipe exactly but with the following additions- I added a clove of garlic because everyone knows garlic makes most things better and I added some bacon bits because the discontinued dressing I loved had them plus everyone knows bacon makes everything better. Then I tossed this in a Ziplock bag with some boneless skinless chicken breasts let them marinate overnight and most of the day and grilled them up. Very very fresh and tasty. A lovely flavorful healthy meal. Thanks for sharing the recipe Jen! I will surely make this again as both a marinade and a salad dressing:)",
