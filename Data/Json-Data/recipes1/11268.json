It can also be enhanced with all manner of vegetable matter to round out your diet: diced broccoli, sweet corn kernels, red/green/yellow bell pepper, chopped fennel, plus more. We call it the enthusiastic dahl--because we can put everything we've got into it. \n\nAdding garam masala towards the end of cooking increases flavour without heat. Lightly toasting dry chilli powder at the start in oil likewise increases flavour without increasing the heat factor as much as adding it later would. \n\nAdding a small can of coconut milk during cooking will enrich the flavour for festive occasions and/or provide much-needed fats for (thinner) vegetarians. The dahl can also be garnished with lime juice and tabasco sauce as well as some chopped cilantro. Chapatti fried in butter makes a nice accompaniment and alternative to the basmati rice or brown rice standard.\n\nHing can be stored in a well sealing jar--such as that used for premium instant coffees. Even if you do not drink coffee, it's a small price to pay for a practical solution to the Hing smell issue.\nN.B. Hing seems to work well with the flavour of cardamom seeds and makes a killer red lentil dahl.",

I soaked the split yellow peas for a few hours, which both softens them and helps to reduce gassy side-effects for people not used to eating them.  For the people who said they take much longer to cook, perhaps they are using a different kind of pea.  I found mine in the ethnic food aisle of my supermarket, and it was marked Mung Dal.  \n\nI sauteed an onion, cubanelle pepper, some carrots, roma tomatoes (all chopped up in my mini food processor) in some olive oil, added some frozen corn kernels, and let them soften.  I added a couple of garlic cloves, let them cook a bit, and then added my spices: about a teaspoon of chili powder I had toasted prior, 1 ts of ground ginger (didn't have fresh), 1/2 ts of coriander, 1 ts of cumin, and a couple of bay leaves and some salt.  I let that sautee with the veggies a little and added the drained peas (2 cups).  Then I added 4 cups of chicken broth and let it cook for 20 minutes while I cooked some jasmine rice.  It was super yummy.  My point is that you really can make it your own and develop it according to your tastes if you don't have the exact recipe components on hand.  :)",

What I learned from this recipe:\n- substitutions work well: I used the limes of 4 whole limes (3 TB) not lemon\n- I did not use asafoejida or anything to substitute for it\n- I used coconut oil to make this makers-diet-friendly, but it probably added to the flavor, and finally\n- the one part of this recipe that made this dish more \"Indian\" in the sense of \"like the Indian restaurants I frequent\" was adding cumin to the oil. When I did that, it was instantly flavored and scented like I imagines it should be.\nBon Appetit!",

I also substituted finely chopped carrot and onion for the tomatoes which I cooked in margarine along with the spices. I used 1/2 tsp of cayenne for the heat.
