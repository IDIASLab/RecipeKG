I also used evaporated milk for the milk. My husband doesn't like chicken breasts so I used boneless chicken thighs and I'm telling you all... it was fantastic!!! We truly loved this dish and it will be a regular on my weeknight table. Not only does it taste wonderful, comforting and homey, it's easy and quick! Thank you Colleen!",

If you use the frozen variety you don't even need to defrost,  just place in mixture at the time you add the chicken.\r\n\r\nI serve on Puff Pastry Shells which  you can find in the frozen food section of you supermarket.   I have also served on chow mein noodles or toast points.\r\n\r\nThis recipe freezes well as it makes plenty and can be defrosted on the stovetop or in the microwave.\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing.",

I added an 1/2 a cube of boullion(on top of what was called for) as it seemed to need that extra boost, also I left out the peppers and pimentos and added a cup of peas the last minute or so of cooking.
