Mixing up some Velveeta with cooked noodles is a no-brainer, really, but it was a real inspiration and time-saver for me tonight.  Skipping the steps of a roux and/or a period of time in the oven simplified this macaroni and cheese, and in my opinion didn't really compromise it.  In all fairness, however, I couldn't resist adding a good blob of butter and a couple tablespoons of Vermont Cheese Powder (King Arthur Flour's).  This was so convincing compared to the \"real deal\" that Hubs didn't even know the difference - and had I not cooked it myself, I'm not sure I would have either. It just goes to show you that a dish being labor intensive doesn't necessarily make it that much better - if at all.",

I liked that it had the same creamy consistency of the boxed mac & cheese with the cheese packet (not the powdered cheese) but that it wasn't as salty. I didn't use exact measurements I sorta just winged it but I used these ingredients and followed the recipe loosely except that I added about 3 Tbsp unsalted butter to the cooked noodles cheese and milk. Also I used penne rigate noodles and that worked great that shape is easier to pick up with a fork than elbow noodles sometimes. Super easy and I will definitely continue to make this regularly!",
