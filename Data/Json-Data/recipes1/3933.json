Instead of Italian dressing I put in sun-dried tomato dressing.. this makes a huge difference!! When I switched dressings it was a favorite of everybody who tasted it! If you go with fresh veggies it makes a world of a difference! I personally am not a big fan of black olives but if you get the petite diced cut you can't go wrong in this salad and it taste so much better with it!",

I mixed cheeses (shredded cheddar and mozzarella) and used a little less dressing because I dislike the oily after effects. I added Italian herbs to replace flavor that may be compromized by reducing dressing. It would be great with grilled chicken strips and cherry tomatoes added too. Very versatile.",

If you let it set in the refrigerator too long you may have to add more dressing to it because the noodles really soak it up. I recommend taste testing to before serving if its been in the refrigerator to make sure it has enough dressing still! Thanks!",
