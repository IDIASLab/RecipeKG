I think I would like to try this with milk chocolate chips mini if I can find them and use less than two cups. I felt the semi-sweet chips covered up the flavor of the graham. Maybe a teaspoon of cinnamon with the dry ingredients would further enhance the spiciness. My experience: I used a medium scoop (about 2 Tbs?) to form the balls cooked for 12 minutes left on the sheet for 2 more before moving to the cooling rack. They came out beautifully.
