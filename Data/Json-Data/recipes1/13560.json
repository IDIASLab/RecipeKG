Half of it went into the oven at 275 degrees - the other half went into the crockpot.  I did everything like the recipe except I also added about a half cup of beef broth (someone suggested this).  After 7 hours of cooking, I put them side by side and asked my husband and teenage son to critique them.  The oven cooked brisket was juicier and it fell apart - my son liked it the best.  The crockpot brisket sliced and had more of a texture of a roast.  My husband like it the best.  Me?  I was pleased with both and pretty tickled at myself for the experiment.",

I have used this many times with success every single time! Fork tender, great flavor and EASY! What could be better? I did make very slight additions: I used a dash of Thyme, onion powder & brown sugar (maybe 2T of Br. sugar) along with the soup mix and the rest. I put all the dry ingredients on the meat & 'patted' them in before I load it into the bag. Then I pour over the Liquid Smoke after I place it in the bag. I placed 1 whole large sweet onion in large slices over the top, then threw on Red Potatoes cut in half. Seal it up. I was short on time so I cooked at 325* for 4 hours. PERFECT!!! Rave reviews from all 8 people at the table...I call that success! I Like the potatoes this way too...makes it so easy to open the hot bag, throw together a salad, and you have dinner!",

I doubled the recipe since I had lots of people coming over.  I shouldn't have doubled the flour portion; it just wasn't necessary.  But everything else worked out really great.  I saw someone else had mentioned that their recipe turned out dry.  I don't really get that because my very fatty brisket gave up so much liquid, that it was being braised there towards the last third of the cooking.  But I did only cook the brisket for 6 hours, as recommended, and it worked out great.  Thanks for the recipe, it will definitely be part of my summer repertoire!",
