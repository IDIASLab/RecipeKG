I didn't have vanilla yogurt so I used plain Greek yogurt with a dash of honey mustard and it was great. Next time I make it I might add some cilantro or parsley and frozen peas. It's very versatile so add what you have and make it colorful. I'm thinking of red yellow orange peppers if you like that. My husband added a diced pickle to his serving. A good alternative to Mayonnaise based potato salads.",
