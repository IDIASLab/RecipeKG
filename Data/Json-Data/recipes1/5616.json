In my judgement they are in flavor and crumb more like a basic muffin (the non-cake type). Not moist enough for my liking nor are they sweet enough. Their saving grace is the frosting which is to-die-for good but even then I tinkered with the recipe because it wouldn't have worked for me as written. Since I piped the frosting and needed it to be stiffer I used a little more powdered sugar than called for and considerably less root beer. At least this awesome frosting picked up the slack for the lifeless cupcakes. They were pretty no doubt about it with their swirls of delicately caramel-colored frosting and bits of crushed root beer barrels I sprinkled them with as garnish but being pretty isn't enough. I am still looking to make a great root beer cake so if I was to use this recipe again I'd probably add another egg maybe even two and another 1/2 cup sugar.",
