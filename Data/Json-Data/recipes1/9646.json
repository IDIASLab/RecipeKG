I used 1 lb of 93% lean beef (no draining neccessary) pinto beans and an equal amount of frozen defrosted corn. I also accidentally opened a can of diced tomatoes with basil garlic and oregano so I just used it. The directions say add taco seasoning but I didn't see it in the ingredient list so I just stuck to the ingredient list and used only the dry onion soup mix. I also only simmered for about 20-25 minutes so the ingredients didn't turn to mush. When done we topped with cheese. I probably only rated it a 4 because of the sodium which I try to watch and it uses all canned ingredients. But the recipe seems adaptable to changes. And if making again I would double the recipe because it only makes about 5 servings.",

I put 7 Tbsp taco seasoning in (I was slowly trying to add it to see how much I needed and it ended up being quite a bit) and then approx 1/2 tsp onion powder. This is a VERY thick soup... almost like a chili-soup. Good with shredded cheese and nacho chips or poured over a baked potato.

Taco seasoning or onion soup mix? No liquid? How is this considered a soup? It's so thick that pasta sauce has more liquid in it. To remedy this entire recipe to make it edible I made the following changes: added fresh onion and cooked with meat. Used taco seasoning since it IS taco soup and not a nacho type topping. Added 2 cans of water from the diced tomato can and used diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of plain tomatoes. This recipe as written--great for nachos or as a dip NOT soup. My version of this recipe? A quick family friendly stew. I'm going to make my changes and resubmit this recipe for publication. Photo is of MY version not as the recipe states.",

As is this is kind of a nice beef/vegetable stew (thicker than a soup I think). I made it almost exactly as written using 85% ground beef a slightly larger can of corn (15.25 oz.) and for the onion soup mix I used another recipe from this site that is supposed to be equivalent to one package of it.
