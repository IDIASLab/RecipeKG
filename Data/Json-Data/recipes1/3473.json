Instead of the half and half cream, I used a can of evaporated skim milk (to kind of cut the fat content). I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, since that was all I had. Also added some frozen corn with the creamed corn & some cubed potatoes and carrots. The carrots gave it a little color and the potatoes I added because a chowder isn't a chowder unless there's potatoes in it! They also thickened it up a little. Finally, I didn't add the cheese into the soup, I served it as a garnish. Overall, a wonderful, filling and comforting dish.",

I double the recipe and start by making a stock (eliminating the need for boullion) by boiling a whole cut up chicken (bone-in breasts will do as well) in about 4c. water with a couple of tb. salt.  After the stock is done, pick the meat from the skin and bones.  Start the onions and garlic and just throw in the pulled chicken when the the onions and garlic are about half done.  Strain the stock with a colander or like utinsel and add back in a cup instead of the boullion!  I add at least 1 or 2 tb. of salt (by taste while cooking) to make up for what is lost by not using boullion.  I also double the creamed corn.  The soup is thicker, the meat is pulled instead of chunked for a more wonderful texture, and the whole thing has a more homemade feel.  An excellent recipe originally or modified!",

I also used diced tomatoes with green chilies and I put in some chopped up canned potatoes. I added a little more hot sauce then suggested. I served it with tostada chips and lots of cilantro. My boyfriend is from mexico and he loved it, he said it was excellent and ate atleast 3 bowls for dinner and had some for breakfast the next morning. This is definitely a keeper. The only thing I would add to it next time is some more hot sauce and and maybe some more chilies.",

Also used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half. Let this reduce and it became a nice thick chowder. This is a chowder and not a soup so expect it to be thicker. Also used shredded chedder and monterrey jack cheese instead of just the monterrey jack. Cannot wait for my husband to  try it.",

The second time, I added a little more chicken, sauted with 1/2c chopped green bell pepper, used a whole can of chicken broth instead of buillon cubes, some whole corn kernals in addition to the creamed corn and a little more cheese. Wonderful. Everyone in my family loves this and I will continue to make this again and again! Thanks so much Jeanne!",
