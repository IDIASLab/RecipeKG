Then top with the remaining whipped cream and some chopped pecans, and ooohhh yummy!  Stand back and listen to the applause!",

I compared it to this one and decided to make this one instead. The only difference was that his suggestsed you layer the cream cheese mixture and the pudding mixture rather than mix them together. Next time I will try layering just for looks but I don't think it will make a difference in the taste. Also his recipie called for only 2 cups of milk which I think I will try next time. 3 cups of milk seemed to make the pudding a little less \"set\". And lastly his recipe called for grated Hershey bar on top instead of pecans. So for next time: Iwould suggest that we try less milk layer more and grate chocolate o the top. Yummy! Thanks",

I found that more time consuming you could not see the separate layer and it'd taste the same mixed together anyway. I like to keep things easiest I guess. Overall this is a great tasting dessert. I thought it'd just taste like chocolate pudding when I was making it but the pecans and other things give it a surprisingly gourmet flavor. Would highly recommend this!!",

I was afraid it might taste boring - like merely pudding on top of a crust but it was delicious! (I had to put some aside so hubby and I could have some!) Everyone loved it and I had to give the recipe to at least 3 people. I told hubby I might try it again with a graham cracker crust but he told me not to change a thing. The only slight problem I had was I think I should've creamed the cream cheese mixture with a mixer before adding it to the pudding mixture. I simply mixed it with a spoon. It made it a little lumpy so I had to put it through a sieve to get the little lumps out. Otherwise perfect!",
