I did not have tomato sauce so I used rose sauce and threw in some fresh tomatoes. I did not have ricotta so I whipped half a cup of sour cream with half a cup of cream cheese. I did not have Ziti so I used radiatore. Other than that I followed the instructions:) The meatballs were tender and it was very creamy. The creamy sauce really cut dow on the acidity of the tomatoes. The meatballs were great. Thanks for the inspiration!",

I also mixed the meatballs in my food processor and added oregano. The meatballs were dry and I was concerned that they would be dry in the ziti but they were suprisingly moist after baking the casserole. Made two smaller casseroles and froze one. A note though I did find the 1 pound ground turkey to be a bit misleading as other recipes specifically ask for cooked turkey.",
