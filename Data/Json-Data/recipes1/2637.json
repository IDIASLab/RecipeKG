Used crm of celery soup. I also cooked up one pkg of brown & serve pork sausage & sliced them up.  Took others advice & mixed it all together.  I'm making this has a side dish for Xmas. Will double the recipe, triple the sauce.  Put one of those new crock pot liner bags in my crock pot and cook on low.  I'm thinking that by using the liner it won't burn on the sides  Wish me luck!!!! Post note: Liner worked beautifully, not dry & didn't burn",
