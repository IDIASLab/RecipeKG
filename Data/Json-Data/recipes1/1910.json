The blend of the milk with sour cream and gelatin gives it a very \"summery\" cool taste. The only thing I would do is to leave out the lime zest; it doesn't go well with the smooth texture. Even still I will make this again. Oh one more thing I used a pre-made graham cracker crust as that's what I prefer with key-lime.",
