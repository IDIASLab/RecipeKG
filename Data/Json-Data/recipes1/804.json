Once the cookies baked they were perfect and sweet.  I did add 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/3 tsp of cinnamon.  It added the perfect amount of spice.  When you are baking the cookies don't over bake them.  The centers will look doughy and the very edges will look lighly brown (this took about 10 minutes). Take them out...they are done.  WAIT 2-4 minutes to take off of the tray (this allows the centers to continue cooking slightly).  I found they did not crumble if you turned them upside down on the cooling rack.  Hope you find these tips helpful.",

And boy am I glad I did.  I halved the recipe, and it still turned out perfectly crispy and airy, despite being an oatmeal cookie.  While baking, they smell fantastic.  But be sure to let the cookies sit for 2 minutes after taking them out of the oven though! Or else they'll crumble all over you.  Truth be told though, not all the dough made it into the oven, lots were consumed in a big bowl of chocolate cookie dough ice cream!",

They baked perfectly for me at 350 for 12 minutes, but are very forgiving - I got busy with my daughter and wasn't able to take the last batch out until nearly 16 minutes, but they were just fine, only a bit crunchier than the others.  \n\nI especially like that these are egg free - my daughter was able to help me make them without me worrying about the raw dough, plus of course they are great for those with allergies.  \n\nFor Berbage, who had the trouble with the cookies spreading thin and not baking properly: it sounds as if your butter/margarine was too soft. \n\nAlso I wanted to add that I never put in the extra quarter cup of white sugar. The 3/4 c of brown sugar is plenty of sweetness here, especially if you're adding raisins or chocolate chips.",

They will most definitely crumble/mush if you try to move them too soon. I only cooked mine for 10 min. and it was perfect for them. They cook a tad more as they sit on the sheet waiting to be transferred. Thanks for this great egg-free recipe!",
