If you follow the receipe without doctoring, you get a stew that is the same color as chicken and rice soup and a taste that is just very plain.  Doctored it up by adding pork tenderloin, BBQ sauce, Frank's Hot Sauce, tomato puree, a can of tomato soup and several other spices becasue it was very bland and just the wrong color.  I would call this a northerner's interpretation of a deeply southern dish.  Get a different recipe if you are looking for a Brunswick stew similar to those served in southern BBQ joints",
