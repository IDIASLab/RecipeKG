Yes I'm from Nawlins myself and this is a good recipe except this way too much roux.That's the amount I use to cook a gumbo for 8-10 people!Try 1/4 that amount and brown it to a light tan color or even darker. Otherwise the end result will be way too floury and thick.  I like to used chopped fresh tomatoes, especially in summer. I also add a little dry white wine. If you don't use Cajun seasonings add salt, black and red pepper to taste.PLUS chopped fresh basil and 1/2-1 tsp thymne. Adjust seasonings to taste after the ingredients have a chance to marry. Put your favorite Cajun Hot Sauce on the table.",
