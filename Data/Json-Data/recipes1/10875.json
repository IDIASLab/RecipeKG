Add salt & pepper cumin and 1 T or so of tahini. A little lemon and parsley to finish. Divine. Really good served with eggs too... hard boiled are more traditional but we also do sunny-side up and poached. The yolky-bean mixture is yummy.",

I always serve the beans in a bowl with pita bread or lavash (paper thin flat bread) on the side to dip in the liquid.  If you don't find fava beans in the supermarket, try a Middle Eastern grocery store.  They are also known as \"foul mudammas\" or \"foul\" (pronounced like 'fool'.)  Yes, the smell during cooking may seem unusual to you at first, but the taste is all its own - and delicious.  Thanks, Beverly, for sharing the recipe with everyone!",
