We used chocolate devils food cake mix instead of white and just put what the box called for instead of the water and egg whites. Other than that we followed the recipe. It wasn't at all messy they were actually very beautiful! Just put a little spoonful of fluff don't cover the cupcake completely. We also pushed in the hersey kiss completely.

I used yellow cake mix instead of french vanilla I filled the cupcake tin about 1/4 full of cake batter added 1tsp graham cracker crumbs the hershey kiss and then pipped about 1 tsp of mashmellow fluff. I then covered all of this with more cake batter. This worked great because some of the fluff raised to the top of the cake and browned on top giving it a real smore taste. I didn't add any more fluff to the top these are really filling and sweet without although I did top some of them with chocolate cream cheese frosting.",

But after the 3rd time around I finally got it. I like the others used the recipe on the box. Didn't put the crumbs on top. Now the trick! Put the fluff in the microwave for 15 seconds stir and put in for another 15 seconds. This makes it so much easier to spread! I used less than a tsp. and it worked wonderful.

For the lady who said the marshmallow stuck to the pan I always took the cupcakes out of the pan before putting the marshmallow on them. It's not necessary to put them back in the oven as the marshmallow will melt overnight anyway. Plus you don't have to put so much graham cracker crumbs all over. These were hard to make the first time but after 3 times it's a lot quicker. They are messy so plan to have plenty of napkins around!!",

I ended up making it 3 different ways because I couldn't make up my mind as to which I would like the best. I made the batter as written with the kiss. After baking I piped marshmallow cream onto several cupcakes and sprinkled with graham crumbs. Then I placed them under the broiler until slightly toasted. I let the other cupcakes cool and then piped some with more marshmallow cream topped with a piece of graham cracker and mini chocolate chips. And finally I topped a few with chocolate frosting marshmallows and a piece of graham. The ones with the toasted marshmallow are by far our favorites. The cupcake part is really good moist and we could definitely taste the graham cracker in it. Overall this was a good recipe one to use some creativity and play around with a little bit. Update: The day after I made these the marshmallow cream had completely run off the cupcakes that I cooled and then added the cream. I would definitely broil the marshmallow cream after adding. Those are still pretty and delicious!",
