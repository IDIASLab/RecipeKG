It was pre-cooked so I skipped boiling it first. I fried the onion with a pinch of salt a grind or two of pepper and a bit of sugar. I let it carmelize deglazing it with water used chicken stock instead of water and bouillon And I had to use diced tomato not tomato sauce. I didn't add any salt except what I put in the onion. The flavor was good but it was more like broth than gravy. Next time I'll add less water/broth.",
