This hit the spot and was exactly what I needed and what I had in mind. I didn't see the need to pound the pork chops to a 1/4\" thickness so just left them as is, about 1/2\" in thickness. This way they were not overly large and it also reduced the chance of overcooking them.  Mindful of Hub's sensitive innards I omitted the red pepper flakes but it wasn't missed. I blanched the tomato in boiling water for about 30 seconds to remove the peel, and didn't bother to measure either the broth or wine.  Just poured in a glug or two of each, reduced it a bit, then swirled in a couple of pats of butter at the end to thicken the sauce and make it silky and smooth.  I served this over sauteed polenta (taking the easy way out and using already prepared polenta) and I'm telling you I was in \"Welcome Home Dinner Nirvana.\"  Great recipe!",
