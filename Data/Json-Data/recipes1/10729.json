                "reviewBody": "LOVE this recipe. The second time I made it I changed a few things to reduce the cakey quality of the cookies. I used wheat flour and allowed it to mix a bit longer to develop the gluten a bit for some chewyness. I used 3/4c of sugar and 3/4c of brown sugar. It made them a bit less crumbly. I liked the difference it made. Also I added 4 bananas for more banana flavor. It didn't really seem to affect the texture of the cookies. Since cookie dough rises but doesn't spread very much make sure you make them small when you put them on the sheet (so the outsides won't burn before they are done). Lastly since I make the cookies small I use mini chocolate chips so that the chocolate distribution is even. I think someone nailed it when they said these cookies taste like banana-chocolate-chip muffin tops which is a big hit with me and my family.",

The second time I made them a little healthier by using 4 tablespoons of butter and 1 cup of applesauce to replace the 1 cup of butter. I used Splenda instead of sugar.
