Ok... because I AM the Queen of taking short cuts (and always in a hurry) here's my take on these! I mixed the dry ingredients in my Kitchen Aide. Blended the softened butter in with the mixer too. Added all other ingreds the way suggested... except... I hand rolled balls of the dough up and put them on a four dusted surface. I rolled them over just to get a dust of flour on them. I took a glass (bottom LIGHTLY dusted in flour) and just squished them flat! I picked them up with a spatula, brushed off any excess flour, put them onto the baking sheet.  I baked them for about 10 min, but I watched them close after 8 min. While they were still warm I glazed them with the glaze from \"Glazed Apple Cream Pie\" (allrecipes.com), and put the traditional holiday sprinkles on them! FAST.... EASY..... AND OHHHHH SO GOOD! :)",

We didn't have cream so I just used whole milk in it's place and it worked just fine and I also increased the vanilla to 2 tsp, but that's a personal preference. Next time I will use cream and I'm sure it will be even better. My son loves to roll dough and cut shapes and this dough was very easy for him to work with. I did chill the dough but I felt it was slightly easier to work with once it was room temperature again. I didn't find this dough to be too dry at all as some reviewers mentioned. I do lightly spoon the flour into a measuring cup rather than dip the measuring cup into the flour which may make a difference in how much flour is used. I also creamed the butter and sugar together as recommended by another reviewer. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!",

You have to give the butter a chance to \"melt\" after you cut it in. At first I thought it was too dry so I got my clean hands in there and kind of kneaded the dough. The heat from my hands melted the butter and in a few minutes it was the perfect consistency. Perfect. Do not add additional cream or anything. Trust me!",

My search is over!  My son & I just made these, but we didn't make cut-outs.  We rolled them into balls then pressed them with a slotted spatula.  (The cookies have raised bars going across them.  Cute!)  They don't spread at all when baking which tells me they'll be superb for cut-outs.  (I can't wait 'til Christmas!!)  Super easy to make and work with.  Light, slightly crisp, melt-in-your-mouth, delicious.  Like others, I thought the dough was a bit dry but I didn't add more liquid.  As we worked with it, it came together beautifully.
