Also I subbed milk for the 2/3 cup of water.(We're trying to fatten up the little ones.) Also I used canned string beans for the veggies.(Again because of the little ones) Fabulous!",

Substituted cream of celery (reduced fat) for cream of chicken. Also used a mixture of white and wild rice for texture.  For vegetables I used 1 small diced onion, frozen green beans, and a mix of frozen diced red & green peppers. (I threw them in to cook a bit with the chicken when it was almost done sauteeing.) Used cubed sauteed chicken breast, dusted with poultry seasoning while cooking. I found this recipe to be a little heavy on the meat for my taste, so I cut back on that. (Actually I cut the whole recipe in half for only 2 people, and used 1 large chicken breast for the meat.) Topped with buttered dry cornbread stuffing mix. This recipe is a great starting point for building a meal more specific to your family's tastes.",
