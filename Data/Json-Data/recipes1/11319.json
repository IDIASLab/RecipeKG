I eyeballed the amount of chopped celery and left out the relish (personal preference). I added a little salt pepper garlic and onion powders. The addition of the hard boiled egg was a nice change.",

I had to add another egg it just needed more and I only used 2 cans of tuna and had to put three times the mayo it was too dry with only the 3 Tbl. I used dried celery in the jar and added some chopped onion per son's request. I was heavy handed with the pickle relish too. This made a good lunch though so thanks for sharing!",

Instead of sweet relish I opted to add dill or sometimes my favorite dill pickels diced up and my other version...Giuliano jalapeno spread ( it's really a relish)! WOW. Or...chili flakes. Let the flavors mesh for several hours or overnight. I've served in a hollowed our red bell pepper. Even diced the tops into the salad. Great on crackers too. Toasted bread is a must! I don't use the egg but I do use Costco's Kirkland Albacore and chill the cans ahead. I keep all in the fridge for fast cool salads or sandwiches. Also another variation....diced cucumbers (persian) dried dill.....the sky is the limit. Even added tabasco at times or lemon juice. Have fun...let the family rate them or have several and give your guests rate them. I did this for an all day bbq as lunch snacks. SoCal so we try to make it healthy. I also use light Best Foods mayo. You can do all the above and also add small shell pasta. Enjoy",
