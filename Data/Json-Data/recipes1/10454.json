A couple of things to consider: 1) it's a great cake even without the salt shortening and cinnamon; 2) for an extra special treat-add Nestle's chocolate chips to the batter...they work their way to the bottom and are a great chocolatey treat when you eat; 3) the frosting is great with pecans or walnuts and is much easier to work with if you put it on while both the frosting and the cake are still warm. You'll love this recipe...it's really delicious!",

It is the perfect birthday cake for a large crowd not to mention that a scoop of vanilla icecream fits right on top!. I do have to say that when I read some of the other reviews that say it is tasteless dry etc.etc. and not just this recipe but others as well I ask you this question... are your ingredients fresh? 2 year old cinnamon and old baking chocolate lose their flavor. Also shortening and vegetable oil that has been sitting in the back of a pantry for a long time gets rancid. So check those spices for freshness and I am sure you will have better results with the wonderful recipes on this website.",
