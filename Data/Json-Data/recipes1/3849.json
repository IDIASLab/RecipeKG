I took it out of the oven 2 minutes early because the top was a beautiful brown and I didn't want to ruin it.  I took it out of the pan (used parchment paper for easy removal) and turned it over. Placed it back into the oven to give the bottom a nice color.  A true Classic tiramisu uses a harder lady finger so I wanted it to be a little firmer. These were perfect!  Thank you for this recipe.

Adding the flour was just weird. It didn't mix well so my first few cookies were just egg tasting. I mixed it more cause I noticed it was clumpy and the second batch was a little more firm. I didn't use a piping bag cause I don't have one so I just spooned then on the cookie sheet. My first impression when I took them out of the oven was \"great I messed it up\" they were very soft almost like making marangue. After cooling for an hour they are now sticky and kind of goowy. They have an interesting texture. I used orange extract instead of vanilla cause I ran out. The taste if good. I don't think I'll make these again though cause I was looking more for a cookie then this. Maybe I just didn't do it right I don't know. Thanks for sharing.",
