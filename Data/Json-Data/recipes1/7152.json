WOW---this is outstanding and I can see where it would be just fine as a company dish. I'm going to try cream of roasted garlic and potato soup next time!!",

Mixed it all together and sprinkled savory seasoning garlic onion powder lots of pepper and mix and then pour into my prebaked regular pie crust. I then flipped over my second thawed out pie crust on top and made some slits on the top and baked I don't like dark crust so i covered my edges with tin foil. Tip; cook in the regular pan the crust come in and place a lined cookie sheet with tin foil underneath then place pie in center of foiled pan and bring foil up around the edges for perfect crust and no clean up or extra dishes Hip Hip Hooray!",

I used leftover chicken thigh meat and for the veggies I used carrots (fresh) peas (frozen) leftover boiled new potatoes and chopped shallots. I only wish I had pre-sauteed the carrots and the shallots since they weren't quite as done as I would have liked. I also added pepper and ground savory (poultry seasoning would work as well) and the flavor was heavenly. This is going to be a staple in our house for many years to come. Thanks Terry!",

My only recommendation is to make sure you season your chicken well and possibly add a bit of seasoning you love to the cream cheese mix. Otherwise it can be a bit bland. I think the suggestion to cut the cream chese is crazy - this is what makes this dish creamy and better than the same old pot pie.",
