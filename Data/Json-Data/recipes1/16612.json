Didn't think about that until after I mixed with the other ingredients...salad shrimp probably would have been best. Do let the dressing meld with the shrimp mix because when tasting it in the beginning rather salty. But does go away when chilled for several hours. Made this for my daughter and she reall liked it. But did ask that I make again with more tomatoes too. As well as smaller shrimp.",

Several people said to use the smaller salad shrimp for this but I enjoy the flavor and texture of the larger shrimp so just cut each shrimp into thirds and it made the pieces similar to the other ingredients and soaked up more dressing that way.
