Also, it never makes 26 of the regular size muffins pans. So today, I finally got the ratios right so it makes 24 tarts/muffins. I did 1.5 of the recipe for the filling (3 pkgs cream cheese; 3/4 c. sugar; 3 eggs, 1.5 tsp vanilla and 1.5 tsp lemon juice. There is no need to increase the base/crust. Each muffin uses 1 tbsp of crumb mixture and just under 1/4 c. of cream cheese filling. The pie filling was just the right amount. Yum. I get requests to make these all the time!",

You certainly can do it this way but you will make @ 48 of them. You can only fit about two cherries on top doing it this way. They were still a very cute little dessert. Next time I will try them in full-size muffin cups. It took some patience to get the graham cracker crust to stay up and around the cupcake liners.",
