We don't do the egg white mixture - just put the sprinkles on and they stick once baked. To make the dough cool enough to work with without waiting overnight we wrap it in wax paper and put it in the freezer for a while. My daughter is gluten free and I've even made ours with gluten free flour (I used a mix that's \"all purpose\" from Wegman's but the Bob's Red Mill works as well). This year when we rolled them out I used coconut flour and they came out just like the regular ones. Last year we used the all purpose mix and when they baked they puffed up instead of staying thin.",
