Well, you should have seen the look on his face when I made these tacos and they tasted EXACTLY like the ones we had eaten there!!  Not bad for a gringo!! :-)\r\n\r\nI've tweaked the recipe a little - I buy really thinly cut pieces of meat and then cut them into small cubes (that's the way they do it at the restaurants I've had this dish in) and then I  marinate the beef in some lime juice and salt and pepper first. I also cook the onions and pepper for a few minutes before adding the beef and cilantro and leave some raw for garnish. I also make the pico de gallo recipe on this site to serve with it. It's also not bad served with flour tortillas if you want to avoid the oil from frying the corn tortillas.",

                "reviewBody": "Being from the Northeast I never ate much Mexican but when I briefly lived in the Midwest I learned to make these sort of tacos. The locals called them tortillas but I later found out the tortilla was just the corn wrapping and not the name of the dish. We made them with all the usual taco fillings like seasoned hamburg lettuce and tomato onions cheese sour cream and taco sauce. The secret is the soft corn tortilla that you do not fry until it is crunchy but rather until it is limp and pliable. It frys very fast. Plop one at a time in the hot oil. It will puff up then turn it. When it puffs again remove it immediately to drain the oil on a paper towel. The dish known as soft tacos is usually made with the already soft flour tortilla. I way love these soft corn tortillas better than those and the crunchy corn type.",

At first I was worried about the jalapeno being too hot (first time making authenic mexican food) but it wasn't at all. The lime was delicious and we added cumin and a touch of garlic salt when frying the meat. I get compliments from everyone that I serve this to..who KNOWS how authentic mexican food should taste like---that would be my in-laws. Flour tortillas sour cream and chi chi's salsa have no place in a dish like this. Serve with Goya Arroz con Frijoles Negros y Coronas.",

My former neighbors had a housekeeper from Central America and these are very much like the tacos she made for us except she made the corn tortillas by hand without a press even! Do try to get the highest quality top sirloin that you can find - it does make a difference. I recommend Whole Foods Market all-natural beef if you have a store in your area. They are a little more expensive but it is worth it for the taste and tenderness. Also if you don't like hot food remove all the seeds and veins from the peppers before you chop them. That's where most of the heat comes from. The only thing that I did differently was like another reviewer I marinated the sliced steak with a little fresh squeezed lime salt and pepper for about 10 or 15 minutes (just long enough to have a Corona) before I seared it then added a little more salt and pepper after cooking. Also coated my cast iron skillet with a tiny amount of oil just enough to prevent sticking. Lola thanks so much for sharing this!!!",

And I cooked my onions with the steak and then tossed the steak & onions w/the salt pepper and lime juice in a bowl and let it sit in the fridge for half an hour. The steak just cooked in oil by itself did not have much taste. Also I added shredded cheddar cheese and put homemade guacamole in my taco. Next time and I WILL make it again it was yummy I will use flank steat b/c the cut the recipe calls for is so much more expensive.

I wasn't able to find corn tortillas so I purchased flour instead. I was SCARED of the jalapenos (I DON'T like hot food... rather I can't eat hot food comfortably) but they were fantastic! The lime and cilantro are the keys to the flavor in my opinion and since I love both I added a little extra on my tacos then my husband's. I also couldn't help myself but purchased a 5 layer \"Mexican\" party dip that had salsa cheese sour cream guacamole and diced tomatoes and added 2 spoonfuls to top off the tacos. Just wonderful! Met and exceeded my requirements for a weekday family meal which are easy to make YUMMY and fast to cook! My Texan husband was quite pleased with them so I take that as a sign that these are up to par.:) I definitely will be making this again in the very near future.",
