I beat 8 teasp. meringue powder with 1/2 cup water (equaling 4 egg whites) instead of using the egg whites because the whites weren't being cooked (I'll simply use those whites in an omelette or cake).I reduced the sugar added to the egg whites to 1/2 cup because this made for a lightly sweetened filling. The recipe didn't specify what form of p'fruit juice so I chose Goya brand 100% pure \"Fruit Pulp\" ( available in the freezer section of Latin & some regular grocery stores). Because this wonderfully strong flavored fruit pulp (which is really more of a puree) doesn't have added sugar & thus is very tangy I added 2 Tblsp. sugar to make it more like a juice. (Use the frozen fruit juice concentrate only as a last resort as it is super sweet & with a minimal p'fruit taste.) I made my own pastry crust adding ground macadamia nuts to further elicit the flavors of Hawaii. Lastly I cooked 2 thick syrups of pomegranate & of p'fruit to drizzle over the plated slices. Beautiful jewel tones! This was an easy pie to make.",
