I have never had so many compliments and it's so simple to make.  It's so versatile that I made a double batch and used part to frost a cake and then we frosted sugar cookies.  I do recommend making sure that you are beating it long enough so as to eliminate lumps of any kind and if your powdered sugar is lumpy, I would sift it before adding to the mixture.  All and all- a most excellent recipe!",

Kris, you are a saint!  I've searched and created many a frosting and this one you posted is the most brilliant.  What I love most about this frosting is its versitality.  I use butter instead of marg, and I only use 3.5 cups of powdered sugar since my people don't like it too sweet.  You can drip in more milk to create a fluffy effect or reduce the milk to make a thicker version.  \r\n\r\nThank you, Kris for posting a frosting that is a perfect compliment to cake.

And yes, this really does taste like the kind of frosting on bakery cakes.  One hint.  If you have some, add about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of butter extract.  Purists might argue against it, but if you're looking for \"bakery\" taste, the butter extract will take it a step closer.  Also, I found that this recipe worked best with my KitchenAid.  I whipped the frosting for about 5 minutes.  Without the KitchenAid, I might not have had the patience.",

The key to getting the right consistency with any icing is to only add enough milk to reach desired consistency not the WHOLE amount as listed in any recipe.  The amount of humidity in the air will affect your icing as sugar is hydroscopic (absorbs water).",
