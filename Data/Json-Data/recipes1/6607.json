I made several of these pie fillings, stacked them in the deep freeze, and we have enjoyed \"fresh\" peach pie all year long! Pretty special - and SO convenient! The only comment is that the pie often needed to cook quite a lot longer than the recipe indicated (sometimes 2+ hours). When baking, I wait until the filling makes slow bubbles that do not burst- just like with any pie. This recipe is a GREAT idea!",

So in all fairness to the recipe submitter the consistency problem was due to the substitution of ingredients and cooking method not the recipe itself. I do hope the reviewer tries this again and follows the recipe; I am certain she will be as pleased with the results as I was. In fact I am off to my kitchen to prepare another pie right now.",

So I chopped up a mango peach and apriums (Apparently a cross between apricots and plums--don't worry if you've never heard of them as neither had I until hubs brought them home)and proceeded with the recipe minus the freezing. I didn't really know what the recipe submitter was talking about with the ascorbic acid and was too lazy to find out so I made this without it. Hubs really liked the result and kept asking me what fruits were in it. While warm the filling was rather runny but the cooled filling thickened right up and was the perfect amount for a single pie.
