Only thing I changed was the salsa, I used Chi-Chi's Salsa which was pretty darn tasty. The only problem I had was when I was tossing the seasoning mix with the chicken some of it ended up stuck to my fingers so next time I might add more to compensate for sticky fingers!\n\nOverall was a pretty great dish, easy to prep, make, and the taste was right on! Definitely saving this recipe for a later date.",

I used 1.5lb. and I thought the amount of chicken compared the the rest of hte ingredients wasn't enough. The combination of the taco seasoning and italian dressing was delicious! My boyfriend and kids told me that I could have just served the chicken and they would have been thrilled. I used about 4 tablespoons of dressing and a whole packet of seasoning. I also put in plain diced tomatoes in addition to the salsa.\nMost of my meals are from scratch and the family has really loved my dinners lately but last night I was told that this was the best dinner in a long time. So, this will earn a permanant spot in my dinner ideas.",
