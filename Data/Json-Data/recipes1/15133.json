All of that was fine.  I also used two tbsp oil instead of one, that was a mistake, too greasy.  I baked them for 20 minutes at 425 and cranked up the oven to 450 and watched them for another couple minutes - took them out when the edges on two or three started to burn.  Whoever said the cheese was the only thing crispy about these... I had that experience also.  #1 change these need is something to crisp them up on the outside.  I didn't have to turn them, although maybe that would have helped.  Cutting them thinner (more like shoestrings than pub fries) might have helped too - the thinner ones seemed a bit crisper.  The flavor was good though.  They're just a little sweet, which is nice.  No, they don't taste just like potato fries.  Soy milk doesn't taste just like dairy milk, and veggie burgers don't taste just like beef burgers.  I like these things for what they are, not how much they do or don't taste like something else, but to each their own.  If you're looking for potato fries, try potatoes; but if you don't mind something a little different, give these a go.",

I am not sure exactly what happened to mine but the only part that was really 'crispy' was the cheese. The cheese started to burn a bit. Also, I grew up with Scotland relatives and to them, a turnip is what we call a rutabaga. I did use turnip but next time I think I might try rutabaga to see how that tastes. I dipped mine in light sour cream with a dash of dill. The spices used in this recipe are really good. Thanks",

I cut them thinly to try to get them extra crispy but after cooking them for more than 20 minutes they were still droopy. But still, very very tasty! I didn't use the tablespoon of oil though, instead I sprayed pam into the bag to coat the turnips while going easy on the fat.  This was my first time eating turnips. Even if I can never get these fries crispy- this is still a new favorite. Who knew turnips were tasty!",
