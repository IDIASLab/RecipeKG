This recipe is a keeper. I also switched vanilla for the almond (nut allergies in the family). Doubled the recipe and made cut out hearts for Valentine's Day. They held their shape beautifully. I did have to bake them quite a bit longer though almost 20 min in order to get them lightly golden around the bottom edge.",

I know you can add to this looks like most people added sugar or something. But at least these should TASTE good all by themselves and sadly....they don't. They don't cut out well and we ended up using a press to shape and cut with a knife. Very disappointing.",

To my dismay I didn't have access to a mixer so I attempted to make them entirely by hand. From creaming the butter to mixing in the flour it was definitely work. Following the baking time as listed yielded cookies slightly too doughy for my taste so I up-ed the baking time to get the crunch/softness that I preferred. The flavor was tasty and subtle - perfect for icing. I will make again & again in the future... but definitely with a mixer.",
