A very satisfying dish if you crave German flavor that's Americanized. We love this dish served on potato rolls with spicy hot German mustard, Swiss cheese, and ice cold beer on the side.",

This was pretty good but in the future I would reduce the brown sugar to 1 tsp and maybe even throw the brats on the grill briefly to get some grill marks on them. In my opinion the sauerkraut will yield 4 servings not 6 particularly if you serve the brat on the top of it. Certainly was quick to make and will be made again.",

I, like the author, was always looking for beer brats with more of a beer flavor, and this is definitely it! The only changes I made was omitting the onion powder for grilled onions and browning the brats for a few minutes. I also transferred everything to a foil pan and baked it for 10-15 mins. at 350 degrees to let the flavors meld a little. Served it with a little jalapeno mustard on the side and it was a huge hit with the guys that came over for football. Will file this one away for future use.",

Also use a hearty beer not a light beer and you should let it sit open for awhile before cooking so it gets flat.",

First I did not find caraway seeds at the grocery store but the flavor turned out amazing without it. I also just browned the brats on a large skillet and transferred them to a baking dish with the beer sauce and baked them. In another baking dish I added 2 large ladles of the beer sauce and the sauerkraut and baked it for 10 minutes. I just served the sauerkraut and brats together. The sauce was not thick like a syrup but it had a great consistency and it was delicious. Everyone raved about it and wanted seconds.",
