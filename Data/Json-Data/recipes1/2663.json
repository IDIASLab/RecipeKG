I\u2019ve tried making this recipe using both milk and water as I\u2019ve made this glaze many times already\u2026 I definitely have found that the makes it taste much better. As some of the other reviewers found, using the milk DOES make the finish somewhat matte, but it still looks great and tastes even better with milk. It works wonderful with food coloring too. I put this glaze on the \u201cBest Rolled Sugar Cookies\u201d from this site and WOW, what a combo!!! People go nuts when they try these cookies. Just dip the cookie face-down in this glaze and twist, place on a piece of waxed paper and let sit for a couple hours. Make another bowl of this glaze in a contrasting color, take a spoon and drizzle it over the cookie for a neat effect too. Dries nice and hard! GREAT RECIPE! I\u2019ve used it time and time again!!",

I think it would work out better to add more powdered sugar to thicken it up a little.  I thickened it up a whole lot after I was done glazing the cookies and put it into a frosting bag with a fine round tip ( I also added food color ) and I piped on the details I wanted and this turned out great!  I also added a little vanilla to it because I found it to be a little bland as is.  I think next time, also, I'll try it with milk instead of water.\n\nUpdate:  I thickened it quite a bit this time, but it was still flowy enough to dip the cookies and this worked out much better.  It coated them better and it dried clearer and shinier.  Also, I put it in a glass pie plate so I could fit some of my bigger cookies in there.  I still just used water; didn't try it with milk in the glaze.  Lastly, I do double the recipe, otherwise it's not enough and do stir the glaze before dipping each cookie.",
