I still used about 1/4 cup onion about a teaspoon of garlic and LOTS of cajun seasoning which had cayenne pepper and other spices in it. Salt & pepper to taste. I used 1 can each of black beans and kidney beans. It still made PLENTY. I did add about 1/4 water and a little 'juice' from the black beans since other reviewers said it was dry. I'm glad I did. It was tasty and I think it will taste even better as leftovers. This was easy to modify to my taste don't be afraid to experiment.",

Also please cut WAY down on the rice as that amount of raw will give you 3/4 GALLON of cooked rice!!",
