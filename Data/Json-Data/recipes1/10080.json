I used 2 granny smith and 2 gala apples to balance the tart and sweet, poured only about 1/2 the maple syrup on top of the apples (didn't mix, it all blends when baking).  I would use a little more if using all granny smith, less if using sweeter apples.  For the topping, I cut the butter in half, and added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  It was DIVINE served warm with vanilla ice cream.  Had a subtle taste of maple without being overpoweringly sweet.  Threw out my old apple crisp recipe on the spot.",

Adding maple syrup to apple crisp - outstanding idea. Subjecting the syrup to prolonged high temperatures . . . not so. Maple products lose their flavor at high temperatures, which is why it takes so long to make the syrup - the boil must be controlled in the low 200 degree region. Made as posted, there was barely a hint of maple flavor. I made it a second time (see custom recipe) and it was much better. When cooking with genuine maple syrup, low and slow is the way to go.",
