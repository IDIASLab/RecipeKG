It goes by many names and has many variations --chocolate pumpkin etc.(see Paula Deen's recipes on FoodNetwork). Don't overbake this! The word \"cake\" is deceiving so when you bake this don't think something's wrong when it stays gooey--that's exactly how it's supposed to be. It is a soft gooey bar-like dessert that while tasty was much too sweet for my liking. It was okay but after making this in '99 I didn't consider it a \"keeper \" and I never made it again.",
