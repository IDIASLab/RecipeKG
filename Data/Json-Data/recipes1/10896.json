I wasn't sure it would really turn into a casserole.  But it came out great.  Tasty, very filling, and it makes a LOT.  Would be a great dish for feeding a large group.\nI followed the recipe, but added an extra cup of cheese to the sauce mixture. I used non-fat sour cream. I also added some chopped red bell pepper, some cooked and chopped up sausage, (veggie sausage that is - 1 pkg MorningStar Farms brand veggie sausage patties,)and one bag frozen broccoli florets.\nI was very good, and the FF onions, (which I almost omitted, since they don't seem much like a real food item to me) actually add some great texture and flavor.",

After finding this recipe and making this many many times now I make the following changes: brown a pound of 93/7 hamburger seasoned with garlic powder pepper and half an onion; no grease to drain! I brown an entire bag of crispy crowns instead of regular tots. I layer the hamburger meat over the crispy crowns then spread the soup mixture which incorporates the top reviewer's suggestion to add more sharp cheddar than called for some French fried onions and I also season the mixture with additional spices to my liking (garlic & onion powders a little paprika and pepper). I also use the Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup and the entire 16 oz container of sour cream. It's thick and creamy and using the back of a spoon it spreads easier than you think. So what if the hamburger is mixed in? Top that with some additional cheese and bake 35-40 minutes at 350. 1-2 minutes before it's done I sprinkle a few more French fried onions on the top and turn the oven to broil. After taking it out let it sit for 10 minutes. Perfection! Now if only my husband would let me add some green beans to the mix....",
