In my opinion, it's the perfect chocolate cake. I don't have any of the problems other's have mentioned. I'm sure the problems are not with the recipe but it's that something is being done wrong.  Make sure to measure your ingredients correctly. NEVER EVER scoop flour, you have to spoon it into a level measuring cup and level it off. Scooping leads to too much flour in the cake which equals dry, crumbly..ect.. Be sure to level off the baking soda as well..If you taste baking soda in the cake you probably used too much. Cream the butter and sugar WELL. You cannot substitute the buttermilk in this recipe with regular milk UNLESS you add a tbs of lemon juice or white vinegar to it. Beat eggs in one at a time, mixing each one in completely. When alternately adding flour and milk, start and end with the flour. Also, DON'T OVERBAKE. ",

I followed the recipe exactly but they cooked in only 10 minutes. I iced them with red white and blue butter cream icing. I think the best tip for chocolate cake is to be sure to watch the time carefully. If you over-bake it the results are dry and bland. If you time it right this cake is perfect! My husband absolutely loved it! I will use this recipe from now on as my basic chocolate cake! Thanks for sharing!",
