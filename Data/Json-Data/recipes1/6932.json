A couple of notes...don't use all of the milk for the glaze!  WAY TOO MUCH!  Start with just a couple of tbsp, and work your way up until you get a good drizzling consistancy.  Also, I found it impossible to add the fudge filling without touching the sides of the pan...but it turned out fine.  Just make sure that your pan is well greased and floured.  Cake would also be good without the fudge filling.  Nice and dense!",

Adding a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side does wonders as well!",

I would use vanilla pudding with white chocolate chips or maybe butterscotch pudding with butterscotch chips and I'd use a different type of glaze on top. For me and my husband the cake was pure chocolate and for us it was way to rich and powerful. I took this cake to a church activity and it was gobbled up... apparently there are a lot of dark chocolate lovers at my church. So if you like dark chocolate - this cake is for you. If not I'd say it's a good idea to try your own ideas - like I will do next time using white chocolate... Tunnel of White Chocolate Fudge - I like the sound of that!",
