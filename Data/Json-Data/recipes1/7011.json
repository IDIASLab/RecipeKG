After all the liquid was absorbed added the breadcrumbs and some salt and served up with some parmesan shavings for extra flavour. Disappeared really fast so must've done something right;) Thanks for the original receipe - great way to do kale!",

It reduces so much that you really do need at least 1/2 lb. to get one adult serving. 2) Use a LARGE saute pan or skillet, as the kale needs a lot of surface area to stir fry. If you prepare it in a Dutch oven or a small pan that forces you to pile the kale up, you will not get rid of the water and the kale will saute instead of stir frying. 3) Wilt the kale for no more than 5 minutes. 4) Most Important: Use fewer bread crumbs, and remove the bread-crumb coated onions before adding the kale.  Once the kale has stir-fried, put it in a serving dish and add the onions on top.  It is a nicer presentation, because loose bread crumbs spread over the kale and make it appear less appetizing.  I've never been able to keep the bread crumbs on the onions if I keep them in the pan while I fry the kale. 5) Try this with the Cajun Style Baked Sweet Potato.",

I removed the thick rib in the middle of the kale and chopped it up. Then boiled it x 10 min.

Then put the boiled drained kale in the olive oil/onion mixture with salt and pepper and it was really good. Even people who thought they did not like kale enjoyed it this way.",
