ADD some HERBS DE PROVENCE when cooking the mushrooms and artichokes - it is the perfect spice and compliments the delicate flavors of the wine and mushrooms, bringing out the natural flavors sweetly with a lovely country herb taste. If you want to really enjoy the dish to its fullest, I recommend a few sprinkles of Herbs de Provence to round out this mature, delicious dish. (Also, it went well over orzo as prepared in the Orzo with Parmesan and Basil recipe, and with some steamed asparagus.)",

I chopped 6 boneless, skinless thighs into bite sized pieces, added 5 cloves minced garlic and 3 chilies de arbol to the butter & oil, saute'd and then set aside.  I used sherry instead of white wine and just to be sure I put a spoonful (just before the final step) in a bowl and tasted it with and without heavy cream - ADD THE CREAM!  The cream adds to the presentation as well.  After I added the capers I added 1 cup or 1/2 pint of heavy cream and served over white rice.  It was fabulous!  Even my boyfriend, who isn't a fan of artichokes, LOVED it and scarfed it up like there was no tomorrow.",

                "reviewBody": "I actually did not try this recipe yet. It is similiar to one that I have had for years and have enjoyed.  Some differences that people may want to incorporate to address the blandness are as follows:  Saute the bnls chix (in strips) in a little butter and some white wine.  In a separate pan heat 1 13 oz can of artichoke hearts (I use packed in water), juice of 1/2 lemon and 1/2 lime, 1 13oz can of peeled and diced tomatoes, and some nice herbs (parsley, shallots, chives, pepper) and some garlic.  The other difference is I have always served over rice.  I love the basmati rice.  The acid from the lemon, lime, and tomato really perks up the dish.  Hope it helps.  I actually originally got this recipe from a very nice restaurant I worked in during college (a lifetime ago!!).",

I tried it out on my husband and my friend last night my friend already called me today for the recipe! I added lots of minced garlic, salt, and pepper to the recipe. I also used some cornstartch to thicken the sauce and I  chopped up the chicken after I browned it and I used a full carton of mushrooms. I served it over buttered and salted fusilli then topped with fresh parmasean...YUM!",

I also sauteed the chicken with some garlic and wine. I used low carb chardonney. I used 18 oz. of artichokes and 8 oz of sliced mushrooms. I also only used 3 chicken breasts. Altered the capers to 2 Tbls. I also used alot of herbs de provence to flavor the chicken. I then added some lemon and lime to the sauce to give it more tang. THe sauce wasn't thick enough and I didn't want to use cornstarch due to the carbs so I used some heavy whipping cream being careful to make sure the sauce wasn't to acidic to curdle. I put the mixture for the boys over bowtie pasta. It was a hit and will definately make again was definately restaurant quality! Thanks!!!!!",

The \"sauce\" has to boil down for considerably longer than it takes the chicken to cook to get to the right consistency, especially if eating with pasta.  The overall sauce is extremely sour between the artichoke marinade the white wine and the capers.  I smoothed it out with some heavy whipping cream and thickened it with a bit of cornstarch.  Next time, saute some shallots in with the artichokes & mushrooms to sweeten the sauce further.",
