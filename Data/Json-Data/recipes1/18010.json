In fact I used two cans of the coconut milk to the one can of cream of coconut and I feel it was too sweet. I will make this again but will try using three cans of coconut milk to the one can of coconut cream. I made this recipe without an ice cream maker. I mixed the ingredients in a large bowl let it sit over night in the frig then stirred it and placed in the freezer with some plastic wrap covering the bowl. I then pulled it out of the freezer every 30 to 60 minutes to stir for the next 5 hours. I melted the chocolate and drizzled a little at a time putting the ice cream back into the freezer (for 10 minutes) after each addition. This allowed the chocolate to become hard and break up when I stirred it into the ice cream. I did this until I added enough chocolate (I added 3 ounces). I then transferred the ice cream into a plastic bowl with a lid and put it back into the freezer until after dinner. The final product was good but too sweet for me. I will try again...",

I did add about 1/2 c. of sugar because the coconut milk is unsweetened and the mix tasted bitter before I added the sugar. Now that the ice cream has been in the freezer it is nearly impossible to scoop and has a lot of ice crystals. Hard as a rock. The way the chocolate is drizzled in also causes big deposits of chocolate which basically turn to rocks in the freezer. Will not be making this again. Quite disappointing once it's frozen.",
