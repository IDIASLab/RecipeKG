Used oriental ramen instead of chicken and since I like lots of dressing added the mandrin juice to the mix. If you double this recipe make sure you have a seriously huge bowl. I made this for an office dinner and while I loved it no one really said much so.......4 stars. As a leftover the noodles and cashews get soft but it's still very good. I'm planning on making this for Thanksgiving for my more sweet-toothed family. And can anyone tell my why you must use white wine vinegar instead of plain 'ol white vinegar? If anyone is interested a single recipe of this salad cost about 7.00.",

I took it to a family reunion today & got many requests for the recipe & I come from a family of very good cooks! I made a few changes--I left out the cashews and added 3 tablespoons of toasted sesame seeds 1/2 cup of toasted sliced almonds and 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro. I used the oriental flavor ramen mix which gave the dressing a delicious taste--similar to the dressing from a restaurant's Asian salad. You definitely do not need to soak the ramen noodles first unless you plan to serve the salad immediately after making it. I defintely plan to make this salad again for summer potlucks and as a main dish for my family with the addition of cooked chicken or shrimp. Awesome recipe!!",

But the first time out I did follow the recipe. While doing that I also felt with all the flavoring packets that came with the noodles it made the mixture a bit too salty for my taste. So the second time around I used 1/2 a packet. Next time I might lessen the sugar and eliminate the sunflower seeds. Thanks Louise for sharing your delicious recipe!",
