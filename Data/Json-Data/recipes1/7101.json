I was looking for a pie to use up a pre-made chocolate graham cracker crust and was able to pull the rest of the ingredients from stuff I had on hand. I substituted whipped topping for the whipped cream and I reduced the amount of sugar by 1/4c to compensate for the sweetness of the whipped topping. I will make this again but next time I will reduce the sugar by at least another 1/4c. This is a very sweet rich pie so if you are serving to guests think small slices;-).",
