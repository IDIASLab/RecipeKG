I had a fresh pineapple that was about 2 weeks old and in need of being used it. Wt. was 4 oz. on my kitchen scale once I got it cut up. It was not real juicy and since recipe stated to use undrained pineapple I just threw it in my food processor and rough cut. Did add 1 tsp. vanilla and used 1:1 brown/white sugar. The pineapple was very sweet and even with the 1 cup total sugar it was not sickening sweet. Very full flavor of pineapple. If using canned I think I would use pineapple tidbits. I did add 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and could not taste the cinnamon really. I suppose that is a good thing as it did not overpower the flavor of the pineapple.",
