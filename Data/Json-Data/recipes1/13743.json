The allusive nutmeg and lemon juice flavors make this a hit (not to mention the richness of the sauce that doesn't feel as heavy as the ingredients would suggest). The flour/lemon juice mix was very thick so I added hot liquid from the pot. Also I followed suggestion of other reviewer and added bay leaf thyme garlic and carrots but not potatoes. great recipe for cold wet days. yummm",
