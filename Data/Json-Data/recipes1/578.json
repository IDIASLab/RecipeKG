They were for a going away party at work and they were gone before the end of the day - wonderfully yummy, many people asked me for the recipe. Since then I have tried many experiments. This recipe is extremely flexible; you can really fun with it. So far my favorite way is to use about 1/4 cup more peanut butter (I now use natural and it makes a tasty difference,) I also use a mix of milk chocolate and peanut butter chips. They come out tasting like a confection. I have also discovered that this dough can be refrigerated, you can cut off a cookie or two or three at a time, bake and enjoy! Way better and cheaper then the pre-packaged ready to bake cookies.\r\n\r\nThank You for sharing this with us!!!",

Very rich and chewy, but for those who thought they did not have much flavor, my suggestion would be to add 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/4 tsp. salt and just make sure you take them out of the oven when the middles look underdone but the outside just starts to turn brown. Let them cool a minute and they firm up fast.",

They came out of the oven and after they were cool enough to eat without burning my mouth I tried one. It was completely flavorless except for the chocolate chips...no cookie taste at all. After sitting for a while I thought I'd try another one since I read a review saying they tasted better after sitting. I would have to agree that there was a little more flavor after sitting. However I feel that nothing beats eating a cookie fresh out of the oven so I won't be making these again.",
