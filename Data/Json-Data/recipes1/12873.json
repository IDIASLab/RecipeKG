A tip if you're using the microwave-- keep an eye on it and stir a little bit partway through to keep smooth. I've also used fat-free condensed milk, which made no difference to the recipe.

The fudge didn't set even when I froze it. I realize I  added too much milk! So I melted everything again and added more chocolate. This time it set up just the way it should! Delicious!!! I recommend storing these in an air-tight container coz if left in the fridge just wrapped in foil, the fudge will absorb the odor of other food.",

My only possible critique was that I feel it used a little too much vanilla extract, so I'll probably only put in  1.5 tsp next time. But there will definitely be a next time. :) EDIT: I made this a second time with raspberry-chocolate chips and it came out just as well. I only used one tsp of vanilla and probably could've used none. Just a really good recipe.",
