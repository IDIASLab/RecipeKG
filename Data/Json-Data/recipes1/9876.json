While my Mom sold the products she would go to the houses where the party was hosted and cook this. Making this again brought back some great memories. I'm a vegetarian now so I used Worthington's Wham (which is so much like ham that it's quite creepy). I also used yellow onion instead of green. Be careful when putting the cresent roll in a ring. If you overlap them too much the thick spots will not cook all the way through. While shopping for cresent rolls I recommend reading the nutritional facts and try to find the one with the least trans fat (all have it but some have minimal amounts).",
