I went heavy on the garlic and I used the entire packet of onion soup mix (by accident). It didn't hurt the flavor at all (just gave us more sodium than we needed!)...oh well. I used cream/chicken soup instead of mushroom just because we prefer it. I also threw in a couple dollops of sour cream and a splash of half & half just because. This dish was VERY tasty and I will make it again.",

Other than that I followed the recipe as written. One thing I would suggest is to add and mix in the italian seasoning with the soup mixture before adding it to the chicken because otherwise all the seasoning sticks to the chicken and we didn't like that. Good-tasting recipe overall though.",
