But the best part of this recipe is that it TASTES GOOD. I mean it REALLY tastes good. Admittedly, I was really hungry. And admittedly, I was looking for something spicy and interesting--not the same low-fat, low-cal routine. And man, Amy, this fit the bill and then some. Thankfully, I doubled the recipe so I can eat these delicous burgers for the next week or more. I thought there might be too many red pepper flakes for my taste, but the bite was just right. I'm a condiment freak and I couldn't bear to even consider putting ketchup and mustard on these. I used whole wheat buns, a fresh garden tomato, onion and a few dill slices and with a little Mexican Bean Stew on the side (also available on the allrecipes website), this was a Tex-Mex flavored meal fit for a king.",

Pile with lettuce tomato onions cheese and a little BBQ sauce on a multi-grain roll for something that'll pass for a Ruby Tuesday-type burger! I will make this again but try the combo without turkey and mince with fresh shucked quahogs for stuffed quahogs on the half shell. Or I'll do it with tofu for a spicy vegetarian burger. I will also use the seasoning-cracker combo with shredded imitation crabmeat for crab cakes (just double the amount of cracker crumbs and add a little melted butter). Thanks for the recipe Amy!",
