I order lemon chicken quite a bit at Chinese restaurants and this recipe doesn't come out as expected. I made the recipe without any changes and was disappointed. My chicken was edible but not lemon chicken. As I suspected the sherry in the marinade was too strong overpowered the delicacy of the lemon and was generally out of place in the recipe. The batter was lovely but pretty unsuitable for the recipe unless sauced very lightly at the last minute (anything else and such a light batter loses its crunch). Hence the sauce should be made first then fry the chicken and drizzle sauce over hot chicken. Lastly the sauce was lovely but other reviewers are right the lemons shouldn't be added until the last minute. I'll definitely make this recipe again but this time with changes.",
