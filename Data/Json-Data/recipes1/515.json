Increased peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups, added an additional 1/4 cup flour, baked at 350 degrees for 9-10 minutes.  After forming the dough into balls, I dipped them in sugar and with sugar side up, gently created a criss-cross pattern on top.  The cookies are well balanced--crispy edges, chewy centers.  Delicate peanut butter flavor.  My whole family loved them!!",

I made 2 dozen cookies with them and they were a hit. I made them super soft and gooey. Pull them out of the oven even when they are soft, and let them cool, they will be just the right crispiness on top but soft on the inside. I think I baked my cookies for about 6 or 7 minutes. \n\nGood luck and enjoy!",

I added 1 tsp. of vanilla and, because I like my peanut butter cookies very peanut buttery, an additional cup of peanut butter. Just for something a little different I threw in a package of chocolate/peanut butter swirl chips. Because the dough is made with butter, chill the dough till somewhat firm and you won't end up with thin cookies...no need to add more flour!",

                "reviewBody": "Ok, to start, the flavor of these cookies is phenomenal. Absolutely delicious.  The problem is, you definitely should make these cookies a couple of times before you plan on taking them to any parties. My first try resulted in underdone peanut butter pancakes, and overdone peanut butter frisbees. The cookies flattened out literally to be about an eighth of an inch thick. Not cool. They also spread so wide, that I had beautiful octagonally shaped cookies after I had cut them all apart. After shoving the dough back into the fridge for few days due to frustration, I tried again, and discovered a few changes that make for better cookies. They still don't look like the ones in the picture, but oh well. For one, cool the dough longer than an hour. Three days is perhaps a bit long, but definitely give it a good, solid amount of time in the fridge. Next, don't squish the balls done with a fork. The melting butter and peanut butter doesn't need any help going flat. There aren't any cute fork imprints, but after your cookie has turned into a manhole cover, you don't see the fork marks anyways. Third, after baking, the cookies are going to be really squishy. You're going to think they're not done. Take them out anyways, and carefully move them from the hot baking sheet to a cool, flat surface (like plates, not racks!!). The cookies will cool and be nice and soft, but will harden a bit too, so you can actually eat them. I also added white chocolate chunks, which was yummy.",

And of course....add a couple handfulls of chocolate chips! This recipes was really delightful!",
