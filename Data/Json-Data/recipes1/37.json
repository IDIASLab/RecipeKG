I used 2 chopped apples added 1 tsp vanilla 2 pinches of ground nutmeg 1 tbsp cinnamon and sprinkled in extra flour wheat germ and oatmeal to compensate for the extra apple. I omitted the walnuts (I didn't have any on hand) and the raisins (my kids aren't really raisin fans)and I only used 1 cup of brown sugar. I then baked 3 cookies as test cookies to see how they would turn out. They turned out really soft and moist but still lacking in flavor. So I sprinkled in some more cinnamon and 2 pinches of nutmeg. They were better. I think next time though and there will be a next time I will use applesauce instead of milk and see how that goes. Oh and I also baked them in a preheated oven at 350F for 12 minutes I've never baked cookies at 400F before.",

I think I would double the apple next time because I really couldn't taste any. The batter is very dry until the apples are added then it becomes more like a drop batter.
