The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it seems there was something missing from the basic recipe. Overall it's great though. And those who don't have the fresh seasonings on hand you don't use the same amount as you would fresh. You use 1/3 of the amount dried you use for fresh. So you would need 1/6 cup of basil which is 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons of basil and 2 teaspoons of dried oregano. I hope this help everyone who doesn't have access to the fresh herbs.",
