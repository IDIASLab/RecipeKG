Perhaps the stronger flavor of the tuna covered it up so I'd suggest plain garlic powder. But all in all they were pretty decent though I thought only enough mixture for 4 (whole) muffins.

I had about 8-10 ounces of meat from crab legs, so I used that.  Only used about a tablespoon of butter (3/8 cup seemed like WAY too much!), 2 tablespoons of \"Mayo w/ Olive Oil\", 1/4 tsp. garlic powder (NOT garlic salt), and 1/4 tsp. seasoned salt.  This was just enough for a mixture that was mostly crab, which is what I wanted.  I used multigrain sandwich rounds instead of muffins, sprinkled the top with just a pinch of plain bread crumbs, and broiled as indicated (about 7 minutes).  They were fantastic!  Definite make again.  Next time I'm going to use some sliced French bread sticks for the toast.",
