Topped with a dollop of sour cream. Sort of a white chili but different. Liked the addition of hominey (yellow instead of white). Added a bit more chicken chicken broth cumin and salt and a can of green chile enchilada sauce. When I added the enchilada sauce it went from good/O.K. to great. Also a friend took the leftovers and mixed in a can of tomatoes with green chiles and added cilantro cooked it down and served with rice. Very good and easy soup. Used frozen chopped onion as a timesaver.",
