I made this as a dessert for my fiance on Valentine's Day, and both he and I LOVED it! The vanilla pudding had a subtle sweetness but didn't overpower with its flavor. You have to let the pudding sit for five minutes before pouring it into the pie crust -- that way the crust won't get soggy. I used a graham cracker crust, brushed it with egg whites and baked for 5 minutes at 350 degrees -- made the crust shiny and stronger. I found that four hours was the perfect time to let the pudding chill in the crust in the fridge. SO GOOD! Thank you!",

We used the same fruits as in the recipe (except no raspberries), with a graham cracker crust and pre-made pudding cups, and apricot jam for the glaze.  Buying pre-made crust and pudding saved lots of time, and cutting the fruit really didn't take long at all.  This is the PERFECT summertime or cookout dessert - so light tasting, and sweet enough without being overpowering.  TRY THIS RECIPE!\r\nUpdated to add:  Be sure to only make what you'll eat right away, though, because it does NOT last in the fridge;  the glaze puddles on top of the pudding, which is not very attractive.",
