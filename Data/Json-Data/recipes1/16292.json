I used bulk sausage browned and crumbled instead of bacon, no nutmeg, canned diced tomatoes and a few squirts of tomato paste, basil and italian herbs.  I served with fresh grated parmesan, a squeeze of lemon and some garlic croutons.  Took me back to my grandmother's table on Sunday afternoon, she was from Naples, had 10 kids and over 40 grandkids and served a lot of beans and greens out of economic necessity.  To me it is a gourmet treat.",

I've made countless soups similar to this but the flavor of this was different, one that neither Hubs nor I were particularly fond of. Since it was the only ingredient I've never used  before in soups, and since I didn't use the optional nutmeg or red pepper flakes, my guess is that it was the fresh sage that we didn't care for, that we thought gave this an odd flavor. Omit it (and maybe even the basil too) and this would be a far better soup.",

Am I glad I did1  I did alter/add a few ingredients but I'm sure it would be fine stand alone.  Increased the bacon to four slices and fried it by itself and then drained almost all the fat.  Added a bit of EVO and sauteed the onion and extra garlic......can't have too much garlic.  Increased the sun dried tomatoes to about 1/3 C.  The Parmesan rind has to be the key to this recipe.  I've seen it on TV but never tried it myself.  It gave the soup a wonderful flavor.  I think six cups broth is a little shy for soup, if you want it soupy maybe eight cups is better.  I used four cups broth but the orzo I used was already cooked and leftover  so you need to take that into account.   I also increased the basil to about a 1/4C......we like fresh basil!  We loved it and will make it again.",
