I have made these several times, ever since the video for them was featured well over a year ago. I never knew there was a printed recipe for them!  As this recipe's first reviewer I highly recommend them, particularly if you love artichokes as much as I do.  (When I was a little girl Santa used to put a jar of marinated artichokes in my Christmas stocking!) The directions are helpful (especially the draining part) and the ingredients spot on. Canned artichokes make these super easy and they can easily be assembled in advance to pop in the oven just before serving. Ever since I discovered these, my array of appetizers would not be complete without them.",
