I made 2 changes -- 1) I had no buttermilk so I soured my own milk with 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice and then however much milk makes 1/2 cup of the milk/lemon juice solution. 2) I wanted to make the topping a bit richer so I added chocolate chips and almond slivers to the cinnamon and brown sugar mixture. I put half of the batter in the pan sprinkled just cinnamon and brown sugar over the top then put the rest of the batter in the pan and covered the rest of the batter with the cinnamon/brown sugar/almond/chocolate chip mixture. It turned out wonderfully! My husband was so happy when he saw it coming out of the oven!",

It was a little confusing to my 8 year old though because step one has you pour the batter into a pan and then step three has you prepare the pan (\"how do you prepare the pan once the batter is in it mom?\") I didn't follow the rest exactly as written either: I subbed in half fresh-ground whole wheat pastry flour to make it a little healthier used pecans instead of walnuts because we don't like walnuts much and used soured goat's milk instead of buttermilk because that's what we had. The texture is moist and light the flavor cinnamon-y and the topping crunchy and sweet. We'll make it again!",
