You need to adjust for the thickness of your fillets (boil/broil times) but this is dang close!! The sugar in the boiling mixture adds the sweetness and the texture of the cod is tender and delicious! I broiled the fish with less butter and ate it with no extra butter and it was still DELICIOUS!! How good would it be with extra buttah??? Will make again and again and again!!",
