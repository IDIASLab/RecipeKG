I then use 1/3 of the sauce for dinner, and divide the remaining sauce into 2 freezer bags and freeze them.  Then the next two times I make this meal, all I have to do is thaw and warm the sauce in the microwave while I cook the fish.",

A wonderful blend of ingredients that came together to make a delicious drizzling sauce - dark, rich and a little sweet.  A little is nice, more would ruin the dish.  I liked the cilantro to finish but Hubs could have done without.  I baked the fish at 400 degrees until the fish was cooked through; for my thick halibut filets that took about 15 minutes.  I served this with \"Sesame Udon Noodles,\" recipe also from this site and they complemented each other well.",

Served with Jasmine rice and asparagus with shitake mushrooms.  Here's the kicker - I  couldn't find 'mirin' - so I substituted reisling (1.5 cups).  It was great!  The sauce is salty (sauce for 18 eaten by 2 people, go figure) so next time I might try low soldium soy.  Thanks!  Husband really liked it!",

The sauce on this is so easy to throw together, delicious, and light tasting.  It's also very versatile.
