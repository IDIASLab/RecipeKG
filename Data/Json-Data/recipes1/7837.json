I halved the recipe as I was only cooking for three. Also a food processor is a must. It only took me 10 minutes to prepare this. I did everything in the processor shredding cheese and potatoes and chopping the onion. Also I only cooked for 60 minutes and the casserole was crisp and done. I had to cover with foil the last 15 minutes and it still burned a little on the sides. I will start with the foil if I make it again. This may be due to the larger pan I used (9x11.5). If you add more cheese I think these would taste just like the potatoes at Cracker Barrel. I also added about a teaspoon of dried mustard for extra flavor. I probably won't make again for home but may take to a pot luck as I really liked them.",

I grated the potatoes and cheese in my food processor which saved some time although certainly handgrating would not be a problem. Instead of cooking in a loaf pan I did as others suggested and used a 9 x 13 inch pan. I found they browned just fine without having to raise the temperature to do so. I also found they were done in about 45 minutes instead of 1 hour. I forgot to squeeze the water out of the potatoes but found that was not a problem. The potatoes were perfect. I think next time I might try making them with a bit of a kick by adding some hot sauce jalapeno peppers or chili powder. This was an easy recipe to make and except for cooking time it didn't take that long to fix.",
