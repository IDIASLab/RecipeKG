Our favorite variation is Surprise Muffins.  Put 1 tablespoon of batter into muffin tin, top with 1 teaspoon of jelly (strawberry or plum) then add batter to fill muffin tin 2/3 full.  Bake as usual.  The \"surprise\" is the jelly center!  I love basic recipes that can be used again and again - and this is one of them!!",
