As usual I had to change some ingredients - Italian bread crumbs fresh ground ginger instead of powder corn starch instead of flour and I used ground sirloin. As for preparation I drained the meatballs after cooking them and while they sat I mixed up the liquids in a separate bowl then added them to the hot skillet to remove the tasty \"brown bits\" from the pan. I had no problems with the thickener. I just substitued equal parts corn starch for flour (I don't like using flour). I did heat up the liquid to boiling after removing the meat - perhaps that was the issue for many reviewers. I knew a \"simmered\" sauce wouldn't thicken - this did right away. It's a perfect mix of sweet spicy and sour! I served this over spatzle noodles with frozen sauerkraut on the side - YUMMY!",

I made a couple of minor changes I think improved the recipe adding an egg to the meat/milk mixture. also added a teaspoon of beef base to the liquid mix before thickening the gravy. increased flour to 1/8 cup mixing in 1/2 cup cold water making a thinner flour mixture to mix with the hot liquid. added chopped fresh parsley for color before serving. the egg gave the meatballs a very tender texture and the beef base enriched the flavor of the gravy. served it all with mashed red potatoes sweet and sour red cabbage steamed green beans and applesauce. thanks so much for an easy german food recipe!",

My mom was born in Germany taught me how to make it and our version doesn't use allspice ginger or cloves. Instead I seasoned the meat with garlic and onion powders salt and pepper and caraway seeds and minced onion. I did brown the meatballs as the recipe stated to get those flavorful caramelized bits on the bottom of the pan. Once browned I added more minced onion to the pan and then sprinkled in flour to make a roux. One cup of liquid was definitely not enough to make gravy so I used an entire box of beef stock. I didn't measure but slowly added in the sugar and vinegar until I was happy with the balance of slightly sweet and sour. The gravy was again seasoned and made richer with some Gravy Master and a dollop of sour cream to smooth it all out. The end result was very good and I thank you for a great start!",
