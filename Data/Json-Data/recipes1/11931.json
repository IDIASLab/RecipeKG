I went ahead and made it exactly according to the recipe instructions and boy was it good!!  Dee-lish!  There were a few noodles that turned out to be a little crunchy when it was done, but this did not detract from the casserole.  The few noodles still crunchy after baking had been located on top of the casserole, where they didn't get as much moisture from the liquid ingredients as the rest did.  Stirring one time halfway through cooking will solve that; that is the only change I will make to the recipe when I make it next time.  The flavor was really delicious and it's very easy to prepare.

My 2-1/2-year-old helped me assemble this and actually ate it which is saying something for my picky little girl. My husband who has a hard time trying \"new\" things was very surprised and actually ate seconds. He said it was \"very good.\" I did substitute one can of cream of chicken soup for cream of mushroom soup. I also added some salt and pepper to the mixture before baking. I baked mine for 65 minutes with stirring once after 25 minutes. I covered it with aluminum foil for the first 45 minutes then topped it with a layer of french fried onions. It was delicious. The noodles were perfect. The casserole was not runny! I will make this again and again. Thank you Sandy!",

I was really confused at first about whether or not the pasta needed to be cooked first so I ended up cooking it for 5 minutes in the pot. It didn't do any damage and the casserole turned out great! Also I think its better to keep the foil over it at all times unless you want some cheese on the top. I bet it will taste even better with a little bit of oregano or green onions. I retried this recipe without cooking the pasta and it didn't turn out as great. So people please make sure to cook your pasta for at least 5 minutes before mixing it in.",

Unlike previous reviews our macaroni was cooked all the way through so there were no problems with that. We left out the onions and used all white meat chicken breast in the can and it tasted great!

I think making this decision helped keep some of the excess starch and gummy-ness out of the casserole and I didn't have to worry about undercooked pasta. I used two large cubed chicken breasts that I sauteed with a little butter/EVOO before adding the chopped onion FRESH mushrooms (I don't keep canned mushrooms on hand) and some fresh minced garlic in with it. This really only needed about 20 minutes in the hot oven to heat through seeing as I pre-cooked the macaroni. We didn't really care for this as is. I think it could use some spices or something to make it a little more pleasing to the palate. It's a good start. I think using fresh chicken fresh mushrooms and adding garlic made it a little better than written.",
