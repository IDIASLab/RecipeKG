I cut down on the eggs and I used diced salami instead of ham - but the mild salsa I added to the top completely overwhelmed the eggs and ham/salami. All I tasted was spicy tomato and cold doughy tortillas. I wanted to taste the eggs!! BUT...I had 2 left over with no salsa on top and the next day I opened the wraps and added a little more cheddar and ADDED fresh cooked asparagus re-wrapped and zapped for 60 seconds. DELISHIOUS. I mean really good. Think of tasting scrambled eggs and a mild salami with cheese and fresh asparagus wrapped in a hot tortilla wrap. No salsa. Now THAT'S a ham and cheesy breakfast tortilla!
