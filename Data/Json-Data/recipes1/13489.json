Without salt it would be nearly tasteless. Also it does need more tomatoes and a little more olive oil than called for. I add the extra oil during cooking so that the flavors have a chance to blend. I also let the mixture simmer longer than called for. I do add different vegetables depending on what I have on hand. I have used different types of pasta and have found that my husband and I both prefer angel hair above all others. I now use all ingredients to taste after having experimented with the recipe quite a bit. In all it is a good starting point...but it does need a bit of work.",
