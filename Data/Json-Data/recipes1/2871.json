Simply combine the water, yeast, and sugar and allow to proof. Then add the salt, then flour and knead until no longer sticky. Place in an oiled bowl and allow to rise according to recipe instructions. I rolled my dough out like others and made 2 baguettes. I really think I'll make 3 baguettes next time because I use mine for sandwiches and they were a little too big. After baking, I cut the top off the whole length of the baguette so that the top looks like an upside down triangle (like they do at Subway). This leaves me with a bottom piece that is concave in the middle. I then put 2 pieces of provolone cheese and then top it with Holiday Chicken Salad (this site). I put the filled bottom piece in the oven by itself for about 7 minutes. Then I put mayo on the top piece, and place it in the oven with the bottom piece, and I let it heat for about another 5 minutes or so. It's GREAT!!! The bread is slightly crusty on the outside, moist and soft on the inside....a far cry from those chewy store-bought baguettes. This one's a keeper for sure. Oh, and they freeze well, too. Thanks so much for sharing this one!",

                "reviewBody": "This is an excellent recipe for French bread/baguettes.  I use my KitchenAid and follow standard  bread making procedures.  TIPS/TRICKS for French bread I've learned over the years:  Do NOT add the salt with the flour.  Combine the flour with the yeast mixture and knead for 5-7 min (in mixer).  Remove dough hook, cover work bowl and let sit 15 minutes.  THEN, sprinkle salt evenly over the dough and knead again until the salt is well incorporated.  Set aside in warm place (85\u00b0F) until doubled in size...  proceed with shaping dough as desired.  For those who prefer a more crunchy crust, use only egg white for brushing the loaf - and throw 1/4 cup of water onto the bottom of the oven (avoid heating element if you have an electric oven) - immediately place the loaf in the oven and bake as directed... the water will create steam and gives the bread a crispier crust.  When I prefer a soft crust, I whisk a whole egg (not just the yolk).   Also, bread is typically ready when an instant read thermometer inserted into the bread registers 190-200\u00b0F. For bread sticks omit brushing the dough with egg.  Delicious!",

I lived almost all my life in France and I tried many baguette recipes, but this one is the closest to the real thing I could find. It is not 100% the same, but that's probably because french bakers use a special oven for the baguettes. It was GREAT! CHANGES: I don't have a bread machine, so I used normal yeast (same amount) mixed with water and sugar and set aside until foamy. Last time, I used 2 cups all purp. flour, and added whole wheat until dough was ready.",

I have noticed in some of the reviews that the crust was not crunchy I guess not putting the yolk mixture on top was the reason for it!!! This bread made a thick crunchy crust and the inside was a great texture. Not airy. Was a very big success at my dinner party. Enjoyed by all. Thanks for the great recipe Judy.",
