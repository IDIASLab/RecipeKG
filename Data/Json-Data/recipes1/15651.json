It had that standard cake-like taste. I thought it would be a bit more moist because of the pudding filling. I added a tiny bit of lemon and vanilla extract in the batter which made the flavoring of the cupcakes very tasty. Yet the reason why I gave them four stars was because of the frosting. The frosting was very very runny. I had to put it in the refrigerator to firm it up some more as well as add some more sugar. If I make these another time I may add some milk to the batter and get rid of the butter in the frosting.",

I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a tablespoon of lemon juice to the cupcake batter and an extra teaspoon of vegetable oil. The cake was amazing! To the frosting I added another 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to thicken it a bit which is necessary if you want the frosting to stay on the cupcakes. I also piped the frosting on instead of spread it. There is extra frosting but I used it as dip for fresh strawberries I had on hand. Delicious cupcakes! Strongly recommend it!",
