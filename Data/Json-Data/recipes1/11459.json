I added additional spice per personal preference. If you like a little kick you can add a couple good shakes of white or black pepper which will leave a pleasant warmth on the tongue. I frosted them with a basic cream cheese frosting gently laced with allspice. The cupcakes did not dome even slightly but came out just about level with the tops of the papers when filled about 3/4 with batter. The crumb is exquisitely fine and tender and they're so moist that they don't even shed a crumb when bitten into or pulled apart. For this reason they freeze perfectly when wrapped airtight. Old-fashioned wholesome deliciousness.",
