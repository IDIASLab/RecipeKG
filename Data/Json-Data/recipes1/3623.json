The changes I made was to add a tsp of vanilla to the topping to make it pasty, and to make 32 smaller buns rather then 16 large buns.  These were still the size of a regular bagel so that was fine by me.  As a tip make the topping first, spoon it onto plastic wrap, roll it into a log and chill while making the dough.  Then slice into small rounds with a hot, wet knife and place them onto the buns before baking.  Saves a lot of time this way...",

Instead of making 16 little dough balls, i made 8. They turned out the same size as the ones that you would get at a mexican bakery would make them.(Mexican portions). I also notice that people say that their bread turned out hard..its because they bake small little dough balls for 20mins.over cooking=hard bread.. You should double the size and still cook them for 20mins. If your bread isnt rising well then crank up the oven to 400 for one min. turn it off, put the dough in the warm oven &let it rise(40mins) while you are making the sugar topping.  I followed the recipe exactly(used 4c.flour and 1c.flour while i was kneading it for 10mins)  and i added 1/3c. brown sugar to make the bread a bit more moist  They turn out amazing and the aroma will sure make your neighbors mouth water!",
