Overall, the texture is too jello-like, but I wasn't expecting much due to the simple ingredients.  I was going to serve this to guests but decided against it.  Fun for kids but nothing more.",

The texture is very much like a mousse it's light and the lemon flavor is bold with just enough sweet-tart flavor. I used sugar free jell-o and fat-free whipped topping with no sacrifice to taste. It took close to 1-1/2 hours for the lemonade mixture to thicken to the point where I could beat in the whipped topping and several hours longer in the fridge to jell so plan accordingly. For those of you on Weight Watchers I calculated the points based on 12 servings and the point value is 2. Very nice end to a spring meal.",

Then I beat in the cool whip (in small amounts at first so it didn't get lumpy) and put it in a 9 x 13 pan in the freezer for about 10 minutes. While it was in the freezer I pureed 3 cups fresh strawberries then poured this in lines over the lemon mixture and swirled with a knife. Returned it to the freezer until firm.
