                "reviewBody": "I've made ribs using this method a couple of times since finding the recipe. I've found that for really tender ribs they need to simmer more than an hour - our best yet were simmered for 2.5 hours at a very low simmer and then covered and put in the fridge to cool in the cooking water until we were ready to grill. Also rather than salting the water I used Adolf's meat tenderizer. While the sauce which accompanies the recipe is good I've found that we actually prefer our favorite bottled BBQ sauce. It's just as good and much easier. I grill the ribs until heated thorough and then brush on the sauce during the last few minutes to prevent the sauce from burning. These are great for making ahead and require so little effort that they are definately a keeper.",

The sauce was just a tad lumpy from the onions but completely delicious. My BBQ taste is sweet over tangy. I added about 4 tablespoons of brown sugar just before bringing the sauce to a boil. After the ribs marinated all day I wrapped them lightly in foil and placed them on the grill until they were hot. I then removed the foil and placed the ribs directly on the grill (don't forget the Pam especially if adding the sugar to the sauce. Very easy to lose this meat off of the bone!) to 'grill' each side. My VERY picky 11 year old son LOVED the ribs and my husband said \"I don't think ANYTHING could make these ribs any better!\" My favorite thing about the recipe itself besides the results is the fact that the ingredients are so basic. They are ingredients that most people already have in the kitchen!",
