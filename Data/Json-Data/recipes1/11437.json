Of course I add bay leaves, onion, garlic cloves, rosemary, etc. for added flavor. Or simmer in a stock pot all day and proceed to what I do next: I pour cooked stock (over a fine mesh strainer) into a large bowl or pot, refrigerate until fat solidifies on top & remove it. (After the ham bone cools, I remove all useable meat.) Discard all the leftover stock goop. I simmer rinsed/cleaned split peas in the defatted ham stock (8 - 10 cups) for an hour with 1/2 C diced celery & onion. Then, I add 2 cups diced potatoes, a bay leaf, another clove of crushed garlic & a dash of liquid smoke. After another hour; I add 1 C. diced carrots  & reserved ham (& more diced ham from leftovers) and simmer on low until peas all broken down & carrots are soft. I then I add 1 sm can of Evap milk for body and simmer for a few more minutes. Of course you can add or detract whatever spices/herbs and I added a tsp of McCormicks Carribean Jerk Seasoning to give more spice/earthiness to my soup. Great recipe you can alter to your own tastes! A splash of lemon or lime juice added before serving gives the soup a note of acidity as well. I know, I changed this up some but, I can't help myself, LOL.",

I saut\u00e9ed the onion and carrots together in a little bit of olive oil and added them to the broth once I removed the fat from cooling it all night and heated it up. I threw in the peas and the ham and because I had used left over honey-baked ham I added a dash of Worcestershire sauce a teaspoon of thyme a dash of Cholula hot sauce and 3 bay leaves to cut the sweetness a little. I heated it up a little bit but had to stop due to unexpected company. Today I started it back and put it on low on the stove and left for about an hour and a half. Well luck was with me because I accidentally have hit the button on the stove and it was on High the whole time I was gone! I thought for sure the peas would be stuck to the bottom of the pot but all that happened was the peas broke down and the soup was done! I did run the immersion blender around a little just to make sure most of it was liquidated. I can t believe how lucky I was and also because this soup is GREAT. Thanks for a great recipe!",
