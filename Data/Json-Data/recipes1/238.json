I make them about once a week!   for perfect lemon squares: 1. mix the flour and cold butter with your hands. once that is done add the p.sugar. I use a 9x9 pan. 2. only bake the crust for 15 minutes. 3. when making the filling I always add lemon zest. I use most of the lemon. I let my nose tell me it's enough. then I add all the juice form the lemon. 4. after I poor the filling into to hot crust i bake it for 20 more minutes.  they come out PERFECT every time. even my friends that don't like sweets love these. they are so fast to make and i always have everything on hand.",
