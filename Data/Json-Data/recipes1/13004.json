They turned out absolutely PERFECT though and I would highly recommend as these are so much easier to use than store-bought manicotti shells which always tear on me during the boiling process and are a pain in the butt to stuff.  Not only that, these are tasty, foolproof, and uses ingredients one always has on hand.  I used my smallest (6\") non-stick frying pan, wiped with an oiled paper towel between 1/4 cupfuls of batter, tipping the pan immediately after pouring to get the batter evenly over the bottom of the pan and form perfect circles.  After about 15 seconds I turned them over for another 10-15 seconds, took them out and put on waxed paper until ready to use. I used the filling and sauces from the \"Manicotti Alla Romana\" from this site (which I refer to as Cannelloni when using these batter shells), excellent!  These are also awesome using a tiny bit of extra water and 1/8 cupful batter for crepes, this is a great recipe.",

Used a generous pinch of Kosher Salt, added granulated garlic and whisked. Used 8\" pan that I sprayed with Canola Oil Spray and wiped with a paper towel. Made large \"shells\" (1/3 cup at a time) and then stuffed them with Cottage Cheese (low fat Knudson), parmesan and fresh white Italian cheese mix (bagged) chopped fresh basil, granulated garlic, onion powder, parsley, oregano, salt and pepper. Beat the Cottage Cheese mixture with a whisk so it would resemble Ricota (hiding ingred. from hubby). Mixed roasted veggies in with the cheese. Wrapped each Shell like a burrito and placed in a layer of sauce. 9 X 13 glass pan - sprayed with cooking spray. Covered all with sauce and cheese. So So Good! Posted two pix of my efforts. Hubby ate 1/2 the pan. DEFINITE KEEPER!",
