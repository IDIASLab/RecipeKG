The taste of the punch was good and very easy to throw together although the hand did not work out for me so I'm only rating this 4 stars. I followed the directions as written and ended up with enough raspberry mixture to fill 2 gloves. I froze them for 2 full days and while I was removing the glove a finger on each hand broke off. The kids thought it was still cool to have the chopped off finger floating in the punch bowl with the hand missing a finger. Very Halloween! I think next time I will just freeze water and make an ice hand. I hope they edit the recipe to indicate \"latex free\" glove. I used vinyl because you just never know who could have an allergy.",

It was still really cool though because it still looked neat. Kept the punch cool AND it did not lose its form because the jello held it together. Thank you for sharing this idea. Notes for others to consider: pay attention to how long the gloves are if you want there to be an arm this recipe made two gloves for me both did not have long arms. Try to separate the fingers when freezing as it is this that makes the fingers come off when taking off the glove",

A few seconds in warm water helped it all slip off better instead of cutting. I'll wear my own gloves next time too because that sucker was cold to handle! The punch is ubber-simple and very good. The hand did a great job of keeping it all cold without any additional ice and yet still kept its form because of the gelatin. Just be sure to refrigerate the cider and ginger-ale the day before to give it a head start! I actually was not able to find any sparkling apple cider so I just used a gallon of plain old apple cider with one 2 liter bottle of ginger-ale. There was still plenty of carbonation from the ginger-ale--especially since it went in cold so there was very little release on pouring.",
