I also substantially reduced the cooking time originally called for in the recipe. I did 19 minutes on each side and then 10 minutes at the end with the cheese mixture and even then the chicken was a little on the dry side. Next time I will probably reduce the cooking time by a minute or two each way. Still the flavors were so good and my husband can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.",

It tastes good it's easy enough. Easily a household staple. I ended up adding minced garlic to the celery soup in step one (and omitted the garlic powder later). Because I cut the chicken breasts the long-way I reduced the cooking time by ten minutes in each cooking segment. Next time I may add broccoli cuts and switch the mushroom soup to cream of chicken. Serve over rice (-brown rice works just fine).",
