A few notes: make sure the nuts are very finely chopped; I also needed far more than just a half a cup to roll the cookies in. Adding the cocoa makes a delicious cookie but it's misleading to call it 'brownie like'. If you're not fond of nuts or don't have them on hand the cocoa version is good even without them especially if you mix a small amount of cinnamon into the sugar that you roll them in. Lastly I usually refrigerate sugar cookie doughs before I shape them to make them easier to handle but don't do that with this recipe; the dough is soft but manageable and it holds the nuts better at room temperature.",
