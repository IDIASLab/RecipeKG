The flavor of the mustard and mayonnaise are really lost when they are rolled in the stuffing. I used stovetop stuffing in the chicken flavor and I think that is really dominant. It has small and large pieces and makes the crust very crunchy and it's also salty so that makes up for the seeming lack of flavor. I would make again but I would almost describe it as a crunchy baked chicken. I have to add that some people don't think this has enough flavor but they are using italian bread crumbs. The stuffing mix is very flavorful and that really makes the dish.",
