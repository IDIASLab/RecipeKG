I followed this recipe as closely as I possibly could. After browning the beef mixture I tossed it into a pressure cooker for about 45 minutes with my carrots and the bouillon water. After that I took some of the \"stock\" from the pressure cooker and mixed in the flour then I poured everything into a normal saucepan (on the stove) added the potatoes celery I put in a little garlic and a sprinkle of cayenne for some heat. It was delicious! Thanks for sharing your recipe.",

You could make this with beef or lamb as well. I used an electric kitchen kettle because my crock pot was not big enough for the amount of meat I had. Oh and a trick I'd learned from my dad was to soak the venison overnight in vinegar and water and rinse well the next day to make sure there's no gamey taste. I did that with this recipe so I'm not sure if it was that or the recipe but there was no gamey taste at all. Served it over rice. Husband thought this was a great dinner so will definitely make again. I only gave 4 stars because of the lack of seasoning. Served it over rice and husband LOVED it!",
