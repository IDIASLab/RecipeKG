The cheesecake layer is a little light so I usually call it strawberry cheese pie instead of cheesecake. I usually use strawberry or cherry pie filling on top instead of fresh fruit. I think the tartness of the cherries is a nice contrast to the mild sweetness of the cheesecake layer. I think it wouldn't be sweet enough with just plain fruit so if I were going to use fresh fruit I think I would puree it with a little sugar.",

Used 8oz real cream cheese and whipped it all up with a spatula. Poured into a pre-baked pie shell and let sit for about 4 hours. If I figured it out correctly there is no more than 7 carbs per slice (6 slices per pie). A perfect light dessert that satisfies the sweet tooth but doesn't blow the carbs out of control. Think I will add a package of SF instant pudding mix to the filling to change the flavors around. Will see what happens but if it turns out good have found my new go to dessert recipe for the diabetics in my family.",

After one bite he said \"This is the very best dessert you've ever made!\" It s so light and fresh tasting with nice summer fruit in the markets right now. Here s what I did: Used 8 ounces of lite whipped topping rather than 12 oz. Added 1/3 C. of instant vanilla pudding to a brick of cream cheese along with 2 T. of white sugar 2 tsp. lemon juice and a bit of vanilla. (The pudding was a worthwhile experiment!) Next time I ll add more lemon juice. I used fresh blueberries for the topping. My graham cracker crust was leftover from another recipe and it only covered the bottom of the pie plate which was fine. Didn't take long at all for the filling to \"set up\" before I topped it with fruit. Also note that it was very easy to slice it stayed firm while slicing. What a fantastic summer recipe! Thanks Anne-Marie!",
