My guests as well as myself thought that it was very flavorful with a wonderful creaminess. I didn't find it to be overly spicy as written so I added a bit more ground red pepper and a dash of liquid smoke in addition to the smoked paprika. I did not add the turkey bacon into the mac and cheese itself. Instead I let the bacon cool completely then put it in my food processor on \"grind\" until it had the consistancy of bread crumbs then sprinkled it on top. When making mac and cheese I usually use a mix of cheddar and American cheese but I thought that the Velveeta melted wonderfully and made this mac and cheese extremely smooth and creamy. I will definitely be making this again perhaps for the Superbowl!",
