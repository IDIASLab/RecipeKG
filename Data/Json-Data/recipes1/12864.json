So I added about 8 ounces (dry) of cooked teeny-tiny whole wheat (gotta get those whole grains in) pasta shells and some already diced ham they sell at the supermarket. I used half mayo and half Miracle Whip because I wanted the slight sweetness and tang Miracle Whip provides. I also added a few diced onions. In addition I grated the cheese instead of dicing it (because I'm lazy). This was a very good salad Joa. It kept me fed all week. Thanks so much for the recipe!",
