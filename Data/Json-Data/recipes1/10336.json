I did \"tweak\" this a bit to get more of a cornbread flavor. I used 2 & 1/2 cups of buttermilk baking mix and 3/4 cup of cornmeal. I do like a sweet cornbread, but I did cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup and it was plenty sweet. I used 1 cup of buttermilk vs. milk and it baked up nice and golden brown in more like 35 minutes. This was oh so buttery and moist served nice and warm. The leftovers are great for breakfast served with jam!",

You can also try it this way, it's less crumbly and still good: 3 cups Bisquick, 2 cups milk, 1 1/4 cup sugar, 3 eggs, 2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp vanilla.  It's a Filipino receipe for Bibinka NOT cornbread but tastes the same as this recipe with a lot less crumbs.  You can add drops of creamcheese on top and sprinkle with sugar before cooking.  Yummy.  I'm eating it right now.",

I decreased the sugar to 3/4 c substituted Egg Beaters for one of the 3 eggs and used 1/4 c. melted butter & 1/2 c. Lite sourcream. They were very moist! To make 18 muffins fill \"Pam\" sprayed cups with 1/4 c. of batter and bake for 18-20 min. These were fantastic fresh out of the oven and I'm anxious to see if they're even better tomorrow with my soup.",
