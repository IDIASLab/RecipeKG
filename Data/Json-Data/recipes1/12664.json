They definitely taste better warmed though I didn't try them with the suggested coffee or espresso. The slightly bad news (which a previous reviewer ran into) is that they are kind of difficult for inexperienced bakers to make. I consider myself a low-intermediate baker by now but I've never made anything like this. I was pretty sure I measured 6 cups of flour and not 5 and the dough was quite wet and sticky. I slightly panicked and tossed in another cup or so and tried to continue. The dough was still fairly sticky such that I didn't think it possible or worthwhile to do the \"scoring the perimeter\" step so I skipped that. I baked the first half-dozen for 20 minutes; then I added another half-cup of flour or so to the remaining dough and baked the second half-dozen for 22 minutes. The second batch turned out better being slightly browned on top. Lastly I guess I was expecting these to look somewhat like bagels if not pretzels but the outside texture was slightly bumpy and irregular. As I said these did taste pretty good but the recipe threw me some curves along the way. I just hope the results I got were close enough to what I was supposed to get.",
