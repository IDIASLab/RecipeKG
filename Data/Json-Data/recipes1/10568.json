I realized after I had begun to prepare it that I only had 1/4 c. oil so I used that and added 2-3 T butter melted and 1/2 c water. I wanted to use up the sour cream I had so it was probably between 1-1 1/4 c sour cream. I only used 2 T poppy seeds for our personal tastes and lastly I added 1 tsp each of vanilla almond and lemon extracts to the batter - my favorite combination. I sprayed my bundt pan thoroughly with cooking spray and sugared it per the instructions and the cake released from the pan beautifully. It was done for me at 50 min. I glazed it with about 1 1/2 c powdered sugar 2 T butter melted a tsp each of vanilla almond and lemon extracts (again) and a little water to get the consistency I wanted. All these little accidents added up to a fabulous cake so I will probably do it exactly the same way again! But I do not think you could do anything to keep this cake from being scrumptious. My daughter declared it \"deeeee-licious\". Thanks for a great recipe. Good way to use up that cake mix I had on hand.",
