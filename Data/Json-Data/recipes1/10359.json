To get them dry quicker, bake on an ungreased cookie sheet at 150 degrees for one hour. Remove from the cookie sheets and bake on the oven racks for another hour and a half. (Don't roll thinner than 1/4 inch if you're using this method.)",

It was fairly easy to work with and kid friendly (I have a two year old and a one year old.) We put the dough between two pieces of wax paper to roll it out. We used a straw to make a hole for the ribbon and we also baked them in the oven as was suggested by the other reviews. I did have a problem getting them off of the cookie sheet- because they weren't completely dry so be patient eventually they do dry! We made about 60 ornaments and the only suggestion I can think us is to make sure you don't roll the dough too thin. At least a forth of an inch or so. We bought our cinnamon at Walmart- it was only.50 a bottle and we used 5 bottles.",

One variation that we tried this year was to melt hard candy in the center of the cookie cut outs. We just cut out the middle of ceratin cookie forms (simple shapes work best) put some crushed hard candies in the center and melted them in the oven. Make sure you spray the cookie sheet so they dont stick. They look like stained glass!! Lots of fun and they look and smell great!!",

Definately use something larger than a toothpick for the hole - (we ended up needing to drill a larger hole through all of ours) - a straw would probably work better. Got the cinnamon at Sam's Club for a little over 3 (exactly 3 c.). Took about 3 days to dry if not baked. I would cut them at LEAST 1/4\" - probably a bit thicker. We used fabric paint to decorate and craft paint. They turned out really cute! My 5 yr old and 3 yr old had a blast. Also after paint dried I used spray polyurithane on both sides to preserve. I was worried it would interfere with the smell but it didn't. All the relatives loved receiving these from the kids this year!",
