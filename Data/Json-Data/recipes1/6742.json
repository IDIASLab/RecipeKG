I think this is more low carb than having regular pizza as well.  I may try using a pita in the future but I've been making this recipe using whole wheat tortillas.  Instead of grilling them, I put them on aluminum foil on a cookie sheet.  Then I spread a little olive oil on top, then red sauce, shredded lowfat mozzarella, & then whatever I want as a topping.  I bake them at 350 degrees for about 15 to 20 minutes.  Even though they're thin, you actually can pick them up to eat them like pizza slices.  I've topped them at various times with fresh sliced mushrooms  (which I've microwaved for a couple minutes 1st & drained so they wouldn't be too watery on the pizza), zucchini slices (partially microwaved 1st), & cooked drained ground meat.  YUM!",
