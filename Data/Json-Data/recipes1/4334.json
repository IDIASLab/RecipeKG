It is sugggested to use a sweet champagne such as Moscoto or I use Asti when I can't find it.    The recipe is a light cake with almost an angel food cake texture.  I use simple syrup to keep it moist and add some red food coloring to make it \"pink champagne cake\".  You can also add melted chocolate to 1/3 of the batter and swirl it through the cake.   Any fruit filling or curds go really well with it.  You can make a Mimosa cake by filling it with orange curd and frosting it with a champagne buttercream or vanilla Italian Meringue buttercream.  When making scratch cakes make sure you whip your butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  On low mix your dry and wet ingredients.  Do not over mix.  Gently fold your egg whites in by dividing the whites into thirds.  You'll have a perfect cake!",

I used a little bit extra champagne (total of about a cup for the full recipe) because the batter seemed like it would be way too dry and thick without it and I baked it in mini muffin tins for adorably bite-sized cupcakes to take to a buffet. They turned out to be a huge hit--not too sweet slightly dense not the least bit dry or crumbly and with a subtle champagne flavor that I foiled with lime buttercream frosting (the Luscious Buttercream Frosting on this site). This recipe is definitely a keeper and I'll absolutely be making it again!",

The batter is very thick prior to folding in the stiff egg whites. It's best to lighten with the 1/3 whites as instructed but then fold the batter into the remaining whites. Make a very firm but delicious cake great for decorating or just simply sift some powdered sugar on top. I highly recommend the coconut filling!",

Bowl and beater must be clean and free of water to make the stiff peaks. Also increase the champagne to 1 cup and add 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I topped with whipped cream and fresh berries. Everyone loved it!!",

I even got compliments to the extent of \"We should totally st6art serving this at the restaurant!\" I thought it would be a disaster but it was absolutely delicious! You could definately taste the champagne. I was weary of the comment below saying that it would taste like bread so to add vanilla. I only added a few sprinles of vanilla sugar and it came out just amazingly! I highly reccomend this cake to all. This was the 1st cake I ever made and it was a HIT!",
