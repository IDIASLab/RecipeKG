We didn't use the red food coloring or fruit preserver (and the fruit didn't discolor at all; we just made sure to immediately coat it with the glaze so the apple/banana weren't left exposed to air) and we only mixed in about 3/4 of the finished glaze and it held it together just fine. We used sugar in our graham cracker crust recipe and wouldn't have changed a thing although some people might prefer things a little less sweet. A definite hit and a recipe my Grandma plans to bring out again for company when she wants something a little different.",
