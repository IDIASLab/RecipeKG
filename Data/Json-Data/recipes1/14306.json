(See, we DO eat more than pasta and pizza, although this IS good with pasta, or roasted potatoes too!) Use olive oil and, if you can, fresh rosemary. And be sure not to overcook your chops or they'll be tough and dry. Growing up we always prepared chicken this way too--particularly good with a cut up fryer rather than boneless chicken breasts as you want to cook this long enough to infuse all these wonderful flavors into the meat. Simple yet delicious.",

This allows a nice amount of sauce.  For those who experience \"tough\" chops, the key to this recipe is thickness.  The thicker the chop (get as close to 1-inch as you can) the better.  Breakfast-cut or traditional pork chops will not work.  They are too thin and will dry during the browning stage.  Use the thicker center cuts and they will turn out great!  Like other reviewers, I slice fresh yellow onion and mushroom and add them in the last few minutes of simmering.  If you're looking for a new spin on comfort foods, this is the recipe for you to try!  Goes perfectly with mashed potatoes and green beans sauteed in soy sauce and minced garlic.",

I used olive oil instead of butter to brown the chops, since I didn't have any wine on hand I used apple  juice (the light apple flavor was great with the pork), and I just cooked and turned them until they were done.
