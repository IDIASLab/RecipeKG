                "reviewBody": "5.6.21 There are a couple things that I think are strange in the ingredients listing.  I mean, 1-1/3 can cans of black beans, really?  What to do with the other 2/3?  Shouldn\u2019t this recipe be either 1 or 2 cans?  I scaled this recipe to 4 servings, and I used a whole can of black beans.  Also, wasn\u2019t quite sure what the recipe submitter was looking for with crushed tomatoes.  Typically, when I see that, I\u2019m using a can of crushed tomatoes, but I certainly wouldn\u2019t open a can just for the small amount indicated in the recipe .  I cut up a fresh tomato, put it into my mini chopper, gave it a whirl, and was on my way to tomato juice.  I cut up another one, processed less, and then just drained the juice.  I set the timer for 20 minutes, checked for doneness, and it was good to go. Don\u2019t leave out the red wine vinegar, that\u2019s really important to the taste.  Garnished with some chopped cilantro and served with a wedge of lime.  Just a few little quirks IMO, but on the positive side, this really does taste quite good.  And it was nice having the rice actually cook WITH the beans. ..one pot to clean. Thanks for sharing your recipe.",
