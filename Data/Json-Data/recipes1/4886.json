I precooked the chicken in a skillet with a little olive oil salt pepper and a pinch of cayenne. I doubled the sauce added the green pepper onion and added pineapple tidbits and cooked them all together for approximately 15 minutes to soften the veggies and then added the chicken and about 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes. It turned out wonderfully sweet but with a kick from the pepper flakes. I served it with fried rice (brown rice with fresh peas green onion and carrot) and a nice green salad.

First I seasoned boneless skinless thighs with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder and I put them on the gas grill.  In the meantime I made the sauce as stated in the recipe. (added crushed red pepper to taste; used fresh ginger and garlic) I chopped the green pepper, onion and water chestnuts and sauteed all three in olive oil. I mixed the veggies and sauce together and spooned over the grilled chicken.  Served with white rice... Quick easy weeknight dinner in a 1/2 an hour.",

I just used that juice (plus 1 cup of water) and cut up the pineapples into it and left out the pepper. Because of my kids I cut the onion really small and cooked it and some garlic (instead of garlic salt) with the chicken. I also doubled the sauce. The only thing I had to go with it was bowtie pasta but it was super. Couldn't get enough of it. I will be making this again a lot. It was super easy to do and the pineapple chunks made a big difference. The water chestnuts gave it a great crunch. Once again it was great (and great leftover - I just had some for lunch)",
