Be sure to slice your potatoes thin so that they cook all the way through in the alloted amount of time called for, or else your pork chops will be overdone and your potatoes won't be completely cooked.  I seasoned my chops with seasoned salt in lieu of table salt to add more flavor (I didn't pre measure the salt, pepper or garlic powder either - just seasoned to taste).  I also added some minced garlic from a jar to the soup mixture and shredded cheddar cheese to cover the casserole.  This is similar to the pork chop and potato casserole recipe by Wendy on this site (hence the idea for adding cheese).  The pork chops go well with green beans or a tossed salad and dinner rolls on the side.  A cold glass of milk completes the meal!  This one's a definite keeper : ) Thanks!",
