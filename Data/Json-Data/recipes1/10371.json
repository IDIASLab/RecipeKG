I made this exactly per the recipe, only change I made was extra cheese, my family loves italian cheeses, other that I did it exactly. I made this on friday night, and we have eaten 6 meals from this one dish! And it tastes better and better every time. My only recommendation is to use a 3 or maybe even 4 quart dish, for I used a 3 qt and it very nearly overflowed the dish, maybe cause of all the extra cheese I used! I will make this a regular menu item in my home, it was a huge hit!",

Great for a family style meal with several guests or a pot luck.\n\nSome tips: As suggested by other reviews I seasoned the ground beef with italian seasoning and added minced garlic. To give this recipe a real italian flare, I bought spaghetti sauce with italian sausage already inside so I didnt have to buy and cook sausage too. It turned out just right.. not too overpowering. I also added a small amount of the sauce to cover the first layer of ziti as suggested by another review and it came out perfect.. I think it might have been too dry on the bottom otherwise.\n\nA large skillet was too small for all of the spaghetti sauce. I had to transfer it to a large pot. An electric skillet might be big enough.. \n\nThis recipe fills a 9x13 to the brim so make sure you dont use anything smaller. I also baked this uncovered on the center rack with no isses and the cheese came out nice and golden brown. \n\nDefinitely will make this again!!",

I used Italian sausage and browned it with onion and garlic. I drained the fat off and added the remaining jar of spaghetti sauce. I sprayed a deep baking pan with olive oil spray and then added a layer of ziti, sausage mixture, shredded mozzarella cheese, sliced provolone topped off with sliced pepperoni. I repeated the layers, except for the pepperoni, and topped it off with the parmesan and the fresh basil. I also made an extra pan of this for a friend. Everyone raved about how good it was! I was surprised when my pasta hating son had two helpings! I am giving this 5 stars because it is an excellent base recipe. Thank you!",

Sour cream is MUCH less expensive than riccotta cheese, and many guests do not believe that there isnt riccotta in this ziti.  The only things I do different is that I use an 8oz package of each of the cheese and I assemble differently.  While the pasta is cooking, I brown the beef and onion, drain and mix the 2 jars of sauce with the meat...simmer until pasta is all done. After draining the pasta, I mix it with the meat/sauce.  Time to layer...half meat/sauce/pasta, layer all the provolone, spread a container of sour cream, then rest of meat/sauce/pasta, all the mozz cheese, and a sprinkle of parm cheese.  Bake about 30-45 minutes until hot. NEVER dry and just amazing in taste.  My old family ziti recipe has gone out the window!",

I thawed it in the refrigerator overnight and baked as directed.  Just as good as the first time!  I'll be making this a lot for families in our squadron as they have babies or move in/out.

I used a pound of whole wheat penne instead of ziti.  I used 93% lean ground beef, a red onion, and organic pasta, pasta sauce, and sour cream.  I used shredded mozzarella and a 16 oz. container of sour cream.  I made one big deep dish(probably about 11x4 or something) and one foil 8x8 pan to freeze for later.  I loved the fresh basil on top, and added some fresh oregano too, because I just bought an oregano plant yesterday!  My hubby and I loved this, and so did our one-year old!",
