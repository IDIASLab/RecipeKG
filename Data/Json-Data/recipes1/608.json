Prepare these as your brownie package directs, since they all differ slightly. Bake these in foil liners to eliminate the sticking issue. And only fill the cups half full, no more.  You should get 24 brownies with a nice balance of brownie to peanut butter cup. Do not overbake! Just bake these till a toothpick comes out ALMOST clean (mine took just 18 minutes). These are fudgey, gooey, delightfully cute, just the right size and, for some reason I don't understand since this is, after all, a boxed mix, irresistably delicious. I agree with JENNIEMC1975's review.  ",

My family LOVED these brownies--they must because half of the pan is already missing.",

For the first batch, I used a regular sized muffin tin, but I thought the peanut butter cup got lost in the brownie and it just wasn't that great.  The next batch I made mini muffins and these were fantastic!!  I made sure I watched them carefully so the tops didn't get too hard.  They came out so freakin' good!  Will definitely make these again!",
