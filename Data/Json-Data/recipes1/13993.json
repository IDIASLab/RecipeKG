After tasting these I know I will always make the frosting this way! I also replaced 1/4 c. of the butter with 1/4 c. peanut butter and let me tell you, the result was this beautiful, gooey \"stuff\" that looked like caramel ice cream topping. Thinking the brownies could use a little garnish or decoration, I sprinkled more of the swirled milk chocolate and peanut butter chips over the top. So pretty! Taste is what really matters, however, so I cut myself a tiny piece to \"test\" them and man oh man, what another happy surprise!  I didn't expect them to be THAT good! This milk chocolatey, peanut buttery frosting sets up nicely in the refrigerator but is still gooey, and is the perfect finish on the chewy, fudgey brownie beneath. That \"taste\" was so darn good it ended up being the equivalent of two brownies. My only criticism is that the title doesn't do these deliciously decadent brownies justice! ",

I did add a healthy dollop of peanut butter to the frosting to make sure it had a nice peanut flavor. I like these best when they're cold because the peanut butter isn't so overwhelming, but bf likes them better warm. **UPDATE** I had to change this to 5 stars because my boyfriend took these to work and his coworkers said they would pay me to make these again this week. If a bunch of grown men offer to pay $20 for a brownie, it's gotta be a 5 star. :)",

I took these to a friends house for dinner and everyone loved them! I added a 1/2 cup each of peanut butter and semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter and I also added about 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the frosting like others suggested. They turned out GREAT! Before I added the peanut butter to the frosting, it was way too sweet, but the peanut butter made it just right. The frosting turns hard once it's in the fridge but it's still SO good. We also tried heating a brownie in the microwave for about 20 seconds and the frosting melted just a little and dripped down the sides of the brownie...SO GOOD! I will definitely make these again! Hope this helps!",
