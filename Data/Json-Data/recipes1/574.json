I have been searching a long time for a recipe that will make me never want to buy bars again and this one has blown me away. I couldn't stop eating the dough haha! I used all spelt flour (LOVE the taste of it and it's so healthy!) and only half the amount of molasses because I ran out. The flavors are so complimentary to eachother. I tried lots of add-ins like chocolate chips craisins walnuts pecans golden raisins... YUM! Also to 1/4 of the batch I added 1 small banana with walnuts. MMMM it tastes like REALLY GOOD flavorful banana bread!!! Thanks so much for a recipe that will be a forever favorite:)",

Next time I will use all whole weat cut the sugar in half and leave out raisins and add more nutty items like sunflower seeds etc. by the way hubby loves them. He would give them 5 stars.
