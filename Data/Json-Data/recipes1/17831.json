I paired it with your perfect mashed potato recipe, wonderful by the way, and some grilled sweet peppers tossed with olive oil and butter pecan infused balsamic vinegar. All three of my kids have had seconds. I quadrupled the recipe making 1/2 of it now and freezing the meat mixture for another time. WOW, can't wait to try more of your recipes. You're AWESOME :-)",

                "reviewBody": "Wanted to offer adventuresome guests an alternative from standard meatballs and sauce and these lamb meatballs did the trick. The slightly spicy eggplant tomato sauce exceptionally distinguishes this dish from a traditional marinara sauce. A side shaker of grated Pecorino Romano cheese added another level of outstanding flavor to those choosing to use it. The quantity of sauce seemed well proportioned given that we didn t serve this over pasta or rice. Several people requested the recipe and Chef John adds another cleverly inventive recipe to his already large collection.",
