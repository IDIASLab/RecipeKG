I haven't done it yet but I think I'll try using the liqued to boil rice.  \n\nI have been boiling ribs and chicken like this for years and years.  I always add a generous amount of garlic powder, ground pepper and 1 onion cut into wedges.  My secret ingredient is to add a good amount of soy sauce 1/2-1 C approx.  Boil for 45 mins-1 hour.  Turn off heat, cover pan and let ribs marinate in the broth for several hours (I have let them sit for 4-5 hours).  Great to put in the oven especially during the winter months, but best on the grill.  If you want to make ahead put cooled ribs into plastic bag and add enough BBQ sauce to coat well.  Refrigerate until ready to use and then cook with additional sauce.  Try this with chicken--you will love it.  Just reduce the boiling time.",

I DID modify the cooking time: I boiled for only 1 hour and then cooked in the oven for only an hour as well. I wanted the meat tender but not falling completely off the bone as you picked it up, so I cut down on the cooking time (the meat still falling off the bone, but only while you were eating them, not while you were handling them). I also used pork baby back ribs, if that helps any of you... When boiling, I added salt and pepper, garlic and onion powder, and adobo seasoning. I did use a lot of seasoning, too (probably a teaspoon of each if not more - I used a big lobster pot to boil them in). I took some reviewers recommendations and I used the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. They have 3 or 4 different flavors, and instead of picking just one, I chose 3 different kinds and mixed them together: spicy, honey BBQ, and regular. Buy one bottle of sauce per rack of ribs you make, and buy one extra bottle as well! Some here basted theirs many times - I found that I only needed to do that twice. I cooked them in the oven for 30 mins, flipped them, recoated with sauce, and cooked another 30 minutes. And, I did all of this the night before a party. The day of the party, I separated all the ribs and cooked them for an additional 15 minutes on the BBQ... They were UNBELIEVABLE. I hope this info helps!!!",

I also followed the advice of others and put more BBQ sauce on the tops about 20 minutes before I took them out of the oven.  A note to others...this only makes 4 SMALL portions/about 4 ribs each.  I think everyone was left wanting more and not quite full. The ribs did come out incredibly tender and falling off the bone!  I will definitely make again!!",

I boiled these with the seasoning for one hour. During that time I prepared my own BBQ Sauce (5 tbs ketchup, 5 tbs brown sugar, 2 tbs vinegar, 1 tbs lemon juice, 2 Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon: salt, dry mustard powder and chili powder) After mixing it together and heating it up for a bit, I poured it over the ribs, and baked it for 1 & 1/2 hours. It makes them very sweet and juicy. I will make again and again! Thank you!",

To enhance the flavor, cover the meat in equal parts beef broth and water, add one bottle of a \"better\" bbq sauce, (using a cheap variety will only give a vinegar like flavor to the ribs) add 5 cloves of finely sliced garlic, two onions cut into 8 parts, top 1/3 of a head of celery to include the celery leaves, and 1/4 cup worcheshire sauce.  Turn off the stove after 1 hour on a low, slow boil and let sit for 1+ hours.  Take out and place on a cookie sheet and lightly coat them with additional sauce until you are ready to finish them on the grill.  Absolutely superb!!!",

So when my husband asked me to cook something for his work potluck I wanted to hit it out of the ball park. After studying the reviews for a week I produced the \"Best F'in Ribs\" (Guys at DH's work)\nI purchased 2 slabs of pork spare ribs (6.5 lbs) from Sams club and asked the butcher to cut them into sections of 3 for me (free) \nI BOILED WATER FIRST in a large stock pot and layered the ribs inside then I added: 3 TBSP g. powder, 3 Tsp of Pepper, about a TBSP Worchester sauce, 1 cup soy sauce, and 5-6 dashs of liquid smoke. \nI boiled for 1 hr. Then shut off the heat and covered and let it sit in the liquid for 1 hr 45 min.\nI purchased a square roasting tray from the dollar store (easy clean up and didn't have to nag DH about bringing back any dishs). I layerd the ribs in the tray (meaty side up) and brushed generously with a cup of Cattlemans BBQ Sauce. Covered with foil and cooked for 45 mins. Took it out flipped the ribs (at this point its difficult since they're falling off the bone) and lathered with another cup of BBQ sauce. Covered and cooked for another 1/2 hr. Then I flipped them again added BBQ drippings from the tray and broiled for 6-8 mins on high to give it a charred look. Covered with foil and sent DH to work along with a roll of napkins. He works the midnight shift and by the next day the word had gotten around to to 2 other shifts of my \"F'in Good ribs\". I'm so proud of myself!",
