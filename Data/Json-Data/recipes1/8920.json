Instead of white sugar I used brown sugar for the streusel and it added just enough sweetness without overpowering the cake. Thanks for a good recipe! When mixing a cake like this it's critical to follow the recipe's instructions to \"stir\" the wet and dry ingredients together not use the mixer. Over mixing is a common error with these kinds of cakes (quick breads and muffins too) and that leads to a tough and therefore dry cake (bread muffin). That may be the reason some of the other reviewers' cakes were not as moist. Hope this helps.",

(wonderful)\nThen the last two time's I added 2 med. size banana's... It was so good that way.. Everyone was asking for the recipe..\n\nOne time I made it I didn't have any sour cream so I added sour milk.. It still worked out perfect... \n\nGive it a try. I'm sure you will love it.\n\nI have tried some coffe cake's and they seem to be a little dry.. This one is not...\n\nThank you for sharing your recipe with us.....",

I searched for a recipe similar to that of his mother's. This is the closest according to him. His Mom used to make hers with Bisquick. I like this better as is has more of a cake texture and that hint of sweet. I used brown sugar and pecans for my \"swirl\" mix and it is sooooo good. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE! Thanks Allison!

It tops my mother-in-law's coffee cake by a mile but we will keep that to ourselves. Just yesterday I made a third one (in 2 months) and added a tbsp more of sour cream. Wow is this a moist cake. I cooked it only 50 minutes and its even more moist than the last 2! My husband is swimming one mile four times a week just to enjoy a slice (or two) each day. My four year old daughter finally loves walnuts thanks to this recipe. Now we are going to try it again but add chocolate chips! Make this recipe and you'll keep those who love you loving you!",
