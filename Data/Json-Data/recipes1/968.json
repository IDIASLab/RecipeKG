One way to avoid having to refridgerate it over night is to lay each side of the graham cracker squares in milk for a few seconds until slightly soft, right before laying them on the cake. This keeps them moist and it's ready to serve right then. We used our own topping instead of the frosting: 3T Butter, 3T. Hot water, 3T Cocoa powder and about 1 and 1/2 cup powdered sugar (to desired thickness)Just pour over the top. This creates a thin layer of chocolate and makes it much more elegant in my opinion!",

                "reviewBody": "I'm giving this 4 stars b/c I thought it was ok, but my guests loved it.  I had a version of this before that was absolutely delicious, but I don't think this recipe was as good.  Part of it may be that it was barely fridged for 4 hours, so possibly if it had \"sat\" longer, it would've tasted better.  I also used cinnamon graham crackers b/c that's all I had, and I personally didn't like the cinnamon flavor in the cake, but other people thought it was a great touch.  I think some great variations would be to make it like tiramisu with some coffee flavoring, b/c overall it just tasted plain to me - sweet - but plain in flavor.  The version I had eaten before had vanilla and chocolate layers.  I may try that next time, maybe even add some coffee into the mix.\nUPDATE:\nI made a variation with chocolate graham crackers and Fat/sugar free cheesecake pudding w/ dark chocolate frosting.  It was REALLY good.  The tip to heat up the frosting is a must since it's SO much easier that way and you end up getting a nice smooth, shiny coating just like an eclair.  Also, I would recommend making this in a big rectangular tupperware so that you can just snap the lid on top.  I kept finding my saran wrap would \"suction\" itself to my frosting when I made it in a pan and not look as pretty.  It's also essential to let the cake sit for at least overnight.  This version sat for 2 days and the texture was just WAY better than the first one I made which barely sat for 4 hours as the recipe stated.",

My family and I thought the store-bought frosting I put on the first one was way too sweet, as well as way too much.  Also, I used cheesecake flavored pudding on the first one and we didn't really care for that flavor either.  This time I decided to use the vanilla flavor pudding (as per recipe) and make a chocolate ganache for the topping.  OMG heaven!!  I made it the night before to allow the flavors to set and took it to a potluck at work.  Everyone was fighting over the leftovers & they all wanted the recipe.  I cannot begin to describe how delicious this is for such a simple dessert (took less than 10 minutes to put together).  I think the ganache is what really made the difference this time.  (2/3 cup heavy whipping cream brought just to a boil, then pour over 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips...I used Ghirardelli, whisk until smooth and pour over cake.  Then allow to refrigerate overnight to set.)  You have to try this recipe...trust me, you won't be disappointed!",
