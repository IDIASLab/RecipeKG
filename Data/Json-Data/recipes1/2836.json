First, chop a large onion and mince (about) 3 cloves garlic.  Coarsely chop 1 pound mushrooms (any variety you prefer) and saute along with onion and garlic until soft.  Add mixture to the rest of meatloaf ingredients along with 1 teaspoon salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Mix everything together well and set aside in the refrigerator for 2 hours for flavors to meld.  It's also better to do a free-form loaf rather than baking it in a pan as it a free-form loaf browns better and allows excess fat to drain off.  Follow the above modifications for an outstanding meatloaf.  We served the meatloaf with the Awesome and Easy Creamy Corn Casserole (also from Allrecipes.com), grilled asparagus and baked potatoes.",

Since some people said this was dry, I only used one cup of stuffing mix.  For more flavor I chopped fine one carrot, half a stalk of celery, some red onion, two cloves of pressed garlic, and a little dry thyme (did not saute-they cook up nicely while the meatloaf bakes).  All the other ingredients I left the same.  Then I used half a can of whole cranberry sauce, 1/4 cup catsup, and 1/4 cup mustard to glaze.  This made for a healthy (for meatloaf) main dish that my husband raved about.    ",

I'm glad I did! It was FANTASTIC. Here's what I did:\n\nI used 20 ounces of turkey, and a 6 oz package of turkey stuffing. I mixed two cups of the stuffing (2/3 of the package) with a cup of water (about the proper amount per the package, minus a bit to allow for turkey juices), plus 1/2 tsp chicken bouillon.  To this I added the turkey, one egg, one stalk of celery chopped small, about the same amount of diced yellow onion, and the following seasonings: garlic, marjoram, thyme, rosemary, ginger, white pepper, celery salt, and sea salt. These were eyeballed. I was liberal with the salt and garlic - a few decent shakes of the rosemary, thyme, and white pepper, and small dashes of the marjoram, ginger, and celery salt. I plunked it in a loaf pan and kind of settled it down in with a spoon making ridges in the top (so it wasn't domed). The remaining cup of stuffing I mixed with 2/3 cup of water and poured over the loaf. I recommend baking to the internal temperature - mine took longer than an hour. I did make turkey gravy to pour over top, but it didn't need it! It was flavorful and moist! Hubs (picky) went back for seconds! As an added plus, it looked GORGEOUS with the baked stuffing on top. YUMMY!\n\n(I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't the actual recipe. What I did make I would definitely give 5 stars.)",
