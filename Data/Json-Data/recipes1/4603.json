I thought this dish would be safest pasta and cheese. Who doesn't like pasta and cheese? It turned out awesome! I added some mizithra to the mix which is just what it needed. Also not sure if it is clear in the instructions but it is even better if you brown the butter (and use BUTTER not that margarine stuff)",

You could spruce it up with some sauteed spinach-saute it with the roasted garlic maybe. Anyway this recipe is simple and with good basic ingredients very good.",

For the garlic butter if you use margarine and garlic powder it's going to taste like margarine and garlic powder... kinda like the frozen garlic bread you get at the grocery. If you want a more upscale flavor use real butter and minced roasted garlic. A half cup of butter is a LOT of butter so you might want to cut that back. I only used 2 Tbsp butter and found it to be fine. Also keep in mind you're using a lot of cheese which will release some fat when it's cooked. If just cheese and pasta sounds a little rich (I thought it was) feel free to toss in veggies of your choice. I like artichoke hearts sun dried tomatoes kalamata olives onion spinach etc. Overall it's a good dish and a nice change from the same old spaghetti.",
