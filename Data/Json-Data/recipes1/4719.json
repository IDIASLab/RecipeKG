Also I used a large can of peeled whole tomatoes cut in half fresh vine-ripes were 3.99 per lb. I opted for the 1.99 can and it was just fine. I topped with shredded jack cheese and a little cilantro over white rice to soak up the broth. We also enjoyed a nice cold ale with it yum!",

Also remember if your going to make a large batch and leave it in the fridge for a few days it will get spicier as the chillies sit in the stew. I did this in a slow cooker to really get the richness of the flavor. I filled the pot with chicken stock and sherry in the same proportionate amount but enough to make sure the chicken was covered. First I slow cooked the chicken on low in the broth for 3 hours before adding the other ingredients. The recipe suggests only quartering the onion but since I wanted to leave the onion in the soup I cut into more comfortable bite size pieces. Next I peeled 10 garlic cloves (slow cookers require increasing the aromatics). I threw these into a pan and cooked on medium high covered until the onions started \"sweating\". This releases a lot of the oils inside them before they enter the lower temperature of the slow cooker letting them penetrate better. When there was two hours left I added the tomatoes. I also added the chili. Tomatoe cook faster then onion and garlic. In the last hour I added the 2 tsp thyme and 1/2 tablespoon of thyme olive oil we had made. I tasted it to see if it needed anymore chili and decided it was fine. Wonderful winter soup so nice to have after a cold day.",
