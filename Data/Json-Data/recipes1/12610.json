Don't use large, woody zucchini, but nice, young tender ones.  The fresher the ricotta, the better. How much you reduce the wine depends on your ricotta:  if you have fresh, slightly runny ricotta you need to let the wine reduce a little more than half, maybe two thirds, or your end product will be runny.  And use a pasta with nooks to hold the sauce.",
