Added 4 times as many olives as the original used 2 garlic cloves cut some small bell pepper wedges and sauteed them with the onion and garlic. I also added about a 1/2 cup of kraft italian dressing and 2 T of vinegar. Plus extra pepper and salt and garlic salt. I didn't heat up the ingredients though but kept it as a cold salad and let it sit in the refridgerator for 2 hours before serving. Magnificent! (I could see how this could be a warm salad but only if the cheese was heated just to soft - not melted.) A great summer pasta salad.",

I didn't use fresh basil because it was too expensive. I just added dried basil to the sauce I made for it (about 1/4 cup olive oil with about a 1/3 of red wine vinegar dash of salt and pepper (or to taste)). I mixed the sauce in with the chopped veggies And then added it to the fresh cooked pasta. I stirred that around to make sure it was dressed nicely and then added about 3/4 cup of parmesan and a bit more mozzarella than it called for. Added a bit more salt and pepper and it was perfect!
