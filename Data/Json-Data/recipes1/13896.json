The only change was I probably ground up more than the 4 1/2 cups of rice krispies. I got carried away..more like 5 1/2. You couldn't really taste the rice cereal but it enhanced the taste of the cookie into something great. Oh I did add 1 tsp of baking powder as well as the baking soda because I love my cookies nice and puffy. GREAT SHARE!",

I know some people have said the Rice Krispies give the cookies an odd crunch but apparently they're not grinding up the Rice Krispies fine enough. The cereal should be ground down to the consistancy of a fine ground cornmeal. It's the flavor of the Rice Krispies that makes these cookies so wonderful not the crunch. The type of cookie sheet you have will determine how long you need to bake them. I have shiny restaurant quality heavyweight baking pans and it took 13 to 14 minutes for the cookies to get done. Darker and lightweight pans will probably require less time maybe 10-12 minutes.",
