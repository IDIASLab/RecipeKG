Layer chicken swiss cheese and then pour over your sauce- add a little ground pepper. Top with bread crumbs and drizzle with melted butter. These minor adjustments bring up the flavor quite a bit. This dish goes great with rice pilaf and green beans! This is one of our favorites.",

Our family is now two people so I do this as a two person dish - one whole chicken breast will make two meals - one for now - one for later. I use cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 can of white wine (or chicken broth if you prefer) and combine them. I use croutons instead of bread crumbs - any flavor you like. I also use baby bella mushrooms sliced. So I put down chicken mushrooms swiss cheese slices croutons soup/wine mixture and later top with more swiss cheese. All in all the recipe is very good.

I started by pounding out 3 very large chicken breasts and then cutting them in half. I sauted crimini mushrooms and vidalia onions in a bit of EVOO and then deglazed the skillet with white wine and continued cooking the mushrooms until just firm. Removed the mushroom/onion mixture to a plate and then sauted the seasoned chicken breasts just until slightly browned (not cooked all they way through). I removed the chicken breasts from the skillet added back in the mushroom/onion mix. I then mixed the soup (98% fat free) with 1/2 cup of white wine and poured that over and added the chicken breasts back in. Placed 1/2 pieces of 50% reduced fat swiss cheese on the chicken and then just sprinkled with some italian seasoned bread crumbs. Used about 3 T of butter to cover. I then covered the skillet and baked for 30 minutes. Took the cover off baked for 15 more minutes. I served with roasted red potatoes and fresh french bread. I would make it this way for important company it was seriously that good. I know it's a few changes but they are well worth making!! Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.",
