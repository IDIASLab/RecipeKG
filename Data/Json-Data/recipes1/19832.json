So I make larger batch of this portion out in small containers and freeze also. When I need my popper fix I have this ready to use too! I don't bother with fresh jalapeno just add chipotle chilis and some of the adobo to my liking. I also use seedless low sugar raspberry jam. I do add a bit of crushed garlic a splash of white balsamic vinegar and sea salt. I'll have to try it out with chicken wings. This would be a great glaze on roast pork over a brick of crm cheese w/crackers or well...lots of applications. Easy to make I love it.",

I might try it again with less jalape\u00f1o and perhaps cut the jam in half but add fresh pureed raspberries in the place of the reduced jam to produce a sauce that is a bit less sweet. Very interesting though. I recommend others give it a try.",
