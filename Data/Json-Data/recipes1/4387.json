I unfortunately did not have all ingredients to hand so I made the following substitutions/revisions: 1) Because I'm impatient instead of soaking the split peas overnight I started them cooking first then just added the ingredients as I got them ready. 2) Used about 2-3 cup of diced fresh cooked ham on the bone. 3) I had a HUGE green chili pepper so I removed the seeds first diced it up and then sauteed it with the onions. 4) Didn't have any bitters so I added about 1/2 cup of pumpkin ale. 5) At the tail end I added about 2 teaspoons of curry. (The soup tasted great as is I just felt like curry is all.) Thanks for the new and interesting twist on split peas!",

I made the soup without it and didn t miss it... possibly because i didn t know what it was? Oh well. Also I used green split peas not yellow. And added carrots for that extra vitamin boost. Also added rosemary and sage. Tasted like thanksgiving:)",
