I soak it in cold salted water for about an hour before cooking (I can't remember why I just learned to do that when preparing heart). I too added garlic. If you don't have red wine red wine vinegar works well too. I've made it with apple cider vinegar once in a pinch and it was good. Also just about any root vegetable works well.",

My only change was to add two cloves of garlic which I'm glad I did. It just seemed to lack a flavor to really marry with the somewhat strong flavor of the beef (which is not unpleasant just stronger beefy flavor than I'm used to.) It seemed to require a lot of salt and I'm not sure why. Also the sauce didn't thicken up as much as I expected it to so it was kind of watery. If I get the opportunity to try this again I'll add more carrots more garlic a splash of worcestershire lots of salt and probably do the braise in a crock pot instead of on the stove and see how it goes from there. I'll probably also hold back some beef stock to add a thickener to to boost the consistency of the sauce. That said I recommend trying this recipe as is before making too many changes. You really need to see what flavors will work for your family before just going off of my opinion. Lola thanks for posting a recipe for an unusual cut!",

I used grass-fed beef heart and the taste didn't seem strong...If I hadn't of been the one who made it I would never had known it was beef heart. It reminded me of a pot roast. Very good meal. My kids ate this up: ages 1 2 and 3. UPDATE: Have made this a couple more times... Take your time to get the veins/arteries/ skin off as much as you can. It will make a difference. The second time I made this I was in a rush...the meat was tougher to chew. Take your time. Do it right. I am making this tonight. I had all the ingredients (including homemade beef broth) and I just can't wait to eat this!",

Instead of simmering on the stove top I used a cast iron pot and baked it on 350 for about 1.5 hours.

I added more boullion to make it a bit more liquidy because I knew that the sauce would come out delicious and could be scooped up with toasted baguettes. Great wine recommendation- a strong red really enhances the heart's strong flavor. And the meat is available at my supermarket at one-fourth the price of fancier beef cuts. Merci!",
