I lightly browned the seitan in a couple tablespoons of canola oil. Seitan is a high-protein veggie meat made primarily from wheat gluten; it's available in Whole Foods-type stores and sometimes \"regular\" grocery stores. In recipes it has a taste and texture similar to chicken. There are lots of recipes for it online but I always buy it ready-made from a package. I also used Follow Your Heart vegan cheddar (though my first choice had I not had leftovers to use up would have been Daiya vegan cheddar). - Mindful of other reviewers' comments I added some garlic powder to the mixture as well as some corn starch for thickening. I served it kind of half over half next to rice for which I added a bit of Mexcan spices to the broth. I lightly spooned salsa verde on top of the dish.",
