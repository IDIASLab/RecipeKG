At 15 minutes, my oven was billowing smoke due to butter bubbling out on the oven floor. Next time I might put a rimmed cookie sheet underneath. I used two 6-hole cupcake tins, average size, filled 3/4 way, and got 11 popovers which we scarfed down with pea soup. I'll use this method again, and experiment with tin sizes and possibly with my antique cast iron popover pans. Thank you, Chef John",

Using this recipe, as written, mine did not POP as much as much as they usually do and I attribute that to a couple of things.  First, I usually use either Wondra flour or cake flour - also non fat milk - Cold oven and bake at 425.  The lighter the ingredients the high they will rise.  My bake time is usually about 25 minutes.  They were crispy and very tasty, just not as tall as I would have expected.  BTW - this made 9 popovers with a little batter to spare.",

These popped beautifully, into  fluffy balloons, actually mine looked better than the picture above! Next time I will cook a little less 24-25 mins, as they browned quickly and I like the softer pudding middle texture. I have found that if you decrease the salt, your popovers will not pop, do not not over mix, and always use room temp. ingredients( I never have that time so pop the eggs into warm water before cracking and nuke the milk for a minute on very low). I used a muffin tin for these and you never would believe that they were not out of a pop over tin, so big and puffy. Most recipes call for a pre-heated tin, so I am amazed that these worked so well.",
