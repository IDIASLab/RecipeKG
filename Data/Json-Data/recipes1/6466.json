I made them exactly as directed except for cooking the noodle pancakes over medium-high heat not high. They were burning on high. I let them fry for about 3 min on either side. This time may vary depending on how well your pan conducts heat. I will make these again and again and again! It is much easier than it sounds and totally worth it!",

It will definitely be one of my mainstays.",

I wasn't sure if I had the right noodles and I needed to really press them down while cooking to get them to stay together as pancakes but the end result was a very unique and delightful taste and texture. I also substituted broccoli for the asparagus just because good asparagus is hard to find in February and the broccoli was very good. I'm sure I'd also enjoy this with asparagus but I feel like the veggies can be varied to suit what you have and prefer.",
