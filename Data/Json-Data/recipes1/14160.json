And now I think I will never make any other kind of banana muffins again. These are just the best that I have ever tasted. I was actually worried that they might be too healthy - after all they are almost fat-free and very lightly sweetened with honey. But they don't taste like low-calorie muffins (and in fact they aren't any lower in calories than regular muffins though I'm sure they are healthier). I suppose they might not appeal to everyone but if you're the type of person that likes bran muffins try these - you will not be disappointed.",
