Since returning I have craved it and have been disappointed by the American version which resembles Chili with pasta. This recipe is as close as I could find with few minor changes: I omitted the tomato juice and used 1 can of crushed tomatoes instead. I used Great Northern Beans instead of the red beans. I used fresh basil. I used Acini de pepe pasta. I added 1 cup fresh chopped spinach. I also added 2 more cups of chicken broth. Delicious!!",

Also, I didn't have tomato juice, so I used two cans of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce.  Lastly, I threw in a little brown sugar to carmelize the onions as they were sauteing.  Lastly, top with freshly grated parmesean!  Fabulous!  (I tried the recipe exactly as written the first time, but it was bland, so I couldn't quite give it a full 5 stars).",
