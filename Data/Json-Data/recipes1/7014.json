                "reviewBody": "My kids love this bread.  Here are some hints for Robert from Georgia and any new bread bakers.  First of all, use fresh, tasty ingredients.  Often, locally grown flours will taste best to you.  Filter your water before using it.  So, first put the salt, olive oil, and honey into a large mixing bowl.  Then put the water in a saucepan and add the cornmeal.  While stirring it constantly, bring the cornmeal to a low boil and boil it for 5 minutes.  If you aren't attentive enough, you will get lumps that will need to be picked out during the kneading process.  Add the cooked cornmeal to the mixing bowl and stir until thoroughly blended.  If you have a candy thermometer, stir the mixture until it cools to between 110 and 115 degrees.  If you don't have a thermometer, continue to stir just until there is no more steam coming from the mixture.  This is the time to add the yeast.  Stir in the yeast and let it rest for 10 minutes.  While you are waiting, prepare your flours by sticking a whisk into the flour bag and whisking the flour to fluff it up.  Now add a large cup of rye flour to the bubbly cornmeal yeast mixture and stir it in.  Then add a large cup of whole wheat flour and mix it in.  Next, add all-purpose flour 1 cup at a time until the dough isn't too sticky (probably 3 or 4 cups).  Then sprinkle lots of flour onto your kneading board and scrape all of the dough out of the bowl.  Set your timer for 10 minutes and start kneading the dough, continually sprinkling generous amo",

I used approx. 6 1/2 cups (without changing anything else) and found that perfect. I just couldn't imagine kneading any more into it. Other reviewers mentioned multiple risings which I didn't find necessary. After mixing and kneading I put them in the pans let rise 40 minutes and then baked - how quick and easy! Very nice taste and texture.",

                "reviewBody": "Awesome!! A very tender bread with nice flavour.\n\nLike other reviewers, I didn't use the full amount of flour. I subbed one cup of white flour with multigrain in addition to the rye and whole wheat and didn't keep track of the white flour used. I'd guess maybe 5 cups at the most but am not sure. I didn't like the look of the mixture just after adding the yeast so I threw it out and did it again, this time doing the yeast like all the other recipes I've used have called for - sprinkling the yeast in warm water and letting it sit for a few minutes. I reserved some of the water for the cornmeal before cooking it and used that for my yeast. Don't know if it makes any difference or not.\n\nSomeone commented that the crust was rather hard. After taking the bread out of the oven, I've always brushed the tops with melted butter. I find it makes the tops look golden and gives them a nice sheen as well as softens the crust.\n\nI've just eaten my first slice and it is a nice tender bread. Not bland, with a very subtle taste of honey. I expect that the flavours will be more pronounced after the bread sits overnight, as most loaves taste even better the next day.\n\nFive stars because the only issue seems to be the amount of flour if the recipe is followed as written.",

I'm so glad I made it! It had a wonderful smooth texture unlike any other multigrain bread I've made before - due of course to the fact that you cook the cornmeal first. The key I think is to add only a little white flour at first (2 cups maybe when the other flours are added) mixing in more as you knead the bread. This is certainly one of best bread recipes I've ever made!",
