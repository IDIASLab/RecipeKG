I also ran out of peanut butter so I only added 1/2 cup to the chocolate layer. I did increase the chocolate chips a bit on top to balance the peanut butter base. It actually turned out pretty darn GOOD! My kids looked like they had died and gone to heaven when I served them. My husband thought they were way too rich to be brownie-sized. I just cut them into 1 1/2 inch squares (no bigger) and they are great small pieces of heaven-(if you are into peanut butter and chocolate like I am). I'd totally make this again!",

Where I'm living graham crackers can't be found so I substituted chocolate cookies. The cookies had chocolate chips in them and I think that made the base softer and wetter than it should have been. If I make this recipe again I'll use plain cookies to balance out the strong sweet flavor of the chocolate peanut butter top layer.",
