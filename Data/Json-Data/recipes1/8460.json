I did find, however, that 2 (10.75oz) packages of pound cake is more accurate for the layering.",

Also if anyone of you are confused on how much coffee to use per water.  I used 6 Tablespoons of coffee and brewed it with one cup of water.  I was rather nervous thinking it may to strong.  But it was perfect.  I also make mine the night before and I think that was also the key.  I will be making this again and again.  And I may not always used the chocolate toffee bits maybe cocoa and a bittersweet chocolate bar shaved.  It was great. Thanks",

(1) I use the larger (16 oz) frozen pound cake and cut into 12 slices which fits perfectly in a 9\" x 13\" dish. (2) I use only 1 cup of heavy cream which makes a heavier textured filling (using the 2 cups is why so many reviewers had to whip it up separately & then add to the cream cheese mixture). The two cup amount of cream just drowns the cake in \"filling\"; the one-cup amount gives it a nice custard-like layer. (3) I get a couple of Heath bars and chop them up for the topping. I found that when we use the toffee chips (like \"Skor\") they do not stay crunchy for very long. It may not be a true traditional tiramisu but it is VERY tasty very easy and very different from the usual desserts!",
