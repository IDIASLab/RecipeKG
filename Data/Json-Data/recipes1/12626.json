                "reviewBody": "I noticed there were no reviews from someone saying they are Indian.  So here I am.  I tried this out because I was curious about the creamed corn base - all of my curries use tomatoes.  I used the ingredients requested with 3 exceptions.  1 - garlic salt 2 - a can of diced tomatoes because the corn started sticking 3 - homemade paneer instead of tofu - but only because I had none, I've used tofu in curry before & as other reviewers have said, you need to brown it first with a little bit of oil, then take it out of the pan while you move onto the onions.  I always put the cheese/tofu in last so they stay whole. In regards to curry paste.  I noticed quite a few who were unable to use it reviewed a few years back.  In the past 2 or 3 years, most major grocers carry curry paste - it's different from curry sauce.  Also, other reviewers have mentioned this, the brand makes a HUGE difference.  I only use Patak's.  I'm always trying different brands because I like to think of myself as a lover of shortcuts - curry paste is one of them.  I've used Patak's faithfully ever since I left my parents and missed authentic South Indian cooking (spicy flavorful & spicy hot).  I used a medium hot paste because I'm not sure how much my 18 month can do - it must have been just right because she inhaled it as did my 5 year old. As far as measurements go - I don't use them. The beauty of curry is it's YOUR special blend. I'm writing home about this one!",

While sauteeing the onions I added 1/2 tsp of garam masala and 1/2 tsp of ground cumin which I think boosted the flavor dramatically. I followed the recipe exactly and added some boiled potato and cauliflower. I served it with basmati rice and it came out wonderful! Very mild also as I have a very hard time eating spicy indian cuisine but definitly not lacking in flavor! I'm very grateful for this wonderful recipe.",
