I know how people hate when others tweak recipes but I just couldn't bring myself to use the shortening.  Instead, I subbed 1/2 c. peanut butter and 1/4 c. butter.  Rather than using 1 c. of white sugar, I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar.  I also added 3/4 c. chocolate chips and omitted the nuts.  These were amazing!  It's a cookie that is somewhat healthier than the standard chocolate chip but is just as delicious!  Next time I may try using agave nectar instead of sugar to make it even healthier.  Thanks for providing a yummy alternative to a regular oatmeal raisin cookie.  :)",
