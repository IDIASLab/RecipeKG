I was a bit too late for New Year's but there would have been my peas and greens in one swoop!: )",

I switched it up a little and used the southern seasoned black eyed peas and since I'm not a fan of the \"cheese\" from this recipe, I used a good English cheddar and cut that into small cubes and melted that into the other ingredients.  I also added minced jalape\u00f1o (I had a jar of jalape\u00f1o slices that I minced up - it was probably close to a 2 tsp.).  SUPER GOOD!",
