We don't melt any chocolate chips for the cookie dough though. The recipe that we use is very similar. The only other changes are twice as much butter twice the flour omitting the baking powder and adding 1 tsp. baking soda. The mini peppermint patties we leave whole. Chilling the dough for two hours will help alot. Wrap the dough around the patty and then put the shaped cookies in the refrigerator to chill again while the oven preheats. Baking this on parchment lined baking sheets helps also. I hope this helps others. I know that there is alot of prep involved but the cookies are great.",

Instead of wrapping the dough around the mint I just pushed one into the top of the dropped dough. This way they came out perfect no leaking and a great big mint-chocolate centre. I do not use the icing sugar as it would be hard to roll this batter into a ball. I drop by TBSP onto a cookie sheet so it makes about 18 cookies. Really easy and very yummy. Try it!",

Jr. Mints have a more liquid center and will leak out of the cookie dough making a big mess and making the dough crunchy- almost candy like. 2) Prepare dough and chill it for a half hour to an hour before attempting to wrap it around the quartered peppermint pattie. 3) Use parchment paper when baking to keep cookies from sticking to cookie sheet.",

Make a bigger cookie and be sure to cover your mint completely. I didn't have any leakage. I used regular semi sweet chips in the sugar mixture and mini semi sweet in the dough. I just thought that there was way too much mint in this recipe for my tastes. Great holiday cookie! Thanks!",

I also could not find mint chips so I used semi sweet and added peppermint extract until they were to my liking. I have also found that if you don't want that minty mess all over your cookie sheets then you have to make your cookies bigger. I only get about 2 dozen cookies but I have not had the melted mess problem since I made them bigger. I also used spoons to get the peppermint patty in the center so that I didn't get completely messy. I also do not roll them a second time in the powdered sugar I sprinkle the powdered sugar on with a flour sifter after baking them. I love this recipe and will use it again and I only gave it 4 stars because these cookies are a chore to make but if you are up to it they are really yummy!",
