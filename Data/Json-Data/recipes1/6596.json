Threw this sauce together in a zip-loc bag using dried onion flakes(amt about equal to soy sauce) and a goodly shot of minced garlic tossed in a couple of frozen chicken breasts and let them marinate and defrost for about 2-3 hrs. Then cooked on the George Forman and served with brown rice. Really good flavor and nice tang with some sweetness. Definitely will make again and want to try marinating longer with just a bit of pre-planning.",

For the marinade I used 1 tsp. of dried minced onion vs. regular onion and Heinz chili sauce vs. ketchup for a little extra kick. I also added some fresh minced garlic and 2 tsp. of smoked paprika to give it a little \"smoky flavor\". I mixed everything together and poured it over the chicken. I let it marinate overnight and grilled it over charcoal - excellent!",

Cons: Lacked enough flavor. I would marinade it longer (maybe overnight?) so that the flavor could really soak in. Very straightforward tasting too. I made this recipe on the george foreman and it worked pretty well. I then took onions and caramelized them with some extra marinade and put some on top for presentation and to add a little more to the dish.",
