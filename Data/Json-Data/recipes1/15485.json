But, when the kielbasa was thawed and the bag of kraut I thought was in the regfrigerator wasn't actually there, I was kind of in a bind.  I used the Pace medium salsa, tossed in about a half of an onion chopped that was sitting in the fridge and a little garlic along with the turmeric, and only used the kielbasa - no shrimp, no chicken.  It turned out great!  It had a nice heat level and the kielbasa and salsa really did go well together.  This is definitely one of those 'in a pinch' recipes that delivers a lot of flavor for a really minimal effort.  Toss a green salad while this is cooking and you have dinner in 20 minutes.",
