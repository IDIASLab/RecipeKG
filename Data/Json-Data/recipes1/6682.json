And I'm not the hugest Kahl\u00faa fan in the world... but man, I tellya, this cake was DE-LI-CIOUS. Moist, light, sweet (but not too sweet!), decadent and best of all ~ ~ ~ the finished cake is so easy to put together, yet it LOOKS like you spent SO MUCH MORE time on it...\n\nSimple ingredients, fantastic looking cake. You CANNOT mess this one up, folks. I was blown away.\n\nHere are my MINOR side-notes:\n\u2022 I used round cake pans, flattening the round top off - splitting each finished cake into four \"slices\". Made for an impressive, tall cake. \n\u2022 Reduced the amount of water by about a tablespoon where I could to boost the Kahl\u00faa by an equal amount, for a bit more kick.\n\u2022 I prefer toasted coconut to plain, added nice depth to the visual... just be careful not to char. I also garnished cake with chocolate-covered espresso beans. Yummy!!\n\nYou can't go wrong with this recipe. It is FANNNN-TASTIC. Went over brilliantly at a party over Christmas and it's going to make a work party (Mexican-food themed) that much more fun!!",

I baked mine in a culinge pan which when cake is baked the middle is hollow for a filling. I placed the pudding filling in the middle of the top and bottom layer instead of slicing each layer in half. I wanted to use my new pan and it worked very well. Once the cake was sliced you could see the pudding filling in the middle and cake all the way around. The fresh whipped cream and colored sprinkles made a beautiful presentation! Thanks!",
