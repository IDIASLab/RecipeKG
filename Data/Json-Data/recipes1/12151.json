I use four large boneless chops, 2 cloves of garlic, and half chicken broth/ half white wine for the 3/4 cup broth.  I also usually substitute 2 tsp. cajun seasoning for the 2 tsp. paprika.  The sauce can be a bit tricky!  Make sure you definitely reduce the juices by half, when you remove the chops, or the sauce won't be thick enough.  Also, once stirring in the sour cream, do not allow the mixture to boil, or it will separate, and ruin the sauce.  Once done, I serve chops and sauce over hot, buttered noodles.  Scrumptious!!  Thanks for a great favorite in our house!",

Also - I too added a splash of white wine and used 3 bay leaves and added some crushed dried rosemary. These three additions alone added great flavor to the chops. Finally I did need to add some cornstarch to the gravy so that it would thicken like we prefer - but no big deal. I was worried that my family would not be happy with a side dish of mashed potatoes two nights in a row BUT since I had this great gravy to pour over them: my family was very pleased. This is a great recipe Clyde - thanks for posting it!",

Instead of the two tsps. of paprika recommended I added ONE tsp. of SMOKED paprikia. Also I used fat free sour cream although at the end of cooking the sauce I added one heaping tspn. of cornstarch mixed with one tbsp. of water and added that mix to the sauce. We absolutely LOVED the flavor. Also we DID simmer the porkchops for an hour because we like them fork tender. WOW!! Great recipe. Thanks so much.",
