(I almost always make extra when grilling or broiling chicken steaks pork chops etc & then use them in salads pasta dishes soups stirfrys...the list is endless). For this recipe I used leftover turkey from Herb Roasted Turkey Breast (from this site) & cubed it. I scaled the recipe down to two since it was just me for lunch only I knew it was going to take a lot more than 1/2 cup of broth to cook the noodles so I added extra. Quite a bit actually as I had to keep adding it to keep it from running dry. I did not thaw the veggies (didn't see the point) & I used a large clove of roasted garlic instead of the powder. When the noodles were about half done I added the turkey & sprinkled on some Wondra flour (it's an instant flour used to thicken sauces & gravies)....very good & extremely quick...thanks Christine!",
