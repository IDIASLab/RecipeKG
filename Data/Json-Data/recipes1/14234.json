I cooked the salmon steak in the oven with butter garlic salt lemon pepper and cayenne pepper. It all turned out delicious. It was on my husbands plate a whole of 30 seconds!!",

I knew I just needed a couple additions and it was EXACTLY like the sauce we love.  I used 1/2 cup 1% milk and 1/4 cup half and half.  After bringing to boil, I put a big drop of yellow food color to give it a nice pale yellow tint. I did about 2 1/2 tbsp. of lemon (because that was the juice of a whole lemon).  At the end, I stirred in about a handful of finely diced fresh red bell pepper and about a heaping tbsp. of capers.  Not only did it taste great, the addition of the peppers, capers and food coloring made it look beautiful.  Thanks for sharing!  It made our crab cakes PERFECT!",
