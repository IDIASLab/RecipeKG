Here's the key:  bake in a 9x9 square pan so the bars will be thicker (think of it more like cake) You can't think of these as cookies, they are certainly more cake like.  Also, try using half white sugar and half brown sugar.  Finally, I add 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract ... gives it a nice flavor.",

I used 1.5 cup bananas (2 medium sized bananas) and decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup. I used 1/3 cup skim yogurt instead of milk, 1.5 tsp cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, 1 whole egg and 1 egg white instead of 2 egg whites to produce a gooey center. I also replaced the raisins with chopped walnuts. \r\nThis might contain a little more fats because of the egg yolk and walnuts, but i think it all evens out eventually and its soooo worth it. \r\nI made half into drop cookies and half into bars. The drop cookies taste wonderful with its soft center and crispy outer covering, but the bars come a very close second. Its best eaten warm right out of the oven. Thanks for posting this up!!",

But they were good enough that I didn't want to give up so the 2nd time I added 1/4 cup flour and 1/2 cup shredded coconut and substituted about 1/3 cup brown sugar for the white sugar still using an 11x7 pan. This time they definitely came out like cookie bars - a little denser but very moist and flavorful. I'm not sure if it was the flour or the coconut or both that made them stay together but they've been a hit -- easy to cut pick up and eat with sticky little hands. Thanks for a great idea. I think I'll try adding a nut butter next time.",

I used ground flax seed and water as an egg subsitute and substituted 1/2 maple syrup and 1/2 agave nectar for someone with senstivities to refined sugar. Because of all the liquid the batter was pretty gloppy so I added a few tablespoons of whole wheat flour. For what i was looking for they came out great. Since I wasn't looking for a cookie or cake recipe I may have had different expectations than others. I am sure I will make these again for weekday breakfasts.",
