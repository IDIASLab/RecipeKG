It pleased both the adult and children judges. I dipped the ends 3 different ways...assuring to garner the votes of the various judges. Ha! I dipped some in just plain chocolate on both ends some in chocolate with nuts and the remainder in chocolate then in red and white non pareil balls which made for a festive eye catching cookie. The recipe is good the way it is but it is a fairly soft dough because of the shortbread texture so be cautious. The chocolate dip using shortening was perfect and melted nicely in the microwave. Be sure to try this recipe and make sure you have the red and white non pareils to top it off. It's a winner!",
