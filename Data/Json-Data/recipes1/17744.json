You can increase the cocoa powder to 1/3 or even 1/2 cup if darker chocolate taste is desired.",

When I tried forming the \"dough\" I found it was extremely dry. The fruit and nuts were just covered in cocoa dust and not blended. I added 1/4 cup of water and re-mixed to make it come together although this did make the dough quite sticky. When I tried them they did not taste very good to me. Admittedly I usually do not make raw vegan desserts but I figured since I liked all the ingredients I would like the final result. I really did not. I think I would have been better off eating the fruit and nuts separately instead of making these. Sorry this is just not the right recipe for me.",

If your brownies are dry use prunes dates or baking raisins. I modified the recipe to: 1/2 cups raisins 1/2 cup prunes and 1/2 cup craisins (I like thicker brownies) I up'd the cocoa and use 1 rounded cup of almonds. The result is super moist brownies. The craisins and cocoa go so well together! This is a wonderful natural recipe thank you!!!!",
