I know this isn't true to the original recipe, but I trusted others and I think it helped.  Great slow-cooker recipe.  I froze the leftovers (egg noodles and all) in my Seal-a-Meal and then just boiled the bag to reheat.  It was great the second time around!",

I have taken all the suggestions and advice from all the reviews and created this:\n \nINGREDIENTS\n2 pound cubed beef stew meat or chuck roast \n2 (10.75 ounce) can condensed golden mushroom soup \n3/4 cup chopped onion \n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce \n1/4 cup water (more if needed) \n1/4 cup low sodium beef stock (more if needed) \n1/3 cup sour cream \n2 ounces cream cheese (reduced fat works well) \n1/2 pack French onion soup mix \nSalt and pepper, to taste \n3 cloves garlic, minced \n8oz. mushrooms, sliced \nPat of butter \n\nDIRECTIONS\n1. In slow cooker, combine meat, mushroom soup, chopped onions, minced garlic, Worcestershire, dry soup mix, pepper, stock and water.\n2. Cook on low setting for 5-6 hours.\n3. During cooking time, saut\u00e9 the mushrooms in butter about 4 mins. \n4. Put saut\u00e9ed mushrooms in slow cooker last 30 minutes of cooking time\n5. Check sauce if it needs salt or extra pepper.\n6. Best served over buttered egg noodles.\n\nI think this came out fantastic.  But again, its all about personal opinions and tastes.  Let me know how this works out for everyone!\n \n\n\n\n\n ",

Add 1/2 t. pepper for a tiny little (but necessary) kick.\r\n4. Just before adding the sour cream, mix 1 T. corn starch with 2 T. cold water, then add this mixture to stroganoff. This gives it the necessary extra thickness.\r\nThen, enjoy this FABULOUSLY delicious and simple to make dish!",

It is super concentrated with absolutely no sauce.  The meat was all shredded up from cooking so long, and the flavor was FAR too salty.  Don't make this recipe.  If you've tried it with all the million alterations people have insisted you need to do in order for it to be good, then go ahead and submit that recipe to Allrecipes.com  I'll try it -- and maybe it will deserve the nearly 5 stars this recipe has.",

This was a great comfort food dinner, perfect after a very long day, so easy to make.  And I have never made homemade stroganoff before!  I made some changes, based on Jillybean14's review, who summed up the 500+ reviews on here (thank you!).  To do what Jillybean did, and save others some time, here is what all these reviews say to do: 1)Add some salt,pepper, and garlic to the pot. 2) Double the meat. 3) Double the soup and water but keep worchestshire and cream cheese the same. 4)Add 1/2 packet onion soup mix to mixture. 5)Cook on LOW only for 5 hours. 6) Add a dollop of sour cream also when adding cream cheese. 7) Add sauteed fresh mushrooms (about 4-6 oz) 1/2 hr before serving.  8) Serve over egg noodles.  I followed these suggestions, and now my husband, who is a big fan of Hamburger Helper, wants this instead and thinks I am the stroganoff goddess. =) A keeper for the recipe box!

To help the cream cheese melt easier cube and soften it before adding.

Added 1/2 tsp of fresh minced garlic,  1/2 packet of dry Italian-style salad dressing and 1/2 packet of Lipton's dry onion/ beefy/ mushroom soup mix to give the stroganoff extra flavor complexity.  Subbed low sodium beef broth for the water, and low sodium worcestershire for the regular.  Added sauteed mushrooms 1/2 hour prior to the finish and stirred in sour cream to taste prior to serving!  Helpful hint:  Check the intensity of your crockpot as some are \"hotter\" than others and you may not need to cook the stroganoff the full 8 hours as the recipe lists.

I liked the flavor enough to give this another try - this time no mushrooms and with a full soup can of water. I also think I'll use traditional sour cream instead - the cream cheese tasted very good but I think the texture of the sour cream will suit my tastes better.
