I put little balls of dough in each muffin cup and then use a wooden Pampered Chef tart shaper to form the tart shell.  I also add 1 tbsp. of corn syrup to the filling to keep the sugar from crystallizing when tarts are baked.  Have been making these to rave reviews for years.",

Since I didn't have the tool, I used an empty 35mm film container to press a small ball of dough into the muffin cup. As you push, it forces the dough up the sides of the cup and you just have to finish it a little in the sides with your fingers. It is so much more simple this way.  If your cups flare more, experiment with other small bottles/containers...(cover the item with plastic wrap, in case the item isn't food-safe).  Pressing all those cups with your fingers is WAY too tedious for me!  I hope this helps because these cookies are too good to skip due to all the work.",

These were very easy. The recipe made exactly 24 and I had to go back and make another batch as we ate too many. Definitely a keeper.",

(btw it was too time consuming for me to mold the liners on the side so i just place all the crust on the bottom.) --- UPDATE --- i've made this about 10 times now. i've tried other recipes but nothing beats this recipe's simplicity. i've also tried different fillings - raisins walnuts walnuts with choco chips cereals - and they're all really good. although i don't suggest walnuts alone because you can really taste the bitterness at least i can.",
