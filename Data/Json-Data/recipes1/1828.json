                "reviewBody": "For those of you who found these buns to dense, the key factor I've found in how fluffy they are is the inital mixing before you add the rest of the flour.\nWhen I mixed these by hand i never did the full three minutes, since the mixture looked smooth well before that. They came out kinda dense this way, but still tasty. When I was able to use a mixer I mixed longer and faster, and I was surprised how fluffy that made the buns. I learned later why this happens. True yeast does do most of the rising and forming air bubbles. However with out proper mixing there will be air bubbles in the bread and they will be uneven in size. What the mixing does is with grainy things like salt kinda punches holes in the dough even in the soupy state before adding all the flour, these holes in the dough will remain and be filled by the CO2 made by the yeast during baking, thus fluffy buns",

They prefer hamburger buns from this recipe to any others I have tried, including store bought...these don't fall apart.  These buns make great sandwiches, too.  I usually quadruple the recipe for my large family because the kids love to snack on them and we like to give them away. I have been making breads and rolls \"from scratch' for decades and this is a great, fast, easy, recipe.  It is by far the best hamburger bun recipe I have used, but we also love them as dinner rolls.  It IS basic so you can adapt the ingredients to your liking... read the reviews and see what others have done.  I have shared this recipe with lots of friends and family.  Everyone who has tasted them loves them.  My one DIL made these as her first venture into yeast bread making and had great success.  Another friend made them as her first venture into yeast breads and her MIL was \"very impressed.\"  It is pretty much a \"no fail\" recipe.  You will be glad you tried them.  I have already passed this recipe on to my children.  Both of my daughters have people requesting them.\n\nI have also made these with fresh ground whole-wheat flour. They were still excellent! :)",
