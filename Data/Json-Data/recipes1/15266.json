However, they turned out great and it didn't take long either!  Thanks to those who said it took 3 bags of microwave corn and to use plastic baggies on your hands-that really helped.  Next time, I have to keep the kernels out!  Also, I think I will use a brown paper grocery bag to mix the popcorn because I had to coat the corn in shifts because I didn't have a large enough bowl!  Excellent recipe-thanks!",

As some suggested, I used microwave popcorn, but I only needed 2 bags (it's probably just a personal preference of how \"carmel-y\" you want your popcorn balls, I like em' sweet). I used Orville Redenbacher's \"Smart Pop\" (to save the calories - he he). Seriously GREAT recipe! PS - I also used one of the recipes for Sweetened Condensed Milk found on this site and it worked better than the real stuff! (cheaper too!!)",

I didn't have a candy thermometer on hand so I just guessed when the caramel was done. Maybe I just got lucky but it was perfect- made chewy popcorn balls just the way we like them. The caramel in this recipe is so good! I wanted to eat the whole pot without adding popcorn! We popped 1 cup of kernals and it made the perfect amount of popcorn for the caramel mixture. Baggies on hands was also a great idea for forming the balls. These are very sweet- you'll only need one!",
