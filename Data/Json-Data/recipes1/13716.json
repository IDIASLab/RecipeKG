And for the coriander/cilantro I have so far substitued dried dill (I daresay better than the original...but i love dill in all things) and fresh parsely (but then it becomes very much like tabouleh).However, the dressing is NOT enough and I always at least double everything in the dressing mixture except for the olive oil.",

I didn't add black beans, but instead went with some diced English cucumber, kalamata olives, bits of crumbled feta, marinated red peppers and Italian flat-leaf parsley. I thought three green onions were more than enough. Next time I think I'll add some grilled chicken strips and call it a meal. This is a great recipe!",

I did double the dressing and I doubled the cumin in the dressing along with adding a dash of balsamic vinegar to cut a small oil taste.  I stirred all of the dry ingredients together, made the dressing in a separate bowl and added it at the end to make sure it was okay to use all of it.  It was!  This is a great recipe, so colorful and wonderfully tasty.  My husband has to increase his fiber so I have been looking at different things to add to our diet that are healthy and high in fiber.  He liked this so much he took it to work for breakfast instead of his standard bagel.  I will keep this in the fridge on a regular basis.  I can hardly wait to grill chicken breast marinated in Italian dressing to have on the side.  A complete meal and easy, easy.  Thanks so much for my new favorite recipe!",
