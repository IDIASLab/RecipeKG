Basically to make it more like the one at your favorite restaurant is to really muddle (with a back of a spoon or better a wooden muddler) at least 10 sprigs of mint per drink as well as 3 wedges of lime 3 tbl. of simple sugar (a 2-1 mixture of sugar and water boiled and cooled-- it's easy and worth it!) Muddle well then add crushed ice to top fill with white rum (about 3 0z) but leave room to add a splash of soda water. Shake or stir and serve! Please do Not use sprite it will not be the same. But using regular sugar is fine just cut the amount in half.",

Personally I use 6 mint leaves to muddle. I think it's the minty flavor that makes this drink so unique and refreshing. If you're getting a bitter flavor you're mashing the rind of the lime too much. You want to release the juices but not the oil from the rind. That's where the bitterness comes from. This recipe has the perfect amount of lime if you're juicing it right:)",

You really have to put some muscle behind it because you're trying to extract as many of the natural oils from the lime as possible. I have never had good luck with sugar in these. A simple syrup (1 part sugar 2 parts water) is the best way to go. Your final drink should be composed of 1/3 rum 1/3 simple syrup and 1/3 club soda. Using a smaller glass is the key.",
