Threw it all in the pressure cooker with a package of frozen carrots. Pressure cooked on high for 45 minutes. Thickened up more than expected, but the water added after cooking brought it back to a good consistency. It was delicious.",

I read all the reviews since there weren't that many. I agree that it needs more liquid so I started w/6 C. water.  Ended up adding 2 more cups over the cooking time so I would say this stew/soup needs 8 C. water.  I used Better Than Bouillon Veggie Base and I probably went a little overboard on that but it was still good.  I'm not a vegetarian so I might try chicken or beef broth next time. Might back off a little on the cumin and experiment with other spices. To the reviewers who say their lentils were still crunchy...did you cook it on high?  Mine came out perfect & by the way mine looked exactly like the picture ??  Very hearty soup and will def make it again!",
