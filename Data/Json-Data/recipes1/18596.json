I've never been particularly fond of the tartness of cranberries so I used an equal amount of pears instead of just one and anise and the spice blend were a little out of hand for me so I just substituted other spice blends (nutmeg allspice) to taste. It turned out a dark dark red but so sweet and delicious. We ate in on toast for months and it kept fine.",

I can see where some people are suggesting cutting down on the amount of sugar - it is sweet but I rather like it that way since it has the additional ginger and spice flavor. I love the combination of pears and cranberries. I had to sub fresh ginger for candied and since I forgot to pick up star anise I subbed about a 1/4 tsp. of Chinese 5-Spice powder which is heavy on the anise flavor. Worked out great! Use a decent garam masala - some of those bottled grocery store ones are awful. The Easy Garam Masala recipe from this site is good in a pinch.",
