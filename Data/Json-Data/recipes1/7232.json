Some people are rating this recipe based upon what they cooked which did not match up well with the actual recipe.  One person complains of mushy vegetables and vegetables are not even in the recipe.  And those who complain it is too spicy - duh - look at the ingredients!  I looked at this recipe and instantly knew I would not make it based upon the peppery/spicy ingredients.  I certainly would not have made it and then given it a low rating for being too peppery.  This recipe did, however, give me a good idea about how to go about cooking what I had in mind.  The only similarity between what I cooked and this recipe was I used a rump roast and I used a slow cooker.  I used my own seasonings (garlic inserted into meat and a rub of garlic pepper, celery salt and tarragon) used 1 cup beef broth and 1/2 cup red wine and just popped it in the slow cooker for 7 hours with chunks of onion.  It turned out very very tender, moist and tasty.  Anyone complaining about tough, dry meat either has a problem with their slow cooker not being on a low enough temperature or a problem with the cut of meat they are using.  I had no problems with fatty juice at all - did strain it through cheesecloth before serving.  Thanks for the recipe - it gave me an idea of what to do even though I didn't follow it this time.  I will possibly use the recipe as written if making meat for chili, enchiladas, burritos or tacos!",

Didn't use cayenne and used 1 1/2 cups water mixed with Lipton onion soup mix.  After about 6 hours on low, I slice it (or shred) and put back in the au jus for another hour.  I serve it on toasted hamburger buns from the bakery and then drizzle some au jus (just a bit) on the top half of bun.  Add provolone cheese and broil for a minute.  Serve au jus on the side for dipping!!  It is ALWAYS a hit!  My picky kids can't get enough!!!**UPDATE* I tried it with the Cayenne and it gave it a nice kick, not too hot!  I plan on adding it from now on.",

I omitted the 2 teaspoons chili powder, but, to compensate, I changed the 1/2 cup water to 1/2 cup beef bouillion.  I also added 3 medium chopped potatoes and 3 large chopped carrots.

I slow cooked this on low for 8 hours and the meat was so tender it just fell apart. I drained the broth and added more salt and pepper to bring out the flavor of the beef. Then I placed the beef on a hoagie roll sprinkled it with grated swiss cheese melted the cheese in the microwave for 40 seconds and we dipped the sandwhiches in the au jus to make a delicious French Dip Sandwhich.
