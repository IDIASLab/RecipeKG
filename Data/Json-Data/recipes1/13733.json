As a suggestion you can add carrots and quarter large potatoes 30 minutes to the pot before the ribs are done. Also what a crime to let all that great beef broth go to waste. After ribs are broiled you can add the big old left over bones back to the pot and simmer for a while then strain for some absolutly awesome broth.",

I used boneless short ribs. My husband loved them, too. Will make again, and I am picky!",
