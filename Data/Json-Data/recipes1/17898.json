I bought 2 packages (4 ribs total) and used the measurements in this recipe.  The lamb had really good flavors.  Only little change I made was to cut back on the cinnamon to 1/4-1/2tsp -would have been overpowering, in my opinion, if there was more than that.  I also added extra honey in the sauce and instead of broiling it in the oven, I finished it over a grill for some nice char.  This cut of meat is very fatty, but delicious nonetheless.",

I used small bowls for steps 2 and 3 and I rubbed the olive oil into the meat then rubbed in the rest of the step-3 spices rather then mixing the spices with the oil before rubbing them in. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The inside meat was extremely tender and delicious and the spices were perfect. Unfortunately the \"crispy\" edge meat was dried-out and hard because it was over-done. Next time I will reduce the temperature from 450 to 425 for the 20 minute 2nd roasting and if it still looks too well done on the outside I will omit the final 4 minutes under the broiler. My side dishes were green beans and fennel and oven-roasted red-skinned potato wedges. I drizzled the parsley and vinegar sauce over the veges and potatoes as well as the lamb. Delicious!",
