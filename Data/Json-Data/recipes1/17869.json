I used 8oz. of Chef John's chocolate chili cookies - took from freezer & let them dry out for a couple hours after crumbling up. They tasted fantastic!  The raisins & chocolate chips really added to the flavor, and I'm craving them ever since. I'm making more now (same way) but will use brownies next time - which I will bake & dry out especially for these. (I bet any cookie or cake would work). I hope I'm not making the Chef mad - I swear I'll actually follow the recipe soon!! LOVE Chef John, his videos & recipes!!  Thank you SO much!",

Altered recipe to 10 oz of prepared 3 day old bownies and just a smidge less than 1/4 cup rum. Worked like a charm. Also added some orange extract to the chocolate coating to add some flare. They were gone before I coud get them on the serving plate. Very easy to make with the adjustments. Thanks Chef John!",

I agree that 4 ounces wasn't quite enough to coat them although that could be me as I made a right mess of the coating. The key with it is to make them about 3-4 days ahead of time so the rum has a chance to mellow out a little in taste. The amount of rum in it seems more of an approximation how much you use depends on how stale your brownies are that may be why another reviewer had quite liquid ones it should be a soft paste but not liquid at all. Mine weren't very stale so I crumbled them up and left them uncovered in the fridge overnight which did the trick.",
