First of all using 2 cups brown sugar and 2 cups white gives a more complex sweetness. Also I add 1/2 cup cocoa powder for a chocolate finish. Also you get a better coffee flavor when using espresso instead of coffee granules. And lastly I split the alcohol into 2 cups vodka and 2 cups brandy. Brandy complements the flavors better than straight vodka. Delish!!!",

I even put about 1/2 cup in chili con carne.  My recipe only uses 2 cups boiling water and a pint of brandy or vodka.  Instead of the vanilla extract I use a vanilla bean cut in half and added to two clean bottles.  It then sits for 60 days.  This recipe is quicker to the finished product, but I still prefer the \"fermenting\" process.  The recipe was given to me by an Army nurse at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in 1966.",

I cut the recipe in half and just used the cheapest vodka I could find. This still made enough to fill an empty wine bottle and then some! It is very tasty but I am going to let it sit for a month and see how good it is then. I really like that this doesn't call for a vanilla bean b/c I was going to use one until I found out how much they cost. OUCH! Just make sure and use real vanilla extract not imitation.",
