Don't soften the butter! Keep it super cold -- if you have time stick the flour mixture in the fridge (or freezer) before or after you cut the butter and always use ice water. When you gather the dough knead lightly to make layers but don't overwork and refrigerate immediately while you work on the filling. Don't overbake. The bottoms should be just starting to turn golden. If the tarts have opened up while baking you have about 30 seconds after they come out of the oven to curl the edges back over the filling before they cool.",
