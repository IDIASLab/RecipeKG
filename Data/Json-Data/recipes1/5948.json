I seasoned the fish with garlic powder and rosemary, quickly sauteed it in a little butter, dumped in a little soy sauce and a can of drained canned tomatoes and let simmer until the fish was flaky. The sauce was great on rice. It looked pretty and tasted \"fancy\". Family all enjoyed it, even the pickiest eater. Thanks for an easy to adapt recipe with great flavor.",
