As written the recipe delivers a simple and traditional style Italian soup meaning that it doesn't contain a lot of spices instead allowing the flavour of the ingredients to shine through. The flavours of the tomatoes onion and celery are evident and \"gustoso\". Adding a few more veggies added some flair. Thank you Rachel for your recipe.",
