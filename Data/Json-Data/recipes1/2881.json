I modified the recipe to make it a little healthier by using blackstrap molasses and 1/2 whole wheat flour which I think also gives it a nicer texture. The dough IS sticky though and I think it works our much better if you chill it roll it into balls roll them in white sugar then cook. They sold well at a recent work bake sale and I got requests for the recipe.",

I did roll them in to balls then lightly flattened them on the cookie sheet for a more uniformed look. Amazing..thanks!",
