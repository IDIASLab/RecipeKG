Actually the recipe for daal is much simpler and we don't need to use a food processor.\nHere is the real recipe:\nDHAL SOUP (Soup from a dhal! )\nIngredients\n1 cup dahl 1 tsp. curry powder\n2 cloves garlic 2 small chilies (optional)\n1 small onion 2-3 curry leaves\n1 tsp. curry powder 1 tsp. sarso\n1 tsp. jeeri ghee or oil\n\nSoak the dhal in water overnight. Heat approximately 2 tbsp. of ghee or oil in a pot.\nAdd sarso and jeeri until they pop, then add onion and curry leaves. Fry until soft. Pound garlic and chili leaves together, add. Once the onion mixture is soft and light brown, add curry powder. Add the dhal. Boil the dhal in four cups water until soft (l hour, when most of the water is gone).  Add salt to taste and voila.\n\nHope this helps.\n",

The only problem I had was the amt. of salt-I used half the suggested amt and it was too much for us. I find that if you are using bouillion cubes you can probably pass on the salt since bouillion cubes are very salty. Anyway I thought this dish was ruined with the saltiness. I knew I could try and add some raw sliced potatoes and cook them for 15 min. to absorb some of the salt but I wanted to see if there was something quicker. I went on the web to see how to fix this. Someone suggested adding lemon juice a bit at a time (you don't want the soup to taste like lemon now!). Sure enough it worked - never tasted the lemon and it corrected the saltiness. In this instance if you had tasted some lemon in this soup it would have worked. Hope this tip helps my fellow chefs out there!",
