I added in the squid and it was maybe 8 minutes for it to be done (about as long as it took for the calamari to take on the color of the sauce and to plump up). The only other changes I made were to add a can of diced tomatoes and I used Burgandy. This was a really nice meal but I would never ever simmer any kind of seafood for 30 minutes.",

DO NOT USE FRESH SQUID LIKE I DID. It is too tender and turns mushy when cooked not rubbery like frozen does. The sauce was tasty and I will make again but will add ground meat (or better yet razor clams). If anyone cares here is how you clean squid. First you pull all the heads off then you cut off the tentacles off above the eyes. Discard the lower portion of the head. Turn the tentacles inside out and cut off the round bulb center. Rinse and Drain. For the body of the squid pull out all the back bones. Remove the black skin surface. Cut squid into round pieces. Turn each piece inside out and remove any yuck stuff on the inside under running water drain. Now instead of putting them in this recipe dredge in a mixture of rice flour and pepper deep fry in hot oil just seconds (till they float less than a minute). Drain on paper towel. Make a mixture of low call mayo and sliced peperoncini and dip the squid in till your hearts content. (or a good cocktail sauce)",

Key as stated in the instructions is to cook very slow and low heat. I taste-tested the calamari and they were done before the time stated but they were thinner slices. Added some fresh chopped parsley for garnish.",

Didn't add the olive oil didn't feel it needed it. And used pomodora tomato sauce. I think thats all.
