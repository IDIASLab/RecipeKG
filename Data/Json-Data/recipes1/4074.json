I'm sure without the additions it's still good, but I recommend adding your own personal touch.",

I use more olive oil, though. You don't really need to simmer anchovies, just heat them through. Don't let them fall apart completely, you want some fillet pieces in there. This recipe relies on quality ingredients, so get the GOOD anchovies and oil. ALWAYS Use fresh parsley. I add it when I toss the pasta with the sauce, I don't cook it. I also add a lot of fresh black pepper. There's also no need for parmesan, it would just make this too salty.",

It gives it great flavor. When we do the anchovies they are chopped up very small and then they boil down in the oil so that those who are not fond of looking at the anchovies don't see them.  Very good recipe..and the longer it simmers the better it is!!!!",

I added four cloves of minced garlic as well as some mushrooms for some extra punch. Although this strays far from the original recipe, I steamed up some spinach and mushrooms and mixed it in as well to add some vitamins and minerals. Served with some garlic bread, this was delicious! If you don't have canned anchovies on hand, you can substitute anchovy paste (1/2 teaspoon per anchovy fillet) -- I used two tablespoonsful and it turned out very nicely.",

The only modification I made to the recipe is as follows: - I substituted 3 (2.0 oz.) cans of Anchovy Filets for 1 (2.0 oz.) can Anchovy Filets chopped. The reason for the substitution: My husband is Italian and the recipe matches the same method utilized by his Mother (from Italy) with the exception of the quantity of anchovies. In her preperation she uses one can of anchovy filets in olive oil and it has always produced a mild fish flavor as opposed to the overpowering anchovy flavor by using three. Top with freshly grated Italian cheese (of your choice) and enjoy! =)",
