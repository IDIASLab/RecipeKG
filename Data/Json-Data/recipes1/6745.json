A box is 14.5 oz. I added 4 full crackers from another package. These are very rich and a 13 x 9 pan makes for a thick rich and sweet treat. The next time I'm going to use a bigger pan and have them not so thick. Be sure to grease your pan well and press the mixture in the pan so that it will meld together. I waited the 4 hours to cut them the chocolate cut nice when it was cold and the sweetened condensed milk soften the hardness of the chips. Thanks mom2frankandy for sharing your recipe. I made these for a Girls Night Out and they were very well received. It will be made again.",
