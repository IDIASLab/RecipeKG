Watch your oil temp, my first batch cooked and browned a little to fast. After that the rest came out golden brown with a great crunch, very good, I made my own cocktail sauce also.

For best frying results I would recommend using a cast iron skillet or dutch oven if you have one, otherwise just a heavy pan. Peanut oil also works best or just vegetable oil. Use a candy thermometer to see that oil reaches 350 degrees and fry shrimp in small batches (4 or 5 at a time) for 2-3 minutes on each side or until golden brown.",
