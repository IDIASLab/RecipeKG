It was hard to tell when they were done since the caramel-ish liquid hardens once its cool and at one point the marshmallows puffed up. My kids (6 4 2) helped to make these for christmas giving...very child friendly but they didnt like eating them (thats ok). I guess they are like a traditional magic bar without being chewy. Let them cool just for about 5-10 min before prying out of the pan (I broke mine into \"bark\") they can get VERY stuck if you let it sit too long. Definitely go non-stick pan here...",

I modified the recipe a bit--used an 8x8 pan to make little bar cookies and just crushed up some of the graham crackers and put them on top. To help with getting them out of the pan I sprayed the pan then put tin foil on hte pan and then sprayed the tinfoil. The parts where the graham cracker was on the bottom were a bit difficult to cut but relatively easy to get out. Where the graham cracker was absent very difficult to get out. I also had to cool them in the fridge prior to pulling out; when hot they were just too gooey. I used large marshmallows and put them in the food processor to cut them; this only worked well because they were stale. I can't imagine it working with fresh marshmallows. Thanks for the recipe!",
