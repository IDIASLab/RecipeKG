I used less chicken and used the breast of a rotisserie chicken just because that's what I had left over. This was pretty convenient, since using the already-cooked chicken cut the preparation time in half. I liked this dish with less chicken, and when I make it next time, I will add more broccoli, as I didn't think it had enough. The cook time for the broccoli was perfect - it was still nice and bright green with just a slight crunch to it. I personally thought this was fine with the cream of mushroom (I hate mushrooms, but I hardly noticed the tiny little pieces in there), but I think this dish could be done with just about any type of cream soup.",
