My husband, two children and I loved this recipe.\nI washed the chicken and then I pan seared it with extra virgin olive oil and Promise butter and then I poked both sides of the chicken with the fork while they were cooking. I then took a fairly large lemon and coated the bottom of my pan and then I added the lemon pepper, garlic powder and onion powder on each side of the chicken breast. Before I put them into the oven I added a dab of butter to each chicken breast and then squeezed the remainder of the lemon onto the breast. I then baked them in the oven @ 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes. You will not be disappointed. A family favorite",

I never measured any of the ingredients I just sprinkled both sides of the chicken breasts with the spices and then browned them on both sides in a large skillet with some white wine lemon juice and butter. Then I baked them in the oven to finish them for about 20 minutes at 375. The white wine really made the chicken juicy and tender and the lemon juice and butter helped give it a creamy sauce to pour over the chicken when serving.",

Creates a great fresh aroma. The last ten minutes added minute rice (soaked in water in a cup to make soft so it cookes througly) into the dish and covered with tin foil. Fantastic creamy lemon pepper garlic herb onion chicken and rice.",

The flavors of the lemon pepper garlic and onion all meld together nicely for this chicken. Only thing I can add on the review is that it seems to take longer to bake in the oven but that could be just my oven too.",
