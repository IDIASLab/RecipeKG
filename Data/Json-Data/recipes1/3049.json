I have, however, made one change.  I use one teaspoon baking soda instead of two.  I thought the soda taste was too obvious, and when I halved the amount they turned out perfect.  I also found that if I just slightly softened the margarine instead of fully melting it I was able to skip the chill time.",

I creamed the sugar in softened, NOT melted, unsalted butter. The dough mixed nicely with the 2 cups of flour. I chilled the dough for a couple of hours, which worked out well. My baking time was about 10 minutes in a gas oven @ 375 F. They cracked beautifully, and the taste was chewy and soft with a slightly crisp top, due to the sugar. I love them and will bring then to my holiday parties. I'm keeping this recipe for future use.",

I also used brown sugar and butter instead of margerine and a splash of vanilla (you just can't bake without vanilla).  I cooked them for two different times.  They're prettier when you cook them till 7 minutes because of they crackle but 6 minutes makes a chewier cookie.  Next time I'll double the spices.  Thanks for a good recipe! My one year old thinks it's good too!!  PS Don't listen to the people who say that batter turns out runny, there's obviously something they missed in it.  The dough is lovely.",

I followed the recipe exactly since I'm really not much of a baker. The results aren't in yet for 2006 bu so far I am in the lead with two recipes that I also got from this site.
