My husband was so impressed, and it only took a few minutes to throw together!  Before pouring the mixture on, I sprinkled the chicken with ground pepper, garlic salt and some italian seasoning.  Mine didn't come out too soupy as I added extra chicken so I'd have enough for my husband for lunch the next day and put some in the freezer for another quick meal.  Served over egg noodles with a side of broccoli.  Definitely a keeper!!",
