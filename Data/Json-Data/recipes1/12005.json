I hollowed out the entire watermelon, used an entire bunch of green onions, two bell peppers, 3 limes, 1 bunch of cilantro and 3 fresh jalapenos.  I drained the watermelon and used the juice for watermelon martinis.  P.S.  Everyone probably knows this, but I didn't.  Use gloves when you chop and seed fresh jalapenos.

Only changes I made were to add 1 extra tbsp. of onion(only had red onion), and used fresh garlic (1 large clove for the double recipe) and added salt to taste.  I did only use 2 tbsp. of lime juice but grated the zest of some of the lime rind.  This allowed the lime flavor to come through without the extra liquid.  Just drain it in a colander after dicing and it gets alot of the liquid out.  This was such a refreshing salsa, I ate it plain for a salad.  This would also make a great summer side dish.  Unbelievable blend of flavor and the textures.  The sweetness mixed with the other basic salsa flavors was outstanding.  I loved the crunch of it also.  A wonderful salsa/sidedish that would also make a great conversation piece at a gathering; no one would expect watermelon to be used in something like this.  Just look at the calorie/carb count also!  Another great plus.",
