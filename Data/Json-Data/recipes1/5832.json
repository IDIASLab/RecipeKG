They are very similar and combined the instructions for both recipes.  If you have not made fried chicken before I would recommend you look at the Deep South recipe as it has a lot of really great tips.",

I cannot imagine chili powder being added or boiling your chicken before frying.  If you fry this on your stove top keep the heat at a medium setting or the outside of the chicken will burn before it is done on the inside.  I generally use an electric skillet with the lid on and then remove the lid about 5 mins. before taking it out.  It makes the chicken crispier but helps it to stay juicy.  I do add some salt, pepper, and paprika to my flour.  To really make this taste great fry it in some Crisco or lard in a cast iron skillet.  I like to keep things light however and use the vegetable oil.  I also fry my chicken tenders this way and then dip them in honey mustard sauce.",
