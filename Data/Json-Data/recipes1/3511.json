I melt all of this in a large pan and then add the cereal to the pan to cut on dishes. I also add about half a bag of powdered sugar to a double-lined paper bag. I let the puppy chow sit for about 5 minutes in the fridge before adding it to the bag. Shake vigourously for a few minutes to make sure each piece is completely covered and then just toss the mess.",

Needless to say, I was so pleased to find that All Recipes had a selection of Puppy Chow recipes to choose from. Now it's my turn to host the Band Party and I followed Stephanie's recipe. My daughter said it looks the same but isn't quite sweet enough. After reading the reviews of other Puppy Chow recipes, next time I will add less peanut butter and mix semi-sweet & milk chocolate morsels and more powdered sugar. I liked another reviewers  idea adding M&Ms and pretzel pieces to the mix. Thanks,Stephanie, for sharing.",
