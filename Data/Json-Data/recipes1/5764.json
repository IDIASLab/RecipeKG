It is so simple that I thought \"How could this possible be good?!\" But if the tough chefs at AllRecipes.com let it be posted that it must have merit; and it does! I prepared it mostly as directly with two exceptions. I used roasted red peppers sliced instead of red pepper and I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed. These were personal preferences and really not enough to change the essence of the dish.

I deglazed the pan with a bit of red wine, and seasoned with italian seasoning (no capers).  Hubby really liked it and said he couldn't taste the tuna, but that's OK with me.  This was a very easy and economical meal which I will definately make again.  Thanks!",
