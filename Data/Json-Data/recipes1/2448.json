That way when the cake batter is added to the pans the topping does not push to the sides of the cake pans. Works really well. As for other notes about the cake sticking in the pan after baking I found that you really have to be diligent about getting the cakes out of the pans within that first 5 minutes. In one instance when I waited too long I simply put the cake back into the warm oven for 3 minutes to \"soften\" up the topping. This cake is really terrific and is not one of those that you should worry about counting calories. Just simply enjoy it then go for a long walk afterwards.",

If you butter the cake pans well let them cool for 5-10 minutes flip them and firmly pat the bottom of the pans they will not stick. Also pull the pans up very slowly and evenly. If one side starts to stick just carefully use a knife to loosen it. I recommend making the day before serving because the flavors blend nicely overnight. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I will definately make this again! As for the caramel topping sticking to the bottom of the pan I had lined the bottom of the cake pans with baking paper - the cakes came out quite easily and didn't stick to the bottom at all. I had also greased & floured just to be on the safe side:). Thanks again Eleanor!",

If youwant you can substitute whipped topping for the real stuff have done it both ways and the topping is actually less calories so you may have two peices....Yummmmmy.",
