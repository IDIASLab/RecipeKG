They turned out okay but I really wanted more coconut flavor. Perhaps I'll try them again with chocolate. Making the button part was kind of annoying; you have to press the shape in before baking but then press again after baking. I also didn't bake that long; instead I baked for less time at 350. thanks for the recipe.",
