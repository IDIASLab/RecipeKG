I needed to pipe it so I put it in a bowl to cool (with some cling wrap pressed against the surface since like a pudding it started forming a skin immediately). I got impatient and put it in the pastry bag hot (thank you Ove Glove) and it was good I did that because as it cooled it turned into cement that was impossible to force though my large star tip. I'm not saying that this was horrible but it just wasn't good.",
