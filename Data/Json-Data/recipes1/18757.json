I was only able to get two good 1 inch steaks out of the head of Cauliflower. I mention this only because if you are planning on steaks for presentation, you will need more cauliflower than one head. The two ends were roasted and are equally delicious, but I only have two \"steaks\" out of one head. This is so good,  you might want to make at least two heads of cauliflower anyway......I keep eating the florets right out of the pan! I seasoned this with Garlic Garni (a mixed garlic and pepper seasoning) Again, DELICIOUS! Thanks for a great recipe!",

I used a romanesco green cauliflower which is pointy and spiky instead of round. I was only able to get two 'steaks' about 1 inch each from a 1 kilo cauliflower. I tossed the fallout pieces with the oil mixture and then brushed the remaining mixture on the 'steaks'. I served it with balsamic glaze drizzled over it. The fun shape (they looked like Christmas trees) and the immense flavour even attracted the kids who claim not to like cauliflower. The cooking time turned out perfect for me. Definite keeper method to serve cauliflower. Thanks SPetrocelly",

Also I found it best to cut the cauliflower in half, top to bottom through the core then cut steaks from the center out. Do NOT try to make them thin. Use it as a side  vegetable or under something with gravy as you would potatoes. I adjust seasoning to fit the main course. Blackening seasoning works as does a simple garlic pepper.",
