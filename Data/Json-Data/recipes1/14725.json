Used garlic chile sauce for the black bean sauce.  I also added a half teaspoon cornstarch to help the sauce \"stick\".  I didn't have green onions so just used regular onions & sauteed them with the garlic.  Green would have been better.  Needs more veggies than just that, too.  The sauce was really good, but not nearly as good the next day.  Eat more the first day or make more/fresh sauce the next.  :)  Tried with reduced fat pork & it was a good choice. Notes4Me: Marinate pork. Can sub spicy chile garlic paste for spicy black bean sauce.  Garnish with Chinese parsley - or cilantro.",
