For whatever reason, in the end I decided against that, opting to  make the frosting exactly as the recipe directed.  And what a reward I got for that!  This is rich, smooth, super chocolatey and not too sweet - but certainly sweet enough.  One reviewer said it best when she called this a \"frosting for grown-ups.\"  When some of the reviewers described this as not sweet enough I knew this was just what I was after and would be perfect for the cupcakes I made with \"A-Number-1 Banana Cake,\" also from this site. After mixing it up I refrigerated it and checked it every 15 minutes or so, giving it a stir and repeating until I had a thick enough consistency for piping. The texture alone is a good reason to try this - this is real frosting and a simply excellent recipe. Also - this was just the right amount to frost 24 cupcakes and would also work for a 9x13\" cake. If I were to use this for a layer cake, however, particularly if I planned to pipe any decorations or borders, I would double the recipe - better to have some left over than not enough!",
