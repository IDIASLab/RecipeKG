It sounds so good, yet I knew after reading some of the reviews, it needs some changes. So this is what I did and it came out crunchy:  Oven temp should be set at 275. The nuts should be \"chopped\" using food processor then combine in large mixing bowl with Old Fashioned Oats, they are more nutritious than Quick Cooking oats. Puree bananas along with chopped dates, and 1/4 cup honey together in food processor.  Combine brown sugar and water and cook in microwave for about 3 minutes or until sugar is completely dissolved.  To it add vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Mix this brown sugar syrup into oats & nuts.  Then stir in the pureed banana, date & honey mixture. At this point, I added about 1/2 cup coconut, completely optional. Stir until thoroughly mixed then spread granola onto 2 large cookie sheets (I lay waxed paper on the sheets & spray with Pam for no-stick & no mess). Press granola slightly onto the sheet to clump. Place each sheet on it's own rack in the oven & rotate half way through baking time.  Bake for 1-1/2  to 2 hours  or until golden and crunchy, stirring occasionally. When mixture comes out of the oven, I added dried cranberries, cherries, & apple slices. When granola is completely cooled, store in airtight container.",

I added the sliced almonds and a cup of coconut with the oats and first mixture and toasted/dried them together and it worked well.  I also added 1/4 cup of honey because of the extra ingredients and to get a pinch of honey flavor. A+++++++++ in my book and a definate keeper.  What a way to use old bananas too!!!  Tip don't put too muck on a pan if you want a dryer or toastier taste keep it single layer.",

If you're using the packaged dates, which are harder than fresh dates but more available, I cook them in a saucepan with about a 1/2 cup of water (or more if needed) for a few minutes until they soften.  I add coconut & lots of chopped almonds as a standard.  So good!",

I was looking for a recipe with no oil and this fit that bill. I did not use the dates because I didn't have any so I ended up using 3 bananas. Other than that i stayed true to the recipe. I think the granola got better with time. It's not super sweet. I really don't taste the banana either. I made more today and have added extra vanilla and cinnamon to fit my tastes. This granola is just pure and wonderful. So glad it's the first recipe I tried.",
