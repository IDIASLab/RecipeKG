I almost follow it exactly except I add teaspoon of lemon zest and cut back on the lemon juice. I also sprinkle red pepper flakes onto the finished dish.  I cook mine longer than 45 seconds, probably closer to 2 minutes, and they still have the nice bright color and texture.  I served this with grilled chicken wings and rice.",

So much so that I've begun trying some variations these days. I still love the lemon especially well, but sometimes I also like leaving out the lemon and subbing in one of the following: (1)  cider vinegar & brown or raw sugar with mustard seeds &/or red pepper flakes or sometimes I use stevia), (2) -or- balsamic vinegar & almond slices (also with red pepper flakes and/or raw sugar), or (3) lime juice with garlic powder and chipotle (or cayenne powder - no sugar here, though).  Should also be good with (4) curry spices or (5) white wine vinegar and cajun spices - or (6) OJ and 5 spice OR jamaican jerk OR add in some fennel.....perhaps anise & coriander & garlic..... (7) five spice powder and a touch of soy sauce, though I haven't tried those options yet..... Bunches of yum!!!!!",
