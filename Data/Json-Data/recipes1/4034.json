This has to be some of the easiest (and tastiest) dough to work with for cut-out cookies.  It's easy to roll out and they hold their form during baking.  I increased the amount of white sugar by 1/4 cup and after adding the flour I added 1/4 cup of confectioners' sugar.  I let chill for two hours in the fridge (overnight seemed a bit excessive).  I rolled the dough out onto parchment paper that I lined with a mixture of flour and confectioners' sugar and these baked up beautifully - light, crisp, and buttery with just the right amount of sweetness.",

I've lost my original recipe so I searched on the internet and ended up here. Thank God! Don't know what I'd do without this recipe. My friends and family absolutely love these cookies! They hold their shape and taste really good with icing (I use royal icing) or plain. I even have a habit of eating the dough. hee hee The cream cheese makes them very soft and rich. This is by far the best cookie recipe I've ever used...by the way they are NOT sugar cookies. Perhaps that's why they are called White Velvet Cutouts...so if you're looking for a traditional sugar cookie these are definitely not it. If your dough is sticky (which sometimes mine is...think it has to do with condensation during refrigeration) just use alot of flour when kneading and rolling. Give them a try you will not be disappointed with these cookies!",

I make many different recipes of sugar cookies and this was not one of their favorites (but I suppose it's not to be thought of as a sugar cookie). I also found the dough to be extremely sticky. Yes refrigeration helps but it's still a very sticky dough. I rolled it between 2 sheets of parchment and used flour. After I rolled it between the 2 sheets of parchment I placed that whole layer on a cookie sheet and placed in the freezer for about 15 minutes - this made the cookie cutter's job alot easier especially since the shapes that I was making were somewhat ornate. If you are decorating your cookies with detail then I think this is a good recipe because the cookie does not lose it's shape while baking. You can definitely taste the cream cheese in these cookies. They are delicious but it does not taste like a true sugar cookie if that is what you are looking for.",

Once you taste the dough it's hard to make yourself make the cookies! Two notes: After refrigerating the dough overnight it was actually TOO stiff to be worked with (but working with it for ten minutes and letting it warm up made it just fine). Also don't let the numbers fool you--you have to make awfully small cookies to get 6 dozen out of this recipe. I used a fairly large pumpkin-shaped cutter and only got just over two dozen.

The negatives for us were: 1) too much butter made for a very crunchy/crumbly cookie and a bit greasy 2) not sweet enough - I didn't want a very sweet cookie but I didn't like these without icing 3) just not a whole lot a flavor. they are a lot like cookie bouquet cookies I think - and I'm just not a huge fan so I guess you just have to like the right kind of cookie!",
