I also substituted an Asiago/Romano blend for the mozzarella cheese. Baking time was 20 minutes at 400\u00ba but my pizza was 14 inches and pretty thick. If you're looking for a great veggie pizza look no further this is is. Five stars and highly recommended!",

I also added about 2/3 cup of defrosted and nuked broccoli cuts and a 3 oz. layer of shredded Monterey Jack cheese right on top of the tomato sauce (before adding the veggies). I always wait to add the mozzarella cheese until the veggies are hot. Otherwise the cheese topping is melted and brown before the pizza is heated through. Magnifico!!! Will make this very often when we feel like a meatless meal.",
