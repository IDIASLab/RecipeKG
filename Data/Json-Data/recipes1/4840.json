I used cream of mushroom soup; I added a little more water; I did not use the onion soup mix (seemed that it would be incredibly salty with the onion mix in addition to the soup) and instead used a little dried herbs seasoning mix (basil, garlic, rosemary, thyme, etc) and fresh garlic for more flavor; I added fresh mushrooms; I mixed the water, rice, and soup mix rather than pouring the mixture over the rice; and I used two chicken breasts because that's all I had.  I baked it for an hour, which was probably a little long.  The rice tasted almost like a nice, creamy (easy) risotto.  You could do a lot with this recipe, and I'll keep experimenting with it.  ",
