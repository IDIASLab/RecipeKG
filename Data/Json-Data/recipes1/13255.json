                "reviewBody": "A fun tasty recipe! I used small apples and the pudding batter rose up nearly to the top of them as it baked. I used whipping cream because there was no milk in the fridge- way more fat and calories but it sure did taste amazing! I mixed the nutmeg and some cinnamon into the brown sugar and added a scoop of flax (to make them \"healthy\" after all that cream!) The pudding part is like a bread pudding without the bread cubes- it's sliceable and soft. Don't forget to START THE APPLES BAKING WHILE YOU ARE MAKING THE PUDDING BATTER! I missed that step in the directions and it will make a difference as mine took longer than an hour to bake- I had to cover it with foil to keep the pudding part from getting too browned while the apples softened. I will make this again- especially when we are reading (and re-reading) Little House books!",
