It didn't taste like gluten free which says a lot about this recipe! This is better than Alison's bread which is also a good bread recipe on this site.  When i read the reviews before making the bread I found several people had bad results and \"gave up\" on this recipe.  Don't take their advice, this recipe does have one mistake: the liquid/flour ratio is off.  I had to add about an extra cup of flour/starch, (rice/potato/tapioca) and if i hadn't been watching the bread machine I may have been disappointed like the other reviewers.  The dough was more like a banana bread dough than a bread dough.  I just scooped it out of my bread maker and poured it into a loaf pan and baked for about 40 mins at 350.  It rose beautifully and tasted fantastic! the only other thing i changed was to use tapioca flour instead of soy.  Update:  I have made this recipe several times now (once as muffins with cinnamon sugar in the middle -see picture) Another time I tried adding a lot more flour to get it to a more \"bread dough\" consistency.  This ruined the loaf, it was so dense, it didn\u2019t rise.  Stick with a banana bread consistency and you\u2019ll be happy. ",

                "reviewBody": "This GF family LOVES this bread.  Here's a summary of all the reviews below that I found work best for my KitchenAid bread maker (Costco 2011)...Use the crust color medium and set for 2lb loaf.  Use sweet bread cycle (NOT GF). I use Whole Milk instead of Buttermilk (mostly out of convenience as I have it on hand)...and when I did try the buttermilk, it came out tart.  Definitely add 1/2 tsp baking powder for better texture.  I replaced the soy flour with tapioca flour.  I use brown rice flour instead of white rice flour. Add an additional 1/4 cup of tapioca flour and an additional 1/4 cup of brown rice flour.  Here's the best thing I can send along....If you are like me, making 2 loaves a week, save some time and sanity and measure out enough of the dry ingredients for 6+ loaves.  In other words, place 6 big bowls on your counter and, for example, as you dispense the salt, distribute 1 tsp into each of the 6 bowls.  SUCH a time saver.  Do NOT add the yeast here--do this only when actually making the bread (as directed on the above recipe).  Mix the dry components well, then label a 1 quart glad bag and you're set.  When it's time to make bread, add  wet ingredients to bread machine, then dump mixed, dry components on top, then yeast.  Voila!  Hope this helps!!",

I made this in my bread machine just as a dough and baked it in my oven the first time and it was great.(I changed it to rice milk and honey)..comes out like a batter bread. Then I tried it by mixing it in a bowl and letting it raise for 40 minutes stirred it down and let it rise again for 40 minute..Don't need the bread machine...Then I tried something new I heated the rice milk with 4 chopped cloves of garlic..on the second raise I add chopped onion,sun dried tomatoe,chopped green, red,& yellow pepper and a little jalapeno..oh my!! It was the best Focaccia bread..Next time I'm going to try dill. This bread can be changed in soooo many ways...Thank you so much ",

My fiancee and I have wheat and dairy intolerances so I made this recipe with almond milk instead of buttermilk. And I also used tapioca flour instead of the soy flour (since didnt have soy). The bread does seem more like a batter but still turned out incredible in the bread maker. I didn't have to bake it in the oven like some users suggested. I'm going to try using some herbs and roasted garlic in the next loaf or I'll try some sundried tomatoes and crushed chillies for a new kick on bread. Thanks so much for this recipe.",

Also, I add 1 TBSP. unflavoured gelatin with the xanthan gum which helps give more rise and 'stretch' to the dough.  Xanthan gum can counteract the yeast somewhat, so I find this helps.  I also do not bake it in a bread machine.  I don't own one, so I mix it in my kitchen aid mixer, and then proof it in the oven.  I turn the oven on 170 until hot and then turn it off.  I then put the loaf in the oven to proof for an hour and then turn the oven on to 375 for an hour.  I bake it until it sounds hollow when tapped.  part of the problem with baking gluten free is that the doughs are so delicate.  Proofing in the oven eliminates the need to move the bread and risk it falling in the process.  Hope this helps!",
