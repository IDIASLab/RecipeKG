Only salt and caraway rubbed inside and outside. Never pick the skin until the last 30-40 minutes stage of roasting. It holds the precious juices that will come out for the sauce you keep. You collect the clear fat( very precious stuff for roux and even medicinal purpose) every 30 minutes. After you finally prick the meat you add broth from the neck and giblets. (You can fry the liver on the goose fat for the pate).Goose is not done until the legs move freely when pushed. Rule is the same as with the rotisserie roasting: do not rush to get the color on the skin. It will get golden when it's time comes!",

For the pastry: remove the large visible chunks of fat you'll see inside the raw goose. They are obvious. Put them in a pan with some cold water and heat very slowly until melted. Cool then chill in the fridge. Lift off the fat; freeze it. For ordinary shortcrust pastry use 2oz of fat to 7oz of flour plus salt as usual. Grate the frozen fat into the flour rubbing in in the normal way then binding with very cold water. Rest then use. PS I always add some lemon juice before the cold water. (Goose fat has a very low boiling point so it has to be frozen to make pastry).",

The port and sherry are great flavors with this and adding fresh tarragon makes it even more out of this world. P.S. Way to go.....Saints are 13-0!!!! Laissez les bon temps roulle!!!!!",
