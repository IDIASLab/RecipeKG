I do think the seasonings in the dressing could stand to be doubled. Canned beans are pretty bland once you rinse and drain them. I think the artichokes need doubled as well. They are in the recipe title so you expect them to be dominant but they get shadowed by the beans. I wasn't sure how the radishes would pair with the rest of the ingredients but they work good and also add a nice crunch. This is a really good recipe and one that is perfect for a BBQ.",
