Don't use the colander that some have suggested.  I cut up my cucumbers in a food processer and then place them in a small bowl with 6 layers of paper towels over the bowl, invert the bowl and then the cucumbers drain into the paper towels.  I also do the same thing with the yogurt--trust me it will work so no soupy sauce!  Also, make sure you mix the olive oil well into the yogurt then mix them together with the cucumbers!  If you have a garlic press, you will definitely need it with this recipe and if you don't have one--go buy one!!  ",

Definitely drain your yogurt and cucumbers-- also another trick to keep it less soupy- mix the olive oil with the cucumbers (after draining of course) this will keep the soupy part down because what is the soupy part is the olive oil mixing with the yogurt! I love this recipe though and my family adores it on all sorts of things- baked potato salad chicken with pita chips etc",
