The gravy's sweet.\"  In husband-talk at my house, that means, \"Why did you ruin the gravy with all that sugar?\"  (He tries to be nice about it.)  He liked the beef, but he only took about 2 bites of his rice with the gravy.  (Please note that I did rub the sugar directly onto the roast, along with the other spices, but in cooking, all of the sugar ran into the gravy, which I expected.)  I also found the butter rubbed on the roast to be excessive, and I found myself trying to skim a HUGE layer of fat off of the top of the gravy when the roast was done.  I don't think the butter contributed a whole lot to the recipe.  This is a good starter recipe, though, and I may try it again minus the butter and sugar.  I liked the mix of onion, garlic, and brown gravy powder.  Just a little too sweet and fatty.  Thanks, though!",
