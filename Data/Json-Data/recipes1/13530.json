So I substituted the salt for celery salt but only added two teaspoons (for 12 servings 2.5 tsp was indicated) of this. The ham I used was leftover shank I had in the freezer - no bone I used that for ham and bean soup and I did add a bit more than the recipe states. I also added a little more water than called for because I wanted to simmer it longer. I also had to substitute some of the cheddar cheese for american and mozzerella. All in all very good and simple to do in a pinch. Note: my soup looked more orange and 'cheesy' than in the picture.",
