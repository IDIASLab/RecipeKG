I grilled the breasts on my george foreman grill and I cooked the pasta alone in the soup mix also adding garlic salt pepper basil summer savory and a lot of grated parmesan. I had to add a very small amount of water to the pasta before it was done I then added the chicken(which I had cut into small peices) and a bit of milk to keep it creamy and I cooked the veggies in the microwave and ate them on the side with the chicken and pasta mix.",

First I followed the suggestion of other reveiwers by cutting the chicken into bite sized pieces. Then I sprinkled garlic powder pepper paprika parsley flakes and dried onions over the chicken as I browned it. I also added grape vinegar to the mushroom soup a chicken bouillion cube and more seasoning salted to taste. I made sure the pasta was cooked al dente before adding the chicken back into the skillet. As I was waiting for the pasta I did have to add more grape vinegar and a bit of water to keep it from thickening up too much before I added the chicken. I'll make it again because it's easy but I'll add more pasta and maybe add another can of cream of mushroom soup.",

My first time making this used frozen veggies containing broccoli/cauliflower/carrots because it was all that was in the freezer. Then doctored it up a bit and added some diced tomatoes and a chopped vadalia onion garlic and ground chipotle to give it some heat. Not sure if a skillet would have made much difference I think next time I make it I may use less water a different blend of frozen veggies like peas/green beans/carrots and maybe another can of cream of mushroom or cream of chicken to give it more of the potpie texture I was hoping for. But over all it was very tasty very filling and was even better the next day. Update Gave this another shot in the skilet this time. This time I used a mixed veggie bag containing peas carrots green beans corn and added some chopped onion. Only used 2 chicken breasts (for any bachelors out there 2 breasts will have plenty of left overs... no pun intended) This time I only used 1.5 cups of water and added 1 can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken(10.75 oz each) and added about a 1/4 cup of chicken broth after the pasta was softened. Salt and peppered to taste. Left out the chipotle powder and the tomatoes this time but it still came out pretty tasty. The texture was more like a potpie. This is gonna be one of my easy throw together staples now. Thanks for the foundation your how to directions rock.",

For the veggies i used a California blend of broccoli carrots and cauliflower. When the chicken is done add one can of cream of mushroom soup and one soup can of milk. then add chopped garlic garlic salt pepper 1-2 tablespoon margarine onion powder and pepper. ( i didn't measure i went by tasting it as i was adding seasoning) then drain your veggies and add it to the skillet and let it simmer and stir frequently. After it becomes a creamy consistency add your rotini egg noodles and a few sprinkles of parmesan cheese and your done:). next time i might try also adding some corn to it it is sorta similar to those viola dinners you see in the supermarket but once again needed more flavor it was a easy starter recipe.",
