Perhaps it was the fact that I love the ORIGINAL version of Spaghetti Pie (and there are many variations) or the fact that by adding a pie crust to pasta adds a multitude of fat calories and carbs. I thought I would give it a try in case it would 'add more' to an already great recipe. WRONG! Putting hot noodles in a pie shell wasn't a good idea. It was pointless to add a crust to pasta. Did you just hear the words \"Spaghetti Pie\" and thought it HAD to be in a pie crust? Oh and there is another reviewer who stated that a 'pie shell' is not a 'pie crust' and inferred that a 'pie shell' is just a pie plate... Google 'pie shell' it's the same as a 'pie crust'. AND you don't put the type of pan in the ingredients! I would much rather have my Spaghetti Pie and a piece of garlic bread! And of course a salad:)",
