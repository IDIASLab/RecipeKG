I was a little suspicious of using filet mignon, but realized afterward that it works the best because it can be pounded smoother than regular steak (less fat). I was also amazed at how many strips you can get out of one filet! Remember to wet the skewers before you put them on the grill and make sure to wrap the bites up well so the cream cheese doesn't ooze out. Also, make sure to wrap SMALL bites, otherwise its way too hard to eat. The first time was a little experiment, but once you get this down, you will not be disappointed. Hope all this helps! ",

She must just be a bad cook because I am a novice and I got these right the first time. The trick is to wrap the bacon so that the cream cheese doesnt leak out. Also I made the bites real small so they were easily \"bite size.\" I grilled on low heat made sure to keep the them off of the flame and had no trouble cooking the bacon and the steak to my liking. This was a DELICIOUS recipe one of my favorites on allrecipe.com!!!",

The only thing I change is to marinate with my own mix though you could probably skip the marinade altogether.

It's less messy to assemble if the cream cheese mix is well chilled. I've made on grill & in broiler.",
