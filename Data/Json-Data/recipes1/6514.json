Great taste and an easy recipe to follow. \n\n  And as a hint to others, Hershey's makes a sugar free chocolate chunk made especially for baking. You can find it stores like Walmart in their candy isle not the baking isle. Also there is a grain sweetened chocolate chip out there called Sunrise. It's usually found in your organic health food stores. But it does melt much easier in higher heats.\n\n  Also if you spray the cookies with butter flavored pan spray a couple of mins before cookies are done baking it will help turn the cookie brown.",

They don't really brown much, either, (when my husband came home and saw them on the cookie sheet he didn't think I had baked them yet), so don't look for browning as a sign of doneness.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and popped a couple in the microwave for a few seconds before giving them to my husband, who's diabetic.  He LOVED 'em, and so did I!  You would never know they were virtually sugar free.  My yield was only about 13 cookies, but I'm sure I must have made them a lot bigger than I was supposed to. lol",

To make the color better, I used 1/2 Splenda & 1/2 Splenda Brown Sugar.  Instead of regular chips, I used mini chips (it looked like more chips).  I used 1/2 vanilla & 1/2 almond extract.
