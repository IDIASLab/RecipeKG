                "reviewBody": "I'm generally a little reluctant to use canned cream-of-whatever soup because of the sodium, fat, preservatives, etc., but for a recipe that's good enough I can be swayed.  This one is good enough.  First of all, the recipe cuts in half quite neatly, and will then fit in an 8x8 dish, which is completely reasonable for two people and provides a satisfying amount of leftovers.  I used pre-cooked chicken and swapped half of the mayo for sour cream (a trick I've done before and liked in other recipes); I also used frozen green beans defrosted in the microwave, and jarred mushrooms.  (Which, by the way, I won't repeat:  the texture is awful.  Next time I'll saute fresh shrooms instead, and will thus avoid having to pick them out of the finished product.)  I used fire-roasted veggie Kashi crackers because they were what I had, but I don't think I'd do that again, either; the taste was too strong.  I thought the curry was perfect.  It's not really enough that the recipe could be called \"curried;\" if you know it's there, you can taste it, but if you don't, it just sort of enhances the chicken flavor.  I think next time I might use corkscrew pasta; the rigatoni was good, but corkscrews would catch all of the sauce.  And, finally, instead of parsley, I used chopped scallions on top.  I served it with a salad with a strawberry vinaigrette dressing; the sweet-tart dressing cut the creaminess of the casserole nicely.  All in all, a great, easy recipe that I'll make again.",

I used one can of cream of mushroom soup & one can of cream of chicken. I added about 1/4 teaspoon more of the curry. I omitted the mushrooms & addes some corn instead. I also added a little more cheese and a little more cornflakes. Oh! And maybe most importantly I used farfelle (bowtie) noodles instead of rigatoni. I also omitted the butter as the oils from the cheese gave the cornflakes plenty of moisture. Overall it was great! Thanks for the recipe Michele!",

I made it and decided to make it for 8 instead of 4 expecting to share with other family members.  Boy, what a mistake!  It was like the casserole that took over Chicago. It was huge! It could easily have fed twice that many people. I have to say, I had to make several substitutions, but I doubt it hurt the recipe (but as my sister-in-law said, you still don't really know what the recipe tastes like, do you?) Ummm, no.  But it was good. The substitutions were strictly for the reason that I didn't have the right ones. I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and 1 of cream of celery, didn't have curry and decided to try creole seasonings (got try something), didn't have green beans or mixed vegetables so used package of chinese vegetables, also, had to use ziti (big deal). I didn't care, it was still good. There was enough for two huge casseroles so I gave my daughter one to put in her freezer for an upcoming pot luck.  I will definitely make again.",
