I also used one pound of turkey kielbasa. I did not add the rice to the pot however as my family prefers their rice separate. I had no problem with it thickening without the rice either and that was with using two cups of fat-free chicken broth. One can of diced tomatoes worked perfectly well as a substitute for the fresh tomatoes as mentioned by another reviewer. It was amazing! I couldn't get enough! Definitely making this again!",

I swapped out the smoked sausage for Andouille and added cayenne pepper and the bottle of tabasco on the table. I thought the preparation was easy and the addition of the Allspice was a very nice touch. Other slight modifications I made were to nix the tomato (my partner doesn't like them) and used a green and red pepper instead of 2 reds. My daughter has already asked me to make it again this weekend!",
