Also, I did not add the tomato sauce or the Italian seasoning until the lentils were thoroughly cooked...oftentimes lentils do not cook completely when a tomato product is used at the start.

I then added 6 cloves garlic with the onion when the onion was half done to avoid burning the garlic, 1 lb Italian sausage, 1 pkg dry Italian dressing seasoning mix, a dash of red wine vinegar, chopped carrots and celery, 4 cups chopped fresh spinach and used my own plain chicken stock I always save in my freezer left over from simmering chicken for other uses.  As suggested I added tomatoe sauce to taste after the lentils were cooked to avoid clowing the cooking time.  I served with some crusty garlic whole grain bread.  Since I increased the amount I planned to freeze leftovers for future meals but the family ate every bite and clammored for more.  Its now a family favorite and I have to make two batches if I want to try to freeze some for nights when I don't have the time to cook, putting it from the freezer to low in the crockpot to have it hot and simmering by dinner.

Instead of the beef broth and onions I used a can of French onion soup and a can of water and instead of the tomato sauce I added a can of \"Soup At Hand\" (microwavable ready-to-eat) classic tomato soup. I also added a teaspoon of fennel seeds to the standard Italian seasonings and some red pepper flakes for a little spiciness. I also chopped up about 1/2 a cup each of celery and carrots and added it into the mix. The result was amazing--a rich thick lentil soup with more flavor than most restaurant soups!",
