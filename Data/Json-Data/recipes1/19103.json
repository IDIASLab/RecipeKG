It does dirty up another pan but I think that is the easier way. The one thing I did not like about this recipe was the bamboo shoots. For starters I felt they were out of place but the biggest problem I had with them was that they hold so much moisture that they sogged up the beautiful riced cauliflower. The cauliflower was perfect and looked really good but then the bamboo shoots turned it mushy. Lose the bamboo shoots and you'll have a 5 star recipe.",
