One helpful hint is to keep the sugar handy to dip your scissors in when they get too sticky. I've tried freezing the gumdrops and using the food processor but that doesn't work very well and was extremely noisy!! This is a very tasty \"fruit\"cake--not what traditionally is thought of as a fruit cake. I hope you decide to try this one and I'm pretty sure that you'll enjoy this piece of our family's Christmas tradition too! Thanks for sharing the recipe Glenda=-)",
