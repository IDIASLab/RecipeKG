I marinated the tempeh first though in some tamari garlic water and olive oil. I strongly suggest marinating since tempeh can be bland. I also didnt have green onion so i minced about 2 TBS yellow onion instead. Also the instructions talk about garlic but no garlic is mentioned in the ingredients so i just guessed. AND i admit i didnt use as much oil! so i dont know if it was because of that or if the batter was too thin but i found that drizzling a little extra batter over each peice is DELICIOUS! It turned out very good and i would definately make it again! We ate ours with ketchup! YUM!",
