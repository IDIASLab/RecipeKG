The flavor was mild and the ribs were extremely tender. Ginger was left off of the ingredient list so I added 2 tsp of freshly grated ginger and I wish I had added more. The vegetables were wonderful too and next time I'll add more carrots. My family devoured this meal and it will be perfect for company. I'll definitely make it again! Bison is very lean and very good. Thanks for such a terrific recipe.",
