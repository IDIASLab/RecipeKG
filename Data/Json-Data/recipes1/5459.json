The sauce you make here is less complex, a little sweeter and fuller than barbecue sauce. Seeing the ingredient list, the lack of traditional barbecue sauce items was obvious from the beginning, si I prepared this the recipe with that in mind. And this baked chicken dish is just outstanding! It was very simple and fast to put together, the thighs stayed wonderfully moist and tender, and the sauce added a lovely yet gentle sweet-tomato flavor to the overall dish. As always, I initially make a recipe as written, and this one was treated that way. When I make it again (and I will make it many more times!), I will make three slight changes. I'll make a couple slits in the skin of each thigh (avoiding cutting into the meat) to allow the rendered fat to drain better, I will place the thighs on a rack in the baking pan so they don't sit in the rendered fat during cooking, and I will turn the pieces each 15 minutes during the cooking, turning them over each time. This will probably provide for a crisper skin as well as better caramelizing of the sauce. We just loved it!",

Another variation I use is pork chops.",

I made DOUBLE the sauce because I wanted to serve it over hot buttered white rice. It was delicious! Definitely in the books for keeps.",

But I did this time due to lack of ingredients (surprising I know with such a short list of ingredients). I didn't have enough corn syrup so I added honey until I had enough. I was also short on ketchup so I added chili sauce until I had enough. WOW!!! I did add a little onion powder and black pepper for some kick but it would've been fine without them I'm sure. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs but we all agree that the sauce would ROCK on anything pork!!! Just be sure to thicken the sauce if you want to spoon any over the meat. My sauce was a tad runny but it may have been my fault. What a great inexpensive recipe!! Keep em coming!!!",
