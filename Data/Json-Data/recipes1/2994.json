You can have basically the same cake minus the jellied bits by buying lemon cake mix doubling the frosting and mixing in a bit of coconut. I make this \"cheaters\" RELee cake and no one ever notices the difference. It's a great adaptation if you're pressed for time (and who isn't!)",

A real show-stopper. Very special. Not at all hard to make although the zesting/juicing of all of those lemons/oranges took a lot of time. Only modification: I thought it was strange that the cake recipe had no oil/fat in it. I thought of how oil makes chiffon cakes so nice and tender and added 1/3 cup canola oil to the batter. Taste and texture of cake was superb. I will make this again for a special occasion. Thank you for sharing!",

I think the prep time listed in an underestimation. I was a little concerned when I separated the layers because the cake did seem dry and bland but once I poured the delicious lemon filling on and let it soak in the cake had a great lemon flavor. Definitely let the cake sit a couple of hrs before serving. The cake does have a dense texture and is not comparable to the texture of a boxed cake mix. This was the main negative for me. The frosting is really sweet but tasty. For me the best part is the filling which has a wonderful lemon flavor.",

I also stirred the lemon curd for a long time bc it didnt thicken and it thickened when i removed it. It was almost impossible to cut the cake into 4 pieces without it crumbling so I put the lemon curd in the middle and the entire cake slid off. I had to put it in the fridge with skewers which dried the cake out even more. The flavor of the frosting was good but I will never make this cake AGAIN.",
