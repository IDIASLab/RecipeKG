I cooked the sliced potatoes seperately only to give them some color and when they were about done, I mixed the chops & taters together, added cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup (two cans each, we have a very large family) and heated it through.  It was GREAT and there were no left-overs for the next day.  Even my picky son ate two servings!!  Don't try this recipe without first seasoning the chops and adding a little seasoning to the potatoes, too; otherwise it will be way too bland.",

Here's what I did: I sprinkled the pork chops with seasoning salt garlic powder and Italian seasoning before browning them with some chopped onion. To the soup I added garlic powder Italian seasoning and chives. Now here is where I probably made the mistake: Per previous comments I wanted to make sure there was enough sauce so I added a small can of evaporated milk. DO NOT ADD EVAPORATED MILK!! My potatoes ended up sticking to the bottom of the pan so bad that I was scraping overcooked/almost-burnt potato chunks out. The potatoes ended up tasting GREAT (even the overcooked scraped-out bits!) but the chops didn't come out so well. My daughter ate some of the chops but both my husband and I were really not thrilled with the chops. They were really dry. Again probably my fault. Next time I'll either use the original recipe (plus seasonings) in the slow cooker or I'll just cook the potatoes in the soup and prepare the chops separately. Thanks for an interesting base recipe! UPDATED 12/14/05 - Made it again without the milk same stuck-to-the-pan end. Must be my pan. It's easy and convenient the taste is fine (once you spice up a regular can of soup)... But the chops weren't great and the baked-on factor means I probably won't make again.",
