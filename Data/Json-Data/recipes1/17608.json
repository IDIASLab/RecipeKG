I made my own fresh squeezed orange juice and I used Cool Whip for the whipped cream. I also used reduced fat cream cheese and light whipped topping. We loved this even my husband! We ate sliced organic apples chunk pineapple Cutie slices and whole strawberries with this. Next time I might add some lime zest to this but that's a personal choice.",
