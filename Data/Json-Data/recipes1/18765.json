It was amazing. \nI modified:\n- elbow macaroni for penne pasta. (Not whole wheat)\n- Philly light cream cheese for Neufch\u00e2tel \n- marble instead of mozzarella \n- Aylmer brand garlic and olive oil finely diced  tomatoes instead of plain diced tomatoes.\n- when I poured in my spaghetti sauce, in order to clean out the Bottle I poured in 3-5oz of leftover white wine, swished it in the bottle and dumped that into the sauce\nFinally, I added 2 tsp of sirracha garlic chili sauce for a tiny kick.\nGo forth and pasta bake, you won't regret it!!!",

One reviewer mentioned adding a little wine to the sauce; that would probably be awesome. I'll make it again, but not just like the recipe.",

I didn't have enough chicken on hand and I wanted more veggies anyway so I added 2 small sliced zucchini and a can of rinsed and drained cannelini beans. Also used thigh instead of boob because that's what I had. Saute'd the chicken with diced onion and deglazed the pan with a splash of white wine added some rosemary and red pepper flakes... All of the changes I made were basically minor/superficial. The bones of the recipe are spot-on. Play around according to your tastes and what you have. The recipe works! Will DEFINITELY make again!
