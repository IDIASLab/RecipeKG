The measurement of each of these three should be 50 grams per egg. So a 5 egg recipe requires 250 grams butter 250 grams sugar and 250 grams flour. I'm sure if you try this the result will turn out better! In August I have submitted the recipe for the BOTERKOEK that some of the reviewers here are talking about. BoterKOEK is completely different from BoterCAKE. Unfortunately this recipe is not public yet.",

In The Netherlands we have both \"boterkoek\" and \"botercake\". Botercake = pound cake. (A dense rectangular yellow pound cake made with butter) Boterkoek = A kind of thick buttery cookie always round in shape. Very dense. Softer than dutch cookies little firmer than American cookies usually are. The word 'koek' can mean 'cake' in Dutch (old fashioned) but nowadays almost always means 'cookie'. The word 'cake' is most commonly used in Dutch for pound cakes (the rectangular kind). Large round frosted cakes like in America are often called \"taart\" in Dutch which means \"pie\". (So used for both round cakes and pies)",

Her original recipe apparently required 250 grams each of butter sugar and flour. If you calculate this is 1.1 cups of each. I just used 1 1/8 cup each of butter sugar and flour and it came out moist and tasty. 2 cups of flour would probably make it pretty dry! Thanks for the recipe Hanneke!",
