Firstly, I found the fruit layer a drop too tart. I usually cut the sugar in recipes, but here even I think it needs more sweetner. In addition, as a I try more and more cobblers I'm finding that there are two basic types - with the dough on top or the dough on bottom. It seems that when the dough is on top (like it is here) you tend to get a compote with cake floating on top, not a real cobbler. I think I'm going to keep looking for more dough on bottom recipes.",
