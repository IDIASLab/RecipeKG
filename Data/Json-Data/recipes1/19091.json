I did make some minor changes due to personal taste and lack of availability of ingredients -- first I used shallots instead of an onion (for their milder flavor) and I also used a mixture of different kinds of mushrooms - both of which worked out fine. Don't bring soup to a hard boil at any time just follow instructions as they are. After making the soup I put it in a crockpot on Warm then on LOW for a party that was several hours away - it kept the soup at a perfect temp and everyone LOVED it! Served it with snipped scallions to top it off and croutons which complimented it very nicely. Will definitely make this again!",
