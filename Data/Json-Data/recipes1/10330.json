I doubled the sugar and added about 1/4th cup more milk.  I also mixed the melted butter in with the topping mixture and sprinkled it all on top and then took a knife and dragged it through the batter (already in the pan) so that some of the topping would sink below.  I really liked how it came out, I'm posting a picture in the photo section, so you can see.  The cake came out nice and crisp on top but very moist below.  It didn't last very long around my house and i'm already wanting to make it again!",

I took the advice of another and added 2/3 cups sugar to the batter and a little extra brown sugar to the topping (about 3 tbls) and WOW was it delicious, so quick, easy YUMMY! Whatsmakes this recipe even better is that it requires so little ingredients and all are common place around my kitchen. I will try to double it next time and see how it works. This is certainly a keeper and the first recipe to motivate me to rate and review. Give it a shot!!!",

I put apples under the crumble topping and made another one and omitted the crumble topping and put about 1/2 cup raspberry jam(about 10 minutes before it came out of oven) and drizzled a little icing on top of both cakes after they were baked. Thanks for the recipe--I will definately be using this one again.",

W/ the changes this deserves 3 stars. I say: keep the recipe the way it is. It was a tad too heavy and sweet w/ changes. I have a sweet tooth and didn't care fot it.

This put me in the mood to nest and give my family something freshed baked sweet and warm. This recipe was perfect! I made a few small changes based on what other reviewers said - increased the white sugar to 1/2 cup used 6 tbsp unsalted butter instead of shortening added 1/2 cup buttermilk to the batter increased vanilla to 1 tsp. To the topping I added chopped pecans 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and increased the cinnamon to 3/4 tsp. I baked at 425 for about 25 minutes. The cake was fluffy moist rich without being greasy and not too sweet but not bland either. Next time I will mix the melted butter into the topping as others have done and perhaps run a knife through the topping to swirl it into the batter a little.",
