It really dosen't matter what kind chocolate you use we've even used Candy Melts and it turned out fantastic! If you'd rather not use sprinkles colored sugar works just as well. You can also use wooden skewers for this recipe too. Just use scissors to cut the tips off of the skewers before you use them. NOTE: These sell really fast at Fundraisers too!",

Make a bouquet of them for a centerpiece or wrap them in cellophane and give as party favors. I melted 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips to get enough for dipping. You'll need to keep microwaving (or work fast) to keep the chocolate thin enough. As with cake balls you're not so much dipping the bunnies in chocolate as spooning chocolate over the bunnies and then giving them a good tap-tap-tap on the side of the bowl to shake off the excess chocolate and help it smooth and settle.",

My kids loved them very much....Will suggestion and/or let others know when deciding to use colored melting chips. Be forewarned that the colored melting chips are thicker and you will have just a tad bit of a problem coating evenly and getting your bunny safely out of the chocolate. Just sayin' I think that was my only problem with the recipe when I deve-ated from using chocolate chips to colored melting chocolates. But otherwise deck those bunnies out.
