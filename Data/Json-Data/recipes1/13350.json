When heating the sugar, butter and milk start on low heat (I use simmer setting) for about 12-15 minutes until sugar is throughly dissolved (put small amount on spoon, raise out of pan, let cool a couple of seconds and rub some between your thumb and forefinger, if you feel sugar it's not dissolved yet, keep stirring), once dissolved then raise heat to med-hi to bring to a boil. If you don't rush it you will not regret it. This is true with any flavor fudge!",

The water that goes into the pan will not harm the syrup being made. This will keep sugar crystals from forming on the sides of the pan.  The crystals will cause the syrup to sugar causing a grainy texture in the final product.   Hope this helps.  GRY",

My insurance policy when making any fudge that is cooked like this is to add 2-3 T. white Karo.  I learned this from Alton Brown on the Food Network on one of his fudge shows.  It doesn't affect the taste of any fudge and the different type of sugar, or glucose, will prevent the other sugar crystals from clumping together which accounts for the graininess.  You can also substitute a 10.5 oz. bag of miniature marshmallows for the marshmallow creme which makes this step a whole lot easier.  This is a variation on the Fantasy Fudge that has been around for years.",
