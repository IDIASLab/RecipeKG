I also scooped it back into the shells to bake but ended up with only enough mixture to fill three out of the four shells generously (forgot there's some empty space where the seeds used to be!) This would make a nice change from mashed potatoes and if using a fat-free or lower fat version I think it would be a healthier alternative...more fiber vitamins etc. I will definitely make this again!",
