This type of scone recipe is quite common in Australia. Serve warm with the topping of your choice. In my family, we love scones with cream and fresh strawberries, but they're great with butter and jam, or anything else you want to try.",

The final scones were large, suitably fluffy and delicious served hot with strawberries and fresh cream. They were not very sweet at all - the sugar in the lemonade was just enough for them to not taste savoury... But that is the way British scones are meant to taste. A lot of the flavour is meant to come from the filling you add, rather than the actual scone being sweet. I will definitely make this recipe again. ",
