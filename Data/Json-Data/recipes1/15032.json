It is super easy and soo good.I was confused with the directions for a minute, the directions should say substitute cake box ingredients with these ingredients but mix it together following the box directions. Makes you pause for a second, but no big deal.   Make sure you poke your holes big enough (I used a straw and felt the holes were too small) and very soon after the cake is out of the oven, don't wait. I added half the pudding pushing most of it down in the holes and left a light layer on top, then I mixed the rest of the pudding up with some whipped cream and topped it with that. (My only alteration and done the seond time, hte first time I made the cake I followed directions to the T, both are good, whipped cream adds more lightness to the cake).    The result was a fantastic light, airy, wonderful lemon cake.   I will try this with a white cake and chocolate pudding, chocolate cake with chocolate pudding, strawberry cake with vanilla pudding, the possiblities are endless and all sound good.",

First off the recipe states the ingredients you need to make the cake but in the instructions it says to prepare and bake the cake as directed on the box. Well the two aren't the same so that can make it confusing. Secondly 2 pkg. pudding is WAY to much. I had to scrap some off the top. Thirdly the recipe says to add the 1/2 the pudding to the cake immediately after taking it out of the oven. Doing so makes the cake slightly mushy. To avoid this slightly cool the cake first. And lastly the cake needs to be refrigerated so you end up with cold cake. This may not be a problem for you but I don't like my cake ice-cold. I won't be making this again.",
