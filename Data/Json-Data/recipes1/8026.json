I didn't know if the term \"mix\" when combining the sugars eggs butter and all was with a mixer or by hand. I used the mixer until it was blended. I hope I didn't overblend it and that's why it was soft. I'll have to do some research on pecan pies before I bake this again. Hubby said he would like more cranberries too.",
