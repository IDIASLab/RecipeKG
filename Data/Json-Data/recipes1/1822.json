The batter was so creamy, I ate alot of it raw(yummmm). I did have to cook it for an extra 15 minutes to get it done. I also toasted my pecans in a pan with butter flavored Pam before I put them in the batter. I sprayed both pans with Butter flavored Pam then sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar(mixed) in the bottom of each pan added the batter then sprinkled the top of each with the cinnamon sugar mixture. Both came out of the pan clean and the top was sooooo good. I got this idea from another review as well. \r\nI looked at every recipe on this site before I decided on this one. I only found two reviews that were negative for this recipe and I have decided the cook must have done something wrong or their oven was not working properly. \r\nI am very pleased and will make this often!",

I made this for the first time tonight with a few substitutions:  half shortening/half applesauce; removed 1 c. of the sugar; added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  It turned out perfectly moist and delicious.  NOW I have to decide IF I'm even going to take one of the loaves to work!  Thanks, Teri Lynn for a classic recipe to add to my recipe box!",

I made one loaf with chopped pecans (I didn't have any walnuts on hand) and the other loaf plain.  I am not sure which loaf we liked best.  I always dread getting the end pieces too, but the entire loaf was wonderful.  Absolutely perfect!!  I wouldn't change a thing!",
