Mixed everything up right in the bag (added one extra clove of garlic for good measure), the meat was 2.38 lbs and the marinade amount was fine. One trick: measure out the oil first, then the mustard, it will just slide out of the measuring spoon from the oil residue! Put on direct heat on grill to brown on all sides, then proceeded to cook it on indirect heat for about one hour (I like to make sure that pork is really done). This is company worthy. Sliced into one inch medallions and served with mashed potatoes, green beans and homemade bread. Pound cake for dessert. Try this, you will not be disappointed!",

I did make a few substitutions as follows: stone ground mustard in place of dijon and light tasting olive oil in place of the sesame oil.  I also baked the tenderloin in a moderate oven and watched the internal temp closely as not to overcook.  With the leftover marinade, I threw it in a saucepan on the stove and reduced it so I could add it back over the meat after slicing.  This recipe is a keeper in my book!",

And I went heavy on the pepper...that does a lot to cut through the excessive sweetness. I also added a little extra garlic &  resrved some of the marinade to pour over the chops while cooking. Instead of grilling, I baked in 375 oven, covered in foil for 40 minutes, uncovered & baked for another 20. These were excellent! I served them w/ Green Beans with Almonds, Autumn Apple Salad II, Pumpkin Rolls II & a glass of white zin.  These dishes paired together so well & tasted so seasonal that hubby said it was the best meal we've had in a long time....and we eat good! LOL Thanks Lesley!!!",

                "reviewBody": "My package of pork tenderloin came with 2 that were each over a pound.  This was plenty of marinade for both.  It was so juicy and tender and the flavor was fantastic.  I marinated the pork in a gallon sized zip loc bag in the frig, turning it now and then so it was really immersed in the marinade.  It was actually better than pork tenderloin we've ordered at restaurants.  My only comment is that if you are going to use the marinade that the pork has been sitting in you should definitely place it in a saucepan and boil it (not heat it at low heat) before basting the pork.  Better yet, make extra and use that to baste while cooking.  Then slice the tenderloin and drizzle some of the remaining sauce over the top.  It's wonderful.",

When I opened the bag that I was marinating in I knew we were in trouble. All I could smell was the sesame oil. So I whipped up some more of the \"sauce\" without the sesame oil. Grilled my chops basting frequently. They looked delicious...the grill caramalized the glaze nicely without burning (thanks to low heat). Looks can be deceiving I guess. They were not good. The sesame was totally overpowering...it was the only thing we could taste. It would probably be great without it...in fact the separate glaze that I made WAS good without the sesame oil. With the oil though it left me with lots of leftovers that I know are not going to get eaten. We like sesame oil too...it just didn't belong here. We have always used it more as a condiment (like a drop in our Oriental Shrimp Noodle bowls). I think we'll keep using it that way and leave it out of our marinades from now on.",
