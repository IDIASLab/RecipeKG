                "reviewBody": "The reviews are all over the place on this one and after making it I see why. First of all I think the eggs should be tempered. Tempering gradually cooks the eggs so they remain liquid and don't become little eggy bits. Gradually add the hot mixture to the egg mixture whisking the egg mixture all the while until the egg mixture has become hot. Then whisk the egg mixture into the hot mixture. Voila! Tempering. I tempered the eggs and I was fine. The eggs will be cooked this way so the pie doesn't need baked. Secondly I think 1 tablespoon of lemon zest is way too much. I should have caught that as an experienced cook but I missed it and think that it made the pie almost too lemony and almost bitter--and I LOVE lemon! 1 teaspoon would have been best. I'm not sure where the comments about the eggs not mixing with the salt sugar and flour are coming from--my mix was still wet; no clumps here. I used 1/2 c less sugar and it was fine but I'm not convinced that made the difference. So if you temper the eggs and use less lemon zest this recipe would be stellar. As is it does have some issues so I think it is more 3 stars right now. Thanks for the recipe!",

I only had a can of cubed pineapple so I crushed myself in a food processor. It was nearly an applesauce texture after that. I tempered the eggs and didn't stop stirring the entire time it was on the heat. I also added a few drops of coconut extract. My filling wasn't clumpy at all. After cooling it was firm no running in the pan etc. Only thing I will do differently next time is make two. Thanks for sharing.",
