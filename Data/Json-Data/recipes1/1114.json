I made my first cake last week and have since made two more this week alone (each of them have been pried from my hands before I could even admire my work) I have nothing but great things to say about this cake!! I don't bake often and this was the first cake I baked from scratch. It was no problem for me. I added the pudding and extra 1/3 cup of oil like some other users suggested and I also use cream cheese frosting instead of the chocolate glaze. I have been demanded to make this cake for a fundraiser coming up. Everyone just LOVES. This cake. now I just have to learn how to decorate it better",

I used my favorite frosting recipe but changed nothing else. Next time and there will be a next time I would consider using mini chocolate chips or just chopping up block chocolate as the chips were a bit chunky and made the cake rise a bit unevenly. Take care not to over bake - I let it cook a few minutes over and next time will have it out a bit earlier. All around a winner. A great recipe to have - Thanks barb for sharing",
