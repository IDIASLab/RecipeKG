The result is so awful and runny there is no possible way to roll the \"dough\" up---it is batter. Oy vey. I suggest adding lots more potato flour and matzoh meal and sugar---then you have a dough. Problem is though once you roll the results up and bake them you end up with a brittle exceeding fragile product. I managed to cut some into bars and sugar them as directed. Probably could have used another egg to bind since I had to add so many dry ingredients to yield anything workable.",
