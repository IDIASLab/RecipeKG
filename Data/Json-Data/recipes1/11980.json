I probably shouldve listened to the reviewers who said NOT to put in the blender but I did put it in the blender anyway--which makes it all runny and wierd although it still tastes good. Added some orange bell pepper and to one of them added salami for the bf. I sliced with a pizza cutter and true to form made a mess of them but I guess since I'm not feeding them to company it doesn't matter. Bf liked them--said they reminded him of buffalo dip.
