Didn't have fresh onion so I sprinkled about of 1 TBS of dry minced onion. Also per husbands trial tasting I added 2 TBS brown sugar (he likes it sweet). Also to thin it a touch without watering the flavor down I added about 1/3 cup ruby red grapefruit juice. I served this on egg noodles will try rice next time. This would make excellent sloppy joes!
