        "description": "These soft, cake-like pumpkin cookies smell wonderful and are a great reminder of autumn. The recipe came from my great-grandmother and yields a small batch, so we sometimes double it. The caramel frosting is glaze-like and quite thin, so it helps to place the cooled cookies on waxed paper while frosting. I usually use an entire can of pumpkin, rather than letting a small portion of it go to waste. Store in an airtight container for very soft cookies, store in a loosely covered container for firmer cookies.",
