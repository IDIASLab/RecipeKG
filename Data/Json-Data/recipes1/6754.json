I also added 2 tblsps of Hoisen sauce, a good drizzel of sesame oil, a tsp of cayenne pepper and a splash of lemon juice. I didn't have green onion on hand so I used some dehydrated onion in the mix (although I missed that green onion flavor). I forgot about it in the fridge, so it marinated for 2 days but was great. I'm not sure why other reviews said their steak was tough - I'm thinking maybe it wasn't sliced correctly? You need to cut \"against\" the grain and with a slight angle or it will be a tough. I feel if you cut flank steak properly it's actually quite tender (even without marinating it for days) I cooked mine on a George Forman indoor grill until it was  medium. You also need to let the grilled meat \"rest\" for 5 minutes or all the juices run out on first slice & the remaining won't be that juicy. Thanks for the marinade recipe that you can adjust to your own taste! I look forward to warmer weather when I can cook this on my outside grill! I sliced this thin and served with Japanese sticky rice. This would also be good sliced thin and used in lettuce wraps with other components as well, just another idea. ",

                "reviewBody": "Not bad - it does make the meat very tender if you marinate it at least overnight and most people will surely not find fault with honey and soy sauce. That being said know that the dominant flavors are going to be very Asian tasting: soy & honey creating what amounts to a sweet and slightly teriaki flavored soy sauce marinade. The vinegar helps tenderize the relatively tough cut used. I personally added 1 tsp. liquid smoke and some coarse-ground black pepper (to taste). This really should not be called \"barbequed\" flank steak however since (for one thing) there is absolutely no smoke preparation nor any BBQ 'flavor' involved whatsoever. The most prominent taste is clearly soy sauce and the meat leans very strongly towards an Asian flair (not that there's anything wrong with that - in fact I'd even add some ginger root or powder next time to kick it up in that direction). This would really be best for thinly-cut (1/2 inch) flank steak to be pan-fried quickly and sliced over white rice or noodles maybe with some green onions water chestnuts and so on. For the purist or those looking for a traditional or truly \"london broil\" type preparation (or styled marinade) this probably isn't what you're looking for.",
