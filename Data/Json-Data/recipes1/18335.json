Unlike any store-bought marshmallow I've ever had, these tasted delicate and were softer.  My kids think I'm a superstar!  Be sure to grease the pan very well or the mixture will stick--this makes it more difficult to remove from the pan when they're dry enough.  Since I made bones for Halloween, I dipped my cutter into the powdered sugar/Argo cornstarch mixture before making each cut, pressed down hard, and wiggled slightly to ensure it went all the way through.  These are truly a delight--yumm!!!",

I greased the pan with pan spray and wiped out the excess and had no sticking. I read the reviews and went heavy on the powdered sugar to make cutting easy also. I even spread some all over the top and continuously while cutting the marshmallow with cookie cutters or into square ones with a knife. Do also coat the cutters and knife well with the powdered sugar too. Before cutting, I cooled them on the counter for about 7-8 hours with plastic wrap over the top of the pan. I can't imagine doing this without a stand mixer. It made it super easy. A very reliable thermometer is also neccessary. With the right tools, it is nearly fool proof. I thought they tasted kind of like a bagged marshmallows, but so much better with the soft fluffy texture. To top, they were excellent in homemade cocoa.",

I tried this one, it is the winner.  These marshmallows are fluffy and delicious.  The texture and flavor are heavenly.  I followed the instructions exactly as written, and I could not be more pleased with the result.  Here are a few tips I've learned over the years:  after buttering your pan, sprinkle lightly with powdered sugar.  I turn out the entire pan of dried, uncut marshmallows onto cutting board dusted with powdered sugar.  Then, I use a large pizza cutting wheel to cut the marshmallows into squares.  The blade will need to be dusted often with powdered sugar.  I use powdered sugar sparingly if I'll be dipping the cut marshmallows into melted chocolate.  I have also used finely chopped toasted coconut as a coating instead of powdered sugar for an old-fashioned treat.  One last tip, I use the wire whip beater on the Kitchen Aid stand mixer.  I think that contributes to the fluffy, light texture.",

In the end I used flavored extracts for the flavors I wanted. Had to make 4 batches to get 3 good ones but not the recipe's fault just me trying to be a smartie pants lol.

The key to not losing your mind when cutting these is powdered sugar- lots and lots of powdered sugar. Before cutting the marshmallows coat the whole block with powdered sugar. Before cutting coat the knife with powdered sugar and reapply any time the knife starts to stick. Any extra sugar can easily be shaken off of the finished product.",
