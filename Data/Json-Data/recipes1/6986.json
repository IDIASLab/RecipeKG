Sometimes I'll even add in a 1/4 tsp of baking powder per cup of flour I find that makes it even more tender.",

It worked great I just followed the directions and didn't even freeze the shortning or anything. My 3 year old took a little bit and worked it over and over and over as only a 3 year old can and when I eventually rolled it out and baked it with cinnamon sugar it was still incredible. The texture is so addicting. It's amazing. It's a different kind of flaky than the traditional pie recipe delivers. It's more of a melt-in-your-mouth kind of flaky. It's wonderful! I did brush the bottom with egg white before adding pie filling. I don't know whether it made a big difference but the end result was absolute perfection!",
