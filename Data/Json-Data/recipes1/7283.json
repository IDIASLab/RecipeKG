Instead of broiling I grilled over in-direct heat. I highly suggest a drip pan to avoid a fire. Very good but next time I will cut down on the amount of butter and lard to cut the fat may just use olive oil instead of the lard. Better for you and not the hassel or the mess of boiling the lard mixture.",
