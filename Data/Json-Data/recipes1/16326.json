I used Almond meal (from Trader Joe's) & raw sugar and lower glycemic palm sugar and batter was a bit gritty looking, but came out fine.  I used the brown rice flour as recipe called for, and was so good (I sometime use other gluten free flours, but this was just fine) and I sometimes cut sugar, don't do it here.  I also used my metal kitchen aid mixer bowl to stack on top of a regular pan since I had no official double broiler.  I have tried a couple recipes from Ghirardelli and it's ALWAYS wonderful!",

Nobody could tell they were gluten free, and my GF friends were delighted. Four stars for the recipe as written, but if you use almond butter instead, this becomes a five star recipe.",

I used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of bittersweet and Earth Butter instead of butter because my mum can't have milk fat (or gluten). I also recommend using light brown sugar instead of white sugar for brownies in general. Otherwise, I followed the directions to the word. The only issue I had with the recipe was that 25 minutes was not nearly long enough. I had to leave them in the oven for an extra 10 minutes.",

The original recipe calls for 3/4 cup of sugar which was too sweet for my tastes. I use about a half cup of organic sugar and even still they are a bit sweet but no one's complaining! I also found 6T of butter is a bit much and if you reduce it to 5T it is hardly noticeable. I use smart balance too. So feel free to fool around with this recipe, it is adaptable.
