I serve them as a side - as you would hash browns - with bacon & eggs. Frying them in the bacon pan doesn't hurt either. The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is that it's not quite as good as potato latkes. But it is good and is a great use of leftover mashed potatoes. If you're making these for the first time I recommend green onions or chives. Also be sure to make the pancakes more like the size of sausage patties. If you make them too big they'll fall apart when you turn them. Thanks for sharing this Deanne.",
