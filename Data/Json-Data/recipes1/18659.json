Way too much cream cheese while at the same time sorely wanting for butter milk or sour cream. The amount of cayenne pepper and garlic powder is extraordinarily excessive. Better with cooked and crumbled bacon. Finally I can't help but think the submitter intended for this to be sprinkled with maybe a 1/4 CUP of Parmesan not 1/4 tsp? After the above modifications as well as as the addition of a healthy amount of fresh chopped chives definitely 4-star quality - creamy and flavorful without assaulting the palate with an overload of garlic and cayenne.",
