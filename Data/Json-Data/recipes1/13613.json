For two chicken breast halves I mix and coat with 1/2c bread crumbs 2Tbl Ranch Dressing mix and a dash of paprika. Love it!",

Ranch DIP and ranch DRESSING mixes. Both made by the same company. If you use the DIP mix your chicken will be salty overpowering and will taste a bit like kitchen cleaner. Using the DRESSING mix gives the chicken a nice ranch flavor. Do NOT use the DIP packet. Made right this is easy to prepare and tasty. The chicken was so moist. I use two breasts and combine one ranch packet with 1/4 c. Italian bread crumbs. Just stick the seasonings in a bag wet the chicken shake it up and bake. I don't even find it necessary to pound in order to get a good juicy result. I bake at 350 and it's done in about 25 minutes. I will continue to make this in the future.",
