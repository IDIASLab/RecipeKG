The instructions for the provolone was way too much cheese and I would cut in half.  I would agree with the review with suggests simply laying all the different ingrediants side by side on a platter.  Great ingrediants, but be prepared to spend a few $$.  This is not an inexpensive recipe!  I'll try it again, and see if laying all the ingrediants side by side helps.  Nov. 2004 - Back again!  I tried this again with a few modifications and it was great.  Left out the lettuce, fresh mushrooms, green olives and gorganzola.  I was going for a very firm, compact dish and wanted to eliminate soft ingredients or anything that might be hard to cut.  I layered all the ingredients in a 13x9 dish and then place it into the freezer, just until it was very cold. (not frozen, though).  This enabled me to slice the dish into neat, bite sized squares which I then stuck a toothpick in and made an appetizer platter.  Great hit because of the small bite-sizes and all the low-carb dieters loved it!",

I agree with other reviewers that you shouldn't later the meat and cheese.  I will tailor my platter to the crowd I am serving too.  Some times it is just meat and cheese.  I agree to leave the dressing off the lettuce.  I do however drizzle my veggies and meat with a mixture of olive oil and oregano to add a little extra flavor since I usually don't serve dip with the platter.  I don't recommend putting the oil on the cheese though or it will get soggy.",

As suggested in some of the other reviews I decreased provolone to one pound. I also omited mushrooms and gorgonzola cheese. I cut the platter into serving pieces before adding the \"toppings\" (olives artichokes etc) which seemed to work well. I also added dressing just before serving to prevent everything from getting soggy. If you need to make this a day in advance I would suggest using romaine lettuce instead of iceberg-- it would hold up a little better. I highly suggest this recipe!",
