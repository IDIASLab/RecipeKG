Thankfully the app adjusts the serving size. With the help of the commentors I was able to play around with the recipe. I didn't have the cream cheese mentioned so I used what I had. Whipped cream cheese and then added garlic powder. I used a 6 cheese Italian blend cream of celery soup and red onion. When I tasted it all I could do was smile. DELICIOUS! My bf who has only had scalloped potatoes with cheddar loved it as well. Don't think I'll ever use a box again. Thank You All!",
