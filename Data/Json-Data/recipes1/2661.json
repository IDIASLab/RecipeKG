She said she didn't want coconut, so I left it out...but added 1 t. of coconut extract for the flavor. Other than than I made the cake exactly by the recipe.  I doubled the frosting recipe because I wanted to be sure that I had enough left over to decorate with..and I had plenty with even some left over.  You need a lot just because it's such a tall cake with the three layers.  Anyway, she said everyone loved it...and that the frosting was delicious!  I even took a picture of it and posted it...I was very pleased!",

                "reviewBody": "First off this cake was great! I changed things up a bit it may be something you might want to consider. The first thing I did differently was instead of round pans I used a 9X13 slab. It was easier to transport and cut I was able to get 16 very generous pieces you could get more if you cut smaller next time I will. Since this was following Christmas dinner I wanted to lighten things up a little (I dont mean calories here) So I used the cream cheese frosting in the middle and a thin layer on top (I cut the whole slab in 1/2) and then frosted the whole outside with sweetened whip cream. I think if I frosted the whole thing with the cream cheese it would have been to much for our already stuffed bellies. You will have a bit of leftover creamcheese icing ice some cookies or something. It was a really good cake the only reason why I didnt give it 5 stars was because it was a little denser than I would have liked but I did cut the cake in 1/2 while it was still warm so that may have caused a little deflation so I will never know if it was supposed to be like that or if it was my own fault. Probably the latter. It was pretty tasty though.",
