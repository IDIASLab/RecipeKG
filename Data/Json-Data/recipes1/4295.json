I\u2019d give it a one making it following the directions exactly as given.  I made the recipe following the recipe and found the package smoked sausage inappropriate for an Italian soup.  It was too salty using the bouillon powder and there wasn\u2019t enough broth.  The soup was also way too meaty and the sausage was very tough.  Here is my variation of this soup.  \r\n\r\nIngredients\r\n\r\n1 lb. hot Italian sausage, loose\r\n4 potatoes, cut into \u00bc inch slices\r\n1 cup chopped onion\r\n8 slices bacon, crispy\r\n2 teaspoons minced garlic\r\n2\u00bd (packed) cups kale, washed, dried, and shredded\r\n3 (14.5 oz.) cans chicken broth\r\n\u00bd cup heavy whipping cream\r\nfresh ground black pepper to taste\r\n\r\nDirections\r\n\r\n1.  Brown sausage in dutch oven, drain\r\n\r\n2.  In a griddle cook bacon until crispy, reserving grease, crumble, and set aside.  In just enough bacon grease, about one tablespoon, saut\u00e9 onions until almost clear.       \r\n\r\n3.  Add garlic to the onions and saut\u00e9 an additional 1 minute.  Add chicken broth, potatoes, and sausage.  Simmer until potatoes are cooked, about 45 minutes.\r\n\r\n4.  Add crumbled bacon, kale, cream, and fresh ground black pepper.

I also replaced the full-fat sausage with turkey kielbasa, which still gives great flavor. I used canned white Northern beans instead of potatoes since I was in a hurry. If you want the creaminess in the soup without all the fat, blend a drained can of Northern white beans with chicken broth (to the consistency you want)instead of the cream. I used chicken broth instead of the water(the brand Imagine has a boxed broth that costs the same as a can for the amount -- it's the best broth I've tasted). Also, you can get the same great flavor with only three or four pieces of bacon.",

Instead of smoked sausage, I used bulk Italian sausage and pre browned it in a skillet before adding in. I also upped the water to 1 1/2 Q and found that the sausage added to the flavor just fine. I also dropped the cream to 1/2 C instad of 1/3. Finally, I find using a thick smokehouse bacon to be the best for this recipe.",
