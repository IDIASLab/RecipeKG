I didn't have tomato paste so I just omitted it. I subbed shredded mozzarella for the provolone 1 beefsteak tomato for the 3 roma tomatoes spinach and cheese tortellini for the rainbow tortellini pepperoni for the salami orange bell pepper for the red and dried herbs for the fresh (I just used about 1/2 as much maybe less). I completely forgot the lemon juice even though it was right on the counter in front of me. LOL! I do think that this recipe makes too much vinaigrette--I only used half and it was plenty to coat the salad and provide excellent flavor. It would be good for regular salad too so I put the rest in the fridge to use later but I would halve it next time. I didn't add salt and pepper to the final product although I did add some to the vinaigrette. I don't think you need much salt and pepper if at all--plenty of other flavors going on in this salad!",

That I made in a food processor and poured into the cruet that comes with good seasoning dressing. While it does not hold every drop you don't need it all anyway. About an hour before serving I took it out of the fridge and pour about half the dressing on it. Once it came to room temp I poured about half what was left on it so it was moist but not soggy. Everyone loved it. The tomato based vinergarette was a nice change. The only subs I made were changing out the provolone with mozzarella and omitting rosemary. Purely personal taste. There are alot of ingredients but it's stuff you probably have anyway. Glad I made it the day before because it was a little time consuming. Thanks Nicole!",

I also made the following changes: I halved the dressing recipe but still used 2.5 tomatoes I added sauteed mushrooms used red green and yellow peppers I omitted the tomato paste and fresh spices because I was out and added red pepper flakes and lots of freshly ground pepper. Instead of grating the provolone I cut up little cubes adding even more texture and flavor. I think you could add any a variety of vegetables to this recipe and the dressing could be used for a variety of things as well! I would make this recipe again. UPDATE: I made this once again cutting up cubes of provolone but also added mozzarella balls and used herb paste. Once again delicious.",
