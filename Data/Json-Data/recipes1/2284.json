These waffles were crisp on the outside but soft on the inside--very fluffy. I served these with homemade raspberry sauce and we all loved them. NOTE: When I whipped the egg whites, I made sure to chill my Kitchen Aid mixer bowl and the whipping attachment itself before trying to whip them. I really only had an hour but that was just enough time to give me the help I needed. My egg whites seemed to whip up faster and they were quite fluffy.",

It's important not to mix these up too much after you fold in the egg whites or they will be flat and chewy. The waffles are fluffy and light because of the egg whites. Also, be sure not to under-cook them. Then they'll turn out soggy. Spray your waffle iron with cooking spray, and make sure they're lightly browned. That's what separates them from the mix. They're wonderful!",
