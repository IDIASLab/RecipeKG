I also added to the dressing, worchester sauce, soy sauce and lemon pepper marinade per the recommendation of another reviewer. Adding pinapple chunks along with red and green bell pepper and onion really rounds out this dish.  Only change I would make is to use less meat tenderizer (to much salt). I served this with a fruit salad and french bread.  After one bite, my husband confirmed this one is a keeper.  Thanks Chris!",

Then I followed the advice of the other reviewers and added a splash of soy sauce and a splash of worcestershire and a shake of lemon pepper to the recipe and marinated the chicken for about 3 hours. Then I threw a handful of hickory chips on the gas grill and cooked the chicken on metal skewers along with some mushrooms. I started the grill on medium but quickly turned the heat down to low to keep the chicken from burning. It took about 5-7 minutes a side to get done. The smell while cooking was unbelievably appetizing but the taste was even better! You gotta try this one!",

She added a splash of soy and worchestershire sauce to the marinade and put the meat in the refrigerator for 3 hours. She made them a bit fancy by using chicken and steak and added peppers onion mushrooms pineapple and mandarin oranges to the kabobs. They were fantastic. Will try to marinate the steak over night next time to get it really tender. Thanks for the recipe.",
