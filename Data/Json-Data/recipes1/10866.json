With those caveats I found the results to be a little disappointing flavor-wise. But I had very high expectations so this just resulted in this being \"pretty good\" in my book. The filets with the shallots and garlic were very tasty but I found my wine sauce to be fairly bland. Step 1 wasn't too clear (to this beginner) about what heat (low medium high boil) to reduce the sauce on. I had it too low then cranked it up and it still took me 1.5 hours to get 3 cups of sauce. And I don't think the 2-3 minutes in step 3 was enough to thicken the sauce either. I may try this recipe again though - it has a lot of potential but I've got to get the hang of making sauces like this.",

I used 1 chicken and 1 beef oxo cube and let the cubes dissolve in 2 cups of boiling water. Then I added 1/2 cup of wine and let the mixture boil for almost 30 minutes on high heat. The only thing I didn't like is that I usually marinate my steak so that the flavor goes through to the center and the meat becomes more tender. These were ok but I had to dip them in a lot of gravy and they weren't as tender as the steaks I usually have. Also the recipe directions will give you a rare steak so if you don't like it rare cook a couple of minutes longer.",
