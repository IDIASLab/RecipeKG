It has taken me forever to use up my candied fruit however so I was not about to buy another couple of containers and start over. This bread is very moist even though it had quite a crust on it. Mine was done at an hour surprisingly as my oven often requires longer for quick breads. It's very pretty but not my favorite--but I'm not so sure I like candied fruit much. I did like the currants in this. Thanks for the recipe!",

I actually used about 1/4 cup more fruit in total too. I like it. I think the ginger is an excellent addition. I'm not too fond of how hard and crusty the outside of the bread got but I think if I had covered it right after it came out of the oven it would have softened a lot more. I'm not sure if I'll use this particular recipe again but I like the concept quite a bit.",
