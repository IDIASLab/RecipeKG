I am a lawyer with a newborn child and this recipe is easy enough for me to cook on the weekend to take some of the pressure off of my wife for later in the week. What's more my wife and other children think this is a great meal perfect for cold winter days. I've made two adjustments. First I use the very spicy V8 brand vegetable juice and the result is not as spicy as you might imagine owing (I suppose) to the ameliorative effect of the lentils. Second I double or triple the amount of mushrooms. They have enough substance (as if they were meat) and they absorb the flavor from the soup so well that it is worth having more of them around. Really this is worth a try. We've made it a weekly event lately because a double-batch provides enough lunch for the week.",

Added 3 4.5 oz cans of mushrooms since my guy is a mushroom-lover. Definitely salty enough but we thought it needed a little something more for our taste. Added some onion powder garlic powder and cayenne for a little zip. Excellent thick soup made even better with a crusty loaf of bread! For added convenience make this in the morning and let it cook all day in your slow cooker. Thanks for the recipe!",

I did follow the advice of others...in addition to the listed ingredients I added a chopped jalapeno cumin and a can of diced tomatoes. I used spicy V8 for the tomato juice and beef broth in place of the water and bouillon. I did not add salt because of the salt content already present. Next time I think I will use less liquid...there seemed to be way too much broth and tomato juice for the amount of \"stuff\".",
