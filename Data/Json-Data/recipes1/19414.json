I'm not a fan of onions and the Marsala blend is loaded with them but the Mushroom blend had a nice assortment of mushrooms all in one package. The recipe for the Chicken Marsala is really basic and I found that the dish really needed seasoning especially salt and pepper but with some minor tweaks it was a quick and easy meal. I'd try this again for those nights where I don't have time to put together a large dinner.",
