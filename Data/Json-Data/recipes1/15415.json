One 14.25 ounce box of Chocolate Chex mix is just over 9 cups so I put the whole box in. I increased the butter to one stick (or 8 TBS) increased brown sugar to 1 full cup packed plus 1 heaping TBS and increased corn syrup to 4 TBS and a 1/4 plus a little more tsp of the baking soda. It was a little work to mix it all up but WELL worth it in the end! Left out the chocolate drizzle as this didn't add much to the treats and was quite messy if you pick up a handful to munch. You won't miss it honest. This has turned into our favorite!",

I think it tastes fantastic without it and would make it messy if you had chocolate drizzle (melting on fingers, etc.)  I agree with a pp who said nuts would be good with this.  As I write this, I am snacking on this mix with some almonds.  Perfect combo of sweet and salty.  Recipe gets brownie points b/c it is all made in the microwave. WooHoo!!!",

I'd make it myself but come one some things are just better with mom's special touch:) She's made it by drizzling white chocolate milk chocolate a combo. For halloween she didn't drizzle chocolate but she put in colored m&ms. It's really easy to change things up a little to make it look a little more festive.

I let it simmer for about 3 minutes then stirred in the baking soda let it simmer for about 15-30 sec more (stirring constantly) and then poured over the cereal. You have to work fast before it hardens up or put your mixing bowl with cereal over another bowl of hot water to keep it \"loose\". I then drizzled with melted peanut butter chips and YUM!",
