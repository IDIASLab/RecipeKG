NOTE: If you melt the chocolate with the butter and let it cool just a bit add in the nuts and then pour it over the marshmallows it works a little easier.",

An easier version is to spread the coconut onto a peice of wax paper and place the mixture tube length down the sheet then just roll the rest in cocunut wrap with wax paper and place in fridge overnight. Just cut the next morning (I used my electrical knife). I think next time I'll try half semi-sweet chips half milk chocalate chips for a cremier taste.",
