I substituted Mozzarella cheese for the Parmesan cheese and peas for corn.  I also used about 1/2 the mayo and added plenty of Garlic Garlic from Tastefully Simple.  I added a can of drained mushrooms too.  I didn't have garlic mushroom soup so I used regular mushroom soup.  The flavor is FANTASTIC, but it is really soupy as other reviewers reported.  I really didn't have a problem with it though.  This dish is even better the next day!  I will fix this one for my family again with the changes that I made.",

I served corn on the side and our family traditional homemade whipped potatoes and the bacon cheddar deviled eggs I found on here. I cut the breast in strips and dredged them in flour seasoned with salt papper and garlic powder. I fried the chicken in olive oil to brown then removed them to the baking dish.I put over 1/2 cup of parmesan since I didn't wanna leave such a small amount in the container and we love it so it couldn't be bad. I also added garlic to the sauce cuz well we love garlic. I also sauted mushrooms in margarine(I Can't Believe It's Not Butter) and added the mushrooms and the margarine to the sauce. I put a little over 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese to cover the top real good and over a cup of dry Stove Top Stuffing to cover the top real good. this was really awesome and I am sure to make it again. Thanks so much!!!",
