Drain it then add the rest of ingredients.  (My pepperoni was just too soggy.)  I also put the cheese on top and then topped with more pepperoni.  It just gave it a nice presentation.  And lastly, you will definately need more spegetti sauce.  I added 3/4 of another jar.  My 5 year old loved this recipe.  Next time I will make some garlic bread too.",

The slices are still pliable and you wont be adding all that fat into the casserole. As written the recipe is pretty basic, I wanted to punch up the flavor. I cooked the beef, drained the fat and added chunks of red onion, minced garlic, red pepper flakes and oregano. I cooked that just for a minute or two. I used a pound of pasta because I think just 8 ounces is not enough for all of the meat in the recipe. I added sliced black olives also. It turned out good.",

I browned the ground beef with seasoning salt, a dash of chili powder, hot sauce, and Italian seasoning. I added chopped pepperoni to the beef as well as chopped red onion, browned it all together, then added the mixture to the rotini with a jar of pasta sauce mixed with hot sauce. I topped it with mozza and a bit of cheddar, and sprinkled with a bit more Italian seasoning. I took the casserole out when the cheese was browned, and I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top. This recipe is basic and can very easily be tweaked, you don't have to follow the directions to the t if you don't want to. Next time I will add mushrooms and peppers to the casserole.",

I used two 15 oz cans tomato sauce instead of the jar of spaghetti sauce (I didn't experience any dryness this way). I also used 2 cups mozerella along with about a cup of cheddar, and this turned out to be perfect. I didn't have any pepperoni, but neither I or my husband really missed them. My husband also doesn't like biting into onions, so I just used onion & garlic powder along with some Italian seasoning. I cooked the ground beef in extra virgin olive oil and we both agreed it was a good choice. The end result was tasty enough and easy to make. Next time I will toy around more with the seasoning.
