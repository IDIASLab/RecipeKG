I also used a chocolate frosting on it that is almost identicle to the \"creamy chocolate frosting\" on this site. The cake and frosting complimented eachother perfectly. In the middle i sliced fresh banana's and also used sliced banana's to create a flower pattern on the top. Not only did it look beautiful but it tasted amazing. Next time...instead of 8 inch pans i would prefer to use 9 or 10 so that there is not so much cake between the frosting layers. This recipe was superb though. No need to search for other banana recipes. :)",

In other words I happily found this to be a real banana cake not banana bread posing as one. I am a huge fan of baked goods made with buttermilk - in my experience I've yet to make a recipe where the buttermilk didn't absolutely guarantee moist and delicious success. And it was the same with this recipe. Bold banana flavor fluffy moist and prettily speckled with brown flecks that made this perfect to frost with a chocolate frosting. I used this recipe for 24 cupcakes and frosted them with \"Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting \" also from this site. It was a match made in heaven - they were one of those rare things you make that was so good so delicious it becomes etched in your memory. One criticism however. It would be helpful to have given an actual measurement in cups for the bananas rather than \"four bananas \" since bananas can vary greatly in size and so then will the yield. (I hope it's helpful that I've always found 1 banana=1/2 cup mashed bananas is a good rule of thumb)",

For a banana CAKE, however, I think a more tender, soft texture is in order.  To accomplish this, I substituted cake flour in place of all-purpose flour.  And you just gotta have vanilla extract in a cake; I added 1 teaspoon.  And, dependent on the size of the bananas you've got, \"4 ripe bananas\" can yield anywhere from 1 cup to 1 1/2 cups of the stuff.  My 4 bananas amounted to 1 1/3 cups and this quantity worked fine.  I frosted the cake with a cream cheese frosting and pressed the walnuts onto the sides of the cake.  It cut beautifully and my guests (and I) loved it.",

So I had no idea what to do since I am known as the cake maker in the office. I found this recipe and it was so yummy!!! I didn't change one thing except I did put crushed walnuts on top of the icing and used 5 bananas.TIP: My Mother-In-Law told me that if you have bananas that are really really ripe and you can't make anything out of them at the time you can freeze them and use them later for bread or whatever. So last summer I had frozen some and thought I would try them in this cake. It worked perfectly a little mushy to get in the bowl and you want to watch the strings on the bananas and get them off before you smoosh them. This cake got RAVE reviews and the girl loved her birthday cake! Thanks for another great recipe!!!",

Same with the texture: denser than a cake, but \"sponge-ier\" than banana bread would be.  Maybe best as muffins? I make banana bread/cake/muffins often to use up bananas at the end of the week.  Probably won't make this recipe again, as I have others my family likes more.",
