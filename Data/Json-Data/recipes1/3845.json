Whenever you make caramel sauce, you should always cook the sugar with the butter ONLY until it reaches a \"soft\" ball stage - after about 5 minutes of continuous surface bubbling. Only THEN do you add the cream or milk and vanilla. You won't end up with that greasy separated mess that some have described. Serving the warm sauce over the sweet cake and a lump of vanilla ice cream is a perfect way to end a special evening's meal.",

                "reviewBody": "A similar recipe calls for 1 cup of water to be brought to the boil in a saucepan with about a cup of chopped dates (you can use dried chopped dates instead of fresh if these are not available). Then take it off the heat and add the 1 teaspoon of Baking Soda. It will fizz up quite a bit so don't be alarmed. Leave it to cool while you pretty much follow the rest of this recipe. The recipe I have calls for more flour though (1 1/2 cups of self-rising flour) which may explain why some found this version to be \"mushy\". I have found that this cooks very well in a greased glass 9-inch pie dish cooked for about 40-45 mins. I only gave this version 4 stars though because the other recipe makes a richer, better tasting sauce. (Dissolve 1 1/2 cups firmly packed brown sugar in 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, stir over heat without boiling. When sugar is dissolved take it off the heat and add 1 stick and 1 Tbs chopped butter, stir until dissolved). You can serve the sauce poured over the pudding if you like a cake-like consistency but if you like a \"gooier\" sticky pudding, poke some holes in the top and spoon some of the sauce over it so it soaks in. You can then serve with more sauce if wanted. Hope this additional information helps and that you enjoy this traditional \"down under\" favourite!",

                "reviewBody": "I have been making a very similar recipe for over 20 years.   Five star recipe, four star for the confusing instructions in this recipe.   Combine the pitted dates (my recipe specifies 8 oz), baking soda and boiling water (just 1 cup) in a food processor to chop until they are very fine.   The mixture will be foamy.    If you don't have self rising flour use regular flour and add 1/2 tsp. baking powder.  The cake can be baked in a 9x9 or 13x9 pan.  It's always nicely set in 35-45 minutes.  My toffee sauce is different -  1-1/2 cups heavy cream, 3/4 cup unsalted butter, 1/2 cup DARK brown sugar.  Combine all in saucepan over low heat until melted.  Simmer gently for 20 min. or until thick, stirring often.  Don't boil this!  I would think that the evaporated milk would make the sauce too sweet.  This very moist cake freezes well.   I've successfully made the toffee sauce earlier in the day and reheated it just before serving. Warm the cake before serving, top with toffee sauce and a dollop of real whipped cream sweetened with just a little sugar.  A traditional Christmas dessert in our home.",

I'm used to pudding cakes being more 'pudding' like. If you follow what the recipe says it still turns out a really tasty moist cake with a surprising amount of flavor...I can hardly keep my hands off of it:)",

The directions say to just cover the dates with boiling water but at the end of the ingredient list 1-1/2 cups of boiling water is listed. I'm sure I didn't have that much boiling water which is why the cake was drier. Also my sauce separated and was not the smooth caramel sauce I expected.
