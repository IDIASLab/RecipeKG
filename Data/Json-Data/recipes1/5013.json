That glaze took these over the top to something outrageously delicious - buttery, creamy with white chocolate, unmistakably orange and very rich.  A thick, soft and tender cookie.  Adding orange extract as some others have is NOT necessary. Adding the fresh orange glaze, on the other hand, is.  Mmmmmm.",

Let the cookie set until the chocolate firms up. It makes them look pretty and adds another layer of flavor. My friend always brought these to a cookie swap at church and when she moved to Florida we wouldn't let her leave until she gave out the recipe.
