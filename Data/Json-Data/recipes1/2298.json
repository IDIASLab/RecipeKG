It's almost the consistency of fudge that didn't set properly (I followed the recipe to a T). It might be OK in a 9 inch pie pan but the double recipe makes a filling that completely fills a 9x13 which is too much given the texture and consistency. The flavor isn't \"bad\" but I didn't find it to be worth the expense and bother. My recommendation is to halve the recipe (very easy to do as it's written) and try it as one 9 inch pie first to see if you like it. If you decide to try the 9x13 version save a little money and get one 28oz jar of peanut butter. You won't miss the extra 4 ounces.",

I used a 9x13 pan and it was so easy to pop out of the freezer when guests would arrive. There's plenty to go around too. I used the 28 ounce jar of peanut butter and the pie tasted fine without the garnish. Will make this again!",
