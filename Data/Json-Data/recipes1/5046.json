The one thing is that I think the quantity of spaghetti sauce at 16 ounces is a mistake.  I looked and looked at the grocery store but I didn't find any 16 oz jars, only 26 oz jars... that and the complaints from other users that this dish was dry leads me to believe the author meant 26 oz not 16.  So I used a whole 26 oz jar of spaghetti sauce and it was perfect, not too saucey and not dry at all.  Just right.  I froze the other 6x8\" dish and will reheat it for dinner in a few weeks.  My husband, who is not a very big pasta fan, thought it was delicious.",

My in-laws came out the next day and the leftovers were gobbled up in seconds. Next time I think I will use ricotta cheese instead of mozzerella as it will add better flavor and add more moisture to the noodles during re-heating. The only bad thing about this recipe is that is really dirties a lot of dishes. Next time I will simply defrost the spinach instead of cooking it and I will go ahead and mix it together with the eggs cheese and oil right in the baking dish. Very good stuff this will become a weekly meal in our house and the leftovers make good lunches.",

I cut the pasta down to a cup and a half, I used ground turkey, and I increased the onion to a whole onion and the garlic to four or so cloves. I did spice up the sauce with more spice (italian seasoning, onion/garlic powder, fresh ground pepper and a glug of red wine). I did add a little fresh grated parmesan to the spinach/pasta layer. I spread a little extra shredded mozzerella over the top along with fresh grated parmesan. This was very easy and really makes quite a bit. I appreciate that as this is going to be lunch for my husband for a couple days, too. We all enjoyed this quite a bit and I loved that it's easily bendable to use healthier/organic ingredients and whatever you have on hand to pull it together and make it your own.",

Even with that change it still could have used a little more sauce to get some moisture down into the pasta layer. Or maybe it needs to be 4 alternate layers to distribute a little more evenly. I used a combination of mozzarella & cheddar but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Definite changes next time to get a better dish. It has potential! Thanks for the decent start.

I did mix in about a cup of cottage cheese inwith the pasta-spinach mixture and seasoned with some garlic powder and Italian herbs. I put fresh basil in my sauce towrds the end as well as a pinch of red pepper flakes. My son gobbled this down saying it was almost as good as homemade lasagna and not nearly the work.
