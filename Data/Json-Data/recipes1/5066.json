The dough was more like a runny batter so the cookies came out very flat. Refrigerating the batter helped the second batch rise a bit better. I added chocolate chips which the kids loved. Nice banana flavor. Texture is more like a pancake than a cookie. They get mushy when you store them. I think I'll try another recipe next time...",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great little recipe especially for the kids! It's like having banana-nut bread in a cookie. I changed a few measurements and ingredients and found that the recipe worked a bit better. First I used only 1 teaspoon of baking powder--it was more than enough. Second I added close to a cup of ground walnuts I processed in the food processor. Finally instead of shortening I used butter and just a tab bit more about a tablespoon more. I pre-mixed the dry ingredients including the nuts. Since the batter was extra moist I used a spoon and knife to form generous round teaspoonfuls on the cookie sheet. Next time I'll try adding a bit more lemon extract; 1/2 teaspoon plus. These cookies are great iced especially with a thin lemon icing but also equally as good with just a sprinkle of powdered sugar or plain. This recipe is easily altered like most banana breads. ENJOY!",

I doctored mine up a bit. I used butter instead of shortening as others have suggested. This cake needed some flavor. I used Almond extract instead of lemon added about 1tsp of cinnamon 1/4 to 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a sprinkle of ground ginger. They tasted amazing. I also added chopped pecans to half the batter and finished them with powdered sugar. mmmmmm. The next day we even warmed them up again and topped with a vanilla or pumpkin ice cream. Great fall treat. Chocolate chips might be good too.",
