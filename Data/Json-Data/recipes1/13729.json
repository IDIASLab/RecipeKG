I think a cinnamon raison bread would be yummy but as I try to eat whole grain products, I used whole wheat bread.  I may add some raisons next time and make half with nutmeg to see which flavor we like best.  My company had a choice of eating it plain (which was fine) or topping it with pourable Splenda, sugar, syrup, or fresh strawberries.",

It was very easy to make and eventhough I didn't have any nutmeg and didnt add any orange zest it still turned out delicious! I did however add 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and increased the vanilla extract to 1/2 teaspoon(personal preference). I also melted the butter and mixed it in with the rest of the ingredients. After cutting the (french) bread I then diped/soaked every single bread piece into the bowl of ingredients. I single layered the pan with the soaked bread placed in refrigerator overnight 5 hours later I flipped every piece of bread over and placed back in the refrigerator 4 hours later I took out of fridge and sprinkled the pecans on top. I then placed in oven as recommended at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. The whole fam loved it including my hard to please little brother:-)! I will definitely make again!",
