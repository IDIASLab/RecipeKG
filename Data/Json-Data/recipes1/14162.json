I fixed it just as it says,. except I put my potatoes in the microwave for 2 minutes then turned them over for another 2 minutes, cut them in half and brushed the tops with olive oil mixture.

Added crushed fresh garlic instead of powder, and grilled both the skin and the \"flesh\" until nicely browned and crunchy on the outside.  In my opinion, there's no need to drizzle the remaining oil afterwards, it tastes great as is.  Make sure to add a little salt on top while they're still warm.  Made this for a family barbeque, and got rave reviews.  Easy to make-ahead- just pre-cook the potatoes and store in fridge with oil mixture until ready to use, then grill. UPDATE 8/19/10 I tried this basic method with sweet potatoes, cut in thick slices.  YUM!  Fresh Garlic and Rosemary are the best!",
