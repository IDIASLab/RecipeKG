Everything turned out alright except I had a hard time getting the whipping cream to whip (sans electric mixer) so I went and bought some whipped cream and that worked fine. If you do that I would probably suggest adding more than the 1 cup they have for the recipe. The 1/4 cup cream de menthe wasn't overly powering. On some pieces I could taste it more than others but I'd stick with the 1/4 cup. Other than that it turned out well! I also used a pre-made Oreo pie crust so good!",
