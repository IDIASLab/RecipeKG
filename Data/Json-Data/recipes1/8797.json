However, I always make recipes before I give them away.  But this one I didn't.  You see, I don't like soup at all.  But I know a lot of people do, especially in the winter.  I've never gotten a \"bad\" recipe from this website, so I figured \"4 stars...GREAT!\"  Well, that must've been on presentation only, because numerous people have come up to me to tell me that the soup wasn't good and that the recipe wasn't correct.  (I felt awful!)  Apparently the liquid isn't adaquate at all.  And when you do add enough liquid to make it \"soupy\" then it makes 2 VERY LARGE POTS of soup!  Not bad if you are having company, but it should say that on the label.  I won't make this recipe again.",

I think the essence of \"in a jar\" recipes is supposed to be homemade convenience foods, something that can be put together with little effort. I do think that size varies too much in the ingredients and would probably opt for some other pasta shapes that are more uniform to the overall appearance.",
