However the food coloring and flavoring is really optional. I used only 1/4 tsp. peppermint extract for the whole recipe.  Then I added a whole bottle of red food coloring and extra powdered sugar to make up for the extra liquid. I pinched the dough and rolled it into small balls, dipped them in white sugar then pressed them into candy molds. I left them out to dry for about 6 hours and then refrigerated them. They were a great success at my sister's wedding. She even took a box with her on her honeymoon!",

Our recipe calls for 1 teaspoon total flavoring for the entire recipe. (I like 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 peppermint--almond is also very good) You also must use paste or gel food coloring or it will get too soft & sticky.  The humidity can also effect this.  I recommend refrigerating the dough & adding more powdered sugar if this happens.  Also, we just roll into balls, dip in sugar & always use rubber molds.  If done right, these are the BEST!",

There was enough flavoring but they still just tasted like powdered sugar and cream cheese - frosting! They did set up nicely in the fridge but they were very difficult to work with and there was no way we could have rolled them out! We ended up rolling them into balls and then pushing them a little flat with our fingers. Sad to say it's not one I would try again.",
