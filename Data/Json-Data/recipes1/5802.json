I only used a little bit more than 1 cup of cherries and cranberries mixed because that was all I had. It seemed to be plenty. I didn't freeze the dough but used parchment paper to shape into a log and refrigerated it for 2 hours. It was plenty firm enough to slice. The cookies were HUGE. When I make these again I will make 2 logs smaller in diameter. It did make 23 cookies but could have made many more if the logs weren't so big. They sort of had a shortbread airy texture. I had 3 cookies that didn't fit on the first cookie sheet so I put them on a second sheet on the bottom rack. DON'T do that! They got too dark on the bottom and not browned on top. The baking time was MUCH longer than stated (8 to 10 minutes longer) so I had to keep setting the timer for 2 more minutes (I get distracted) and checking them again. Try these cookies! BTW...it only got 4 stars because the baking time was so off and the directions to freeze were unnecessary. I didn't use the white confectionary coating. It would look pretty but I don't think it needs it.",
