I always find that when I buy a jar for a recipe I only end up using about half and end up tossing the rest because it just sits in my fridge. Not anymore! This recipe couldn't be easier! I tried using a double layer of cheesecloth and realized it wasn't straining well so I removed the cheesecloth and just used my fine mesh strainer. I was able to push the oil mixture through with the back of a spoon to get it all strained. I seasoned this with some cracked black pepper and a sprinkle of salt. The salt is necessary in my opinion and takes the oil from just \"good\" to \"amazing\"!",

Instead of buying expensive roasted peppers in a jar make your own. Just use the oil from the recipe and cover fresh bell peppers with seeds removed and roughly torn. Cook in oven at 300 for 1 to 2 hours until very soft. Then pass through a fine strainer aka shin chinois. You could also add peeled garlic cloves",
