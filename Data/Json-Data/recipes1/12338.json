You need to whisk vigorously & don't allow the simmering water to touch the bottom of the custard pan. I did as Mousie suggested & allowed it to thicken before adding the wine (I used Muscat instead of Marsala) & the wine thinned it out quite a bit but it soon thickened right back up. I served it in vintage sherbet glasses & topped each w/ two beautiful huge strawberries & sprinkled a little raw sugar over it all. Wsa beautiful & had an awesome flavor!",
