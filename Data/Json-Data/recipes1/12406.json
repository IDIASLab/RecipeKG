I was concerned about the incredibly large amount of bananas, and the texture and consistency it would lend to the ice cream--that many bananas surely would compete with the \"cream\" in ice cream (as other reviewers indeed noted). As it is, I used half as many bananas and it was plenty banana flavored. Because bananas are sweet on their own, I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup and it was perfect. I like my ice cream rich, so I added an egg, and replaced the milk with half and half.  I also left out the vanilla as I felt it wasn't necessary. Finally, I eliminated the nuts just because that was hubby's request, and used good, chopped, bittersweet chocolate rather than the chocolate chips. A food processor or blender isn't necessary and only makes more dishes to wash. Whisk the egg for a minute or two till light and fluffy, add the sugar and whisk another minute or so to dissolve it. Mash the bananas with a fork and add to the egg/sugar mixture with the cream, half and half and lemon juice.  Chill for several hours before churning. It turned out intensely rich, velvety, and packed with fresh banana flavor--a 5-star ice cream. ",

I also used a frozen bittersweet Lindt chocolate bar instead of the chips and added a hint a cinnamon to add a homemade touch. One trick to making ice cream work in an ice cream maker is to make sure both the canister and the paddle are very very frozen. I usually freeze at least 2 days ahead of time and remove canister from freezer just before mixture is ready to pour into canister.",
