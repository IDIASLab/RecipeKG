It looked so elegant and attractive; the colors of the lemon and raspberry are so pretty. THEN we ate it!!! For so few ingredients and little prep time this is delicious dessert to serve for any occasion. I've shared this recipe with others. Karen",

Chambord was 22.99 which was an expensive ingredient given we only needed 3 TBSP. I looked into making my own raspberry liqueur but it needed anywhere from 4 days to 4 weeks to 'cure' depending on the recipe. In the end we opted for Montbisou raspberry liqueur (13.99) which was less expensive than Chambord plus it won an award in 2015. We found it to have a true raspberry flavor not overly sweet and not syrupy. The dessert comes together quickly and is actually as easy to make as baking a cake. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing this recipe racheljk!",
