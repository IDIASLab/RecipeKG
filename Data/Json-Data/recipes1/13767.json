                "reviewBody": "There are lots of ways to do this. Personally I line a pan with foil, cut my pumpkin in half horizontally (whatever kind, I've used sugar pumpkins, pie pumpkins, and even some sort of fat mystery pumpkin), remove the insides, spray PAM on the foil, put the pumpkin cut-side down, and roast that baby for an hour or so. After an hour I lift the edge of the side with the stem and poke the pumpkin flesh gently with a fork. If it feels like a baked potato, I take it out, if not, I keep baking it until it DOES feel like a baked potato. I let the hot pumpkin rest about 15 minutes before I take a spoon and scoop out the flesh. I mash it while it's hot, but pureeing is probably even better - I just have never needed to. Your baking time will vary quite a bit based on the temperature of your pumpkin going in - if you were storing it on the porch then it's going to take longer because the pumpkin is colder :=) Thanks for the recipe! (Note: sometimes the emptied out pumpkin shell will dry hard and crisp, and the empty shell can be put back out on the porch as long as it stays cold outside in your environment! This varies based on species of pumpkin, whether or not you cooked it long enough to harden but not blister the skin, and how well you scraped it.)",

This worked perfect.  Two pumpkins, apprx 12 in in diameter made roughly a gallon of pumpkin puree.  I had four halves and roasted them in the oven for about 1 hour and 15 minutes.  the two in the very back where like baked sweet potatoes, flaky and fluffy.  The two in the front where not as done , chunky, and worked just as well.  Scoop out the pulp and put it in a blender.  I attempted to strain the puree only to find out that I didn't need to.  It was perfect.  Thanks gidget for the helpful tip on pumpkin puree.  For $2 at the farmers market I have enough pumpkin puree to make 16 pumpkin pies using two cups of puree per pie! Beautiful Job!",

I have never had probs with stringy bits as it is pureed in blender. I let it sit in a seive for a few hours to get out as much water as possible if you do not do this step when you thaw out your pumpkin you will lose some to fluid and your recipes will have too much liquid.

But my small-sized sugar pumpkin was still rock hard after baking for 1 hour and that was cut into little chunks. Instead I boiled the chucks until soft then used a hand held blender to puree the pumpkin. I imagine if I had more patience baking the pumpkin would work too.
