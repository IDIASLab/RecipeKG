In a large saucepan I sauteed the onion in some butter and then added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and the pork, along with some herbs and spices.  I added 1/2 cup of white wine and simmered the pork until it was done.  Then I added two cans of cream of mushroom soup and simmered the mixture until the rice was done.  As soon as the rice was done, I added it to the pot.  I didn't bother with any cheese or bother putting it in a 9 x 13 pan and heating it up.  It was already plenty hot so I just served it right out of the large saucepan.  It was so good and easy.  Next time I will try it with chicken and some fresh mushrooms.  Thanks for the recipe!",
