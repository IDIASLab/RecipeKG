I wasn't looking forward to his reaction to the cake as I'd already suffered criticism over dinner but when he tasted it he just went crazy. It was like he couldn't stop eating it. We finished over half the loaf that night. It's the best cake I've ever tasted and I wouldn't change a thing. Oh wait I did change a couple of things. I used brown sugar instead of white and left out the chocolate chips and walnuts because I wanted a more gingerbread-like flavour. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 2 tsp baking powder as I didn't have any baking soda. I think next time I may add raisins in place of the chocolate chips and walnuts. I think they'd go well with the taste.",
