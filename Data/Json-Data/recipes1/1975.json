This one is pretty darn close.:-) I used evaporated milk and the juice of three lemons rather than just two. The next time I make it I'll reduce the sugar a little because it was a little sweeter than I remember. A standard 9\" pie crust was a little too shallow for the custard - next time I'll try a deep-dish pie crust. And I'm still trying to work out the perfect baking time. All in all this is a great recipe - with a little tweaking I think it'll be perfect!",
