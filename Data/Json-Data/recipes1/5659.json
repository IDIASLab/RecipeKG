I made this for a wedding shower and it was a big hit - even with non-vegetarians. Also, this can be made a day in advance and then baked right before serving.",

Every person I make it for asks me for the recipe or asks me to make it again and again.\n\nOver the years I have played around with the ingredients, which is another reason I love the recipe. You can add your favorite veggies or change the sauce and it always comes out great. One time I even added chicken for a chicken lover. \n\nI found a couple short-cuts to make it quicker to prepare: Leaving the water in the spinach works fine. Slicing the mushrooms with an egg slicer is very quick!\n\nThe only permanent change I have made to the recipe is the sauce. I use one 16-oz jar of Classico Sun-Dried Tomato Alfredo and it's delicious in the recipe! ",

I used Buitoni refrigerated alfredo sauce because there was some criticism of jarred sauce.  And I substituted sundried tomatoes for the carrots- would highly recommend this as they really added to the flavor of the dish.  I used 2 cups of mozzarella- on top of each veggie layer and again on top.  I squeezed the spinach dry after microwaving (which I think is implied in the recipe, but not explictly stated), used no-boil lasagna noodles (no problem with them turning out too crunchy) and didn't use the added milk.  It was a little too runny when I checked it after 60 minutes, so I continued to cook it uncovered for the final 15 minutes.  Highly recommend- it's going in my permanent file!",

I loved the addition of BROCCOLI to this (10 oz. box of finely chopped, or use half broccoli and half spinach). TIP: Use pre-shredded carrots from the bagged salad section to save time! I think this recipe benefited from the use of better quality alfredo sauce, which I was elated to find in the freezer section of my local \"food service supplier\" (Gordon Foods), because I do not like the taste or price of jarred alfredo either! I also chopped the mushrooms rather well, supposing that the mushroom slices would interrupt the texture (and scare the kids?). It was perfect.  Easy as promised =) \n TIP #2: Top with panko crumbs and bake a few more minutes (with foil removed) to brown slightly; adds great texture and appearance.",
