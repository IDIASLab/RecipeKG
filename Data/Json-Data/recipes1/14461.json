First off, instead of steaming the broccoli in a steamer, I added it to a saute pan with a little bit of water (maybe a 1/2 cup) a tablespoon of butter and some minced garlic. When I sauteed the mushrooms, I added a little bit of fresh spinach (about 2 cups/handfuls). I also added a few pinches of Marjoram, Basil, Thyme, and parsley paste (in substitute for fresh parsley). Instead of putting the dry mustard in the dough, I added it to the cream mixture since I bought a pre-made crust. When it came time to add the egg, I added one extra to equal four. Turned out fantastic! One of the best recipes I've used from this site in a while! Enjoy",

You can change this up in lots of ways by adding different spices and cheeses, vegetables and meats like ham, proscuitto or prepared bacon. As another reviewer said, it needs a bit more salt when made without any of the meats I listed above. Overall, this is a family favorite. I recommend that you increase the ingredients for the crust by about 20% or so to make sure you have enough to fully cover the sides and the bottom of your pie plate.",

I added a bit more butter to the softened mushrooms and onion before adding the flour half and half etc. I also cut the salt a bit in both parts of the recipe and added only a dash of nutmeg and mustard. I substituted cheddar jack for the cheddar which was great. I found that flouring the hands when pressing the cheese mixture into the pie pan worked very well. Thanks again for this great recipe.

I agree with another reviewer about adding 20% more to the crust ingredients. My crust ended up really thin which wasn't bad just would have preferred slightly thicker. I loved the nutmeg in this recipe. I accidentally put in over 1/4 teaspoon and I don't recommend doing that as the nutmeg was more obvious than it should've been. I also only put in 3/4 cup of half & half as that is all I had but the moisture content was not affected. This is a very simple recipe that allows you time to do the crust while the mushrooms & onions are sauteing. I highly recommend this and will most definitely make this again.",
