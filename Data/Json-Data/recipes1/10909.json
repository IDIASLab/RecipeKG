I also only used 1/2 stick of butter instead of a whole and did not add the salt. I think next time I will add another potato and another carrot. I also ended up putting in some half and half at the end to thin it out a little. Definitely didn't need the cornstarch and milk mixture for thickening. The one thing I would like to mention is when making this soup you must make sure to turn the heat off when adding the cheese cause if you don't you run the risk of it turning out with a curdled consistency. I took some of it to my daughters today and she thought it was better than Big Boys Canadian Cheddar Cheese Soup which has always been her favorite so boy was I happy! This one is definitely a keeper!",

Instead of cooking this on the stove I threw the potatoes carrots celery and onion into the crockpot and covered them with organic chicken broth (instead of cooking them in plain water and in place of the chicken soup base) and cooked them all day. After they'd cooked I quickly ran a potato masher through them for a quick coarse texture then added the milk (condensed milk it's easier to cook with) and the Velveeta. I did not need the cornstarch as the potato soup was thick enough on it's own thanks to the Velveeta. I did add a couple personal touches (a few spices little Frank's Hot Sauce sauteed green onion and fresh minced garlic real bacon bits). I think had I not added the extras it would have turned out quite bland. The end result was a decent soup and the boys seemed to enjoy it especially my husband.",
