I don't have cream cheese so I just spread the sour cream then added homemade salsa to 1 whole wheat tortilla. I cooked some turkey bacon in the microwave. This was a super easy breakfast. I liked the suggestion of another reviewer to add an avocado. I loved walking out to my garden and picking the tomato and lettuce. I didn't do all the pre-chopping I just placed everything down on the tortilla rolled it up and cut the slices.",

Also I always put garlic powder on my BLT sandwiches so I added some garlic to to the cream cheese mix about 1/2 tsp. I didn't bother to shred the lettuce I just layered pieces of lettuce on the cream cheese mix before I rolled. These were very good. I'm sure they would have been very good without the alterations as well.",
