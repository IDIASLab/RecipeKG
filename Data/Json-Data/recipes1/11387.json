But I wanted to use up a lot of the zucchini we were given so I tried it! I used maybe 3/8 cup of onion two huge honkin' zucchini and I chopped up 8 or 9 baby carrots instead of using grated. I diced up a stalk of celery and boiled it with the other veggies (including the carrots). I used margarine instead of butter and half low-fat/half regular sour cream. I added one can of drained flaked chicken and I was really glad I did - next time I might cook and chop up a chicken breast to add to the mix. I would not want this all the time but it was a nice change in the casserole world.:) I really enjoyed the stuffing part: yummy and soggy on the bottom yummy and crunchy on top. Next time I might double the stuffing. Thanks Judy!",
