While still very good, ground turkey will leave a little bit of \"turkey\" aftertaste, so I can't wait to try them with pork! I used a bag of angel hair coleslaw mix for a cabbage short-cut and that worked very well. We boiled our dumplings in salted water for five minutes and they were fabulous--didn't need to be fried at all! (A Chinese friend of ours from Beijing introduced us to this low-fat alternative!) For a dipping sauce we used 2 T. soy sauce, 1/2 t. vinegar (rice vinegar is best but all I had was white vinegar) and a drop of sesame oil. After boiling all the dumplings we added sliced green onions to the water and served it as a light broth soup alongside the dumplings (also traditionally Chinese). Four of us easily ate all of the dumplings as the main dish. An amazing dinner!",

I meant to half the recipe but messed up on one of the ingredients and had to make them all... I don't know about this making 100 dumplings...but it sure made a lot (so much that i've individually frozen 6 dumplings worth of meat and wrappers in baggies, to be defrosted for appetizers for me and my honey)... And my boyfriend absolutely loved it..\r\n\r\nI followed the recipe with the exception of I used turkey instead of pork, and I pan fried for a couple of minutes then poured water in the pan to steam...\r\n\r\nTHIS IS A KEEPER!",

The recipe makes a lot so I usually freeze about 1/2 on a cookie sheet then throw in a freezer bag - great to make later for dinner with a nice salad.  I've both steamed in lettuce leaves and sauteed - the best method for me has been to brown in a wok type pan with cooking spray for about 3 minutes, flip them, then add about 1/3 cup of water to bottom of the pan and cover for about 15 minutes on low heat or until the water is evaporated - REALLY GOOD!  Serve with mixture of 2tbsp rice wine vinegar, 1 tbsp dark sesame oil, 2 tbsp soy sauce, and two thinly chopped scallions from previous review - Thanks for this great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "*Option for pan-fry to crisp skin starting from uncooked if you would prefer* -   Get a large deep-sided nonstick pan nice and hot with a couple TBs of oil, about mid-high heat.  Place dumplings flat-side down in pan, it's OK to crowd a little and be touching, but not overlap.  Pan-fry until that bottom is nice & crisp and then get a lid ready - add about a 1/2 cup of water to the pan and quickly cover with lid to contain the sizzling/popping from the oil.  (Yes you're adding water to hot oil) Reduce heat to mid-low and boil until all the water is gone, about 10-15 mins.  Some oil will be left on bottom once water is gone, remove lid for a couple mins and continue to cook... the skins will shrink against the filling and they'll have a crisp chewy bottom.            Lorna's original recipe here is top-notch and totally worthy of 5 star as it's written though!",
