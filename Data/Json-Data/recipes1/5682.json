When the legs came out of the final simmering pan, I wasn't happy with how soft they were. I wanted my fried chicken crispy. I took the chicken and put it in the flour and seasoning again and fried it for another 5 minutes. We loved it! I enjoyed the extra coating and was so pleased with the outcome I will surely make this again. This is great, even a novice can cook this successfully!",
