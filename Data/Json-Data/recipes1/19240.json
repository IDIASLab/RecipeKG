So, my dish is made without the butter, and it still came out well.  The mustard and pickle relish flavors r noticeable, so if u r not a fan of pickles or mustard, I suppose u could omit either or both.  Would make a more rounded meal served with a salad and bread on the side.  All in all, not disappointed here.  Also, this sort of a recipe or dish would make for a great dish to bring to a potluck.",
