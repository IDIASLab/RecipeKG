I felt the original recipe was a bit on the bland side, so I suggest using 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, 4 to 6 tablespoons of red wine vinegar (depending on taste), 2 tablepsoons of Worcesteshire, and 2 bay leaves.  The results are wonderful.  Make sure to serve the meat au jaus, as the broth is where most of the flavor resides.",

Skipped the bay leaf, eyeballed the rest of the ingredients...it was GOOD!!!! Definitely add the wine, I think that was what was lacking in some reviewers complaints, plus I really loaded up on the cracked pepper - not too much salt though. The house smells heavenly. Serving with fresh green beans and egg noodles - hope they like it!!!! EDIT...ok this is done and it is ever so tender --- remember to cut it AGAINST the grain, that is key to tender steak...and the 1/2 wine 1/2 water was spot on for taste!!!! YUMMY!!!",
