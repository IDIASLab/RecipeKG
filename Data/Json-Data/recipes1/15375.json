I used butter-flavored shortening (since I have an abundance of it) omitted the oats and replaced the self-rising flour with all-purpose flour 1/2 tsp baking powder 1/8 tsp salt. I also rolled out the dough so I could try out my new biscuit cutters. For those curious about using this recipe for cutout cookies be warned that the dough is quite crumbly so go slowly when you roll. You also might want to use shortening in this case because butter might cause spreading. Oh and reduce baking time to 7-8 minutes or so since cutout cookies are thinner than drop cookies. Regardless of how you decide to shape the dough these cookies are definitely flaky and light with a hint of sweetness. Before baking brush the tops with a bit of egg yolk for a lovely shiny golden crust. I will for sure be making these again:o) Thank you Jayna!",
