They were magnificent nonetheless.:) Here's what I did: I cut the recipe in half and cooked the 4 cabbage rolls in the slowcooker for 2.5 hours instead. I did not have chili powder at all so I just used about 2 T of taco seasoning. I doubled the garlic did not have diced tomatoes with chiles but used about half a 16 oz can of tomato sauce in the meat mixture and about half of what was left on top of the rolls. I had a few cherry tomatoes that were on their way out so I chopped them up and sprinkled them on top along with half of a small can of green chiles. My boyfriend is quite the eater but he was stuffed after just one roll/tamale for dinner. As far as the problem some have had with cabbage leaf size it's possible that US cabbages are so large where some of us are that it's not an issue at all as it wasn't for me. Just try the largest cabbage you can find.",

I chose this recipe to use when a friend offered to help me learn how to use my electric pressure cooker and it proved to be a great choice. I read online that Mexican chili powder is hotter than regular chili powder and more flavorful. I was hesitant about it being too hot so I reduced it from 3 tsp to 2 slightly rounded tsp and everyone who tasted them agreed that it was a perfect amount. Very good flavor but not \"hot.\" Mine were not the least bit dry as other reviewers commented. I should mention that my pressure cooker had a \"Meat\" setting which would only allow me to set it for up to 25 min max. That turned out to be perfect; more time was not needed. Don't know but perhaps 30 min was too long for whatever method of cooking those other reviewers used. (I would not classify these as a Mexican dish nor as tamales. Can't imagine how those terms ended up in the title. They sure are tasty though!!)",
