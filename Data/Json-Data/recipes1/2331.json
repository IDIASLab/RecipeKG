I think the muffins would come out nicer if you just add the milk to the butter mixture and then add the flour mixture all at once; the way the recipe is written, it's difficult to NOT overwork the batter. I probably won't try it again, though; it just wasn't anything exciting. Nice, predictable, okay muffins. Frankly, I liked the batter more than the muffins. And just in case you're considering it: These do NOT ship well. I baked them, let them cool, and shipped them two-day express all in the same day, and they were rancid when they arrived.",
