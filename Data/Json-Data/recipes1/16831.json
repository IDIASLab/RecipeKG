Forgetting that a box of bow-tie pasta can feed a small army, I used an entire box.  I think it would have been better if I only used half.  Overall, I think the dish was quite boring.  Perhaps if I had some wine to saute the veggies in or if I added a light tomato sauce.. but I don't think I'll be trying this again, too boring.",
