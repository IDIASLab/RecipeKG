It didn't make a bit of difference to the recipe at all other than making it moister.) I added a healthy splash of vanilla extract and I used Hershey's cinnamon chips instead of Hershey's chocolate chips only because that was what I had on hand. This recipe did NOT make 24 servings. I was able to get 12 muffins out of one recipe and they were a little on the small side. 350 for 20 minutes and they were ready to go. I think the sugar could be cut back a bit. When using the glaze it made the bread a tad too sweet. I'll cut back on the sugar in the bread next time. I would double the spices but using the glaze it makes it right where it should be. Just beware that this recipe does NOT make the quantity it states if you're depending on those 12 extra servings. EDITED: This bread turned out so dry. Good the first hour it came out of the oven then it dries out fast. The next day it was inedible. If I were to make this again I'd add at least another cup of pumpkin. I'm sorry. I thought this was a good recipe it just wasn't.",
