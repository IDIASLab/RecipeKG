Thinking it was a fluke, I tried it again, preparing it myself - and still hated it.  So I knew I wouldn\u2019t like the broccoli rabe in this recipe, but I also knew I\u2019d love the recipe itself prepared with broccolini as an alternative.  It was wonderful.  Hubs and I both enjoyed it. Festive with its bright green and red colors, it was perfect for a Christmas season meal.  I served it with a beautiful prime rib roast that Hubs prepared along with \u201cShiitake Scallopine,\u201d recipe also from this site.",

I added a little fresh olive oil red wine vinegar and some calamata olives and had it salad style. Delish!",
