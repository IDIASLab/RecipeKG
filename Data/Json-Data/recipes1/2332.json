The only way I know of to get a meringue on top of a pie is to bake it on, but the recipe says nothing about this, and when I did the fudge part liquified underneath the meringue. I put it in the refrigerator hoping it would solidify, and the meringue detatched from the crust and began floating. After a day in the fridge, the filling is still pretty runny. The whole mess tastes great, but the presentation leaves something to be desired.",

I need to add more flour or starch, or just continue to freeze it. It was a hit on Thanksgiving, despite the problem. I had used an oreo cookie crust, and we put servings in cups with whipped cream - it was no longer a pie, but it tasted great!",

When using cornstarch you need only bring to a boil & boil gently for 1 full minute. Longer than that filling will go back to thin. When using flour after coming to a boil it really needs a gentle boil for at least 4 min. to make sure there isn't a uncooked taste. Something I do makes for a smooth filling. I put all ingredients in a blender & blend till smooth than cook. This way there is absolutely no pieces of cooked egg. I omit the egg tempering stage by putting ingredients in the blender.

THen when you apply the meringue and DONT BAKE IT it becomes a sloppy drippy sticky nasty mess. Who doesn't bake a pie after you add the meringue? I had doubts about this recipe buy my rule is you make every recipe exactly at least once and THEN you can start making changes. THe recipe says TOP WITH THE MERINGUE OF YOUR CHOICE. Nothing about baking the pie after that. It was a disaster for the 12 people I had for dinner. The only reason I gave it any starts is because the flavor of the filling is decadent but this recipe needs LOTS of work.",
