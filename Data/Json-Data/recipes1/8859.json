The salad it topped was comprised of mixed greens navel orange sections julienned jicama and toasted pumpkin seeds yummy! Couldn't afford the 40 yr old sherry vinegar but I'm sure it would be fabulous with it. After I refrigerated it overnight I did feel it needed the Dijon mustard for kick so I added 2 tsp and that was just enough. Thank you Marbalet for sharing your recipe!",
