Everyone was chowing down. They are also good for leftovers, I had them for lunch today! Thanks for the great recipe!",

My husband loved them as he is a big fan of scalloped potatoes and this version is much easier than making the cream sauce by hand and then adding the cheese. I halved the recipe and used 1/2 colby-jack 1/2 processed cheese and added flour to the milk before pouring it into the dish and it was yummy. I also added a little paprika with the salt and pepper for each layer. It won't have the same smooth texture as it does if you make the sauce separate from scratch but the key is to keep stirring this as it bakes. I also have a mandolin so slicing the potatoes is a snap and it didn't take me long to put this together. Great time saving recipe if you are craving home made scalloped potatoes.",
