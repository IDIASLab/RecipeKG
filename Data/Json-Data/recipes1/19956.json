The purple potatoes turn everything purple/blue within minutes. 3 TBSP. of mayo was not even close to coating the potatoes and 2 bunches of radishes. That's okay though because the mayo didn't really yield enough flavor. This would have been far better with some type of vinegar dressing. Zesty Italian would have perfect I think. You'd still have the problem of the potatoes turning everything purple but the flavor would have been there at least. I also think one bunch of radishes would have been plenty. I made as written but would not make again as so. This recipe was fun due to the colors but it needs some tweaks. If you make as written I highly recommend adding some fresh herbs.",
