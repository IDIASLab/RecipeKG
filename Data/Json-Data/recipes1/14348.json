I made some additional \"crust\" to press into the sides when the cheesecake was finished.  I also cooked the crust for 10 minutes at 325 and let it cool completely before adding the cream cheese/pumkin mixture.  Whenever doing a cheesecake - do a waterbath.  I cooked this cheesecake in a waterbath at 325 for one hour, turned the oven off and left it in there for one hour.  I then chilled it overnight.  Then proceeded with the maple pecan glaze.  No cracks, and it was completely done and very, very rich.",

Add a teaspoon of corn starch to the dry ingredients and it doesn't even crack! I had no problems making or adding the topping either and it was absolutely necessary for the taste!! This was the first cheesecake I've ever made myself and it just went so well! So good I'm making two for Christmas!!",
