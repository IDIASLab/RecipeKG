                "reviewBody": "8.23.21 First, let me say that this chicken tastes nothing at all like Chick-fil-A\u00ae and IMO, has MANY issues.  Two teaspoons each cayenne and crushed red pepper flakes for two servings would make this inedible for most people.  Why does it have seasoning salt, garlic salt, and salt making it a sodium nightmare?  If you cooked chicken tenders for 20 minutes over medium-high heat, the chicken would turn into a cinder. I couldn\u2019t taste even a hint of honey mustard, this tasted just like I\u2019d breaded a piece of chicken and fried it.   A nutritional splurge is OK occasionally, but this recipe is simply unhealthy in every respect, and just not worth it.  Sorry for the bad first review, and I don\u2019t want to discourage others from trying it, but reviews need to be honest, and this just didn't work for us.  I'm giving it 2 stars because we ate it, but needless to say, I will not be making this again.",

                "reviewBody": "Since my chicken seasoning blend has cayenne, I eliminated the extra cayenne and red pepper flakes, which would have made it WAY too spicy. Flavor with this change was great. I've never been to Chick-Fil-It so cannot compare. Breading proportions are way off - recipe calls for 8 oz chicken but there was enough of the egg mixture for 21 oz, which fit perfectly in my 12\" pan. I halved the flour and breadcrumbs, and just needed an extra tablespoon of breadcrumbs to make this work for the extra chicken. Since I have a non stick pan, I was able to reduce the oil to 2 T. If doing this, I recommend cooking at Medium, as the crust is so thick it takes a while for the chicken to cook through, and the crust would burn on medium high. Hubby liked it. Will make again.",
