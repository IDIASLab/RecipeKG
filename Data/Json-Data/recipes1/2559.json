For those of you who buy the extra large jars, the measurement for an 18 ounce jar of peanut butter is \"1 7/8\" cups (just measure two cups and subtract 2 tablespoons). I just use the entire two cups instead. The recipe is \"forgiving\" with regards to the quantity of peanut butter...give or take a few tablespoons (in my book, more is better)and they always come out delicious!!! DO NOT OVERBAKE! DO NOT WAIT FOR THE EDGES TO BROWN!! Take them out once they no longer look wet and leave on cookie sheet for at least ten minutes. TY Kevin for the recipe!!!!",

I must have a different concept of \"chewy\" than the author because although I would say they were moist they certainly weren't chewy. The dough was very crumbly and the finished product was the same. It sort of disintigrated in your mouth - almost reminded me of a super moist shortbread if that makes any sense. Obviously with a whole jar it had good pb flavor but the texture was definitely lacking. Forgettable recipe. I continue my search for the ultimate pb cookie.
