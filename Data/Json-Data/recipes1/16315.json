WILL make again and next time will try and make my own marinara cuz from what every1 else sed on here its makes it better.. which theyre already awesome. but i bet a homemade marinara would be EVEN better!! probly more for an appetizer or for a party or event but every1 including picky children all loved. and so did i! once again (second time updated) very delicious! this time i used frozen spinach thawed and drained; basmati rice only chicken broth (replaced wine) and used cream cheese instead of mozz cubes (based on ingredients on hand). still hafta rate it 5.. love these! once again so does everyone else. still wasnt able to make the marinara but theyre GRRREAT w/o. there are leftovers though (since i doubled recipe for thxgiving) and thinking about making marinara later today. will update again!",

Also I don't know where the \"ready in 1 hour 30 minutes\" claim came from. I have to refrigerate the rice mixture for that long alone and then give the balls another 30 minutes in the fridge before frying. It's more of a three-hour ordeal and while I don't mind spending that much time preparing something delicious it's maddening to waste a good chunk of my day making something flavorless and disappointing. The only reason this got 2 stars instead of 1 is because the risotto was delicious. I'll definitely make the risotto again but skip all the breading and frying.",
