We really like tomatoes so I drained the can of diced tomatoes and did not use the juice. I felt like maybe the juice would overpower the chicken taste. We enjoyed it this way very much. The other thing I did different was to add another 1/2 - 1 Cup of chicken broth JUST BEFORE serving to get the \"stew consistency\" I wanted. It was a little too thick without. Probably because in part due to not using the tomato juice. I did not serve over rice very yummy without.",
