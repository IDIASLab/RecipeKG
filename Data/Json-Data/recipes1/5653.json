You're able to cut professional looking 2\" dough squares and the finished product has that \"flakey\" quality you can't achieve with the dinner roll dough. Since the dough \"puffs\" up when baked add alot of crabmeat mixture to each square. Used \"Pam\" to coat the baking sheet and reduced temperature to 375 F in a convection oven to prevent any burning. Worked great. An excellent appeetizer.",
