I used half a green cabbage, half a butternut squash, 2 carrots, 2 parsnips, and half a rutabaga. It was fairly easy (a lot of chopping, but still fairly easy), but took way more time to bake than listed. I also had so many veggies that I had to use 2 separate sheet pans to fit it all. I simply tossed everything with oil, seasoned with the salt and pepper and herbs de Provence (just eyeballed the amounts), then crumbled the sausage over the top of everything. Each pan needed at least 45 minutes to bake, and I stirred the veggies twice while baking. I really appreciate that this actually made a ton of leftovers to use for lunches, and another dinner too. It's really really delicious as well. Thank you for the recipe!",
