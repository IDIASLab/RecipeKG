It is excellent, and I love how you can turn up/down the heat factor with the amount of chipotle peppers you add.  I love spicy food, so I always add extra, but for those who don't do spicy like that, you can decrease what you add without compromsing the flavor.  The pumpkin adds such a great counter to the chipotle.  I have played around with the recipe the last two times I made it, and I've found that making a roux first helps with a thick sauce.  I saute the onions and garlic in butter (maybe about 1/4 cup) and then add flour to make a thick paste.  I then continue on with the recipe by adding the chicken broth, etc.  Great recipe either way!",

This has a big (and YUMMY) kick but if you don't handle spicy well you could half the chipotle. Also if you wanted some protein this would pair well with chicken. Great for a fall twist on pumpkin but I will be making this year round!",

I started making this before realizing I didn't have any sage or coriander so I just used Italian blend instead. I served it over whole wheat penne.
