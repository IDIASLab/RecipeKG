After baking my potatoes and scooping out the pulp I mashed the pulp then added 4 TB. butter and the amount of sour cream called for. I added salt and pepper to my taste which really helped the flavor. I then added two cans of the drained corn and one can of the chilies. I did divide the filling and used cheddar in half of the filling for my kids and pepper jack for my husband and me in the other half. Then I baked as directed pulled them out topped with more cheese baked 5 more minutes and served. YUM!! I will keep on making this recipe with the changes stated. Oh I did have some filling leftover and may only use one can of the corn next time.",

Very veggie but the potato flavor came through just wonderfully. I baked the potatoes in the microwave. They came out fine but I scraped the pulp out a little too close to the skins and my skins sort of lost their shape. I piled the mixture into them and rewrapped the skins around them. Not a beautiful presentation but tasty anyway. Don't understand these people who are afraid to use pepperjack cheese. It only has a little hint of a spicy pepper here and there scattered among the ordinary jack cheese flavor. I could have had it even a little spicer and I'm not a big hot stuff fan. In addition to the sour cream I think I'll make them again with butter too. I liked them a lot but hubby had no comment- not a good sign. Oh well maybe my presentation next time will appeal to him more. Maybe a little paprika sprinkled on top for color--even with the browning they still seemed a little pale and lifeless looking despite all the goodies awaiting inside every bite.",
