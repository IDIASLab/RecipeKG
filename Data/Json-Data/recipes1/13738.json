I used napa cabbage frozen tiny steamed shrimp (canned is yuckky) and matchstick carrots. I also added shredded poached chicken breast matchstick red peppers and cilantro. I didn't measure these but just threw in what I had -- that's the beauty of these: experiment! For dipping sauce I used hoisin sauce Thai sweet chili sauce and a soy/ginger sauce. The recipe made almost 50 spring rolls and they disappeared from the platter in less than 10 minutes at my brother's wedding reception! By the way I made these the night before laying them on a platter scattered with shredded napa cabbage. I covered them with damp paper towels and then shrouded the whole thing with foil. They were PERFECT the next day!",
