However, there were several factors that earned the recipe an overall 5 star rating.  1)  My kids liked them and they were a big hit with the kids at a play group I hosted.  2)  I like that there is so much calcium packed into these muffins.  3)  They are so quick and easy to make.  I will definitely make again, but next time, will double the mini chips and sprinkle some cinnamon sugar on top.  I would encourage people not to be discouraged by negative reviews.  Try this recipe!  Just increase the sugar or the chips - all it needs is a bit more sweetness.",

I modified the recipe to make it a bit healthier and they still turned out great! I used 1 egg and 2 egg whites, 1 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cups white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat (just so they wouldn't be dense, but you could probably do 1/2 and 1/2), 2 TBL flax seed or wheat germ, skim milk, 2 tsp. baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and 1 1/2 tsp salt (because I didn't have self-rising flour!). 1 1/2 tsp baking soda per every cup of flour is a bit much for this recipe. You can really taste it! It made 24 mini muffins and 4 big-regular muffins. My kids love them, and I feel good about making them! ",
