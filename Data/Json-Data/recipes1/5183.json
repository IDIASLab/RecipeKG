I usually make about 40 lbs at a time though!!(around 150-170 wings) Also,I added the fresh ground ginger root for a bit of a snap.This feeds around 80-100 people given that we also do lobster tails,scallops in bacon and many different salads. Anyway,for 3 lbs...\n\nIn a bowl,combine:\n\n1Tbsp salt\n3 Tbsps sugar\n1/2 tsp ground ginger (or more,to taste)\n1 tsp fresh ground ginger root\n6 Tbsps HOT water (to dissolve)\n6 Tbsps good soy sauce (check Asian markets for the good stuff!!) Kikkoman works\n2 Tbsps Tanguerey gin.\n\nStir until salt and sugar are dissolved.\n place around 16 wings in a 1 gallon ziplock bag.Pour in the marinade. before closing,remove all air possible!!\n\nMarinate a minumum of 24 hours,the longer the better,turning every few hours.(I do a minumum of 36)\n\nDeep fry (sorry grease haters,but it's WAY faster) at 375% for 5-6 minutes,or until deep golden brown\n\nTurn out onto paper towels,dab off grease and keep warm in a 200% oven until ready to serve",
