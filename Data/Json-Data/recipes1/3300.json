This is the best tasting zucchini bread I had ever had.  The crushed pineapple really helps in making this bread really moist.  This bread is also good with 1/2 cup grated carrots (for color) and some chopped walnuts.  Buy extra zucchini, grate all the zucchini, and freeze pre-measured in 2 cup quantities.  It freezes really well and you will always have zucchini on hand to make this bread.",

Added nuts, and did have to double up on the spices since this does make two loaves.  Replaced half the oil with applesauce.  Sweet and moist and flavorfull w/changes.  Also added half tsp. cardamom.  This made 1 8 in loaf and 2 small mini loaves so not sure if making 2 8 in. loaves they would be more on the flat side.",

I also made this with 1 cup of applesauce in place of the oil.  I made it with unsweetened applesauce and the bread was VERY sweet.  I definitely would not want any more sweetness so I strongly recommend using unsweetened applesauce.  One more caution is that this does not seem to keep well at room temperature.  After the 2nd day it turned slimy and didn't taste as good, so I would say either eat it up by the 2nd day or keep it in the fridge.  It definitely tasted best on the first day.  I'm also going to add some nuts next time.",

I decreased the sugar to a little less than 1.25 cups and will decrease it to 1 cup next time I make it.  It's quite sweet and being diabetic it is too much for me.  I think 1 cup of sugar would be adequate as the pineapple adds a sweeter flavor as well.  \r\n\r\nGenerally, I liked it very much and it will go onto my Favorites list.  I gave it 4 stars only because of the sugar content.  It could be a little less.\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing this recipe, Michele.  It's delicious.",
