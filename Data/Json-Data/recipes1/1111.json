I find using a fork THROUGHOUT the blending steps really helps. Tip for anyone making cookies: ALWAYS UNDERBAKE COOKIES! Practically everyone prefers a soft tender cookie over a hard one. Even if you pull them out and they look really soft in the middle its okay. As long as the edges are \"set\" they'll be perfect once cooled.",
