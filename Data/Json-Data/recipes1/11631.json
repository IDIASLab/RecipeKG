To take away the strong fishy taste, soak the fish in milk for several hours before cooking or, if you plan on freezing the fish, fill a ziplock bag with half water and half milk and freeze.

We simply skinned the filet marinated in Wishbone Italian for maybe one hour then grilled in the Weber kettle for maybe 20 minutes. Also sauteed some trimmings. All were superb!
