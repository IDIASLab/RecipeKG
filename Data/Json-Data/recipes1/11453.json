The caramel that is called for in this recipe with the brown sugar condensed milk and Karo syrup is quite versatile and can be used for other caramel needs. I only made half the recipe and it chilled quickly and was delicious. The only thing I would recommend is cutting the caramel by 1/4 because what happens is that it overpowers the pie crust and the chocolate topping. Also instead of using a regular pie crust I made a chocolate cookie crust. Yum!",

They were fabulous but very rich for our family's tastes--and we are rather hearty eaters of sweets. My only complaints are that it is time-consuming (to wait for it to cool) and that it does get gooey with only minimal time at room temperature. But I really can't say enough nice things about this recipe--it was so fabulous and exotic flavored and yet a 13 year old was able to do it with no trouble. Bravo to this recipe!",

I really like the idea of a \"turtle cream\" pie and next time I will probably half ALL of the ingredients (except for pecans/shell) and put at least 8 oz. of whip cream (enough to fill out the pie crust) on top. I also decorated with pecans dipped in caramel chopped chocolate chips with shavings etc and drizzled caramel. I would not use a graham cracker crust or cookie crust as someone recommended as it is already really rich (sweet).",
