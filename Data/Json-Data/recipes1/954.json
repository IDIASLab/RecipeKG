Slowly add the sweet condensed milk and whip until completely smooth.  Then continue with the recipe.  I will definitely use two bricks of cream cheese and use a 12 oz container of cool whip instead of the 16 oz.  Cutting down on the cool whip and adding the cream cheese will give it a more \"homemade - less plasticy\" flavor.  I would also suggest adding the lemon zest of the lemon. UPDATE: Although I thought this deserved 3 stars, I did take two of these pies to a party and EVERYBODY LOVED them.  I used the no roll crust recipe from this site and people thought is was a special macademia nut crust! ",

I also left out the lemon because my husband is not a big fan of sour things. I will definitely make this again. Also I did not freeze it.
