I followed other reviewers' advice and doubled the pumpkin adjusting the cooking time accordingly. I also used freshly baked pumpkin instead of canned. (Slice wedges and bake for at least an hour or until soft. Puree with a hand mixer) This freezes well in individual portions and reheats well. Wrap one piece in a paper towel and pop it in the microwave for half a minute. Yummy!",

I added sliced almonds to the first batch and chopped pecans to the second.

I also added 1 tsp. vanilla to the second batch.  Both batches were great!  Pumpkin doesn't have much flavor, so it's all in the spices!",

However I enjoy reading about what changes other cooks have made it gives me inspiration. If you don't agree you may want to stop reading now (no hard feelings I swear). I substituted half of the white flour with wheat flour. I used about 1 and 1/3 cups of real pumpkin puree substituted 2/3's of a cup of Agave Nectar in place of the 1 cup of brown sugar and used 2 tsps of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices. I made buttermilk from 1% milk by adding one half a tbsp of white vinegar to the 1/2 cup of milk stirred and let sit for five minutes. I baked the bread in muffin tins at 325 for 25 minutes. Yes the five stars are based on my version but I have no doubt the original recipe was just as yummy and by making these simple changes the calorie count was further reduced to about 110 calories per serving.",
