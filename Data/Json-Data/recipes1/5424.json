What is best is that it is SO SIMPLE! You can literally whip it up in no time. I used home made whipped topping (heavy whipping cream with a touch of sugar and vanilla) and spread it over the entire pie. I made this for my husbands birthday dinner party. I have since made this pie 3 more times. Everytime we are invited to dinner friends ask me to make this pie for them, it is PERFECT!

They were dense and heavy, more like a custard than anything, with a bitter lime taste. Then I went in search of a lighter recipe, one without the eggs. This was the recipe I was looking for!! Light, creamy, not too tart or too sweet! PERFECT! I didn't stick with the key limes, (I found the key lime juice to be terribly acidic when I used it in the first recipe) instead I used about 8 Mexican limes that I found in my grocery produce section. They're a little smaller than the traditional Perisian limes, but a bit bigger than the Key Limes. They worked wonderfully! I ended up with 2 cups of juice and used it all for two pies. I used 4 cans of condensed milk, and baked for closer to 13 minutes in shortbread crusts. Topped with homemade whipped cream and YUMMO! Everyone freaked over this pie! I will use this recipe forever! Thanks so much for sharing it!",

Really took a matter of minutes, longest part was breaking up the cookies in the blender. I also used Rose's Key Lime juice. EDITED: I liked the combination of the oatmeal cookie crust with the pie filling, I just found the pie a little sweet. I think if I make a key lime pie again, I'll look for one that's creamier and less sweet. EDITED AGAIN: This was even better the next day. I LOVED this pie. EDITED AGAIN: I have doubled the recipe for this and used a homemade graham crust or a pretzel crust and it's always turned out fantastic. This dessert is always a homerun, I've never had leftovers when I make this pie for a gathering or potluck.",

I made two Key Lime pies, one with egg whites folded in and this recipe. This one stole the show. It was prettier and creamier. I added about 1 1/2 ounce of lime jello for color and flavor but I heard that a true key lime does not have green coloring. I found the key lime juice in the juice section at one grocery store and the liquor section at another. I cannot imagine someone squeezing 20 key limes!
