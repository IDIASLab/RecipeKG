I used 1 jar of home canned apples and made it into \"apple pie filling\" by following the recipe called Apple Pie Filling (skipped cooking the apples as mine were already cooked). This made enough filling for TWO cheesecakes. I also made my own graham cracker crust and added chopped pecans to the crust.  It was an easy recipe to follow. If followed exactly, it will not fail! The pecans in the crust AND mixed into the caramel topping were the two things I added that made this even more outstanding than as written! Seriously, use pecans!! The best part is this cheesecake doesn't have to set overnight! It was ready to eat 2 hours after coming out of the oven. 1 hr to cool to room temperature, add topping, cool in fridge 1 more hour, DONE.",

They said it was better than restaurant quality and I would have to agree.  The recipe and the tips were easy to follow.  The 2 comments or instructions I would add : Do not use a mixer when mixing the cream cheese mixture it starts to curdle; we stopped the mixer and used a whisk which did break down most of the curdles and smoothed out the mixture. We also placed a glass dish with 2 inches of water in the rack underneath the cheesecake when it was in the oven to keep the cheesecake top from cracking which I lis a technique that came from cooks country. This cheesecake is a winner and a keeper!",
