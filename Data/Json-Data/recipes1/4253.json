I gave it two stars because I was able to add some things to it (a dash of worcestershire sauce some onion powder garlic powder more bullion and a LOT more salt) to make it bearable. However we spent the entire meal trying to figure out what would make it better. We'd have an idea then dismiss it. We finally decided that perhaps some cheese would make it better though we don't have any in the house. When I finally succumb to starvation and have to eat some more I'm going to try adding curry powder and see how that goes.",
