I skipped the scalloped potatoes entirely and used remaining stuffing in it's place (I used only two chicken breasts). I used Mrs. Cubbinson's Cornbread Stuffing adding sauteed onion and celery. While the chicken was baking I reduced 1/3 c. plum jam and 1/3 c. water and glazed the chicken with it about 35 minutes into baking (I baked for 40 min.) This created a nice sweet/savory flavor. The chicken was very tender and juicy. Thanks Helen!",
