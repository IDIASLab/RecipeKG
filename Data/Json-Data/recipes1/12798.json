A tip for the leftovers (because everyone else was right, this does make a lot!)... This recipie is essentialy a truffle recipie.  Let the leftovers cool and then refrigerate.  Round out small balls and roll in cocoa powder, powdered sugar or toadsted coconut. All of a sudden you have a new, gormet desert you can serve all over again and impress the crowds! Truffles also make great gifts when wrapped nicely!",

I don't own a fondue pot, so I made it in a double boiler (without the water) and transferred it to a pretty chafing dish. This was so delicious, Sara. My company thoroughly enjoyed it with a variety of fresh fruit and pound cake. Try the Apricot Brandy Pound Cake (quick version made with Yellow cake mix) from this site. It freezes well and can be cut into cubes easily. I also had some chocolate pound cake from this site in the freezer. I had some 5 inch bamboo skewers left from another recipe that I gave each guest. They were happily threading the skewers with a variety of items, and wondering when I had had the time to prepare such a luscious dessert. They said the fondue was as good if not better than that at a local fondue restaurant. I will use this again and again.",

But, even after a party, I had at least 1 1/2 cups of chocolate left over.  So, here's my idea for WHAT TO DO WITH THE LEFTOVER CHOCOLATE:  reheat in the microwave, until melted; stir in walnuts.  I used about 1 cup, but you can adjust it to your preference.  Spray a rectangular glass pan (mine is a 6x9\") with Pam, or line with wax paper, then pour the mix in.  Layer tiny marshmallows, cut-up leftover marshmallows, or mashmallow fluff over the top.  Cool, then refridgerate until relatively solid (overnight).  Cut into squares, wrap individually with clear plastic wrap and VOILA!  Homemade Rocky Road Fudge.  It will be soft at room temp, so you might want to keep the fudge in the fridge or freezer.   Makes a nice treat.",
