                "reviewBody": "Thank you for this recipe!! These were definitely the BEST gluten-free & egg-free cookie I have made. However I will make some changes next time I make them. First I will add probably a 1/2 to a full cup more of the baking mix (without doing this the cookies came out more like lace cookies) and I will either cut back on the salt or baking soda (they were a little salty for our taste.) I used gluten-free dairy-free chips and cut the sugar back to 1 c. of brown sugar only. I think with more sugar they would've been WAY too sweet. My whole family loves them. The bigger the spoonful the better the cookie. Since writing the previous rating I have tinkered with this recipe and have come up with the following changes: add 1/2 c. Teff flour to the dry ingredients use only 1/2 t. salt 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar. I use about 1/2 bag of \"Enjoy Life\" chocolate chips. I scoop out about a 2\" ball and flatten it before baking. Super yummy!!",

                "reviewBody": "OK I read many many reviews on this recipe, since I've been on a quest for the perfect GF choc chip cookie recipe for a while now.  The search is over- this recipe really is that much better than the others!  The cookies are soft/chewy on the inside and crisp on the edges- seriously perfect, and I bake a LOT so I'm tough to please.  Here's what I'd recommend on the tweaks, based on the other reviews and my experience:  I cut the brown sugar by 1/4 cup, NOT the white sugar, since white sugar adds the crispiness.  I think even with the full amount of sugar it would be fine.  I used 1.5 eggs, although if you use 2 eggs just up the flour a bit more.  I used 2 3/4 cup GF flour (used Bob's GF flour, which also requires 3/4 tsp xanthan gum be added).  Cut the salt in half (1/2 tsp) or leave it out if your baking mix has salt in it.  Definitely SIFT the dry ingredients as recommended since this makes the cookies softer and minimizes the graininess.  If your cookies spread too much, add more flour to stiffen the dough.  With the proportions above, I had a totally normal consistency dough.  I dropped them onto the cookie sheet and pressed them a bit since the cookies didn't spread on their own.  Finally, bake them til the edges/tips are slightly browned.  This recipe makes a large-ish batch but I'm so glad I doubled it because these cookies ROCK!",
