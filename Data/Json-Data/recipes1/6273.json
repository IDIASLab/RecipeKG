This was like tabouleh with out the bulgar wheat.  I used an orange bell pepper instead of green, and green onions instead of regular onion, rather than vinegar, I used lemon juice. I used some Cavenders seasoning instead of salt, it's a greek seasoning salt.  I only used one garlic clove and mixed it in a small container with the oil and lemon juice and seasoning. I let it sit in it's own juices and chill for about an hour before serving.    Wow, the flavors really popped!   The only thing we would do different next time, or when using the leftovers, add some feta cheese.  Great for lunch the next day! We will definately make this one again.  This is our new summer favorite!",
