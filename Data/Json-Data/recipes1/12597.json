I was impatient about waiting for the whipped topping to thaw so I have some teeny bumps of it in my pie (which is okay). We had it as is last night for dessert (with some candied limes and mint). Tonight I'm going to freeze it for a while to see how it is frozen - fabulous I'm sure. Thanks for this recipe I'll make it again. LATER: Even better frozen - doesn't really \"freeze \" but sets up nicer. The crust gets a little too hard though. Change up the crust a bit if you want to serve it frozen...excellent!",
