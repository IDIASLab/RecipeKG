I added 1 tsp. of sriracha and thank God I listened to my husband for not adding more otherwise it would've been too hot for us. Also I didn't have any cabbage and felt lazy to go to the grocery store so used Romaine lettuce instead. It was actually pretty good but I am convinced that using cabbage (red or green) would've been a better choice. Also substituted sunflower seeds for corn nuts. Can't wait to make this again.
