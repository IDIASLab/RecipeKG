I made the recipe as is, except I used a can of whip cream and not Cool Whip. I don't like the texture of Cool Whip and let's be honest...its just oil! One full 7oz. can of whip cream is enough, I also added walnuts to the mix. It came out a beautiful pink color and you could see the beauty of oranges and cherries peeking through. I made it before work and after a long day I looked forward to my time alone...hmmmm!! I will use this recipe for an upcoming potluck and every chance I get at home : )",
