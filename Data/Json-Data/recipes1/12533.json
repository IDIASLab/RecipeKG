Secondly, it tells you to mash the sweet potatoes, so you assume it means to cook them before mixing them with the other ingredients.  Thirdly, it tells you to cook the casserole until the potatoes are tender.  Needs to be clarified.  I cooked the potatoes first, then mashed them.  I also had to add some time to the cooking, add at least 20 minutes to the cooking time.",

I also used 3/4 cup crushed corn flakes in the potatoe mixture for a total of 1 1/2 cups crushed flakes. I used a 29 oz. can cut up sweet potatoes witch mashes to approximatly 2 cups. Next time I'll try only 1/2 cup sugar if not any as I felt this didn't need sugar. GR8 recipe! THANKS!",

I only used 1 Cup white sugar 1/2 cup margarine in both places It turned out great. I made it for my hubbys employee Thanks Giving work lunch and none came home with him. I also used canned yams for I already had them. That was the main reason I cut back on sugar for it has sugar in them. If I would of use Fresh sweet potatoe I would of needed the extra sugar I'm sure. I did drain all juices off my canned yam before using them. Would make again for sure and thank you for sharing your recipe hun 0( _ )0 Tonya",
