I added 2 tbsp. each of brown sugar and rice wine vinegar along with 1/4 tsp. of ground ginger.  I let this marinate for a full 24 hours.  With marinades, the longer the better some times.  I kept the basting sauce the same (didn't double) and used 3 Tbsp. of brown sugar.  It thickened up nicely.  I skewered the pork sepapate from the veggies and pineapple as they cook at different rates.  This went great with \"Sesame Noodles\" from this site.",

Double the marinade and marinate the vegetables also 2. Make the skewers vegetable-only and meat-only. This helps with safe and even grilling. 3. I think that the marinade is still good if you reduce some of the oil (too greasy) and replace that liquid with rice vinegar. \nThis is a great keeper, though! They smell and look delicious, and they reheat beautifully. I use chunk pineapple in the can (though I am sure fresh would be yummier), tomatoes, red onion, bell pepper, and portabella. Everyone enjoyed on rice. Thanks!",

If you don't like spice, I'd cut back on the red pepper in the marinade.  Also, the sauce was really salty when I first tasted it.  I was expecting it to be sweeter since it is called teriyaki.  I added more brown sugar until I got the flavor I wanted.",

The sauce was a little bland and I had just enough sauce to cover the kabobs with nothing left to baste them with which was ok because it was already seasoned with marinade. Most of the sauce cooked off leaving moist kabobs lightly flavored. I broiled the skewers in the oven and microwaved red potatoes both were done in just 10 minutes.",

The marinade and sauce were perfect.The only thing I changed was instead of using red onions I used green bell peppers(don't care a whole lot for onions). They were beautiful and scrumptous.
