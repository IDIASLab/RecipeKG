Oddly, the taste reminded me of a hamburger--when you get down to that last bite and there's nothing left but bun and condiments. The water chestnuts and sweet pickles made the salad. Instead of mayo, I blended an avocado with 4 tsp of balsamic vinegar and 3 sundried tomatoes (I discovered on accident that this strange combo actually tastes quite a bit like mayo, and the creamy texture is a perfect substitute). Next time, I'll cut back on the tomato so the flavor of the peas comes through more, use more pickle, and omit the onion (personal preference--I don't like raw onion, so I used green onion, which I can tolerate because it's milder, but the flavor was still too oniony for my taste). It wasn't quite as good the next day, though--the peas got mushy.",

And when I thought I had sweet pickles on hand...I didn't and had no choice but to grab for the relish I measured out 2 TBSPs of Sweet Pickle Relish to start with and added one more after tasting it. The lightness of this dish was really well balanced and wasn't at all heavy weighted with the cheese in the \"normal\" Pea Salads. I will totally make again because I was double and triple dipping my spoon in and munching while making Easter dinner. Thanks...I truely enjoyed this.",
