I made a few subs based on what I had on hand (ie: 12oz tri-color rotini, 24oz jar spaghetti sauce) and I added some chopped onion and garlic powder to the meat, and it came out fine.  Maybe a little dry, but still good.  Perhaps next time I'll cover with foil for 15-20 minutes, then uncover for the last few minutes.  I think I'll make it again!  Oh - I also recommend spraying the baking dish with non-stick spray to ease clean up.",
