When it began to scorch on the bottom of the pan (I had it over low heat) I removed it from the stove. The thickness of it made it very difficult to distribute evenly through the toasted oat mixture. When that was finally accomplished I pressed it into the pan and let it cool. It crumbled apart when I tried to cut it into bars so now I have a very tasty granola. Not exactly what I had hoped for. I may try this again with coconut oil instead of coconut butter to see if that improves things. I give it 3 stars for flavor.",
