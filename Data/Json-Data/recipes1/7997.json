This came out VERY VERY VERY greasy and was not the prettiest dish I've ever made. It was more of a \"oatmeal\" looking dish with meatballs and a lot of grease on it. My DH described it as greasy groul...which sounds just bad LOL!!! My best friend who was here to eat with us tonight thought the flavor was good but the grease had to go...with a few changes this could be a good dish! Also I'd use about 1/2 the box of the pasta the next time..it made our soup TOO thick! Thanks anyway Kelly I'm going to try to make a few changes the next time!",

I put in a can of diced tomato and a small can of green chiles because it seemed to plain otherwise but we were amazed by how delicious it was and we'll definitely be making this again.
