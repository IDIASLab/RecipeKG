I omitted the cocoa powder and used plain M&Ms instead of peanut butter ones. The batter was too runny and the batter spread in the oven. I tried adding more flour and after trying to cook one cookie it still ran. I saved the dough - and I plan to add even more flour. I think there may be too much butter and maybe 1 egg is better than 2. So don't make my mistake of changing the recipe.",
