Her recipe varies slightly - 1/2 c. of the milk with the carmels will make it smoother,  she always used German Chocolate cake mix (the best), 3/4 c. of butter and only 1/3 c. of milk in the mix, and 1cup walnuts instead of pecans. Fantastic! I tried it with yellow cake mix and that was really good too.",

It is more like eating a piece of chocolate cake with caramel, choc chips and pecans in the middle. They are moist and delicious. However, if you're looking for a fudgey-type brownie, this wouldn't be it. This is definitely a cake-type brownie, but just follow the instructions and you will have a tasty treat. I toasted the pecans, chopped them finely and added them to the caramel/chip mixture. Thanks Jessi.",
