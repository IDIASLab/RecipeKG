Also I mixed with my cuisenart and the cherries got totally pulverized so when I make it again (I will make it again) I might throw in some dried cherries so we can get those bursts of cherry flavor.

The bread came out exceedingly dense; it felt like a brick when it came out of the pan. But even worse--it did not bake all the way through. The flavor was ok not as cherry-ish nor as almondy as I was expecting and hoped for. I ate a couple slices of this toasted with butter for breakfast but I got to the middle of the loaf and realized it wasn't cooked all the way through.",
