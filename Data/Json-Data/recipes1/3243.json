If you follow the directions and remove from heat after adding the sherry the alcohol taste is so overpowering that it's virtually inedible. Cooking it for a few minutes longer allows the sherry flavor to shine without the alcohol flavor killing it. Second I always remove all seeds from the jalapenos and use just one. It's still spicy but not overpowering. I like this best as a condiment on sandwiches rather than a relish.",
