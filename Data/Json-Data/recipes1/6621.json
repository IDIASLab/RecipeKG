You have to cut the potatoes into fairly small pieces so that they cook quickly and evenly.  It's so important to saute them uncovered first and then when you cover them for the last ten minutes, that is when they really soften up and steam.  Don't lift the lid!  If you have your burner at the right temp, they won't burn and they will come out perfectly.  Sometimes I add frozen peas during the last few minutes of cooking time and I always serve this with basmati rice.  My only complaint is that it makes my house smell like curry the next day!  Otherwise it is great!",

Instead of two whole fresh tomatoes I used a small can of whole tomatoes; I just dumped it all in tomato juices and all. It seemed to give the potatoes more of a sauce. I just ate some of the leftovers for a late breakfast and this seems to be even better the next day. I don't know if kids will like this; I don't have any (which is probably why I'm waking up late enough to want the leftovers for breakfast).:) I was surprised at how well the potatoes cooked; about 12 minutes over medium heat made them perfectly soft enough. Make sure to cut the potatoes into small cubes as the recipe says though; I can see how they might take longer to cook otherwise.",
