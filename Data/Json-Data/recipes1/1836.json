The first time I made this cake I followed the recipe exactly and the cake came out -- delicious. I considered it to be more heavy than dry. The second time there were a lot of differences: I was a bit reckless. I forgot the salt and the jelly and I dumped all the ingredients into one bowl and stirred really hard. I was using two 8x8 inch pans so I increased the recipe (in my head) by and went with the flow. I used three apples. (As I said I forgot the jelly entirely. Oops.) -- The 8x8 pans were so shallow that the lack of jelly -- was no problem at all. In addition to my modifications in order to make it less dry -- I added about a cup of milk. Recklessness indeed! I wasn t sure exactly how it would come out or if that was breaking an age old baking rule -- etc etc. The results. Were. Amazing. I have never eaten a better cake. I think I am accidentally going to have eaten one entire 8x8 pan of this cake by the time tomorrow is over. My grandmother aunt & three cousins loved it as well. So yes as a suggestion: I would suggest -- adding cup milk. There were about three pieces that were eaten before the cake had a chance to sit -- for even 10 minutes and this might seem obvious but the texture was a thousand times better a few hours later. (I m eating a huge piece taking bites inbetween sentences. Mmm!)",
