I used 2 1/2 Quarts of water instead of 3 (but would use 2 next time because it was still too watery) I used 3 cans of corn and 5 smaller potatos I did add a hanful of chopped carrots as well. I followed the seasonings as mentioned but it was way too bland so added salt n pepper to taste (as mentioned) and did the same to the chicken boullion (as referred by another reviewer) I also added Onion powder and garlic powder to taste. sprinkled a little parsley too. it was much more flavorful without being over powering after my tweaking. I wish i could give you the measurments but as i said before I did it by taste. I then used 1 cup of water and 10 TBSP of flour but even after that it was still too watery so I did the easy route and used wondera to thicken it up to the consistacy I was looking for. It turned out GREAT but only after the modifications. I would def. make it again.",
