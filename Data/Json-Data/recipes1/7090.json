I would not put coconut in anything, but that's me.  Might I make a suggestion.  I always do this in two steps.  Make the pasta and the egg mixture first.  Put it together and refrigerate it overnight.  In the meantime dump all your fruits together in a bowl and put them in the fridge as well.  The next day, just before serving, dump your fruit in and stir, and then add your cool whip.  Keeps everything firm without melting down.  I have also always used the colored minature marshmallows, it just gives the salad a more fruity flavor.",

I find that it has a much better texture if you make sure that the pasta, fruit and egg mixture are VERY cold before adding the whipped topping. I usually put the bowl of it in the freezer for half an hour to chill it before adding the CW. I also don't thaw the CW. Makes a great difference. I also find that it tastes better with a little less than the full cup of coconut. Don't let a dislike of non dairy topping prevent you from trying this.",
