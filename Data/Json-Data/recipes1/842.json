This is a fiasco - not only did the THICK batter resemble cookie dough and taste like wallpaper paste but I also burned out my electic mixer... I am VERY dissapointed. I am sorry - truly. P.S. Could there be an error on the recipe ingredients? If so - that could explain why mine was so terrible! (I followed directions and measured accurately!)",

I did 1/2 cup melted butter 1/2 cup oil 2 1/2 cups flour 4 eggs sugar and some vanilla. I mixed it all in my stand mixer and added milk to reach a cake batter texture. I also folded in chocolate chips. I baked it in a loaf pan. It came out dense and the cake part was a little bland. All in all it was OK a little dry. Maybe good if served with pudding custard or fruit sauce. Would only make again if in a really tight pinch.",
