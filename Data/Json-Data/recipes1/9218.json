I read the reviews and modified as follows: 1. 1/2 diced onion 1/2 diced bellpepper 3 diced chicken breasts - saute those 3 ingredients in a few tablespoons of olive oil and add creole seasoning salt and pepper to taste. Needs seasonings or it will be bland! 2. Boil 16 oz. egg noodles. Drain and return to pot. Add cream of chkn cream of mshrm and 7 oz sour cream. Mix in chicken and onion/peppers. Add salt and pepper to taste. Mixing in the chicken instead of adding it to the top keeps it moist. 3. Put in a baking pan and top with Ritz and butter combo (minus the sour cream). Do all that and this is a fantastic dish!",

I mixed the sour cream into the body of the casserole instead of into the crumb mixture. For the seasoning I used some dried herbs dry mustard a little curry and black pepper. Also added sauteed mushrooms and frozen mixed veg. A lot of changes but that's the way I cook -- look for a basic recipe and improvise. I think this is a very good basic recipe.",

I also threw in frozen mixed vegtables which added a ton of color and texture to the dish. I skipped the sour cream and only used half the cracker topping. It was just right. We will make this many more times and would be great if you need something for a potluck. My husband thought is was like a chicken pot pie with noodles. YUMMY!",
