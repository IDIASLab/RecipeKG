That actually IS what the texture of grits should be like. They aren't something you can pick up and eat with your hands. It looks like the recipe turned out just fine for you just you were expecting something different. I gave this recipe 5 stars because it has an average of 4.5 stars right now and maybe my rating can kind of even out the 2 stars of the review below mine since it isn't the recipe's fault that the cook didn't know what to expect and they even said they thought the grits tasted great:o)",

I even cooked them for longer than the recipe asked and they still turned out mushy. We served them like mashed potatoes because they just wouldnlt hold together. What on earth did I do wrong?!
