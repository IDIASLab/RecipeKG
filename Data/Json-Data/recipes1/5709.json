Just tried a few changes - instead of marinating seperately first skewer - try adding mushrooms and scallops - add to a large ziploc freezer bag (just remember to cut the sharp tips off the skewers).  Then add marinade to ziploc bag. Try rolling in a mixture of italian bread crumbs and parmasan cheese(50/50 mix) then grill on a George Forman grill.Then drizzle with garlic butter(it just melted in your mouth).  The mushrooms are awesome and makes the kabobs look bigger.  Makes the shrimp and scallops go further. If the mushrooms are large, cut in half.",
