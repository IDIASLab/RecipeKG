However, last night I made \"Chicken Seasoning Blend,\" also from this site, and I was looking for a chicken recipe to use it on - and this one seemed perfect to rescue, especially since a number of reviewers remarked that this chicken was \"blah\" or \"boring.\"  These two were MADE for each other!  The submitter (in her review) and I were obviously on the same page, as I preferred to prepare this in a skillet  rather than in the oven.  I dredged the chicken in flour, seasoned it with the \"Chicken Seasoning Blend,\" then browned it in the skillet. When making the sauce, the flour is unnecessary.  Once the chicken was done I removed it from the skillet and kept it warm.  I sauteed the mushrooms with fresh minced garlic (and salt and pepper of course), added a good dousing of chicken broth, lemon juice and white wine (Pinot Grigio to be exact), reduced that somewhat, then swirled in some butter at the end to thicken the sauce and to make it rich and velvety smooth.  (measuring these ingredients is really unnecessary - just cook with \"a little of this and a little of that\" and enjoy yourself!)  Served this with pasta and sauteed patty pan squash with dill.  This  dinner, this chicken, was right up my alley.",

I marinated the chicken breasts in the olive oil and lemon juice (with additional spices like poultry spice, italian seasoning, thyme, salt and pepper) for about 3 hours, which made the deeply infused them with lemon. I baked them but also found they didn't brown, and so put them in the broiler for about 5 minutes right at the end to get that nice browned top. I also used 2 whole lemons in the entire process (and had scaled the recipe down to 2 servings) so it was quite lemony, but I like to really taste things. A nice change of pace.",

In my case rather than using 6 breasts for the 4 serving size I used 3 breasts and left the sauce amount as is. There was barely enough for my reduced serving. Anyway the chicken came out beautifully. As other reviewers mentioned it could have used more flavor. I'll make sure to salt and pepper the breasts in the future. In addition the sauce could have used more flavor. I used half broth and half wine for my version. I also added garlic powder but it needed something more. Perhaps a bit of rosemary?? All in all I enjoyed the textures of everything just need to spice it up a bit in the future. My accompaniments were brown rice and asparagus.",

Everybody loved the scent that the lemon put in the air while the chicken was baking and more importantly for my family... they all LOVED the mushroom sauce. I did however use 2 4oz. cans of sliced mushrooms and upped the chicken broth to 1 cup. The only difference was the cooking time for the sauce but it was only a matter of 2-3 minutes...
