First if you do not have 24 hours to let your salad sit over night in the refrigerator than don't make the salad. Be sure to drain your canned fruit well. I also use much less sour cream than is called for in fact I use just enough sour cream to coat all the ingredients cover then chil overnight! Love it!",
