Cooking reduces the nutrient content and DEFEATS the purpose behind a 'green smoothie' If you don't care for kale try spinach or add more fruit (up to 60% fruit 40% veggies) to offset the flavor of the greens. If you find it too thick it's ok to add some water to make it your desired consistency. And if you are adding the flax I find it best to use ground flax seeds.",

Blend this for MUCH longer than you would a regular parsley or spinach green smoothie as kale is very fibrous and you want to make sure to get this as smooth as possibly so you aren't crunching as you sip. Just my two cents! Thanks for the yummy recipe Rice!",

Today I tried it again with a few more changes. In addition to using cow's milk (because that's what I like and what I have on hand), I added a big handful of frozen strawberries, four or five ice cubes, and extra milk. I liked it much better that way . . . both because it was cold and because the flavor was fruitier. It was almost milkshake-like. My little boy (almost 2 yrs old) loved it. With the modifications, this is a four-star recipe.",
