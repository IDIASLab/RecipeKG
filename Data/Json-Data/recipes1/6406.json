Tips: Add more curry depending on your own personal taste omit a little of the mayo or add as needed. Cut the pineapple chunks into smaller pieces I browned the pecans by spraying with Pam then added to salad.They have a nice flavor. Also added craisins as I didn't have golden raisins. Last I used organic grapes and cut them in half. Serve on a bed of lettuce or a hollowed out cucumber (cucumber boat) for added presentation.",
