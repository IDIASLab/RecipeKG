The flavor was there....it just lacks easiness to eat for my kids. The sauce in the quesadillas was the down fall for my kids. The quesadillas very very messy for small hands and adult hands too when trying to cut them into 4ths the sauce being hot squeezed out very where. And the quesadillas barely stayed together. And my kids look like they were playing in finger paint when they were done. I would make these again without the sauce and use the sauce on the side to dip the quesadillas in....so much easier and less of a mess.",
