I love baking that only requires one bowl for all the ingredients. I didn't have fresh cherries on hand so I used a jar of pitted sour cherries (680grams net weight/350grams drained weight) -- this met the recipe requirements perfectly and I used the liquid from the jar as the cherry juice. I will make this again next time I will only add 3/4 the required amount of sugar if using jarred sour cherries. A great way to use up that old jar of sour cherries we had kicking around our cupboard.",

I love the flavor of the fresh cherries right on top & that portion of the dish deserves more than 3 stars. However my cake turned out unevenly baked & overall it was dry. In order for me to enjoy eating it it had to be served with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream to add moisture. I think this problem can be repaired by baking longer at a lower oven temp (350?). Also the cake's flavor isn't decadent but perhaps that's my fault: I only added about 1 c of juice b/c prior to baking the pudding looked so full & gooey already I was afraid of adding too much & it not cooking. More juice would have really helped but I still feel it needs a stronger butter flavor. One tip: be sure to put your dish on a cookie sheet to keep your oven clean! As far as making this recipe again I would use the method of the raw cherries alone on top but with a different cake recipe underneath.",
