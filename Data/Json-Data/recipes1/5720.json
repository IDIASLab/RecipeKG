I guess I was certain the changes would make them good! And it worked. I increased the brown sugar from 1/2 c. to 3/4 c. so they were just a little bit sweet (perfect). I was generous with the berries using a little more than called for. For the flour I used 1 1/3 c. whole wheat and 1 c. white flour. The oats I used were quick-cooking as well. I added a tsp. of vanilla and a pinch of nutmeg. I also folded in about 2/3 c. sliced almonds with the raspberries. These are delish with all the above mentioned changes! I never made the recipe in its original format so I can't comment on that. But if you want a healthy hearty mildly sweet muffin the addendums I mentioned should get you that. Oh yes one more thing I did NOT bake them for 25-30 minutes as the recipe stated. In my oven it only took 18 minutes! I would start checking them around 15-17 minutes just to be safe. Enjoy!",

The texture is thicker, as you would imagine & we liked it, but you could go half & half for a more lighter muffin with the benefits of whole wheat.\r\nInstead of increasing the sugar amount, I coated the berries in white sugar (about 2 Tbs.) before adding. This seemed to be enough extra sweetnees for us. I also liked the nutmeg- and followed other's suggestions by 1/2 tsp.\r\n(Optional: 1 cup of finely chopped walnuts didn't change a thing but taste & texture- We are all \"nuts\" here, anyway. ;-) )\r\n25 mins bake time worked fine. I used the 'ole \"Toothpick\" method for doneness.\r\nOne last suggestion for those with kids with a sweet-tooth: We either give them jelly to slather on them or a small bowl of apple sauce to use for dipping.\r\nLoved using this recipe for a good \"base\" for muffins! They freeze well, also! :-) \r\nThanks \"Min\"!!!",

To liven these up I instead use: 1.5 cu. whole wheat flour 2 t. ground cinnamon 1/2 c. sugar (white or light brown) 1/4 to 1/3 c. of chopped walnuts and sprinkle the tops with turbinado (raw) sugar instead of using the recipe as stated. Sometimes if I have maybe a tablespoon or so of leftover sour cream I will fold that in last. The sour cream makes the muffins really light yet tender. The overall result? Yummy muffins! However because I had to heavily modify to recipe to make the the muffins tasty I'm sorry to say that I could only give it three stars.",

I used whole wheat white flour a teaspoon each of baking powder and baking soda (that's always worked for me so I do that with almost every muffin recipe) lowfat buttermilk instead of plain milk (as that was what I had on hand--I used milk just a different kind of milk) and two cups organic triple-berry mix that was in my deep freeze. These came together quickly and used on hand ingredients which meant it fit really well into my tight budget. Next time I make these I might add a teaspoon of vanilla. I think that was what was missing out of this recipe. I got twelve biggish muffins out of this recipe and 350 for 20 minutes was just right. My youngest son ate three in ten minutes at lunch. I would say that he really liked these. NOTE: For novice bakers I find that a full tablespoon of baking powder that I tried in a previous recipe was too much and the taste of baking powder way overpowered the rest of the recipe. Just wanted to save some of you the trouble if you try this out for yourself.",
