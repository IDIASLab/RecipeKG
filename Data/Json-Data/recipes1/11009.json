No need to top with butter, the topping will brown nicely enough.  You can adjust the fat content by eliminating the butter and using low-fat soup.  I also use the canola Hellman's with no cholesterol.  Ditching the salt brings the sodium content down to next-to-nothing, even with the modicum of worcestershire. When all is said and done, what you're really making here is a custard-- that's why you mix the soup, eggs, and mayo together and then fold in the broccoli and the cheese.  It should never be runny.  The entire casserole can be assembled the day before and refrigerated, then the topping added right before cooking. Enjoy!",

I also used light cheese to lower the fat.  \n\nThe casserole was wonderful and my fiance ended up eating seconds.  I even got my four year old to try it although she decided she still doesn't like broccoli.  I will make again for sure as we really enjoyed this.",

I used the 98% fat free cream of chicken instead of mushroom due to personal preference, but other things I did made this side dish 13g of fat/serving instead of the 40g that the recipe results in.  I used 3/4 c. light mayo (if you only make one change, make it this one!), 3/4 c. 2% milk Cheddar cheese, reduced fat crackers, 1 T olive oil for the onions, and sprayed the top of the casserole with Pam instead of using butter.  Came out tasting just like my grandmother's, and I know she doesn't use low-fat anything!",

Modificaitons: reduce mayo to 1/2 c (light mayo) & add 1/2 c light sour cream, cream of celery soup, 1/4t celery salt, garlic powder to taste. I use almost 2 cups of mixed sharp & mild cheddar cheeses. I also add 10 oz frozen chopped spinach (defrosted). Essentially, this dish can handle 20-36oz of any veggies you've got if your casserole dish is big enough. Top with any flavor CheeseNips (made with real cheese & butter topping not needed ) OR crushed stuffing mix (top with butter)  I find it takes closer to an hour to bake, cover with foil for the first 30-40 min & the topping does better.
