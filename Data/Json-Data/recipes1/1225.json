I have tried to duplicate them over the years and now I know why they were never the same, I wasn't using enough butter or sugar. They taste just like they did when I was younger. My brother and I used to eat the whole batch, which probably  explains why I am overweight now.  Thanks so much. Donna Scudder",

The Eskimo Cookies page is dog-eared from frequent use over three generations. Easy, delicious, fun for kids... we can never wait for them to get cold in the fridge before digging in. My son made them for a school event recently. The kids thought they looked a little strange, but once they tasted them they flew off the plate. Thanks for posting the recipe to share.",
