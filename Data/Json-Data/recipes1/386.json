On my first batch I added the frosting and kiss while the cookies were warm as directed but all they did was melt. On my second batch I re-indented the cookies immediately after baking and then let them cool. Then I piped in the frosting and added the kiss. This worked much better and the kisses maintained their \"kiss\" shape. I did not roll in nuts but instead in holiday sprinkles. I then used candy cane and mint truffle Hershey Kisses. Kids loved them and didn't care how they looked. Cute idea - just needs a little tweeking.",

I thought it was very strange that they didn't call for any baking powder/soda and although the finished product was good they weren't great so I won't be making them again. I made no changes to the recipe except to make them a bit smaller. I also only rolled about half the balls in nuts because my sister is allergic and not too many of my family members care for them. I felt that although the cookie itself was good (I slightly underbaked them so they had a rich fudgy texture) the frosting just didn't fit with the rest of the cookie. I think they would be better if the frosting was entirely skipped and the kisses were placed directly onto the hot cookie (made without the thumbprint of course!)
