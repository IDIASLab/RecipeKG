I had bought instant mashed potatoes and my family hated them so I wanted to use them some other way. This was perfect! Looks like I'll be buying instant potatoes again after all! I did have to add a little more water to get the right consistency. May just add a little less flour next time. This is always different for everyone in bread making depending on the humidity flour used etc. and so I don't find this to be a fault of the recipe. Also those who scored it lower because it didn't \"keep\" long... any homemade bread won't keep as long as storebought which has all the chemical preservatives but it never lasts long enough in my house to know!",

Placed yeast/water mixture in mixer bowl and slowly incorporated the dry ingredients.  Worked like a charm.  Let it rise first time 45 mins (it had doubled in size), then punched down and kneaded slightly. Formed into rolls (made 24) and placed in lightly greased baking pan. Baked for 25 mins at 350 degrees F. So very yummy!  Thank you for the recipe Kathy.",
