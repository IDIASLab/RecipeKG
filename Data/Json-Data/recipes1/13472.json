I used a round pan and it looks just like the main picture :) this will be made OFTEN!!!  I just ate 4 pieces!!  ***** This is an update!! this third time making this I decided to use honey instead of the sugar in the cake itself since the name is Honey Cake, not granulated sugar cake... it was so moist from this that I didn't need to add the milk.  For the syrup I used about a cup of honey with like 5 tablespoons (a splash) of orange juice and one tablespoon of sugar and it is so good!! the best one yet!",
