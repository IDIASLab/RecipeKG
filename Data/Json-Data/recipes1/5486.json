I'm not a fish person and I used cod so it was kind of fishy tasting but I could tell that the base was good and that if I use flounder or haddock next time which are milder this will be outstanding for me. My husband said I could serve this to company! I think I'll try the potatoes next time and leave out the cream because I like a tomato type base better than creamy. I just made this today and I'm going to try again this weekend with a few modifications because I think I'll really like this with a milder fish! Thanks Corwynn!

For the fish, I used halibut and I didn't add into the pot until after 6-7 hours of cooking.  No need to cook the fish the entire time.  I had planned on adding some peas and forgot - will add next time.  And I ended up using 1/4C of skim milk vs the cream.  The taste was ok so I would advise adding pepper and salt to taste.  Once I did that, the taste was awesome.  Will make this again.",
