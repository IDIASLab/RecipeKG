I have tried several recipes and always ended up with a trash can case because I didn't know anything about them as far as making them. (another recipe my Nana failed to give any idea how to make) I am sure once they dry out a little more (because they SHOULD be hard almost like biscotti) they are going to be fabulous! My father is so excited...we used to pay big money for these and they were relatively cheap to make. Be sure to roll out 3/8 inch and I personally like the springerle roller...I have an antique that has quite a story and they came out amazing! Thanks to Shirley....I was able to recapture a little of my childhood this morning:) Do NOT cook this on the company that has the clay cookie/baking sheets...you MUST do it on metal ones!!! (I love their stuff but it will not bake right on it!!!) I did not have any of the problems the first poster suffered....the measurements are all correct. The trick is you MUST whip up the eggs until they are light. This requires some high speed on your mixer's part. I had no problem with anything other than using some of the wrong pans. I was actually even able to resurrect them by rebaking this on metal.",

Once the cookies have been rolled place onto a cloth sheet covered with seeds to dry overnight. If the humidity is low you may want to gently roll the seeds into the dough before flipping it over and imprinting. The amount of flour required is heavily influenced by ambient humidity. In S. Florida we used 4 cups of flour; here in Maryland it varies from 3-3.75. You definitely need to eyeball it. Dough should be stiff to where it looks nearly crumbly coming out of the mixer (the dough hook works well for the last 2 cups of flour). We then refrigerate the dough in wax paper for an hour or 2 before rolling which helps keep it from sticking to the rolling pin. Fresh out of the oven they are crispy on top soft inside but will harden over a few weeks. When baking they should still be white on top.",

I knew it was a mold but wasn't sure what for until I found this recipe on here. With 1/2 the recipe I got about 15 cookies with the size mold I was using. I found the dough to be very hard to bind. I ended up finally resorting to adding 1 Tblsp. of water so that it came together but still remained quite stiff as suggested. I baked them this morning and they held up well. The downside: is I didn't think they tasted that great as they tasted doughy and floury. It kind of reminded me of a sweet unleavened biscuit. We ended up not eating more than one whole cookie. It appears this recipe is well liked. I am not sure if it is because the print holds up or I just don't care for the taste of springerle cookies? I found out today that shortbread also works in cookie molds so I might try that next time. It was interesting learning the method though and trying out my cookie mold for the first time.",
