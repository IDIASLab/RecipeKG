If you decide to try this recipe, there are a couple things you need to know. First, you need to use a thoroughly cleaned glass or ceramic bowl to whip the cream, don't use plastic. Even the smallest amount of oil will prevent stiffening and plastic is too porus. Second, the cookies must be ground to a fine powder, not simply crushed up. You won't get that good gingerbread taste in the ice cream itself if you don't powder your cookies. Maybe do half powder and half chunks if you like that sort of thing. I prefer a smooth ice cream.",

I have also made this ice cream for my sister who can't say enough about it. Love, love, love! Thank you.",

I cut back a bit on the sweetened condensed milk (didn't use the full can) - because other ice creams I've made using this method have come out too sweet for my friends.  I used German spiced cookies instead of gingersnaps.  Since I had extra ice cream that didn't fit in my container, I used leftover ice cream and cookies to make ice cream sandwiches.  Yum!",
