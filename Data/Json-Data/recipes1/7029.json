Furthermore, I made recipe even simpler by placing cauliflower UNCOOKED in a casserole dish, pouring the milk mixture over it and covering with tin foil.  I baked it covered with foil for 35 minutes at 350 degrees F.  Then removed the foil, spread the cracker/butter mixture over the top and baked for 30 more minutes.  Voila!",
