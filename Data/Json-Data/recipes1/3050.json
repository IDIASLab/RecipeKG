I used a 1 teaspoon measuring spoon and made sure I just put a teaspoon for each cookie.  I actually wound up making 58 cookies from this recipe.  Then I melted semi-sweet chocolate chips and spread the chocolate on the flat side of a cookie and put another cookie on top.  They turned out very elegant - better than a Pepperidge Farm cookie.  Of course, your using two of these cookies to make one big cookie, but it's worth it!  I recommend that you use a Silpat baking sheet (I have two).  Let the cookies cool well before you take them off the sheet.  Cool on wax paper before putting the choclate on them.  I am going to use this recipe for special occasions.  Your family will think you've attending a french culinary school!",

Followed recipe as written except I didn't cream the sugar and butter...I combined the dry ingredients and then I added the wet ingredients and mixed everything together.  And I used regular rolled oats instead of quick-cooking.  I patted down the balls a bit with my fingers before baking them to ensure even baking.  I baked them on ungreased silicon mats and they popped right off when I peeled the mat off the pan.  They are very sweet - sort of like a very crunchy sugar cookie.  Very tasty when sandwiched with whipped cream between two cookies!  ",

I burned the first batch (typical for me), then I overcompensated and undercooked the second batch (again pretty typical) but for the third batch, i kept my face pressed against the oven window and alas, the perfect cookie! Okay, so maybe you don't need to press your face into hot glass but these cookies do seem to go from undercooked to overcooked in about 30 seconds and it may be just because my brain wa too warm but it seemed like each batch took a different amount of time. Just watch close is all i'm saying. Lol",

What I ended up doing was adding 1/4 cup more flour. I sprayed the baking sheet with pam and instead of taking the cookies off when cool I let them cool only a minute or two and then took them off while they were still hot. They cooled instantly when off the pan and came off in one piece. They looked perfect and tasted even better!",
