My husband thinks bacon should be a food group so when I saw this recipe I had to try it. I lightly toasted the bread first so it would be nice an crispy then layered everything and put it back into the broiler. I sliced the onion very very thin. Next time I would leave it off altogether. I made some with swiss cheese and some with cheddar - man were these tasty! Try adding a little bleu cheese for a nice twist. Watch these carefully in the broiler you definitely don't want to burn these....",

After realizing that I had no lettuce (typical) lol I stumbled upon this recipe and thought I'd give it a go (I have to admit the name did throw me off for a minute until I realized it must be a mistake lol). I used italian sliced bread (all I had) that I lightly toasted. Also before assembling the sandwich I spread a light layer of mayo just because I like it and was in the mood for it. I eyeballed everything to my liking as well. This was such a nice surprise of a sandwich! I really enjoyed all of the flavors together (I used sweet onion). This really hit the spot and made me glad that I didn't have any lettuce today...This really did make a wonderful lunch and I will surely be making it again! Thanks for sharing.:)",
