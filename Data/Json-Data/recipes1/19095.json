I made a few adjustments but pretty much followed the recipe as written. I only used one can of tomato paste and used a large jar of my homemade tomato sauce. I also just used regular red wine and not cooking wine (not sure what the difference is). I used the nutmeg and added about 1/2 tsp of salt. It was a bit on the sweet side but very tasty - my husband quite liked it. I will use this again when I have leftover roast beef. Thanks.",
