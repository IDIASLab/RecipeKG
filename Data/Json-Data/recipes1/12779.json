I added an 8 oz. can of chunk pineapple with the juice. I froze everything except for the cranberry ginger ale the night before and then left it out to thaw to slush. When it was time for the punch I put the slush in the punch bowl and added the ginger ale. The only change I would have made if time had permitted I would have like to have frozen some of the punch (without the ginger ale) with the pineapple chunks some strawberries and a few mint sprigs in a jell-o mold so it could have floated in the punch.",
