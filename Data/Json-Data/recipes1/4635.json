I've made it 4 times now and this time was my first making it at a high altitude (4500 feet) and with only very slight adjustments it was still very moist! I changed from shortening to butter because I like butter better and I also added 1/4 tsp allspice and an extra 1/4 tsp cinnamon for a spicier cake because it just doesn't smell spicy enough for me the way the recipe calls for. For anyone at high altitudes the only adjustments I made were I removed 1 tbsp sugar and 1/8 tsp of baking powder added 1 tbsp of 2% milk 1 tbsp butter and 1 extra egg and it came out moist and didn't rise too early. It looked and tasted great with a simple cream cheese frosting.",

                "reviewBody": "There is a popular-brand cinnamon swirl cake mix that we can't get anymore where we live and I was looking for a recipe here at Allrecipes.com to replace it. This recipe turned out to be nothing like what I was looking for but I am SO glad I found it. Making the recipe exactly as written the end product is a very dense cake with the texture of a good spice bread. Unlike most of the spice cakes I've had it is not overpoweringly spicy nor is it tremendously sweet. It's a refreshingly different kind of cake and we all really enjoyed it. Some notes/suggestions: (1) I recommend making this in a single-layer rectangular pan. (2) When making this cake batter it is very important that you beat the cake AS STATED for the times stated in the recipe. Your cake will not have the intended texture if you take shortcuts (like hand mixing or mixing for less time than called for) or if you overbeat the batter after the eggs have been added. So...follow the instructions. (3) If you don't like cloves substitute ginger or allspice etc. Just DON'T substitute all of them. Pick ONE as a substitute and go with that. Adding a tsp of three other flavors is going to overpower this cake and make it unfit to eat in my opinion. This is a great recipe. Thanks so much for sharing it.",

Beat shortening(or butter) with sugar until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time beating well after each addition. Alternately add flour mixture and buttermilk and beat for another minute or two before pouring into prepared pans. Came out truly magical! It could use a little more spice perhaps some allspice or more cinnamon. Otherwise absolutely delicious!",

I was confused because it said original recipe - 1 - 9 inch pan but called for 2. The batter seemed really stiff and I decided to check them at 1/2 cooking time-they were already done! The cakes were really crumbly & slightly dry and bland so I make the orange glaze from another recipe adding some almond and rum extract & poked holes in both layers to soak it up. I also added chopped pecans on both layers. I think it's OK but not fantastic. Maybe it'll be better in morning after soaking a bit in fridge. A cream cheese or whip cream frosting would probably be good too. It's just a lot of tweaks for what should be a simple spice cake.",
