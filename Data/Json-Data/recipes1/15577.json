My changes - no oil necessary, use 10 candy canes instead and do not allow the first layer of chocolate to set before adding the white layer - this is what causes them to separate! I use about 12 oz of each chocolate and melt in the mirco in glass dishes.  First, melt the dark or milk chocolate, add extract if desired and pour into a foil lined pan, sprinkle with 1/3 of the crushed candy canes.  Refrigerate about 5 minutes while you melt the white chocolate, also in the micro but only half power for about 3 minutes. Pour the white choc over the top and then add the rest of the candy canes.  Be careful when spreading the white choc or you will end up swirling the 2 chocs together a bit and not have the pretty all-white top.Refrigerate for 2+ hours.  Turn upside down onto a towel and peel off the foil and break into pieces.  By breaking it from the back, you will not break as many of the candy canes on top.  Also, don't crush the candy canes too much or you will end up with powder instead of nice pieces.  Store in fridge.",

I found that using candy canes gave it a much better look. it crushes more to the red side verses the round are more to the white. I also added in 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract to give it a kick to the white chocolate mix after I had melted the chocolate. I also freeze it until I am ready to eat or give out as gifts and it tastes great! This is very simple, very easy to make. the price to make this is so much better then buying it to give out as gifts. When coming from your kitchen how can anyone not like it?

I tried a similar recipe with no extract and it was perfect. If you don't really like peppermint (or the flavor of peppermint extract for that matter) I STRONGLY recommend omitting the extract altogether. I do like the flavor of the semi-sweet chocolate with the white chocolate. I would give this five stars but the peppermint extract flavor nearly ruined it for me. Definately five without the extract but three is being generous for the recipe as written. Another helpful hint it doesn't specify but you need to either use the peppermint on the first layer sparingly or really press it into the semi-sweet chocolate layer. When I cut these the two layers separated on several which was pretty aggravating.",

I melted the first batch of semi-sweet chocolate added a can of sweetened condensed milk and some peppermint extract. I allowed it to see for about a half an hour to fourty minutes and worked on the second layer made of white chocolate. I prepared it the same way I did with the semi sweet and gently covered the first layer. The last or top layer was made with milk chocolate prepared the same way and spread gently over the white chocolate. I then chopped up a small box of candy canes and sprinkled them over the top. My husband loved it! By far this was the best fudge recipe I have ever made though it is extremely rich. I will definatly be making this again!",
