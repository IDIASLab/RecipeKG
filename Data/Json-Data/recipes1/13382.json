Because I prefer a creamy custard I substituted evaporated milk with 1/2 whipping cream, 1/2 vanilla soy milk. I used coconut milk instead of cream of coconut and bagged coconut flakes because they don't sell canned coconut flakes in syrup here. I put the glass pan on a towl in a deep cookie sheet which I placed in the oven and filled with water for even heating. After an hour, the custard was pale and beautifully cooked, so I sprinkled some white sugar (1/4 cup) on the top and broiled it on high until the top was golden and crunchy. Then I cooled it and refrigerated it for 2 hours. Lovely creamy custard with a sweet crunchy top.",

I had to use coconut milk in place of the cream of coconut and added a 7 oz package of flaked coconut since I've never seen coconut in syrup. This would have been good with or without the flaked coconut. Similar to flan but not as firm. Still this was not too heavy and made a nice after dinner dessert. Thanks for sharing Tanya.",
