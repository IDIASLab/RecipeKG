I've been looking for quite a while for some tricks to make my tuna salad more like those that restaurants serve and less like me just opening a can and adding ingredients at random. This did the trick! I omitted the crab meat (because I don't eat crab) and used dill pickle juice (instead of the relish as I didn't have any). I used freshly grated pepper instead of lemon pepper. It was excellent. I scarfed it down immediately.",
