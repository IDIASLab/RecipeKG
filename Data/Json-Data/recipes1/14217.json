I fixed the marinade in the morning, bumped up the heat-factor a little, used fresh cilantro from my garden (made all the difference) and threw it in a bag along with the juice of a couple limes.  I marinated it all afternoon and then threw it on the grill.  While grilling, I coated it with coarse ground pepper and squeezed fresh lime juice on each side.  Definitly a keeper!  My husband was disappointed he was travelling the next day and couldn't take the leftovers for lunch.  Instead, I sliced up the cold chicken and served it on a salad.  MMMMMMmmmmmm-good!

Fabulous combination of flavors and just enough spice to get you going. It tasted like a restaurant meal.\n\nI didn't change the ingredients at all -- simply doubled the spice rub because I wanted a more intense flavor.\n\nI made only the slightest change to the directions - using a foolproof technique I learned with pork chops. I put the spice rub on the chicken about three hours before cooking. Then 30 minutes before cooking I took the chicken out of the fridge and let it \"rest.\"\n\nAfter browning, I removed the chicken, deglazed the pan with the lime juice, returned the breasts for a few minutes, then covered the pan, turned off the heat and let everything \"rest\" again for about 10 minutes. \n\nThe two \"resting periods\" make pork chops (and chicken breasts) come out both well cooked and very moist and delicious.\n\nThis is a keeper, and I can't wait to make it again!!!",

I can't understand why anyone would use a  fake-tasting product when the real thing is both inexpensive and readily available. If you want to make this dish worlds better, mash 3-4 garlic cloves to a paste. Apply to the chicken with the spices. For the sauce, mash another clove or two of garlic (or to taste) and replace that awful powder. Infinitely superior, fresh, and tasty. Try it this way - you won't believe the difference!",
