Seasoning with salt, pepper and garlic. I also used chicken broth instead of water (which in my opinion, makes any soup better than using \"just\" water). I then let my diced potatoes simmer until mushy, adding milk, letting that warm up, then adding corn and green beans and then the potatoe flakes. I love it...reminds me of the sausage/potatoe soup at Olive Garden",

I made this with a little more veggies (3 large fresh carrots and 3 stalks of celery along with the onion) so I increased the liquid to 1 can of chicken broth & a can & a half of water (with 1 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning for extra flavor) - so then I had to increase the potato flakes to 1-1/2 cups! I used about 5 cups of red potatoes (skin on) and added my chunked-up smoked sausage to the veggies to brown it a little. I ended up with a great big pot of yummy stick-to-your-ribs coziness in a bowl. Really good with warm french bread from our grocery store bakery. We'll be making this often during the winter ahead!",

I did not have potato flakes so grated a raw potato and put it in with the cubed potatoes.  I used Hillshire kielbasa which the taste did not over power the rest of the ingredients.  The results were super.  Oh, I made a little white sauce using melted margarine, flour and adding a little cream.  I needed a little thickener since I had no potato flakes. This recipe is now one of our favorite soups.  Thanks.",

I only used a half onion used about a cup of sliced fresh carrots instead of frozen and didn't have any green pepper so I excluded that. I threw everything (I didn't saute anything) except the potato flakes and milk into the slow cooker on high for 4 hours--with enough water to cover everything and added the milk and flakes in the last few minutes. I also used turkey kielbasa to be a bit healthier and left the skins on the potatoes--healthier and faster. IT WAS GREAT!! And it freezes well too. THANKS!",
