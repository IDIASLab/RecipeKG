One nice large crisp one is a good starter, they are very mild and extremely flavorful, I even add them to my chicken soups etc. Enjoy, and God bless.        Wolf",

I am also watching my carbs so I substituted the bulgur wheat for 2 cups of chopped celery, and substituted the vegetable oil for olive oil. I did cook it a little while longer than the recipe called for. It was fantastic! We ate it with cornbread (it could have also been a nice side dish, or over white rice)Next time I think I will attempt to throw it in the crock-pot and see how it turns out. Thank you!",
