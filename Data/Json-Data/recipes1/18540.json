I cooked it at the same time as the ham which called for 275 F so I cooked it about an hour and a half cranking it up to 350 F for about 20 minutes at the end. Main point: everyone loved it! I will definitely make it again as it was easy to prepare ahead of time and quite yummy.",

Well I didn't change anything Except: I didn't have some things So I tried other stuff in the place of it. Not much though! I kept the recipe the same but I didn't have the loaf bread. (I used 2 gigantic homemade stale biscuits I had made)in place of the Italian bread and I didn't have bacon so I used 1lb. of R.B. Rice hot sausage in the place of it. Oh my goodness was it good! I am a big cheese person but hate cottage cheese and it was sooooooo good in this casserole. My son stays here one day a week because of his job and he lives out of town and can't wait for him to have this for his breakfast at 7 a. m. This Tuesday! I may have to make an extra casserole just to send home to the family! I think it would make a good supper food! (maybe a new tradition)MMMMM",

I have tried many recipes but this is definately one if the best. I added a little more egg/milk mixture before I put it in the oven so it wouldn't be too dry. My Italian bread cubes were pretty big. It was crispy on top moist in the middle had an awesome flavor and the cottage cheese middle was a nice addition. The only thing I might change is using a little less onion especially if you have little kids. But I will definately make this next year.",

I did make some minor adjustments: I used non-fat cottage cheese lowfat mozzarella half the onion amount because my kids can be a bit finicky. I cooked the onions with olive oil instead because I chose to use lowfat Hormel Real Bacon Pieces for faster prep and less clean up. I served it with pancakes and maple syrup for that sweet and salty flavor. I do suggest prepping the night before so you only need to pop in the oven the next day. This dish will definitely be added to my family's recipe book and Christmas brunch tradition from now on.",
