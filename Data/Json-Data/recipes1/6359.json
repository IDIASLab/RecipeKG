This is NOT a potluck item or the deli slop you get at the supermarket; it's designed to be featured in a menu of complementary dishes.  I continued the Caribbean theme and grilled jerk chicken (Jay's), accompanied with a spicy mango salsa (both recipes on this website) and rice.\r\n\r\nAs with all dishes calling for produce or herbs, freshness is key! -- most ingredients were purchased the same day at a farmer's market.  Used Yukon potatoes and fresh sweet corn sliced from the cob.  Cucumbers add an unexpected freshness and texture.  After a decade of cilantro overkill, this dished utilized it for maximum definition.  The dressing was wonderful; just added a little extra lime for zip.\r\n\r\nWill be using this dish repeatedly -- especially at potlucks where previous reviewers will leave it for me to take home and devour!",

I made it for a gathering and everyone loved it! \nI used parsley instead of cilantro...only because I goofed when I bought it, but I'm not a big fan of cilantro so it worked out for me! \nI also doubled the entire dressing part of the recipe and used about 2/3 of the amount of the dressing I made. \nI bought two medium russet potatoes because they didn't have the giant ones, also bought a yam (or so it was labled - I don't really know the difference). \nAlso, I cooked the potatoes the day before, dunked them in ice water after cooking (as stated) and then sealed them a plastic container in the fridge. I think this really helps set the potatoes so that they don't fall apart. I also made the dressing the day before and I think that helped meld the flavors. \nI mixed the solid ingredients at home before taking to the outing and I put the dressing on at the VERY LAST minute right before serving.",

I made it a day in advance as I wasn't going to have time on Monday to make this. Big mistake. I don't know quite what happened, but on Monday this tasted really different. The cucumber had shed a lot of water so it was watery and bland and not very appetizing. I am going to try and salvage this tonight, somehow but if you do decide to make this.. make it on the same day you are planning on serving it. letting this sit overnight like some salads does not improve the flavor. I didn't add the nuts until I was ready to serve so those were kept crunchy.",
