I couldn't get the egg whites with sugar to form stiff peaks - they were more like marshmallow fluff but it baked up fine. I'll definitely use this recipe again. I may recommend putting it in a chocolate crumb crust. I referred my mom to the recipe and she let me know that you can make the custard easily in the microwave. Just stir it after a minute or two until it's thickened. So much easier!",
