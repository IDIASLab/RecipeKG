I used mixed peel/candied peel not citron but the taste was overpowering so you could not taste the chocolate or the original cannoli taste I first had as a teen (just the ricotta and sugar and nothing else) I have just made another batch without the fruit or choc next time I may use 1/2 cup choc and 1/4 cup peel as I think this may balance out the flavours better. I actually have this exact recipe on the back of an old box of cannoli forms made by hoan I think the 8 mins deef frying was prob an eror and should read 3 as 8 mins would turn them black.",

The dough itself is pretty tough so you have to knead for at least 5 minutes before you get it to the right consistency. Also make sure you roll them out as thin as you can which is difficult because of the dough consistency. They should be nice and thin with a little bubbling. The cooking time for me was about 5 minutes as I only submerged them half way in oil. The recipe itself is good. Nice flavoring but I'm still on the lookout for the perfect shell recipe!",
