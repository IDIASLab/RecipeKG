I used cheddar and pepper jack cheese with a couple dashes of hot sauce because I love bold flavors. This is my mistake but I didn't know what four cups of cooked pasta would be so I just cooked a pound of pasta which ended up being too much. Next time will measure like I should! EDIT: I made this again measured correctly and used cheese soup instead of mushroom. I will definitely use the cheese soup again it just gives it a little something extra.",

I doubled the recipe so I'd have enough for leftovers but I wrote the recipe down wrong so I only added 1 cup milk instead of 2 cups like I should have when I doubled it. I used 1 package of 2-cheese blend & 1 package of cheddar cheese & 1 package of parmesan cheese. I added 4 cooked chicken thighs that I had cut into cubes to the mix. I cooked it for about 5 minutes longer than said. My boyfriend loved it! He had seconds & thirds! I on the other hand didnt really like it it was to cheesy for me. But I had it for lunch the next day and I loved it. Def. better the second day around. I now make this recipe almost weekly its an easy to make and works well for work lunches. I like to add peas celery & onions. I also added sour cream once because I needed to get rid of it & it tasted great! Its a simple easy recipe that you can change to make it your own. A sure keeper!",
