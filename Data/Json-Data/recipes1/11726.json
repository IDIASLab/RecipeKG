So next time, I'll omit the brown sugar and reduce the amount of chili sauce by half, replacing the rest with tomato sauce. A little tip for those that those that had a problem with the rice taking longer to cook or that it wasn't finished, it could be from stirring it around too often while the rice is cooking. I did not lift the lid from the pan while it simmered to prevent the steam from escaping (which is what cooks the rice) and it came out perfectly. Also, there's no sense in browing the meat and transferring it to another pot. Just start off browning the meat in a large pot and adding all of the other ingredients as directed.",

Cooked mine in low heat for about 40 mins added 1.5 cups of medium salsa instead of the water, and a can of corn and once I placed all the ingredients in the casserole dish before baking it I put a layer of refried beans and sprinkle the cheese. I also added some taco seasoning, cumin, and some fresh garlic when I cooked the meat, since i find that the meat picks up all the flavors when you brown it (I will never brown any meat without spices, is like showering without soap!)",

I made the recipe as written, only using a homemade salsa instead of chile sauce. I just found it extremely blah-tasting, and ending up rolling mine into a tortilla w/ additional salsa, cilantro, avocado, and other chopped veggies. The other thing that perplexed me was the dirtying of 3 dishes, when realistically, it could all be prepared in one large pot, and one could even skip baking it, and just let the cheese melt on top right on the stovetop, conserving energy (and possible calories, by using cheese to one's garnishing preference.) If I were to make this again, I would brown the beef in taco seasoning, ditch the brown sugar, and add minced garlic, more cumin, and maybe some frozen corn or black beans for added filling fiber.",
