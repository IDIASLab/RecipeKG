Each family has their own way of baking the Easter Pie in the Old Country, and with our family and friends it was discussed at length, believe me! This pie is made the week before Easter and offered to guests for at least a week around Easter (it will keep that long). Traditionally, it is left in the pan which it is baked in and is served from the pan. Enjoy!",

I don't know whether that's the recipe or the chef though because I don't tend to use a method like that for pastry so I could just be inexperienced. It was as someone else said quite a complicated pie to put together and it took me quite a while but I think it was worth it although unless anyone gives me any tips I'll just use my usual pastry for the crust.",

I agree with other reviewers that the dough is very difficult to work with. 2 cups flour is too much, I added 1 3/4 cups and it was plenty. The dough is crumbly and it is imposible to cut it. I put it into baking springform and pressed with my fingers. It is the only one way that I could do with it. I didn't have enough dough to make the lattice strips. So I ended up making crumble topping. The recipe makes too much filling, so be sure to make large edges. The filling is a little runny but it sets quickly in the oven. I think the pie has too much rice, 3/4 cup would be enough.",

If you're unsure about the orange blossom water, you might try reducing the amount by half; it's pretty powerful stuff. I might bump up the zest, too. Next time, I would blind-bake the crust and maybe omit the lattice crust\u2014or bake the pie partway, until the surface firms up, and try to add the lattice mid-bake? When I set the dough strips on the filling, they started to sink down into it, and the filling's so wet, they didn't bake all the way through. The filling started browning before the crust was set, so I covered the top with foil for the last part of baking. Worth experimenting with this one, though.",
