The spinach is always piled way higher than my 9x13 dish I have to try to pack it down to get it all to fit inside but it bakes down so no worries. I have tried this with cod and tilapia both are good but when using tiliapa put a little extra water to the bottom of the dish so the spinach does not dry out.. Also do not over cook or spinach will dry out. One of my favorite recipies!!!!",
