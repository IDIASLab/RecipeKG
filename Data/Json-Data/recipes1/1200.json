In my mind, shortbread contains butter, flour and sugar in the proper proportions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the good reviews associated with recipe convinced me to try it.\r\n\r\nI don't write reviews for recipes because, hey, they're only recipes, right?  Let me tell you that this cookie recipe is shockingly good.  All the reviews are right-- this is a shortbread with a completely unique presentation and taste.  Try it, follow the recipe exactly, and your cookies will rock.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 11/27/2002.  Made them again, and they are still quite fine.  Correct temperature is 350 degrees F, however, and cooking time is 9 minutes.  Watch the edges REALLY CAREFULLY because they burn suddenly.\r\n\r\nSome reviews claim this recipe can be powdery.  That is true IF you eat these cookies hot.  For some reason these cookies taste a little better the day after.\r\n\r\nIf you want people to think you fussed, drop the dough from an icing bag onto your ungreased cookie sheet, through a large star icing tip.",

I find with these that in order to achieve the golden brown bottom, I had to remove them from the over just before they were starting to brown, because you need to let them sit on the cookie sheet for a couple of minutes before removing them, so they don't break apart. This achieves your golden brown bottom.",

I topped them with a tiny amount of icing and Christmas sprinkles, just to make them prettier.  One thing I learned while making them is: the batches I left in the oven a minute longer were a lot less likely to fall apart.  The first batch I made, about half of them crumbled apart while removing them from the cookie sheet, but after that, I just added a minute to the baking time and it seemed to solve that problem.  I will be making these bad boys EVERY year!!",

I have dipped them in chocolate and added sprinkles and they look great.  Yesterday I added the rind from an orange for a citrus-y flavor, it was very subtle but well received.  These cookies do honestly melt in your mouth, they are a cinch to make and are fairly inexpensive to prepare-what more could you ask for in a recipe?  Thanks for sharing it!",
