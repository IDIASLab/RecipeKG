Next, double the recipe because it only makes about half of the amount it says. Also, mine baked in 6 minutes.  These are yummy cookies though!  When I took them out of the oven they were much darker than the usual so I thought they'd be hard and dry, but wuite the contrary!  They were slightly crispy on the edges and moist and chewy in the center!  Yahoo!",

I've made the Toll House recipe for 20 years, but today I only had 1 stick of butter and I had promised my 6yr old that we could make cookies today! So I came on here looking for a recipe that called for only one stick of butter. It's honestly just as good as the toll house recipe. I'm definitely keeping this one because it makes far fewer cookies, which means less baking tme and fewer calories in my belly ;) I didn't mix the ingredients exactly how it says in the recipe. I did it the same as I do when making Toll House. Cream the butter and sugar first, then mix in the egg and vanilla. Mix dry ingredients in separate bowl, add to wet mixture while the mixer is running. Then add chips. I use a scoop for all my cookies, which makes about 2-2.5\" cookies. This recipe made 36 of them, cooked for 6.5 minutes. These are delicious according to the 2 kids and 2 adults in my household!",
