With Hubs out of town I wanted something simple but special for supper and this appeared to be what I had in mind.  I wasn't about to fire up the grill however.  I removed the chicken breasts from the marinade, put them in a shallow pan and drizzled them with melted butter and a few good shakes of salt and pepper.  I baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then sprinkled them with paprika and finished them off under the broiler for a couple of minutes to give them an attractive golden-brown color. I let them rest for a few minutes and in the meantime prepared a bed of baby spinach and arugula, sliced avocado and grape tomatoes. I drizzled them with a light lemon Dijon vinaigrette, then laid the sliced chicken over the bed of greens. For added measure I then poured over some of the wonderful juices that had accumulated in the pan. Moist, tender, juicy and with outstanding flavor.  I was incrediby impressed that this seemingly unremarkable marinade would prove to be so spectacular.  I did use olive oil rather than vegetable oil and skipped the ginger as it doesn't move me - these were small changes that nevertheless were necessary for me and suited my tastes perfectly.  This chicken was so good I can't imagine it suffered at all from being baked and not grilled, and because it turned out SO good I know I'll probably prepare them the same way next time.",

I use olive oil instead of the suggested vegetable oil but if you stick with the main ingredients you will be fine. MOST IMPORTANT is the longer you marinade the better!!! I prefer it to be overnight so the flavor is full and completely through the meat. you can also do with fish just don't marinade longer than 4 hours as the acids in the soy and lemon will begin to cook the fish. \r\n\r\nLOVE IT!!!!\r\n\r\nHuha",

I don't have a barbecue so I baked them in a glass dish, in the marinade, at 425 degrees for 30 min.  My chicken was a tad dry.  I probably should have baked 5-10 min. less.  I think this would've tasted better if I'd had a barbecue to use.  The recipe does not make much marinade and I barely had enough to cover 2 chicken breasts.  The lemon flavor really came through.
