Fabulously easy; I baked them 11 to a sheet - 4 on the outside and 3 up the middle - giving them a bit of room to spread.  Used a basic cookie scoop and packed them a smidge generous.  Baked them 13 minutes per tray - and I put the upper rack 'up' a level.  Came out chewy, not crisp (and I think these would be good crisp, too).  I used dates and pecans as listed, but I'm positive that chocolate chips would be good as well.  I'm putting this one in the holiday rotation this December.  I expect my mom will be looking for the recipe.",
