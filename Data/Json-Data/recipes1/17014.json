I had to change a few minor things just for lack of ingredients in the household. First I used about 1/2 a yellow onion instead of the green onion and onion powder. Instead of beef broth I used a little more than two cups of water along with 3 beef boullion cubes. I also added 4 cloves of minced garlic when browning the venison. It was perfect with mashed potatoes. In case you don't have white wine a dry red would work also just with different results.",

I had to use what I had in the house so I used beef bouillion and water instead of beef broth and canned mushrooms instead of fresh. I had some leftover venison tenderloin and added enough venison butterfly steaks from the freezer to make a pound. I kept the amounts of everything else the same and simmered on the stove for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. I thickened the extra sauce make a yummy gravy and served it over brown rice. Very tender!
