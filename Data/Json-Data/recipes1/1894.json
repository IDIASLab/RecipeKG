The combination of raspberry, almond and chocolate was heavenly. Possibly the best coffee cake I've ever made.",

The first time, the cake didn't even last a day before getting gobbled up.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen making this second recipe, I used a springform pan rather than a plain 8-inch pan like I did the first time. Much easier to get the cake out of the pan, but make sure the pan is securely set because raspberry juice will drip out onto the oven floor. And make sure you have enough cooking spray in the pan so that cake will be easy to remove.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first version I made did not have glaze, and we loved it regardless. The second version I made did have glaze. I didn't care much for the glaze; it was so sweet! I think this cake stands out on its own without it! Still, your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\n\r\nI used frozen natural raspberries. They work great. But make sure they're thawed before measuring them out. And be sure to drain the juice, too. Also, in both recipes, I followed the other reviewers' advice and doubled the recipe. It was very difficult to spread out the batter into the pan the first time. The second time, I added a few tablespoons of milk, and it made quite a difference! Don't worry if you don't have enough batter to spread out on top. The almonds will cover the cake nicely.",

I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 (I think doubling it would have overflowed my 8 inch cake pan), added 2 tablespoons of skim milk to wet ingredients, spread 2/3 of batter, then raspberries, then final 1/3 of batter, and omitted the frosting.  I did not have sliced almonds, but I did have whole almonds, so I ground them pretty fine in a coffee grinder and sprinkled them on top, PERFECT!  Really looked like a crumb top!
