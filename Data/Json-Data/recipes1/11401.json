First the bacon removed it added the eggs to the same skillet and when the eggs were cooked crumbled the bacon in the skillet and added the beans and 1/2 the cheddar. I felt it needed more oomph so I added some hotsauce to the mixture and heated it through. Spooned the mixture into each shell wrapped it up added the rest of the cheese to the shell to seal the ends tight then cooked it over the skillet for a nice and crunchy burrito.",

And don't skimp when it comes to putting the items on the tortilla. It tastes so much better when you put 2 slices bacon and slather on the beans. I cooked the bacon in the oven (I like crispy cooked bacon) and made the eggs scrambled. Then I put all ingredients on tortilla and rolled then stuck in microwave to melt cheese/heat through. I did serve it with salsa but when you slather the beans and 2 slices of bacon I didn't need the extra flavor of the salsa. I will make this again. Thank You!",
