I couldn't find the Italian Herb Saut\u00e9 Express Saut\u00e9 Starter so I looked up it's ingredients and added them my self. 1/2 stick butter, about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, no salt, crushed red peppers, garlic and onion powder, basil, sage, and rosemary. I was out of marjoram, oregano, thyme, and savory so just omitted them. I also made the linguini homemade with semolina flour. I then followed the ingredients and process as listed. I will make this again.",

We all loved it and I'm thinking this might even taste good with chicken instead of the shrimp, although this was a great meal as is!\n\nUpdate:  If you don't have the saute express just use olive oil and butter or margarine and Italian seasonings, it is a great substitute and still just as flavorful and you can control the amount of fat.  Also, it tastes just as good with angel hair pasta, thin spaghetti, or whole wheat thin spaghetti.  This is quick and full of flavor!!",
