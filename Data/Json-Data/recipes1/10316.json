Really good... the only thing I would do differently is either make it like this and use it as a side dish or add some garlic infused chicken for some protein. My hubby missed some \"meat\"! I will certainly make this again. It was very easy! Thanks Lesley!",

I had to make some adjustments based on what I had on hand - first off I was very disappointed to find I had no white wine so ended up using all stock half vegetable and half chicken. I also used the fresh herbs I had on hand - rosemary basil chives and sweet marjoram - and even though I bought fresh mint I decided not to use it in this. I added half the stock in the beginning and half after that had been absorbed. Finally used the last of my really good parmesan and was pretty generous with it - maybe a good 1/2 cup or so. This was the perfect combination of \"homemade with love\" and \"restaurant quality\". Wonderful recipe for the novice risotto maker like me! Thank you!",
