I baked it for 20min uncovered and it was perfect! Topped off with some grated marble cheese. Mmmmmm tasty!",

What I did: I halved the recipe using one eggplant. Instead of bread crumbs I used about a cup (cooked) of whole wheat cous cous (I accidentally made way too much cous cous but I'll talk more about that in a sec...). I used WAY less oil than called for maybe 4 tablespoons at most. I only had some shredded cheddar and some shredded parmesan cheese so I mixed the cheddar into the filling and used the parmesan on top the last 5 minutes of cooking. I pre-roasted my eggplant halves (sprayed with olive oil spray) for about 15 minutes while sauteing the filler veggies then filled th eggplants and baked it all for another 15 minutes adding parm cheese in the last 5. Everything was perfectly moist flavorful and the skins were toothsome but tender enough to cut and eat. Now what to do with all this extra cous cous I prepared? Luckily there was about a cup and a half of veggie filling that just wouldn't fit into the shells (and I stacked and packed those suckers high!) so I mixed it all together along with the leftovers of a balsamic vinegar swiss chard that I made as a side but found the taste too strong. Voila! Instant lunch for the next day! My husband and I each got 2 meals from this and the leftover filling!",
