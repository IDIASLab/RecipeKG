I know how much fire is in 1 tsp of cayenne so to please the family I cut cayenne down to 1/4 tsp Tabasco to 1/2 tsp. Still had a good ZING! Served with rice. Leftovers were even better the next day.

I cannot explain what exactly is lacking....but there is an underlying blandness to the whole recipe despite the amount of spices and salt I put into it. I am knowledgeable of other types of cuisines that usually use a lot of spices with their food to create the flavour...such as Indian and Latin American ethnic dishes. I will try the recipe again and possibly re-rate the recipe but this time maybe I will use a richer tomato sauce and add something else to the shrimp stock to give it that boost.",

We're thinking of serving this over linguine orzo or risotto next time instead of rice. I did not use bacon fat. I substituted olive oil.
