The chocolate ice cream doesn't really replicate the richness of a chocolate bar, so you have to really like chocolate ice cream to enjoy, and it's not my favorite.  The miniature marshmallows really weren't gooey like in a S'more, despite the blow torching.  All in all, not bad, but not something I will make again.",
