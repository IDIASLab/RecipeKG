I added a touch more butter and skipped the unsalted butter with no issues; I made up for it by not adding salt later. I did not have chilies to mince so I added some chili flakes while the balsamic was reducing. Everyone asked me for the recipe. Will do this one again. I love balsamic reductions and have done many such as fig port brandy wine etc. This one is perfect as a pinch hitter when wanting something elegant without flour.",
