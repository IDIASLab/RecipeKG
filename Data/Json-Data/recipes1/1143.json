The previous reviews are correct; the recipe should call for 8 tsp. soda not 8 Tbsp. Other helpful hints: 4 1/2 c. br. sugar = 2 lbs; 2 cups butter = 1 lb; 3 lbs. peanut butter = a total of 5 3/8 cups; 18 cups rolled oats = more than a 42 oz. box. I shake down my measurement of oats and figure generously; it helps the flattening problem. I also chill the dough before forming the cookies to help prevent flattening. I use 1 lb. each of mini chocolate chips and M&M's and I much prefer the crunchy peanut butter; the pieces of peanuts add wonderful texture. Do not overbake these! Remove them from the oven while the cracks are still shiny and wet looking then let them set several minutes before removing them from the pan so they won't fall apart while handling them. This makes a mountain of cookies but it's wonderful keeping a supply in the freezer for unexpected guests and gatherings; we've never had any problem getting rid of them!",

It is absolutely my most favorite cookie in the world; however I should warn you that 8 TABLESPOONS of baking soda is a bit too much for this recipe. I made that mistake the first time I made them. It leaves a little after-taste although I still devoured them completely up. I suggest using 8 teaspoons instead. My recipe also includes 1 cup of nuts 2 cups of coconut and 1/2 cup wheat germ.",
