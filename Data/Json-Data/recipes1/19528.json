But- I need to suggest a few changes. First, it will take longer than 30 mins to get cold enough to whip. Mine took about an hour and a half (though this will depend on how cold your fridge is). Second, after frosting your cake, chill until serving. Like buttercream, it will tend to melt a little bit.",

We put a bit more semi chocolate than white chocolate and put 4 tablespoons of Tim Hortons cappuccino mix with the hot cream. My cousin loved it so much he was tempted to eat the whole batch without the cake! My only complaint was that it melts very fast when frosting but solidifies pretty quick after it's whipped the second time and put in the fridge overnight. Still it went well with everyone so I highly recommend it.",
