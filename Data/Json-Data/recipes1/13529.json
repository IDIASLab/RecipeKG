I used whole wheat flour instead of white and increased the baking powder to nearly 2 teaspoons instead of 1 1/2 teaspoons to compensate for the heavier flour. I also used 2 teaspoons of almond extract instead of 1 teaspoon and used 1 1/2 cups of coconut instead of 1/2 cup. I then used a small scoop to form the balls instead of rolling them with my hands. The cookies really spread out in the oven and came out larger than I expected. While they were still warm I rolled them up to look like Lady's Fingers. They look great and taste really good! I would definately make this recipe again and also use my alterations!",

Used applesauce instead of butter used only a cup sugar used 2 tsp. vanilla extract used almond flour and cup sweetened coconut flakes. I tried different toppings too. Some with choco. chips chopped walnuts tsp. peanut butter in the middle cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice. I baked them for about 16 minutes but checked on them every 2 min. after 10 minutes. I wanted the bottoms that perfect golden brown and they were!! Can't wait to surprise hubby with yummy cookies!! Good recipe but no one needs that much sugar or butter at all lol!!",

A little less butter and sugar and another egg instead of the water? Also they cook better at 375 degrees.
