Now I'm sure this is excellent made the way it is supposed to be but it is soooo good baked with the toppings on it! It took a little over half an hour in the oven in a jelly roll pan because of all of the toppings on the dough but it was well worth a little extra baking time! I did halve both the cream cheese and mayo and add a little ranch to the cream cheese mixture. Next time I would DEFINITELY halve the cauliflower- I used a pretty average sized head and I still had a ton left over.",
