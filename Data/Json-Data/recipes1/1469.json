Instead of offering revised recipes, you should try it how it's written first.  The marshmallows float to the top melting over the chocolate cake giving it a chewy brownie like crust.  If you're fishing the marshmallows out or melting them in the recipe, you're missing the best part of this cake.  Make it like the recipe says and you'll be calling it \"crack cocaine cake\" like I do.  It's addicting.  My absolute favorite chocolate cake ever.  Thank you sassy!!!\n\nAmended to add - I just made the cake again today for my husand's birthday as it is his favorite.  I added an extra cup of marshallows too.  Chewy delicious crust!!  So so so good.",

I read the other reviews and saw where people didn't think the cake had enough chocolate,so I used 5 tablespoons of cocoa with the cake and 3 tablespoons in the icing.  It was really GOOD!  I think this brought it to the level of chocolate I needed for my craving.  Can't wait to make it again this weekend for my friends birthday!",
