After sitting for a day the cake was really dry except for the sauce soaked parts.The only way I would serve this to company is topped with a fruit sauce like sauteed strawberries and sugar but I won't be making this one again.",

First I peeled cored and sliced apples into 8ths. and placed at the bottom of the buttered dish(in a pretty pattern). I then made a caramel sauce and poured on top of apples. Lastly I poured the cake batter on top of evreything and baked as usual. Came out fabulously perfect! Can make it using a butterscotch syrup too instead of the caramel. Did not make the sauce that comes with this recipe. I just served with a drizzle of store bought caramel sauce. Yummm!",

I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 as I felt that after 3 tablespoons of vanilla 3 sticks of butter and a cup of sour cream that there should have been a more intense flavour....it just needed more \"oommph\". However it was a great base for strawberries and vanilla ice cream.",
