Simmered 5-10 minutes longer than recipe stated. The grocery store didn't have monterey jack cheese, so we used colby jack instead. Served with cornbread. My husband said, 'mmmmmm,' after every bite. Next time, I'll make a double batch so there are more leftovers! Thanks for a fabulous recipe!",

I tweeked it this way: used 3T. olive oil one chopped purple onion two cloves of chopped garlic and I added another can of cannellini beans that I had ground to paste in my mini chopper. This really gave the mix the consistancy of chili rather than soup. I used 3 chopped precooked grilled chicken breast that I bought in my store's freezer section. (Don't knock 'em 'till you've tried them. They're not bad.) A couple of shakes of celery seed Louisiana red hot and 1/4 cup sherry and...look out! You talk about good!!! This is a great concept recipe but I think you'll be pleased if you take my recommendations.",

However I doubled the spices except I added fresh cilantro (about 1/4 cup) instead of dried as well as the juice of a lime. With those additions it was excellent. it took my family forever to get to the table when I made it so it boiled down to a thick mixture. Otherwise I would have needed to add some smashed beans for thickener. I cooked the chicken breasts whole and just shredded them after they were cooked. Much easier than cutting up raw chicken. I have six children who can be picky at times but they all loved this chili. This is definitely a keeper.",
