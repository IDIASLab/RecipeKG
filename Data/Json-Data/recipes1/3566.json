I also substituted starch for flour. I find starch is actually easier to work with than flour and clumps less. I put grated taco cheese and green onion on top. It was great. I also find that you can fix a thin recipie by adding more corn starch. I had to add 2 more table spoon of starch to get the resipie to the thickness that I desired but I expected that as I think I made more than the recipie called for. I read a few of the comments beforehand and frankly you have to know how to cook to be able to use a recipie. Otherwise you are just practising and the recipie may turn out terrible but after practice a recipie can be wonderful.",

Thanks to the 2tsp of paprika it looked like I was stirring a pan full of orange vomit. Also it never thickened. I barely used enough water to cover the veggies. Should it perhaps be drained before adding everything else? I dumped the whole disgusting mess in the disposal and went out to eat. Do yourself a favor and avoid this recipe!",
