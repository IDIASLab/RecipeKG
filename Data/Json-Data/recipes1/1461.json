Three cups of flour is probably to blame since the rosemary and tomatoes did not fully drown out the floury taste. I've since tried another recipe that used two cups of flour which worked much better. For what it's worth I do not have a bread machine so I mixed this by hand and cooked it on a pizza stone. Still I doubt that would affect the dryness.",
