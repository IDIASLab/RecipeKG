This recipe is an excellent example of classic, authentic, delicious Mexican food.  Before you make it and then give it a low rating for not having enough flavor, understand that this is basically a beef stew.  Just because it is authentic mexican doesn't mean it is supposed to be spicy. As long as you expect the right thing, you won't be disappointed.  For those of you near-the-southern-border people looking to make your favorite taco/burrito meat at home, this recipe is great.  You can make it spicy if you want to, of course - but don't give the recipe a bad rating...it's VERY good!",

I added alot more cumin. I also have never had it over rice or noodles. Dont think I'll be trying it that way anytime soon. But this recipe gave me the ground work to make my own now that I live in New York. I suggest putting it in flour tortillas and topping it with shredded chedder ( I thought the cheese would be gross until everyone insisted I try it its the best way to eat it ).",

Generally good Mexican food retaurants in south Texas are judged on two simple, but hard to get right standards - enchiladas and carne guisada. Guisada is an all around food - you can usually order it in breakfast tacos or as a plate.\r\n\r\nA couple of recommendations - more garlic powder, cumin, pepper, and I added some Lawry's seasoned salt as well. Taste as you go once you add the water. Also to give it a more authentic taste, add a can of Rotel Mexican Festival tomatos and chiles. This will definitely spice it up and add a hint of lime and cilantro which is so present in most south Texas cooking. Also, eat it like we do in Texas and serve on corn or flour tortillas with guacamole and cheese for inside fixins. I think you'll be much more pleased than over rice or noodles.

First we seasoned the meat and dredged the pieces in Bisquick. Then we browned them in the fry pan. We added beef broth instead of water lime juice spicy taco seasoning red wine roasted garlic juice and plenty of it more onions red pepper flakes and also had to simmer this tough cut of beef 2 hours. THEN we mixed in some Doritos Rancheros corn chips with hot cooked elbow macaroni stirred it together with the meat mixture and sprinkled some extra sharp chedar cheese on top. We threw it in the broiler for 3-5 minutes till the cheese was browning and it was very good. FAR too much 'tweaking' to give this recipe more than the minimum \"One Star\"",
