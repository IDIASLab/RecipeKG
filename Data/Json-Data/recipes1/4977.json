Instead of using wild rice and plain cheddar cheese I used the instant microwaveable Mexican rice and Mexican blend cheese for the filling. Likewise I added a little chili powder and salsa to the filling to give it a little more of a kick. Finally instead of potato flakes or corn flakes I coated the stuffed breasts in bread crumbs mixed with a little taco seasoning (from the packets you can buy at grocery stores). My family and I really enjoyed it!",

I used the leftover filling as a side dish (see pic). I would add some chili powder. For the roasted chili I held a jalapeno over the burner to roast and then I deseeded it and chopped. Perhaps next time I will add a tad of cream cheese to the filling and make spicier. Though I don't know if I\"ll make this again.",
