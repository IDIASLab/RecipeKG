(Of course I didn't add the cinnamon when adding chips) I used a mini ice cream scoop to drop cookies on sheets then after 10 minutes of baking I flattened the puffed cookies slightly with an \"egg flipper\" then baked for 3 more minutes this made them super chewy inside and crispy on the edges absoulutely DELICIOUS just like the bakery this way! Thanks very much for the recipe Kristen!",

                "reviewBody": "Okay, so here's the thing. I wanted to use butter (I don't keep shortening on hand outside the Christmas season) but I didn't want to use a stick and a half so I used the servings adjuster thingie on this site and cut it back to twenty servings which made it one stick of butter (which is half a cup). I had to do a little monkey-ing around with a few of the ingredients to make them come out even, like I used one whole egg which meant I had to eliminate the water called for in this recipe. I also used a full teaspoon of vanilla and added a half cup or so of organic raisins. Even with my adjustments (or crazy changing to round amounts), this cookie baked up fabulous and didn't seem to be affected by my changes. That's a sign of a wonderful recipe--it dosen't fall flat when you change up the recipe a bit. The cookie was perfectly cinnamon-y and it was chewy with a slight crisp on the edges. I like my oatmeal cookies soft usually but I really liked the flavors of this. I'll make this recipe again, but I'll make sure to make a custom recipe so I remember the changes I made to suit 20 servings or using one stick of butter. NOTE: GREASE YOUR SHEETS. Trust me. Otherwise, you'll have a hard time getting these cookies off of the cookie sheets. Also, 350* for eleven and a half minutes was just right.",

The recipe is simple enough my children are able to follow most of the instructions independently. I found the dough to be quite soft - a little wet even; but the finished product was outstanding. I baked the cookies on ungreased parchment paper lined cookie sheets and had no problems with sticking or spreading. For the final batch I stirred in Orchard Trail Mix available at Wal-Mart and the cookies maintained their shape and consistency despite the fairly large yogurt covered raisins and cashews in the mix. I would reduce the cinnamon to 1 tsp. in the future if I were planning to add raisins nuts or trail mix. This recipe has joined the gang posted on the back of my cabinet door and will be made often.",
