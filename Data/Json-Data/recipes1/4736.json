I like dishes with plenty of flavor and of course garlic is a must of me.  Here are some changes that I made and it worked out great. I pounded out the chicken to an even thickness.  Added 2 cloves crushed garlic to the green onions and butter.  I grated probably 3/4 of a cup of fresh parm.  Added salt and pepper along with the italian seasoning to the fresh grated parm cheese mixture. Instead of 1/2 C milk, I did 1 C of a milk and sour cream mixed. I mixed with more sour cream than milk just as long as it totalled 1 Cup.  I added a pinch of cayanne pepper and salt to the milk mixture during the simmering phase.  I put the whole 10oz pkg of frozen spinach and I also added to that a whole package of sauteed mushrooms that I had sauteed in butter and salted.  I also substituted the pimentoes for roasted red peppers as did someone else in the reviews.  I ended up putting in about 1/2 cup of chopped roasted red peppers in with the spinach and mushrooms.  Because there was plenty of vegetables in the mixture, I didn't serve with a side dish of veggies, just a side of herb roated potato pieces.  Yum.",

I added some breadcrumbs to the parmesan cheese coating mixture and sauteed some garlic in with the butter for the sauce and added some salt & pepper as well.  I omitted the onions (we don't like them) and the pimentos (didn't have any).  I also pounded the chicken out to about 3/4 inch so it was uniform in thickness.  I baked the chicken alone for 15 minutes and then put the spinach mixture on top for the last 15 minutes so it wouldn't dry out.  That worked very well.  I will definitely make this again!",

I chopped up some fresh baby spinach (instead of the frozen) and sauteed it in the water left on the leaves from washing, then drained and set aside until I was ready to add it to the sauce as instructed. I used real grated parmesan (bought a block and grated it). mmmmm ... and cooked fettucine on the side. I put some butter/garlic/basil on the fettucine, then added the leftover sauce once I took the chicken out of the baking dish. YUM!",

I keep a container with half salt and half sugar and before I cook a I place my chicken or pork in a zip lock bag with a few tablespoons of the mixture and then add water.  I let it sit at least an hour.  If you do this you will never have dried out pork or chicken again. Most brine recipes are more complex that this but it works perfectly.",
