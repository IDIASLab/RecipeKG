You have to work with it really quickly or it will harden up to a point where it will not spread. It does not harder up to the point of being candy. The good thing is that if you get a pot of boiling water beside you and a metal icing spatula heat the spatula up in boiling water dry it off before touching the cake with it go over the lumps lightly and in one direction you can get it smoothed off. So get it on there the best you can and then use the previous method to fix any bumps. I definately will make this recipe again.",
