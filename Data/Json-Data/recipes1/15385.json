The only thing I changed was a added a splash of almond extract and a splash of vanilla extract.  Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, I too made this recipe without shortening the first few times.  I just put half butter and half vegetable oil.  It worked like a charm and it was a little easier to mix than plain shortening alone.",

I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to change a few things but I guess I got lucky because they were delicious! I had no shortening so I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup of half vegetable oil half whipping cream. Used sliced almonds instead of butterscotch chips and included 1/4 cup powdered almonds (removed 1/4 cup flour). Baked 23 minutes. I love how the orange coconut and almond flavors blended together the result smelled and tasted quite delicate and refined. Will make again.",

I added orange extract in place of the orange peel to give it a stronger orange taste about a tsp. And added about a 1/2 tsp. Or so of almond extract. I also substituted the butterscotch chips for white chocolate chips. My son do sent like coconut and my husband doesn't like white chocolate anything. They couldn't keep their hands off of them. This has now become one of my favorite bar recipes. Dried cranberries would add a festive touch to them and go fantastic with the orange and coconut flavor!",
