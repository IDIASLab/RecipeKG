I used butter rather than shortening and it worked well. Also make sure to toast the pecans before adding them in since that really brings out their flavor. Finally I'd recommend pre-mixing the nuts gumpdrops oatmeal and coconut together before adding these ingredients into the dough... otherwise you have to stir the dough too much in the end and the cookies aren't quite as tender.

These gumdromps are small so all you have to do is snip them in two with a pair of scissors very quick! I used margarine instead of shortening and the cookies came out fine. Also I flatten them slightly with a spatula just as they come out of the oven while still on the bakingn sheet I find this makes them chewier (is that even a word?)then I remove them to cool as directed. Exactly as I remember from childhood thanks for sharing an excellent recipe.",

I used chopped gumdrop orange slices in this that I had bought for another project and didn't end up using. I'm not a huge gumdrop fan but they're good in this. I will probably use the recipe over and over with different additions though replacing the gumdrops with dried fruit or another candy. The base cookie is excellent crispy and chewy perfectly sweet.
