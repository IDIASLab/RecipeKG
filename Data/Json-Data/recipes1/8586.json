Line a cookie sheet with foil, shiny side DOWN. Put the pecans in a single layer. Bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 5 minutes. Turn the pecans over with pancake turner and bake for another 5 minutes, or until they become fragrant. Do the same for the oats, spreading them out as thinly as possible on the cookie sheet. I then chopped the pecans and oats by pulsing them together in the food processor. Toasting results in a fabulous, toffee-like flavor. Makes these extraordinary. You can toast a pound of pecans on a single 11\"X17\" cookie sheet, then freeze after cooling so they're ready whenever you want to bake these cookies. Ditto for the oats. Bag them in 1-1/2 cup portions in a zip-lock sandwich baggie for convenience. No need to even thaw them before incorporating them in the dough. Everyone loves these. They will make your reputation as a baker. Thank you!",

The dough, without pecans and only 3/4 C. ea of the sugars, was so dry and would not stick together I had to check to be sure I hadn't missed a wet ingredient somewhere. It was so tough I could not use tablespoons but had to roll the dough in my hands to create a round-ish shape. By the end of the second batch I ended up with 2/3 cup oats and chips leftover in the bowl with no dough to hold it together. I could make them again for the taste but I don't feel like trying to figure out what to adjust so I'll just forget this recipe. Thanks anyway.",

I thought that this recipe sounded familiar and the words \"disappearing cookies\" tipped me off. This is almost identical to the Quaker Oats Vanishing Oatmeal Cookie recipe. The main difference is this one has more white sugar has baking powder and the flour & oat amounts are reversed. If you don't grease the pan the cookies won't spread. I think next time I will use the Quaker oat recipe instead. I like cookies with more oats and one reviewer did comment that these were too sweet and maybe the cinnamon will add to the flavor.",
