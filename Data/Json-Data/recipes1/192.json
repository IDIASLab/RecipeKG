I bake these on an UNGREASED aluminum cookie sheet and use an extremely thin metal spatula to remove.  I then cool on a rack before frosting.  Once cooled, over the sink, I brush off all excess crumbs from bottom of each cookie.  This step is necessary, as I find that by the cookie sheet being ungreased, a very fine layer of the bottom of each cookie will adhere to the sheet (being that my memory of New York Black & Whites has always been a completely uncrisp cookie, this serves to achieve that result). Regarding the frosting, I actually make it in 2 batches, white being first: 3 Cups confectioners sugar, 2 Tbsp light corn syrup (for consistency), 1 TBSP butter (for shine), 1 1/2 tsp clear imitation vanilla extract, and enough hot water to achieve desired consistency. I mix with a wire whisk until smooth.  I then ice slightly over 1/2 of each cookie and let set until firm (approx. 20 mins.).  For black icing: follow recipe for white however add to it 1/4 to 1/3 C. DUTCH processed cocoa powder (believe me, no other cocoa, chocolate or chocolate flavoring will do - I've tried them all!). I frost cookie by spooning on icing, then using a small offset spatula to smooth.  If it appears that I am obsessed with these cookies, I am! It may take a few additional minutes longer overall, but I have to sa",

Okay, so it was many years ago, but I remember the taste well!  After I tried this recipe, I knew that it was on the right track but needed just a few minor adjustments.  So, after the third time, here is what I came up with: increase lemon extract to 1 tsp., decrease all-purpose flour to 2 1/4 cups, and increase salt to 3/4 tsp.  Also, I initially tried the bittersweet chocolate in the frosting but found that using melted semi-sweet chocolate tasted more like what I was used to.  I didn't measure the amount; just added it to taste (I would guess, about 4-5 ozs.!).  Rather than dropping batter by tablespoons, I used 1/4-1/3 of a cup, then used the back of a spoon to swirl it into a nicely formed circle about 1\" thick. Bake for about 11-14 minutes.  This method results in the typical bakery size cookies.  Overall, I would give this recipe 4 stars - VERY close to the original!",

For those of you who are sick and tired of trying to find the recipe for your grandmother's black and white (or half-moon) cookies, THIS IS IT. This recipe is the same as the one from Zabar's and it's wonderful. \r\nSome reviewers felt that it didn't taste lemony enough- you MUST use pure lemon extract. It makes a world of difference. You can add a few extra drops if you'd like.\r\nI agree with the people who said you should  spread/flatten them on your cookie sheet before baking. I use the back of a big spoon to shape and flatten it. Parchment paper helps as well.\r\nIf you're looking for a fun way to decorate these cookies, use different colors of food coloring for the vanilla frosting side.",

I used hoosier2b's suggestions for the flour lemon salt and chocolate icing adjustments- the cookies were big and baked up fluffy and cakelike just like they should! WATCH them in the oven-- they're done right around 11 minutes when the edges are just starting to turn golden. The icing won't bleed or look messy if you apply the white first and let it dry completely before applying the chocolate. Make sure that your icing remains warm while you're putting it on the cookies: it's easier to spread on and will dry shiny just like the ones in the bakery!",

I ran out of confectioner's sugar and ended up melting both white and dark chocolate chips for the frosting which actually was a big hit. I almost burned the first batch though. I had to turn the heat down to 325 degrees and only baked them for 9 minutes-they were perfectly golden brown. A must-make!",
