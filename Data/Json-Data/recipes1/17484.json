It takes less time and cooks evenly. I don't toss my onions in the bacon grease just sprinkle them over the salad before adding the hot dressing. I only use about 2 Tbsp. of the bacon fat and add about 1/4 apple cider vinegar ground black pepper and sugar (to taste we like it pretty sweet). Heat until the sugar dissolves in the vinegar and bacon fat. Pour hot mixture over the greens and enjoy. It's less fat and gives it a little bite from the vinegar although it does add sugar to the mix. It's delicious.",

My grand mother who has now long passed away, could not wait til \"leaf Lettuce\" was in season to make this, I can still Smell the bacon,onions,vinager.. Every time I make this, it takes me back to her kitchen...Oh how I miss her.. She was a wonderful cook and a wonderful person. How I wished I had written down all her personal recipes! I can't give measurement bc she/we cook my sight and feel, sorry....(Just go with it). A few things she did different....Leaf Lettuce, cut up(schedded by hand)green onions, fry bacon,drain grease keep warm(hot), Mix lettuce,crumbled bacon. green onion,vinegar, salt ,pepper to taste in a bowl. Make sure your bacon grease is very warm(hot) pour over mixture until\"wilted\". Its kinda like a oil, vinegar spinach salad BUT SO MUCH better. My family moved from West Virgina to Flordia in 1956, So where did the recipe come from I don't know. But I do rememmber my Great Aunts( Grandmothers sisiters) talking about eating this when they were childern in WV, early 1900's. I wished I knew the full history behind this dish, And oh how I miss my gradmother........",
