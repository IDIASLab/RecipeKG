Cream of tartar is what is added as a \"raising agent\" in most Angel Food type recipes. When this cake is baked it should have yellow and white alternating areas like an \"Unswirled\" marble cake. If you have never made an Angel Food Cake I would advise you to do some reading about them before attempting this wonderful recipe.",

I'd never done something like that before. No worries though I just made it harder in my head.:) It took a little bit of time to put together but the end result is worth it. I didn't use a seven minute frosting only because I don't care for it so I used a stabilized whipped cream frosting. Lovely cake. Thanks for the recipe.",
