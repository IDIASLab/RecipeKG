I made it for dinner at a large family gathering for 16- from ages 1 to 6- and everyone loved it. They all wanted the leftovers for lunch the next day but there wasn't any. I used canned diced tomatoes a little more tomato paste than it called for and also a large can of crushed tomatoes. Simmered it on low in a crock pot and it was fabulous. It will be made for Italian dinners in my house all the time even for just the two of us. Sooo easy and absolutely delicious!",

(Pat's sauteed mushrooms from this site) I make lots of sauce and double the meat and freeze it for other recipes (lasagnas etc) that call for canned spaghetti sauce because it is ten times better!
