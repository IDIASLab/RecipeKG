Even following his recommendations it was still bland. I would also add a generous amount of frozen peas at the end of the cooking time to help offse the blandness. The meat turned out great. Don't worry about the sauce being too watery - the pasta will suck it all in and it will actually turn out a bit dry. I'll use less pasta next time.",
