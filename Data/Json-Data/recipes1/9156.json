I prefer real butter and vanilla but margarine and vanilla flavoring will work. Cooking just short of the soft ball stage and beating in the dates and nuts with a wooden spoon makes it a bit creamier. Toasted pecans are our preferred nuts for this. I also use 1 1/2 cups of dates. My Grandmother made this every year until she couldn't then my Mother took over. I inherited it when my Mom passed away. I am now teaching my daughter and daughter-in-law the tricks to making this wonderful candy.",
