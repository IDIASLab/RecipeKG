                "reviewBody": "This recipe is similar to one I've had for a couple of years. My comments are as follows: the butter should be melted and cocoa added to that. This cooks the cocoa (like when you boil cocoa to drink).Take off the heat and then put in the sugar. Sugar should not be mixed while the fire is on because it will caramelize and spoil the whole mix. The sugar will still be in granules but that doesn't matter because that gives the brownies top its crust.I think 7 eggs refers to medium sized eggs, while most of us are used to using large eggs for baking.It's okay to add the eggs after this because the sugar has cooled the mix and the eggs won't get accidentally cooked.Should you find the batter slightly lumpy after adding the flour,simply press it against the side of the saucepan with a large wooden spoon to dissolve the lumps.If your oven tends to be a bit hot, reduce the temperature and cook a bit longer. This also reduces the cakey texture.For those who do not like the thickness, simply use a bigger pan. All obstacles overcome, this recipe is really a winner.Enjoy. :-)",

I'm a fan of fudgey, gooey brownies (if I want cake, I'll make a Devil's Food, not brownies).  Like many folks, I tweaked this recipe.  \r\n\r\n*6 eggs instead of 7.  Next time I'll try 5 as these were still a tad cakey.\r\n\r\n*I added 2 oz unsweetened baking chocolate to the butter when I melted it.  I thought it was wrong to make brownies only using cocoa powder.  Initially, I eliminated 1/4 c. of the cocoa powder, but then I added it anyway.  The brownies were decadently rich...although, in my mind, the words \"chocolate\" and \"overkill\" are mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\n* I used a 9x13 pan, made a sleeve of aluminum foil, and put the pan in an ice bath immediately after I removed it from the oven (you could also pop it in the freezer, but my freezer was full).  The brownies slowly sunk, making them much more dense than they would normally have been.  The ice bath also gives you that nice sheen on the top of the brownies.  The aluminum foil peeled off the brownies quite easily, without any oil or spray.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I liked it.  I'll probably still tinker with it a bit, but it's a great start!",

Quick and easy to make chewy and full of flavor! I took others' advice and used a larger pan (once you try the recipe you'll see exactly why) used PAM only (no foil) added 6 eggs instead of 7 and allowed the sugar/butter mixture to cool down before adding the eggs. I also sprinkled powdered sugar on top of the cooked brownies. they only took 30 minutes in the oven. Make sure you keep an eye on them or they'll overcook and those moist brownies you were craving will go right out the window.;) This recipe is definitely a keeper!",

Ok after my 20 years of baking here is my advice let the butter stand at room temperature until very soft then you can use that in the mix you do not have to have the butter melted all the way but you do have to have the butter very soft or just stick the butter in the microwave for 30 seconds or so just until very soft then mix the butter with the rest of the ingredients also you do not want to over mix the batter thats a NO NO. Follow the rest of the recipe and brownies will come out just fine I promise you.",

Stir in 1 1/4 cups flour, then 1 cup nuts (I prefer pecans).\n6. Pour batter into non-stick 9x13 pan.  No need to use foil, parchment, or even non-stick spray.\n7. Bake in preheated oven (350 F) for 45 minutes.  I covered mine with foil the last 10 minutes.\n\nCool briefly on cooling rack and serve warm.  Cuts into perfect squares.  It's a great standard brownie recipe!  Lovely texture and taste. It would be excellent with a vanilla ice cream topped with a chocolate ganache. Thank you.",

I am a big lover of chocolate and so is my sister, and we could hardly eat the one piece. It just becomes too overwhelming and sickly after just a few bites, I will not be making this again.",
