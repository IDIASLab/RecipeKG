Hot (with some homemade croutons) or cold with sour cream on top this is a winner.",

Just a bit a spiciness and the tang of some fresh lemon juice in the sour cream and a little more on the soup. I did use fresh peas instead of snap peas. IF you use a Vitamix to blend the ingredients you don't need to strain BUT be careful blending/ chopping.  DONT overdo it and add too much air to the soup. It becomes more like whip than soup.
