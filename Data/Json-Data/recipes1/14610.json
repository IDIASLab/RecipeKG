I double the garlic, cut the butter in half, and only use 1 3/4 c milk to avoid the sauce getting too runny. I've made it with and without soy sauce and it's good either way. My favorite modification has been a few red pepper flakes for an added kick.  So good!!! I will definitely be making this again and again :)",

I cooked the mushrooms in the butter and oil (and cooked them until they were completely soft...about 8 minutes).  I added 4 cloves of garlic and used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 1 cup of 1% milk (because that's what I had).  Lastly, I squeezed the water out of the spinach and chopped it finely. I was reluctant to use the soy sauce because it seemed like a strange combo.  DON'T leave it out!  It gives the dish it's wonderful and different flavor.",

I'll keep it in next time; with the added cheese it could have been a tad 'wetter.' Triple the garlic... absolutely! It would have been so much less without the extra garlic! Add Parm (1/4 cup) and Monterey Jack (a handful shredded) to the sauce. Add Sun-Dried Tomatoes (maybe 6 or 7, sliced)... we loved this... also great with the addition of roasted red peppers. Add black pepper... will add some cayenne next time. Top with additional Mozz AND Parm.  I've made this three times already and my entire family went nuts over it... even the so-called mushroom-hating and spinach-hating members.  This is one heck of a recipe and I wouldn't hesitate to serve it to company. Many thanks, chmadden! ",

The recipe doesn't state but I did wring the excess water from the spinach. My sauce was still just the right consistency...I think it would have been too runny if I hadn't done that. I used part-skim mozzarella and 1% milk and it turned out fine. Only substitution I made was parsley for basil since I'm not a basil fan. Thanks!",

The soy sauce IS the recipe. Without it, it is just a regular cream sauce.\nBut I agree that you do have to wring the spinach out which the recipe does not mention.\nI followed the recipe except that I added a little more flour to make sure the sauce was thick enough and I mixed all the cheese in instead of putting it ontop.\nWhen I make it agian I will make it with less spinach.\nJust a heads up though- becuse of the soy and the spinach it is not that great to look at.

I made a few minor changes - used some random pasta I had (not penne) replaced the soy sauce with some salt and added a extra cup of water to the sauce because it was too thick. It is very important to simmer the flour for a few minutes (stirring) before pouring the liquid in - that will give it more thickness. I'll certainly make it again!",
