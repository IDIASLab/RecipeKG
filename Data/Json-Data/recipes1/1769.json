Butter cakes have a tendency to be dry--not this one.  Think the best wedding cake you ever had--now think three times as good as that, and that's how I'd describe this cake. Beautiful texture and color, substantial yet delicate crumb. This could easily be adapted to other flavors as well. I made no changes--the recipe stands on its own. I filled it with \"Lemon Curd,\" from this site, and frosted it with my own vanilla buttercream. Outstanding! ",

The layers baked up evenly and did not fall in the middle. This recipe is great for a moist sturdy cake with natural flavor.",

I'm a lemon fanatic and I found the lemon flavor not to be very pronounced as I would have like. I added 1.5-2 Tbsp lemon zest and 1 tsp lemon extract but it didn't explode with lemon flavor as I had hoped. Either way it will definitely be a delicious new addition to my repertoire and I will try it again tweaking to get that perfect punch of lemon and probably some other flavorings.

Also, no need for cake flour or parchment paper (if you spray the pan down well with no stick spray, it'll be just fine). I am kinda disappointed since I've been trying to find a good lemon or lemon poppyseed recipe with a good lemon flavor. The only thing that affected my decision was the lemon flavor. If you aren't a big fan of lemon and are looking for a sweet cake with a very light lemon flavor, this is the cake for you! I will frost one of the cakes tomorrow with lemon frosting - 1 c powdered sugar, 1 tsp milk, 1 tsp vanilla, 1-2 T butter, melted, lemon juice to taste, mix all ingredients until slightly runny - and it should be better.",
