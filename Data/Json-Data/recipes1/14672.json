I was very pleasantly surprised given the short list of ingredients, and expected these to be dry once prepared....however, they were very flavorful and enjoyed by all my family, including my picky 1&1/2 year old toddler! I doubled the recipe to make 8 tuna burgers. I did not have tuna pouches, so used 2, 5 ounce cans of tuna. I used 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp each of salt and pepper. I was concerned after mixing all the other ingredients that adding the day-old bread would dry these patties out too much, so I omitted that ingredient. I fried the mixture by 1/4 cupful and flattened in the frying pan. They cooked up beautifully about 2-3 minutes on each side. This will become a regular menu item in this house! Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!",
