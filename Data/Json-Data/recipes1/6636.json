I add garlic to just about everything and so I added some chopped garlic to this; I also added a couple of cilantro leaves and some dried thyme. I did not bake it as a pie but rather served myself the prepared meat/vegetable mixture/gravy mixture with 2 of my biscuits (which I buttered) on the side. TOTALLY DELICIOUS. A phenominal COMFORT FOOD experience; an absolutely \"guilty pleasure\" that I will definitely make again (and keep to myself).",
