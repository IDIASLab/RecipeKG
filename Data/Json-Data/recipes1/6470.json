It was meant to be eaten with our holiday meal but everyone went back for seconds as a dessert. Everyone was raving and I could not have been more thrilled to have been compared to my grandmother as a terrific cook.  Thank you Lisa!!",

I arranged it all in the bowl wrapped it in clear celophane paper (like you use on an Easter basket) then tied it with a big raffia bow. I printed the \"halfed\" recipe on pretty holiday recipe cards punched a hole in the corner and tied it into the bow. They looked so pretty under my Christmas tree and all my friends loved them.
