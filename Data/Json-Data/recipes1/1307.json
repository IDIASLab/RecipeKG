I will definitely make this again I do think that frosting this with a rich chocolate frosting will take away from the mildnes in this cake compete too much with the flavor. I used Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting from the site and it really complimented the cake. Thanks for the recipe (:",

I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using cake flour but one would think the cake flour would make it more fluffy. So 4 stars for the taste but had to subtract one for the texture.",
