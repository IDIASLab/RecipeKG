The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden-brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.",

She told me this was an important dish to know as it is tasty, very economical and you can clean out the fridge using up leftovers.  Boy was she right!  It is GREATt just as is.. all on its own.  During the summer, when our garden is overflowing, I sometimes add some grape tomatoes, eggplant or some zucchini and my favorite  - fresh basil!  I have made this using leftover chicken cutlets I diced up and made my food budget stretch a little farther.  Be sure to watch the garlic cooking time and be aware that there is some cooking water from the pasta that is to be added to the garlic when it is finished browning.  It is mentioned in the video and my MIL made SURE I knew to do that as it adds necessary moisture to the sauce.  I use at least a full ladle as I like it a bit more moist.  NOTE:  add the water slowly to avoid splattering! I made this last night and I added a cup of diced grape tomatoes and some crumbled bacon and topped with shredded fresh spinach.  Perfect summer meal.  My favorite is using sun dried tomatoes, spinach and fresh mozzarella.  Can't go wrong with this recipe!",

This is important and is missing from the recipe.  This stops the garlic from over cooking and getting bitter and it also adds that extra moisture to the sauce.  I usually reserve some pasta water 'just in case'.   This recipe says it serves 4 but as a side dish ( which I did) it would easily serve 8 or even more.  I served this with sauteed green beans with prosciutto and Barber Chicken, Parmesan.  (I know, cheating but it was really good!) Enjoy!",

For example, I add the parsley and chili flakes to the oil after the garlic has browned, and then also add a ladle of spaghetti water as it's cooking.\r\n\r\nI usually forgo the cheese, simply because it's expensive back home in Canada and not readily available here in Tanzania. In place of it, I fancy it up with vegetables, either a handful of long green beans or asparagus. Both add a wonderful oomph to the dish. I add the veg once the garlic has browned, but before the pasta water.",

I tossed in some fresh steamed broccoli, which I found went good with this pasta. 8-17-2018: Still a very tasty recipe, but have found we prefer it with less oil. I reduce the amount of oil by half of what's called for. If you add in broccoli, I find a saute with fresh or roasted fresh broccoli brings out more flavor.",
