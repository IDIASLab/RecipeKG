The only things I changed was due to it being too tangy I added 1/4 cup white granulated sugar I omitted the salt and worcestershire sauce and added 1 tablespoon minced garlic instead. I let it simmer for about 45 mins and it turned out great! Thanks for a great recipe...I will be making this again!",

Tangy flavor zesty with some zing but not too spicy or sweet or tomatoey a nice blend of all. I scaled this back to 1 lb of beef. I used 2 Tbl dried minced onion and 2 heaping Tbl. of diced pimento pepper in the jar Head Country bbq sauce which didn't have hickory so I put in a couple of drops of mesquite liquid smoke (the only kind I had on hand). I used about a half tsp of sea salt 1/4 tsp celery salt and 5 or 6 grinds of black pepper and a tsp of paprika to go with the pimento since I didn't use fresh sweet red pepper. I buttered the buns and grilled them til they were toasty and golden topped with sloppy joe filling and a slice of american cheese this made a nice filling lunch and I had plenty of leftovers for another meal. These were even better after I reheated the leftovers. I almost gave this a 5 based on what I reheated but the original recipe only says to cook these a few minutes and they certainly would not really compare with my final product. Fabulous recipe I'll certainly use this again. Thanks so much for posting this one!",
