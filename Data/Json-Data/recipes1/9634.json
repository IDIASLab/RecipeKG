I found a similar recipe online by Alton Brown and I merged the two and ended up with following changes. Used the Graham Cracker Crust I recipe from this site. Substituted Cream of coconut (from the alcoholic beverage aisle) for the orange juice concentrate and the maple syrup. Used a 1/4 cup rice milk and 1/4 cup chocolate liquor (creme de cocoa could use any liquor i.e. coffee orange etc). Lastly I increased the chocolate chips to 1.5 cups and tofu to 12 oz. Filled the crust perfectly and set very nicely very creamy and very flavorful!",
