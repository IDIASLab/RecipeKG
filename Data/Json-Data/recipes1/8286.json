So simple and tastes wonderful (especially hot out of the oven with some butter)!  We did have a bit of a problem with the first rising, but our electric oven wasn't warm enough. A quick warming and they rose nicely!  We are already coming up with ideas for garlic bread, herb bread, cheese bread, and whatever else we can think of!  Thanks for sharing this one!",
