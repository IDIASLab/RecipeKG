Dried cherries on the other hand sounded like an appealing alternative. I plumped the cherries in boiling water for about 15 minutes and I liked how that turned out. The bread rose well and came out nicely rounded. It was moist and certainly not short on either cherries or nuts. But it kind of reminded me of what a golf teacher remarked to me many years ago. Your swing is beautiful he said. I can t figure out why you re not hitting the ball. Similarly in this case everything was right. I just can t figure out why it was so lacking in flavor. It was more nutty tasting than anything else the batter itself fairly tasteless. A little cinnamon maybe or some almond extract would probably help. So yawn. Three stars. And had I made it with the full jar of maraschino cherries? Too sweet. Too maraschino cherry-y. Still three stars.",

I soured milk by using vinegar and it worked just as good as the buttermilk. I think next time i would add even more cherries as my family loves them. I did nopt chop the cherries into small pieces but just halved them instead. Made for nice chunks of fruit and looked very pretty. Oh yeah i had to cook this for almost 70 minutes and it was a large sized loaf. Still came out very moist. Great recipe!!",
