The first time I made these muffins I followed the recipe to a T, although after making it the third time I felt that they were becoming to sweet tasting, and I found they were a bit high in cals.  So to make them into healthy blueberry muffins I substituted 1/4 of the butter with unsweetened applesauce, added wheat flour instead of the white (which is bad for the body), and I cut down on the sugar to 1 cup and less two tbsp. and added 1 tsp. of vanilla and it turned out great!!! Based on my backround in nutirtion I advise these substitutes!! anyway, its overall the best recipe in the world.....I have tried all the others on this site but this is \"#1\" :)*****(*)",

I now understand the \"cake-like\" reference - they come out dense, moist, and filling, not fluffy like I was looking for.  They taste delicious, however.  I only put a cup of sugar instead of 1 1/4 and it came out just right - I don't like my muffins to be super sweet.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, except that I reserved 1/4 of the flour to coat the blueberries so as to avoid them popping during cooking.",

                "reviewBody": "This is a classic muffin recipe in its ratios of sugar, fat, egg, and flour.  The generation of cake muffins that most people come to expect didnt come around until the advent of betty crocker muffin mixes.  So yes, it is soft, and very simple in ingredients ie: no lemon, orange rind, spices, etc.  It is a delightful recipe similar to one in my mothers 1919 cookbook.    Two things to note:  muffin papers didn't exist when muffins came about.  They developed a nice brown crust in the iron and steel pans they were cooked in.  Do yourself a favor and make a traditional muffin in the traditional way and enjoy the golden crust that held the muffin together.  The last thing to note:  muffin recipes use baking soda and that means they really bake best with higher heat.  425F is the magic number for muffins.  First it sets the crust quickly which controls the \"spread\" and forces the muffin up into a pretty crown.  The creation of mushroom shaped muffins is a modern thing.  So crank up the oven to 425 when you make this recipe and they cook for about 12 minutes.  By doing that you can have a muffin that is 2/3 full and have a nice crown.  Love the recipe!",

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added 1tsp of vanilla, and I cut the sugar to just 1cup, but I totally could have handled the entire amount....I have a raging sweet tooth, though.  Even though I cut the sugar, that's not to say that these weren't sweet.  They were absolutely decadent!!!  I HIGHLY recommend making this recipe!!!!",

They're not an old-fashioned muffin in the traditional sense mind you more cake like...but darned good cake. I added a teaspoon of vanilla (cake should have vanilla right?) but other than that I stuck to the recipe. I got eight Texas-sixed muffins and I had enough of that wonderful brown sugar oatmeal topping for all of them. When/if I make these again I'll probably make them exactly the same way!",

I was very disappointed in the appearance, but the flavor was good, but a little sugary or grainy.  I probably won't make these again.",
