The second time I made it I increased the vanilla and decreased the lemon. I think if you complete omit the lemon it would be too plain. When I made it the last time I used apple and pear because they are in season. Still delicious. It is a really simple recipe that just gets better as it sits in the fridge. Thank you Chef John!",
