Hubby thought it was just ok.  It has a nice tang from the vinegar and sour cream. The first time I make a recipe, I always make it exactly as written. I would suggest not trying to mash these by hand...it was next to impossible.  I even tried my hand mixer and the veggies were very hard to mash. Next time I will use my food processor. I cooked the frozen veggies for well over the 15 mins stated. I think next time I will also use fresh veggies instead. They tend to mash a lot easier and don't retain as much water as frozen veggies. When I first threw in the ingredients, everything was very watery. Once mixed though, it tends to thicken up. I enjoyed the flavor and found the amount of seasonings to be just right.  This is great for my low carb diet!",
