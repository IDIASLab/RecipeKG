I have never been a whole wheat fan, but as I'm getting older and realize how important nutrition really can be, expecially with diabetes in the family, I am trying to just make better choices  when possible and using less white flour and sugar is one of the big ones.  This was my first whole wheat baking experience and I have to say they were not only much better than I thought they would be, they were FANTASTIC!  I will be makng these often.   Next time I may add flax seeds and/or protein power to add a little extra umph...probably won't even be able to tell",

To make them more healthy I used (for 3 servings) one egg white instead of the egg, 1.5 Tbsp applesauce instead of the oil, and skim milk. As others mentioned I added cinnamon and used a very ripe banana for mashing. With my substitutions the caloric content is about 195 calories per pancake and only 1g of fat, not bad! Thanks for the great recipe! I will be making these again!",

With most pancake recipes that use oatmeal, I let the batter sit on the counter for a bit before making the pancakes. My kids gobbled these up and asked for seconds! I didn't eat any myself, but they sure enjoyed them. I served them with Absolute Best Pancake Syrup, which is also from this site. There were a few leftover, so I froze them in freezer bags in two portions for my kids so all I have to do is heat them in the toaster the next morning. A+ recipe.",

Mine did rise up because of the amount of baking powder but the browning was definitely not as perfect looking or the shape. However my real issue is I thought they were sort of doughy in the inside almost sort of still wet despite being done. That was not what I expected. Also something about the banana taste I did not love. I have tried plain and wheat pancakes from the site but these were just not my favorite. I believe a ripe or very ripe banana is not right for this recipe. The banana flavor is dominant and it needs a very fresh one unlike most baked recipes with banana. I gave it 4 stars because they are fairly healthy and I am also sure none will go to waste. They seem like they can be re-heated like most pancakes. They may even dry out a little by the next day. I made 1/2 recipe and got 5 med-large pancakes.",
