It would make an excellent base for a green pork chilli if you wanted to add a couple of cans of white beans as well. Hominy would be a fun addition too. I will make this again and again. Mmmmmm.\n\nAlso, a note, if you can acquire Mexican oregano, your tastebuds will thank you. It has an amazing earthy flavour that you just can't replicate with anything else.",

For everyone who complained this recipe was bland next time add 8-16 oz of this Salsa Verde in your crockpot and watch your mouth explode with flavor at dinnertime. I substituted a bottle of Corona beer for the water. Second I omitted the tomatillos green chiles and jalapeno peppers and instead added 16 oz of Herdez Salsa Verde. I doubled the oregano to 2 tsp. I also added 2 T of fresh Key lime juice. (I kept the onions cillantro and garlic amounts as per the recipe). If you don't like super hot spicy then back down on the Salsa Verde and add it in 1/4 cup increments until you get the right level of heat for your personal preference. This pork had a complexity of flavors with the garlic salsa verde oregano lime juice cilantro and onions. I'm not a big pork fan but this turned out to be the best pork recipe I've ever fixed. Forget the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and find yourself some Herdez salsa verde instead. This recipe is a keeper. In fact I'm going to dig out a couple of more pork shoulders from the freezer to cook and freeze in smaller portions for making enchiladas tacos and burritos.",
