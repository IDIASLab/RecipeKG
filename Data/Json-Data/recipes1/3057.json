One person said they always order carrot cake in restaurants and this was by far superior. I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter and made it into a four layer cake (two 9\" pans and then cut each cake into two) with cream cheese icing between each layer (double a regular c.c. icing recipe). Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe. I've made it three times in the last two weeks(twice as a layer cake and once as cupcakes) and will be making it for many years to come!",
