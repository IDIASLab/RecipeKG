Mine did not turn out very smooth because I probably slightly undercooked the vegetables (they were soft but still had texture) plus not owning an immersion blender I tried using a hand mixer - I SHOULD have dragged out my food processor! But it was still delicious a lovely change from our usual side dish. I'd like to experiment with different herbs or spices next time maybe add a teeny drop of honey or even maple syrup like I do when I roast these vegetables together.",

The 8 medium and large sized parsnips weighed in at 2 pounds, and 8 ounces of baby carrots were used. We made the following \u2018tweaks\u2019: 2X snipped chives as listed, and added 2 tablespoons honey and a dash of nutmeg.
