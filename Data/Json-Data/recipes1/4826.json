I steamed the broccoli. Once chicken and broccoli were done, I mixed EVERYTHING together, poured in 8 x 8 baking dish.  I sprinkled cheese (however much you want)on top and doubled the bread crumb mixture.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of broccoli.  This was soooooo good!",

My chicken was well seasoned when I boiled it.  I used the 98% FF soup. I added about 1/2+ cup sour cream, chicken boullion granules, salt, pepper, garlic powder.  I put at least 1/2 cup cheese in the casserole itself then another 1/2 cup on top.  I ended up just stirring the broccoli, chicken, cheese and soup mixture all up together before putting it in the dish.  I used buttered Ritz crackers on top.  It was yummy and still very easy and fast since I keep chopped, cooked chicken in the freezer all the time.  I'll make it again!!",

I've never tried this with cream of broccoli soup, but use cream of mushroom instead.  I mix the soup, milk, black pepper, 1/2 tsp corriander, and 1 tsp garlic powder in a large bowl.  Then throw in the chicken, broccoli and some cheese to coat.  I use more chicken and cheese than called for, use crushed butter crackers instead of bread crumbs, and cook in a 9x13 dish.

I used Campbell's Chicken with Herbs soup intead of Cream of Broccoli, and added about 1/2 cup (maybe a little more) of sour cream, about a tablespoon of Mrs. Dash Original, about a tablespoon of McCormick Lemon & Herb Seasoning and about a teaspoon of poultry seasoning.  Per another review, I also added cheddar to the sauce and doubled the bread crumb mixture.  I served it over rice.  PERFECT!  Will make again and again!",

Once the onions caramelized and the chicken began to brown, I added my frozen broccoli to the skillet, reduced the heat and covered to let the veggies steam. After mixing together the soup and milk, I just poured it directly into the skillet, as well as the cheese. Once I let all of those flavors steep for a while, I put it all into a baking dish, topped with bread crumbs and then baked uncovered. Yep. This one's a keeper for life!!",

I noticed no change in taste.  Oh, and I made this today without baking it & have it in my frig for dinner later in the week. It's a great make-ahead dinner that bakes off beautifully. This is such a basic recipe, there are so many ways to enhance it depending on your tastes.  I add 2 tbsp of curry (and I don't even LIKE curry) and use mayo instead of the milk.  It's a great dish served over rice, my mother has made it for years and it's always been a family favorite.  You can use frozen broccoli in a pinch, or freshly steamed is even better.  As for the soup... I use whatever flavor I have in my cupboard.",
