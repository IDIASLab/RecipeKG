These taste exactly like the dumplings you get in any restaurant, thick and a little chewy and just heavenly.  I used cold butter as I didn't have any shortening and added garlic salt and onion powder to the flour, and I did have to use about 3/4 cup water instead of 1/4 cup.  Just a note to all the nay-sayers out there, these DO NOT rise like those Bisquick-type dumplings, that's not the kind of dumplings these are.  These are completely submerged in whatever sauce you cook them in and are more like giant doughy noodles, they are not ball-shaped and don't sit on top of your sauce and get fluffy and airy on the outside.  Please note this before trying the recipe so you won't have different expectations.\n1/17/12 - UPDATE: I recently won 1st place in a cook-off a local restaurant using this recipe in my Chicken & Dumplings entry. I never use shortening, using instead only real, unsalted butter and add a little salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to the mix before adding about a cup or so of water :-)",

The recipe is great although I found that I needed more like a half cup of water instead of 1/4 cup in order to get the dough to 'hold' together.
