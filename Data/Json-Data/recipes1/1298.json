I actually had to cook mine for 45 minutes on medium heat before it took on any color. The filling also has a sharper taste than caramel more like strong butterscotch and I personally didn't like the flavor combined with the vanilla extract. I would make the cookie recipe again but change the filling to 1 bag of caramels melted with 2 tbsp. water or cream. Easier and probably better-tasting.",
