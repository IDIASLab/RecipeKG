I used whole wheat spaghetti and my family loved it.  Use \"Nature's Sweet\" tomatoes or some type of sugar plum tomatoes - you really need quality tomatoes since this is such a major ingredient.  I used twice the amount of fresh cilantro.  Use 1-2 teaspoons of fresh basil - much better than dried.  I put about 1/4 the amount of sugar, based on another reviewer's recommendation and thought it was fine - probably didn't need any, actually.  I echo the other reviewer's rec of using high quality extra virgin olive oil. Also, definitely add chicken. I used fresh Parmesan as well - delicious touch. I served with some warm crusty sourdough bread and steamed broccoli and it was a perfect meal!  My husband, who usually prefers tomato ground beef sauce, loved this fresh recipe!",

When I went to get my tomatoes I found out that I only had one smallish tomato so I used that and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies that I had in my pantry. I think the green chilies were a nice addition since they brought a little bit of pop to the dish. And since I had to use canned tomatoes I left out the sugar. I will make this again.",
