Maybe my expectations were too high but my 3 daughters and I thought this was terrible. I followed the recipe exactly and it was bitter way too thick to drink and bland. If you like eating plain pumkin out of the can this recipe is for you. But if you prefere desserts with flavorful rich autumn tastes then you will be dissapointed. I even tried thinning the drink with more milk and adding sugar and it still made me want to gag. Oh well I love pumpkin so it was worth a try.",
