I added a bit more corn and I also added sliced carrot - it added a nice texture and added some body. I also used a boneless chicken breast (as many other people here seem to have done) and the flavor penetrated the chicken wonderfully. I found with the tomato sauce there was enough salt so I didn't add any salt. Also since the chicken was boneless I only let it simmmer for about half an hour instead of a full hour. All in all this recipe was a great simple solution to a fairly empty pantry and resulted in a delicious meal!",

With the addition of these this recipe was fabulous- and was really more like a thick chicken tortilla soup (w/out the tortillas- but those would have been good too). I also added a few other things: mushrooms celery some sliced carrots- and a little bit of Shiraz wine I needed to get rid of. I think the Shiraz added a nice touch- the veggies were good too but I think they could be left out. The really essential additions in my opinion were the LIME AVOCADO & CHEESE. I may have changed this into a whole new recipe but the basis was excellent- so I'm giving it a \"5\". This was yummy & quite filling all by itself. Next time I'd serve with warm corn tortillas and a salad. Thanks for the great recipe!:)",
