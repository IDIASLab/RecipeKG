It's not supposed to be folks, it's garlic wings, not hot wings.\nNow that that is out of the way.\nThese are some of the best wings I have EVER had. I took a bag of flash frozen wings and cooked them at 400-425 for 35 minutes. Removed the wings and brushed them with the sauce. Returned them to the oven for 10 more minutes, took them out and tossed them in the sauce and plated them. FREAKIN AWESOME! Do it, do it now!",

                "reviewBody": "To start, I first found this recipe on another food site several years ago, and I have used the recipe ever since. With that said, the original recipe was edited to adjust the amount of butter from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup, and included the amount of chicken pieces (wings) to use. The recipe here as written is bland and is a rating of 3 at best.  The edited version however is a 4 or 5.  My suggestion is to make as written if you like it bland or double the amount of seasonings if you prefer the amount of butter stated. If you opt to use 1/4 cup of butter use the amount of seasoning as written.  We love garlic so I tend to add pressed garlic into the mixture as the butter melts along with the rest of the seasonings.  I also find it important to mention that \"salt\" is a preference, but can be adjusted to taste. The seasoning is there but is lacking with the amount of butter stated.",
