I just made it again and the best thing with this recipe: use your favorites! I put corn in it instead of lima beans and I used jalape\u00f1os instead of chili peppers. I also made my own taco seasoning from a recipe on here (I think taco seasoning I) instead of the store package (I'm really big on my food being organic). I didn't add the ranch package either. Making my own seasoning made this even better than I could imagine! I love it with cheese and sour cream. Mmm it's my guilty pleasure. And since there's only 2 of us here this is enough for me to have dinner for a week or so it's so good I don't mind eating it for days on end!! My boyfriend who hates beans even loves it!:)",

I did not add the additional salt I used three cans of organic black beans that I rinsed and drained instead of pinto-lima-kidney beans. I made my own taco seasoning mix and ranch dressing mix (sans salt) and instead of water I used a low sodium beef broth. When I got all the ingredients mixed the soup looked a bit thin to me so I threw in two 14 oz. cans tomato sauce and two cans drained and rinsed white corn. This was nice to come home to after a long afternoon and we enjoyed it. I'll make this again with my changes.",
