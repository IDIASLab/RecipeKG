I do add a can of whole baby clams as well as the minced clams and I season with OLD BAY seasoning and minced onion. If I'm having company I will increase the sauce with more clam juice and add some tiger prawns and clams in the half shell. With some chopped parsley around the plate it makes a nice presentation. Also great with a squirt of lemon juice before serving.",

This is a thin version and a good basic recipe for altering t taste. I add about 2 tbsp. olive oil loads of flat-leaf parsley finely chopped about 1/4 cup. The herby green flavour of the parsley is a delicious contrast to the briny clams. A splash of white wine is good idea. This has been a familly favourite for years. Thanks for your version JANBLIDEN.",
