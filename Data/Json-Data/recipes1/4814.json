I left out the leeks and just sauteed sliced Spanish white onions instead and it gave it a sweeter taste. I did not use whipped cream but just heavy table cream instead and it came out fine. This is great winter soup and the lemon wedge and croutons are a perfect addition. Also, a few sprinkles of grated Asiago or parmasan cheese on top is also tasty toppings. Goes well with a very dry, white wine.\n",

My roommate kind of gave me the side-eye when I told him we were having soup, but he sure seemed happy enough to be eating it. I had pre-peeled cloves and I didn't think I could roast those but found that I could. You just toss the cloves with the oil, make a packet out of foil and put them in a 350 oven for about half an hour. They tasted great and it was faster than roasting them in the bulbs. Skipped the lemon because it seemed perfect as it was when I tasted it. I had leftover garlic mashed potatoes from the previous night so I added some of those too. I skipped the puree step; it looked fine as it was. Very delicious, thank you! ",

I also love texture, so I left mine unpureed - and I have to go against the other reviewers and say that next time I would add even MORE leeks and onions to add more texture and sweetness. Other than leaving mine unblended, I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. The base is very velvety and nicely flavored - and the thickness holds up fine against the veggies without pureeing. It wasn't as sweet as I was imagining, so I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar at the end. Garnished with a little ground nutmeg. Excellent - thanks!",
