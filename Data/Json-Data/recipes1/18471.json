First, I know I would have loved the pan seared crust on the fish but frankly, I was too lazy to take that extra step, I didn\u2019t want the grease spatter on my cook top, and frankly, I didn\u2019t want the fried fish smell in the kitchen!  Second, I Iiked the idea of the Dijon mustard, but not on its own.  I knew I liked fish baked with a slather of mayonnaise, so I made a mixture of mayonnaise, an all-purpose seasoning mix for fish and chicken, and the mustard.  That proved to be delicious by the way!  Finally, I expected this would need some color, so I gave the filets a good sprinkle of paprika before popping them into the oven for about 15 minutes. We really enjoyed it, and what I appreciated the most about it was that the mayo/Dijon topping was subtle but still added a certain \u201csomething\u201d to the dish.",

I admit it, I cheated...so here it goes...based on reviews I tweaked it. I don't feel too bad about his as it was submitted by a company and not a \"real person\" I Seasoned the fish with a generic seasoning for pork or fish. Was going to use Lemon pepper but found out too late I was out! Perhaps this was a blessing in disguise? Mixed up some mayo with the country style Dijon Mustard and baked it without searing it first. Yes, I put dried parsley on the top. My only side was an Asparagus Cashew Rice Pilaf also from this site. The results were a 5* restaurant quality meal. No need for any tarter sauce or lemon juice or anything else. It stands on its own. I have made several fish dishes from this site but THIS ONE...OMG!! Easy to make, easy to bake, did not require any special ingredients that are not normally in the pantry or fridge. I can't stop raving about how good this was. Needless to say I will make this again. It just pushed my favorite standby fish recipe which I have been using for the past couple of years to the wayside!!",

The fish wanted to stick, even in a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet and didn't really 'brown', however, when the pieces looked partially cooked on the bottom, we spread them with the mustard, sprinkled on some dried parsley and put them in the oven.  Great flavor, with a little crispiness on the bottom.  Would definitely make again.",
