I did make a few changes to the recipe though I added a tablespoon of vanilla and I put the cocoa in when the butter and sugar had disolved into the milk. I added the peanut butter when the pot was boiling and I boiled for two minutes then poured over the oats in a mixing bowl. You can add the oats in if you want but I prefer this way. I dropped them with a ice cream scop onto wax paper and left uncovered for an hour to harden. The cookies turned out well not too hard and not too soft. PERFECT!",

I had to refrigerate them to turn a gooey mess into actual cookies. It also did not call for enough oatmeal. I had to increase the oatmeal by 1 cup to get this to work. Before adding the extra cup, it was like soup. Some have commented that these are too sweet, but I don't think such a thing exists. I love sugar, and these definitely satisfied my sweet tooth. They were incredibly quick and easy to make. I did not add raisins, walnuts, or any other optional ingredients. I think that would have detracted from the overall flavor. I made 2 batches of these. With the first batch, I started dropping them onto wax paper within a couple of minutes of adding the oatmeal. I found that the oatmeal needed to cook a little longer in the hot sugar/butter/milk mixture. So the first batch came out a little tougher than I would have preferred. With the 2nd batch, I left the oatmeal in the hot sugar/butter/milk mixture for about 5-7 minutes and the texture was much better.  ",

My favorite sweet treat is oatmeal chocolate chip cookies and desperate to have some with no eggs and sleeping children in the house (so no way to get to the store) I came across this recipe. I was hesitant because it sounded hard (I have bad luck boiling milk) however it was so super easy fast and they turned out AWESOME. I didn't even wait for them to cool. After reading the reviews I used only one cup of brown sugar (instead of 2 cups white) and added 1 Tablespoon vanilla. The only thing I'd love to see is maybe how to get the oats chewier (I did use quick cook oats). I followed Sarah's review to a T except I added the oats to the pot after I turned off the heat (to eliminate more dirty bowls). Thanks for sharing this recipe I'm thrilled to have it!!",

Strangely they often won't get firm if it's a rainy day -- but they're always good to eat with a spoon! Put any leftover cookies in ziplock bags in the freezer and they will stay good for days otherwise they get stale tasting pretty quick. We make them without any coconut or nuts but I do add a teaspoon of vanilla after I take them off the burner and before I add the oats. Also I mix the sugar and cocoa together in the pan before I turn on the burner or add any milk or butter. The cocoa mixes in easily that way.",
