I think cutting the amount of water down to 1/2 or 2/3 cup would be better. This coffee/water mixture should be mixed with the wet ingredients--mixing it the way it calls for in the recipe doesn't work very well. Also I think it would help to mix the sugar with the wet ingredients instead of with the dry ingredients. All in all the flavor of this cake is good but the texture is not.",
