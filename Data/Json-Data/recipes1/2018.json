I did do 2 things different and that was after I baked the pie for 35 mins I then added the Crumb topping and baked  it till it was golden and Yummy!! Also I baked it at 400 instead of the 425!

I used half a tablespoon for the sugar mixture and only about a teaspoon for the crumb mixture. I used 5 granny smith apples and baked in at 400 degrees (less is more). For the crust I made my favorite Martha Stewart pate brisee recipe. It's the only way to go and very very easy to make. Email me if you want the recipe! Good luck!",

I use a already made Phyllsbury Pie Crust (plus since it comes with two pie crusts I always make one for us and one to give away!). I peel and thinly slice the granny smith apples and mix them in a bowl with the white sugar and 1 T of cinnamon...it makes a really nice sugary perfectly flavored apple slices to then layer into the pie crust. YUM! Definitely cover the pie near the end as suggested or it will be rock hard and over browned. This warmed on a plate with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you are in dessert heaven baby!:) Thanks for the recipe..love it!",
