I was cooking for everyone at my house as well as my parents, so I used 7 boneless chops that I seasoned with Old Bay.  I cut up a small onion, 1/2 of a small can of mushrooms and 3 cloves of garlic.  I sauteed that mixture and the chops in a little olive oil until they were brown on both sides.  I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and mixed that with 2/3 cup of milk, the sauteed garlic, onions and mushrooms and omitted the water completely. Baked it all uncovered at 350 for 45 minutes.  The gravy ended up being the best gravy I think I have ever tasted and it wasn't too thick or thin.  Served it with mashed potatoes and corn.  I will definitely be making this one often.  Thanks for sharing!",

I added a package of pork gravy mix and a cup of water to the soup, and some Old Bay and onion powder, then poured it over the chops to bake.  You could cut them with a fork, and we were licking the bones to get the last of the gravy.  Absolutely the best baked pork chops I've ever had, this is definitely going in our rotation.",

I use cream of chicken soup (we don't like cream of mushroom soup) and just add a little water to make the gravy.  I also add a pinch of garlic and season all.  I ususally don't bake it, just simmer it slow in a skillet.  This is great comfort food when served with mashed potatoes.",

It was tasty but a little dry and chewy.  I made these the second time using my basic pork chop philosophy, low and slow. I again sauteed onion and fresh mushrooms, added a little Kitchen Bouquet (for color and a little additional flavor) and cooked the chops at 275 degrees for 3 hours.  They were extremely tender and flavorful, no knife required, and JUST DELICIOUS.  This is definitely a keeper now.",

                "reviewBody": "Recipe is pretty good base to start from.  Even better with sauteed mushrooms, onions, and Tbs. of Worcestire sauce added into the sauce.  Just be sure to adjust your salt accordingly as the Worcestire is plenty salty in itself.  Additionally, 4 or 5 potatoes thinly sliced then sauteed in tbs. butter for a few mins. with Tbs. or so of fresh chopped parsley and tsp. or so minced garlic.... then layer these on the bottom of your greased casserole before adding the chops.  Increase the milk in this recipe to 1 and 1/4 cups to accomodate for the potato addition and pour over chops and potatoes. Cover, then bake for 30 mins.  Remove cover and continue baking until potatoes are done to fork tender (approx. additional 15-20 mins.)  You could also shake n' bake your pork chops prior to browning for an additional flare. Sprinkle dish with remaining bread crumbs or shake n' bake mixture for some crunchiness. Serves great with steamed fresh green beans or asparagus and a loaf of fresh bread or dinner rolls. This is an easy yet wonderfully tasty comfort meal.  And the recipe is flexible enough for adjusting to your own family's tastes and tradition.  Fast and troublefree enough to make during a busy weeknight that tastes like you've been slaving at the stove for hours. Definitely a keeper for the recipe box.  Would also work well with chicken breasts.",

Be careful with adding salt. This had plenty by the time I seasoned the pork chops before sauteing and the cream of mushroom soup has its own salt.",
