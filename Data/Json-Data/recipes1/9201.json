I reduced the amount of sour cream for my husband and I also added mushrooms!  I steamed the broccoli and mushrooms first.  Instead of cubing or cutting the chicken, I used the Cuisinart (every chef should have one!).  It shredded the chicken and the consistency in the dish was flourished in every bite. I also used the Cuisinart for the steamed mushrooms and the olives.  I totally nixed the curry because I heard many bad things about it; the taste and smell and read one review about how they had to throw it out.  I also found a suggestion to put smashed croutons on top. My husband and I couldn't stop eating it and my daughter even had 2nds! Be careful, it's addicting! We froze the leftovers and Lisa is right, the leftovers are even better. I gave some leftovers to my Mother-in-Law and freind at work and they just couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  Make it today!\r\nYUMMY!!!!",

I also substituted cream of mushroom soup since others mentioned liking mushrooms in it. I wish I had used frozen broccoli - the fresh broccoli did not cook in 30 minutes. I ended up having to cook it for another 20 minutes covered. Overall, it's a really tasty recipe!",
