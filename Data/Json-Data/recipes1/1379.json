I have 1/2 of the apple mixture sitting in my refrigerator right now. I did reduce the amount of cinnamon. 2 tablespoons in the apple mixture and 2 for the topping. Still though the topping did not do what I imagined it would. I am not going to go to the trouble of making another crust but I think I may go ahead and make up another batch of topping for the other half of apples sitting in my fridge but add some margarine to it and sprinkle it on top in a casserole and see what it does. My father-in-law who loves apple pie never asked for seconds or to keep some leftovers.",
