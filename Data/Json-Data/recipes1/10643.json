I'll often use butter as well as the olive oil, and some fresh basil, parsley and/or chives. Freshly grated Parmesan or Romano is a fine substitute for Asiago. A few crushed red pepper flakes is good too, although I prefer this without. The tomatoes are meant to be fresh and uncooked, briefly tossed with the pasta just before serving.  The fresh thyme was new to me, however, and I wasn't so sure I'd like it.  I did.",

The flavors pair together nicely and I can see replacing the fresh thyme with fresh basil. I did add a bit of fresh basil as I had some on hand. I also added a little Parmesan with the Asiago.  No matter what Italian cheese you have on hand you're sure to enjoy this dish!",
