I like using maraschino cherries so I cut them up squeeze the extra juice out in a paper towel then up the flour by 2 Tablespoons and my cookies come out perfectly.:)",

It was not until I started spooning the dough onto my cookie sheet that I realized this made 3.5 dozen (ikes!)!!! I am really glad I have so many cookies though. These are DEEELICIOUS and rich - their small size is perfect for this very reason.:) These and a cold glass of milk would be a great gift for \"Santa\" lol! I can't wait to share my \"treasures\" with my train buddies and co-workers (and my hubby's co-workers too!). NOTE: My cookies baked perfectly in 13.5 - 14 minutes (just be sure to allow to rest BEFORE transferring to wire racks to finish cooling). These will most definitely become part of my yearly holiday rotation and are definitely a GREAT find on here. Thanks SO much for sharing Theresa!:-)",
