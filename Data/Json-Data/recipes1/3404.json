I had never made Lima soup before and so glad and a favorite. Of course my husband loved it too. My favorite was always Pea soup but I think I've been converted. The Lima beans are so light and velvety and the carrots add a touch of sweetness. I cooked with ham hocks so extra delicious and never forget the Bay leaves but next time I think I'll try the veggie only way. I made a mistake and pureed it a little too much big mistake since those Lima beans are the stars of the show. Thanks for a great recipe.",
