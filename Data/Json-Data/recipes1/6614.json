The one thing I find with store bought is it's just too sweet - you can control the sweetness yourself with this one.  I didn't cut back on the sugar the first time and found it a tad too sweet - so I added some dry powdered mustard and more black pepper to overcome that. I also used all buttermilk (making my own out of 1/2 cup milk - l/2 tablespoon of white vinegar - let sit for 10 minutes). By the way - the longer your coleslaw sits the runnier it will get because the cabbage leaks out water when it is mixed with the dressing - which is a good thing - you are getting the taste of cabbage.  The longer it sits the more flavorful it becomes. I always try to make coleslaw way in advance (as much as three days).  You can always transfer it to another bowl before serving to get rid of the excess juices if you like.  My fellow cooks - think about it - do you think that KFC and stores are preparing their slaw one hour before our purchase???  Thanks submitter - its a keeper and really nothing has to be changed - my minor change of now just using a tad less sugar and all buttermilk is just a matter of preferance.",

He also states to make sure to let cole slaw sit at least two hours before serving. Happy Cooking!!",

It does tend to get runny if stored, so I make the dressing and keep it in a separate container, mixing just enough cabbage and dressing on a meal by meal basis when I need it.  Dressing keeps well for about 5-6 days...in fact it gets better with age!  Really wonderful!  Also, if you don't have any buttermilk on hand, you can buy the powdered buttermilk (Sago is one brand I have found).  Perfect when you need only 1/4 cup!",

Everything else I leave the same (using light mayo- Hellmans/Best Foods), and sometimes forget to add the onion.  We love to eat it both freshly made (crispier, yum) or up to 3 days old.  The longer it sits the more the salt will draw out the water from the cabbage- I ust pour off the excess water before stirring.  Delicious!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!",
