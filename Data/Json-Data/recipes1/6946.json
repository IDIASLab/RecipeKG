I love a good Cobb Salad, but I never much paid attention to what I know is a classic list of ingredients.  So glad to find this recipe here, and this is quite easily the best Cobb Salad I've ever had anywhere, probably because I controlled the ingredients, their quality and their freshness.  I stuck to the ingredients as written as, again, I recognize them to be critical to an authentic Cobb Salad.  I did, however, make my own Buttermilk Ranch Dressing.   This was an ideal dinner to make for myself since Hubs is out of town and he would have never eaten this in a million years - well, not with the Blue cheese anyway.  My tummy is happy.  (Tip: Penzey's Spices makes a seasoning blend called \"Buttermilk Dressing and Dip\" which makes a quick but awesome ranch dressing!  I don't even use buttermilk - just sour cream, mayo and half and half to desired thickness)",

However, who cares if it's not the \"original\" recipe; if it tastes good, eat it! I prefer a mixture of romaine and butter lettuce with a dressing consisting of red wine vinegar, olive oil (which I drizzle in slowly to emulsify) dijon mustard, chopped fresh chives and crumbled blue cheese. Any way you decide to make this salad with whatever dressing, it will always be a hit. Thanks so much Mr. Bill!",
