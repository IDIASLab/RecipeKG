I think my Dad ate the pie in less than one day and then wanted the recipe.  One thing I learned (and maybe it's just the case with Splenda substituted) is that using a nonstick skillet is much better than a saucepan.  Even with me constantly stirring, it scorched on two different pans and then did great when I finally moved to the nonstick pan.  One note: If you are subbing Splenda for sugar, you may wish to reduce the Splenda amount slightly from what is called for in sugar quantity - Splenda tends to turn out a little sweeter than sugar.  \n\nGreat recipe - Thanks!",

The pie tasted allright, but had lots of cocoa lumps and wasn't really presentable.  Second time around I made it according to original recipe and also sifted all dry ingredients - not only was it beautiful, it was delicious (and we didn't think it was overly sweet like others did)!  SO, my advice is to stick with the recipe as is!!  (only thing different I did use Emeril's recipe for meringue).",

Some tips I used to avoid unsightly lumpiness (which is inevitable with recipes like this) was to sift the dry ingredients together stir the liquid mixture constantly and then strain out smaller lumps as it begins to thicken on the stove. The egg proteins will cause some lumps as they cook -- and espcially as you scrape the bottom of the sauce pan with the flat bottom spoon. Fortunately they smooth right out after adding the butter with a little help from the handheld mixer. My end result was a perfectly firm but creamy smooth texture and a delicious flavor. Thanks for submitting this recipe. Reminds me of Mom's chocolate pie.",

When I cooked the pie filling in a saucepan I stirred constantly cooked it on a medium-low flame and achieved a beautiful non-lumpy mixture. I had no problems with the meringue (although 6TB sugar is way way too sweet 3 or 4 will be much better). The problem is the pie never set. It baked about 20 or 25 min at 325 and even though I knew it was still liquid the meringue was clearly done. The pie filling itself is way too sweet even for my sweet tooth. Honestly just too much sugar. I'm not going to give up on it though. Next time I'm going to 1) cut back on the sugar both on the meringue and the pie filling and 2) use cornstarch to thicken the filling.",

Per many other reviews saying it was too sweet I reduced the sugar to 3/4 of a cup. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I cooked the filling on 4 (on a 1 to 8 dial) for exactly seven minutes stirring constantly with a flathead wooden spoon scraping the bottom where the filling wants to thicken up. Then to fight these lumps from the bottom when I pulled it from the heat I used a wire whisk to stir in the butter which I had set out before I began so it would get soft. With the wire whisk I was able to create a completely consistent filling. I poured the filling in into my crust which I had cooked for ten minutes in the 325 degree oven. Then and this is a time the original recipe doesn't give since it uses visual cues to judge I cooked the pie for exactly 24 minutes also at 325 degrees. I cooked it with just the chocolate filling because I prefer whipped cream to meringue. Then I cooled it in the refrigerator over night. It had a perfect texture and a mild chocolate flavor that went great with the crispy flour crust and the sweet whipped cream. My mother father and brother all talked about how great it was.",
