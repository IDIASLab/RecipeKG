Even after I added more (and a little butter) they would stay together for a little while but crumble anyways. The chocolate doesn't stick to the bars and it's best to melt the chocolate chips on the stove cause I burnt mine in the microwave! =) This recipe does taste really good though and exactly like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups! Great to make if you don't mind it being VERY crumbly and powdery. I would dip apple slices in the powder stuff and it tasted great!",
