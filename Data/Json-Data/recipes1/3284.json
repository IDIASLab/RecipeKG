Both are similar and come out perfect texture; except the topping method is different. I had a BUTTER PECAN CAKE MIX which was a nice choice for this. This recipe is very forgiving as I had off-brand flour and old yeast; but yet they came out light and fluffy. I didn't have pecans to top with. Filled an 11x15 glass pan and no burning nor scorching on the bottom. I do find with both recipes that it takes more than 1/2 hour to double in bulk; more like 1 hours. The caramel sauce on top did sink some to the bottom but they are not really 'gooey' syrupy. I'm not sure if I would double the recipe for the sauce next time. I did whip up some cream cheese frosting to drizzle over top which I think it needed. All in all a good recipe. I'd like to tinker with the caramel sauce because I do like that goo and I love cake mix cinnamon rolls due to the versatility and they are always so light and fluffy. I've made them several times and each time they have come out perfect.",

I like dense heavy dough and these were very cakey and light. I had to add almost 3 extra cups of flour to the recipe. Maybe it has to do with the damp weather outside? but that was quite strange and no-one else had that in their review... I thought the dough was SO EASY TO WORK WITH - it was very light and streachable!! This is the first time I made cinnamon rolls with a white sugar and cinnamon filling as opposed to my usual brown sugar and cinnamon filling. I prefer the brown sugar - as it has a stronger flavor. I did not make the extra gooey sauce...",

The ones that were fit closely into the one pan turned out perfectly!
