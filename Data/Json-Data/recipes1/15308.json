I ended up using the Cool Whipped Frosting from this site with it which worked out well as I think anything else would have made the cake way too rich. It was enjoyed by the whole family but definitely keep in mind that it's a heavy rich cake. I think it would probably make good muffins/cupcakes dur to its denseness but I haven't actually tried it as such yet so I have no idea how they'd end up baking. I would recommend it as long as you aren't expecting a light fluffy style cake.",

I made a simple icing (2T butter creamed with 1 c powdered sugar then whisked 2 T milk into it) which worked well. Served it with vanilla ice cream. I would like to try it again with less baking powder. I'll try to remember to edit this review after I tinker a bit. However I do think this was a good cake and did not taste \"healthy\" despite the wheat flour. I got compliments from family & guests! And that's why I voted 5 stars instead of 4.",
