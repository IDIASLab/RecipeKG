Spread the dough into the 9 x 13 dish with a metal spatula, THEN sprinkle the chocolate chips on top of it and press them with the spatula - much easier to do.\nThis is definitely joining my stack of favorite recipes!",

Two eggs makes it too cakey. 2) I made the recipes exactly as directed, but in reverse. I put the brownie layer on the bottom and dropped little spoonfuls of the cookie dough all over the top until it was covered. I think this works much better because it removes the spreading problems referred to by other reviewers, it's easier to tell when it's done because you can judge the color of the cookie layer, and it just looks prettier in my opinion! I had to bake it for 30 minutes. The cookie layer was dark tan  when it was done, almost brown.",

Not overly sweet, either....I've seen some recipes that I know would just be too sweet (seriously, it is a brownie on top of a cookie!) but this recipe has a good balance of sugars. My two \"issues:\" 1.) the cookie dough layer is VERY DIFFICULT to spread over the bottom of a 13 by 9 inch pan. It's like this recipe needed just a little more \"dough.\" 2.)  You seriously have to let this recipe cool completely...like maybe even put it in the fridge (I did) before trying to cut it.  The bottom cookie layer is definitely softer, so it needs to be cooled completely before cutting otherwise it is a big mess.  So...just don't think you can make this and eat it soon after!",

Rich :) Based on what the other reviews said about not having enough cookie dough, I increased the recipe by half and I had a perfect amount of cookie dough to cover the 9x13 pan. I could have left the brownie recipe as is but it made a nice thick treat! I used parchment paper instead of greasing the pan, edges overhung the pan so I was able to lift it out prior to cutting. It took about 45 to bake in my oven. I will make it again!",

I always reduce sugar in recipes (reduced from 1/4 c to just over 1/8 c white sugar for cookie layer and from 1 c to 3/4 c in brownie layer).  Only used 1 egg in brownie layer for a fudgier texture.  Found the cookie layer difficult to cover bottom of 13x9 pan, so 2nd time I made recipe I used 11x7 pan.  I'll also try to increase the cookie layer by 50% next time to fit the 13x9, since more of these would be appreciated in my house!!!!\nGreat recipe!  Thanks for sharing!",
