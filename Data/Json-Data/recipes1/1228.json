Folks, please follow the recipe first before you change anything and review it\u2026 then, change whatever you like. If your version turns out good please share it with us under the custom versions. We would love that..... Ok with that said and out of the way, I loved this pie. It was so easy to make and just about as perfect as you can get for a blueberry pie. The crust was the easiest crust I have ever made. No need for a rolling pin! Thank you Fabian Karrholm for sharing this recipe with us!",
