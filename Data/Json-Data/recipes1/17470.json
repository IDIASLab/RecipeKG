Wow was I ever surprised that these didn't turn to mush!:) I made half a recipe since it's just me and hubby and made it exactly as written. These whip together really quickly and are so easy. A nice blend of flavors which I didn't find too spicy at all. They were quite salty though. I'm not sure I'd make these again but if I do I'll probably just use half the ranch dressing packet to cut down on the salt and/or use unsalted crackers.",

The crackers won't get soggy whatsoever (it's witchcraft) but they're intensely flavorful and have a bit of a kick to them which is of course adjustable. Two things: the ranch dressing is full of sodium so opt for reduced or zero sodium crackers. Two they can be a bit greasy to handle so if you're serving them by themselves you might want to have tongs and plenty of napkins beside them so nobody gets greasy ranch hands (ha! I said ranch hands!). Oyster crackers would be a better choice for soups. I recommend this recipe!",
