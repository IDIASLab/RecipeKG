                "reviewBody": "This is the real deal y'all serious pecan pie action going on here. I prepared the recipe almost exactly as written. Actually I made two pies at once so I used one entire can of pintos drained (the recipe didn't say one way or the other) which ended up being a little more than c whole beans per pie. Before I added the pinto beans I smashed them flat into lumpy paste with a spatula. I mixed everything together on my mixer's highest setting so it was pretty smooth. My hands were shaking a little when I measured the vanilla so I think a little extra got in there. I also used an entire 6oz bag ( 1 c) of pecan halves to completely cover the top of two pies. After 20 of the 60 minutes had passed I covered the crust edges with foil. Be careful because the pie filling is still really sloshy at that point. This tastes AMAZING just like a pecan pie! Definitely needs cold milk or whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.:) Next time I think I'll make it in a real homemade crust instead of a refrigerated one.",
