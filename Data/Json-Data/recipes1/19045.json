This is indeed one of those\ndishes that seems to develop flavor overnight.  However I found a way\nto increase the flavor from the get go. Simply take the tough parts\nof the asparagus stem (the part you'd normally discard) and SIMMER \nthem in the chicken broth for 30 mins or so. Then discard them and \nproceed as per recipe. Adds a bang to the flavor.\nMany thanks, Chef John.",

The single pinch of nutmeg and cayenne faintly hinted something was going on in the background but extremely lame. I probably added 3 pinches of each after taste testing while cooking. It was rated 3* at that juncture. The next day, however, this soup significantly improved, and I would rate it between 4*-5*. The cream topping is the star performer so don\u2019t leave that out, and don\u2019t be shy with the lemon zest (or add a few drops of lemon juice to make it more lemony). In terms of method and saving time, blended this soup in a Vitamix blender which eliminated the immersion blender and mesh strainer steps. This would be a fine, healthy choice if wanting to eat light on a hot summer day or trying to trim a hefty waistline. As Chef John said, it is a gorgeously colored, green soup.",

This made a lot of sense to me.  So, I prepared the recipe as written and added this step.  After really pureeing the soup and passing it through a very fine sieve, I finished the recipe off as written.  No need to wait the 24 hours.  This is one of the best soups I have ever had.  The added flavor from the woody stems extracted in this manner gave this soup fabulous flavor.  \n     With this soup it is so important to taste, adjust seasonings, taste again and adjust as needed.  I will keep this recipe forever and it will be the star of my next dinner party.  The lemon cream with the parmesan and lemon zest takes it over the top.  Thank you so much, Chef John, and the wonderful reviewer who suggested extracting all that great flavor from the stems.",
