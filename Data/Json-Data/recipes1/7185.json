Had a huge bag full from my garden, so thought I would try this way (like to roast them and freeze for cooking through the winter). These turned out way too dry!! Will do the next couple batches my old way -- just cut them in half, remove the seeds and put them under the broiler for 6 to 10 mins. until blackened and blistered. I line a baking sheet with foil and just wrap it around them to cool before peeling.  Works great and no mess on the pan.",
