It is NOT a typo but you do need to use real white chocolate (I use Ghiardellhi brand) and make sure to melt it very slowly over a double boiler. If done correctly all of the butter is absorbed smoothly into the chocolate. \nI made a variation of this recipe that turned out wonderful today. I cut down the lime juice by maybe 1/8 cup and added about 1/2 cup or a little more pureed fresh strawberries. The result is a tangy strawberry lime endeavor that is just out of this world in taste!!! I have also added 2 pureed peaches to the lime juice and an additional egg. That version was wonderful too.",

Unfortunately,  because of some problems I encountered, I can't rate this recipe highly. First,  I think it's fair to say  most will interpret a 9\" pie pan to mean Pyrex. And even if not,  since it would be at least fair to say they MIGHT use a Pyrex pie dish, the recipe should warn that freezing  (or even chilling) the dish, then putting it into a hot oven, is not recommended,  as it would invite a potentially serious  accident of a shattered dish. This cautionary advisory is important!  I chose to use an 8\" square metal pan. Next,  my years of baking experience should have alerted me that baking the crust 25 minutes  is too long. So long that I threw out an expensive, over-browned crust and started over.  Fifteen  minutes was more like it. The butter/chocolate filling blended nicely, but just as I feared, once baked with the filling much of the butter melted and pooled at the top. I had to sop it up with paper towels. This was the ultimate deal breaker for me. To sum up the final result, the crust was tough and salty (I have not seen unsalted macadamia nuts - almonds would  be a cheaper and no-salt option),  the chocolate /butter filling too rich - like eating a stick of butter. The  overall flavor was good, but  largely due to the Key Lime pie filling. One could accomplish as good or better result, easier and cheaper too,  just making a Key Lime Pie.",

The only thing I change is completely omiting the butter in the white chocolate. It is 100% unnecessary. A good quality white chocolate is the only thing you need. I use 1 1/2 (= 6 oz) Ghirardelli's white choc. baking bar, or find any couverture chocolate. DO NOT use chips! They won't melt into the satiny liquid puddle of yumminess you want, and you will have a big gloppy mess. Also, be very careful when melting chocolate in your double boiler. One tiny droplet of water in your chocolate and it will seize.",

Now I am wondering if the 8 tablespoons of butter you mix with the white chocolate is a misprint. That is way too much butter the white chocolate could not incorporate it. When I melted it and poured it into the pie crust it was already separating and the baked pie was positively swimming in butter during baking. There was a pool on top when I pulled it out of the oven that I had to sop up with paper towels. I also thought the crust was much too gritty like crunching gravel. For all the time I spent I was so disappointed. I've since then read that butter should never be mixed with melted chocolate but should have been melted with one tablespoon of shortening.",
