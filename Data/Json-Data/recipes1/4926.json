I also put ground pepper on every layer. I cooked 4 chicken leg quarters without skin, so I used one can of family sized cream of mushroom, added 3/4 cup of water, some fresh sliced mushrooms and fresh chopped parsley. To top it off, I added some shredded swiss cheese. The baking time was tricky, but it was definitely over an hour for me at 350, I cranked it up later on to speed up cooking time. The chicken turned out tender. I would definitely make this again. I used the food processor to get the vegetables very thin, it worked out well.",
