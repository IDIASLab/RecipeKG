The only tip I would give as someone did before me is to make sure the bread/cream cheese mixture is rolled first before coating in cinnamon sugar. This prevents almost all the mess than if you try to complete roll by roll. I also pressed down the bread slightly after cutting off the crusts to obtain a tighter roll.",
