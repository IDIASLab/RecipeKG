Here are the changes I made: couldn't find a 7 1/2 oz jar of babyfood so I used 2-4 oz. jars of baby carrots. I only used 1/2 c of canola oil since I had many times substituted applesauce for all the oil in a recipe and only made 1/2 a recipe of the frosting using 1/3 less fat cream cheese. That made plenty of frosting. Also FYI about 2 medium carrots chopped in my mini food processor made 1/2 c. It may just be my oven but I had to bake it for a total of 35 minutes before the cake tester came out clean. The end-product is a cake rather than a cookie very moist very delicious! I store this in the refrigerator due to the cream cheese in the frosting. Thank you Star!",
