Helpful Hints: in place of 1/2 cup of soy sauce sub 1/2 cup low sodium beef broth to pan and let simmer for the indicated time. Last 3 minutes of cooking add cornstarch/cold water to thicken and 2 turns of low sodium soy sauce to the pan and continue reducing. No need to season with the salt as the recipe indicates as the soy sauce replaces it. For presentation toast sesame seeds and sprinkle on the beans prior to serving.",

Luckily I didn't read any of the most recent review before making this recipe as the beans ended up being absolutely delicious. (yes it's salty but there's a freaking 1/2 cup of soy sauce! That only makes sense!) I didn't have any of the problems that the other cooks experienced and I did not find the beans to be very \"labor intensive\". My only complaint is that I halved the recipe (for 2 people) and the cook time ended up being a little too long. If you like your beans a little crunchy I recommend cutting back the simmer time. Otherwise they are a perfect side dish for a weekday or weekend meal.",

I cooked the beans till nearly done and while they were cooking sauteed the onion in butter rather than margarine with some fresh minced garlic. I added a little chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon which I assumed meant bouillon crystals. The amount of soy sauce as directed seemed excessive so I just gave it a couple of shots. To this mixture I added the nearly cooked green beans tossing to coat. Very good!",

I used 3 cloves of crushed garlic but will increase that to at least 4 next time. I only needed to simmer for 10 minutes so they were still a little crisp.
