I did process the bran cereal in a food processor until fine which helped with texture. I will definitely make these again perhaps subbing some of the milk powder with protein powder.",

I use a melon ball scoop to help portion out the balls. These also freeze nicely if you don't have a house full of mouths to gobble them up. Nice and sweet you would never guess by the taste that these are good for you and have better nutritional value than traditional snack food. Perfect recipe \"as is.\" Thank you for sharing Emily!",
