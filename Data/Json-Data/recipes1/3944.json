Defeinitely omit the cinnamon. Not sure why you would want to add cinnamon to a traditional cottage pie. Like a lot of other reviewers, i added worsteshire sauce, approx 2 teaspoons, as well as 1/2 cup of peas. I'd also recommend cutting back on the cheese. Just enough to brown on top of the mashed potato is sufficient. Finally, stick to lean ground beef...you can cut back on the the oily, greasy film which can overpower the taste of all other ingredients...as well as the waistline",

I agree with other reviewers on several points: (1) Though cinnamon can add a nice element with red meat, here it comes through too strongly; cut back quite a bit on the amount. (2) Use less milk in the potatoes - just make them however you usually make your mashed potatoes. (3) I used water instead of beef broth and added some worcestershire sauce because the meat mixture seemed to need some extra flavor.  Next time I would go a step further and use some garlic and extra seasonings to perk it up.  Enjoy!",

I have noticed a couple of reviewers mention a pie crust and it not being authentic to the recipe.  I agree, Cottage Pie does not have a pie crust, but I can see no reference to it in this recipe.  As mentioned in another review, Worcestershire Sauce adds valuable flavor to the meat in this dish.  Don't add too much tomato paste, if any and just play around with herbs til you get the flavor you like.  You don't need to whip the potatoes, just make them as you normally would and spoon them onto the meat - the rougher, the better.  I even fluff mine with a fork before adding the cheese, which makes the peaks a little crunchy.  This dish is not meant to be complicated, so keep it simple.  It's a quick and easy meal to make on a budget.  A great comfort food and very tasty.",

For a hamburger meal, it had a lovely, complex flavor.  I followed the recipe except for using a pie crust, which does not seem authentic.  I doubled the meat portion of the recipe and froze it in the pie plate to be topped with mashed potatoes later for a busy night meal.  Also, I take a can of tomato paste and empty it into a zip baggy for freezing, then just break off what is needed (be sure to flatten paste before freezing).",

It would have certainly boiled over in a pie dish or an 8 by 8 dish. This recipe turned out wonderful! I changed the recipe a bit because I was just using ingredients I had on hand. I didn't use carrots used chicken broth instead of beef and used 1 tbsp dried parsley instead of fresh. I also used the full amount of milk and would do it that way again although it would probably be fine with less. I used the full amount of cinnamon and hardly noticed it. It didn't seem \"overpowering\" at all. I also added garlic salt to the potatos for more flavor. I'll make this one again!",

I'm glad I did, it gave it an authentic taste and makes a difference. Also, be sure to add a lot more salt than is called for. I added a bunch more pinches, and I also added generous amounts of Wort. sauce. Otherwise, this would have been pretty bland. Just keep tasting the meat throughout the process and keep adding until you like it. I also added frozen peas to the meat mixture.",

                "reviewBody": "Dennis the Menice really loved this recipe. I made a few changes though. I didn't have any fresh parsley laying around so I used about 1 Tbsp dried parsley. I ran to the store to get tomato paste (which I hate buying a whole can of tomato paste for just 1 Tbsp). As a previous review stated using ketchup instead adds a little sweetness to the recipe so I added an additional 1 Tbsp of ketchup too. Next time I'll just use the ketchup. I also added 1 Tbsp of Worchestershire (a must) and 1 tsp of dijon mustard for a little zing. For the mashed potatoes I nuked some of Stoffers frozen garlic mashed potatoes and spread it on top of the meat mixture to save time. Quick easy and delish.",
