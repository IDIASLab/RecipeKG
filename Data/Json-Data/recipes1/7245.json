Carbonnade should have belgian or similar ale and vinegar - not lemon juice. Take lean stew beef dredged in flour - brown and deglaze pan with broth set aside. Thick slices of regular onions (1.5 pounds) and 6 cloves of garlic crushed - brown on low heat until onions are caramelized - very dark and sweet. Add 2 cans beef broth 2 tsp thyme 2 bay leaves 2 tbsp brown sugar 2 tsps red wine vinegar and 16-24 ozs beer like Bass Ale. Cook 2 hours at 325 take lid off for the last hour to thicken. Add 2 - 3 more tsp red wine vinegar and season with salt and pepper - serve over egg noodles.",

I substituted ground beef chuck and it looked a little less classy than it could've but everyone enjoyed it. My only problem was the large amounts of fatty bacon in the stew and also that it was much soupier than I'd thought it would be. I think if I make it again I might use a bit less bacon and a little more flour. I definitely loved the lemon taste mixed with the beer--and I don't even like beer!",
