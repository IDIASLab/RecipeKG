First and most important the coffee flavor is fairly potent and because it's so prominent I believe it should be mentioned in the recipe's title or you're in for a big surprise. In other words the coffee in this recipe is more than just enough to intensify the chocolate flavor! Second the frosting is only mildly chocolate and very light in color. If you want a deeper chocolate frosting both in color and flavor check out \"Rich Chocolate Frosting \" also from this site. So it wasn't what I wanted or expected being light in chocolate flavor and heavy in coffee flavor but it was still very good. Light creamy fluffy and piped nicely. Perhaps if this was named more aptly like \"Mocha Buttercream \" I might have been inclined to rate this higher.",
