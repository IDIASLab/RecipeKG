It\u2019s also the name of a dish made from vegetables and meat. I cooked the meat separately this time, but I\u2019m sure it would be terrific in the pot. It\u2019s funny, I\u2019m not really a big vegetable eater and some of the vegetables in this dish are not very appealing to me, but the combination of the vegetables and the spices makes this something special.

The chicken didn't pick up any of the flavors and the garbanzo beans seemed to add texture but no flavor.\r\n\r\nI think  next time I'll put the chicken in a ziploc bag with the garlic, onion, ginger and lemon zest for a few hours before starting. \r\n\r\nI did like the butternut squash, though.

I've tried it both with the butternut squash, and with sweet potatoes (yams) when I had no squash -- either will work fine. Instead of ground coriander (I don't have any) I use fresh coriander -- cilantro. I chop about 1 1/2T and it gives it a pretty look and great flavor. Last time, I also added 1/2t cumin, as well as 1/4 cup raisins. It has a nice sweet/salty flavor -- would be great with fresh lemon wedges as a garnish, as well. To make it more filling, last time I cooked a couple cups of basmati rice and stirred it in at the last minute... not so soupy, but still a nice consistency, and it goes a bit farther.",
