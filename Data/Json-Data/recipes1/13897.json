I had the chance to get almond flour which is mostly grated almonds and used it instead of grinding my almonds. I was a bit in a hurry. The result was very good. I will make it again with the adjustment and maybe use amaretto to enhance the almond flavor. If you are afraid of the liquor flavor I doubled them both and you could not taste it. As an overall the cookie is very good just use the best preserve you can find out there it will make the recipe totally worth the effort!",
