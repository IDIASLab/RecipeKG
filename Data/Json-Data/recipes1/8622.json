I wasn't too crazy about the tomato soup so I used cream of mushroom instead and I added a 16 oz. container of sour cream. I served it over egg noodles and it was a hit! The onion soup made it taste a bit like onion soup dip and it makes your guests wonder what that delicious secret ingredient is. This modified version is going into my rotation!",

The mixture can't be too hot when you add the sour cream otherwise it causes the fat and the cream to seperate. If you take the pan off the burner and allow it to cool and then add the sour cream immediately before serving, it is well worth the trouble!!",
