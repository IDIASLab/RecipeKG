I might has well have just boiled up some chicken and asparagus. If you like bland food (like something from a cafeteria or buffet) then go for it. I hate to be a meanie but it just wasn't that yummy! How did it get these reviews? I put two cans of soup added some milk- the consistency was nice. I added mushrooms as well and served it over rice. It needs something else though. Perhaps sour cream or melted cream cheese? Maybe some lemon juice? Something that compliments the tarragon I don't know what. Maybe just needs more tarragon. Definitely needs salt and pepper.",
