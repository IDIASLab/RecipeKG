I kept it in my cake caddy and it was still nice and moist when I was ready to serve it. I heated it up and served it with vanilla ice cream. It was really yummy. My sister asked for the recipe because her boyfriend liked it so much. I think that next time I make it I may try pouring a chocolate glaze of some kind over it or making cupcakes with it. I will be making this again really soon.",
