                "reviewBody": "5.16.21 I\u2019ve lived in Florida a long time and eaten (and love) a lot of  Cuban food.  I made this recipe as written, tasted, and thought it was really lacking flavor.  The only change I made was adding the bell pepper, raisins and peas to the skillet when I added the potato-carrot mixture and seasonings to simmer, concerned that 2 minutes at the end just wouldn\u2019t do it.  In an effort to bump up flavor, I added more soy sauce, a healthy shot of Worcestershire sauce, and even a splash of red wine.  Favor was still not where I felt it should be. I\u2019ve eaten this at restaurants, and I then added what I think is the missing ingredient.  It really needs tomato (tomato paste or tomato sauce).  I added an 8-oz can of tomato sauce, and that really brought this to life.  Not sure why this wasn\u2019t part of the recipe,  because if I\u2019m not mistaken, it\u2019s traditional.  That single ingredient made a world of difference.  The addition of diced potatoes was something I\u2019d never had before, but I liked them.  Most likely will use leftovers in tacos or quesadillas.  With the tweaks I made, this turned out pretty well, and my rating is based on those changes.  Served with white rice, baked plantains, and Cuban bread.",
