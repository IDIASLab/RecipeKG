After the potatoes are cooked set them aside (but don't let them cool all the way use them while they are still very warm). Then cook the bacon and set it aside. Add the onions to the bacon fat in the pan and cook until softened. Drain most of the bacon fat leaving a couple of tablespoonsful. Add a few tablespoons of flour to the pan and cook a minute or two. Then add the vinegar and sugar and bring to a boil till it thickens and pour over warm potatoes and sprinkle the reserved bacon over. Adding the flour gives the sauce some thickness.",

No one could ever say they were lazy cooks....spaetzles on a sieve? hahaha.  all hand done on the old steel grater.

After mixing potatoes with sauce I bake at 325 degrees for 2 hours. What I like to do is cook up b o v s sauce freeze it and have it on hand so all I have to do is thaw the sauce and add potatoes when I am short on time. It makes a nice traditional dish to take to funerals. We are a Germans from Russia settlement and many my generation and younger do not take the time to make traditional dishes.",

I used a Russett potatoe and this probably needs a new or red potatoe to make it right.
