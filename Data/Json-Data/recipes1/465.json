Gingersnaps have always been one of my special favorites--cookies I absolutely adore but tend to be picky about and thus have only very rarely.  Now I've found a perfect recipe so I can make them on my own!  The holidays are long past, yet my apartment currently smells like Christmas, and I have about 3 dozen light, crisp, pleasantly spicy, semi-sweet cookies cooling in my kitchen.  This is definitely a recipe going in my \"Will Bake Many Times Again\" file!",

I had a lot against me - biased views and no knowledge whatsoever with this type of cookie! I've never made Gingersnaps before. The smell of the cookies during the mixing stage was wonderful! Very Christmasy. :) The baking smell was even better! My kids couldn't keep their hands off these cookies once they were done, and when I tasted them I could see why! These cookies are amazing in flavor! I did do one thing different from the recipe - I added 1 teaspoon of cloves into this as well, because my husband likes his gingersnaps good with spice. The drumroll for me came when he came home at night and I gave him a cookie to try. I could tell he wasn't expecting much (being biased for his mother's) but after the first bite his eyes got wide and he said \"Wow! These are REALLY good! They taste just like Mom's!\" I told him that her recipe is different (hers calls for oil) and he said, \"Don't worry about it - just make these - they are wonderful!\" They have a great outside texture for crunch and inside chewiness. Perfection in my husband's opinion! Now I wish I had made these much sooner in my married life. His smile and face was all worth the jitters of messing it up! :)",

They are definitely more chewy than traditional gingersnaps, but we like them that way.  The only problem I had was trying to figure out the correct cinnamon/sugar mix.  I first used too much cinnamon and they turned out dark-looking and too \"cinnamony\". I then mixed 1/3 cup sugar with just one and half tsp. cinnamon, and they were perfect!  Very good!",
