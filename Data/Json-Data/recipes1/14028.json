Also all the raisins end up clumped together if you simply pour the mixture into the crust. You should carefully spread them around or they'll all end up in the middle bottom of the pie. The flavor was okay but the consistency was a bit stodgy and it was too sweet. I'd omit the the sugar or half the syrup. I also added a teaspoon of ginger and vanilla which deepened the flavors some. Finally I'd add more nuts - the recipe as written makes for a gooey pie filling and it needed more body. I think next time I'll use whole or half walnuts/pecans /hazelnuts and add double the amount.",
