Drain & rinse and you've just shaved off 2 hours of prep time for this recipe. BUT a nice addition I discovered: some grocery stores offer this nice mix of fresh mushrooms (shitake portabella etc...) already pre-sliced perhaps for stir fry but I bought a package and when I sauted the onions I sauted these mushrooms in too! Wonderful! A can of diced pimentos also adds some beautiful color to this soup as well.",

The recipe is built for convenience and in the spirit of that and what is now available off the shelf in 2018 I really only made two changes. Making the wild rice is definitely time consuming so I used two 8.8 oz Microwavable Packets of wild rice which yielded the 3 cups of cooked rice required. Also in the spirit of convenience I cooked the bacon on a sheet pan in the oven while I saut\u00e9ed the onions in a Half Tablespoon of butter. These two changes did not alter the recipe s flavor at all but definitely made it easier to clean-up and reduced the overall cook time dramatically. As I said we enjoyed this recipe it provides for a great taste and warmth for those chilly nights.",
