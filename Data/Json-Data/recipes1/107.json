With the ground hazelnuts it could be heaven to sandwich 2 with Nutella in the middle!  Or dipped in chocolate as some others suggested...dusted with cinammon, cocoa powder, what ever seems good to you...all kinds of possibilities to play with!  Some additions may change the consistancy somewhat, will have to experiment to find out, but when I do, I'll report in.  Enjoy!!!",
