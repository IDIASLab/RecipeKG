The macadamia nuts and coconut flakes give the cookie a great texture that compliments the oatmeal. What I like about this recipe is that it is egg-free so the batter is definately safe to eat! The time-consuming part of the baking process is placing the dough on the cookie sheets. The dough is crumbly and a bit dry so I recommend rolling the dough into small balls (not too compact) and then flattening them shaping them into circles. The three centimeters for spacing is something that should be taken into consideration because these cookies do spread out quite a bit. I was also told by an Australian friend to let the cookies \"age\" for two or three days to achieve a chewier texture. Happy baking!",
