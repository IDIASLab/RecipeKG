They are heavy but so good! Love them with just butter or with apple butter or maple cream. Got lots of compliments. Today I made a triple batch to use up some cream. I beat my eggs well and added the cream blending well in one bowl dry ingred. in another bowl cut in the butter then combine wet and dry mixed with hands. Divided the dough onto 2 parchment lined sheets and patted into a circle for one and rectangle for the other. Cut into scones. I separated the scones before baking and they came out wonderful. Nicely browned and \"flakey looking\" like layers. I don't top with the egg wash and sugar but I do use 2 T. sugar in the dry ingredients. And I do have to bake 18-20 minutes to get them done in the middles as mine are larger scones. Triple batch gave us 17 scones today. This is our favorite scone recipe at the moment!",
