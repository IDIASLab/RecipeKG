I think this will be as good as the sauce you use for it. I'd recommend a traditional thick sauce. I made the sauce myself to get the taste I wanted. The recipe says to reserve 2 cups of sauce for the top which we thought was odd at the time but soon realized it was a good idea because it prevents the pasta from absorbing the sauce so much. My husband said \"This is great! You've really outdone yourself this time.\" Both of my children enjoyed it and didn't even know they were eating spinach! This tastes a lot like ravioli (which is great because I'm never ever going to stuff little pieces of pasta!) Simple ingredients -- nice change from traditonal pasta dishes.",

I subbed the beef for extra lean ground chicken used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen I also used some of my homemade marinara sauce instead of jarred and 1/2 lb cubed 2% Velveeta cheese. I first sauteed a large onion and a green pepper diced added a pk of fresh mushrooms that I chunked and let that cook for about 5 minutes added the ground chicken and cooked through with salt pepper and garlic powder for flavor. Added the sauce to the meat and veggies and folded that into the cooked shells and added the cheese and spinach. Baked in a large cassrole dish this makes a lot.....leftovers tonight. I also made one more \"better for you\" option and that was to use a bit of olive oil to brown some plain bread crumbs instead of the buttered crumbs that my mom once used to top the casserole. A very hearty full of veggies and lean meat dinner. Family loved it. My point here was to have this great casserole but use lean chicken amp up the veggie factor and still be somewhat fat/calorie conscious while not eliminating flavor. Thanks!",
