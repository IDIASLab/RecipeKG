Fresh arugula Belgian endive cherry tomatoes basil and fresh bocconcini all tossed with a light lemon vinaigrette. I and my taste buds were really enthusiastic. It was beautiful and certainly inviting. Lots of texture and great eye appeal. Two things however disappointed me I love light vinaigrettes but this one fell flat. It needed a boost I added a dab of Dijon and some fresh minced garlic. And I wouldn t THINK of using as much bocconcini called for half a pound of cheese in a salad for two people? I used far less probably 3-4 bocconcini balls per serving. Finally I do like basil but I didn t care for it here it overpowered rather than enhanced the salad. In hindsight I d have left it out. So perk up the dressing go easy on the bocconcini and save the basil for another use and we ve got something here.",

I have yet to find an authentic Italian deli here that sells fresh bocconcini and the prepackaged commercial stuff is flavorless so instead I used crumbled goat cheese which is nice and creamy. Because goat cheese is tangier than mozzarella I subbed balsamic vinegar and a touch of stevia (an herbal sweetener) for lemon juice. Combined with the arugula this made for a very flavorful salad. I omitted the celery doubled the remaining veggies sliced the endive and added the vinegar and oil to taste. A very nice combination of flavors and textures!",
