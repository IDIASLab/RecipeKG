I don't think the cooking time of 45 minutes is enough though. Mine was still quite liquid at 45 minutes. I left it in for 15 more minutes and it seemed fairly set with the extra time but was still a little runny when cut. I liked the edge where it had gotten chewy and firm so for me I think it could bake even longer than an hour until the center looks entirely set..",
