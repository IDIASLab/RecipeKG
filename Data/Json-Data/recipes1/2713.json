Good sweet potatoes don't need that much sweetening. Use part brown sugar and part white sugar to gain the sweetness you like. The topping is different and that is what makes the casserole. I probably add more brown sugar on top with the cruch corn flakes and melted butter and pecans.",

I think I cut back a little on the sugar and the condensed milk but if I did it wasn't by much because I also double the recipe. I added a few things like nutmeg cinnamon and a little OJ/lemon juice which ever I had on hand. It was wonderful I made it for Thanksgiving last year and then was asked to make it again 3 times before Christmas came around. It was a big hit and everyone has already requested it again for this years festivities. Definitely a new holiday tradition for my family and a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!!!!",
