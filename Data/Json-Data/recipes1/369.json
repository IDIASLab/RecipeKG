I did add the Nutmeg and Walnuts (using walnut pieces) then embellished the cookies by cutting Marachino Cherries in half and pressing them into the tops before baking. I do not know why everyone is saying that the dough was \"heavy\" and the cookies still \"doughy.\" Ten (10) minutes was the perfect time for these delicious cookies and the \"heavy\" dough made them easier to drop by spoonfuls onto the baking sheets. I'm an avid baker and cook and this recipe will remain in my Holidays recipes and used for a long time to come. Good one Becky! Thanks!",
