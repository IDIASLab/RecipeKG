I use a large rectangular roasting pan with high (about 4\") sides to do the mixing and a large heavy plastic or wooden spoon.  I got my roaster at Goodwill, the kind that used to come with a new kitchen range.  Just keep turning the whole glob of popcorn and syrup slowly and it will end up evenly coated.  I leave it in the roaster, putting about half of it on a cookie sheet or another roaster (mine has a lid that works well) and put on two racks in the oven.  A large plastic dish pan also works well to mix in--just buy a new dish pan and dedicate for this use.",

Sure it's a bit of work and a bit messy but you'll be glad you took the time. So will friends and family..If you clean your pans while they are still warm washing them up is easier.. Using a popcorn popper takes less time...Sometimes I have only added peanuts. I also use pecan halves rather then pieces.. This last Christmas my husband and I made over 60 little gift bags for his men at his job. He was the big man on campus for a while but never revealed that he had helped make it..He gave all the credit to me....I know you'll enjoy this...go for it..",
