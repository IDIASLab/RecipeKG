I like to serve this with some sliced cucumber and a light chicken soup/broth.  You can carve the bones off and cut the chicken into small pieces before serving or simply serve it whole (and let others do the carving for you!)  It doesn't need any sauce at all.  You can save the juice from baking for stir fry other green vegetables or as a dipping sauce for those who like a stronger taste!",

I prepared it verbatum but I will make the following adjustments next time: more fresh ginger (perhaps 1/2 squeezed for the juice)no chili powder but the addition of hot red pepper flakes (we like our food stompin')I cut up the chicked to permeat the meat more thoroughly. A bit of asian red vinegar seems a fair addition too. As is this is a fine dish for the average palate. Zipping it up with additional vavoom is our option! Thanks Michelle. This was a terrific recipe with a complex and satisfying pan sauce for the addition to rice.",

I did marinate it overnight which I believe was what made it taste so good. I had to cook it for longer than specified as I did have a little bigger chicken. Really really tasty. I paired it with a cold sesame noodle recipe I also got from this site. Super moist and really flavorful. I saved the juice from this chicken as well as the remaining meat to use in a fried rice recipe later this week. My husband was impressed. Way to go Michelle! You rock.",
