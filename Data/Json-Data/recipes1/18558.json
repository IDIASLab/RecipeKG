Although I used a store bought deep dish pie shell....this filling was incredible. Easy and delicious! I too agree that the extra egg yolks made this very rich and creamy. Some pumpkin pies have a bit of a grainy texture....Not this pie, rich, creamy and smooth! I did omit the Chinese 5 spice since I had non on hand....I dont really think it mattered....it was perfectly spiced for us. My family love this pie....it will be my goto pumpkin pie from now on....never again with the evaported milk....its all about the sweetened condensed and the extra yolks. Perfection! Thanks!",

Believe the \"no cracking\" statement because mine came out flawless!  The texture of the pie was spot on, smooth and creamy.  The only change I did was due to not being able to find the chinese 5 spice.  So I just spiced with the normal cinnamon,  pumpkin pie spice, and all spice.  Topped with homemade whipped cream and we've already eaten half the pie!  I would also recommend getting Chef John's pie crust recipe.  It is amazing! (I used that for the pumpkin pie).  The directions call to mix in a food processor, but I don't have one so I just mix it the old fashion way.  Made his crust several times now and turns out perfect every time.  That is my go to crust from now on!  Happy baking!",
