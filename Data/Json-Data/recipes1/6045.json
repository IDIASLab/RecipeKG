Added some peas during the last 10min or so probably about 2teaspoons of poultry seasoning and used 2T of butter(rather than 1 and 1 oil) I used 2 very large leeks 2 celery just the white parts and to be honest if you cut it small enough you'd never know there was leek in there! Everyone cleans off their plate almost to the licking stage. Try to cut your veggies large as you would stew. (2inch potatoes and evenly. Carrots seem to take the longest to cook! I mistakenly added the flour to the broth (well stirred) it was nice and thick! Would make again. Its sort of like a cross between a stew and the inside of potpie:P Love the big chicken breasts rather than cubes as you get a full cut-able serving of meat rather than meat fibers disintegrating in the liquid.",
