                "reviewBody": "I just want to comment on this recipe. I've found several versions on the Internet. Many call for two (21 oz.) cans of pie filling. So the first time I made it, I used two (15 oz.) cans, since that's what my grocery store had. It turned out fine. (My 3-star rating is based on that.) The second time, I went to the supermarket and found the larger cans, so I thought I'd try it with two of the larger cans. It was an utter failure! It rose too high and flopped over the side of the pan, and the center didn't fully cook, even though I left it in for at least 35 minutes. I guess it goes to show that you can't believe everything you read on the Internet! Next time, I'll stick to Allrecipes, where I can read reviews before actually trying a recipe!\n\nNOTE: The other thing I learned is that NOT ALL LEMON PIE FILLINGS ARE CREATED EQUAL! The first time, I bought Duncan Hines/Wilderness Lemon Creme Pie Filling. The second time, I bought the store brand. When I came home, I noticed the ingredients on the store brand didn't even list lemon as an ingredient! At least the DH/Wilderness brand has lemon puree and egg yolks in it! It tasted much more like real lemon and looked more appealing. The store brand tasted like powdered lemonade and was almost a fluorescent yellow! Always check ingredients!!",

It puffed up and ended up being a very dense lemony almost pound cake consistency with a thick lemon pudding middle. I did not know if the insides were supposed to be pudding but it had cooked longer than the specified time and was looking like it might burn on top. Everyone ate it and no one complained but definitely not the lemon bars I was after. Will let my kids make it again because for them it was very easy and did not need a lot of supervision.",
