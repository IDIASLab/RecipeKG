Used 2 diced tomatillos (one large one small) 1 bell pepper split between both and a bit of cayenne to the egg mixture which I whipped separately and poured over the other ingredients (3 eggs each quiche with milk 4 would have spilled over the crust). Added fresh lime juice to onions and let tomatillos sautee for about 1 min. with the onions at the very end of cooking them to reduce the moisture (not big on soggy quiches which is why I didn't add the diced green chilies to the mix) Pressed cheese into crust layered the other ingredients and topped with cheese. Served with fresh avocado and sour cream. Turned out beautifully.",
