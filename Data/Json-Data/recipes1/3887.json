Now, THIS recipe is as good, if not better than Chili's and every other restaurant B & C I've tried.  On the advice of others, I doubled the cheese and the broccoli, used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk and I cut the cheese into small cubes for quick melting.  It was incredible, and I will absolutely be making this soup often.  For family or for guests, watch out--this will knock your socks off!  Word of caution: after cheese has melted, turn stove heat down to low or the cheese will stick to the bottom of pot.",

I only used \u00bd cup of cornstarch and blended it with the soup broth instead of water.  Lastly I used medium cheddar cheese and added it at the very end.    \n\nIf you\u2019re unsure about deviating from the recipe, at least use fresh broccoli and cream or half/half and make sure to add the cheese at the end!

Here's how I altered the recipe - I used 2 lbs velveeta, 1/4 onion, 1/4 cup green pepper, 1/4 cup butter, 8 oz frozen brocolli, 1 can chicken broth, 1/2 cup milk and 1 tsp. minced Garlic.  I didn't need the cornstarch or extra water since I used the crock pot.  \r\nI cubed the velveeta and put it in the crock pot on low.  I sauted the onions, green pepper, and garlic in butter, then added the brcocolli and covered in the chicken broth and milk.  After boiling off some of the liquid in the pan, I added this to the crock pot.  I stirred it together, and let it cook for about 3 to 4 hours on low, stirring at least once an hour.\r\nIt was delicious and my whole family loved it. They are already asking me to make it again.\r\nRemember, if you use the cornstarch to thicken the soup, mix it with the cold milk first then you have to bring it to a boil with the rest of the soup.",

I only used 3 tbls butter to saute the onion (about 1 1/2 C pre-diced-will actually use more next time). I used a bag of frozen and a fresh crown of chopped broccoli. I put all 4 cans of chicken broth in w/the brocolli. I used a pound of 2% Velveeta and a handful of 2% shredded jack cheese. I added a little less than a tbsp garlic powder (and next time I will skip this and saute fresh minced garlic in w/my onions) just under a tbsp worchestershire sauce and a dash of dry mustard. Before I added the cheeses I strained about 1/2 the brocolli mix and pureed before returning to the pot-next time I will puree almost the entire mix (I like more creamy than chunky). I thickened w/BC 4 cheese instant mashed potatoes. Oh and I used fat free evaporated milk instead of regular (though after adding I noticed the expiration date was 09/06....I don't reccomend that!). Served a/a diced tomato garnish and crusty bread. Thanks for a great recipe (and lots of great modifications along the way from reviewers!).",
