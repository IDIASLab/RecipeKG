Then made a guess on how much macaroni this would work for and lastly added some onion til it seemed like a good amount. In the end I used about 3/4 an onion and bit over a pound of macaroni. It really wasn't too bad this way and may be even good with a couple more tweaks but of course it only made what would be the equivalent of 8-10 servings. (I'm pretty open to different opinions about recipes but anyone who gave this a 5 I've got to believe you're a friend of the submitter because there is simply something WRONG with this recipe.)",
