Adjusting the flour make make the bread too light to hold up.\nTraditionally, I make Challah with one huge braid on the bottom and tuck a tiny braid of four strands onto the top.  I also use a bit of yellow food coloring to enhance the 'egg bread' appearance.  Using an egg wash over the top after rising makes the loaf shiny and helps the sesame seeds to stick.\nGreat entry!",

Ease in preparation long-lasting freshness delightful taste and texture have made this a real keeper at my house. What did I do wrong you ask? Well I down-sized it to one loaf but failed to notice that the measurements in the body of the preparation instructions weren't changed. When I saw 'add 1/2 c water ' I did; and then realized I had gone by the original size. Oops! So I changed it to make 2 loaves...mistake # 2 was assuming I had enough flour for the bigger quantity...Had to make a quick run for another bag of the white stuff...despite these 'operator errors ' my bread turned out beautifully and I got rave reviews from all of the friends and family who ate it...even 4 days later. It makes fantastic French toast too. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.",
