So often, as I saw here, it seems one person suggests a rather drastic change and then all others follow suit--and then this changed recipe becomes the recipe being reviewed. I kept all measurements and ingredients as written, only scaling the recipe down to 2 servings as I only wanted to make a nice, little dessert for my husband and me. I found all ingredients and amounts to be dead on, and the custard came together quickly and beautifully. For those having trouble it may just be because they are inexperienced with making custards and could maybe research it a bit to find basic intructions.  For those who ARE experienced, this is a beautiful, rich, smooth and creamy lemon custard that couldn't be more simple to make. And now having made it, let me be the voice of dissent who suggests that this recipe is perfect just as written--no changes necessary. I just served the parfaits topped with fresh whipped cream and a few fresh raspberries. Deliciously good stuff! ",

I gave this a four because most people may enjoy this pie, and I enjoyed the texture and consistency, just not the flavor. The second time I made this I increased the lemon zest to 1T, lemon juice to 2/3c, and sour cream to 1 cup and reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups. Voila! A truly flavorful lemon sour cream pie for those who enjoy lemon and sour cream. Recipes are just road maps for our own creativity. Thanks for providing us with a great road map, Michelle.",

Look at the great variety we get!! Submitters know that people are either going to accept it as is or modify to their taste. How do we benefit? They review the submission & include any modifications they may have done. Who cares if they read the reviews & follow those or follow the recipe exactly as is then read the reviews?? Either way you choose to proceed is your business & not the place for others to criticize. GOSH I'VE BEEN WANTING TO GET THAT OFF MY CHEST I love this recipe! I have made this numerous times and made the following changes: milk 1 1/2 c sour cream 1 c lemon juice 2/3 c & zest 1T. I've made this a couple of times w/o the zest & compensated w/lemon extract but it was nowhere near as good as when you add the zest. When I tell others about this pie I ltell them the zest is a must.:-)",

Had no trouble with it being too runny - be sure you continue to cook for the specified amount of time and you will be fine. Mine got very thick and would probably have been fine with the full amount of milk. I made another lemon pie (Bill Clinton's Lemon Chess Pie from this site) for my husband to take to work because I had slightly burnt the shell on this one (not paying attention) but I should have sent this one; it was MUCH better. Next time I'd make a double batch. My only gripe: what do I do with the egg whites that are left over? I don't feel inclined to make meringue.:-P",
