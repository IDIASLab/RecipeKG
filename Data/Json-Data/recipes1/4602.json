I did not do as some chose to do, chop up fruit smaller.  Keeping fruit big lets you know your biting into fruit.  If smaller, then you only get the essense of flrui flavor, not true fruit.  Wow!

She didn't have fancy ingredients or even the time to decorate her creations artfully but she made wonderful treats like this to make memories. My hubby is a diabetic so I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and substituted the rest of the sugar with Truvia baking blend. No other changes. They turned out perfect in spite of me.

My only issue with this recipe is that it's really kind of a mess chopping up the fruit (the fruit's way too big to not chop up) and mixing it into the batter is a difficult and slimy experience. I used almonds instead of walnuts. I'd try these next time with some coconut flakes baked into the batter or on top.",
