I made the mistake of paying attention only to some of the 5-star reviews and not the more accurate 1-star reviews, which are VERY accurate. I agree with them completely that the mayonnaise is WAY overwhelming, Worcestershire doesn't really have a place here, the garlic is overwhelming too, and it's too thick. I tried my best to doctor it up by adding some buttermilk but, alas, the damage was already done. A horrible waste of good ingredients, particularly expensive Blue cheese. I'll stick to the one I simply throw together myself with equal parts sour cream and buttermilk,  and a LITTLE mayo. (Also, for those who are interested, salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste, a pinch of sugar, and a LITTLE splash of white vinegar)",

When making dont skimp on a purchasing a good blue cheese because it makes all the difference in the world.  Also, I have read some complaints about this recipe from other reviewers.  Some state that it has too much mayo.  It does have a \"mayo\" taste when you first mix it all together but your not suppose to eat it right away!  Let is sit for at lease six hours, or make it the night before like I do.  Also,  yes, worchestire is in the dressing, I hate it by itself, but cant taste it when it is combined with everything.  So people quite your whinning!  Follow the directions, and let it so over night so it can work its magic.  My favorite way to eat it....with grilled jerk chicken wings:)",

Everyone has their own opinion but mine is WOW! First, you have to let this sit to \"meld\" the flavors. I'm not sure why people say they only taste mayo...maybe you need a better blue cheese. I also have never had this \"thin out\". Not sure why others did..quality of ingredients maybe? This is my recipe I have used for years! Originally called \"Chart House blue cheese\" from a restaurant in NYC. Flavor increases as it sets! Make it at least the day before using. The original recipe calls for 1/3 tsp garlic powder, which I use. I only add salt after it sits because the blue cheese can be salty. I use this as a dressing, or for as a dip for vegetables or for a sturdy chip or pretzel.",
