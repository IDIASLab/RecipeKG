                "reviewBody": "UPDATE 07/2008:  I've been making this for 4 years now, and have a tip for you.  I clean and trim 2 \"super-club paks\" of chicken and put 5-6 pieces into four separate ziplocs.  I double the marinade, divide it evenly into each of the bags, stick one bag in the fridge to marinate for dinner, and the other 3 into the freezer.  Next time I need chicken to grill, I grab one of these and let it thaw in the marinade - Fast and fabulous!! END. This name should be changed to \"Easiest Ever Super Tasty Grilled Chicken\"!!  I have to admit, I was concerned that this might be bland since the marinating time was so short, but I was delightfully surprised.  My 9 year old (who \"hates spicy food\") proclaimed that it was one of his favorite meals.  If you're a working mother, this is one of those last minute no brainer meals.  If you're like me, and you didn't have time to put something in the crockpot in the morning, or you forgot to marinate something overnight, this is the recipe for you!!  And once you have all those spices on hand, you'll have them for a while, so you won't likely to be short an ingredient.   This is one of our new standbys!!!  Now, if I can just rack up a few more of those... !",

I added 5 BLSL chicken thighs to the marinade.  Baked it in a foil lined 9X13 pan at 450 degrees for 35+ minutes.  This was served over baby spring mix, tomato wedges, and chopped veggies.  We bought some cajun seasoning when we were on vacation in New Orleans, so our chicken had some kick, but not too much.  This tasted salty, even though I didn't add any additional salt, so keep that in mind.  Thanks for sharing your great recipe, Wood!",
