There is no such thing as a 2 pound chicken in my area as the smallest are always over 4 pounds. Cornish would have worked but they are too expensive just to shred for soup so I used bone in chicken breast and that was the one change I made. Because I was making this ahead for work lunches, I did not garnish with avocado and I honestly didn't miss it. Loved the addition of olives and this is one I would make again.",
