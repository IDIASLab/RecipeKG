Seafood chowder has always been my favorite, so when I found this unique recipe, I was really hoping that it would be as fantastic as others said it was. This recipe didn\u2019t let me down. It was outstanding. I added two extra strips of bacon simply because, well, it\u2019s yummy. I also added the entire 12 ounce can of evaporated milk and then added some Idahoan flavored mashed potato flakes until the chowder was the thickness that I desired. Yum!",

I used frozen corn rather than canned and a full can of evaporated milk. Also it would serve no more than 4 to 6 at least in our house. As one reviewer suggested this is excellent with the Cheddar Bay biscuits found on this site. Also I like to crunch up the dry scalloped potatoes when they are still in the plastic wrap--makes for smaller chunks of potato.",

It gives the dish a great depth and flavor. My husband likes it even better the next day with a french bagette for dipping.",

I made only minor changes at least I thought they were minor. I used homemade fish stock rather than chicken broth. I don t know that this made a big difference but I used a halibut frame and the usual veggies etc. to make the broth. This is something we keep in the freezer so if you don t have it no big deal. The other change was using fresh dill as suggested by another reviewer. One final change might have been the salmon used. Being the season I bought fresh Copper River salmon. I suspect that any fresh salmon would be as good. I plan on trying it with farmed Atlantic salmon just to see how it is. I really think you could use almost any seafood for this but what a great way to use small salmon chunks!",
