I did not have parsley for the filling, so I used oregano instead (I prefer this herb anyway).  The bread had a wonderful texture and the crust was delicate and just a bit flaky.  The taste was sensational, not over-powering but very flavorful.  I ate a third of the loaf hot out of the oven and the rest was the next days breakfast and lunch.  It was great cold and reheated nicely.  I will be making this again for company and for myself.  Aronna Palmer, you have found a truly beautiful recipe.
