I did use an extra egg in the batter by accident but they were so light and puffy that I would do the same again. I also rolled mine in powdered sugar instead of flour for just a touch more sweetness. My children LOVE these and I didn't expect them to since they are not very sweet. Hint: Bake just until edges are set for light soft cookies; do not brown.",
