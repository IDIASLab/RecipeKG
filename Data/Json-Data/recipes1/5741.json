I had more luck (less mess) when I let the dough sit in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes before I rolled them into balls. I rolled mine in chocolate jimmies, cocoa, coconut, crushed candy canes. So easy and  very tasty",

I highly suggest adding the rum to taste in case you want more rum flavor and then add the cream a little at a time for the correct consistency. I used condensed milk because I didn't have heavy cream and I also added some unsweetened cocoa powder for more chocolate flavor. 1 cake makes about 3 batches of this recipe so I had some to play with. I made one batch substituting pumpkin for the chocolate and bourbon for the rum. I rolled the balls in coconut. YUM!!!",
