Also added some chopped carrots for color and flavor.  Only added about 1/2tsp of pepper and no extra salt, just the boullion.  I like my potatoe soup a little bit thicker than it turned out.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong with the flour mixture or if it's just a thinner broth.  So I mashed the veges real lightly with potatoe masher and added instant mashed potatoe flakes to thicken it up a bit!  Wonderful recipe!",

I'm always looking for ham recipes, as I often buy a half fully cooked ham, cube, and divide up into freezer bags for quick meals. Making the white sauce separately really added the right creaminess to the potato/ham & veggie mixture. I used a can of chicken broth for part of the liquid, as I didn't have any bullion. Also threw in some shredded carrots I had on hand, plus 1/2 cup shredded cheese to the white sauce after it had thickened. Also, (to disguise the carrots), added a sprinkle of cheese to each bowl upon serving. Very creamy and tasty. I'll definitely make again, possibly adding corn next time.",

I LOVE my crockpot and use it constantly!  I sauted the onions in a little vegetable oil until soft, added all the ingredients except the butter/flour and milk to the crockpot and cooked all day until the potatoes were nice and soft.  I also added one diced carrot.  About an hour before dinner I made the rue with the flour and butter and used a 12 oz. and 5 oz. can of evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  I don't like to use regular milk in crockpot recipes because it sometimes curdles on me.  I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder to the soup, it just seemed like it needed a little something when I tasted it before serving.  Topped each bowl of soup with fresh ground pepper and sliced green onions.  This soup is rich, thick and creamy.  Very hearty and filling, perfect for a cold winter night meal!  My family really enjoyed this served with a homemade cheesy garlic pizza.",

Very risky to bring something as a gift for a whole family, especially if you have never tested the recipe, but this was a home run!  The ham really made this special and oh so good.  I used far less salt, didn't measure, just to taste.  Since different hams have different salt content, I highly recommend tasting first.  Also, I used a little over 1 TBSP of boullion because I wanted the great taste of ham to come through.  I cooked this on the stove and then put in my crockpot to keep warm and make travelling and reheating easy.  Perfect!  Thanks for such a great recipe!",

The only changes I made was to add a few extra cups of chicken broth in addition to the water and boullion because I think I went a little overboard on the potatoes and needed more liquid.  I also found that turning the heat up to med-high while stirring the butter, flour and milk mixture helped it to thicken more quickly.  I added some cheddar cheese while stirring the sauce and then topped the bowls with a little more.  Thanks for an easy and absolutely scrumtious recipe, my husband will be asking for this often!",

I wish I would have used a more conservative approach with the pepper because it overpowered everything.  Anyway, I made the recipe \"as is\" and tasted it.  Then I decided to add extra ham and some cheese for additional flavor.  I used 8 oz of colby jack cheese, but think that an extra sharp cheddar would have been much better.  I don't think I'll make this again.",
