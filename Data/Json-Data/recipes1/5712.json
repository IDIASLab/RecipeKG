Some adjustments: Cooked on stove- started by sauteing some chopped onion then chopped red pepper (about 1/4 cup each) and clove of garlic before adding the water and all other items (left out sugar). Also used a chunky salsa and didn't strain it- left chunks in. Noticed I had some leftover corn so tossed a bit of that in too. Let simmer for probably 30 mins as prepared some cornbread to go with the meal. Used a submersible stick blender to puree bulk of soup. Flexitarian daughter went back for seconds before even having any cornbread! I didn't care for the cherry tomatoes so next time will instead use diced tomato in lieu of them. I'm not very creative in the kitchen to concoct my own recipe so this was a solid foundation to work with. Thanks Corwynn!",

Also I used garlic powder onion powder and red pepper flakes. after blending it all i put it in a small sauce pot and let it boil a little. i dont know why it says to dump the salsa guts thats the good part! also add sour cream and shredded cheese when serving hot and viola! also im thinking about simmering it for a while next time so it is thicker and can be used for a bean dip. Maybe adding some ground turkey? or refried beans? Thanks for the idea!",
