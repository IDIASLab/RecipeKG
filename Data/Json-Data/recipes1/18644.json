I made the sauce and the spice mix the night before which worked out wonderfully on the busy day. I followed this to the letter and I wouldn't change a thing about them- the flavor combination is out of this world the spice level is just about perfect the crispy crunchy exterior is the perfect housing for the tender potato within. The sauce is just lovely and would be wonderful on many things. I debated on buying yet another vinegar but am so happy I did not try to substitute anything else for the sherry vinegar- it is worth it to buy yourself a bottle if you don't keep it on hand. My boyfriend thinks me a kitchen super star- we devoured these with gusto! Thanks Chef John!",

Make the dipping sauce first (even a day ahead) and let it sit to marry flavors.\n2. You can cook the potatoes ahead of time. Just make sure they are dry when you put in oil.\n3. Taste the fried potatoes as you add the seasoning after frying. I did not use all of the seasoning mixture to avoid over-saltiness.\n\nThis recipe is authentic and the sauce tastes just like I had in Barcelona and all over Catalonia.  No stars for healthiness, but 5 starts for taste. YUM!",

I've learned to also do steps 3 and 4 first then step 1 and 2 then step 5. In my opinion it makes more sense to do steps 1 and 2 while the potatoes go through their 45 min cool down.
