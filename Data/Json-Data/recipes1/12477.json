Just a couple of things though: the amount of breading is enough for three preparations of this recipe (this isn't a guess I actually used it three times... I divided it up before I breaded the fish 'cause you don't want to use breading that's touched the fish obviously). I kept the extra breading in the fridge b/c of the parmesan. Also you can use regular milk instead of evaporated and much less melted butter than the recipe calls for (I think I used 1/4 cup). This recipe was great on red snapper as well! My little girls LOVE this recipe.",
