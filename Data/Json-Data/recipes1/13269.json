                "reviewBody": "My husband loved this. It took a bit longer to bake than the recipe stated (10 minutes longer is usual in my oven but this took almost 20) because the middle of the cake was not set. It puffed up very nicely around the blueberries on top. I used frozen blueberries because that is what I had on hand. I tossed them in a little flour to keep the juices from discoloring the cake. They worked beautifully. One problem I had was that I couldn't get the topping to form a crumb-like consistency. I think I probably should have added flour to the mixture but I topped the cake before I thought of it. It was still delicious but not quite what I had in mind. The texture and flavor of the cake was very good and because it used no dairy (or very little because the sour cream substitute did have whey as an ingredient -- I used IMO brand) and no eggs my husband can enjoy it without any unpleasant repercussions. He gave it 5 stars I gave it 4 because of the slight difficulties I listed above and because the recipe requires sifting ingredients twice (first the flour then the flour again with the other dry ingredients). I hate sifting so I sifted the flour with the other ingredients once and it still came out plenty good.",

Being allergic to dairy I'm limited in what pastries I can have since many seem to contain milk or sour cream etc. But this vegan coffee cake is fabulous! I'm not much of a baker so if I can successfully pull this off anyone should be able to. LOL The dry egg replacer ingredient confused me so what I did was use 2 T ground flax seed & 6 T water (the equivalent of 2 eggs) which worked out just fine. A previous reviewer mentioned adding cinnamon to the batter to enhance that flavor throughout the cake so I'll try that next time. I think this recipe would be fabulous for both vegans & non-vegans. I look forward to trying it with different fruit toppings as well but the blueberries were delicious.",
