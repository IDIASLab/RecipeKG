I turned the heat off immediately after adding the seafood and removed it after 3 minutes. Then I added some shrimp shells to the cooking water, reduced the seafood cooking water down to 2 cups, to make a more concentrated broth, strained it and used all of that and cut back on the milk called for by 1 cup. (thus 2 cups milk/2 cups reduced seafood broth... resulting in a much more veloute-like and less bechamel-like sauce) Using Monterey Jack cheese, much lighter in flavor, also created an overall lighter taste to the dish, without overpowering the seafood.\r\n\r\nI omitted the flounder and added more scallops. Next time I will try monkfish, which has a texture very much like lobster and holds together nicely when cooked.\r\n\r\nSince many have mentioned how good it tastes leftover/reheated, I made this in the morning, chilled it, brought it to room temp. prior to reheating and made my and my guests dinner experience much more relaxed. I served it over white rice along with lightly steamed asparagus and passed warmed homemade bread. Yummy!",

My family and I thought it was very good but too pasty.  I think if the flour were maybe a 1/4 cup less and cooked for less time then the recipe suggests, it wouldn't come out so pasty like.  All in all though, very good.  I changed the seafood a little and didn't use fillet bits but 1 lb of shrimp, 1lb of lump crab and 1lb of scallops.  I also served it over rice and steamed broccoli.  Also, the recipe took more than 20 minutes to prepare...more like 30+ for me because of peeling the shrimp prior to mixing all the seafood with the other ingredients.  It is an expensive dish as other reviews have suggested but it's worth it and definitely something to serve when you have dinner guests.",

I do not like flounder so I used tilapia because I had some in the freezer and bay scallops because they're smaller and more flavorful. To reiterate what others have said it takes longer than 20 minutes I'd allow an hour for preparation plus 30 minutes bake time. I had no trouble with the sauce at all it turned out very rich creamy and silky smooth and I used 1% milk. It takes about 15 minutes to get the onion and pepper caramelized properly and about 10 minutes simmer for the white sauce before adding the cheese etc. Keep stirring and it will thicken! A basic knowledge of making roux is the key to good sauce. I used 3 cans of crabmeat not fresh. I served with homemade garlic basil breadsticks a tossed salad and white wine. Superb!

Yes it is expensive but good seafood makes all the difference. And it is still cheaper than eating in a restuarant! My whole family (inlcuding my 2 year old and 3 1/2 year old) finished their plates and my husband had 2 huge servings. It takes alot of work so definitely give yourself the extra time but it is well worth it. I rate it 5 stars for a home cooked meal. It isn't a 5 star quality restuarant meal but I'm not a 5 star restaurant chef and it is one of the best things I've ever made at home.",

He's a picky eater and I can always tell teh success of a meal by how many helpings he has. He had 3 with this meal. To make things easy use canned crab (3 Diamond brand best). It tastes just as good and costs a lot less. I added garlic to the peppers and onions for added flavor. Use pre-cooked shrimp to speed things up a little and this way you don't run the risk of making the shrimp curled and tough by overcooking it. I used jalapeno pepperjack cheese in lieu of cheddar and topped it with a mixture of parmesean and bread crumbs. My kitchen smelled wonderful while this was cooking! My family has a new favorite recipe. Although you use a lot of dishes making this its okay because all you need to go along with it is salad and bread. I served mine over rice pilaf. Although it could also make a hearty stew served in a bread bowl too. Similar to seafood newburgh.",

I did have to make a couple of substitutions; canned crabmeat and orange roughy instead of flounder. And I will definetely buy prepared shrimp! I had some problems with the flour sauce thickening and I'm not sure the dish even set right (it took almost twice as long cooking time before the top browned). But it still tasted wonderful and it's definetly something I'd like to try again.",

I used the canned Phillips crabmeat and I also omitted the fish but followed the recipe exactly. I think the Cheese did not go well with the seafood combination. May have been better with a wine sauce instead. I also used the bags of Med. Frozen Shrimp so maybe I should have used all FRESH seafood instead?",
