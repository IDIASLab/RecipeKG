To give the flavor even more depth, I slightly toasted the pecans in the oven while it was preheating. I tried the cookie with and without the glaze. I preferred the glazed. Since these cookies start out light brown, it was hard to tell by sight when they were done. I cooked the first batch a little too long. So follow the cooking time on the recipe and they should turn out great!",

I wanted to keep them, they were SO GOOD! Browning butter can be tricky, but it's important to cook the butter until dark flecks appear in the pan to give these cookies maximum flavor. I toasted whole pecans, finely chopped a heaping 2/3 cup for the dough,and used a whole pecan for the top of each cookie after they were iced. I made a couple of sandwich cookies by icing two cookie bottoms and putting them together, but the single cookies with icing and a pecan were the favorite. These were a gift for a picky professional chef (boy, was I nervous?!) and he LOVED them. Thank you, Heather, for your outstanding recipe!",

It took longer than five minutes, foamed plenty then subsided, boiled, then foamed again before turning \"nutty and brown\".  You have to stir in order to see the color through the foam.  Great recipe!  It didn't quite make 50 and next time I'll roll them a little smaller for a bit daintier cookie.  I didn't use all the hot water for the glaze--just add it slowly until the desired consistency is reached.  Try this recipe!  Your pound of butter will not be used in vain!",

I did think they were a little too sweet and that the brown sugar overpowered the taste of the brown butter (by the way, it took more like 10-13 minutes for that quantity of butter to reach the desired brownness in a 3-qt saucepan).  When I make these again, I am going to use white sugar (and less of it) so that the brown bits in the butter show throughout the cookie and the flavor of the brown butter will (hopefully) be more pronounced.  Even with these minor tweaks to suit my own personal preferences, the recipe as-is is superb, thanks for sharing!",
