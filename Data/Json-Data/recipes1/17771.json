This is so moist and flavorful the only change I made was to use a whole chicken split in half and weigh the chicken down with tinfoil covered bricks while grilling. The extra weight flattens the chicken for better grill marks and a more even cooking surface. Thanks for the Cherry BOMB Chicken BTW...if you have leftovers pull the chicken and add a little bbq sauce for an awesome bbq chicken on a bun meal completed with beans and slaw.",

I used 4 chicken breasts instead and wasn't up to firing up the grill so I baked them instead. 450 degree oven 35-40 min depending on the thickness of your chicken. Another tip that I always use is to place a wire rack in my roasting pan. This elevates the chicken for better circulation and produces crispier skin. I am always on the look out for great brine recipes and this one qualifies. Love the allspice flavor.",

Don't be afraid to use 3 Habanero peppers in the marinade - however DO use gloves while handling to remove the seeds. Look for fresh flavorful cherry tomatoes it makes a difference. I followed the instructions in the video and used Red Pepper Jelly on top at the end. My dinner guests raved about the chicken. Will definitely make again! Amazing!",
