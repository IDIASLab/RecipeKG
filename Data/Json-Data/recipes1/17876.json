I added some crushed red pepper, that was the only change I made. I did not add the jalapeno peppers to the saucepan, I went ahead and put them in the canning jar and once the vinegar mixture came to a boil, I poured it over the peppers in the jar, put a lid on it and let it sit like that for ten minutes before refrigerating. I have not used them yet as I want them to sit in the vinegar for a week or two to really get good. I'll update my review once I've had a chance to try them. Five stars for this recipe for just being awesome. I am so tickled I could make my own. VERY easy.",

This recipe solved my problem.  Like another review I cut the sugar in half to keep more heat and placed them directly in jars and poured the liquid over.  I also added about 1 teaspoon of tumeric- it helped keep them teally green.  Five dollars bought me about five pounds at the farmers market and made four quarts; I used four cups each of vinegar and water and it was the perfect amount.  Thanks for sharing chg John!",
