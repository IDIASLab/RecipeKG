I don't know how you could get enough out of this recipe to use half for the crust and half for topping. It has to be miswritten. My modifications: I toasted the pecans for a more intense flavor. I also toasted some coconut and ground it up in my food processor and added that in. The nuts and coconut came out to about 3/4 cup so I decreased the flour by 1/4 cup. That was a good change and was awesome with coconut cream pie.",
