Before adding the whipped cream filling I brush the interior side of the cake with rum (enough to soak through a little but not so much to make the whole cake soggy). I also add more rum to the filling. As other reviewers have mentioned I too had a hard time finding toffee (without chocolate) so I used Werther's Originals. As a tip if you are baking and you recipe calls for just a little bit of alcohol (such as this one) you can usually go to a well stocked liquer or party store and buy the mini airplane bottles for 1- 3. It is so much more reasonable than buying a 40 of alcohol that you won't use for a couple of tablespoons!",

I did find the gelatin mixed with the rum part was a bit tricky and I boshed that a bit so I added whip cream from a container and an extra tablespoon of the rum to cover my mistake...no problems it worked great! I'm making this again at Christmas for a party and I am going to omit the gelatin part altogether and save the hassle since no one even noticed anyway and everyone loved it last time. It's a keeper!!! Thanks! I thought it would take time to make this recipe by the way I had to send my hubby out for a missing ingredient too and was cutting it close to when it should be done so when I finally was able to begin I was amazed at how fast I was able to put this together. Looks like a lot of work soooo easy though!! forgot to brush the cake with rum too like someone suggested I think that will be great! I will have to write it into the recipe so I won't forget. the cake part...must use cake flour...it's so flexable. Otherwise it will definately break when rolling. Yummo!",
