However, with the help of other reviewers - it becomes one of the best enchilada sauces EVER.\r\n\r\nFirst off, I used half California Chili Powder and half New Mexico Chili Powder (available in the Mexican food section of your grocery store in little baggies.)  I used chicken broth instead of water, 8 oz. of tomato sauce instead of 4 oz, and added 1 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. cumin, and 2 tsp. turbinado sugar.  I made beef enchiladas and they were AWESOME!\r\n\r\nSo don't be afraid to try this recipe - just doctor it up a bit!",

I am quite experienced in Mexican cooking & I use a home made chili powder so cut down the amount of chili powder to 3 tbsp. But for the less experienced cook may take a little time adjusting the amount to their particular taste. This is definately a recipe one should try if they want a true home made Mexican enchilada sauce.  It is well worth the effort of experimenting with various chili powders.  Once one masters this part of the recipe it is really easy to make.",

Get a good quality chili powder and add slowly to get to your liking. I use 2 C low sodium chicken broth instead of water.Gives a richer flavor. I use 10 oz. tomato paste,1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp. ground cumin and 1/2 tsp salt. Cook oil and flour 1 min. add chili powder and cook 30 seconds. add rest of ingredients and cook 10-15 min. This makes a bit thicker sauce and is really good. Thanks Brenda!",

I took the advice from another review- using 3TBS oil (but I used butter instead) and 1 TBS flour but I sauteed some minced garlic in the butter first then instead of 1/4 can tomato sauce I used 1/2 can. I was so scared I was going to have to throw out my veggie and chicken enchiladas but not only did it taste wonderful my husband had three servings that night then polished of the rest the next day. I only got to have one serving! He said it was better than the can kind! I'll be making it again this week. Thanks so much for the recipe and the tips! Just a note even if it doesn't taste that great by itself it's incredible when on your enchilads.",

Like others I used chicken broth. I used crushed garlic. But most importantly I used El Pato Jalapeno tomato sauce and a can of Herdez red salsa. I was a little hesitant to use the Jalapeno tomato sauce since it is very hot and hubby hollers when I use it in anything (and he's of Mexican heritage go figure.) I would have used El Pato hot style tomato sauce (in the yellow can) but didn't have any. But actually with the chicken broth and water it was perfect and hubby really liked it. Oh and come to think of it I didn't double the chili powder! An oversight on my part while I was doubling the recipe. Thanks Brenda. I will no longer use the can or packaged stuff and the ingredients are things I almost always have in my kitchen.",
