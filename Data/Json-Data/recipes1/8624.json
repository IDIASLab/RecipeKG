I used lamb meat, added minced green pepper and ground cumin and garlic. This certainly make the dish more middle eastern in taste. And, word to the wise on the egg roll wrappers. It's best to either totally cool the meat before you put it in the egg roll wrappers or make only a couple at a time then fry them. They tend to really stick together and get wet if the mixture is hot.",
