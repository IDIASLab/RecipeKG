If you like clam chowders and are willing to splurge for a night I'd say make this EASY & Quick (did I mention delicious?) soup!! It literally took me 25 min from start to finish!! Oh- in addition to the shrimp I added a can of drained clams and added the milk to our preferred consistency! Thanks Suzanne for this great recipe - and for temporarily increasing my dress size!!

I used full-lead butter but the lower fat neufchatel cheese to cut out a little of the calories. I also used a can of sweet corn undrained which isn't specified one way or the other in the recipe. I ended up using 1 1/2 cups of 1% milk to get the perfect consistency for our tastes. I also cooked it a little longer than recommended after I added the shrimp as they seemed undercooked to me straight out of the bag. I wanted to taste the recipe as listed so I didn't add any seasonings until after it was in the bowl. We like a little more flavor so I would say adding some hot red pepper flakes a little sea salt and fresh ground pepper really took it over the top. This is one of those dishes you can't make too often 'cause it's not the healthiest thing you'll ever eat but the flavor is company-worthy fantastic so we will be treating ourselves to this awesome soup as often as our waist lines will allow.

I made it almost exactly as written only changing a few things: to cut down on the fat I used 1/2 the amount of butter and reduced-fat cream cheese. Also based on what other reviewers suggested I added a bottle of clam juice with a can of crab meat before simmering. This was still very rich very tasty and made plenty for our family of 4 (three of whom... the guys... are big eaters). Serve with crackers and a salad and there's dinner!",
