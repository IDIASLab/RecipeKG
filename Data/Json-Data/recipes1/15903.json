I\u2019ve only tasted it or made it myself on one other occasion, a recipe from this site.  Looking back at that recipe that I rated four stars, in my mind I overrated it. I didn\u2019t find anything memorable about it and wondered why Red Velvet Cake was so popular \u2013 it wasn\u2019t much on flavor, frankly.  A friend even suggested that the Duncan Hines Red Velvet cake mix was infinitely better than any scratch Red Velvet Cake she\u2019d ever made \u2013 but I\u2019ll bet she never tried this one!  This is moist, fluffy, pleasantly sweet and chocolaty \u2013 the other is mediocre by comparison.  Bonus that a very good cream cheese frosting recipe is included.",
