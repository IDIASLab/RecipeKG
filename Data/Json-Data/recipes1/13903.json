First of all, an absolute MUST, is baking the pie crust for 8-10 mins before filling otherwise you end up with a soggy bottom. Cover the edges with tin foil or a pie edge cover because they WILL burn by the end of baking, specially at that temp. As for the temp, I would reduce it to 400F next time, which is plenty hot enough to bake a quiche. I did add some onions that I softened in the microwave and some garlic powder - I would add more next time. Also, I would change up the cheese and do a mixture of cheeses like cheddar, mozza, parm, and asiago. The milk and cream need to be reduced to allow the egg to set properly - I would reduce the milk and cream both to 3/4 cup EACH. The next time I make this with the changes I've noted, I will update.",

I would have preferred the texture a bit firmer (so I guess cooked longer).  Also next time, I might try to add spinach or onion or a different kind of cheese.  It was a little mild in flavor.  Also, the milder flavors taste better when it isn't so hot out of the oven.",

This is probably my favorite recipe off this site to date.  I wouldn't change a thing as far as the recipe goes but definitely, when you're making something so focused on the cheese I would splurge and buy a really high quality sharp cheddar from Trader Joe's or an equivalent.
