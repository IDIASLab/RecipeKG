I can imagine, however, the crunchiness from the nuts would have been a great addition. I also used yellow peppers in replacement of the celery.  I've never tried tuna salad with sour cream, so this was an interesting taste.  Next time, I would probably add less of both the sour cream and the mayo as it was a bit too creamy for me.  Overall, I quite enjoyed it.",
