The recipe as is has a thinner consistency and isn't overly spicy. I added up to 1/2 tsp of cayenne to make it spicier, but what make it out of this world was 1/4 cup corn meal!!! Made it thick like chili you would get in a restaurant. This recipe makes a lot so you can freeze half if need be and is absolutely delicious!!!",

It'll clear your sinuses, but you won't be gulping down milk to cool your tongue!  This recipe heats up well in the microwave, and freezes just fine - we've got three meal's worth in the deep freeze right now.  By all means, give this chili recipe a try, I'm sure you'll like it.",

The end result was the best chili I have ever made!!  I used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb sausage to give a little more depth to the flavor.  I also followed the advice of others and substituted the tomato juice with tomato sauce and the tomato sauce with diced tomatoes.  I didn't realize that I was almost out of chili powder until I had already started the chili, so I only used about 1 T and added hot sauce (tobasco) in place of the rest of the chili powder.  I used one can of chili beans (with liquid) and one can kidney beans (rinsed).  I followed the rest of the seasonings.  It only took about 15 minutes to put together, then I let it simmer for about 2 hours.  Served with sour cream, cheese, fresh chopped tomatoes and corn chips.  I will make this recipe over and over again.  I have never received so many compliments - on anything I have ever made!!",

I use 1 can of kidney beans, one of pinto and one of black (all rinsed) in leiu of one of the lbs of beef, thus cutting down on the sat. fat and red meat content. Doubled the cumin because I like the smokiness. I also added one hot jalepeno without the seeds, diced, or cayenne pepper. I throw it all in the crockpot and let it cook for about 4 hours.

I would encourage everyone to double check the age of the spices they're using.  If they're over a year old, you probably need to pump it up a little as spices lose their punch as they age.  I recently noticed a jar of chili powder at my mother's that was probably at least 10 years old.  She didn't see the problem with that.  The problem with that is that she's basically adding slightly flavored dust to her recipes...yuk!  I used fresh spices for this chili and it turned out perfectly tasty and spicy.\n\nUpdate:  I've been making this recipe consistently for a few years now, and I've found that I'm happiest when I double the beans (Sorry, serious chili lovers), and increase the amount of all the vegetables, plus add 1/4 cup corn meal to thicken it up.  Nevertheless, this recipe is a great starting point that is easy to tweak to your satisfaction.",
