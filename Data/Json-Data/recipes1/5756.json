I appreciated the hint to cut the carrots, celery and onions in half. I had always cut them up in small pieces, and then when I would drain the broth, it was messy to try to retrieve the cut up veggies to put them back in the broth. This is so much easier! When I drain the broth, I place a paper towel in the sieve. It makes for a nice clear broth. I also cook up some noodles to add to the soup. I do not like to add the noodles directly to the pot of soup, because the noodles will aborb too much of the broth.",

I used about 2 1/2 lbs. of cut up chicken and used 4 packets of Goya Chicken Bouillon and I think that probably was the secret to seasoning this soup.  I used baby carrots and put two whole (scrubbed with the peel on) potatoes in the bottom of the pot with chicken.  I followed the instructions and let it cook, took the chicken off the bone and returned everything to the pot after I cut up the veggies.  I then added some frozen vegetable soup cut veggies (celery, peas, onion, potatoes, okra, etc.) and ditalini pasta.  My son has a cold and this soup really hit the spot with him, even in 110 degree weather! I really recommend this soup recipe!  I put half in individual containers in our freezer and my son, who wants soup every day, will be set for at least a few days!",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is very tasty though it is also very basic - which is perfect for the beginner chef.  Once you begin to \"doctor\" your own recipes, you will see that the more flavors you add to chicken broth, the better. For example, why stop with carrots and celery? In addition to these things, I add a potato, tomato, fresh basil, fresh parsley, red peper, onion, etc... Make sure to be generous with the salt as stock can be quite bland unless seasoned appropriately. I even use a couple of bay leaves and a couple of peppercorns during the cooking process.  Bring the liquid to a boil, then turn the heat down and simmer. I use a lid on my soup to keep evaporation to a minimim, though I \"vent\" the lid with a wooden spoon during cooking (kind of props up the lid) so that it isn't completely sealed shut...  Add water 1/2 way through cooking if necessary.  Boullion is OK, but not necessary if you have the appropriate blend of chicken, veggies and herbs.  Serve with rice or your noodle of choice.  Never cook noodles in the broth - always in a separate pot because the starch will ruin your soup. The more you times you make this recipe, the more you will enjoy it - as it is definitely a process of trial and error. ENJOY!",
