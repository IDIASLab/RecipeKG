I added a few dashes of nutmeg cayenne and onion power and black pepper. On top of the breadcrumbs I did sprinkle paprika and parsley as taken from another reviewer. Delicious and makes a lot!",

I didn't really get what it meant by \"steam\" the slaw...steam it like you do to veggies or put it in the pan? Well I chose the latter only instead of water I used some chicken broth (just barely enough to cover the bottom of the pan). I sprinkled some garlic/onion powder over the cabbage as well for extra taste. Funny thing the recipe doesn't state what to do with the ham but luckily I'm a smart woman so I layered it over the cabbage. The cheese sauce is a small pain if your not patient and it is a little too much but overall this was very good. I used season bread crumbs and it was a good stick-to-your-ribs meal! Thanks Jeanie!",

I let the cabbage/onion cook down in 1 cup of chicken broth added the ham (to warm it up) then strained the whole thing prior to putting in the buttered dish. That worked well as there was a tiny bit more liquid formed in the bottom of dish during the baking period. Had i not drained the original liquid it would have turned out too watery. The topping was awesome! i didn't have velveta so i mixed the butter/flour mixture added the milk then about 1 cup of shredded mild cheddar and it melted perfectly... layered over the top and baked w/ the bread crumbs and dotted w/ butter as directed. Was a TOTAL HIT!!! We will eat this often!!! ENJOY!",
