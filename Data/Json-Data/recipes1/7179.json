I added pepper to my taste. (a lot more than called for) I then drained and put in my crock along with 1 lg. can of mushroom soup (instead of mushrooms)and 1 sm. can tomato sauce, (instead of paste)  and 4 bouillon cubes. I also added some paprika. I cooked pasta shells and mixed it in with the stuff in the crock after it was finished cooking on low. (meat mix cooked for 3 hrs on low) I would have used egg noodles, but realized I was out.  This was GREAT!!!!!!!!!  I don't usually like this type of meal, but even I loved it this time. Hubby loves this stuff. I served with grean beans and garlic bread. The mushroom soup made this soooo creamy and yummy. No need for added milk or sour cream.",

Towards the end I thought it needed something else, so I added a can of cream of mushroom... and threw in egg noodles that were cooked 3/4 of the way through.  I let it simmer lightly while I ran to the store for about 20 minutes.  I came back, it was all gone.  My husband had dug into it and thought it was sooooooooo good. He wasn't even all that hungry when he'd came home from work, too.  He told me our 2 year old had two helpings. He left me 2 bites worth.  He thought it was awesome, and I guess my 2 year old did too.  I gave it 4 stars just because I had to tweak it a little bit..  ",

Yes, it is like hamburger helper but with lots less preservatives and trans fats.  I think the recipe writer left out the sour cream part, but anyone who knows stroganoff knows to add sour cream before serving.  We served over egg noodles like another reviewer suggested and it was a good dinner.  Not gourmet, but is stroganoff ever gourmet?  We will make again definitely!  My husband and 21 month-old toddler loved it.  Great for those quick week-night meals.",
