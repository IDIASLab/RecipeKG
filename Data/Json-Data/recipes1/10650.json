I used leftover turkey macaroni rather than egg noodles and frozen mixed veggies that included green beans and corn as well as carrots and peas. I added onion and garlic salt to the soup mixture (as well as a little cardamom and cumin) and poured half of the soup mix on after the veggie layer. I mixed 1 tsp of minced garlic in with the onion layer. After adding the remaining soup mix to the top of the casserole I sprinkled parmesean cheese on the top. It came out pretty well but my boyfriend and I both added more parmesean to our serrvings. Next time I think I'll put a couple layers of shredded monterey jack cheese in and possibly use different veggies (I don't care for the peas in this). Overall though a good way to use up leftover meat without having to say \"turkey/ham/chicken AGAIN?!\"",
