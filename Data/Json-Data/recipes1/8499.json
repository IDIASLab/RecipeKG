I just drop them into small teaspoon size mounds. When my kids were young they made the task of making these much easier--the extra set of hands to put the cinnamon candies on them were a real help! While I make these a bit differently I write this review for those who are experiencing these stiffening up or hardening too fast. A little extra butter will take care of that. To 4 cups of corn flakes I use 1/3 c. butter and 32 marshmallows. For a brilliant green color I use 1 tsp. of green food coloring again for 4 cups of corn flakes. Finally I add 1/2 tsp. each of vanilla and almond extracts for flavor. These have always been a family favorite and are a pretty and colorful addition to a Christmas cookie platter.",

I followed the recipe exactly and put the bowl in a larger bowl with a little hot water to keep the mixture soft. They are very pretty on a cookie tray as they have a bright green color. They do not freeze or last long as they get a little mushy (at least in my house) so I would make these just a few days before Christmas or the event you are taking them to. Thanks for this recipe from my childhood!",
