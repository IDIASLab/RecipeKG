There was one difference; she made her own graham cracker crust and put the dessert in a square pan instead of a pie plate. Then it was cut into squares for serving. This stuff is delicious! It's satisfying and not too heavy. It's always been my favorite dessert. I highly recommend this recipe.",

The flavor of the lemon and pineapple is well balanced, and the recipe couldn't be easier to make. I made my own crust because I wanted to use some ginger snaps as well as grahams. I also used low fat cream cheese and fat free cool whip and it came out wonderfully. If it's summer, I think a few slices of strawberry would go quite well with it.\r\nThis has been an instant classic at my house and I've had several requests to bring it to dinner parties and cookouts. I easily give this recipe 5 stars for it's ease, the flavor, and the texture (wonderfully creamy/fluffy with the graham crunch).",
