Somehow my mom snagged a copy of the cafeteria's recipe which is identical to this one EXCEPT it also calls for a 1/2 cup of sweet crumbs.  For years, I left this out because I wasn't exactly sure what that meant.  I later discovered that it meant finely crushed cookie or graham crackers.  I use graham cracker crumbs (make sure they are really fine!) and it makes this recipe.  It gives the peanut butter layer some substance (without making them dry or crumbly) which makes for much easier cutting.  For those of you who have trouble with the chocolate layer cracking -- let the bars chill until firm, then remove from the frig and let warm up a tad before cutting.  No cracks and smooth cutting.  I also add a couple tablespoons of margarine to the chocolate chips before melting.  ENJOY!",

I added a tbsp of butter to the chocolate as it melted to help keep it soft and easier to cut after cooled.  I also highly suggest using a standing mixer if you have one instead of mixing by hand!  Takes a lot of arm muscles and still may not get the lumps of sugar smoothed out.  I placed parchment paper on bottom of pan and spread the peanuttbutter over, then cooled it and did the chocolate top the mext day.  Then let that cool as well.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and scored the chocolate as it was cooling to allow for easier cutting with out cracking.  This seemed to help.  Also, not cutting when the chocolate is cold will help to keep them from cracking.  Room Temp is fine.  Great recipe, will make again and again.",
