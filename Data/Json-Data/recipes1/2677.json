After you cream the ingredients listed you are supposed to whip the whites of the two eggs used into a merange type consistancy using 1/4 c sugar to help form stiff peaks.  Then you are supposed to add the chocolate mixture to the egg white mixture which will give you plenty of filling for your pie with a taste that is heavenly and is so light and fluffy. The way French silk pie is supposed to be. This is a great recipe that is fast and easy to prepare and is a crowd pleaser every time. ",

I used the paddle first for the butter etc. and then switched to the wisk.  Beating for any length of time on a lower speed won't work. I used 4 Tablespoons of cocoa powder instead of going through the trouble of melting and cooling chocolate.  Also only used 1/2 cup sugar.  I also added 1/4 cup malt powder to the butter mixture before adding the eggs for a French silk malted pie.  Superb!!!!  Double the recipe and the alterations above for a standard premade oreo crust.

This recipe for French Silk Chocolate Pie looked like a winner! I noticed the recommendations to double the filling picked up the ingredients and we began baking. This was my daughter's first experience at rolling pie dough and at holding the mixer for the full five minutes after each egg. Our two trial pies on the weekend turned out delicious! I took one to share with my fellow teachers and froze a piece for my son in college. Then on Tuesday night we began to make the pie for pi day at school. In the middle of the preparations (while waiting for the chocolate to cool) I realized I had only one teaspoon of vanilla not two! What to do? I looked through my cabinets and found almond extract. I thought with the chocolate it probably wouldn't even be tasted. The pie was made and in the refrigerator ready for the final whipped cream topping in the morning. I licked off a little filling from my spatula and just rolled my eyes. That little bit of almond extract was wonderful in that filling! I wished I had made the first two that way! Well the pie was a hit at school; everyone loved it and the pie pan came home empty.",

It was so light, so fluffy and sooooo amazingly simple.  I will never by a pie in a box again.  (Not that I ever did, but if I know someone is about to I'll bring this myself since in my husband's family this is the pie of choice.)  First thing - melt the butter a bit.  It is important that the butter is room temperature, i.e. very soft.  Mine was quite soft and so when I whipped it, it whipped up quickly and easily.  I added the sugar very slowly and you could see the mixture turning white as the recipe said you wanted it to.  If it doesn't turn white you haven't whipped it enough!  Finally, add the eggs one by one.  As each egg was added, it did appear to thicken a bit.  But as the recommended five minutes elapsed it returned to fluffy and then got even fluffier.  Added the next egg and it was the same thing again with an even fluffier result in the end.  Only place I deviated was using a chocolate cookie crumb pie crust.  Added a layer of fresh whipped cream just before serving and we were all absolutely thrilled with this pie!",

I doubled the recipe and still came up short. You would want 2.5 times these amounts to fill a 9 inch pie crust. Also I modified the recipe for sanitary reasons. After adding the raw eggs I slowly brought the batter to a boil over medium heat stirring it regularly. After removing it from the heat I mixed it again at medium speed. This modification gave me peace of mind that I'm not giving anyone food poisoning. The pie set well and had a perfect consistency... in the fridge. After being out for a few minutes it became tasty chocolate soup in a pie shell. I know some of this is the trade-off for cooking the egg whites but I seriously doubt the raw egg pie would last two hours on the buffet table either. This pie needs to be kept cold.",
