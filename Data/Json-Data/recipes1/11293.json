French's Sweet and Tangy Honey Mustard and 2 (heaping) Tbsp. brown sugar...I mixed the 1 Tbsp. Lemon Juice right into the mixture to make it easier to put on the chops. I put the whole thing into my 9x13 baking dish and cooked it at 350 for 30 min. It turned out great! I transfered the chops to a platter and poured the leftover juices into a pan on the stovetop and cooked them for a few minutes to make a yummy sauce to put on top of the chops. If you have a large ovenproof skillet, you could use that instead of your 9x13 and save on cleanup! Overall an easy dish that my 2yr old and very picky 5 year old ate!\r\n",

What I did was mix the brown sugar w/spice brown mustard in the same proportions. Then before putting it on the chops I made a rub of onion powder and garlic powder then added a little corriander and ginger. Mixed that and rubed it on the chops. I drizzled olive oil in the bottom of a 8 x 8 glass baking dish (because I only used 2 butterflied chops) and then put the chops in the dish. I then spread the brown suger/mustard mix on top and let bake for about 40 minutes. They were very good and probably could've only cooked for 30 minutes. Hope this helps.",

This is even better!!I used sliced pork loin (about 1/2\") and did sear it in a skillet first. I mixed the glaze as instructed but used bottled lemon juice instead of fresh. I cooked these longer: about 20 minutes at 325 and then another 20-30 at 350. These were extremely tender and absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!! Even my husband who is not a mustard fan liked them. Next time I may try a couple of minutes under the broiler just before serving.",
