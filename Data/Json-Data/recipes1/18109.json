This is a fabulous recipie. I used parmesan and herb seasoning instead of thyme and colby jack cheese instead of Gruyere because that's what I had on hand and it was scrumptious. Made my crust which I just poked holes with a fork in the crust then simply baked it for 10 min. (blind bake thing too much bother). Fried my bacon and onion, mixed up my eggs, put it all in the fridge and it took 2 minutes to assemble and pop in the oven in the morning! Definitly a keeper!!",

It always gets me giddy when his mouth is filled with something I've just made and he gets that, \"Da*n this is good,\" look on his face.

I substituted onion for spring onion as had a lot of the latter growing in the garden. Then mixed the bacon together with the onion-leek mix which turned out fine. We didn't fill the mixture to the top of the dish as we were afraid it would overflow but now realised we should've as the centre mix will sink a bit as it cools so next time we will make sure to fill it right to the top. We also made the pie dough and for a first timer who wasn't too fussed with specific weights/measurements it turned out fine. I was actually quite surprised how well it turned out and am sure will be making more pie crusts in future instead of going to the supermarket. Highly recommended - I would make this dish again!",
