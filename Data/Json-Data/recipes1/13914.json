My husband, who is use to me baking all sorts of goodies on the weekends, lovessss these (he recently changed his diet due to high cholesterol, so I have been looking for a tasty baked good that is lower in fat).

I gave them a try with some changes...applesauce for 1/2 the butter cutting back on the sugar by half and using spelt flour (whole wheat flour would be a good alternative too). I'm not sure how different they tasted from the original but they were much healthier and they tasted really good. I only gave it 3 stars because I had to make changes to really make them a healthy snack.",

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup added a bit of cinnamon and omitted the salt (i was using dry roasted sunflower seeds which were already plenty salty). I also omitted the hazelnuts (husband doesn't like) and flax seeds (almost 8.00 at my local store for the amount needed!). Tasty cookie. If you don't particularly like the taste of nutmeg I would suggest reducing it by at least 1/2 as these are very nutmeggy cookies. I like the flavor though so thought they were delicious.",

I didn't realize I was out of nutmeg till I was already committed to making these but we didn't miss it at all. These are very versatile - dried fruit would be nice particularly apples I think.
