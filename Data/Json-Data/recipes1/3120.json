As a time saver I used a bag of ready-to-eat chopped Romaine lettuce. I subtituted 1/2 cup sliced green onions instead of a regular one (for milder taste - just a personal preference) 1 chopped red bell pepper instead of peas (to give it color) no cheese (to lower the fat) and 3/4 cups reduced fat Ranch dressing insead of mayonnaise. Layered with lettuce cauliflower red bell pepper green onions turkey bacon and dressing. It's key to let this sit overnight so that the flavors meld. Thanks for the recipe!",
