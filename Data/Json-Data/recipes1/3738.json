I am not a fan of the usual pasta and potato salads at BBQ's. They are way too heavy for me. I love the lightness of this pasta salad. I love being able to use my veggies that grow in abundance in my garden along with my fresh dill although I frequently use 1 T dry dill which adds up to be more than what the recipe calls for. We also sometimes substitute the sour cream for greek yogurt (fage) or go halfsies. We also use 1/4 cup whole milk instead of the skim milk it calls for. We tried cutting back on the salt but this recipe really needs it along with plain shaker style black pepper. We tried using whole wheat pasta but it doesn't work well with this recipe. We enjoy the spiral type pasta or regular elbows. This pasta salad is the perfect answer for those looking for a lighter variation of the normal macaroni salad.",
