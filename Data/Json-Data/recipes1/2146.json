My family almost ate the entire pan-full! I added a can of pre-sliced potatoes(chopped) 1/4 c. onion(chopped) 1 1/2 Tablespoons chicken seasoning & 1/8 t. rubbed sage. I also used a can of cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of mushroom soup. I like my filling very creamy so the next time I make it I will add either 1/2 or a whole can of cream of chicken and/or mushroom soup and reduce the amount of chicken broth. This is a permanent addition to my recipe archives!",

On top of those I added sauteed celery boiled diced potatoes and canned corn (any vegetables i could get my hands on basically). Instead of cream of mushroom soup which i'm not a fan of I made a gravy out of chicken stock butter and flour (which i'll venture was healthier than canned cream soup). all in all though I stuck with the basic feel of the recipe with great results. I really loved the top crust the biscuit mix was fluffy and delicious-i love the addition of celery seed!",
