I didn't have celery, so I put in corn.  I really recommend that!  Next time, I'll put in corn, celery, carrots, green beans, broccoli or cauliflower, and garbanzo beans.  Also, I made my own meatballs (just made up my own recipe with ground beef, shredded cheddar, egg, milk, fresh bread crumbs, salt, pepper, lots of garlic powder and oregano) and that took hardly any work and it's just nicer when you make them yourself!  I also added a couple teaspoons of Italian seasoning in place of the herbs mentioned, no salt... It was great!  Next time I'll also red some crushed red pepper flakes.  I used shells instead of macaroni and increased it to one and a half cups.",

It got a resounding thumbs up from frozen hubby as well as two thumbs up from my 5 year old son and 7 year old daughter.  I had to make a few substitutions due to what was in the house.  Luckily I had about 25 frozen meatballs from the last time I cooked and had left-overs.  No celery and only a small amound of carrots, so in went a can of corn.  We were a little low on spices, so in went an envelope of Lipton Savory Herb with Garlic.  I used some spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce, and at the end just added some already cooked noodles to the soup.  It was just wonderful, and I'll be making this soup time and time again.

The broth was a little thin and a little bland, I think the next time I will add some tomato paste to thicken it up.  I also thought the taste of the oregano and the thyme was a little overpowering.  The next time, I will leave out the thyme altogether and reduce the amount of oregano, but add some more garlic.  Good, just needs some tweaking.  I agree with someone that said not to use more than the recommended amount of macaroni, overnight it did soak up a lot of the broth.  **UPDATE** I made it again, adding a small can of tomato paste, another bouillon cube and a total of 3 garlic cloves...I left out the thyme, only used 1/4 tsp of oregano and left everything else the same.  It was fantastic!  I think the next time, I will cook it for about 35 mins before I add the pasta...the veggies were a little crunchy still...now it's a 5 star!",

I just boiled water in my kettle and poured it into the slow cooker. I didn't have any oregano so I used Italian seasoning. I also didn't have any bouillon cubes so I didn't use them. Of course the soup needed salt to replace to beef flavour. I would use more garlic too. (I love garlic!) I used 2 cloves but I'd probably use 4 or 5 next time. If I were to make it again I would probably add more tomato and less water. I like a little thicker soup. And I also used corn in place of celery and carrots however I think all of the above and a few more would be good too. But overall good soup. I like the fact that I could modify to work in the slow cooker!",
