I like the moistness of shortening but I also I like the flavor and richness of butter - so I used a 50/50 combination of both. I also added 1/2 tsp. of salt to enhance flavor. I baked this as cupcakes and found them light moist and delicately sweet. As long as you cream your shortening or butter and sugar well and then add the eggs one at a time to keep the batter aerated and emulsified you won't have any \"dry and dense\" issues. I would not hesitate to make this again...repeatedly. With lots of fluffy buttercream frosting.",

My real problems came when getting the cakes out of the pan. I had greased and floured the pans using techniques that are tried and true but neither cakes would come out. I let the cakes cool completely and when I tried to get the cakes out they both crumbled. The cake was very dry and would not stay in its cake form. The taste was also very bland and not moist at all like a cake should be. I would not recommend this recipe.",
