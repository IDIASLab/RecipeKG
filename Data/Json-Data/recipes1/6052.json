My mother and I were going through a book of homemade recipes hand-written by my grandmother. My mother said she remembered the prune cake and how much her brother and sister enjoyed that cake as small children. She asked me to make the cake for her one day just to see how it would turn out. Problem was, the page that the recipe was written on was so old that we couldn't make out some of the recipe directions. I used this recipe instead because the ingredients were extremely similiar to my grandmother's recipe. My mother LOVED the cake and my gandmother said it tasted just like hers when she used to make it. Thank you very much for the recipe--it truly is an \"old-fashioned\" cake recipe! I wanted to comment also...in the past I would have turned my nose up to anything prune...especially a cake. But everyone should give this cake a try. I can guarantee you'll love it.",

I also did not use the glaze as I already found the cake to be sweet enough. Instead of baking in a bundt pan I used either one 9X13 pan or two2 9 inch round pans. I have also tried using chopped crystalized bael fruit (commonly eaten in Thailand and can be found in Asian food store) to replace the prunes and complimenting it with toasted almond sticks. It was a major hit! This bael cake will not go with the spices though as the bael fruit has its own distinct aroma.",

I used a 16oz. jar of Sunsweet stewed prunes, which yielded about 1 1/4 cups of pureed prunes, and the cake was very moist.  I made this years ago using dried prunes, and it wasn't nearly as moist as with stewed.  When my teenaged son heard it was made with prunes, he initially refused to try it.  When he heard my husband comment how delicious it was, he tried it and loved it!  Advertise it as a Spice Cake and no one will ever know!",

I admit that it seems a little unfair to give something called \"prune cake\" a low rating because it tasted like prunes but I got taken in by those Sunsweet ads about the individually wrapped prunes tasting like candy -- they don't -- and I was hoping to use them up in some fashion where I wouldn't have to taste them. Oh well. If you like prunes or even raisins try this. You'll probably like it. (By the way: heat the glaze over low heat and stop once the butter is melted and the sugar dissolved. Don't let it boil and you won't have any problems with curdling.)",
