I used the whole box.  I was prepared to leave a scathing review, but realized I messed it up.  I will try this recipe again and leave a new review.  BE AWARE OF THE CAKE MIX AMOUNTS!

Had a box of \"Jiffy\" brand yellow mix in the cupboard intending to make a cinnamon roll recipe so that worked perfectly since it is 9 oz exactly.  No where in the recipe did it say to knead the dough.  I did knead the dough until it had the sheen.  This is a sticky dough but I just kept flouring my board.  I let it rise in a warmed oven for 1 hour and rose nicely double in bulk.  The dough will appear too sticky to be able to roll into anything but I just floured my board and rolling pin and this dough was actually beautiful to work with. Used the pizza cutter to slice into sections and it did not stick to the board at all. Cut each round into 12 sections and used real butter instead of margarine.  They are a sweeter roll but not sickening.  They baked up like a picture.  did some poppy seed, sesame seed, and left some plain.  buttery good.  Really no need to use butter.  The only thing I would suggest is a bit of salt added to the second cup of flour when making the dough.  Salt added directly to yeast mixture can kill the yeast.  Thanks for this nice recipe with a surprisingly lovely dough to work with.",

My only issue was that I had to add more flour than called for (maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup extra). the dough was so fluffy and a real joy to work with. I cut each circle into 12 wedges so I got 24 rolls out of this recipe. I didn't brush them w/ anything before baking but as soon as they came out of the oven I brushed 1/2 of them w/ melted butter and sprinkled some w/ poppy seeds. The other 1/2 I allowed to cool and froze them for another time. I couldn't wait until dinner to try these so I did....they are light fluffy and delicious w/ great flavor...not too sweet just right! To those that had issue it seems to be that the size cake mix was off...I used a 9oz. box of Jiffy yellow cake mix...PERFECT! These will def be made again and again...they couldn't be simplier YUM!
