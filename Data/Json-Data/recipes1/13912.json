                "reviewBody": "I bought my boyfriend the Waring Pro Belgian Waffle Maker for Christmas, but he didn't have a good waffle recipe.  I was in search of the \"perfect\" waffle recipe to replicate the flavor and crispness of hotel-style waffles because he would like to be able to wake up in the morning and pour pre-made batter onto the waffle iron and have a wonderful breakfast in a matter of minutes.  I was beginning to get discouraged after trying some other \"highly rated\" recipes and coming up short--they were either not crispy enough, too crispy, lacking substance, too doughy inside, too oily tasting, or too much like french toast.  Although the general ingredients in this recipe aren't too different from others, there's something about it that is spot on!  I made a couple of minor changes based upon what I've learned through other trial & error: I added 1/4 cup corn starch for crispness, used 1 3/4 cups milk and 1/2 cup buttermilk to add a little flavor.  I beat 2 Tbsp of the sugar in with the egg yolks (actually used Egg Beaters substitute) and 3 Tbsp of the sugar in with the egg whites, which stabilizes and softens the whites, improving the batter's longevity and making it much easier to fold into the batter.  I used 2 tsp vanilla and mixed 1 tsp with the yolks and 1 tsp with the whites after they were whipped.  I found I got the most uniform brown color when I used very little cooking spray.  These were fantastic!  They even smelled wonderful!  I may try adding malted milk powder next time",

Also, I substitute in some corn starch into the flour mixture and this adds a nice crunch to the waffle.  Another thing I have learned is if you want to keep waffles warm to place them on the oven rack directly, don't ever stack them or put them on a plate, else they can get soggy.",

The only thing that could have been better was the spillage - it is hard to tell how full to make the waffle iron since they rise quite a bit. Don't overfill! Irons are not easy to clean if the batter overflows. I used a new Krups iron that makes 4 square Belgian waffles and the batter made about 9 of these. Add an eighth tsp cinnamon and serve with sweetened vanilla whipped cream...enjoy!",

That may have something to do with the fact that my handmixer is not working and I had to do it all by hand, but there were lots of steps just to make waffles.  \n\nNone the less, this recipe is fantastic!  The outside of the waffle is crispy and the inside is soft and delicious.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, with a couple changes.  First, I added a few tablespoons of malted milk at my husband's request.  Also, I only used half the salt that was called for.  Next time I will either skip the salt altogether or use unsalted butter, as it was still a little bit salty for my taste.\n\nMy husband raved about these waffles, I will most definitely be making them again!",
