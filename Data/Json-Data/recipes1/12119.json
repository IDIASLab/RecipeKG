I did add some vanilla and I used mandarin oranges for the fruit (that's what I had on hand).  I just used an individual one-cup size of the oranges.  I drained the juice into measuring cup and then added milk to make the 1 cup of liquid.  My husband really liked his vanilla muffin (he got the one the last one scraped from the bowl and didn't get any mandarin oranges).  I definitely liked the added vanilla with the mandarin oranges but probably would add cinnamon instead if I made apple muffins.",
