The bread is moist and tender not hard and with using the bread maker this is a pretty easy recipe to make. It takes time due to the required rising but other than that it's quick and easy. I did do a couple of things differently -- I added more cinnamon 1 tsp was not nearly enough; I omitted the powdered milk; and I used cream instead of ice cream. Next time I'll add nuts and they'll be perfect. I'm glad I didn't heed the advice to double the caramel they were quite sweet and quite gooey with the recipe as it was. Try 'em you won't be disappointed.",

I make them for our clinic about 2x monthly and they're gone by 9AM. I'm careful not to add much or any extra flour and work with the extra-soft dough as it keeps them \"melt-in-your-mouth\" textured. I mix mine in my Kitchen Aid while making the caramel sauce (which I only cook for about 1 minute or less so it's not so stiff after baking. We like them oozing the caramel. After cooking the sauce for 2 minutes we found it to be too caramelzed after baking and we had trouble getting it unstuck from our teeth. I never make less than a double batch.

That way the gooey caramel oozes into all the cracks of the buns. I also put a cream cheese frosting over the whole shebang (the one from the clone of a cinnabon recipe).
