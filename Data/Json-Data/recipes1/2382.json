                "reviewBody": "OMG - how awesome to find this recipe here! My Grandma used to make this 45 years ago, and it's always been my favorite. It was either from a magazine or a Baker's recipe pamphlet that she'd had at least since the 1930's or 1940's. I've made this so many times over the years and I can guarantee that it's fabulous! It's really decadent without being overly sweet. The sweetness comes from the meringue shell, which plays perfectly against the rich chocolate filling, when made as written. If you substitute Cool Whip it will be a much sweeter pie and have a much different texture as the whipped cream is what dictates the firmness of the filling. Whip the cream until very stiff and the consistency will be that of a sturdy mousse. This is a wonderful pie exactly as written, and is delicious without embellishments. The ONLY other suggestion I would make is to try using a non-stick pie pan, as I've had touble in the past with the meringue sticking to the pie dish (could just be our darned St. Louis humidity!); I thought about greasing and flouring the dish, as one does for cakes, but wasn't sure if that would work with the meringue or not. All in all though, excellent recipe. Thanks so much, Marcia, for submitting this, so I'll never have to worry about losing it again!",

                "reviewBody": "My family used to make this pie every year for Passover because it's borderline Kosher.;) We got it from an early edition of the New York Times cook book- I think from the mid-1960's. The NYT book recommends unsweetened chocolate for the filling which I prefer; it gives a more smooth complex flavor to offset the sweetness of the other ingredients. Also for some reason it recommends using room-temperature eggs for best results. Dunno why but I don't mess with success! Make sure you beat the meringue until it's in VERY stiff peaks- otherwise it'll settle to the bottom of the pie tin and it may cook unevenly. Pile it up around the edges so you have a real crust not just a flat thing. The filling is easy you just have to make sure you don't burn the chocolate- leave the burner on low and stir frequently until it's all melted. I also like to add a bit of vanilla to the whipped cream. You can let this sit in the refrigerator as long as you like; just cover it so it doesn't dry out. Also keep it chilled until you serve it because the filling melts! It's still tasty but it's more like pudding that way. I'm baking this for a pie-themed party tomorrow and am anticipating much ooh-ing and ahh-ing!",
