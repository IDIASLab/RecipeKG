You will be surprised by your results!  I make the starter in the bowl of my KitchenAid mixer, and let it sit, as stated.  Then, using my dough hook attachment, I add the flour and beer and knead for about 3 minutes - until it pulls away from the bowl and looks nice and shiny.  Then I let it rise, and after 2 hours or so, punch it down and shape it in my final baking container for the last rise.  I use a clay baker with a lid (mason cash cooker), and have found that when I use that, there is no need to put the bowl of water in the oven when I bake it.  The clay baker captures the steam and keeps it moist on the inside. I take the lid off for the final 5 minutes to get a super crispy top.  I love this recipe!",

The flavor is good, but not as developed as Chef John's pumpkin bread which rises over-night. The crust has a crunch to it and the interior is nice and soft though. I am not sure why, but it makes really good grilled cheeses. Either way, for the beer, in the bread, I used an imported Pilsner style beer, which is a lighter flavored beer. I didn't want the bread to taste like beer and it didn't at all. The bread goes into the oven a little flat, but it does get a nice spring in the oven.",

Crispy crust, soft interior, moist, chewy, & springy.  The flavor of the crust is rustic.  Tastes exactly like bread you would purchase from a fresh bread store.\nI placed the yeast, 1/2 cup of flour and water in the bread machine and let rest for a half an hour.  Then added the beer, rest of the flour and salt.  Started the bread machine on the dough cycle until dough formed a nice looking ball (had to add a little more flour).  Placed well mixed ball of dough into a lightly greased bowl and let rise for 2 hours or until doubled.  Took dough out and placed on well floured surface and sprinkled flour on top.  Formed into loaf (very easy dough to work with) then placed on baking sheet with cornmeal on bottom.  Let rise for 40 minutes.  Pre heated oven with baking stone on the top and a pan of water on the bottom rack.  After 40 minutes, make a split in the loaf and place into oven for the 35 minutes.  PERFECT!!",

I chose Blue Moon belgian white ale because its a beer my husband and I like though we rarely drink so I wanted to be picky.  Beautiful, very large artisan loaf with fluffy center and chewy outside.  TIPS: Turn oven on lowest temp and then open the oven door a crack allowing it to cool.  Place a hot wet but wrung out towel on top and place in your warm oven and let sit for 30 minutes.  This will jump start a heavily loaf of springy bread.  Do the same thing for the second rise for 2 hours.  For the last rising on the pan before you bake it, turn on your oven and sit the cookie sheet on top of your oven covered loosely with a dish towel.  This will give you the best results as the heat from the oven will warm the bottom of the pan and warm your dough giving you the best end result.",

                "reviewBody": "This review is for people who had trouble with this recipe.  The original approach is sound, but my alternatives may help those who struggled.\n\n1. Ingredients: bread flour instead of AP flour. \"Bread machine\" yeast instead of active dry yeast; it is much more reliable.  I had 1-3/4C beer left over from last night (go figure) and added 1/2C water to that.  The extra 1/4C liquid makes a big difference. \n\n2. I didn't bother with the premix.  I just put everything in the bowl of a stand mixer and kneaded for 10 minutes.  Yes, this is no longer \"no knead\" bread, but since I have a mixer that will do the job I always knead. Plus, it's essential for developing the gluten structure this loaf needs, imho. \n\n3. Let rise for four hours, not two.  Because the beer is cold or at room temperature, it will   the rise. \n\n3. I no longer slit my loaves before baking.  Helps maintain structure and makes for a more rustic look.\n\n4. I no longer use cornmeal.  Parchment paper works better and is far less messy.  \n\n5.  I made one large loaf.  But this recipe should also work for two smaller loaves that would be more manageable.  You could divide the dough and bake in loaf pans also, topping each with melted butter.",
