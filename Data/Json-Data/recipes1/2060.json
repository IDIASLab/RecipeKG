I followed it exactly even though I was skeptical about leaving out a mixture of dough containing eggs out overnight but I was determined to have these come out perfectly. Boy were these ever good and so easy too! The dough was easy to roll out (used wax paper lightly floured) and I cut it with a pizza cutter to get nice little triangles. I baked these on parchment paper and they came out nice and fluffy with a slight sweetness. My husband and niece just loved them and quite frankly I did too! Plus the leftovers are great for breakfast with butter and jelly....",

Cut the dough in half and roll each half into a 12\"X9\" rectangle sprinkle the dough liberally with cinnamon sugar and pecans and raisins if desired Drizzle with 3 tablespoons of melted butter. Roll up as for a jelly roll and cut into 1\" pieces using thread works well for this. Place on a lightly oiled cookie sheet cover and set on the counter overnight to rise. Whoever gets up to make the coffee pops them into the oven! Bake as directed in the original recipe. Oh it's so good!",
