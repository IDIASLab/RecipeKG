I omitted the bamboo shoots. I used stir fry sauce instead of teriyaki sauce. This recipe was awesome!! The amount of sauce was perfect for the veggies / meat and the bison was absolutely delicious in this recipe. Tender great texture and wonderful flavor. I am looking forward to making this again soon!! I did add a little salt and pepper to the meat while it was cooking as well - not sure if it really affected the flavor or not.",
