The garlic and onion combo added just the right touch of spicy flavor. To the onion mixture I added a diced up hot pepper and more garlic to give it some extra flavor. We had cubed lamb handy so we diced that up in small pieces and it worked just fine. Instead of using plain feta cheese I used a tomato basil feta cheese. I would think that even the garlic and herb feta cheese would also be good depending on your preference. I added almost double the tomato sauce and it still was not enough for our taste. I will be adding more next time. All in all it was a good recipe and I will be making it in the future. Thanks for the recipe.",

I also used tomato soup instead of tomato sauce. There is already sugar in the soup so I just added the lemon juice. Then baked for 30 minutes with foil cover and 15 min uncovered. The were wonderful!! Thank you! btw I used yellow orange and green peppers...they worked great! I've also made this with eggplants instead of peppers...it's excellent as well.

I then added the garlic pepper and dill (I only had dried dill). I had a bottle of Ragu that needed using so I added that. It was pretty sweet already so I omitted the sugar and threw in a good slug of bottled lemon juice. When the sauce had simmered for about 45 mins I added the cooked rice and feta (I knew the feta would be salty so I omitted salt also). Finally I sliced the lids off the peppers boiled the peppers for about 10 mins. Then I stuffed them and topped them with a little more feta. Baked them for about 25 mins. Perfect! Great recipe.
