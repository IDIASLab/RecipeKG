I used 5 cloves of garlic, 8 cups of chicken broth (instead of water), and 3/4 cup red wine, and the whole bag of baby spinach. I didn't add the kidney beans until the last 10 minutes so they wouldn't fall apart. I cooked the pasta separately and then added it. I used more then a half a cup because I like to see the pasta in my soup. It was a very thick soup even with the addition of all that chicken broth. I cooked it for about 1 hour give or take a little bit. I did think that addition of the parmesan cheese gave the soup great taste. I highly recommend this soup. All the great reviews are right, this soup is great.",

I substituted a squash for one of the zucchini.  I also added 1 cup shredded cabbage and 3 red potatoes.  Instead of the seashell pasta I choice Ditalini because I prefer a smaller pasta.  I did not have fresh basil or oregano on hand so I used Italian seasoning.  I cooked it for 2 hours adding the potatoes and pasta in the last 20 minutes.

I've never been able to resist meddling, so I also cut down the amount of celery, used yellow squash and zucchini both, white beans instead of kidney beans, and ditalini pasta instead of shells.  Fresh basil and rosemary added wonderful flavor, this is the perfect vegetable soup.  I also added a few drops of lemon juice while it simmered, to freshen the flavors a little.  Thank you Jamie!",

                "reviewBody": "If using tomato sauce it is more a tomato soup with vegetables than minestrone soup.  I replaced a 1/2 cup of the tomato sauce with water and used fresh green beans, adding another 1/2 cup water because the canned beans were undrained.  Three zucchini was a lot to add, switching to 1 zucchini and other family favorite vegetables recommended (corn adds color variation).  If the broth is too acidic or tangy after 10 minutes of simmering add an 1/8 tsp. baking soda to cut it.",
