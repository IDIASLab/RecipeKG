This pie was fantastic. I have made it 5 times or so over the summer and receive compliments every time. It has just the right amount of sweetness and just the right amount of tartness. The first time I made it I used some extra filling to dip some strawberries in which was very yummy. This gave me the idea to incorporate strawberries in some way. The next time I prepared it then I added 2 tablespoons of All Fruit strawberry preserves. Everyone raved about it and when I made it next I sliced strawberries and laid them on the bottom of the crust before I poured in the strawberry-lemon filling -- SOOO good!!!",

I agree with previous reviewers who say to use a shortbread crumb crust... it is awesome with this pie whereas graham cracker crust I think would just taste wrong. I don't see why people complain about the gelatin.... okay so the texture may not be authentically \"mousse\" like but the gelatin holds the pie together and it's not like the texture is bad. I would rather have my pie hold together and be easy to slice which is what the gelatin does for this pie. I am making this for Thanksgiving this year as my 8 year old begged for it. Thanks for a new family favorite!",
