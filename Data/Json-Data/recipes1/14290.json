The only changes I made was substituting the cracker crumbs for Parmesan flavored bread crumbs since that's what I had on hand and topping each mushroom with a torn slice of mozzarella cheese the last few seconds of baking then hiking the temp up to broil to get some cheese bubbling action going. Just my little tip with stuffed mushrooms: I always saute the whole mushroom caps on both sides for a few minutes then drain hollowed side down on paper towels for at least 10 minutes prior to stuffing. This softens the mushrooms a little for a more tender texture and draws some of the natural water out of them so you can avoid a soggy wet mushroom. Also reduces baking time for the finished product and they always turn out perfectly tender and sog-free!:-) Thanks so much for the recipe...can't wait to serve these at the Superbowl party. I might even try a little marinara sauce on the side for dipping!",

Sprinkled more parm on top with a dot of evoo and a bit of paprika. These were sensational Shar and I thank you so much for the sneak preview!!",

I would suggest making 3 per person. I bought the larger mushrooms from Costco vs the smaller ones from the grocery store...this made all the difference and were a better price too! Be sure to get fresh pepperoni from the deli...I used Boar's Head...they sliced it in pieces about a 1/4 inch thick so that I could dice it easily. I used two garlic cloves instead of one (used jarred minced). I used garlic herb crackers (TownHouse Toppers) to add some flavor vs just using plain butter crackers. I added extra parm (used a 1/4 cup total) and instead of grating it I used the shredded bagged and put in the mini-chopper. I used chicken broth and thought it tasted great...will maybe try white wine (as others have done) next time to compare. I sprinkled paprika over them before baking to add a little flavor. About half way through baking I sprinkled on some shredded parm...this added a nice flavor to the top. One thing that is very important as others have mentioned is to saute AND drain the mushrooms before stuffing them. I did saute them but forgot to drain them afterwards...all was okay but the bottom of the pyrex dish was quite liquidy after I baked them...was no biggy but I would have liked for them to have been less soggy. Fantastic!!!",
