Corona does not work well.  This is what I used this time and it really had no flavor.  Hard cider is my favorite, it gives your bread a slight fruity taste.",

I tasted the Tastefully Simple recipe for the first time yesterday which was just plain, but very good, and so delighted when I found the recipe here.  I am fond of cheese and had several varieties at home already so I used a cup of a combination of grated fresh mozzarella, asiago, and parmesan. I added chopped green olives and pimentos and used Kirin beer.  It turned out so tasty it did not really need dip even, which is what I was making it for.  TS onion onion) I used the recommended size loaf pan and had butter overflow (I only used 3T)so do use a cookie sheet underneath to keep it from sizzling on the bottom of your oven.  The hard crispy top was so good, I will use a reviewer's tip next time to bake in a 13x9 pan to get more crunchy topping!  I am sure this would be great with other variations.  Thanks for the recipe!!!",

I have to admit that I was worried about the bread turning out badly because it seemed to be floating in butter but as it was baking, it soaked up the butter and made this wonderful crust. It's VERY good. Not something I'd make every day but a wonderful occasional decadent treat.",

I used Miller Lite beer extra sharp Cheddar cheese and reduced the grease fix on the top to 2 Tbs. of unsalted butter and 2 Tbs. \"ICBINB\". Next time I would add more chile pepper as they got lost. My only problem was that I only had an 8-1/2 by 4-1/2 inch glass loaf dish and the fat fix on top of the bread rolled off onto the oven floor. Next time I would decrease the amount of batter by about 25% so that that won't happen again!!! YUMMY.",

I decreased the melted butter to about 3 tablespoons and stirred in about 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder before pouring over the bread (it did not come out greasy at all). This sort of reminded me of a biscuit but it was much more moist. It baked up beautiful and sliced great too! Once fall/winter comes I will definately be serving this bread with a nice big hearty bowl of chili! Thanks for posting.:)",
