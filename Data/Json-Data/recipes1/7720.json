                "reviewBody": "Yum, this recipe turned out wonderfully with some slight changes! I made this recipe the traditional way w/out a bread machine by proofing yeast w/ 1 tbs honey and warm water for about 10mins. Then added the rest of the ingredients (I cup of flour at a time until elastic),  kneaded the dough for about 6-8 mins and let it rise until doubled.\n\nChanges: \n\u2022\tI made these into 12 large sweet rolls instead of breadsticks. Since the dough is pretty sweet I didn\u2019t add any additional sugar, I just left out the seeds.  If you are making breadsticks I'd decrease the sugar to 2-3 tbs. and you might want to try adding some garlic, oregano, and onion powder to the dough to make it really tasty. \n\u2022\tThe trick to getting a crunchy exterior is by spraying the dough with oil before baking. You will get a better texture if you use bread four instead of all-purpose (although, all-purpose still works well).  If you are still getting a tough breadstick try decreasing the sugar (sugar competes with the yeast for liquid), and/or increase the butter to 4 tbs). \nWonderful recipe besides those small changes!!! \n",

I wanted something extra special and different for a bread.  After finding this one, I decided to try it.  Ite was easy and wonderful!  However, instead of rolling the dough into 18 separate balls and then rolling them out individually, I rolled the dough into a rectangle, and took a pizza cutter, cutting the dough into strips.  It worked perfectly, and was time saving.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!",

I do not own a breadmaker but am experienced in bread baking, no problems. My first alteration was because of ingredient constraints - no powered milk. I have never used it. Subbed 2/3 cp milk and 2/3 water.  Omitted the sesame seeds as I wanted them to be Italian bread sticks. So I added 1 tsp Italian dried spices and 1 tsp garlic powder to the proofed yeast mixture along with the salt. I did try the water-spraying trick another cook mention but I didn't find that the sticks were particularly more crunchy on the outside. Ten mins into baking time, I basted them with a melted butter, garlic powder and parmesan cheese combo and continued baking another 10 mins.  I weighed the dough to 2 oz a piece to insure uniformed size sticks and even baking. Perfection! Thanks Paula and thanks for listening!",
