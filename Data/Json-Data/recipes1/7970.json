I read a few reviews and made my version (this rendition at least) by adding diced tomatoes shredded red cabbage pre-cooked pasta (left over linguini cut to 1 to 2 inch lengths) chopped hot peppers and replaced vegetable broth for water. Next time I am going to use frozen cut okra and rice. After that maybe I'll add canned black beans (drained and rinsed) and extra cayenne for a south-of-the-border version.",
