My husband says it's the best fish he's ever eaten and he's a staunch \"keep it simple\" New Englander. The dish is like having dinner and dessert on one plate. I used real butter VS. margarine so added some olive oil to raise the frying temp for the fish without burning the butter. The crust came out a bit blackened for me but it was not \"burnt\" but \"caramelized\". Hubby gave this five stars so do I!",

First I would saute onions with the apples for the topping. Second I would substitute something else for the bread crumbs -- maybe crushed buttery crackers -- because I didn't care for the bread crumb flavor. (If using bread crumbs; two cups is excessive; 1 cup would be adequate). Oh and make sure somebody else has clean up duty because this recipe uses a lot of dishes!",

This recipe should stipulate that fillets must be very thin for them to cook through before the butter starts to burn. Fillets must be approximately 1/2 inch. Otherwise what you can do it simply pan-sear the fillets and when they are fried put them in the oven at 350 degrees for 15-20 minutes.",

It was wonderful and very easy. Only addittions were a smidge of red pepper flakes to the bread crumbs for an bit of zip and a teaspoon or so of lemon juice to the apples while frying. As another user suggested I would add ground nuts - almonds pistachios walnuts - whatever to crumb crust if I have them on hand. To the user who complained about dishes - use wax paper for flour/crumb step. While my boyfriend raves about everything I prepare he is still talking about this one. Will definately make again - soon. Thanks",
