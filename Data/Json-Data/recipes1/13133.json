I made them exactly as the recipe indicated and they simply tasted like fried bread crumbs.I'd printed the recipe out months ago so I didn't have the numerous changes from the reviews to factor in, but I was certain they'd be tasty after reading the description on the recipe itself. The first problem I ran into was the recipe calls for heavy cream...but nowhere in the instructions does it say to WHIP it. Instead the instructions begin by saying to mix the whipped cream with the eggs. THERE'S A CRUCIAL STEP LEFT OUT IN THIS RECIPE. Additionally, these are extremely bland. Some spices desperately need to be added to the crumb mixture. After reading the reviews today, I see that there are a number of things others have done to produce a more tasty zucchini stick. But after doing that...I feel that I now have a different recipe and not this one. I L-O-V-E fried zucchini, but was sorely disappointed in these and will not be making them again.",
