Use 2 cups of Apples and 1 cup bread crums. (Recipe wanted 3 cups bread crumbs).  2.) DO NOT cook for 1 hour or it will get too dry.  Cook for 20 minutes with foil on and 20 with foil off.   With those 2 changes this is a GREAT recipe.",

I used more of the stuffing ingredients and added about 2 cups of apple juice and about 2 tsps. of poultry seasoning and garlic salt.  After stuffing the chops, I wrapped them with a piece of bacon before pan frying.  I put all the left over stuffing in the bottom of the pan and put the chops on top and cooked as instructed.
