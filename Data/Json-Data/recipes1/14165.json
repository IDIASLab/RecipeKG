First off I added a few leaves of fresh basil torn up. Next I also added three sliced green onions. I also added a dash of salt. Although I didn't want to deviate from the original recipe to much a few minor additions were what gave this already tasty recipe a personal touch. Thanks to the contributor for this new favorite!",
