My only concern with this meal was that it was kind of watery in the dish while cooking. My salsa was really chunky so I think that it was the fact that I did not pat the filets dry enough before putting them in the oven. Also, I get antsy about fish being cooked completely & by putting all of the ingredients on top of it immediately, it was hard for me to tell. Next time, I will cook the fish for 10 minutes just to be sure & then add the salsa, cheese & tortilla chips. Great recipe! Thanks for posting it.",
