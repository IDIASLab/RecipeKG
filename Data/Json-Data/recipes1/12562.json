I made this pie today and it is the BEST pie that we ever ate. I did not cook the berries first and it gave the pie a very slightly berry crunch which made it extra flavorful. All I can say is that I wish we had more saskatoon berries in our freezer for more pies. Truly a wonderful and delightful pie.",
