I usually use the recipe on the vanilla wafer box, but, I didn't have the wafers, yet, so...\nI doubled the recipe (because I like extra...I'll share that in a minute).  I added about 1/2 tsp salt.  I cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup (1.5 cup for double recipe).  Cooked on med.hi. heat in a double boiler until it thickened, (be patient and make sure to cook at high enough heat, but not too high).\nWhen done, I poured 1/2 of pudding into a bowl and added the vanilla (2 tsp) and chill before making the banana pudding, hot pudding has always made my wafers mushy.  The other half of the pudding stayed in the double boiler on low heat and got a good dollop of semi-sweet chocolate chips, they melt quickly and VOILA!  Delicious chocolate pudding!!  Since this is a sweet pudding, even with the sugar cut back, bittersweet chocolate chips (or cocoa powder) would be good.  I'll put this one in my recipe file, hopefully my family will carry on the YUMMM.  ;-)",

Layer my pan with vanilla waffer add the banana in then the  pudding.And i continue that untill it reach the top, i didn't do a meringue topping i just  place crushed vanilla waffer on top.This was my first attempt at making an homeade banana pudding becasuse i always opted for the easy instant jello way out.But i'm through with instant pudding mix this will be my one and only banana pudding recipe.Thanks a million for such a delish pudding.Yummy Yummy\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I did reduce the sugar like some of the others (which I am glad I did) But in the meringue I followed someones suggestion of 2/3 instead of a 1/2 cup (I believe) DON'T DO THIS! KEEP IT THE ORGINAL AMOUNT OF SUGAR OR A LITTLE LESS. It turned out way to sweet! But I did add Vanilla and cream of tartar (which I don't think was a bad idea). If I had of just added those 2 things and did not add more sugar to meringue the recipe would of been great. Next time I will know better:)",
