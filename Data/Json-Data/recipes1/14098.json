For our tastes, I double all the spices in the batter-- make the trip to the indian market, it's worth it.  I use whatever veg I have on hand (try carrots, spinach, broccoli, mushrooms), dice them small, and add the whole lot to the batter and stir.  Then drop by tablespoons into the hot oil.  Don't worry, they will form together into patties when they cook (or if they fall apart a little, they're so tasty no one will mind!), cook until they seem just a little overdone to make them good and crispy. They're not bad the second day, if they last, just a bit soggy. Reheat in the oven.",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe was quite tasty and authentic. I've made it twice now with only a few minor adjustments: 1 tsp chili powder for a bit more spice, 1 tsp garlic powder instead of cloves, and a handful of freshly chopped coriander. If you like it really spicy, you can also add a green chili or two. For the first round, I used slightly less cauliflower and added 1 large potato (cubed) to the mix. For the second round, I used potato & brocoli. Both variations tasted great! I mixed everything together in the batter and then dropped spoonfuls of mixture into the oil. (Note: Pakora is usually a small cluster of fried veggies, but if they don't stick together, don't worry. It doesn't affect the taste at all!) My cook time was about 10-15 minutes per batch, but I don't use a deep-fryer, so perhaps the deep-fryer is a bit quicker. For a more traditional dipping sauce, try a mint chutney, but if you prefer to keep it simple, ranch dressing & ketchup work great too! These tasty little treats WILL disappear quickly, so doubling the recipe is a good idea! I made a single batch this evening, and hubby & I polished off the entire plate! Makes a great appetizer or snack food, and once you get the hang of it, you can whip this up in no time at all!",
