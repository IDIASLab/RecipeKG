The appearance is beautiful with the purple of the cabbage contrasting against the orange mandarins and the green flecks of onion. The sweet and sour flavor of the dressing is mellowed by the toasted pine nuts, which give the salad a depth and richness. Because I had some red cabbages left from my garden, I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, and the sweet and sour dressing complemented the oiliness of the turkey and gravy very nicely. I will definitely make this salad again--especially for events when I want my dishes to be especially eye-catching.",
