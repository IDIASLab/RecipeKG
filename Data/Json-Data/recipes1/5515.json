Anyway, I had used the OTHER recipe and substituted spice cake mix and used 2 cans of apples (other recipe called for one but was DEFINITELY not enough).  Actually, the other recipe turned into THIS recipe when I made it a second time, including the mix of spices.  In addition, rather than using butter on the top, when the cake cooled I frosted it with Dulce de Leche (caramel) frosting and BOY, what that ever good!  That cake disappeared in seconds!  This cake is definitely for someone with a sweet tooth who likes fall/spice flavors and a wet cake rather than dry and fluffy.  I thought it was awesome and would have eaten the whole cake myself if I could!  It's absolutely one of the easiest cakes you can make, it comes out great, it tastes spectacular and also goes a long way.  I can see making the chocolate version with canned cherry filling as suggested by another reviewer.  Try this recipe -- you'll love it!  And thanks for the submission!",

I added the spices to 1 1/4 c. water two tbsp. cornstarch a little lemon juice and a half cup of sugar. Once that thickened I added it to the pie filling and apples. I haven't tried it yet but it smells wonderful. TIP: It's best if you cut the butter/margerine into thin slices and layer them on top of the dry cake mix/nuts. Makes for a better crust.",
