I changed a few things to make this a softer cookie: instead of apple juice I used apple cider and I added 1/3 cup of unsweetened applesauce, I also used only 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup of splenda. I also omitted the raisins and used 3/4 cup pecans instead of walnuts. This recipe turned out delicious and is perfect for a vegan like me!!",

I modified the recipe by using dried cranberries instead of raisins substituting whole wheat flour for half the white (and adding a little extra liquid to compensate) and putting a few drops of lemon icing sugar glaze on the top of each cookie. I also didn't add nuts because my kids have nut sensitive friends. Excellent but it took a little longer to cook than the recipe indicated. I would try the recipe again with slightly less brown sugar (maybe only a cup) slightly less fat and all whole wheat flour.",

I used 2/3 c. and that was a bit too much so maybe 1/2 c.? This is a great fall cookie recipe and I'm sure will be a staple for my boys for years to come!",
