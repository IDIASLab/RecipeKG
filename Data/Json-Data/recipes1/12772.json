This is a great, easy recipe I'll be making over and over again, because they're addictively yummy! One tip: when spreading the crust, put it in the pan in a lump and use a sheet of plastic wrap and your hands to smooth it out. It's really fast, doesn't stick and there's no mess.",

                "reviewBody": "After reading the reviews, I made this recipe as follows: Crust is 3/4 cup powdered sugar, 3/4 cup softened butter, 1/4 tsp. salt, 2 cups flour.  Mix that stuff and press into pan.  I was worried that pressing the mixture into the pan would make them difficult to get out, but they came out just fine.  Anyway, bake at 315F (yes, 315) for 15-18 minutes.  They will be maybe the slightest bit golden in color.  You do NOT want the crust to be browned all over or it will be much too crunchy.  Now the filling: 4 eggs, 1 1/4 cups white sugar, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1/4 cup flour, 2 Tbsps. lemon zest (basically all the zest from the lemons you use), and 3/4 to 1 cup of fresh lemon juice.  1 cup of juice took me 5 lemons.  This mixture will be pretty runny.  Pour over baked crust and put this in the oven at 350F.  Be sure to increase your oven temperature now.  Bake for 20 min.  Let these cool completely.  This is crucial.  Then sprinkle powdered sugar on top and store covered on the kitchen counter.  I'm so glad I read everyone's reviews and was able to utilize their suggestions.  That's what allrecipes is about.  Sharing recipes and improving them.  I will totally make these again.  By the way, I used other people's changes because so many people complained that the crust was too oily.  Trust me, with my revisions the crust was like a wonderful sugar cookie or shortbread and was plenty sweet and buttery with the 3/4 cup powdered sugar in the crust batter.  A really great recipe! :)",

You want the butter cold and work it into the dry ingredients w/a pastry blender until the mixture resembles cornmeal. In the end, the crust should resemble shortbread. I like to add lemon zest to my crust for extra flavor. The second is, the filling needs to be doubled for a 9x13 or you will have more crust than lemon layer. Also, make sure you line the pan with parchment paper or foil if nothing else. It will allow you to lift the whole thing out and cut it.I have to admit I'm a lemon bar snob and have gone toe to toe with friend in lemon bar cook-offs. This is a good basic recipe. Don't be afraid to play around with it.",

Decreased the butter in the crust by 2T. Lined my pan with Reynolds Release foil and then sprayed with Pam. I very firmly pressed the crust into the pan and baked at 315 degrees for 15 minutes-PERFECT! For the filling I added 1T flour to thicken up the sticky filling a bit (I was serving this as a finger food!). I used Minute Maid real frozen lemon juice and decreased the amount just slightly to counteract a slightly bitter aftertaste in the first batch. Then baked at 300 degrees for about 30-35 minutes until set-PERFECT. Everything was perfectly done not too brown. Bars cut up very easily didn't stick to anything with the foil. Dusted with powdered sugar and put the squares on a nice serving platter. A real hit! Great easy recipe with basic ingredients! Thanks so much!",

This is no soggy, wimpy crust!  As I always do when I make any lemon bar recipe, I made 1-1/2 times the filling, keeping the crust measurements the same. I used a combination of lemon and lime juice (1 cup for a 1-1/2 filling recipe) and 1 T. of mixed lemon and lime zests.  The crust was firm but tender, the filling tart, sweet and substantial.  They don't cut as neatly because of the extra filling... but who cares?  These are lemon heaven!",

Update: I tried baking the crust at 315 as someone else suggested. I did not work out for me at all....The crust was mushy and greasy from the butter. Also I substituted lime juice for lemon juice just to see what the filling would taste like. The difference was negligible and the lime juice made the filling sorta brown and still tasted more like lemons than limes. I'm going to stick with baking the crust @ 350 for 17 mins and using fresh lemon juice. Oh and I also line the pan with parchment paper....very important step as they come out of the pan way more easily. UPDATE # 2. FINALLY figured out how to get great crust. I used my Cuisinart to blend the ingredients and added the butter partially frozen. Pulsed it until it was lightly crumbled. Perfect!",
