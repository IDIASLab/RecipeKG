My recipe I had you made it in a little square 9x9 dish!!!!!!! It is so perfect. The crust I use is what makes the recipe absolutely delicious- 1c flour 1c sugar 1/2 c chopped walnuts 1 stick of butter you just bake that for about 10 minutes. It is way better than graham cracker crust.",

It made a little more than would go in the crust so I just put the leftover in a parfait cup with some of the cherry pie filling I put on top of the pie.  Make sure you don't use a mixer to fold in the cool whip, fold it in by hand.  Also, it is critical for the flavor for it to be chilled for the amount the recipe states.  The flavor is much better that way.  My husband said he liked this pie much better than a dense baked cheesecake.  I think I agree although I don't think I would pass up either!",

After reading other reviews and because we don't eat as healthy as we should...lol increased Cream Cheese to 2-8 oz packages (instead of 1) increased sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1 tsp vanilla. Then added just a little more vanilla and sugar to suit our tastes. This is so much easier than baking a cheesecake and really does have the cheesecake flavor just not as heavy as far as the texture.
