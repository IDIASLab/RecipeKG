I made it twice this weekend - first by hand, following the recipe (although i had to add 1/2 cup of additional water to the dough), then i tried it making with the bread machine on dough cycle and baking it in the oven. When i make it in the breadmachine in the future, i won't pre-cook the oatmel - it becomes a big \"lump\", and is hard for the machine to handle. Also, i reduced the brown sugar to 1 tbsp, substituted 1 cup of whole wheat for bread flour, and 1/4 cup of wheat gluten for bread flour. Very tasty bread - I didn't think it was dense. I would highly recommend it!",

I like it because it has more oatmeal per loaf than other recipes (1 1/2 cups per loaf). I also like it because it is sweetened with brown sugar instead of honey which is cheaper and I always have some on hand. The bread is chewy and a little sweet. I have made it twice by hand. The first time it was a little dense as other reviewers noted. The second time I added a little more water to the water/oats mix (maybe 1/4 cup) and it turned out perfect. Also I substituted an equal amount of canola oil for the shortening.",

Great for toast and grilled sandwiches, and also a nice hearty tuna and veg sandwich. Nice light crumb. Just the kind of bread my family loves. Thanks for the great recipe!",

I cooked the oatmeal as directed, but only let it cool 10 minutes or so, just cool enough to handle. I added half the flour, worked it a bit, then added the rest -- it wasn't quite dough yet, but I turned it out and worked it until it formed, then added enough extra water to make a good moist dough (oatmeal bread dough will be quite sticky until you've worked it enough, but it's important that the dough not be dry or you'll end up with a brick. A dough scraper is a great tool to have). I let it rise twice, then baked in dark pans at 325 degrees for 40 minutes. To make it fabulous, I rubbed the heck out of the top crust with a stick of butter as soon as I took it out of the oven.",
