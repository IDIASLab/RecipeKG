After simmering with the rice for an hour they got pretty soft. Also be careful when you put the soup in the blender - because it is so hot it flares up when you run the blender. Leave plenty of room for steam to escape - it might be safer to blend it in two batches of 1 cup each unless your blender pitcher is larger than normal.",

I would even say it was silky lol. I added two garlic cloves and used a grocery store rotisserie chicken. Served with \"cheese bread\" from this site. Very filling!

A change I made was reducing the broth to about 6 cups because I only had about 1 cup wild rice and I like my soup to be thicker. You absolutely must season this soup or it will be bland! I used creole seasoning to flavor instead of salt and pepper (creole is a staple in our kitchen). Thanks for the awesome and EASY recipe!",
