I also cut up the chicken into cubes and brown slightly before adding to the baking dish.  The mexican blend shredded cheese works great even if you don't like the chili powder in it.  One other helpful hint is to mix the soup and milk together and add the rice, then pour over chicken in casserole dish.",

I used chicken broth instead of water and I cut the chicken into large chunks and mixed it into the soup mixture rather than laying whole breasts out on top. I did not add salt and don\u2019t think anyone needs to given the amount of salt in the condensed soup.  I greased the bottom of the pan a bit with some butter then threw in the fresh green beans and mushrooms (my choice for this dish). Then I poured the soup mixture in. Prior to cooking, I topped it with a sprinkling of garlic powder, a little bit of shredded cheddar, parmesan and bacon bits. Cooked for the 45 min. and everything was nicely cooked. YUM!!",

My mother's recipe was very similar to this, and as I remember, it was quite bland as well (made better only by cheese salt and pepper)....  I've since updated and revised her recipe just a tad.  This makes for the most incredible tasting casserole and is even easier this way...  I used chicken thighs, only because I prefer dark meat.  Rather than using cream of chicken, I use cream of mushroom soup.  Instead of white rice, I use a package of Knorr Chicken Rice side.  Garlic powder, salt, pepper, and onion powder on the chicken, and there is NO issue with it being bland!  The chicken rice side has so much flavoring that combined with the chicken and soup, it makes this absolutely awesome.......",

But it's full of veggies and lean protein, clean up is minimal, and all I had to do was pull it out of the oven and plop it on the table.  This will not go down in the hall of fame for great meals I've prepared but it did its duty.  I used chicken broth instead of water, threw in a big dollop of sour cream, and topped with bread crumbs instead of cheese.  So the family was not pouring on the compliments but I have to admit that our table has probably not seen the last of this easy weeknight meal.",
