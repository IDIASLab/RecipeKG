I didn't have even a half pound of shredded carrots so subbed in some potato. I shredded 1 large potato, then rinsed it in cold water, & squeezed out the excess water.  Next I took about 3 cups of shredded carrots and put them in the microwave for 30 sec bursts three or four times (until they seemed to soften some... I wanted them to be done when the potatoes were done,) stirring between each burst. Then I mixed the potato and carrot together with seasonings (salt, garlic, onion powder, salt, a dash of cayenne and black pepper.)  Added 1/3 cup barely cooked finely chopped onions (again I used the microwave) and a couple of tablespoons of flour mixing well.  I molded them into patties as firmly as I could and fried them in an oiled pan over medium heat(I brushed my nonstick pan with oil.) Just before I turned the patties over I put about a 1/4 tsp of butter on top of each patty, which gave them excellent flavor and kept them from burning. (No eggs and no crumbs at all.) HINT: Like hashbrowns they stick together best if you wait until the bottom is somewhat crisp before you turn them, and don't keep turning them over and over again.",

I am grateful I did.  First off...\"thanks for sharing this, Haggith!\".  I added some chopped leeks with ours because I had them leftover from another dinner.  Next time I may add a stronger onion or maybe even caramelize the leeks first because the recipe \"as is\" could use a little lift.  I'm sure onion soup mix could help if you can stand the salt.  I still give this 5 stars because of the entire package;  the idea, the use of carrots, how well it cooked, and because it was pleasing to look at (has potential to be even more colorful with different ingredients).  However, I didn't like how messy it was to patty them (but who does?!?).  These will be fun to play around with in the future.  Thanks again.",

I prepared them basically as written (used whole wheat bread crumbs and a GIGANTIC clove of garlic - about the size of 3 average cloves). I saw that I was out of regular vegetable oil so I used my olive oil. YUM! I think frying in olive oil and using the giant garlic clove were the two keys to success here. I served topped with plain yogurt and walnuts. Those of you who thought they were bland and added all kinds of spices and gooped them up with chili sauce and soy sauce and who-knows-what should try frying them in olive oil and letting the delicious flavor of these patties through! I am also confused about why some thought they fell apart. I had no trouble with that.",
