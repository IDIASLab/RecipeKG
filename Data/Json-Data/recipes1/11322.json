If I'm in the mood for a little meatier version I also add a cup of chicken stock & a TBLS of worch. sauce. Sometimes just buying a fancier bun will do the trick to this simple sandwich. Either way the key is the can of chicken gumbo and very good - for a simple can't find anything else in the pantry - meal. Goes great with potato salad.",
