However, I can't believe I am reading the same recipe as the other reviewers. First, the cooking time was way too long.  I took out the cake at exactly 30 minutes (at 350 degrees measured by my oven thermometer) and it was crunchy and burnt.  Check it at about 22 minutes to avoid this problem. Second, slicing the layers in half was a nightmare(with the dental floss method) and created a huge mess.  3) There were WAY too many crumbs.  Instead, I would reocommend making maybe two cupcakes--it would save the slicing hassle and reduce waste.  4) The reciepe is inconsistent in that in the ingredients list it lists 3 squares of chocolate for the filling, but in the instructions it asks for 4 squares (hopefully someone will fix this).  5) I went the conservative route and put three squares of chocolate in the filling and it was WAY TOO MUCH.  The filling and the cake together were really bitter, as cakes go.  I guess if you're a chocoholic who doesn't really like desserts, that might be appealing.  I would either REDUCE the chocolate to maybe 1 or 2 squares or INCREASE the sugar to counteract the bitterness (But I'm not sure what effect that would have on the consistency of the filling).  I used to have black-out cake from a local bakery and LOVED it.  I have been searching for the recipe that would replicate that taste.  This deifinitely isn't it.",

It is totally unnecessary to use a separate bowl to mix just the milk and cocoa powder. Just mix in the cocoa w/ the flour mixture and the milk in with the sugar/shortening mixture. That eliminates one bowl to wash and one extra step which is needless. Also, when making the frosting it is unnecessary to use melted chocolate. Just use Cooa powder. It's easier and again one less step and one less item to clean. Unless you don;t have cocoa powder and already have baking chocolate. It tastes the same and it takes less time and space. Hey, the less steps and cleanign the better, right?",
