While cooking I used salt and pepper to release some of the zucchini and onions natural juices. I also cut the oil down from 2 T. to 1 T. I didn't have pinto beans but garbanzo beans and I only put cheese on the top. We devoured the entire casserole and it was a great way to use up some of my garden's zucchini. Thank you for a tasty recipe!",

The only tweaks I made were to cut the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon and to not put the extra cheese on top of the casserole. Also we assembled the dish over the weekend refrigerated then heated in the oven during the week. I found I had to double the oven time to 40 minutes with the dish being so cold to start with -- so just keep that in mind if you use this approach too.",
