I love the flavor, but I personally put in a little more cinnamon and I add a little all spice to the filling - it generaly turns out very well, but I have to bake it for longer, just experiment, and definitly make it more than once - it took me a couple times to get this down, but it seriously is the best apple pie I've ever made, I love it! almost forgot - I use the butter flavored crisco, and the crust turns out wonderfully",

I also more than doubled the filling to 2 1/2 times. But used 3/4 c. sugar. I prefer a stuffed apple pie. See photo of my pie. I also cover the crust ends for 3/4 of baking time with crust covers. This way the crust stays golden. When using firmer apples like granny smith or greenings; it takes longer to get the apples tender and if the crust isn't covered the ends get too dark and left on the plate.It also doesn't look good.",
