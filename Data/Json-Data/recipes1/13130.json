I used elbow macaroni 1 8oz. can of peas (will use fresh next time) and after I mixed all the ingredients together I put the mixture into a 2 quart greased casserole dish topped with a half cup shredded cheese and then sprinkled with 16 crushed saltines mixed with 3 tablespoons melted butter. Finally the casserole is baked at 350 until bubbling and toasted on top (about 25 minutes). It was great but next time I might use only 6 oz. (one can) of tuna. This is a very versatile recipe that is good and cheezy just how I like it! Would be great with a little hot sauce! Oh yeah my cheese sauce turned out smooth (except for the lumps from the cottage cheese) but I do recommend melting at low heat! Medium heat started to burn my shredded cheese.",

I was in the mood for tuna but hubby wanted mac and cheese. This sounded like a combo of the two so I thought I would give it a try. I did make a couple of substitutions based on personal taste. I used only 1/2 the butter and sauted some onions in it before making the sauce. I also left out the cottage cheese instead using more milk. And I added some garlic powder. This was tasty and very satisfying after a morning of shoveling snow. I will make it again. Btw... some mentioned that the cheddar didn't melt well. Try Kraft Four Cheese Melt in the grated cheese section. It works beautifully in any recipe like this.",
