The cookies were sweet (not too sweet though) - so I believe you can easily use a generous 1 cup sugar without compromising the flavor.  I followed the remainder of the recipe as stated.  These were VERY simple cookies to make on a whim!  I strongly suggest refrigerating the cookies to help them firm/set up properly.  My husband loved them and was surprised to see how easy they are to make!\n\nNOTE:  If you use old-fashioned oats you will need to cook them for at least 4-5 minutes... if you use quick oats then only 1 1/2 minutes.\n\nCan also be made with 1/2 cup peanut butter instead of coconut if desired.",

Just boil the sugar mixture then remove from heat and add the dry stuff (think rice krispy treats). So I thought mine would turn out good since these people must have just done it wrong. Well the oats seem like they NEED to be cooked. The flavor has so much potential but you are chewing on raw oats. I don't get it. If I do this again I will try combining advice and I will boil the mixure for 3 minutes then add the oat mix and cook for another 2 minutes. Maybe it would turn out right? Oh I took advice and reduced sugar to about 1 1/3c. Like I said the flavor makes me think the cookies would be GREAT if the consistency was right.",

They have the consistency of peanut butter. The flavor isn't too bad but don't expect them to taste like cookies. Expect them to taste \"a lot like candy.\" Oh and keep a lot of wet towels around because if you do somehow get them to set they're going to melt in two seconds.",

Second I kept all the ingredients as written except increased coconut to 1 cup. Bring sugar milk marg (or butter) and vanilla to a FULL boil and boil for 2 minutes while stirring constantly. The cookie will be either gooey if less than 2 minute and crumbly if more than 2 minutes. Meanwhile mix all the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Dump the boiled liquid over the dry ingredients stir together and drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper. They should hold together OK after 30 mins and beautifully after an hour.",
