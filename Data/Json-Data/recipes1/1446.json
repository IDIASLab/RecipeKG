I do half and half oil/applesauce and subsititute and reduce to 2 cups of sugar - plenty sweet! 1 cup brown sugar for the white. The brown sugar adds so much more richness and depth of flavor than just using all white sugar.  I did start using at least 3 cups zucchini.  It melts and disappears into the bread and all you end up tasting is the cinnamon. So 3-4 cups is best, with true zucchini flavor. It won't be green, trust me. No nuts needed or draining/squeezing out the zucchini either.  The water adds to the moistness of the bread.  55 min. cook time for me.  I did 60 min. the first time and it wasn't as moist.  I live in the city, so I don't have a garden, but since zucchini is available year round, you can make this anytime of the year.  Super quick and easy to make and my 2 and 5 yr. old inhale this stuff.  Don't tell them about the veggies and they won't know it's there!!",

By trial and error, I discovered that the topping works best when added 15 minutes into the baking time. That way, the topping stays on top rather than sinking down into the batter as the bread bakes.  I made 5 mini-loaves and baked a total of 40 minutes.  (Crumb Topping:  1/2 c. regular oats, 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. flour, 1/4 t. cinnamon, 1/4 c. butter.)",

This is the kind of recipe that I would make copies of to share with friends. Really delicious. As always I prepare the recipes exactly as they are submitted. I believe this is the only fair way to offer a review. If a cook adds or subtracts from the original then they are not preparing the recipe as written and really should not base there opinion on the end result. I usually just ignore the reviews that say \"I added this or added that\"! I am a big supporter of preparing the dish as written and then reviewing that result. I don't dabble with the recipe until after I have prepared it properly as submitted. This is one of the few recipes that I would give 5 stars to.",

I didn't realize just how much zucchini I would end up with.  Well, I found this receipe, and began making zucchini bread.  I made zucchini bread off this receipe, sometimes 6 breads in one week!  Her neighbors were so happy to see me coming with zucchini bread, however my Mother said each and everytime \"make sure you are leaving me a loaf or 4!!\"  \nMy Mother loved loved this bread, so did the neighbors and myself as well!

I also make substitutions to ingredients to make the recipe a bit healthier without compromising the taste.  For this recipe I did the following substitutions:  1)  for the flour I used half white (1 1/2 C) and half whole wheat (1 1/2 C).  2)  I cut the salt in half (1/2 t) 3)  Instead of 3 eggs, I used 2 egg whites and 2 mashed bananas 4) I used half the oil (1/2 C) and added 1/2 C of plain applesauce  5) I decreased the sugar to 1 C.  I scooped the batter into a muffin pan and convection baked it for 11 minutes.  The muffins were wonderful and the whole family gobbled them up.",
