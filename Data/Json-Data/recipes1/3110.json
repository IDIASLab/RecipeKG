I think the Sugar Cookie Frosting I used made it a little better. Refrigerating this dough is not crucial for making these cookies. This dough was plenty firm enough and I think the refrigeration made them a little more difficult to work with. Make sure you keep an eye on them and not to burn them and you'll have to flatten them with your hand they don't spread. I'd make these again only using a different flavor of pudding mix. I bet chocolate would be good. I'd like to work with this recipe and see if I can't make it a little less dry. Not sticking it in the fridge would help and possibly adding half a mashed banana.",
