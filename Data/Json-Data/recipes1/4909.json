I did make some changes, I used a whole chicken and stuffed the cavity with one onion cut up in quarters and 3 cloves of crushed garlic. I also used poultry seasoning, garlic powder, Mrs. Dash, and paprika to season the chicken with. I used the foil balls, but put 2 cups of chicken broth on the bottom, and put the slow cooker on high for two hours and then turned it on low for 5 hours and it came out Great! It didn't fall off the bone because I didn't want to over cook it, but it was SO tender, I didn't even need a knife to cut it! My kids ate it all, I was hoping for leftovers for chicken salad, but there was none!",

I added 1/2 c. chicken broth and lots of seasoned salt and pepper, too. The veggies were nice and soft and the flavor of this slow cooking was wonderful and EASY !!! Thanks 'Cotton' !!!",

I put it on low and cooked it for about 11 hrs while I was at work.  When we got home, it smelled wonderful!  I used some of the juice from the bottom to drizzle over the chicken.  It had a light golden color and looked very good.  There was no point trying to pick it up because it fell apart soon as I tried. The meat was very tender and juicy.  Only thing I would change is to remove all the skin from the chicken next time before seasoning.  The skin slid right off when it fell apart and so, naturally, a lot of the flavoring was gone.  The only other thing I may try to different if I leave the skin on is to try and buy those flavor injectors, to get some more of the flavoring down into the meat.  Otherwise, outstanding!",

I was concerned about using the foil so I used coarsely chopped onion carrot and garlic on the bottom of the slow cooker. I liberally seasoned the chicken (I used a 3 pounder) with salt pepper paprika and rotisserie chicken seasoning. I also placed some of the chopped veggies in the chicken cavity. To make sure the chicken didn't dry out I added about 1 1/2 cups of apple wine I had on hand. I cooked the chicken on low for about 8 1/2 hours and it turned out great. Very flavorful and moist. When it was done I fished out the veggies and strained the liquid. I thickened it just a little with cornstarch and served the sauce over the chicken with cooked white rice. My husband said it was the best chicken he'd ever tasted. Thanks!",

After seasoning the chicken, put it on cheeseclose, tie a loose knot, and then when it's done, you can just pick it up by the cloth and move it to a dish for carving. I use this method when I make chicken soup too, pull the meat apart and no bones to drain out. ",
