The reviewer who disliked this recipe the most thought the batter was too thick and attempted to thin it out... ignore this suggestion as buckle batters are generally more thick than most people are used to seeing. Also be sure to use non-expired baking powder or the buckle may collapse when removed from the oven... this would lead to a much less pleasant texture. Beware that the fresh baking powder increases the chances of the buckle overflowing the pan and using another reviewer's suggesting of a higher-sided springform pan is a great way to avoid that problem.",

The flavour well aside from the berries there was no flavour. This was too dense and was not desert-like enough for me. I will not make this again. It wasn't horrible it was edible and looked ok but I don't want to have to keep trying different variations. I will find a similar but better recipe on this site. Hubby and I both give it a 3.

                "reviewBody": "I don't know why my experience with this was so much different than most others but for me this was a total flop on a number of fronts some I should have anticipated. First with a glass baking dish as this recipe calls for the heat is too high - it should be reduced by 25 degrees to 350 degrees. Second I am quite familar with buckles so I know the batter is thick - but this was even thicker than most sticky and difficult to spread. Third for this size pan two pints of fruit is too much. Were I to make this again (and I'm sure I won't) I would either use half as much fruit a pan with taller sides or a larger pan altogether. I don't know if my pints are larger than others' pints but this overflowed the pan and made a mess in my oven. (The bright side of that is that my oven got cleaned afterward) Finally the baking time is off particularly if you're using a glass pan - start checking this at 50 minutes 25 minutes less than what the recipe states! Finally the topping which I assumed would be a streusel is greasy even to the touch and unattractive. I was curious so after this debacle I checked other similar recipes and sure enough the butter should be HALF the amount called for! This was a disaster but sort of an ugly duckling (I'm wondering if this is why the only picture posted for this to date is by AllRecipes!) because it did taste good. This has potential if you care to work with it but as written with no changes this is a very weak two stars.",

The only suggestions I have to make is that when you're making the topping do not use a half cup of butter because the topping will come out too moist. I made several attempts at the topping until I realized that you only need to use a 1/4 cup of butter to get the right consistency for the topping. Also the recipe says to bake the buckle for an hour and fifteen minutes but you only need to bake it a little over an hour. Other than the few things I needed to change this was the best buckle recipe that I ever made.",
