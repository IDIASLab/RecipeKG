(Fuji's are less acidic and sweeter) - Quartered Almonds instead of Walnuts. - Fresh Cherries (pitted myself!) instead of Raisins. (I just never have liked raisins) - No Ginger Root at all. I also used a \"pie pumpkin\" as that was all my grocery store had. It was approximately the size of a Pumello fruit and there was enough to serve 8 people using the contents as a topping on Pound cake. Absolutely fabulous!",
