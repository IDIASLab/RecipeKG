However, the marshmallow creme stirs in like a dream and adds a fluffiness that I've never see in a buttercream! This frosting melts in your mouth and the almond flavor is delectable. I was looking for a delicious, light textured frosting for delicate, tiny sandwich cookies I'm making for a wedding. This is marvelous, and I will use it again and again! SIX YEARS LATER: I\u2019ve used this incredible buttercream recipe for every single cake I\u2019ve made, from my signature carrot cake to my grandchildren\u2019s birthday cakes, and it ALWAYS turns out perfect, makes a huge quantity, tastes delicious, decorates beautifully! I just made it again today for my carrot cake! A lifetime recipe, in my opinion! (At times I use 1/2 almond extract and 1/2 vanilla extract, just as my mood dictates.)",

                "reviewBody": "I was so excited to try this recipe.  I love marshmallow and buttercream so I thought this was a match made in heaven.  I was so disappointed.  It was so sickening sweet, I wouldn't even use it as-is.  Even having read the reviews, I used short cups of powdered sugar, so probably used about an 1/8 - 1/4 cup less than the recipe called for.  In an attempt to salvage all these ingredients, I bought another small jar of marshmallow cream and folded that into the frosting.  That did help mellow out super sweet powdered sugar taste a little.  My advice to anyone making the 1st time it is to add only 2 cups (or less) or powdered sugar.  Then at the end set maybe a 1/4 of the butter/sugar mixture off the side.  Add the marshmallow cream to the remaining butter/sugar mixture.  If it not too sweet, fold some of the butter/sugar mixture back into the marshmallow cream mixture.  That way you can better control the sweetness level.  This recipe makes so much, you probably won't miss any extra butter/sugar you don't use. If you have extra, you can always adjust your recipe for next time.",

Normally I don't like to rate recipes after I've made so many changes, however this gave me such a good base that I wanted to share. Also there was plenty of frosting for my cake which I made in a 9x13 pan. Now for my changes: first I only used 1 cup (2 sticks) of room temperature butter, decreased the confectioners sugar to 2 cups, added 1/2 tsp of \"clear\" vanilla (instead of almond), and only one 7 1/2 oz  jar of marshmallow cream. I mixed the butter and confectioners sugar together until well blended, then added the vanilla, mixed again, lastly I added the marshmallow cream and blended it together with my mixer. This was easy and ready to frost my (cooled) cake. This frosting came out white, soft, and was very light (not a heavy frosting at all). It was a BIG hit with my family! This is definitely now my go to recipe for white frosting. I might even try adding 1/2 cup cocoa powder for a chocolate version next time. Enjoy!\nEven though I made many changes I want to thank Staci for sharing your recipe. I never thought of adding marshmallow cream to my buttercream frosting, and I think it made all the difference. :-)",
