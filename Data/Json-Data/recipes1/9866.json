Maybe next time I will try blending the raspberries first with the milk and then putting them through a strainer.

To compensate I tossed in more raspberries (frozen) than called for and used peach rather than plain yogurt. Left out the sugar at Hubs' request and he was happy with the result. On the positive side of using not so juicy and sweet cantaloupe however I didn't experience the smoothie being watery as others reported. In fact I had to add a little half-and-half to get the blender going. I'm not a big smoothie fan; I make these particularly for Hubs but I found this lighter more refreshing than others most likely due to the mildness of the cantaloupe. Given my cantaloupe's rather bland condition this was a great way to use it to its best advantage.",

The cantaloupe I used was sweet enough so I didn't need the additional sugar. This doubled well for four servings but it wasn't near enough for four people. The combination of the cantaloupe and raspberries was wonderful. I agree with Scotdog that it could use a little vanilla flavoring or vanilla yogurt like she used.
