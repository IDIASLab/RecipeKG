I add the sea salt after shredding the pork, because of the saltiness of the soy sauce. Then place in oven to combine the flavors.  I got my recipe from a lovely Hawaiian grandmother.",

And, this one comes pretty close.  Total prep time is a few minutes and clean up, because of the foil, is a breeze.  Pork butt is also an inexpensive cut of meat.  I've made this recipe using only Kosher salt (because sea salt wasn't available) and I've also used regular sea salt (as opposed to Hawaiian sea salt).  If you decide to use Kosher salt, you may have to sprinkle a little more onto the cooked pork before serving.  In the end, there's really no noticible difference.  The Kalua pork is also VERY tender.  I recommend this recipe.",

The authentic Hawaiian style combines garlic powder and Hawaiian salt to rub any meat used (pork, chicken, beef).  The pan is lined with foil, then layered with banana leaves (frozen at Asian markets) which have been washed.  The meat is placed on the leaves, liquid smoke sprinkled over top and then wrapped well.  Leaves, then foil tightly enclosed.  Couple cups of water at the bottom of the pan.  Slow roast for hours, check water only.  Only open foil near end to check doneness.  Serve with sweet potato, poi, rice, long rice and/or poki, pineapple, haupia.  We start roasting at 9pm and leave until 9am at 300 degrees.",

No need to measure....Just slap liquid smoke around the meat, then salt, and follow direction.  Tip: for best flavor, insert slices of fresh garlic around the roast.  Dont even need to check temperature.  Bake in 400 degree for first hour, then 350 for another 3-4 hrs. depending on size.  Bring it out of oven and check the old fashion way.....open, see, and feel....If its tender and almost falling apart.....its ready.   If not, throw it back in. However, if you want that greasy, roasted, underground flavor....here's the secret:  \"sesame oil\"  ohhhyeaaaaaaah!!  Save all the liquid in foil.  You should have alot of liquid, if not, then its overcooked.  Dont know why people add water instead of using real thing.  In baking pan, combine shredded pork & liquid from foil, drizzle few drops of sesame oil, add more salt if needed, black pepper as needed. Mix well and heat in 350 oven, covered, for 30-40 mins. or till thorouly heated thru. For big parties, I would refrigerate in ziploc bags after mixing,  then continue with last step the next day.  Throw some chopped green onions for flavoring & color. Good with baked sweet potatoes.  Its \"ONO\"LICIOUS!",

This recipe is delicious and perfect for a crowd or party - as it makes a lot of food with minimal effort!  I did make modifications based on other reviewers suggestions, and have prepared this two different ways.  This recipe is best in the oven, NOT a slow cooker - the oven method was much more tender and flavorful.  I did make modifications, which I think added tothe recipe. My modifications were as follows:  3 T. minced garlic, 1 T. minced ginger AND increased the Liquid Smoke to 2 T.  The additional Liquid Smoke really makes this recipe pop! I will definitely be making this again and again!  Several people asked for the recipe.  I've tried this both ways - once wrapped with tinfoil (the BEST!) and once wrapped with banana leaves.  Both were very, very good.  You can't go wrong with this one with the modifications.  Be SURE to use Hawaiian Sea Salt... it makes all the difference!",
