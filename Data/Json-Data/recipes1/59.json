I spent a tortured night tossing and turning, hearing muffled voices from the oven whispering \"we're ready.\"  The insides of the middle cookies on the bottom rack were hollow and gooey (and tasty), but it may have been because I only heated the oven to 350.  I made the first sheet with vanilla only and added maple flavor to the rest.  It was heavenly.  I'll try heating to the correct temperature next time and maybe put some bricks in the oven to slow down the cooling time.",
