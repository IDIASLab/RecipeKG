I cut the oil a bit and added more juice (I used bottled lime juice), and I omitted the zest as I had none. The batter is thicker than cake but thinner than cookie, so I put 1/8 C batter in muffin tins lined w/ paper muffin cups, added 1 1/2 tsp cherry jam, than another 1/8 C batter. I baked for 25 min @ 375' and I'm delighted w/ the turnout! I'm sending overseas w/ a can of cherry frosting. Fabulous! Thinking of adding chopped cranberries next time.",

After reading all the reviews I made the following changes: Used a touch extra baking soda and powder added extra lemon extract and juice (probably about double what was written) plus a few Tbsp. rum and a few drops vanilla (I like lots of flavor) 1/4 cup room temp butter and 1&1/2 Tbsp oil replaced 1/2 cup regular sugar with 3/4 cup powdered sugar but that exchange was out of necessity I ran out of sugar! It is a light cakey type cookie and still could use a few adjustments... But I was looking for a lemony cookie that would still be soft after a week in the mail and from experience the cake like cookies are some of the best for that.",
