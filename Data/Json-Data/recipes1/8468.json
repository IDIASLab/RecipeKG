A really good cold-weather comfort food. When you're feeling 'bogged' down, make Chicken Bog to cheer up! This recipe is what is called 'Low Country cooking.'  It is a term used in the coastal regions of South Carolina. Chicken Bog is even served at restaurants in South Carolina along with other local favorites.",

But on the downside, the Italian Seasoning is a u-turn in the wrong direction from the roots of this dish. I use about 2 lbs of meat- I generally use boneless skinless chicken thighs. To your biggest stock pot add the chicken.  If you\u2019re using a whole chicken just cover it so that there is about 2 inches of water above the chicken. If you\u2019re using parts use enough water so that it would cover the chicken even if you had double the amount of meat in the pot. Then add two halved onions, 2 carrots and 2 celery ribs cut so that they submerge about 10 whole cloves of garlic 2-4 bay leaves and 2 tbls black whole peppercorns and salt (\u00bd tsp salt/cup water).  Then boil\u20263 hours should do the trick. When you\u2019re done cooking the meat scoop out the meat and put it in a bowl and shred it when it is cool enough.  Throw out the aromatics \u2013 all that should be left is the broth \u2013 no need for bouillon or canned broth. If you used a whole chicken, you may want to skim off the fat. Measure your broth and then use the correct amount of rice. Put the chicken back in the pot with the broth, put in a diced link of (cooked) smoked sausage on top of the chicken and put the rice on top of the sausage and bring it to a boil. Cover it, reduce the heat to simmer and cook 20 minutes.  Stir well and taste- add a little pepper or salt and serve.",

I only boiled it for about 10 minutes on med-high heat and the rice burnt to the bottom and the whole dish tastes like smoke.  I assume now she means bring to a boil then simmer for 30 minutes.  If I had done this, I think it would have turned out great (I also omitted the italian seasoning, my husband said that is not how it is normally made)  I am sure most of you seasoned cooks knew what she meant, but I am not, so for all of you non-professionals I burned the rice for you so now you do not have too!!!!",

We like ours with more rice so I increased to 1 1/2 cups rice and 4 1/4 cups of chicken broth.  As others have stated, make sure you bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to low and cover for 30 minutes (don't peak).  The rice turns out perfect this way.

BUT i would omit the italian seasoning and add plenty of pepper as one reviewer said. I use smoked sausage for my chicken bog.  The origins of this recipe date to civil war times when soldiers had one pot to cook everything in. A big ole stock pot!  I have used a large pack of chicken thighs for this recipe as well.  I also use bagged rice such as mahatma brand for this recipe.  I personally have never used boullion in my recipe and just put everything in one pot.  I have even left the bones in it when cooking it.  Salt and alot of pepper are the key!  Its not a pretty recipe and i always leave the fat in there!  its suppose to be a little greasy.",

My mom and I used to do the whole chicken thing but we've started taking shortcuts. Instead of taking all the time to boil a whole chicken and make our own broth I just buy like Swanson chicken broth. And I buy a traditional flavored rotissery chicken and peel the skin off then shred the meat. I then pour the broth into my pot and add sausage rounds and chicken and then bring it to a boil before adding the rice. This incorporates the flavor of the sausage into the broth. Then you add your rice salt and pepper to taste and simmer it till it's cooked. Like I said it's a short cut and cheating for sure but it takes a lot less time and tastes just as good. It never lasts very long around my house.",
