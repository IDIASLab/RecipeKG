I barely fit the whole thing in my trifle bowl and thought that I should have used only 2/3 of the cake as someone else suggested; however after sitting in the refrigerator overnight it sunk a little because of the sheer weight of it all. Perfect! I used a 7 oz. \"Symphony\" chocolate/toffee bar but didn't taste as much toffee as I would have liked. Next time I used an 8 oz. bag of Heath Toffee Bits (found in the baking aisle) - MUCH better and no chopping involved!! This cake is always a hit. Thanks for the recipe!",

In my opinion I think that the crushed broken Skor bars work the best. I will make my own chocolate pudding when time permits me to do so. Nice recipe. Thanks for sharing!!!",
