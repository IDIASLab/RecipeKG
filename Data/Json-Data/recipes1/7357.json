I discovered this when I used the mix three weeks after it was made, and I ended up with a bloody finger after having to pry the brown sugar out with a knife. My suggestion is, blend the brown and white sugars together before packing into the jar, so that the brown sugar can't harden into a chunk. Perhaps not as pretty, but definitely more practical -- and more safe. I have to say, though, that I am not crazy about  the idea of giving a cookie mix as a gift. I mean, if you care enough to give, why not go to the trouble to bake a batch of cookies for someone?",

A good idea for a gift is to make a batch of the cookies to give with the cookie mix in a jar. It's immediate gratification and they will know what their batch will taste like!",

The baking soda/powder could be tasted slightly so could be reduced but it was not overpowering and didn't leave a bitter aftertaste. Also I made the recipe with half choc chips and half white choc chips and it turned out great. Lastly I made the order in the jar as follows: 1/2 flour brown sugar white sugar cocoa remaining flour (with baking powder and soda) choc chips pecans. This gave a light dark light appearance to the mix in the jar. Thanks for the recipe Jennifer - it's now one my favourites!!",

Once the ingredients are rearranged (I put the flour powder soda and salt on the bottom then layered dark light dark light and finished with the chips on the top) and the jar tied with a wide red bow the presentation is quite festive. Because nuts are not universally loved I substituted 3/4 C white chocolate chips and 3/4 C semi-sweet chips for the nuts and chips listed in the ingredients. They worked perfectly. Enjoy!",
