                "reviewBody": "I have a favorite Pineapple Zucchini Bread recipe that I've used for probably thirty years and I have never deviated from it until now. This recipe caught my eye as it calls for margarine (I used butter) rather than the typical oil.  While cakes and breads made with butter can tend to be not as moist as those made with oil, the flavor can't be beat. No worries about moistness with this recipe!  It was wonderful.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter and used pecans rather than walnuts. The cinnamon is fairly standard, but I enjoyed the not so typical allspice. All of the flavors, from the pineapple to the spices, contribute to produce a nice balance of flavor.  Nothing screams out at you, and I like that.  It was for that reason that I chose to omit the cinnamon from the glaze and I'm pleased I did. The glaze is a sweet finishing touch to the bread, pleasing to the eye as well as the palate. The nuts certainly add texture and crunch, but this bread is so nicely flavored that the nuts are almost a distraction and I think I'd actually prefer this without them. Just a terrific recipe!",

Was I suppose to drain the juice from the pineapple except for the reserved amount for the glaze? I didn't... maybe that was the problem. Very flavorful. Will make again. Glaze added special touch to the loaf. Thanks for sharing.",
