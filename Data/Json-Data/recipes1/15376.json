It was hard keeping my family away from them- they loved the almond taste. I left out the chocolate (because it didn't seem very French) which was fine. Make sure you use wax paper or similar or else the bottoms get a bit too dark. This was a wonderful recipe I highly recommend it. Bon app!",

THE BATTER CAME OUT REALLY PASTY AND STICKY WHICH WAS VERY SIMILAR TO MY DAD'S ALMOND COOKIE RECIPE. SO I WORKED WITH IT AS IS. USED A MINI ICE CREAM SCOOP AND PLACED ON A PARCHMINT PAPER LINED COOKIE SHEET. DID NOT PRESS THEM DOWN THEY FLATTENED PERFECTLY IN THE OVEN. THESE WERE SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!

Then I put chocolate frosting between them (which melted when they were warm--it was amazing). Very good and quick recipe!",

After doing a little research online I ended up using 1-1/4 cups ground almonds (for the half recipe that I was making). Not sure if this is correct but they did turn out pretty good. These are kind of a chewy sticky cookie - but they are very tasty! Not sure I'd call them a macaroon (because they really don't have that \"puff\" factor) but they are chewy like a macaroon. Overall I'm glad that I found this recipe to use of the ground almonds that I had on hand. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
