And I did NOT use the whipping cream.  I will warn you though, even with using more ice cream and more ice, you will NOT get the consistency that is in the photo!!!!  It's still runny (but still VERY good!)!  The way to remedy this is to make the batch in the blender and put it in the FREEZER overnight.  Then the next day when you're ready, crush the top frozen layer and blend it again.  That will give you the right consistency!!  I am keeping this recipe and will do it this way every time.  I've had rave reviews when I make this the past few weeks.  My new favorite drink!!!  Thanks for sharing!!",

I only had Coconut Rum on hand so I used that and added a bit more:) Then I added 1cp of coconut gelato (along with the 1cp of Vanilla ice cream). They both were @ Giant. I also used slightly more whipping cream and whipped until very firm peaks. I drank it all in two days. OMG it is soo good. One day I'll try it with Mango rum. DEFINITELY try this recipe! UPDATE: I made this with the Mango flavored rum and it was fantastic. Don't know if it was better with the coconut or mango rum since it was too long inbetween recipes. Either way you can't go wrong. This recipe is delicious!!",
