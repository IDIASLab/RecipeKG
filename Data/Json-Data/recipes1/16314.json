I thought this was REALLY DELISH!  I am not a white wine drinker but I did have a decent bottle on hand - I think that added a delicate aspect to the flavor.  THANKS!! UPDATE: I recently discovered my blood pressure is a bit high, so I am looking to avoid salt.  This in one of my favorite soups.  I never noticed how much salt is in canned beans. \n So I made it with dried cannellini beans, using the 'rapid soak method '(cover with water, bring to a boil, boil 2 minutes, let sit one hour).   I substituted EVOO for the bacon.   Used the same amount of liquid as I had using canned beans.  Cooked soup, covered, on low heat for about 3 hours, although it was probably done in less time than that.   Substituted white and black pepper for the salt.      Good!  Sharing if this helps anyone :>).",
