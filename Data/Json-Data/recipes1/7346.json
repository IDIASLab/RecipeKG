This recipe is great to get you started; I suggest stuffing the cavity with celery & onion and using salt and pepper to flavor the bird in addition to the other seasonings.  I also loosely covered the breast for the first two hours of cooking to keep it moist and took the foil off for the last hour.  I cooked a 15 pounder and it took about 3 1/2 hours on the grill.  Let the bird sit for 30 minutes before you carve it and you will have meat that will knock your socks off!  **Note that the layer of meat below the skin will be pink, some people think the meat is not done but it's what happens when you use the grill!",
