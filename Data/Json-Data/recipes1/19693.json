I've had bison before (roasts and burgers) but never had bison ribs so I was excited to try them. The sauce was flavorful and very different than what I'm used to having with ribs. It was a nice change of pace! The ribs were somewhat tender yet slightly hard to get off the bone. I marinated the ribs for about 6 hours. I will definitely make this recipe again however next time I will cook the ribs in the smoker and serve them with the sauce. The sauce was very citrusy (I used freshly squeezed OJ) and reminded me of something you'd eat in the fall. This would be a perfect meal for a warm fall day. Make sure you grill over indirect heat or else the sauce will burn and the bones will turn black. I didn't need to brush the ribs with extra sauce while they were grilling.",
