I did punch up the orange flavor a lot. Here's how: Used one fresh orange for the zest and then squeezed the juice into the 3/4 measuring cup. Filled the rest of the cup with frozen orange juice concentrate (undiluted. Also, used orange food coloring and an extra egg (yolk and white) for more richness and rise. The texture was super. Light and tender. Heavenly orange flavor. Thank you so much. Made it a third time.\r\n",

The only reason that I gave it a four was because on the recipe it said to place the cake in an ungreased tube pan- and I had a lot of trouble getting it out. I was able to salvage my cake and cover up some of the affected spots with the orange glaze from this site. (Which was very good and complimented the cake nicely.) Everyone seemed quite pleased with the taste of this cake and using the icing like glue- the appearance wasn't all that bad- it actually looked good. Good recipe and I would make it again- Only in a greased pan.",

If you can't find castor sugar in your market, which is simply super fine sugar, put 1-1/2 c. sugar in your food processor and give it a whiz for about 45 seconds to a minute.  The sugar will dissolve in the batter more easily and create and even lighter cake.",

                "reviewBody": "I tried this cake because a friend specifically requested an orange cake. It was then added that it should be \"angel food cake\" like and this picture looked like it so I tried it. First let me just say it is more like pound cake. But the other reviewers are right when they say it needs something to add moisture--it came out kind of dry. Second this is a recipe that is meant to be used with a hand mixer. So if you have a stand mixer like me you are better off putting the whites in the stand mixer's bowl and hand mixing the other portion. Having made the cake twice next time I would modify it to use orange juice concentrate rather than just orange juice or orange juice with a tablespoon of orange extract. (I used a teaspoon and it wasn't enough). Also if you're using fresh zest use a box grater rather than a zesting tool. The first time I made it the zest strings got caught on the mixer blades and the side of the pan and didn't make it in the cake. The second time I made it I used scissors to cut the strands into smaller portions. As other reviewers said you need to spray the pan. I didn't because I have a nonstick pan and it ended up sticking. Finally the cooking time was 35 minutes not 60. The cake didn't rise nearly as much as I expected looking at the picture. You will be fine using a bundt cake pan. Overall it's a good recipe but I think the directions could be a little clearer and modifications need to be made which is why I gave it a 3.",
