I used this in a raspberry chicken recipe (it worked very well) & can't wait to make my own raspberry vinaigrette Not sure if I shouldn't have added a bit of sugar w/ the raspberry....only time will tell. By the way be sure & pick a container that allows for easy removal of the raspberries. I put mine in the decorative container I planned on storing the vinegar in & because of the small spout I had a hard time removing the raspberries (which is essential to keep mold from growing). Next time I will make it in a mason jar allow to set for 2 weeks remove the raspberries & then pour the vinegar into a more decorative container.",
