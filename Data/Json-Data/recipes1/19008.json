                "reviewBody": "The recipe is a good basic one -- I was intrigued by the combination of orange and fennel -- but my family likes more robust flavors than this combination seemed to be as written in the recipe. Therefore I added some chopped fresh cilantro (about 2 T) instead of the tarragon about 1 1/2 teaspoons of Sriracha a light sprinkling of sea salt and lots of ground black pepper. It was outstanding and just the right balance of flavors to complement but not overwhelm the grilled fish. Another small point-- for ease of serving I coarsely chopped the orange segments and chopped the fennel rather finely. It made a really nice spoonable salsa and preserved every bit of the juicy flavor. I served it separately as my husband generally insists he doesn't care for \"sauces\" and I was afraid he wouldn't like it plated over his fish. To my delight he certainly loved this salsa -- he kept spooning more of it over his fish while exclaiming \"This is REALLY good!\" There was none left. That's a major success in this household. Thus 4 stars as written; 5 with some minor adjustments.",
