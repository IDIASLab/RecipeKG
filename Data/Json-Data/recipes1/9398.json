A tip for tastier chips Typically instead of purchasing regular tortilla chips I learned from a gf that you can achieve a restaurant style chip by purchasing tortilla shells (like burrito shells) at your supermarket. Make sure they are the Mexican version because regular ones will be crackly and very oily. Cut them in the desired size and fry them in oil until lightly brown.",
