I\u2019m rating this low because if you make it as is there is not nearly enough fruit and the topping becomes like a hard crust because of too much butter.  So, I made the same changes everyone else recommended:  DOUBLE THE FRUIT to 6 cups (I used about 4 cups rhubarb and 2 cups strawberries).  For the topping I added 1 tsp SALT as well as \u00bc tsp ALLSPICE.  And definitely use only \u00bd CUP BUTTER if you want the crumbly topping shown in the picture.  I made it both ways so I feel confident with these changes.  I did not increase the sugar when I added more fruit and it was sweet enough (rhubarb should have a slight sour).  I made this ahead so I could serve a warm desert and it was great.  I hade the fruit mixture refrigerated in the baking dish and I just kept the topping separate until it was time to put in the oven.  I baked it as directed before I wanted to serve it and topped with vanilla ice cream while it was still warm, yum.  I had many requests for the recipe and many rave reviews.  Hope this helps \u2013 happy baking!",

I also cut the butter to 3/4C and added a bit of salt and cinnamon to the topping.  Otherwise I left the recipe the same.  It turned out pretty good with these changes...a good proportion of fruit to topping and a nice combination of sweetness and tartness.  The low rating is because the recipe needed to be changed in the first place...\"as is\" this recipe wouldn't have enough fruit and 1C of butter seemed excessive.  In my opinion if a recipe has to be altered this much then it is not deserving of such a high rating.",

After reading the 1 star review, I believe they should be removed only because this recipe says RHUBARB CRUNCH, NOT RHUBARB STRAWBERRY CRUNCH.  Just a note to people leaving reviews. Rating someone's recipe low because you did not follow it, is just plain not nice. There is no call for strawberries because it is not strawberry rhubarb crunch... Duh! \nWe made this and it turned out perfect! The topping was perfect, even like the picture. Not sure why other \"cooks\" had such a difficult time? Oh well, everyone is a critic. 5 stars all the way, I love the tart with a hint of sweet and obviously by looking at the recipe, this is what it is supposed to taste like. Everyone I shared the dessert with loved it! Thank you for sharing this with us. Wouldn't change a thing on this RHUBARB Crunch! :)",
