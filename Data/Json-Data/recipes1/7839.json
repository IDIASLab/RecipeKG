I halved it and upon eating decided that it should be halved again. Also halved the garlic. Used fresh tarragon instead of dried in the same amount called for. We like a thicker sauce so doubled the amount of cornstarch. Also used low sodium tamari rather than soy although had I not had the tamari on hand would've used the soy but also in a low sodium variety. Otherwise excellent and will be added to the regular repertoire.",

My mistake! I wanted a quick and easy last minute recipe in which I had all the ingredients on hand and this was it! I questioned the amount of pepper while preparing it and decided not to adjust it. I think it must be two TEASPOONS instead of two tablespoons. It was a quick fix for tonights dinner. We just scraped off the seasonings and enjoyed the most moist tenderloin we have ever eaten! I am already planning on using this recipe for an upcoming large family gathering. They will think I slaved for days preparing this beautiful tasty meal!",
