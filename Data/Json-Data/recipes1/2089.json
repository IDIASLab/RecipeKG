                "reviewBody": "Go check your pantry or your cupboards! If you've got a white cake mix and a can of pie filling you've got a beautiful cake hiding in there! I felt like baking today but it was late in the day and I didn't have much time. I didn't expect much from this other than the speediness factor. After all it was \"just\" a cake mix and a can of pie filling but that was ok since Hubs' staff isn't fussy! I REALLY became skeptical when I realized what it took (nothing really) to get it in the pan and into the oven. But it was almost as if the cake played a trick on me because once it came out of the oven and got all prettied up with the sliced almonds and glaze it was almost like the Ugly Duckling becoming a beautiful swan. I was impressed. It is gorgeous. But I wasn't convinced it would taste half as good as it looked. I was surprised again - it's just delicious - soft and moist creamy and gooey - everything you could ask for. The recipe is a true winner on its own but I think it helped to add a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter and a quarter teaspoon of almond extract to the glaze. Where it called for a \"dash\" of vegetable oil I gave it a \"dribble\" of corn syrup. It kept the glaze soft and gave it a nice sheen while the extracts pretty effectively disguised \"that cake mix taste.\" This is a stunning coffee cake no matter how shamefully easy it is to make. I'd love to try other flavors - apple lemon blueberry strawberry raspberry are all tempting possibilities.",

I used fat free sour cream, only two eggs to hold down the fat and increased the water a little.  The batter should be thick and spread, not pour.  That is how you know you have the batter right.   I too added crumb topping before baking and a few pecans for my husband's muffin.  Crumb topping = 1/4 cup of each cake mix,brown sugar & oatmeal.  Only add about 1-2 tablespoon of Parkay buttery spray (no fat, calories or cholesterol)just to make some crumbs.  It should be a bit powdery.  Thanks for a great recipe",
