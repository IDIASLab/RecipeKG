The swordfish had a slightly fishy taste (which my husband really enjoyed...me not so much) so next time I will use another fish...probably orange roughy. I did not have any fresh red peppers so I subbed some roasted red pepper in a jar. I also used pineapple juice for the pineapple juice concentrate. I am going to use the leftover salsa on some soft chicken tacos...will let you know how it was. Edited to add...OMG! For lunch today I made soft chicken tacos w/ the salsa & it was fanflippingtastic! No exaggeration. I used warm flour tortillas boiled chicken (from this site) that I sauteed in olive oil & mesquite seasonings for a couple of minutes to add flavor (I bet canned chicken would work as well) shredded swiss cheese diced sweet onions shredded lettuce & lots of citrus salsa. It was so good that hubby wanted to know if there was enough left to have for dinner tonight.:o)",

My BIG MISTAKE was not having ever handled jalepenos before I was not aware that one should wear gloves when touching the seeds and membranes of a jalepeno. I paid for it all night with hands that felt like they were on fire! When I did a google search I found that this is a well-documented fact which made me feel really stupid but I don't come from a culture that uses hot peppers so I had no idea. Anyway a word of warning to others who do not know this. Wear gloves you will regret it otherwise.",
