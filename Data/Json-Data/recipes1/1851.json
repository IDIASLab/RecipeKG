(versus 1 hour without mixer) i am so glad to finally find a recipe that doesn't include \"angel food cake mix\" i mean come on! if you want to make a cake you want to MAKE A CAKE! i never have any cream of tartar in the house so it was a relief that this recipe doesn't require it. since i don't have any cake flour (and can never find any in stores) i substituted it with 7/8 cup all-purpose flour and 2 tablespoons corn starch and it worked great! wonderful recipe i will make this many times over and over again.",

I don't have a tube pan so I used three little loaf pans. They turned out great. We used one loaf for chocolate fondue and gave the other two to friends who also said they loved it.

This cake is amazing. Light and fluffy. Perfect. I used a 9 inch round pan and managed to get 3 seperate layers. That's plenty of cake. Mine was finished in 40 minutes so pay attention. 50 minutes in my oven would have dried it out and burned it. Regardles this is a keeper that I'll be making with various fillings. Thanks.",
