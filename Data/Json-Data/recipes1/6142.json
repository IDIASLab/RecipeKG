And for vegetarians it's a refreshing and delicious alternative to soy-based meat substitutes. If you want them to taste more \"sausagey\" try doubling the amount of sage and add a hearty dash of dried basil. When I made this recipe for a holiday party I coated a pan with non-stick spray put the meatballs on it without the sauce and baked for 30 minutes at 325 degrees F in order to brown and firm them up nicely. Then I tossed them into a crockpot and covered them in homemade barbecue sauce (there are several fine recipes on this website). DELICIOUS party appetizer! I'll also consider making them in a white sauce and serving them over egg noodles a la Swedish \"meatballs\". Thank you Janet for posting this recipe! It's definitely on my \"keeper\" list!",
