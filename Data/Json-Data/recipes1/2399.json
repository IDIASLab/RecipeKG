                "reviewBody": "A great cheesecake... with some modifications to suit the taste of my friends. First, I made this crust out of oreos - I think it fits better. I think the chocolate cheesecake would be overwhelming, so I mixed the chocolate with a little bit of the cheescake batter and swirled it throughout the plain batter. I did the same thing with some of the caramel, so when we cut into the cheesecake, you could see the chocolate and caramel ribbons without overpowering the cheesecake. I did put in the layer of caramel and pecans, and it was excellent! I always bake my cheesecakes in a springform pan fit inside one of those silicone cake pans, then place the cheesecake in a roasting pan and put water halfway up the side of the cheesecake pan. This has always worked well for me - I get the benefits of a waterbath without the leaking that foil can do. Before I boxed it up to take to work, I used some Smuckers hot fudge topping to cover the top of the cake in a very thin layer, then placed pecan halves around. Finally, I drizzled what was left of the caramel sauce on top of this cake. It looked beatuiful! I am known for my cheesecakes, and my coworkers were quite impressed. Try this one - you won't be disappointed@",

Instead of melting the chocolate chips and adding to the batter, I added 1 cup of mini semi-sweet morsels to the batter. This made it a little less chocolatey and even prettier. After baking the cheesecake I also drizzled some caramel ice cream topping over the top and then sprinkled a few more mini chocolate chips and chopped pecans. Looked professionally made!!",

Build up the sides of the crust and only pour the caramel close to the edge, but not all the way to the edge.  When I poured it to the edge it made a large build up of caramel that was very hard.  Also, allow the caramel to cool before pouring the cheese mixture on top of it.  When making the cheese mixture, allow the cream cheese to come to room temp before  mixing.  That will make it a richer and smoother filling.  Enjoy!",

I followed reviews and used oreo cookies for the crust added mini choc chips to the batter and softened the cream cheese to room temp before mixing. I baked in a water bath so the caramel wouldn't get hard; turned off oven at end of baking time and let cool in oven about 3 hours before chilling. Cheesecakes came out perfect! To garnish I melted milk choc chips in microwave dipped my fingertips in and flung the chocolate across cakes in opposite directions then I placed pecans around the edge. I posted a photo because it looked so pretty. My friend and family raved about how good it was! I will definitely make again.",
