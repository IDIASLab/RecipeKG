I think a mild purple onion would work but not a strong one so be careful!:-) I will use a ssweet onion next time. The beets and oranges went together beautifully. I did not use canned beets but my own beets: oven roasted in foil peeled and then sliced. It had a good flavor after 2 hours in the fridge. I think it will taste even better tomorrow and perhaps the onions will be milder and easier to eat.",

I also tried bottled orange juice first and then dumped the liquid and used juce from the can of the mandarins instead which was much better! A little rosemary compliments this salad nicely and it looks and tasted beautiful served over a small bed of greens! Although I might add a touch of olive oil or in the future to balance out the overwhelming acidity. Thanks for the recipe!",

For the marinade I used mostly the juice from the oranges (and added regular OJ to make the 2 cups) and only about one cup of apple cider vinegar. I let it marinate about four hours and will take it to a pot luck tomorrow afternoon. I really enjoyed the sample tastes I took of the finished product; I hope others will enjoy it as well.",
