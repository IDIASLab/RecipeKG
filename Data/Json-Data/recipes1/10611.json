After whipping and after preparing the pudding according to the box I gently folded the two together.  I also used fresh strawberries.  I then placed the cubed angel food caked in the bottom, then whip cream and pudding mixture followed by freshly sliced strawberries and continuing for 2 more layers.  I topped the last layer of strawberries with freshly whipped lightly sweetened cream and garnished the top with uncut strawberries. I got rave reviews!  It was light, simple and a perfect change from heavy desserts!  BRAVO!!!",

I used 1 pint of real whipped cream and whipped it fluffy/stiff in my mixer and added about 3 to 4T of sugar to sweeten it and used in place of the frozen whipped topping. I also used lady fingers in place of the  angel food cake. And to keep with the 4th theme, I used fresh strawberries and a row of fresh blueberries(instead of bananas) in the middle. I know I changed a lot of the recipe but I thank T's Mom for inspiring me!",
