Put into jello mold (sprayed mold lightly with cooking spray first and it slipped right out!). Presentation didn't look anything like broken glass so the kids were disappointed - they were expecting to \"eat glass\" but it tasted good. The combination of lemon jello and pineapple juice was excellent! The different colors did start to run together in the binding jello & whip cream after it sat out during dinner which didn't look too appetizing but overall it was tasty. I probably won't make this again as the prep involved is too much trouble. Thanks anyway! It looks like others enjoyed it much more than we did!",
