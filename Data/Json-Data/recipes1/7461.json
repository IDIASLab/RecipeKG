I made 1 batch with the recipe as described but found it sort of bland. So I made another but this time I sauteed the onion with some chili powder in the melted butter added a tablespoon of brown sugar replaced the celery seed and green pepper with a stalk of celery and swapped the lemon juice for lime juice. That was just the kick it needed! The second way only took about 5 minutes more. The basic sauce is definitely worth a try and lends itself well to some creativity!",

It might have been me b/c I added extra ingredients such as liquid smoke worcestershire sauce & a tiny bit of cajun seasoning. I slow cooked chicken in it all day and by the end the celery seed was way too overpowering you could even bite the seeds. Plus it was too ketchupy for me. I followed the recipe except for my add-ins. I ended up mixing in some store bought barbecue sauce just to try to tone down the strong celery taste. I want to try it again using less ketchup and maybe just a little celery salt instead.",
