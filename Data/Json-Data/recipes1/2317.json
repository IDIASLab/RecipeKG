I have to say that I highly recommend the use of cream cheese frosting (1 1/2 blocks cream cheese 10 tb. unsalted butter--both softened and 24 oz. powdered sugar splash of vanilla) AND plenty of chopped walnuts on the entire OUTSIDE of the 3-layer cake INSTEAD of in the batter! It looks and tastes amazing that way...judging by all the sneaky \"nut snatchers\" in the group =) I followed the recipe...except I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar for a lighter color and texture and I doubled the salt. All my ingredients were at room temperature and I creamed the sugars and butter until very light and fluffy (4-5 min?). The batter was light and the cake was not too heavy either. All said we highly recommend this cake =)",

It is delicious moist and perfect. Thank you Margaret. Addition -I have now made this cake about 15 times. Some may find batter thick and \"heavy\" because they are not sifting the cake flour enough. I sift three times. Also - last time I ran out of brown sugar so used 1 cup brown and 1 cup white. The result was a completely different flavor also fabulous. A light airy delicious cake. The riper the bananas the more banana flavor. Again Margaret Thank you thank you",

I used white sugar instead of brown since people found it to be heavy. I also used fat free sour cream and dusted the cake with confectioner's sugar.

I didn't have brown sugar so I used white sugar. I also used 3-1/2 c. all purpose flour and 3 bananas because that was all I had on hand. I wasn't fond of the frosting. Another reviewer said the recipe didn't make much frosting but I ended up with a huge bowl full of it. I took it to work and while most people liked the cake many commented the frosting was just too sweet. Next time I will use a cream cheese frosting.",

This is a very dense heavy cake & is okay but if you are looking for a \"light\" cake with plenty of banana flavor this is not for you. Many others said the brown sugar made it heavy and I REALLY packed the 2 cups of b.sugar very well. So that probably detracted from the banana flavor. I am sure if you follow other's advice to use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown- it would be better. Not worth the calories to me.",
