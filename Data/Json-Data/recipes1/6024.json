                "reviewBody": "LOL.  I was reading other reviews of this, and had to chuckle.  I grew up with knoephle soup -- it was considered to be a real treat, and a Dakota German delicacy. \r\n\r\nI, too, found the milk amount in the dumplings to be way too much.  I would use more like a 1/3 of a cup of milk to the two cups of flour.  Also, forget about cutting your dumplings -- that's more for noodles.  Just tear off small pieces of dough and drop them in.  Thumb-size pieces are traditional, but there's nothing wrong with a little bigger.  \r\n\r\nThe recipe is bland, but that's how it's supposed to be, really.  It's not a Cajun dish, for sure.  You can, however, spice it up with a little dill ground dill in your dumplings, a little more pepper, and by using chicken broth with herbs (the canned variety).\r\n\r\nThis soup is thick like a stew, oftentimes served as the main course.  Or with fried chicken and a vegetable side, where the soup serves as the potato course.",

My mom used to use a spoon and cut off a piece in the bowl and then dip the spoon with the dough on it into the hot soup and it will drop off. When the kneflas come back up to the top of the soup they are very close to being cooked. Knefla soup is still served in many restaurants in North Dakota.",

I added a little more celery & carrots used 6 cups of water with both chicken bullion and chicken soup base and dried onion flakes. I'm a novice at making the noodles but I took other reviewers advice and used 1/3 cup of milk to the 2 cups of flour and made small \"balls\" and dropped them into the soup rather than cutting strips...and I didn't use the entire mix either only apprx 3/4 of it. Finally while I was allowing the soup to cook I cooked some bacon crumbled it and added it when I added the evaporated milk. The \"knefla\" was slightly doughy/chewy yet despite cooking for the length of time required but I assume that is because I have no idea how it's suppossed to look feel size etc...Still I'm making this again because it was an impressive soup! Hopefully as I keep practicing the noodle or dumpling part of it will turn out right! Thanks Sue and your neighbor for sharing this delicious recipe with my family.",

It does come out slightly bland....needs at least a tsp of salt in my opinion though I don't want to offend any native Knefla makers. Also it could do with more than a single carrot and celery stalk. Also what are the Knefla pieces supposed to look like? (How big?) I rolled them into 3/4-cm strips and cut them at an inch but they ended up swelling into pieces much bigger than that.",

The only thing I changed was using buttermilk instead of regular milk in the knelpha ( needed to get rid of some) although I couldn't taste buttermilk it saved my regular for dinner:). I will definetly be making this again mayhaps next time I will add some chopped chicken breast too and make it the main course. Although I too agree that the servings are off I scaled down to 2 and ended up with more like 3 lg or 4 small servings then again I ended up wanting more than I thought I would too!
