This would have drowned in 6T of oil; I used about 2t. Also I used only half the lemon and zest and I juiced the pom because I don't like the texture of the seeds. I still needed to add some stevia to soften the bite of the lemon. I think this might have worked better with arugula instead of watercress but I don't plan to make it again. Thanks anyway.",
