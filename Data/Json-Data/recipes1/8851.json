I pureed this soup in batches so it would go down easy. After pureeing the whole batch I brought the soup up just under a slight boil and wisked in 1/4 cup of extra sharp white cheddar. My son and I loved it. NOTE: For you low-carb-eaters like me this is very low in calories and carbs. So....eat away!",
