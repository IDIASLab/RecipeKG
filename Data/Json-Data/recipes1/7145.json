I used pasturized egg substitute rather than the raw eggs which I was a little weary of using. I also cut the fat by using 2% and skim evaporated milk. I admit that the texture was a little on the grainy side because of this but not too bad. It also froze up in the freezer quite nicely. My boyfriend told me this ice cream was as good as his grandma's which is quite a complement! This one's a keeper!",
