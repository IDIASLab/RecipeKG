I could taste the mango in the thicker slices and they went so well with the cinnamon and nutmeg spices. I'm really happy with this recipe and how it turned out that I'm emailing this link to all of my friends. The only thing I changed was the cook time. I had to pull it out after 50mins to avoid burned edges and covered the edges with foil half way through as I saw the edges darkening quickly. I baked it in a glass dish so I dont know if that had something to do with it.",

I like it ok but I omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg since most reviewers said it made it taste like apple cobbler. This is very easy to cut into bars and I used 3 different kinds of mangoes. The sweeter riper ones came out muuuuuch better than the more tart one. If you have tart mangoes you can add honey instead of white sugar. Again it was ok tasting and I'm glad I tried it.",

                "reviewBody": "Though I am a health-conscious eater this is an amazing recipe. The shortbread bars are just so delicious and scrumptious. The 60 minute baking time is perfect for that slight golden brown crisp. However I used only 3.5 cups of mango (they were a little stringy but turned out great) only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and no nutmeg (I felt it was unnecessary because the cinnamon already spices the mango up). The most difficult part was slicing the mangoes. It took me about 1 hour to slice 4 medium-large mangoes and it was a really big mess. I sliced them pretty thin about 2-3 inches long and 0.5 inch wide. I was not familiar with baking shortbreads so while I mixed the flour butter and sugar together I thought the mixture was too dry and began to panic.. but turns out it was supposed to be crumbly and crispy. Make sure you firmly press the flour mixture on the pan and then evenly spread the mango mixture then just use your hands and make the flour mixture into crumbs and sprinkle it on top of the mango. Press down lightly. Next time I will try to substitute the butter for something else possibly half olive oil and half butter. Also because this shortbread reminds me of pie on Thanksgiving or Christmas I will try substituting the mango for pumpkin and bake it in a round dish see how that turns out:) I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe with us!",
