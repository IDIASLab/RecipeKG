I also used about 1/4 cup white wine. I love the idea of using the oil from the sundried tomatoes to saute the onions and garlic. I reduced the cheese to 1 cup and used asiago instead of parmesan  or mozzarella.  I will definetly make this again maybe adding some kalamata olives  or artichokes at the end. I think feta cheese would be really good too. I served it with grilled asparagus and marinated pork tenderloin.",
