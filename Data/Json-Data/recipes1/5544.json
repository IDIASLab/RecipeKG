Imagine my surprise when I found this recipe almost exactly as written in that cookbook! However the poster left out a step which is to parboil the potatoes already sliced (DM also recommend fingerling potatoes sliced in half if available) for 10 minutes before roasting with remaining veggies. At that point you cover with foil bake at 375 for 35 minutes then uncover and bake another 15. Might help some of you crunchy potato people out. Anyway if you enjoyed this I highly suggest the Madison cookbook mentioned. It is beyond phenomenal. I am not even a vegetarian and it is by far my favorite cookbook. And as a side note please never use dried cilantro or parsley as suggested by another reviewer. They have 0 flavor.",

Since there was less to \"process \" I was able to mix up the sauce without using a blender just using a garlic press and a fork to mix. I poured the sauce over the potato/veggie mixture and stirred it all up a bit. Instead of fresh tomatoes I used a 14.5 oz. can of diced ones. I only had idaho potatoes and they worked fine but I had to cook the dish for quite a bit longer. I didn't have red pepper so I used an orange one instead. I used pre-made lemon juice but probably only had the equiv. of half a lemon. I think the juice from the canned tomatoes evened out the liquid levels anyway. The end result was good. At first we weren't totally impressed but the second day after the sauce really had time to sink into the veggies it was definitely better. Next time I would add more cayenne and 1/2 a tbsp. less vinegar. Then I'd substitute the yellow pepper with zuchinni.",
