I put them in the day before and froze for 24 hours not totally meaning to... but did. So when I put in the food processor it froze all the sherbet to the melon...so I can laugh at this. Great way to make a supped up sorbet. But in order to fix my goof I increased the lime juice and sherbet...and by then the mix loosened up some so that it was soft. The kids down it all. It had a nice refreshing flavor and the kids were tickled. It did leave about a cup of the mix left so I stuck that back in the freezer for myself to have at a later time. Anyway...delish.",
