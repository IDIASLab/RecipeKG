        "description": "These gigantic sandwiches were invented a century ago at Sicilian Deli here in New Orleans. The spicy, tangy olive salad is what really sets this meat and cheese sandwich apart. A genuine muffuletta should be made on oven-fresh Italian bread topped with sesame seeds. Be sure and use the highest-quality ingredients available; it really makes a difference! Since you're going to all the trouble of making the olive salad, consider doubling the recipe so you'll have some extra waiting around for when you get another muffuletta craving -- it keeps for at least a month! Note: Use round bread loaves for real muffuletta.",

One hint make sure your olives are well drained and dried off with paper towels if you don't want the salad to taste too briny. This would be great to take on picnics or car trips as it can be made in advance and keeps well in the fridge otr a cooler. Thanks Boo!",
