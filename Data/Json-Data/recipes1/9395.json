I used the correct size pan and followed directions exactly--but it was totally runny and inedible. The outside crust was somewhat done and was delicious. I suggest baking until no longer runny and jiggly in the middle, because it does NOT firm up when refrigerated. Maybe 1+1/2 hr baking time. Otherwise easy to make.",
