This allows the bottom of the chicken crisp up as well.  I use chicken tenders.  I baked 15 minutes at 400, then broil for 5 minutes for extra crispness.  Instead of butter if you want to save calories is to add a capful of vinegar to some milk (it is a substitute for buttermilk).  This tenderizes the chicken as well and the coating sticks well to it. Then spritz with a light spray of oil and bake.  This recipe also works well with Panko or cornflake crumbs.  I've used this recipe to oven fry zucchini and mushrooms too.  A much more healthy alternative than deep fried and they actually taste better!  It's amazing how many calories you can save by using these simple steps.  Thanks for the great recipe!",

Used some of the left over crumbs sprinkled on top and drizzled whatever butter I had left over on top of the chicken. I used fresh grated parmesan and they came out wonderful!
