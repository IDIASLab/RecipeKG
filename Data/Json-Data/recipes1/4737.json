The chicken itself tasted fine and the sauce was good over rice but the bell pepper turned very sour and bitter as it soaked up the liquid. I usually mix a bit of water in with the lemon juice and wine so I think that's why I found the flavors too strong. Still I would NOT use a vegetable with its own strong flavor (like green bell pepper) for this recipe: try celery or potato instead and keep the bell pepper for fajitas or salad.",
