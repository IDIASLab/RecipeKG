I  did have a little trouble getting the dough to remain closed after putting in the filling. I think next time I will roll the dough out a little larger so I have more to work with on the closing. The filling is wonderfully creamy and sweet, very easy to make.\r\nThis cake was easy and pretty fast. It is very kid friendly, both in the making and eatting!\r\nGive it a try you'll like it!!",

I added 1/2 cup more of confectioners sugar and 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract. I thought filling needed these additions. Was rather blande without these things. I just used the lemon juice with my glaze ing. and not the milk. I didn't have a coffee can so I used my small stainless mixing bowl in center circle. It worked out good. My cake ring did crack in about 4 places(maybe too much filling.) I don't think I would double that next time. I thought the lemon juice was too strong in the glaze. Next time I will use a cheese mixture I use in my other kuchens and cut way back on the lemon juice in the glaze or use my regular glaze or canned frosting. We did like this. I hope to try the real thing next month. Thanks so much for sharing Arvilla!",

Ran right off of the COMPLETELY cooled cake and pooled in the middle. Not pretty & left virtually nothing for any sprinkles to stick to. Taste of the cake was good but will look for another frosting recipe.",
