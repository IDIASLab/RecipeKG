Instead of using 1 cup milk I increased it to 1-1/2 cup to make the mixture thinner. At first I feared one onion would be too much but after the pancakes were fried we tasted only a hint of onion - just enough to add some zest to the recipe. Thanks Ellen for sharing this recipe with AllRecipe readers. God bless you.",
