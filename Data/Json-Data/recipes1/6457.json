I mixed and baked according to direction with the exception of using only 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 1/8 cup. I do think they turned out how they are supposed to. I think I just like fluffier/cakier muffins. The texture of these was more like a cross between muffin and bread pudding. Very heavy. For a similar flavor profile in a more \"muffiny\" muffin I recommend the \"Morning Glory Muffins I\" from this site. A couple of neutral notes - these took a bit longer to bake in my oven than the recipes states. Also with a 6oz. ice cream scoop I got 15 standard-sized muffins.",
