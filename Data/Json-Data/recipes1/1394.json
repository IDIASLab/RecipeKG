The problem is I haven't been able to find the frosting mix and I understand that the original one made by Pillsbury is no longer available because all the frostings come in cans now. But no other recipe that I've tried for the tunnel of fudge cake compares to this one!",

For the frosting I used a dark chocolate frosting so I thought it'd be sting enough. I'm not sure what made the chocolate flavor not come out in the final product but next time I make this I'll use the right amount of sugar and add some cocoa powder as well. Also be sure that your eggs are up to room temp. I used mine right out of the fridge and it curdled the butter and made the batter look nasty and hard to work with:P other than my own mistakes this is a great cake recipe: it's dense and chewy and not too too dry but I'd recommend having this with vanilla (or chocolate) ice cream or some other type of topping. Used a chocolate coating instead of frosting and it was great but use frosting if possible.",
