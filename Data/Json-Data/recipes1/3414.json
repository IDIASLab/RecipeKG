I took the easy way out and used a good boxed chicken broth and some leftover rotisserie chicken. All I had to do was chop up the vegetables and throw them all in the broth along with the chicken pieces and soup pasta. Let it all simmer away and 15 minutes later it was ready to serve. I left out the carrots because I don't like them (and now that I'm a grown-up I don't have to eat them) but I would NOT recommend omitting the red pepper as that's what gives this soup its special flavor.

In doing so I think I proved that you can sub just about any vegetables and still come up with a wonderful soup. I didn t want to make 40 servings so I braised a chicken breast in chicken broth cooled and shredded it. I strained the broth and put it back in the pot. I added celery carrots mushrooms and more broth and simmered that for about ten minutes. I then added the shredded chicken red and yellow bell peppers and chopped green onions and simmered for another five minutes. I added a good amount of Cajun seasoning and some leftover cooked bow tie pasta and heated through. WOW! It was a delicious soup! I realize I didn t make this recipe and I m sure it would be delicious as written. But I did want to write this review to show others that substitutions can be made with equally good results. UPDATE 10/11/11 - I froze my leftovers and pulled one out for dinner last night. I was in a rush and didn't have already cooked pasta to throw in like I did the last time but I did have cooked rice so I used that. EXCELLENT again!",

All I had to do was heat up the low soduim chicken broth until it was boiling then add the local grown carrots zucchini yellow squash red bell pepper and mushrooms. For the celery I just used two small stalks with the leafy green tops and minced it up thinly and added it to the soup. I didn't have any onions but I added 1 piece of garlic clove. Once the vegetables started to cook up a bit I added a generous handful of the uncooked egg noodles. I seasoned the soup with fresh ground hawaiian sea salt and black pepper. I let the soup simmer for about 20 minutes until the noodles and vegetables were cooked. I had some fresh basil so I chopped up a little and sprinkled it on top last for color and flavoring. A very hearty fresh and flavorful soup this is! The soup has a light mild chicken taste which I like a lot. The carrots taste sweet and still has a slight give when I took a bite into it - nice! The zucchinis still retained a nice bright green color to it thou it was thinly sliced. All the fresh vegetables and herb makes this a 5 star for me. A pretty and \"healthy\" soup. It was perfect since my family woke up sick today. I also made \"Buttermilk Bread I \" from this website to serve along with this soup. (That bread is tasty by the way). I really enjoyed this soup. It was easy to make and it hit the spot with everyone.",
