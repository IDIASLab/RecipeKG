You don't fry the shell per say... you place it in the pan with oil for a short time until it's plyable and easy to fold.  I only had mine in for 7-10 seconds on each side.  Plus I added taco seasoning to the beef just like if you were making tacos... I don't think this would have had near enough flavor if I wouldn't have done that... it would have been bland, especially since the recipe doesn't call for any other spices, onions, or garlic.  But in the end, with some minor changes it turned out good and everyone liked it!   ",

Definately use corn tortillas (dipped in hot oil so they will roll without cracking) instead of flour.  I make the Red Enchilada Sauce recipe on this site.  What a difference homemade makes, and it takes just minutes.  Finally, add a packet of taco seasoning to the meat.  I think this recipe is waayy to bland without.  I even add a small pinch of crushed red pepper and a few diced tomatoes.  Top with sour cream, black olives and shredded lettuce for an authentic mexican enchilada!  Both my parents and my husband give two thumbs up on this recipe, as well.  THanks Donna :-)",

                "reviewBody": "This was a good basic recipe.  To create a more authentic taste, I used one onion, chopped small, and 6 cloves of garlic, shredded, and sweated those down with a little butter first.  I reserved that while the meat browned.  I added those two mixtures together and just enough canned red enchilada sauce to moisten the meat up real well...along with a little onion powder, granulated garlic, chili powder, mexican oregano, red pepper flakes, minced chilies (canned), and some spanish paprika.  After that simmered for a few minutes I assembled the enchiladas using corn tortillas.  Instead of using the red enchilada sauce solo on top, I used one can of that mixed with about a half a can of Wolf Brand chili (best if you heat that up to thin it out for easy spreading).  Then cheese was added to the top and baked.  I will tell you, this gave it such a great authentic flavor, like the chili-gravy you find in some good mexican restaurants.  Thanks for the head-start, now I just keep thinking of ways to rev it up and make it a little different each time.  I have a strickly meat-and-potatoes husband and 3 kids that are picky eaters...they ask for this at least once a week!  Ole!!",

You'll need a minimum of 3 cups of sauce for a 9 x 13 casserole dish for 6 enchiladas. Spread a layer of the sauce on the bottom of the dish before inserting the enchiladas to prevent them from sticking. Don't leave more than an inch of the ends of the enchiladas uncovered by sauce because exposed areas will become crispy.",

It is made with stuff on hand and beats the canned junk for taste. I also used only 1lb of turkey and had plenty. My 5 year-old devoured this (even though he thought there were too many yunions ) They only thing I think I will change the next time I make them (soon) will be to add maybe 1/4c of the red sauce to the meat mixture. I also used sharp cheddar but that is merely a personal preference.",
