When I read the ingredients of the pina colada mix our store carried, and saw that it consisted mostly of corn syrup and artificial flavorings, I opted to go the route of an authentic pina colada.  So, instead of the mix, I used 5 oz cream of coconut (Coco Lopez) and 5 oz of pineapple juice, instead of the mix.  I also used pineapple juice for the liquid in the cake mix recipe and added crushed pineapple, as per other reviewers here.  For the topping, I used real whipped cream as I personally just don't care for frozen whipped topping.  The consensus among my co-workers that I shared it with for a special Aloha-themed going away party was that it was delectable.",

Definitely cut back on the condensed milk and pina colada mix unless you really like it sweet. Also cream of coconut (not coconut milk) can replace pina colada mix.

If I make this again though I will make larger holes in the cake to let the pina colada mixture get into the cake. I poked holes in it with a meat fork but the mixture is so thick it didn't get down in the cake like I would have liked. I would use the handle of a wooden spoon to get larger holes in the cake but wait until it cooled just a little so your cake won't fall. I put about 1/4 c. of rum in the cake also and another 1/4 c. in the pina colada mix. Wonderful! I also put 1/2 tsp. of coconut flavoring in the whipped cream. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and put in a 20 oz crushed pineapple in the cake also. I drained it and used the juice in the cake for part of the water and then folded in 1/2 of the pineapple in the cake. I put the other drained 1/2 of can on top of the pina colada mixture on top of the cake. It was so nice and moist. Make sure that you refrigerate the cake at all times except when serving. My cake started to slip off the side after it sat out for a while but it didn't make any difference to anybody as they enjoyed it so much. I baked this in a round 10\" spring pan and it came out of the pan nicely. This made such a pretty presentation. I used purple silk flowers on the side of it with a little red hat in the middle of the cake. Just a fun dessert and the rum made it so good.",
