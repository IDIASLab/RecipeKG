When done you can fit them together with icing 'glue' and paint them with colored icing.  First decide what size and draw each piece (front, back, ends and roof on paper such as typing or computer paper and fit them together to see how it will look when completed.  You can also cut out shingles and 'glue' them in place after the rest is assembled.  Use the paper pattern as a guide for cutting each piece out of the dough before you bake it. Decorate with icing and decorative candies.",

The dough baked well and looked promising. The next day however when putting the roof together the pieces broke into half! I had to use icing to glue them back. It was just too fragile and soft for making a house. But to be fair the recipe does say 'shoe box size house'. It must be a very small one. In that case I don't think the pieces would have broke. Also this is not for eating - doesn't really taste that good.",

My family has used the same recipe for the past 35 years and my mother has become a convert since switching to this recipe. I was able to make 25 medium sized houses last year with no problems. the dough was easy to work with and rolled out to an even smooth texture. The one trick to remember when working with any gingerbread recipe is to bake it long enough (dark golden brown and firm to the touch) and allow the gingerbread to sit at room temperature for at least a day. This allows the gingerbread to fully solidify making it much easier to handle. The shortening in this recipe makes the gingerbread very firm and smooth unlike recipes that call for oil. Overall a great recipe for house construction.",
