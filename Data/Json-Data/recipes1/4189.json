I cooked some sliced baby ports. and diced onions in the bacon fat. I whisked in about 3 TBL of butter into the drippings.  I  whipped about 1/2  cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup grated parm into the 1 egg and 3 egg yolks.   Tossed the pasta into that  and then threw it into the pan for a minute or two and kept it moving.
