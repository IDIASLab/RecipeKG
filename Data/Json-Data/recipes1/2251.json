The only change I made was to use orange zest instead of tangerine. I ran into one slight issue with the recipe: after I pressed the juice out of the pineapple and added back 3/4 cup my batter was incredibly dry. I ended up adding almost all of the juice back into the mixture (at least 1/4 cup extra.) This may have been my fault because I REALLY pressed the juice out of that pineapple. Could be that some canned pineapple has more juice than others too. The bread baked perfectly in 60 minutes filling my house with the most delicious smell! I cheated and cut it while it was still a little warm. It was so good- almost dessert-like. The next time I think I will just add the whole can of pineapple juice and all as I only had about 1 TBSP of juice left. Thanks for a delicious recipe!",

I didn't have a can of crushed pineapple but did have 3 cans of pineapple rings. I crushed one of those and used the entire can and all of the juice. The bread wasn't the least bit dry nor was it 'wet'. The flavor was good but it just didn't pop. Toasted it helped bring out the flavor. This recipe made 5 (6 x 3 1/2) mini loaf pans. I baked it for 34 minutes.",

To make up for that I added a small very ripe mashed banana. I'm a retired pastry chef/sous chef and have baked a LOT. I think that this would be very good made with cream of coconut subbed for part of the butter. It's a nice recipe that would have been better as written with the full amount of pineapple instead of the banana but was still a tasty basic muffin that my grandchildren enjoyed warm at the foot of the sledding hill at 11F!
