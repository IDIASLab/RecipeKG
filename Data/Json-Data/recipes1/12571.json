Because of the fresh garlic, I omitted the garlic powder.  I used half crab, half shrimp (the tiny shrimp in a can) - a great combo!  I used tilapia because I couldn't get sole, and it was delish.  I think any flat white mild fish would be fine.  I actually did not sprinkle with lemon or parm because instead I used the lemon-butter-garlic sauce from the \"Sole in Butter Sauce\" on this website - I poured a thin layer of the sauce into the baking dish, put the fish roll-ups on top, and then drizzled with more sauce.  It tasted heavenly, but I found that the stuffing was a little mushy in the middle.  Next time I might try laying the fish in the pan FLAT, and then spreading the stuffing on top instead of rolling it up.  I will make this again.",
