I also made several alterations which resulted in the best veggie chili I've ever made!  I didn't add the italian spices, using only salt and a lot of chili powder.  I added two onions instead of one, added one package of Yves Veggie Ground Round (a soy fake ground beef like product), used one red, one yellow, and one green pepper (not to mention the six jalepenos), two diced portabella mushrooms, and since I wasn't sure if the canned tomatoes were diced or pureed, added a 28 oz can of each.  It was fantastic!!!",

As others have said it was delicious and so so easy. Since we like spicy food I did change the spices. Rather than the spices from the recipe I put in 3 Tbsp. chili powder 2 Tbsp cumin 2 tsp cayenne pepper 1 Tbsp salt and a few grinds of black pepper. My tomatoes weren't in puree so I added one can of tomato paste to thicken it a little and I used black beans rather than black bean soup. I cooked it for about 3 hours in the slow cooker. This is one that I will make again and again! Thanks!",
