First of all I cooked in the oven as suggested and it needed to cook A LOT longer than 15-20 minutes. I ended up cooking it at 400 for 20 minutes and then turning the oven up to 425 for 20 more minutes. The marinade was also too thin and didn't coat the meat like I thought it would. The cumin was a bit too much as well. I doubt I will make again.",

We marinated chicken breasts which were cut into thirds. I'll make this again as it really stands out with its blend of flavors.",
