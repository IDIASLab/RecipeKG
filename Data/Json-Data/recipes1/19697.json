You need to keep in mind that aside from the 2 cups of chicken broth, you are adding 1 can of green chiles, which adds to the liquid to rice ratio. I made this with all the ingredients except I added and extra 1/2 cup of rice to absorb the extra liquids and it was perfect!  of course, if you like sticky rice, then leave the recipe as is.",

The rice did turn out kinda sticky and mushy, and I even rinsed my rice before I started (something I always do to get rid of starch).  I think the added moisture from the chilies contributed to the wetness of the rice, and I had even removed excess liquid from chilies.  If I make this again, I'll definitely cut back on the chicken broth (probably use 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cups instead of 2) and cook for less time (15 mins or so). An easy way to kick up plain rice!",
