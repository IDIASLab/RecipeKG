I left out the almonds, but added a little almond extract, and used cool whip and left out the sugar.

Very delicious salad, this will be a new staple!",

I used cold leftover Jasmine rice (from last nights dinner when I make rice I always make extra to store for future meals) I did not have peaches so I used an apricot I also subbed regular raisins for golden raisins. The biggest thing I changed was using Almond milk instead of heavy cream I used raw sugar instead of white. The almond milk did not thicken as heavy cream would have so I just added extra rice. I made a bed of Artisan lettuce spooned some rice salad on top and topped with pine nuts instead of more almonds. Delicious!!",
