I rolled out the dough paper thin.. and then i placed a bowl on top and cut around the bowl... so all of my tortillas were the same perfect circles.  Tortillas came out soft and tasty! They look store-bought, but taste much better! I have made them many many times and everyone always loves them.",

I made Bacon 'n' Egg Wraps with the tortillas and my husband was amazed at the ease and speed of making such a wonderful breakfast. ***MODIFICATION*** I substituted the shortening with equal amounts of butter. Tortilla recipe would make 6 servings. ***UPDATE*** To make tortilla bowls for taco salad, I placed uncooked tortillas on top of a ball of aluminum foil. Make sure you spray the ball with PAM so it doesn't stick. Cook for 400 degrees for about 10-15 minutes, depending how big the tortillas are. This makes healthier non-fried bowls. ",

It is low in fat but tastes great!  It is easy to make and if you let it rest at least 1 hour it rolls out thin and holds together like the ones you buy at the store.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used very hot water and was careful to not overcook them.  That is very important to be sure they are soft enough to fold.  It only takes about 10-15 seconds per side.  I also like 10-12 inch tortillas so I only made 7 out of the recipe so they would be big enough for soft tacos for my teen age boys.  \nWith the price of store tortillas going up so much this is a great way to go!",

They rolled out nicely and really thin. Didn't need much bench four but it's a dry day out today. Foe those of you having trouble rolling them out. You need to really let them rest. Flour has a lot of gluten and when you mix it the gluten strands get tight. That is why should also take care not to over knead the dough either. Let it rest for at least 20 min. before rolling and another 20 min. before cooking. This will give you a great tortilla. I usually roll them early in the day and cook them up right before eating.

And actualy, I like store bought tortillas. My mom always bought tortillas from the grocery store, I've always bought tortillas from the grocery store, and my 3-year old son loves to snack on a good old Mission-brand tortilla plain. Recently we moved to Switzerland and store bought tortillas are about $6 or $7 for a bag of 5! I was looking for a recipe in hopes that they wouldn't be too different than the store bought tortillas I have grown up on. These are perfect, sure I made my adjustments (more fat, mmm)and they ended up looking more like ameobas than circles. But they were great and close to store bought, just a little better. My son still loves to snack on these plain and we can do everything we did with the good ole' mission brand.       ",
