I followed the recipe to a tee except I baked from 8-10 min at 350 per prior reviews. I found it easiest to \"plop\" all of the vanilla cookie dough on the sheet first because it was a little more wet. Then I plopped the choc cookie dough beside and and molded the seams. Thanks for a great cookie recipe! UPDATE Still AMAZING! I froze half and thawed a week later for a family get together and they will as delicious as they were fresh. This is my new \"go to\" cookie recipe. UPDATE #2 I just made these again and wanted to add the recipe as is made 42 \"half & half\" cookies 6 all chocolate (umm I ate some of the \"white\" dough:)). I figured out what's so great about the consistency too...they don't fall! They stay exactly the same as when you take them out of the oven.",

I like using 1/8t of baking powder in each batter b/c it allows you to shape it to the thickness you want because when it bakes it will not flatten much at all but stay how you want. Great way to ensure your cookies won't go flat! Also I take my smallest scooper and drop one on the cookie sheet then combine the FLAT/BOTTOM sides together. Easiest way to mold the two together. If you use the baking sheet as your surface then FLIP the cookie over...the side that was touching the sheet will be nice and smooth. Definitely raise your temp to 350. What's nice about this recipe is each cookie cooks at the exact same consistency so one side never turns out flatter or overcooked!",

The reg chocolate chip part I did 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/2 tsp baking powder 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup softened butter. The chocolate choc chip I did 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. The rest I left the same and did semi-sweet choc chips in both. Absolutely delicous and nice and big and puffy. I always add in baking powder to my cookies to guarantee they wont flatten. I think it is easier to drop the choc chip scoops directly onto the baking sheet then drop the choc choc chip scoop right next to it and gently mold it together with your hands. AWESOME!",
