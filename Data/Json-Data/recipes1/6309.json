I added a little onion and left out the water chestnuts. The unusual dressing was really the thing that was supposed to give the typical bean salad a lift over the vinegar oil and sugar type. I wasn t impressed. It just tasted like French dressing with some salsa mixed in it and not something unique unto itself. I did try some sliced almonds. Maybe mine were old but If I do make this again I would totally leave the almonds out did nothing for it. It may be better the second day too. Good starter idea to use salad dressing on the beans though maybe I ll try Ranch with the salsa next time.",
