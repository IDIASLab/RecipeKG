The caramel was very hard to manipulate as it was so sticky and there should be some note as to the best way to melt them (mine started burning). It was also hard to spread the caramel over the dough and then when it was chilled it was very hard to cut the bars. Also they didn't hold together well when I tried to dip them into the chocolate. I may not have let the dough chill long enough but overall I found this recipe difficult and not really worth it.",
