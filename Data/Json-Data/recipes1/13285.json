I actually used about 1/8 the batter per wrapper (not 1/4), but doubled the recipe so I could throw out ones  I ripped.  They ended up being 5-6\" by 5-6\" (I tried to make them square-ish so they'd be easier to wrap).  Be careful not to over cook them - the bottom side should be barely, barely golden, the top just barely not wet.  Let them cool for a minute before wrapping, or they tear.  Don't let them go too long, though, or they crack.  DO NOT OVER FILL!  Each wrapper makes one egg roll appx. the length of your thumb and 2-3 times the size.  Good luck!",
