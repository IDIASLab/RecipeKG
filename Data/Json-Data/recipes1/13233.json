However, I think I have got some really great alterations. \r\nFill the bottom of the pan with enough water to cover, mix in about a Tbsp. of cornstarch, a tsp. and a half of vanilla, and a small handful of chopped nuts. (Almonds, walnuts, or pecans.)\r\nCore apples all the way through (I used Jonathan apples) and peel a thin ring of skin off around the middle of each apple so they can \"breathe\". Stuff apples with the brown sugar and butter premixed, and place apples in water mixture. Sprinkle apples and water with nutmeg and a generous (but not overpowering) amount of cinnamon. \r\nBake at 350 for 20 min. covered with foil and then for another 10 min. uncovered. \r\nFinally, serve in bowl with the caramel/nut sauce around base of each apple. Vanilla ice cream in the center drizzled with caramel ice cream topping is another incredible addition to them.\r\nI hope this helps but after these alterations, the recipe was to die for. Seriously, just skip to these suggestions and you'll have the perfect recipe. I'm not usually this confident, but with this, I can't help it!",

I'll definately try the recipe again but won't microwave the b. sugar & butter first & I'd bake it a lot longer. Will let you know how it turns out. :-)\r\n\r\nOh oh oh, also, I added 10+ raisins that had been soaked in the middle of the apple as well and those were yummy.",
