I used a tsp of pumpkin pie spice for the spices and used 1/2 c of evaporated milk for the cream.  Although I'm sure fresh is better, this soup turned out very tasty!! And for 140 calories and 6 grams of fat per serving, was quite healthy too.  Will definitely make again.",

We used this as a main dish, and therefore DOUBLED the recipe to serve 7 people, which only gave us about 2 leftover servings. Considering the amount of time it took to prep, I'm glad we did that -- I wouldn't have wanted to prep this twice in one day! Some tips: we sliced up the pumpkin and cut out the seeds, then boiled it in water for about 15 minutes to soften it up, making it much easier to pare the skin from the flesh. Because we doubled the recipe, we had to saute the veggies in batches before throwing them all together with the remaining ingredients in our large stockpot. Kid-friendly: 4 stars (if your kids don't like pumpkin or sweet potato to start with, they probably won't like this.) Easiness: 5 stars (it IS easy to make), but quickness, 2 stars -- takes long time to prep! Overall, 5 stars -- it tasted WONDERFUL, and the rave reviews from my parents, husband, and kids made it all worthwhile.",

These were my alterations: I can't eat much dairy so like I do for all cream soups I omitted the cream and it was still wonderful (and MUCH healthier.) I baked the butternut squash instead of trying to peel it and added it later than the raw vegetables. Also I don't like the spicy flavors of nutmeg and cloves and didn't have any of the other spices on hand anyway. I ended up adding a little ginger and thyme and tons of black pepper. I loved that the flavors in the soup can really stand on their own without the spices and cream. This is the best squash soup I've ever made!",
