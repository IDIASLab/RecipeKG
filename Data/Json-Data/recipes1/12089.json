There is too much peanut butter for the amount of other ingredients, so...either add less PB or more of everything else. We just added more of the other ingredients to taste. Extra vinegar and brown sugar (which we used in place of white sugar) was the perfect touch here, as it helps take the place of hoisin sauce. \n\nMy husband used to cook in a high-end restaurant and was skeptical about a hoisin-free peanut sauce, but was very surprised with how good this turned out with our modifications. A few sesame seeds and some green onion on top and it was perfect. (We had it with chicken satay.)",

I used both to come up with my 1/2 cup and heated up the water to get the rest of the peanut butter out of the container. Since the peanut butter I have is pretty sweet I skipped the sugar. I didn't have hot sauce so I substituted 1/2-1 tsp. of cayanne pepper instead. I am a fan of garlic so I used two cloves and added 1 tsp. powdered ginger and 1 1/2 Tbls. lemon juice. It was all very easy to put together and the previous reviews made it simple to personalize. The only thing that would have made it any better is if the seal hadn't given out on the food processor attachment to my blender! My hard-to-please Filipino hosts loved it.",
