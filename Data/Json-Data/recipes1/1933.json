I really liked this pie and so did my kids. My husband said it was too creamy. He likes traditional cheese cake. He said it was good though. I will definately keep this recipe on hand for that last minute dessert. I only refrigerated the pie an hour and it was set just fine. The only thing I would do different next time is make my own crust. I like easy recipes and because of the ease and flavor of this one I give it 5 stars.",

I think it was because I used supermarket vanilla and not my usual \"good' vanilla. So I will cut back to a tsp or omit if I don't have the good stuff. It still got eaten no leftovers so maybe it was just me.... I've made this many times since I first got the recipe. I love it as a quick & easy dessert. I don't pretend it's cheesecake. It's cheesecake pie. I do add an extra 3 oz pkg of cream cheese to the mix and a bit more lemon juice. I sometimes get a premium (lots more stuff) cherry or blueberry pie filling and top it with that. It's an easy go to recipe.Update: made this again for xmas and for some unknown reason it did not set up. stayed slightly runny which wasn't very appealing tho it still tasted good. Lowfat cream cheese? too much lemon juice? any ideas what went wrong?",
