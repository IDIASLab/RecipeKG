I only used 1 cup of apple juice eliminted the red dye doubled the vanilla extract and used half of a small bag of red hots. It turned out good. The cinammon flavor was right on and it wasn't mushy at all. I sprinkled the top with a little powdered sugar and cinammon and a dallop of cool whip. You must love the taste of cinnamon to love this recipe. Overall it was good but because my family isn't a huge fan of cinnamon I will only be making it for myself next time!:)",

I remove from heat before the apples are tender because they have to sit to cool and will continue to soften I like the other reviewer don't want a mush pie. I'm sure you could also use the Lorans (tm) candy flavorings for the cinnamon flavor. I made mine a nice red with gel foodcoloring. This pie is AWESOME if I remember to take a pic I will submit it. I Serve it with whipped cream from the can.. TAS-TEE!!!!!",
