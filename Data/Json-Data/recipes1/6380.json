The ingredients are so simple and plain yet it makes a nice quick-like-bread that isn't sticky (noted too by another reviewer) yet so much lighter... it is almost like cake without being sugary sweet. The outside gets a soft golden crust while the inside bakes up light and tender. The slight hint of anise is pleasant. After it cooled to room temp I drizzled the Vanilla Glaze by Jamie Langston from this site over the top and had it for a light dessert after dinner with coffee. Excellant with the glaze! This recipe is a keeper and great if you don't like sugary sweet. Be careful not to overcook or it will become \"dryer\". The next morning after refridgeration it became firmer but still was delicious.",

It's kind of unassuming but I think that's what I like about it. The anise flavor is not strong unless you happen to bite down on one of the seeds. I suppose if you wanted a strong anise flavor you could try crushing the seeds to release the aroma. A friend suggested that it wants some kind of topping but myself I think it's good as is. Great with hot tea. Will definitely be making this again. Thank you.",

The main photo is spot on what this looks like. Maybe it's not the classic version of pound cake and its list of ingredients but I could not tell the difference. There is nothing bread about this except it is in a loaf pan. I might say this is a slightly dense pound cake at most. It is sweet and I was not sure what to do with it. Only change I made was subbing 1/4 tsp. of vanilla extract for the anise seeds. Just not a fan of that flavoring. Since I just bought a package of strawberries it will I suppose be turned into strawberry shortcake.",
