I took the mushroom stems and chopped them finely, then only took about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of stovetop stuffing (I had a can of it, so that made it easier...plus I put it in a baggie and crushed it a little finer)  I fried up the chopped stems in a little margarine, then added the crushed stuffing mix, then added a couple of shakes of parmesan cheese.  The liquid from the cream of mushroom soup is enough to make the stuffing 'stick', and these came out fantastic.",

I have family members that are allergic to seafood so that's why I first made these instead of crab stuffed ones, and there sure aren't ever any complaints. The ingredients are cheap too! I'm sure I'll be making them for Christmas this year too, thanks for the recipe :)",
