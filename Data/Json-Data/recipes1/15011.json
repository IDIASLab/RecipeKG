I then increased the black pepper to 1/2 teaspoon and added 2 tablespoons of hot sauce 3/4 teaspoon of ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon of salt 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne and 1/4 teaspoon of oregano. DELICIOUS. I guess the reason for all those garnishes was to provide the chili with taste. With my changes no need for the extra calories.",
