Broth is so much better when made with rotesserie ckn. Pretty much followed the recipe & added trimmings at the end.  Great way to use up rotisserie ckn & get a bigger bang for your buck. Your only expense is the price of the veggies & if you're like me you have them in the fridge anyways. A pot of soup for no extra cost!  If I'm not going to serve right away I cook the noodles separate.  If they're left in overnite they tend to swell & absorb the broth.  So I just toss them in when I'm reheating the soup.",
