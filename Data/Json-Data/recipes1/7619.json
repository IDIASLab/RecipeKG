Here's what I did:  Left butter at 1/2 cup and increased flour to 1/2 cup.  I also added chopped onions for more flavor, sauteeing them before adding the flour.  When I added the 1 pt of half and half and the 1 pt of cream, I brought these to a slow boil before adding the sugar, salt and corn.  It did thicken up nicely.  Instead of 2 16 oz bags of frozen corn, I used 3 as I was making for family Christmas dinner.  It was fantastic and I got lots of compliments!",

What we changed was this: Decreased butter to 2 Tbls to match the amount of flour and added 1/2 chopped onion to the butter cooking until translucent to add some flavor before blending in the flour. Next we replaced the heavy cream with whole milk and only used 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1 1/2 cups of half n half. We reduced the sugar to 1 Tbls. and added about 1 1/2 Tbls of fresh gound black pepper. Used same amount of corn cheese and salt. Once the mixture was bubbly we cooked it for about 20 minutes then turned off and when cooled stored in the fridge in a covered buttered casserole dish until the party (2 days later). Day of party we brought the casserole to room temp in microwave sprinkled some cracker crumbs (about 1/2 cup) mixed with melted butter (about 1 Tbls) over and baked at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes until bubbly. Turned out really good.",

After spending a good half-hour hoping it would reduce significantly I finally ended up taking ladle-fulls of liquid out. I think it needs about 1/3 a pint of half & half and cream each. That's it. Once I got rid of the excess liquid though...mmmmmmmmarvelous!",
