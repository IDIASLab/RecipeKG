I saw no need to peel the zucchini, and as a result it was not mushy, but nice and crisp. The unpeeled zucchini also gave great color to the dish! I cooked the rice separately. I brought a 15 oz. can of Swanson's 97% chicken broth and added enough water to make two cups of liquid. To the 2 cups of boiling liquid I added a tsp. salt, and one cup of long grain rice and cooked the rice until it was just tender. After the vegetables finish cooking I combined them with the hot cooked rice. Then as a finishing touch, I added 3/4 cup of Monterey Jack(suggestion of a previous Reviewer).  I've cooked \"Zucchini Saute\" twice to raving reviews.  It's a very tasty dish!",
