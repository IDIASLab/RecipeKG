I'm hoping to boost that, as this recipe is simply underrated.  I disagree with the few reviewers who found these \"tasteless\" and/or \"cake-like\" and if they had to be thrown out I respectfully suggest the baker must have done something wrong. There are a few types of sugar cookies - chewy, soft, firm, light, crispy, tender - and the list goes on. These are light as air, tender and crispy, which cream of tartar always seems to contribute. The flavor is subtle, perfect for embellishing with frosting, decorating sugars, chocolate glazes, cherries, rolling in cinnamon-sugar or whatever else you fancy.  Just as good plain, too, when you don't want something overwhelmingly sweet. This was a nice dough to work with, easy to mix up, and I had them in and out of the oven in just minutes. I decorated them for Christmas by rolling them in green and red decorator sugars before flattening them slightly. There is everything to like about this cookie!",

She told me her best friend gave her the recipe 45 years ago. Her recipe even has the same name Tender Crisp Sugar Cookies. Depending upon how you bake these they turn out differently. I have rolled them out thick with a short cooking time and they turn out very soft and stay soft and are great with icing. I have just used them as a drop cookie or my mom likes to roll them out thin to make them crispy and then frost or sugar them. My husband likes them when I roll them into balls then press them slightly with a glass and when they are fresh out of the oven I sprinkle them with sugar. I like them with chocolate icing. My crazy son likes them best when I make them with less flour (he calls them sugar cookies made wrong because I accidently left out TWO cups of flour once) they really spread when baking but turned out chewy and good. This is an all time favorite that can be eaten plain sugared or iced dropped rolled out or rolled into a ball. Love them.",

I dipped the cookies in red sugar crystals and 22 first graders 2 teachers my 4-year old and my husband wolfed them down and asked for more. For others who tried the recipe and were disappointed in the taste I wonder if perhaps they are used to rolled soft/chewy sugar cookies or those made with lemon extract. As for the comment that they \"taste about like the sugar cookies you can buy from Walmart with the frosting on them \" I would have to disagree. This is a basic sugar cookie recipe that tastes great with coffee cocoa etc. The only trouble I had was with the dough being a bit soft but I'm sure that was my fault because I was mixing too vigorously and lost a bit of the flour mixture at one point. I just sprinkled a bit of flour over the mixture worked it in and it was fine. Still too soft? Refrigerate for 10 minutes for a more cohesive dough that is still easily shaped. I'll use this recipe again.",
