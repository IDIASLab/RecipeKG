Here is what I did - \nI boiled the chicken in a little water with a garlic clove and salt until done.  I let the chicken cool until I could handle it and I shredded the chicken by hand (PERFECT in this soup).\n\nIn the soup pot, I sauted the onion until tender, added the chicken and spices and then added the rest. A REALLY good salsa to use that won't make it too tomato-y is a small can of \"Embassa\" salsa.  This can be found in the international isle of your grocery store.  It has a more fresh tomato taste than your normal jar of salsa and it's probably a quarter of the price - $1!\n\nI boiled the soup for about 15 minutes and I think the thing that really finished this soup and made it more of a meal - I cooked some minute rice on the side and let people add as much or as little to their soup as they liked. I also added about a 1/2 can of drained and rinsed black beans. This gave the soup a little more substance.  Also - I used a LOT more chicken broth than the recipe suggested - a 48oz can of low sodium chicken broth, as well as 3/4 of a box (the resealable). I don't know if the broth would have been enough if I had followed the recipe.",

Right before we ate it, he just took the chicken breasts out, shredded them up, and put them back in.  Great flavor for such easy preparation.  My recommendation is to use good chicken broth like Pacific or Imagine brand, and pepper jack cheese on top.  This is a great way to use up stale tortilla chips.",

I use a medium spicy corn and black bean salsa, and add diced bell or poblano peppers to the saute.  We then add a can of black beans and some cilantro to a double recipe. Instead of purchased chips, I use regular corn tortillas, cut them in half, then cut into narrow strips.  Spray with a little cooking spray, add salt to taste and bake in the oven until crisp.  They look and taste great on top of the soup. ",

Also, it never said what to do with the chicken after it was sauteed.  So after the soup simmered awhile, I took it out, sliced it, and added it back.  Personally, I think sauteed chicken is not as tender as poached.  Next time, I will poach the chicken in the broth and shred it before making the rest of the soup.  I will also sautee the onions beforehand so they're not so crunchy.  Maybe add a little less salsa, as a whole cup was a bit overpowering.  Definitely replace lime juice for the lemon.  I've seen restaurants that serve lime wedges with tortilla soup.  It's more \"Mexican tasting\" to me.",
