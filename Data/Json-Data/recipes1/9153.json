I cooked (and subsequently refrigerated) my tortellini separately so we could have leftovers sans dissolved tortellini. I also noticed that the broth in the recipe's one picture looks kind of creamy so I added some instant mashed potato flakes to thicken it up (about 1 cup). I'm sure the soup is great as is but it turned out really well this way too and I plan to use the potato flakes again in the future because it gave it some good substance. The only thing I will change is to use a pinch of cayenne pepper instead of the pepper flakes because while we enjoyed the slight spiciness the pepper flakes made us cough some. It's true that the flavors of the soup are not complicated but we thought everything went very well together and it's too easy not to make again.",
