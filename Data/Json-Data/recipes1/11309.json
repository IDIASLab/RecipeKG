I used the fat free white chocolate instant pudding but used 2% milk in making the pudding. Use the amount of milk that the box suggests.  I also used 3 boxes of the pudding - 2 with the coffee ingredient and 1 without, which I used as the middle filling. (If you can find my picutre I submitted with my trifle bowl you can see how nice it turned out.  I made the whipping cream and used a layer on the top.  Adding the extra pkg of pudding layer and a top layer of whipping cream you do not have to double the recipe.  Also I drizzled Hersheys Syrup over each brownie layer (3 layers). So the layers went like this: Bottom layer -thin layer of whipping cream, brownie layer, syrup, toffe pieces, white chocolate coffee pudding/whipping cream mixture, brownie layer, syrup, toffee pieces, white chocolate pudding/cream mixture (remember no coffee in this batch), brownie layer, syrup, toffee pieces, coffee pudding mixture, a nice layer of whipping cream, last Skorr bar pieces and syrup drizzled over the top.  It is beautiful to look at too. Delicious and thanks for offering the recipe of this scrumptuous treat!!!",

Is there a mistake in the amount of milk? 1-3/4 c. of milk to 2 boxes of pudding is not nearly enough. Even had trouble putting it together it is so thick. Very very diappointed but am sure it is because of a mistake in the recipe. Has anyone else had this problem. I will serve it anyway but have to add some sort of topping or chocolate sauce. Sorry for the negative comments. I am certainly not a novice cook.",

I made a couple of changes by substituting a devil's food cake mix for brownies and after the cake cooled I lightly damped it with some Kalua. The rest was done according to the recipe and it was delicious! The recipe doesn't make enough whip topping but next time I'll just double the pudding cool whip mixture. Great recipe.
