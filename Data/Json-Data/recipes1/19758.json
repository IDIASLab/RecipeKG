I cooked on low, checked the crockpot at 2 hours, the chicken was cooked and tender, so I removed it from the crockpot and proceeded with thickening the sauce.  The sauce was not thickened after 20 minutes, so I added a bit more cornstarch and finished it on the stovetop.  I also added a little crushed red pepper flakes and a good squeeze of Sriracha sauce to kick up the heat just a bit.  Finally, quickly saut\u00e9ed some veggies and stirred in at the end.  I'm not a huge fan of crock pot cooking, but this turned out pretty well, it certainly is easy, and keeps me out of the kitchen on this hot summer day.",
