Over the years (almost 50) I lost this recipe so it was great to find this one.  I changed the sugar to 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white and chilled in the freezer for a couple of hours.  They don't have to be exactly round--the shape gives them a little character.  They taste good and look just darling!  Thanks again!",

I cut the recipe in half and within a few hours half of the cookies were gone (my boyfriend and I can't get enough of them). One tip: Don't preheat the oven as step 1 the dough has to chill for 2 hours what a waste of energy. Will be making these many times over.",

Original recipe uses margarine not butter and used 1 1/2 squares bittersweet choc. melted with 1/2 tsp soda added to the chocolate. I've learned to roll the lighter dough around two chocolate logs to form a single oval shaped dough log to chill. This way they don't break in two so easily. My favorite thing about them: when they bake they all take on different personalities!!!",
