I left out the peanuts and used 1 cup raisins and 1 cup dried cranberries. I have made this with thin pretzel sticks instead of chow mien noodles. (For passover - I made this with matzo farfelle). I made two logs and once they set (30 minutes in the freezer) I cut them into biscotti-like slices. Amazing!!!! My family loves to eat these straight from the freezer!",

I didn't have chow mein noodles or butterscotch chips. I made individual drop cookies but I think making a log or flat tray full then cutting it into portions would be just as easy and give more uniform sizes to all the cookies. My chocolate was a little too warm though and some of the marshmallows started to melt just barely so the chocolate needs to be as cool as possible while still being melty enough to work with. Great little easy recipe thanks for posting it.",
