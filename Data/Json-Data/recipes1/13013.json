It's more smoothie-like to me but I still think it's good. I've played around with this recipe and found that the best variation for our tastes is: 2 bananas (we love 'em in this family) 1 cup milk 1 cup yogurt and 4 TBSP sugar. It is perfectly sweet and tart- like a banana smoothie/shake should be. I omitted the lemon juice simply because I was out haha. Anyways I think it's a great recipe that can be varied using whatever fruit you happen to love and still be completely tasty and good for you! 5 stars from me and my family!:)",
