                "reviewBody": "I was intrigued by all the positive feedback on this recipe. It WAS excellent. I took in some of the suggestions: I cut the salt to 1 tsp, I let the bread rise on my parchment covered stoneware sheet, I did brush the top with the egg wash and I did cut the bread lengthwise. I didn't have any cornmeal so I skipped that. The parchment prevented any sticking. I also put the pan of ice cubes in the bottom while baking. I used all bread flour and it was fine. I may try it in a loaf (in a loaf pan) and use the half bread flour/half AP flour option and see how that turns out. Has anyone ever tried this in a loaf pan?\n\nThe crust is superb; nice and chewy and the middle was nice and soft. I did let the bread rise about ten minutes longer than the recipe called for, as it looked a bit on the skinny side at 40 minutes. \n\nI am a microbiologist by trade. Yeasts are living organisms. They respond to moisture and, more importantly, temperature. If it's cold, your yeast just isn't going to rise as fast as you'd like. There is an optimum temperature for all microorganisms. Since we work with human pathogens, and not commercial food organisms, I don't know the exact range that this would be. I do know that the extra ten minutes made all the difference in the rising for this bread.",

We go to a little local Italian shop where they make fresh bread and it is amazing, this recipe came very close to it. I have been on a bread making kick for the past 2 years and have all kinds of bread making books one even from Le Cordon Bleu and this recipe ranks right up there. The crust was chewy and golden, this bread is little dense but delicious, a perfect bread in my humble opinion. The only alteration I made was to only add 1tsp of salt. I would not make the whole recipe in the bread machine because it is a bit of a dense bread and it will turn out too heavy. This recipe is now one of favorites, thanks for sharing Destiny!  a little tip how do you know when the bread has risen enough? The dough will double in size. It will be soft and look a bit airy. When you touch it with your finger, it will feel soft and an indention in the dough will remain. If it feels a bit springy and the dough bounces back from the indentation, it hasn\u2019t risen enough.",

                "reviewBody": "OMG! This bread is sooo good it disappeared right off the table in no time. I tweaked it a bit after reading some reviews. I used my bread machine to make the dough and my oven to bake it. First, I put in warm water and yeast and let it stand for 10 min. This activates the yeast. Then I added all the ingrediants, making sure to add the salt last (on top). I used half All-Purpose flour and half Bread flour. I also reduced the salt to a rounded tsp. I set my bread machine for the rapid french coarse. This worked better than the dough setting which only allows one rise. I set a timer to remind me to take it out before the machine started baking. This gave the dough more needing and rising cycles. As many have suggested, I divided and shaped the dough and let it rise on the baking stone or pan (because transfering your dough can possibly make it flatten) which I covered with parchment paper and a sprinkling of cornmeal. You know the dough is ready to bake when it is soft and leaves an indentation when gently poked. If the indentation fills back in let it rise some more. Rise range 40-60min. I applied the egg solution using a paper towel softly brushing the dough. I think this is better than using a stiff brush because the dough can easily flatten. I pre-heated my oven to 400 and when I was ready to put in the bread I turned it down to 375. I didn't use the water or ice cube at the bottom of the oven as some have suggested (I forgot). But my crust came out crispy, flaky, perfect!",
