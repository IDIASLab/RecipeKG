I didn't have quite enough margarine, so I used a little crisco to make up the difference and I didn't melt them though, I cut it into chunks and then used the mixer to whip the icing until fluffy. I needed to add a little more milk as it was really thick to spread. The second time I made this I used all margarine and still had to add more milk than specified. This is very good frosting, nice and thick a bit sweet so I added some more cocoa powder to tone down the sugar some. Good stuff, I'll use this again! Thanks!",
