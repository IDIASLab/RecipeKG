It froze and reheated really well! I would definitely recommend this. It is so easy to go ahead and double the recipe and a huge time-saver b/c of all the vegetables you have to chop. Secondly I added more vinegar to mine... I felt it gave the recipe more of the characteristic sloppy joes flavor. I went ahead and added twice the amount. I also only added 1/2 the amount of chili powder the recipe calls for and 1/2 the amount of black pepper. I like spicy stuff but all that pepper was still a little too overpowering for my tastes and it took away from the other flavors in the recipe. Overall this is really filling and even sort of fun to eat too especially with the kaiser rolls!",

                "reviewBody": "\"The best vegetarian food I have EVER tasted\"...\"A meat lover's perfect non-meat meal\"... those were some of the wonderful things my boyfriend was saying as he was eating his. He was almost in shock at how great they were (he's a carnivore at heart). I thought they were spectacular as well... and being a vegetarian myself I was able to appreciate them even more. I made a few alterations to the recipe though... my favorite alteration was using a red pepper instead of a green pepper. I think it added just a tiny bit of sweetness to an otherwise super-spicy dish. It also livened it up with more red color. I left out the celery because I didn't have any but truthfully I think it wouldn't have been as good with it. Since I didn't have any diced tomatoes I added 2 8oz cans of tomato sauce (which I think was a wonderful substitution). I also followed previous suggestions not to put in so much chili powder so I put in 1 1/2 teaspoons instead of 1 1/2 tablespoons. This was absolutely the right decision. Even a drop more chili powder and it would have been way too spicy. The best part was that my boyfriend was complaining when he was done that he was too full. That is by far the biggest compliment of them all because he's rarely full after eating a vegetarian meal. This is DEFINITELY becoming a staple in my diet. I couldn't be more pleased.",

This is one and it deserves 5 stars. I added a bit of tomato puree as i wanted a stronger tomato flavor and cut back a bit on the chili powder as previously recommended and i ended up with an excellent sloppy joe. Thanks for helping me to cook fabulous vegetarian dishes. Alongside a green salad with walnuts this is a great nutritious meal. Definately in my new recipe file of things to make over and over.",

I'm surprised at how spicy it was-- usually I leave pepper and added salt out but I was afraid this would be bland so at t?e last minute I went ahead and added the black pepper. Wooo-EEE! It's not terribly spicy but I think it would be perfectly tasty with a little less. I'm returning to dorm life tomorrow but I will make this again next time I am home. Right now I am eating the left overs over brown rice and topped with light cheddar cheese. It's pretty good!",
