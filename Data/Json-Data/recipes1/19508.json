I doubled it using my Breville juicer, so I had pure strawberry juice. I used 4 cups of lemon juice to 2 cups of strawberry juice and that worked well. I also warmed a few cups of water and let the sugar dissolve, added ice to cool, then added the balance of the water. I also used a mini muffin tray, placed a small strawberry in each, then filled with spring water to use as the ice cubes in a large serving container. Between the beautiful pink color and the strawberry ice cubes, it was a such a pretty presentation well received! Thanks! Fun recipe!",

If you prefer a sweeter drink, try using less lemon juice. The sugar on the blended strawberries just acts as a flavor enhancer.\n\n-It takes anywhere from 8-10 lemons to yield 2 cups of juice. The best is handmade of course--but be sure to swirl your pitchers a bit before serving!",
