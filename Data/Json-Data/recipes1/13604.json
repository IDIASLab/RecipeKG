Try 3/4 tsp of mint extract #3. Use 1/2 cup of milk after you whip the shortening and egg together #4. Stir until you get a sticky batter #5. If using a Silpat it will take 12-15 minutes depending on how many you are baking at one time. #6. Try putting a peppermint hershey's kiss in the middle of the cookie after it's cooled for appx. 1 min. Not too much longer though or you won't be able to press the kiss in. #7. One batch makes around 34-37(ish) cookies. Very easy and very quick to make. They were a HUGE hit a the cookie party!",

If you are in a hurry this probably isn't the best recipe for you to work with. I found they do come out as \"balls\" but it's time consuming. Also one swipe back and forth with PAM and wipe it all around your cookie sheet with a paper towel.. allow balls to cool for 15 minutes BEFORE removing from cookie sheet. Balls will crack when they are done in the oven. Allow balls to cool completely another 20 mns or so BEFORE rolling in confectioners sugar. I also upped the peppermint extract to 3/4 teaspoon. These are my husband's favorites. They turned out great!",
