I don't like my chips in the microwave so I baked at 350 for about 6 to 8 minutes. This is a wonderful change from reg. nachos. Oh yeah I used the tostitos scoops and made them my little individual bowls stuffed to the brim with the cheese and alfredo sauce. This is a great recipe to add or subtract any of the garnishes so they never would have to be the same each time you make them.",
