I think this cake would be fine without any frosting if you want to save time and calories. This easily mixes up by hand. No need to break out the Kitchenaid. ",

The only changes I made were to 1) replace 1 1/4 cups vegetable oil with 3/4 cup olive oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, 2) toast the chopped pecans and walnuts in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees and 3) add about 1/2 cup coconut. It tastes very similar to the hummingbird cake from Magnolia Bakery and Buttercup Bakeshop here in NYC. I frosted the cake with a pecan cream cheese frosting: 1) 1/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature, 2) 8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature, 3) 1 pound box confectioner\u2019s sugar, 4) 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 5) 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans, 6) 1/4 cup coursely chopped pecans and 7) 1/2 cup coconut. I made the frosting by hand but you can use a mixer. Start by beating the butter and cream cheese until they're very smooth then add the powdered sugar a little at a time until the mixture is smooth. Then mix in the vanilla extract followed by 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans. Spread the frosting on the cake and sprinkle the coconut and 1/4 cup coursely chopped pecans all over the top and sides of the cake.",

This made 6 large muffins and 24 regular sized. Again they didn't perk up at all and were not fluffy like cake. Next time I may add baking powder and or/ add beaten egg whites or something.
