I cooked for 45 minutes to get them crispy and turned the midway to allow even browning. I poked toothpicks after cooking so everyone would have an easy time dipping into the sauce and am glad I did.

I had to make this at work in the middle of the day so I didn't have any other options but this is the only way I'll make it from now on. I wrapped 1/2 slice bacon around the chestnuts and secured with a toothpick then placed 5 on doubled up paper towels on a paper plate and microwaved it for a minute. This half cooked them. Then I refrigerated and brought it in the next day. Microwaving for another minute did the trick - they were crispy and hot. The only thing I don't like about this recipe is that the sauce is enough for 4x the number of chestnuts in this recipe. Definitely half or quarter this sauce and you'll still have plenty. Beware the grocery store branded chili sauce - this is just cloaked cocktail sauce not chili sauce!",
