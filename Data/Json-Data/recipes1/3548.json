To make it taste more like the sweeter more tender asparagus I added a few tablespoons of honey & it seemed to do it for me. I also tried leaving out the potatoes -- I like a more condensed asparagus flavor. I also added a handful of fresh mint leaves (shredded) with the asparagus in the broth to be cooked & blended. This gave it a very cool lite flavor. This soup tastes great chilled --especially a day later when made like this.",
