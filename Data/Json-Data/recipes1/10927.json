They don't really taste a lot like griddle pancakes.  They have a more eggy texture and flavor, so if you don't like eggs, don't try this recipe.  One suggestion, this recipes calls for too much butter.  I only added two tbs. and I baked it in a glass pan.  This allowed the pancake to get crispy on the top and bottom.  More butter can be added after it is baked (if desired).",
