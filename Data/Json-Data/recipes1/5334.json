After reading other reviews, I skipped the glaze, and they tasted just fine - I think the glaze would have been over-the-top. For those whose cookies fell apart, it might have been due to having too much liquid. Squeeze the juice out of the grated apple before adding it. You can actually reserve the juice and use it as part of the apple juice requirement. Using two apples, I get enough juice to not need any additional juice at all. Also, last time I made these, I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and didn't miss it at all.  I think next time I will also reduce the butterscotch chips to 1 cup.",

I took the advice of others and used the juice from my apples but the dough still looked a bit runny so I put about a cup of oatmeal in the food processor to make it a fine flour and added that. I also used the processor to break about a third of the butterscotch chips into bits. The cookies came out with perfect texture and a wonderful flavor. Even the after taste is awesome. I just want to eat one after the other! Highly Recommended!",
