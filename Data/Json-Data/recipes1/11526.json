Caviat: I orginally made this recipe as is and it was good but I felt like I wanted more of the cheesecake flavor and less of the whipped cream flavor. So I put in another block of cream cheese. Now I made this recipe for 40 people so my ratio was 2 blocks cream cheese (8 oz) one large tub of whipped cream 1/3 cup of milk (not adding more milk helped thicken it a bit) and added powdered (not granulated) sugar to taste. I found it had more of a cheesecake flavor this way but both ways were delicious depending on your tastes. PS--I made it as a fruit dip for a shower but it is very similar to what we use for Mississippi Mud Pie. Great!",
