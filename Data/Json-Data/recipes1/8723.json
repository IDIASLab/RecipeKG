        "description": "This is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish which is often reserved for very special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, always use long grain rice. Basmati rice with its thin, fine grains is  the ideal variety to use. Ghee is butter that has been slowly melted so that the milk solids and golden liquid have been separated and can be used in place of vegetable oil to yield a more authentic taste.",

I made a couple changes I added cashews and raisins when adding the chicken broth and I used chicken wings and drumsticks with the bone-in instead of cutting up the whole chicken. This is easier and I wanted to avoid dry pieces of chicken in other biryani dishes that I have had. The chicken came out extremely tender it was falling off the bone. Absolutely delicious! The flavor is mild for the Indian palatte so if you like it spicy add more spice but overall this recipe is a definite keeper. This would be a great dish to make for a lot of people as the quantity is large. Also be sure to use basmati rice with this it is so aromatic and delicious.",

I had to double all the curry spices and added a good helping of garam marsala. I never even tasted a hint of mint so I'm thinking that doubling the mint might help as well. When you're cooking your rice I would eliminate the onions and let the spices sit in the oil until it's nice and fragrant. Then add the rice and cook for five minutes to let the rice absorb some of the flavors. Once you've added it to the rest of the recipe don't cook on the lowest temp or it will get soggy. You need to cook basmati rice on a med-low heat and much faster to avoid soggy rice. This recipe is HUGE. I cut it down to four servings and still had too much food.",

Hint on how to make it not take so long...measure out all of your spices and ingredients prior to cooking.  Do all of your chopping of the onions and all first and it will go a lot faster.
