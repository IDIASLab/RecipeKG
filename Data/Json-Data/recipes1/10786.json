Since I love both chocolate and honey I thought this pie deserved a try. I baked Angela's shortbread crust (recipe found on this website as well) stirred chestnut tree honey (very strong taste) in the whipped egg white followed the recipe and finally tasted it. Even if it is uncommun the mix between chocolate and honey is great. Despite that pure chestnut tree honey has a very strong taste it was quite discrete in this pie just a subtle after-taste. The only suggestion I would make is to rather use a tart shell than a pie shell. For the record I've never found any honey pie recipe especially not a \"wild honey pie\".",
