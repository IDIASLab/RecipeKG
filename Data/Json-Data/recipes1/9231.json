I also substitued ground ginger instead of fresh. 1/8 tsp. ground = 1 Tbsp. fresh; I added a tiny pinch but you'd need even less than that if you aren't doubling the recipe. The sauce never really thickened to a \"gooey\" consistancy but maybe I just needed to keep it in the oven longer... I ended up pouring the marinade over steamed white rice & serving as a side dish. Chicken turned out tender sweet and delicious and the whole meal disappeared within minutes. I'd have given it a higher rating but for the fact that you have to marinade the wings for 4 hours.",

Marinating the wings overnight in the fridge gave them an amazing color even before baking. I also used a baster to remove about a cup of the marinade before putting them in the oven because I was afraid it would bubble over and make a mess. I baked them uncovered 45 minutes turned them then baked another 30 minutes in a 350 oven. The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender and the wings were a beautiful color and sweet and gooey as promised. Will keep this recipe!",

I use a 10oz. bottle of Kikkoman soy two cups of brown sugar garlic powder (as much or little as you want) and ginger (again as much or as little as you like. I mix everything together in a bowl. I buy Perdue wingettes and lay them in a large foil roasting pan (like the one you'd use for a large turkey). I don't use my own pan because I did it once and the clean up still gives me the chills. This way the foil pan is deep enough for me to baste without it going everywhere in the oven and I don't have to be careful about splashing or anything else. And it's great to be able to throw it out afterwards. Make sure you taste the marinade before you pour it over the wingettes. Just make sure you can taste both the sweet and salt and that one taste isn't overpowering over the other. The marinade should be on the thick side. It will loosen up as it gets hot. Bake at 350 from anywhere to 3 to 4 hours. The times that I've been rushed and have cooked them for only an hour or two they've never been gooey. The longer they're in the gooier they get. These wings have always gone over well.",
