Instead of frozen or canned vegetables I used the fresh veggies that were in my fridge: celery carrots and green onions. I also used dry organic alphabet vegetable pasta. The result was wonderful but after the leftover soup stood for a while the pasta absorbed more water and the soup thickened considerably. I didn't put even close to the reccomended 8oz. Haha. next time I'll try putting much less pasta in. It's a work in progress;)",
