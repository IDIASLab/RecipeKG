The meat is intended to have sauce added when placed on the bun. You want the smokey flavor of the pork (not all the spices). When you smoke a pork butt (or in this case, cooking it in the crock pot)the purpose is to get the pork very tender. You dress the pulled pork after its done with sauce, Jalape\u00f1os, onions, swiss cheese, etc. This recipe is perfect for what it is intended to do--make the pork tender!",

They were sampling \"Cattlemen's\" BBQ sauce at Sam's and we instantly knew that it was the sauce that would make my main course a huge hit. By the third batch I didn't bother browning the pork, onions, or garlic. Just throw it all in the crockpot and cook on high for 6 hours. The meat was so tender all I had to do was press it with a fork and it fell apart. I did not use the juices in the crockpot after the meat was cooked - it sounds like some did. I stirred the pork in Cattleman's and bagged it in ziploc freezer bags and froze for the big day. I let them set out overnight to defrost. I saved a quart of the juices in the fridge just in case I needed them to revive the pork, but it was not necessary at all so I discarded it. ABSOULTELY WONDERFUL!",

I seasoned it with \"Cajun Seasoning Mix\" from this site and added it to the slow cooker along with a bit of minced garlic. I left out the onion (personal perference when it comes to pulled pork). I've done a few \"southern\" pulled pork recipes and most call for cider vinegar vs. just water so I used 2 cups of apple cider vinegar and 2 cups of water. I let that go for 5 hours on low. I removed the meat and shredded it with two forks. I drained the liquid reserving 2 cups and put that back into the crock pot along with the shredded pork and then added 2 Tbsp. of liquid smoke. I also added a little brown sugar and cayenne pepper. I let that go for another hour on low. This is great topped with your favorite bbq sauce or try \"White BBQ Sauce\" from this site along with a side of coleslaw and cornbread!",

The meat probably isn't flavorful enough to stand on its own and so should be made into sandwiches or add barbeque sauce (eta - smokey mesquite bbq sauce will probably be your best bet with this recipe). I made a couple adjustments for this - I used olive oil instead of butter for browning the meat and cooking the vegetables - a little healthier. I used less liquid smoke and added about 2 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce to the slow cooker. I also added a couple sprigs of fresh thyme and one sprig rosemary to the slow cooker and removed it after cooking. I also used 1 can chicken broth and 2 cups water for the liquid in the slow cooker to give it a little more flavor. For cooking time I kept this in the slow cooker on high for about 2 hours and then lowered the heat for the remaining time and everything turned out really well. I used this for pulled pork sandwiches (on a kaiser roll with a little apple cider vinegar some texas pete hot sauce and topped with restaurant-style cole slaw made from the recipe on this site). The sandwiches turned out really well!! As good as any I've had in the restaurants in the south. I'm not sure that I'd make this to eat without the coleslaw and hot sauce to add flavor or some sort of BBQ sauce but it was the perfect recipe for the sandwiches.",

So I followed the recipe except that my meat was not cut up, I cooked it all on the bone. I used quite a bit more liquid smoke, also. My meat was so tender that it literally fell off of the bone and shredded by itself. lol It was pretty flavorful, but I added additional cajun seasoning and garlic to the meat after I shredded it. I served Jack Daniels BBQ sauce on the side. Great comfort food! Thanks for this recipe!!!",
