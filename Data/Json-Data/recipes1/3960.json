I bought some kielbasa on special this week and was looking for a good recipe to try. This was perfect! My husband and I both agree we will never have \"regular\" split pea soup again. Here is what I changed in the recipe: used chicken broth instead of beef and used turkey kielbasa instead of regular. It was fantastic. I did have to add a fair amount of water; the recipe didn't say to cover the pot while simmering so some of the liquid boiled off. Next time I'll be sure to cover it. Thanks for a great recipe!",

Judging by the amount of fat we poured off, I'm glad we did, or the soup would have been too greasy.  Then we poured the peas in and finished them cooking with everything and pureed everything pretty smooth in the food processor at the end.  Delicious!",

I followed the recipe as directed and got the last instruction that said \"simmer until peas are soft but NOT mushy.\" I had never made split pea soup before so I did not expect that it would take 2 HOURS for the peas to get soft. The liquid kept evaporating so I added more water periodically (make sure you cover with a lid) but I was never quite sure what the \"soft but not mushy\" consistency was supposed to be. When I have eaten split pea soup before it was very smooth but was this supposed to be a little chunky? I cooked until I thought the peas were done but was very frustrated by the unexpected length of time it took (we ate a late dinner last night). The taste was enjoyable and we liked the kielbasa sausage flavor but we did not like the consistency of the soup. Perhaps I did something wrong but I wanted to write this in case anyone else comes across this problem.",
