I have a bit of a cold..so maybe not the time to rate things on taste... I took some of the reviews and cooked it at 324 for 45 minutes and it was perfectly done.",

I had a cinnamon graham cracker crust I needed to get out of the way but no 1/2 & 1/2 cream or gelatin most other pie recipes call for and this was perfect! The sweetish crust and the tangy/tart filling were perfect together! My husband isn't a dessert eater and he had two generous pieces. I was worried about it setting up so I raised the temp to 375 for the last three minutes and cooked it three minutes beyond the end time. The filling was not as stiff as pumpkin pie or cheesecake but wasn't terribly runny either. The crust didn't burn but came close enough that my husband asked about it. I might just raise the temp to 325 for the whole duration if it is a problem after I make it again. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise. It would be easily modifiable with different spices extracts and liquors.",
