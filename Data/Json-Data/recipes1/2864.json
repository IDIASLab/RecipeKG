I used Grade A Dark Amber syrup so it was just a subtle but very nice maple flavor. I also replaced the sugar with Splenda and used almost all wheat flour because i ran out of white. Wonderful recipe! Later note: I made this again in a regular muffin pan and with the whole recipe. I replaced the shortening with 1 tbs shortening 1 tbs butter and 2 tbs applesauce. I used a little over 2/3 cup of maple syrup and added a little less than 1/4 cup of toasted chopped walnuts. This time i used all white flour and it was soooo delcious i ate about 5 of them. The bit of toasted walnuts was REALLY delicious in it. I LOVE this recipe to death.",
