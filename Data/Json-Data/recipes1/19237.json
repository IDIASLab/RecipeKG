I used garlic dills instead of sweet a red pepper instead of green and Hellman's mayonnaise instead of Miracle Whip--that's really just a personal family preferance not a reflection on the recipe. Though I did not try this myself the kids LOVED this salad. They thought that using american cheese and bologna in a cold salad was the best idea ever. My son said it's like eating the best parts of the bologna salad mixed up with pasta. Winner winner.........pasta dinner!",

All of this was based on what I had on hand and/or family preferences. Also I tripled the celery for extra crunch. It was the PERFECT amount of creamy deliciousness and one could serve this as a one-dish lunch or even a summertime dinner. I never would have thought to put these ingredients in a creamy pasta salad but it totally works!",
