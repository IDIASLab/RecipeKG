Instead I made the bottom layer with the cream cheese/pudding mixture. The other thing I liked about this recipe is that I was able to use all lowfat or nonfat items( light cream cheese lowfat milk a fat free/sugar free white chocolate pudding mix(instead of vanilla) a reduced fat graham cracker crust and lite whipped topping) and it was still really good. And I recommend topping the whipped topping with chocolate chips. This recipe was easy looked good and tasted great.",
