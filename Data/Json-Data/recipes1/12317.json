A few pointers...  This is a DENSE bread, the last one I made I actually weighed on my kitchen scale and it came to just under 2 1/2 lbs!  This probably due to the 2 1/3 cups mashed bananas; I generally use about 5 medium size bananas but have used a little as three and it still came out good.  If you like a lighter cake or muffin type bread, look elsewhere.  Mix the ingredients carefully; I use my mixer to cream the butter and sugar and incorporate the eggs, but for the bananas and flour mixture I use a wooden spoon and mix gently until everything has just come together.  I also add about 3/4 to 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  350 degrees for 1 hour, 15 minutes works for me but it is extremely important that I watch where my oven racks are positioned, too high in the oven and the bottom will not bake correctly, too low and it burns before the middle it cooked through.  I position my rack one notch lower than direct middle of my oven and it comes out perfectly.  Test with a toothpick in several places for doneness so you don't mistakenly hit a banana piece and think it is underdone.  I think that's it!",

I replaced all the eggs with EggBeaters, used whole wheat flour instead of white, instead of 2/3 the butter I used apple sauce, and added cinnamon, nutmeg, and cinnamon chips.  I also sprinkled the top with a bit more brouwn sugar.  I had no problem with it rising, and it cooked very nicely and actually a bit quicker than the recipe said!  The color was gorgeous and the cinnamon chips made wonderful little cinnamony gooey spots in the bread.  It was quite moist, too.  I wasn't blown away by it, but then again I don't really like banana bread (prefer pumpkin bread, mmmmm!!!!!!!), but my mom said it was the best banana bread she's ever had and took some with her to work and everyone loved it!  It was also very easy to make, so I'll probably make it again it we ever have ooky bananas.  I also recommend that you replace some of the ingredients like I did because it makes it a lot healthier.  Enjoy!!!",
