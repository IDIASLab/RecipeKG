(If you haven't tried Corwynn's other recipes head straight to her list!) Delicious hearty dish with a complex savory flavor; must be the combination of the thyme and the beer. To mix it up a little I added a packet of dry onion soup and used fresh veggies (sweet potato carrots and celery). Since I used sweet potatoes I did not add the brown sugar. And as much as I love butter I decided to cut back on the saturated fat by browning the meat in a few tablespoons of olive oil instead. These changes made the stew a little healthier but still tasted rich even decadent. This was a hit with my family even my picky 6 year old. This is definitely our new family stew recipe.",

Add them to the pot when you first put it in the oven or they won't cook through. I also had to add 1 T. cornstarch mixed w/1 T. water to the gravy as it wasn't as thick as I like. Oh and salt! It needed at least 1 tsp. salt as well as some pepper. I thought this stew was really tasty but no one in my family raved. They all ate it but it wasn't like \"More more more!\" Actually it was much better the next day. In the future I think I'll make it ahead of time and reheat it.",
