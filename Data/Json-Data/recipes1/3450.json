I started by using more broccoli than it called for ( i used 16 oz snd it still wasn't enough ) and i pre-cooked it. I than put about 3/4 of it in the blender for a creamier texture. I also used fat free cream cheese and 2% velveeta it tasted no different just made me feel a little healthier. I also added lots of cajun seasoning blend.",

The cream cheese is very good it gives it a creamy taste & the onion gave it a little bit of sweetness-I'm sure with a little tweaking to our liking it will be awesome.

I cubed the velveeta before putting it in and it melted very fast but I did have my temperature up too high for a small part of the melting process because I found that the Velvetta scorched a little and left browned pieces. They taste the same just look different in the soup. I did use more broccoli than called for I found 16oz to be perfect for broccoli in every bite. Overall this is a good recipe I enjoied it.",
