I only ended up with 10 cookies. But even if you got 2-3 cookies for every 1 that I made that's only 20-30 cookies. Still these turned out beautiful. I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening. Perfectly round with a little crisping around the edges and a soft chewy center. I actually like that it doesn't make a lot of cookies because I like to try new recipes daily and don't need a lot of \"extras\" around. Thanks!",
