Instead of the raisins and almonds I chopped up 3 small apples and 1/2 cup of pecans. Mixed the apples pecans 1/4 cup brown sugar a small amt of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp vanilla with the cinnamon and only a dash of nutmeg. I waited until the bread was 1/2 raised cut a deep hole in the center stuffed the loaf with the fruit and pulled the dough over the top and turned off my machine to let it raise for about 45 min. Then turned it onto bake. It was wonderful. Very light fluffy and the center was like a turnover. A little butter and honey to top it off.",

My bread machine really struggled with kneading it, and I finally put more butter, some oil and a little more water in. I lost track of how much I ended up adding, but it was at least 2 T of butter and 1/4 C of water. I will definitely make this again (and again) because it is very yummy. Next time, I will start with 3 cups of flour and go from there. I\u2019ll report back after Christmas.",
