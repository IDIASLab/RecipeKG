I would have never thought to grill an avocado before but this really did give the guacamole a nice smoky taste! I cut the recipe in half and used minced garlic with a bit of kosher salt vs. garlic salt. I also added a bit of cumin and I loved the creaminess the sour cream added to this. Overall a wonderful recipe especially served with warm tortilla chips!",
