The Herbes de Provence and pistachios totally make the dish! What an amazing combo of flavors. Few ingredients, but packed with flavor.  It tastes like it's from a fancy restaurant. The cooking time is spot on. I pulled it out right at 25 mins and it was a perfect medium-rare to medium.  Thank you Chef John! You really created a masterpiece which made for a perfect New Year's Day dinner!  I can't wait to make this for guests.",

This was the 2nd lamb dish from Chef John that I followed, and I have to say I prefer this more. The mustard and pistachio crust gave a nice crunch but it was still pretty subtle so that my taste buds paid the most attention to the meat. I didn't find Herbs de Provence so I just seared the meat with salt and pepper and used leftover Italian bread crumbs with the pistachios. Maybe a little lavender from HdP might have made this even better, but I was pretty happy as is. I got the racks at Costco and they were tender, juicy...yum! I bought 6 racks for 7 adults & 2 kids...and that was WAY too much meat! (We really only ate 4 racks total) I lined all 6 racks on a baking sheet standing upright and cooked for 26 minutes. It came out a perfect medium rare and looked like something from a fancy restaurant. This is definitely a keeper!!!",
