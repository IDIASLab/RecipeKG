I used a little less berries only because I only had about a cup of chopped fresh strawberries. The kids LOVED this breakfast especially my youngest boy. This was a great way for me to get him to eat as he's always been a little finicky in the mornings. Today I did not have one issue. He ate his and asked for seconds.",

I made them a little larger than 1/4 cup because I wanted to be sure there was enough room for the filling; ended up with 6. The banana-nut flavor really shines through and is worth the price of a package of muffin mix. We ate them with our hands like a taco and they really don't have to be hot to be enjoyed either. And they include some of my favorite food yogurt and fresh berries.",

I made a cream cheese mixture of cream cheese sugar and vanilla instead of the yogurt and I used buttermilk pancake mix as I was out of muffin mix. I did use strawberries and bluberries.
