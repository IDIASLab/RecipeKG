I used some of our homemade thick-cut bacon, so I only used 6 slices, and felt that was plenty. I also used homemade croutons, and left off the Swiss cheese, as my hubby doesn't care for it. I layered the croutons and cooked bacon in the pan, added the egg and veggie mixture, then sprinkled the cheese on top of that--and I would layer it that way again since it worked beautifully. Also, there's no pan size listed, so I guessed, and went with a glass 9x13\". Worked perfectly! (it took 33 minutes for the casserole to bake).  I could see where adding some extra heat (maybe in the form of diced jalapenos) would be fantastic as well. Thank you for the recipe!",
