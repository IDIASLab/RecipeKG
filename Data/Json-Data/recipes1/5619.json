Used our own home canned tomatoes so no green chillies. Added some salsa and chili powder to it. Used far less egg noodles. Want more meat then noodles/carbs. Used real cheese shredded 2% fat instead of fake cheese. Taste great and worked well! Will likely make again",

I only used one pot one that could be both on the stovetop and the oven I m lazy that way. Also I did not use noodles as I am a lo-carber.
