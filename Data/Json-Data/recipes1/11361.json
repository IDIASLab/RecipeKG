Be sure you tell whoever helps you that you are cooking salmon on the wood so that you do not get any creosote wood or other treated wood. Also, make sure you know what plank size will fit in your smoker before you go to get the wood. This salmon will come out very moist and smoky, so be prepared for some of the best smoked fish you've ever eaten!",

I like salmon, it tastes wonderful...if done right.\n\nThis recipes doesn't need modification, but I did do a few things different.  I think the impact was minimal:\n\nUsed the basic brine in the footnote, with a little modification:\nWater, soy sauce, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, brown sugar (extra), normal iodized salt.  At the end I added orange juice and lemon pepper.\n\nSoaked fish overnight and followed the recipe.  Used double barrel charcoal pit with charcoal and wood chunks in small barrel and fish in big barrel.  Replenished charcoal and wood when it got low.  ~3 hours cooked, you could probably give or take an hour with no harm if smoking and not broiling.\n\nIt was wonderful.  Next time I'd like to try something exotic.  I'd like to use more juices in my brine and layer the fish with fruit.  Mandarine oranges, pineapple....  I think that might be really good.  Then again, it came out great and I'd hate to mess up a wonderful recipe.\n\nThis recipe is a keeper and will be used very very often in this house.  You can't beat the health benefits of salmon with this wonderful taste.",

I used about half as much charcoal as usual. After starting the charcoal I waited till the apple wood and alder wood chips started to smoke before putting the alder planks and the salmon on the top two grlls. I had to saw the planks in a circular shape to fit the grill and used the scraps from that along with apple wood for the smoking. I smoked it for 30 minutes and took the lid off to prevent over heating and put the lid back after about 5 minutes and smoked another 30 minutes. Then I took the lid off and basted with the brown sugar mixture and smoked for another 30 minutes. I smoke two 3 pound filets from the grocery store. Where I live fresh caught wild is not an option. I wish it was. But it was great anyway. BoRoo",
