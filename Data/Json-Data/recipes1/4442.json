I used 2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1 stick butter and 5 tbsp. sugar for the crust and baked 6 minutes in 350 degree oven.  Also added some lemon zest to the juice and used 4 oz. of the cream cheese. Next time I will use the 8 oz. of the cream cheese. I am also going to try it with lime jello and the juice from limes (a key lime twist perhaps!!)  Thanks Glenda for the recipe!",

Putting the evaporated milk in the freezer for about 1 & 1/2hrs and chilling the beater and bowl made whipping the milk a breeze. Even my husband (who doesn't usually enjoy desserts) loved it:-)",

First I'm not sure how we should have eaten it with our fingers or with a fork... as it was really frozen hard to cut with a fork. Second the taste was great although being so cold it tended to lose a lot of taste... just like when something is too hot it taste less same thing when it is freezing cold. BUT I'm really not discarting the recipe I simply think that it would gain in being served perhaps 15 minutes after being taken out of the freezer... which if the case should have been noted in the recipe.",

It would have been better using a crust made from Nila wafers or maybe a shortbread type crust. I think those types of crusts would compliment the lemon flavor instead of clashing with it the way the graham cracker one did. My other thought is that it would be a more successful dessert if it were a bit more firm. The filling was just too mushy to serve well. I think a little for firmness would also make the dessert more palatable.",
