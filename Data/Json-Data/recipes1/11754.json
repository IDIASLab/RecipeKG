After looking through the cupboard, I narrowed down the choices to an envelope of Liptons dried soup mix and a can of French Onion Soup.  FOS won out....    Pureed the onions in the soup and then added chicken broth to make up the difference in liquid.  Wonderful with substitutions ~",

I used a yellow onion (all I had - I rarely buy red) and sauteed it in half butter, half olive oil, and cut back on the pepper, to 1/4-1/2 tsp (I just grind it in).  Delicious!  It's a very flexible recipe provided you stay within the 1:2 rice:water ratio.  We also like to add a bit of minced garlic just before adding the broth.  Editing to add sometimes it takes a little longer than 20 minutes (I find it takes 25-30).  Using equal portions of onion and rice (ie. 1 cup of raw onion, 1 cup of uncooked rice) seems to offer the perfect ratio (for us).  Also very good if you let the onions turn translucent prior to adding the rice so they brown a bit while you \"toast\" the rice.",

Basmati rice worked well for this, and I browned it with the oil and onion for a few minutes. I added parsley, thyme, and basil and increased the broth to 2 cups. Just a few grinds of pepper was all it needed. Try grating in a few baby carrots to give it a nice color. I'll make this again, probably adding almonds or pecans.",
