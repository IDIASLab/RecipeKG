Thanks you Candy for sharing this recipe with us. I would like to add that I have given this recipe to at least 20 people. This recipe is to die for and the name of it should be changed to Sesame Anise Cookies so more people can find it and enjoy it!",

So I made the first batch to \"test\" the flavor and WOW was I surprized at how delicious these little cookies were! This is a winner in my book and my short-lived scepticism has now gone south for the winter! I found that I had a lot of sesame seeds left over so I made another batch...after all I had a big ole fat box of LARD taking up space in my kitchen. I browned the sesame seeds slowly in a large skillet using a small amount of butter and stiring with a wooden spoon. These will now join the rank and file of traditional Christmas cookies I make every year. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe Candy!",

I didn't bother toasting the sesame seeds since they would be toasted while baking. the bursts of flavor from the anise seed and the sesame was wonderful. this is not a sweet rich cookie but a beautiful potpourri of anise and sesame. ty for this darling cookie.",
