A pinch of oregano and basil is not enough to flavor all the tomatoes paste and sauce. Like others I upped the oregano and basil. I added fresh ground pepper salt a bay leaf and fresh basil. This also has a strong tomato paste taste. Maybe half the can would do. I finally had to add some beef stock to this to get the thumbs up from everybody.",

Something I learned from the Italian wife of my brother, while sauting the onions and peppers, added the tomatoe paste and cook it till it starts to gets dark.  This will add a great deal of charater and flavor to the finished sauce.  I also used only freash herbs.  I add the basil and oregano during the last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking because the herbs will have their flavor cooked out if left too long; this way the herbs will still have that bright fresh zing to them.",

This one is a keeper even the little spaghetti lovers in our family liked it. I did make the following revisions: More oregano basil (fresh) & garlic. Fresh tomatoes no sauce 1 can paste and balsamic vinegar and brown sugar as suggested by reviewer J. Logan. We felt this gave the sauce a really unique tasty flavor. I will be bottling this recipe (minus the meat)in the next couple of days. Thanks Frank!",
