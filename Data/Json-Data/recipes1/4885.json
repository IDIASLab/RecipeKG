Well, a family member told me this is the best thing I have ever made. It was a really big hit. I only made a few minor changes. I used a can of diced tomato with garlic, instead of pimento, just for personal preference. I used a whole chopped green pepper rather than just 1/4 of a cup, again personal preference. I sauteed the onion and pepper before adding to the casserole. I also cooked my chicken in a little bit of italian dressing. We all really loved this. Thanks!",

Even my picky 15 year old went back for more! I have made it in it's original form, which is good and also changed it a bit for variety:\n\nInstead of pimentos, I added small amounts of red and yellow peppers (along with the green pepper).  I also added a can of Rotel tomatoes to the mix and used pepper jack cheese along with the cheddar.  This made it have a taste similar to King Ranch Chicken except with noodles instead of tortillas.  You do need to cover with foil while baking to avoid drying out noodles.",
