I also added a small amount of bread crumbs to give it a little more body. Second...instead of soaking the chicken in salt water to reduce blood that would come out during baking, I decided to par boil them in salt water, cutting down coking time in half, and making the chicken super moist. And I dredged them in flour before I soaked them in the egg and Parmesan cheese, so the coating would stick better. I baked at 400 for only about 25 - 30 minutes, because the chicken was already cooked for the most part, all I needed was the parmesan to darken. The result was absolutely amazing, the Parmesan cheese really came out, and my fiance couldn't believe how good it was.",

I work until 11 PM and I was looking for something quick and easy to make this morning for my family to have for dinner and I found this. It is a wonderful recipes. I did make a couple of changes: I also used seasoned breadcrumbs with the Parmesan cheese. I discovered I was out of eggs so I simply coated the chicken in milk and then dredged in the cheese mix. I also added garlic powder and oregano to the cheese mix. These drumsticks came out moist and juice on the inside and cripsy, crunchy on the outside. I thought I would need to cover the pan with foil, but I just kept an eye on them and they browned perfectly!! Very good Anika! I will be making this one again!",
