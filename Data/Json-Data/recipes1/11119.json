I didn't make cornbread to go with it however but did as another reviewer suggested and made garlic cheese toast to eat with it....yum. I do believe that it needs more flavor than what the bacon can give so I stirred in 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease and I added abut 1/2 a cup of diced up leftover Christmas ham. I also followed the advice of others and didn't bother with any pureeing. Will make again!",
