I couldn't eat alot (and luckily it doesn't make alot). It wasn't bad and it had taste but I'm not sure if I will make this one again. I added some green bell peppers and some fresh sliced mushrooms. Perhaps the addition of grilled chicken strips? Or maybe the use of half and half or even less whipping cream? Or maybe you just have to have a love for tortellini to like this. As for us my daughter and I barely finished our plates and my boyfriend helped himeself to leftovers in the fridge instead of trying this.",

Before adding the cream to the skillet I whisked 1 tbsp of white flour into the cold cream to add thickness. And I added a good amount of parmesean cheese in with the onions and basil and also some fresh ground black pepper. In the end it worked out really well but I do agree with the user who said it could stand some salt (that's something to be said since I am the type of person who never adds salt to anything). The sauce didn't have as much taste as I would have liked and I think salt would remedy this perfectly.",
