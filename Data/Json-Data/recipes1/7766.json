We also had some extra Brach's chocolate stars so we put them on top of some of the cookies but they really are perfect just the way they are!",

I tried several different recipes and all of them cake out cakey but this one was soft and chewy and fudgey with the slightest hint of crispness around the edges. I could use a bit more chocolate flavor and a tiny bit less sweetness and I think a bit of vanilla extract would help round the flavor out a bit but these were a big hit. Definitely allow more time than you normally would for rolling them into balls though....people weren't kidding about the messy part. I measured out 5 balls at a time and then put the bowl of dough (almost batter) in the freezer while I rolled the balls in the sugar and arranged them on the plate and then washed the excess off my hands and this method seemed to make them a bit easier to work with but it took much longer than most cookies you back from rolled balls.",
