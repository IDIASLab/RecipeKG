                "reviewBody": "I haven't made this person's recipe, but I have made Creme Brulee a number of times at a restaraunt.  Some observations;\r\n\r\n1. Seems light on the eggs.  If I were making this would probably add 1 more yolk.  Three yolks might be fine.  Trial and error.\r\n\r\n2. Cover pan with foil?  Seems unneccesary, though it might just be an aid to cut down on overall baking time which I expected to be closer to 35-40 minutes.  I usually leave them in the oven until the custard tops set and start to show signs of developing darker spots on top.  The spots become unnoticible (irrelevant) after you caramelize the sugar on top.\r\n\r\n3. Unless you caramelize the sugar on top it's not really creme brulee'.  This step is done only when you are about to serve this dessert.  Doing it beforehand and putting it in the fridge is an unpleasant experience (sugar becomes liquified).  Use enough sugar (white or turbinado) on top or your ramekin to get a nice light covering (you should still be able to see the custard).  Light your torch and start melting the sugar on top in a circular motion.  You're not done until the sugar has gotten bubbly and brown.  Garnish & Serve!\r\n\r\nNote:  With this recipe, you could substitute the vanilla extract for 1/2 a vanilla bean.  Add the split bean & scraped seeds to the heated milk, not the egg mixture.  Remove the bean shell before adding to egg mixture.",

First of all it lacks enough eggs to make it a rich creamy custard. There was hardly an egg flavor at all. And the stovetop step is not needed. The recipe I use takes the cold cream right from the icebox and mixes it with the sugar/egg mixture. I'll just stick to my tried and true recipe from the book. (2 cups cream 1/3 cup sugar 1 teas. vanilla 8 egg yolks...and no pre-cooking before it goes into the oven.) Also brown sugar is so hard to work with...I would only use white sugar for the topping. I'm sure you meant butane not propane.",

I have never had to strain the mixture as others have mentioned - the trick is to continually and vigorously whisk the egg mixture while SLOWLY incorporating the hot cream a tiny bit at a time; otherwise, the hot cream will cook the eggs and you will end up with lumps.  Also make sure to use a thin layer of sugar, or it will not caramelize properly - I personally find white sugar to work best.  This is my dessert recipe of choice to serve to dinner guests!  I think it is every bit as good as the creme brulee served in most restaurants!",
