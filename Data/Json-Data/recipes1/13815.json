It's sweet but not too sweet like ones I've tried that contain marshmellow whip. The only change I made was to use vanilla yogurt because that was all I had on hand. Also I liked the fact that it was a little thick becuase it didn't drip off the fruit right away like some do. Everyone wanted the recipe and couldn't stop raving about it! Even my husband who absolutely hates yogurt and hardly ever eats fruit had more than his fair share. Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe!",
