Should've reviewed a long time ago! Also I am partial to most of chef johns recipes! Keep em coming!Great country style pie -not too many frills let's the fruit shine!

I wouldn't consider myself a baker by any means but after having a huge craving for strawberry rhubarb & watching Chef John's video I knew I could handle this. I didn't have enough sugar so I only used 1 1/4 cups (it was still sweet enough). I did bake it an extra 10 minutes because I just wasn't sure that it was set not sure I needed too. My mother who is an experienced baker was impressed by the glazed fruit on the top (excellant tip to brush it w/warmed jam - presentation was great). It set beautifully after being in fridge. Will definately make again and again and again.",
