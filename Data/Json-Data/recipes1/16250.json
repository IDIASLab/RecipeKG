                "reviewBody": "I am re-posting my original review dated August 16, 2011:  I had a lot of fresh tomatoes that I needed to use, including some super sweet cherry tomatoes and baby romas, so I went about this a little differently. I chopped all my tomatoes and threw them in the pot including the skins, seeds and juices that had accumulated on the cutting board. I sweated them, covered, along with the onions and carrots as the recipe instructs. Then I added the chicken broth, black pepper, basil, celery salt and garlic powder and simmered, again covered, for another hour. I allowed the soup to cool somewhat and pureed it with my emersion blender right in the pot. Then I forced it through a fine sieve, discarding the skins and seeds that were left behind in the sieve. At this point I seasoned it with the sea salt, and less sugar than indicated, because some of my tomatoes were very sweet. Because I intended to freeze this I did not make the roux and add the milk. I will do that step when thawing/re-heating the soup, although I will say, it is delicious just as is. This soup is a wonderful way to highlight the taste of fresh summer tomatoes. The seasonings are perfect, enhancing the tomato flavor without overpowering it. I should note that my photo was taken before adding the roux/milk mixture. Thank you SHORECOOK, and thank your hubby for this wonderful, classic tomato soup! YUM!  Yield was 9 cups of soup.",

After it cooked, I ran the soup through the blender for a smooth consistancy. This was a nice tomato soup that paired well with Italian Grilled Cheese Sandwiches--NO LEFTOVERS. Next time I think I'd use fresh basil and I would omit the celery salt and go with sea salt but really that's a personal preferance, not reflective of the recipe.",

The taste of the fresh tomatoes, carrots and onions totally come through with this soup.  I used fresh chicken broth instead of canned and I only had 1% milk.  Other than those 2 changes I made it as written.  I made on Sunday, refrigerated it and we had for dinner on Monday night.  Served with cheese toasties, this was the perfect meal on a cold and rainy day.  Thanks SHORECOOK for sharing your recipe.  RG made a wonderful selection this week.",

Once all of the vegetables had cooked, I gave them a good whirl in the blender and pureed until smooth.   My soup turned out so thick that I didn\u2019t add any flour.  In fact, I had to thin it using tomato juice and water.  I attribute that in part to leaving the skin on and perhaps because the majority of my tomatoes were Romas.  The soup was excellent!  To complete, I topped with grilled cheese croutons and additional sandwiches on the side.",

I used all the ingredients listed but was too lazy to skin and seed them so I did what another reviewer and just chopped and boiled them with everything else.  Just before roux time, I pureed it all with an immersion blender and put it through a sieve, added my roux and spices and let it simmer for the hour.  Incredible!  Can you say comfort food?

And then there were the rave reviews and overwhelming number of 5 star loved it ratings. We generously give this recipe a 2 rating. Of the four people served this soup only one finished their small bowl. All agreed of having had better homemade tomato soup. No one had any interest in having more the next day.",
