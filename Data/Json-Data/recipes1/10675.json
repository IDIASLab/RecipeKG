The one thing that I won't change about my recipe is to COOK IT COVERED.  If you cook your rice COVERED it WILL be done in about one hour.

Thankfully I did read them while it was cooking - hence the high rating. I did give it 5 stars because it was rather tasty although after the recommended cooking time my chicken was ready my rice was still super watery. I popped it in the microwave for 8 minutes and that seemed to complete the cooking process. I was a bit salty (as others had mentioned) but not horribly so (the only change that I made was that I used Low Sodium Chicken Broth because it was the only thing in the house). In the future I will allow the extra cooking time and I think that I will reduce the sodium by diluting the broth with water. Was interesting cooking rice in the oven - prior to this I had only done it stovetop.",

Made this with Teriyaki Chicken from this site as they both had the same cooking time and temp. Great easy way to make flavorful brown rice - since I didn't have to prepare on the stove top it gave me time to get on the treadmill while dinner cooked. Gotta love that!",
