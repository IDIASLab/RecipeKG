The breading shouldn't fall off and you need quite a bit of butter because the breading absorbs most of the butter and when you turn the scallops over the pan will get too dry if there's not enough butter.

I had hoped that the breading would stick better than being put directly on the scallops.  It didn't help enough.  Half of the breading came off in the pan.  Also use less butter than the recipe calls for or it will be a little greasy.  I will make these again but I will try something else to keep the breading on it better.  Also try to get scallops that are very close in size otherwise some will be perfect and others overcooked.",

In addition, a touch of salt and pepper goes a long way to finishing and rounding the flavor of this dish - that said, when I added the salt/pepper (and a small drizzle of lemon over each scallop), they tasted superb.
