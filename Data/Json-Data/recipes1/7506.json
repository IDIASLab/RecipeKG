We would make this dough just like this and she would put in the whisky (we used Calvert's Blended Canadian Whisky back then; it is no longer available but Black Velvet or Seagram's 7 will work just fine). We would put the dough together then roll it out in batches really thinly and form them and then I would stand at the stove and fry fry fry... it took us a whole day but it was a day well-spent. As I said we would make them by the bushel and we would use a dozen eggs for one batch. Excellent pastry!",
