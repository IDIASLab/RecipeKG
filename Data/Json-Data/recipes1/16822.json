We had an overload of eggplant from the garden this year, and were quickly running out of ways to eat them. This one tastes great, and the kids love it! Great finger food. Great as a side dish at dinner, or just a snack. I like dipping them in ketchup. But also good with ranch or honey mustard, or whatever dipping sauce you want!",
