Then Kick it up a notch and beat until smooth. I added a little orange food color.I wrapped the pan very tightly in plastic and foil kept in refridgerator. Stayed as fresh as the day I made it.Everyone loved it. Definately satifies the sweet tooth.",

I did tweak the recipe just a little as others suggested by adding orange coloring and macadamia nuts. I also made sure that all ingredients were at room temp. I also did use a 9x13 inch pan rather than an 8x8 because this recipe does make a lot of fudge. An 8x8 would be way too small. This recipe was easy and turned out delicious. I am keeping this for future use definitely!!",

I wanted the orange color so I used orange food color and now it's alot like the orangesickles we used to have as ice cream. Flavor is very good. mine came out grainy yet creamy...(hard to explain texture)due to the fact that the cream cheese did not say \"warm to room temperature\" and I think that would have made it very good and creamy. Cold it cooled the chocolate making it a grainy chocolate texture.I will try this again.",
