I bake mine on aluminum foil lined cookie sheets but it is important to make sure that you put the shiny side down so that you are placing the cookie dough on the dull side. The shiny side will reflect tooo much heat and burn the cookies. Once they're baked and cooled you can just peel them off the foil. Thanks Holly.",

Thanks for the tip of the parchament paper guys it worked like a breeze! No sticking to the pan whatsoever. For flavor- I do not like bland cookies so just to be safe I added the teaspoon of vanilla plus half a teaspoon of almond extract. Went beautifully with the nutty sesame flavor....mmmmmm....mouthwatering.......can't stop eating them:) Thank you so much Holly! You're recipe is DEFINATELY worth saving. If you like sesame flavor or want to try it in a new way- this recipe is for you! caution: be sure your drops are no bigger than 1 teaspoon or if you do put them at least 2 and 1/2 inches apart. They like to spread out and get cuddly....:) Take em out when dark around the edges but not burnt...they will be soft and breakable but hardens quick enough...messed up a few cookies when I removed the parchament from pan right out of the oven.....be 'steady' and you'll be fine! Sorry I went on so long hope ya try these and have success!",

I used waxed paper and still had to freeze them for fifteen minutes to get them off the pans. Keep them small or they'll break apart. Also the sesame oil smokes when it's cooking. My kitchen filled with smoke but the cookies were fine. They look good at four minutes but go the six as I found they are easier to remove from the paper. Worth the effort!",

Use a Silpat or one of those flexible silicon baking sheet liners to avoid stickiness instead of grease and parchment paper.

Even still I was never fast enough to finish before the sheet that was in the oven was done baking. But they are yummy and the dough is easy to prepare!",
