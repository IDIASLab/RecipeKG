I cut back on the oregano and added some cayenne a little cilantro and coriander to the other ingredients spice wise. When adding the chicken/turkey I also add 1/2 c of tequila for more of a southwestern flavor. Making a roux of butter and flour adding slowing before serving will thicken it up nicely. Topping with some fresh chopped tomato fresh cilantro and chopped red onion is perfect. We call this 'White Chili'.",

Instead I put 1/2 tbl chili powder - my family loved it! I also did not have cooked chichen so my 1st step was to boil a packed of tenderloins in the chicken broth!!! It worked very well! I thickened the broth with corn starch.",
