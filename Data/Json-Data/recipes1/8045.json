Although I don't use cilantro or lemon juice I usually do add some cumin and garlic to the beans. I make a big sticky pot of white rice and stir the beans (and all of the juice) into the rice. Sometimes we'll grill some chicken breasts on the Foreman cut it into strips and mix them in as well. We top with salsa cheese and sour cream. Makes a great burrito filling too! A filling healthy (a few ounces of black beans has 10 times the antioxidents as the same amount of blueberries!) and tasty meal.",

It came out pretty good but I forgot to spice it up so everyone added hot sauce which also worked out b/c everyone likes it at different levels of hotness.
