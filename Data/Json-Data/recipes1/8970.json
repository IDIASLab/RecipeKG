                "reviewBody": "I always called this recipe \"Deep Dark Secret.\" I have been making this recipe for almost 60 years and have won the best dessert prize three years in a row at Christmas parties at work.   One review mentioned the cake part  took a hour to bake.  My original recipe called for baking it in a 9\" X 13\" pan for 20 minutes.  It is easier to break the cake into pieces this way.  I have varied the fruits at times.  I add a can of crushed pineapple with juice to the mixture.  Also to save calories I frost with cool whip.  Actually at work I could bring the dessert in a bowl, turn it over on a cake plate, and then frost it with cool whip.  Very portable that way.  Another thing I do is to assemble the mountain in a bowl and keep it in the refrigerator overnight.  The flavors really mingle that way and all the juices are absorbed.  The best part is decorating the mountain with red and green cherries.  I drain the cherries very thoroughly on paper towels, so the colors don't run.  It makes a very pretty Christmas dessert, and has become a family tradition.",

It was a bit like a trifle but more satisfying and substantial if that makes any sense. I have made this twice now and both times the cake took a lot longer to bake than noted here. I am not sure if it is because I used a convection oven but both times it took almost an hour before my cake tester came out clean. I did add 1 tbsp of dark rum to the whip cream as I was beating it. Added a hint of heat. Yum!",
