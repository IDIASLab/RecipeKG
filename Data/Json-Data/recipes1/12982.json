I ask you though \"Why spare anything with something so tried and true for quite some time?? I deep-fry mine without shame AND I have PLENTY of sour cream to dip or to spoon onto them (in more polite company that I would never serve this anyway!). My guest and I sit about and eat ALL we want and just ENJOY the wonderful flavor. Usually I serve a nice beet borshch along with the pirozhkis and again there is plenty of sour cream to add to the borshch as well. I only make these a few times a year and like bliny we just stuff ourselves to the gills and have a lot of fun for the afternoon and evening taking our time and slowly but surely depleting the complete supply among 6-8 of us (of course there is the vodka and the music of the bards as well). As they say in Russian \"Tikho yedish dalshe budesh.\" (Slowly but surely.) Now why the 3 stars? There is no dill in the meat stuffing! No dill no REAL pirozhki!!",
