Pan-frying especially for beginners is the easiest way to ensure that the pork is not overdone (you can poke at the meat to feel when it's cooked). I also marinated the chops with some of the sauce for half-an-hour before frying it - don't leave it marinating for too long or the vinegar will denature the meat. Changes to sauce: cut back the ketchup a little double the Worcestershire sauce and halve the vinegar add more brown sugar (this cuts down on the sourness and helps the sauce to caramelise and become sticky). Make more sauce you'll find it disappearing as you baste. You may want to fry some garlic before adding the chops. This sauce is reminiscent of a bbq sauce as others have pointed out but it's lighter and doesn't smother the meat like bbq sauce can. With the changes it's superb with pork. I'm definitely noting it down.",

I did not have any vinegar so I used lemon juice instead and added garlic salt to taste. I also prefer to do things the easy way so I threw the chops in the crock pot poured the sauce over them set the temp to high and let it cook for about 4 1/2 hours. They came out so tender that we could cut then with a fork and one chop (that was thinner) actually fell apart in the crock pot. When we finished them up I was sad that we did not have more! I would give this one more than 5 stars if I could. Deffinantly a keeper!",

That was really great! I wanted to avoid the \"too ketchupy\" taste that others wrote of so I substituted 1/4 c. barbeque sauce for a 1/4 c. ketchup. It actually turned out well my family just doesn't like barbeque. Anyway thanks for sharing!",
