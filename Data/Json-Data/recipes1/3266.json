I personally thought it was just so-so, and this impression was confirmed by the comments it received, just polite \"It was good\" rather than profuse praise and recipe requests that a lot of desserts have been met with. No one went back for seconds, and not one of 8 ladies requested the recipe.  Usually out of that group  at least 1 or 2 like a dessert so much that they ask for the recipe. Won't make again.",

I did not have any problems with the glaze even after boiling for the full 10 minutes. I applied the glaze to the warm cake as directed and let it cool in the pan for about an hour before inverting onto a platter. For frosting I made a simple icing with powdered sugar milk and amaretto. Sprinkled toasted almond slices over the top -- beautiful and received many many complements.",

Still the cake didn't fall out of the pan until I loosened ALL of the edges with a knife. I thought the glaze might make it a little too rich so I only used half - next time I'll use it all the extra flavor is delicious! I don't make desserts often but this is a keeper! Thanks!!",

                "reviewBody": "This was great but super duper sweet! I usually make about another 1/3 of the glaze and add a little salt. I use an injector so the glaze really soaks in throughout cake and you don't get all those ugly holes. Instead of pre-packaged frosting I used 3oz cream cheese powdered sugar and milk. Put it in a plastic bag and drizzle over the cooled cake. Be sure to use the cheapest amaretto you can find! I first used Disarono ( 25) and got two cakes out of it. I have found ammaretto as cheap as 6 for the same size bottle and you can't tell the high quality amaretto from the cheaper brands. Thanks for the recipe.",
