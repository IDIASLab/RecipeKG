I doubled the recipe and followed it almost exactly except I baked the chicken in foil packets with a little oil and some celery. I also reduced the amount of balsamic vinegar to 2 Tbsp. (for 3 1/2 pounds of chicken) and I didn't have any cranberries so I used 1/2 an apple. I know I know it's not really Cranchick salad without the cranberries but it was SO GOOD the way I made it. I'll definately make it again.",

The recipe is perfect as is but for my personal taste I add green apples and grapes. I also put less red onion. I follow the advice of another reviewer and bake the chicken in the oven at 375 for 35 minutes with some olive oil salt and pepper. Even with people having several helpings the original recipe makes way more than 4 servings. I doubled the recipe for a party of 20 people and there was still a lot left over (which is a great thing!). I highly recommend this recipe!",
