I also add 2 teaspoons of fresh prepared horseradish for a little bite but not overbearing and the juice of half a lemon. Just brightens the flavor a bit. Like other reviewers have said just because you massively increase the amount of wieners you don't have to match the increase with the sauce 1 for 1. I also like to brown the wieners in a frying pan before adding to the sauce.",
