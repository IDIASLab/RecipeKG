Omitted the green bell pepper since I don't care for it.  Outstanding!! Huge hit at the covered-dish party I brought it to.  Hubby loved it also!!  I don't believe it serves 12 as listed, unless you make small sandwiches.  I served it on lettuce leaves and it perhaps served 6 to 8.",

There are so many dry ingredients and such little dressing that you can barely coat it all. Way too much crunch. There were more crunchies (bell pepper onion celery pecans) than there was chicken...and the chicken unfortunately took a backseat to the other ingredients. I have no paprika complaints but not sure what it did for the recipe. Maybe you could substitute onion powder for the green onions? And I'm going to skip the pecans maybe go with slivered almonds next chicken salad recipe I try; also nix the bell pepper.",
