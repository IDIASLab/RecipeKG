You might be put off by the inclusion of anchovies, but you will be really surprised at how well the saltiness of the fish works in this dish. If the anchovies are a definite 'no', then substitute smoked salmon. It won't have the same saltiness in each bite, but the salmon can be just as delicious in its own right. This is the one recipe that I  get requests for after parties and there is always an amusing display of disbelief afterwards when the inclusion of anchovies is revealed.",

While these are actually pratt fillets, what is important is the brine they lay in, which is spiced with cloves, ginger and other spices which bring the authentic flavor to this dish. I make Janssons Frestelse throughout the cold season every year, serve it to guests and bring it to potlucks and it is always very popular. Do not fear the anchovies! I always include the brine and usually use two tins. When I make this just for my family I sometimes throw whole tilapia fillets in the bottom of the baking dish and make it more of a balanced meal than a side dish. Lastly, I always use white pepper to season.",
