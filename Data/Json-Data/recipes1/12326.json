One note, I wouldn't use 6 LARGE zucchini, that would be far to much. I think the recipe should read: 6 small zucchini. You could even serve it as a breakfast/brunch dish. Don't skimp on the onions, they are a key ingredient. Will DEFINITELY make this again and again. Thanks for sharing!!\n",

I substituted shredded mozzarella cheese for the romano, added extra black pepper & a few dashes of salt, and used corn flakes instead of crackers for the topping. Instead of using pats of butter, I melted about 1/4 cup of butter and drizzled it over the top for more even distribution. We thoroughly enjoyed this dish hot, cold, and reheated the next day!",
