Pan fried potatoes in a tablespoon butter, added marinated vegetables and pan fried them for about 15 minutes on medium heat. At the ten minute point, I sprinkled a pinch of rosemary over the vegetables. Served with sirloin steak off  the grill.\n\nThis was a great recipe to start with but I just can't follow a recipe to the letter.",

To marinade the vegetables, I cut peppers, onions, squash, butternut squash into squares, put them all into a gallon size plastic bag and poured the marinade in. After shaking the bag vigorously I laid it on the counter, turning it occasionally for a couple of hours. I removed the vegetables, spread them on a cookie sheet and baked them for 8 minutes on each side. Turned out wonderful.",

Also we use a basket-style metal container right on the grill -- it makes cooking much simpler and you can cut the veggies into similar size pieces for equal cooking time.",
