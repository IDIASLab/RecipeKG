That way, I'm reviewing THE RECIPE and not my new version of it.  Ticks me off when some reviewers completely change the recipe and then take off stars cause they didn't like it.  OK, I'll get off my soapbox now!!  DH RAVED about the shrimp!!  And you're gonna think I'm crazy, but try this as a side dish:  reserve some of the marinade (I saved about 1/2 cup) cut a head of romaine lengthwise, leaving the core on to hold the leaves together, and allowing 1/4 head per person, drizzle the reserved marinade over it and let it sit.  When the shrimp are done, cover them with foil and then throw the romaine ON THE GRILL!  Cook it, turning several times, until the leaves are wilted and browning a bit.  Then, either serve as a whole quarter or chop to make a bed for the shrimp!  Better than pasta, cause it's a nice, crisp complement to the juicy shrimp!  Thank you, Robbie, for an excellent dinner last night!",

I say this because we have a beach house on the cost of Louisiana where we get the freshest seafood possible.  The shrimp come striaght from the gulf into our home.  We've tried close to a hundred different grilled seafood recipes & this recipe was absolutely fabulous. It wasnt spicy at all unless you hate spices, because I added a little cayenne to mine. We were short on time & I marinated for maybe 30 min., added a cinammon chiptle rub, & folks this marinade was great!!  Its so quick & easy you can't beat it with a stick! Leave the lemon out if you're marinading for hrs. It makes the texture of the seafood horrible! Add it about 30min befoer grilling!  ",

I only gave it 4 stars cuz i did change a couple things-i added the zest of the lemon (to up the freshness meter even more), and used 1/2 fresh basil 1/2 fresh parsley (mainly cuz i have a garden being overrun by both). I also added some red pepper flakes. Oh, and I find that i enjoy this recipe more when i use ketchup instead of tomato paste,as i like the sweetness it gives. This was all for personal taste, however i would strongly recommend adding the lemon zest to this ( and really almost any recipe that calls for lemon juice.). BIG difference!!",

I threaded the bottom part of the shrimp then put a peice of the pineaplle and then the top of the shrimp went on over it....so good. And I placed the lemon slices on top of the skwers while I was grilling them. Served with Pasta Roni's Garlic and Olive Oil pasta and was so so good. You should try it.

Not to worry! The hot sauce was barely noticable, and didn't even have the slightest bite I was afraid wouldn't work for him.  In fact, he gave this a two thumbs up, as do I.

You can take out a tablespoon or two at time as needed to add to sauces or marinades.  The dollops thaw in just a few minutes.",
