I mixed the melted butter and powdered sugar in the food processor then I poured the vanilla and hot milk (instead of hot water) through the top until it was all blended. The consistency was much smoother and it was easy to spread and very pretty on top of cookies. The icing still dries nicely but you will have more time to work with it if you use milk. Delicious on the Mississippi Tea Cakes!",

I covered it with a paper towel and worked quickly and it came out fine. I've been looking for a long time for a frosting to harden the way this does. This was a practice batch as I cheated and used Pillsbury sugar cookie dough and added rainbow sprinkles and chopped vanilla chips. This frosting was perfect spread on top with a few added sprinkles. Very pretty too! Thanks for a recipe I'll be using often!",
