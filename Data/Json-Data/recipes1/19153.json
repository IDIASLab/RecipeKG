But the citrus flavors were too strong, even with the cream.  My guests were kind.  We didn't have to order a pizza, so it's was \"ok\".  But I won't make it again.  Sorry!  I followed the recipe closely since it was my first time making it.   If I had to make it again, I would use half as much zest and might add some honey to the sauce to see if that would help tone down the bitterness of so much zest.",
