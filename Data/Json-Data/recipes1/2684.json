One error I find in this recipe though is it requires a double crust, not single crust pie shell.Takes about 36 crackers,rind of 1 whole lemon and juice of 1 1/2 lemon. This may help when making your grocery list. Also, it is not necessary to cool pie completely. We ate it warm and it did not fall apart when cutting and tasted great!",
