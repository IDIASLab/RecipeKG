This is so good, I don't even know how to describe it - it's like the very lightest angel food cake ever, drenched in lemony sauce. My kids LOVED it (12 yrs and 2 yrs), and even the picky husband said it was good!  Just be aware that it gets fairly brown - mine was quite dark on top after 38 minutes, but wasn't actually burnt. Trust it! **added later** If you don't have a microplane zester (well, first - get one! Cheap & awesome! 'til then...): before juicing the lemons, use a vegetable peeler to take strips of JUST THE YELLOW part of the peel (no white if you can help it) and whirl those with the sugar in a food processor until they're all blended in. Add that during the sugar step, not the zest step. Works like magic!",
