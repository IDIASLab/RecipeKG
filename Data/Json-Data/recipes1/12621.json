Everyone loved this except the lemon taste wasn't strong enough for us to be a good contender.;) That said this was still an easy super-delicious yet very different chicken recipe! I used a family pack of drumsticks because I prefer dark meat. Followed the recipe exactly for 6 lbs of chicken/8 servings. I set my oven for another successful roasted chicken recipe I use as a benchmark. 425F for 1 hr and about 15 mins was perfect checking every 20 mins. As I had to transport the dish it steamed under foil for an extra 30 minutes which made the chicken extra moist. I do recommend at a least 2\" deep pan. I used a 12x17 jelly roll pan since I was making so many drumsticks and the otherwise yummy carmelized honey glaze totally dried up in that pan vs the 9x9 pan I used for the few pieces I had left over after filling the jelly roll pan.",

However I had some leftover wings from another recipe that I had lightly coated with in a mixture of 3/4 cup flour 1/2 tsp cayenne 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp salt and refrigerated for an hour. I spread the garlic mint mixture on top of those instead of trying to force it under the skin and dipped them in the honey sauce and they turned out really well. We will probably make these again with that light coating of flour and spices and without the mint (we're not big mint lovers). The lemon honey butter sauce alone is 5 stars. Some of it dripped onto my green beans and they were so good that I plan to make a batch of the sauce to toss with green beans next time I want a special side dish. Thank you!",
