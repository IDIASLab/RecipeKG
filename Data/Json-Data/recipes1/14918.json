I added an all natural chicken base to it but you could just add some salt too.  I also used Thai Kitchen brand red curry paste.  I was assuming this is something like what the recipe called for.  Last but not least I doubled the fresh ginger.  Used a stick blender to blend so I didn't have to pour it into a belnder.  AMAZING!!!! Just a note...most brands of \"lite\" coconut milk is just watered down coconut milk.  If you want \"lite\" just use a little less of the coconut milk and add water.  Save money!",
