They were super easy to make as you can tell from the ingredients. I 'tarted' them up a little with a teaspoon of almond extract and garnished with some flaked almonds. Thank you for posting x",

The jam spread out to the edges of the muffin tins and beneath the pie crust and glued the whole thing to the bottom of the (nonstick!) pan. They were impossible to get out of the pan without destroying them. The pieces of cake and jam that came out tasted good (it was just cake mix & jam after all) but the pie crust layer was permanently left in the bottom of the tins. I've never had a problem with pie crust sticking like this before. I'm not sure if they should have been left in the tins to cool - maybe removing them immediately would help? Using muffin liners might also help but it seems like they'd still be a mess to remove from the liners and try to eat.",
