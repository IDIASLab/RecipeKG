The sauce was rich and thick, and very flavorful. Being an experienced cook, it was obvious to me that you would not pour all the seafood cooking liquid into the vegetable mixture, but add only a little at a time, as stated, until desired thickness was reached. I will be filing this with my \"keeper\" recipes and certainly will share this one with my friends.  Thanks for a great recipe!",

I also added a little cayene pepper to it. That seemed to help. I don't believe I'll be making this recipe again however I do encourage others to try it out.",
