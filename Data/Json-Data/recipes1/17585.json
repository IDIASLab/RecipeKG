All the vegies on this too makes this dish very interesting.  My family loved this even the picky ones!  The sauce is way too thin however.  Next time I will try making a thicker sauce by taking half the butter and garlic, adding a tablespoon of flour and sauteeing for 2 minutes, then adding fat-free half&half instead of milk, stirring constantly until thickened and then adding the parmesan cheese.  Then I'll add it all to the vegies/meat.  Hope this works!",

Here are my edits for those who also need to tweak...\n\nSubstitutions based on what I had: Penne for fettuccine, Polska Kielbasa (entire package) for smoked sausage, omitted shrimp (would have been great addition, but I didn't have any), diced yellow onions for green onions, 4oz can of mushrooms stems & pieces, and used the Cajun Spice Mix recipe on here in place of pre-mixed cajun seasoning.\n\nCooking variations: I was using an entire package of kielbasa, so there was no need to add any butter when cooking the meat/veggies. While the sausage and veggies were cooking I made a roux (per other's suggestions) with 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp flour, then added the milk and parm cheese to the roux to make a nice thick sauce. Added wine, spices, chicken, and pasta to veggies. Stirred in cream sauce once chicken was heated and VIOLA! GREAT MEAL!! \n\nDefinitely going to make this one again! Using a full package of kielbasa brought the number of servings up to about 6-7.",

I left out the shrimp due to allergies I know its a big part of the recipe but I really wanted to try it anyway. So I added a bit more chicken and sausage to make up for the shrimp. I cooked the chicken in a bit of olive oil and seasoned with the Cajun spice. I finished the pasta in the sauce so I had no problem with it being to thin. Great recipe. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!",

Yes the sauce is runny because there isn't any thickening agent added to it but that wasn't a problem for us. Tossed the pasta in the pan with all the other stuffs and it absorbed some of the sauce but there was still plenty left. If you want the sauce thicker add some rue. I bet it'd be just as good with it as it is without. Overall a real winner (husband was still talking about it this morning).",
