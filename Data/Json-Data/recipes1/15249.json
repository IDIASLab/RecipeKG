As I'm health conscious when it comes to recipes, I substituted the evaporated milk with the same amount of soy milk and trimmed the butter by half for the crust.  The pumpkin mixture added the perfect amount of moistness to the recipe that no one knew that I'd revised the recipe.  Great all around and super quick!  Try it--it's the next best thing to pumpkin pie without all the hassle!",

Also I added a litle freshly grated nutmeg and a 1/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. This is absolutely delicious.. I haven't made a pumpkin pie since I found this recipe! I give it 5 stars!!",

I made this twice in a span of three days. The first time I followed the recipe to the letter. It was indeed just enough crust to cover the bottom of a 9x13 pan, so the crust was very thin. The filling was also very very thin (not like the main picture shown - which is thicker than what I came out with). Still, the squares were absolutely delicious - the crust was perfect with just a bit of crunch which made it really lovely. I did think to myself that I would like just a tad more filling. Soooo... I made it a second time and doubled the recipe. I made it in two smaller pans (an odd size - around 5x13 I think). While it was nice to have a little more filling, the crust is MUCH NICER as is. The thicker crust did not come out with the same crunchiness that we so enjoyed the first time. It just wasn't as nice. **** So, all in all, a fab recipe, but I might recommend keeping the crust as is and then increasing the filling by 50%. Also, it is much better once it is thoroughly chilled. Enjoy!",
