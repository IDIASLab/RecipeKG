Small problems: I used heavy cream which apparently does not form bubbles around the edges and I was not entirely clear on exactly what \"coating the back of a metal spoon\" really means. (A temperature might have been helpful.) But it turned out quite well anyway. I'm guessing that the stovetop preparation of the custard resulted in it having a slightly more creamy liquidy texture than other cremes brulee but no one complained. Minor quibbles aside it was all in all a good recipe.",
