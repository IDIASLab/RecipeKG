I also soaked the raisins before I put them in the batter which I know should've boosted them up but the thing is this recipe is a tad bit plain. Maybe next time I'll add a tablespoon of cinnamon or maple syrup along with maybe 1/2 - 1/4 a cup of brown sugar or possibly white depending on my sweet tooth that day.",
