And if you don't have a Caesar Salad Kit on hand you can easily do what I did and use light cream cheese mixed with a little garlic and Italian seasoning, Romaine lettuce, shredded Parmesan and Romano cheeses and add use your own croutons or leave them out altogether.  For the Caesar dressing I used \"Caesar Vinaigrette' from this site.  I made wraps into this vs. pinwheels and since this was more of a meal than an appetizer I added some grilled chicken - YUM!",

It was near impossible to drain the sun dried tomatoes as they are sitting in so much oil. The cream cheese got really oily due to the tomatoes and even small bit of dressing added. I ended up making one sandwich and adding turkey and extra cheese and then taking the cream cheese mixture and doctoring it up to make a dip. Something wasn't right about the recipe. As is the cream cheese just tasted too much of sun dried tomatoes and had an odd after taste from the ceasar dressing. Maybe the powder would have been different but I have never seen it in a kit that way. I am giving it a 3 because I tried it as is and didn't care for it. However I was able to salvage it so it wasn't a total flop.",
