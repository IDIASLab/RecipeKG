I took suggestions and lowered the temp to 400F and placed the rack on the 2nd from top position. 7.5 minutes was perfect they were just about to burn at 8 minutes. Used a small cookie scoop. Rolled them into balls and dipped the whole thing in sugar. I skipped the water step. I flattened them slightly before baking. Next time I'll try rolling in cinnamon sugar. This recipe is a keeper! P.S. Use a parchment lined sheet. I wouldn't never bake anything on an unlined sheet unless you like scrubbing.",
