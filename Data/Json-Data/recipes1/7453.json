I baked for an additional 5 minutes then took it out to sit before adding the sour cream. I baked for another 10 minutes and it still wasn't ready so I baked for another 5 minutes before taking it out of the oven for fear of over baking. After 10 hours in the fridge it still wasn't fully formed. I think in the future it needs to be cooked a bit longer before adding the sour cream.

Then I found this in my recipe box exactly like hers. After reading the reviews and my own experience I tried these changes with AMAZING results: Use a whole cube of butter with 9 whole graham crackers in a 9-inch pie glass pie plate. Use 2 8-oz blocks of cream cheese softened with juice of 1/2 lemon and the zest. After the crust bake let cool 15 min. bake with the filling 22-25 minutes. Cool again for 15 min. turn oven off put in with the sour cream topping (I added lemon juice & zest) and a teaspoon of vanilla. Cool in fridge overnight and take out 2 hours before serving with a medley of fresh berries pressed into the top (I used blueberries raspberries and you guessed it - boysenberries!) Beautiful presentation. Unfortunately there will not be a single slice left!!!",
