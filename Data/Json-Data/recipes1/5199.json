It's great as is, and it's also versatile: add a lot of chopped flat-leaf parsley in the last hour; add bay leaves at the beginning (making sure to fish them out at the end!); add chopped fresh basil in the last hour; add red wine at the beginning and boil off the alcohol; throw in a rind of hard cheese.  \r\n\r\nI would add one teeny suggestion: canned tomato sauce is already pretty cooked, and this is a long-cooked sauce.  You may want to use whole peeled tomatoes, which you can either dice and use with the liquid, or whirl it in the blender.  It's no big deal, but it is a far less-cooked product, suitable for long cooking in the recipe.",
