I substituted 2 ounces of the semi-sweet chocolate for unsweetened (actually makes them lower in fat plus the hubby and I like a really dark taste when it comes to chocolate); 2. Added a simple thin frosting of 1 tbsp. butter 1 ounce of unsweetened chocolate 1 tsp. powdered sugar and a tsp. of fat-free milk Thanks for an AWESOME recipe! I will definitely make this again and again!",

These are of course not going to be as good as the butter rich fudgy brownies that we all dream about. But for what they are these are pretty decent brownies. One thing they do have is a rich chocolatey flavor. They are moist but not really fudgy. I baked 1/2 of the batter in a mini muffin pan and drizzled those with vanilla glaze. Then I had enough for a small pan as well. I cut those topped with light cool whip and some leftover raspberry sauce. Now that was good.",

I used milk instead of water about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 2 eggs instead of 4 whites (I only had 2 eggs on hand). That said this was a very good recipe. They weren't as good as regular brownies of course but for being lower in fat than regular brownies these were great. The batter was very thin and I was a bit worried but they cooked up nicely.
