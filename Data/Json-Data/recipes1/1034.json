However it was such a great cake the icing that goes along with it is complementary and I received compliments on it. So my tip is not using the given time and tooth picking it until it is done.",

The first time I made this it was dry and overdone but after cutting 5-10 minutes off the baking time it has turned out perfect. Check by inserting a toothpick in center for doneness. I use a pint of sweet cream sour 1 cups with vinegar and use the other 1/2 cup sweet cream in the frosting in place of the milk. Wonderful wonderful cake! Moist and rich and the frosting is like creamy fudge. Kaye",

I was more pleased with the frosting but I would use less shortening I found it a little greasy. I found putting the saucepan in a bowl of ice-water and using my electric hand beater an effective way to cool and thicken the frosting. I don't think I will be making this cake again.
