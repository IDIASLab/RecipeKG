The recipe was what my boyfriend has been trying to explain to me that his grandmother made when he was younger.....I'll be experimenting with different fillings next time (walnut; poppyseed etc.)! This even prompted me to explore the internet on the origin of Kolacky which is quite interesting in itself. Thanks for sharing such a tasty recipe Della!",
