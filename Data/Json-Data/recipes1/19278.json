I made a few changes only because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand but they were slight. I used pecans instead of cashews and used regular raisins instead of golden and used craisins instead of dried cherries. The roasted beets were delicious in this salad and a great way to use up the beets from the garden. I also added about 2-3 extra beets. One other change was to the method of prep: I poured dressing (only used about 1/2) on just the kale and massaged the dressing onto the kale with my fingers. I do this with another kale salad and it really softens the kale but doesn't make it soggy. Then I added the remaining ingredients. Thanks for the recipe!",

Also because of what I had, used pecans and pine nuts in place of cashews, regular raisins, and dried cranberries. I massaged the kale a bit with a drizzle of olive oil and salt before mixing with other items because I like my kale a bit softer. Great recipe and super versatile. The beets were a wonderful complement to the kale.",
