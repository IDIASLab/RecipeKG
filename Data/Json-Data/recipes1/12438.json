I used a 5 pepper spice blend rather than cayenne. I laid the filets on top of some pre-cooked bacon I had leftover from breakfast. For the ingrediants I added the oil garlic onions salt and pepper to a small microwaveable container. I mixed these items together and cooked on high for 2 minutes stirring half way through. I laid the bacon in the casserole dish the filets on top then covered with the oil/onion/garlic mix. I refridgerated for only an hour then added an appropriate amount of 5 spice blend and covered with foil. I baked for the recommended 30 minutes. It was excellent my husband loved it and so did I! I'll definately serve this or any variation of it again!",

The last thing I added was Pappy's Rub on top of the onions (like a canjun spice mix).\r\nI used my mandolin slicer to thinly slice the onions.\r\nBaked for 30 minutes and broiled another 10 minutes.\r\nThe onions taste more like onions rings when they are broiled and get crunchy.

I baked it for 25 minuted regular and then added fresh parmesean cheese for the last 5 minutes. My 3yr old and 2 yr old eat this better than chicken and usually eat more than one piece each.
