Double it and rub it UNDER the skin (then get rid of the skin - no one needs it anyway). Third: You only need to cook chicken to an internal thigh temp of 165, then remove, cover, and let sit for 15 min.  If you cook to 180 you have a higher chance of drying it out (this is not bogus, it's from the USDA's wesite) Forth, and MOST important: COOK THE CHICKEN BREAST DOWN!  You will not BELIEVE how amazing the breast meat is.  I mean, better than dark meat usually is moistness wise. The skin on the breast won't brown or look pretty...but we're not eating that anyway, right?  If you have to have a crispy breast flip it over for the last 15 min of cooking.",

Like others suggested, I doubled the olive oil and the spices for a 4.5 lb. bird.  I also greased the baking dish a bit, but realized after the fact it wasn't really necessary.  Instead of sprinkling the spices on top of the chicken, I brushed the entire bird with olive oil and rubbed the spices all over it.  I cooked it an additional 30 minutes because of the larger bird, and it came out perfect.  I brushed the bird with a bit more olive oil toward the end as well.  I threw chunky potatoes (all I had were idaho bakers, but they still came out great) in the pan during the last 40 minutes with chunks of onion, and brushed them well with more olive oil and sprinkled them with granulated garlic and salt.  They were so good, it was amazing, I'd never roasted potatoes that way before.  I never covered the bird or the potatoes - it was delish.  I highly recommend this recipe - it was easy and very tasty.",

You can even do as you would a turkey raise the skin and apply some of the rub underneath the skin. I have never once had smoking but it is because it absorbs so much of the oil when it marinates in the refrigerator overnight. We are from LA and like spicy so I also double the amount of spices!",

I love this high heat blast at the beginning to ensure a rich, golden skin, but I was a little more laid back on the remaining cooking time, lowering the heat to 375 rather than 400.  I also rubbed the chicken with butter rather than olive oil (under the skin too!), again to help with browning.  Rather than the seasoning called for I used \"Chicken Seasoning Blend,\" recipe also from this site. (I can't recommend THAT recipe enough!) I filled the cavity of the chicken with sprigs of rosemary, lemon halves and a quartered onion. I roasted it until the thickest part of the thigh registered 170 degrees, which was about 18 minutes a pound (after the initial 20 minutes at 450). I made a rich pan sauce by deglazing the pan drippings with white wine, reduced that, added a good glug of chicken broth, reduced it again, then added another cup or so of chicken broth and reduced it once again.  The sauce, the chicken - simply outstanding.",

                "reviewBody": "It was OK. The spices were good but since I don't eat the skin I didn't taste them very much. The chicken wasn't finished by the end of cooking time (still pinkish inside) although the skin was beginning to darken too much for comfort. I had to pop it in the microwave for an additional 5 minutes to finish cooking the inside. Also there is a goodly amount of smoke involved; I had to turn on the kitchen fan and open a couple of windows.",
