We used white rice (will use brown next time) 1/2 c quinoa 1/4 c chia seeds 1/4 c. raw walnuts 1/4 c. raw sunflower seeds 3/4 c spelt flakes 1/4 c ground flax seed and 1/2 c steel cut oats for example (we don't do corn or wheat in our house but no matter!). We blend all our grains in the blender then carefully use the handle end of a wooden spoon to stir always keeping the wood on the glass sides of the blender. This way the nuts and grains keep moving not gummed up in the bottom. Add in the end: cranberries raisens cranberry/orange relish from Christmas creamed honey cinnamon banana jam/preserves options are endless! My two- and four-year-olds ate it up! A super welcome change to oatmeal according to them. I think you could probably soak all in water with a teaspoon or so of vinegar and salt 24 hours if you prefer that method of \"cooking.\" Thank you!",
