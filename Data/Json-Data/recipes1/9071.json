I was able to use this recipe frozen for make Marcia's Famouns Sticky Buns (on this site) and my family LOVED them! We have a holiday tradition of sticky buns on Christmas morning which went away with the gluten intolerance diagnosis but this recipe saved the day! By substituting Kinnikwik mix for the flour and making just a few changes I had the whole crew raving. My daughter even asked for these for her birthday! I added one extra egg 2T xanthan gum and 4 envelopes knox unflavored gelatin. I rolled the dough into balls and froze them first on cookie sheets then put them in freezer bags. Now I can pull out as many as I need. I may try a less sweet version for dinner rolls the texture was that great! That's a real compliment with gluten free baked goods! Thank you!",

I mixed all the dry and butter in a pan put the egg and water in my bread machine dumped in the dry and let it mix - superb! I don't put mine in the fridge - just use after letting it sit for a few minutes. And to make dinner rolls use about 2 oz. of dough roll and put in muffin pan. I like to drizzle mine with some EVOO. When they come out you can eat then or you can store (I use an old bread bag). When you want to eat them put butter and garlic salt on them heat in the oven and NUMMY NUMMY!!!",

I altered the recipe slightly so I could use my bread machine to make the dough. I added the first four ingredients (flour yeast sugar salt) into the bread machine. Then I melted added the warm water and let that sit for just a minute while I melted the butter. Then I added the melted butter. Whisk the eggs and add to mixture. Then top with remaining flour. My bread machine did a pretty good job of mixing in everything but I found I needed to add a little more flour when I went to roll it out.
