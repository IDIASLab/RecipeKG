My second try I used 2 bananas & 1 cup pineapple. I also used the pineapple juice from the can instead of the water. My family usually calls me Deborah, referring to Raymond's wife who can't cook on 'Everybody Loves Raymond'. Everybody loved this. My sister-in-law asked for the recipe. When she made it she omitted the salt & 1/2 the oil & it was still very good. The best.",

I agree with the other reviewers about cooking time: 1 hr is definitely too much. I only had to cook it for 40 mins. A great busy-day cake! I will be making this again.",
