Fortunately I had prepared rice for another recipe and happened to have plenty left over. Keep that in mind so you that you make plenty of rice and chopped veggies ahead of time. The next time I make it I will sprinkle salt and pepper on the inside of the tomatoes before putting the mixture in maybe even brush a little oil and salt on the outside too. I didn't use parsley but instead substituted oregano. They were delicous and a great way to add a nice colorful vegetable dish to my pork chop dinner.",

The reason why this recipe only got 4 stars was because the pepper pieces weren't as tender as they should have been.  This might be because I used 8 smaller tomatoes and cooked them for 15 minutes.  As for the complaints that there wasnt enough filling, I made 1 1/4 cups of rice and estimated the vegetables and I had the perfect amount of filling.  I sprinkled shredded mozzarella cheese on top of some of them, but I might mix it into the mixture next time.",
