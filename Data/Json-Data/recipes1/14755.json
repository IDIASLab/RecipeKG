I had the cheese curds sitting out for a day before I used them, as others suggested, and coated them lightly with flour.  I made the batter just as it is written and it looked like a thin pancake batter.  \n\nI placed 6-8 of the battered cheese curds into the wire strainer that gets dipped into the grease and the curds immediately stuck to the bottom of the strainer.  Those were ruined.  Then I just plunked the battered curds directly into the oil, and that wasn't much better.  The cheese almost immediately starts to ooze out of the coating and into my deep-fryer oil.  It made a gigantic mess of my deep-fryer. \n\nAfter it was all said and done, maybe half of the curds I made actually retained their cheese (I did not over-cook them), and the ones that did retain their cheese weren't good.\n\nIn fairness, I admit I used canola oil instead of corn oil because that was what was in my deep fryer.  After attempting to make these, I will have to replace the oil because it got destroyed.  A LOT of the batter came off the cheese curds while frying.  \n\nMaybe I did something wrong, but I love cheese curds and I will not try out this recipe again unless someone can tall me what I did wrong.",

It was my first \"Fried Cheese Curd\" experience, but they were fantastic and I would definitely make them again.\n\nOne trick I read elsewhere - let the curds get to room temperature & they will sweat a little... use the moisture to your advantage and coat them with a little flour before battering. It makes the batter stick a lot better!",

I knew what I had to do -- replicate those little golden nuggets of goodness. And this recipe is AMAZING. I feel like I just left the Mouth Trap in the Food Barn. BUT it's very important to a) let the curds sit until room temperature and sweating and b) coat the cheese in flour before dipping in the batter. Don't be shy about coating them, it makes the batter stick when in oil. I also used twice the amount of salt because...hey, it's the fair. Now, if I could only figure out how to replicate Sweet Martha's cookies...",

The batch I didn't freeze, was very messy, stuck to the bottom of the basket and all the cheese oozed out. I also sprinkled Cajun seasoning over a few. Yum! Here are the steps I used:\nI brought the curds to room temp. Lightly rolled them in flour right before I battered them. Placed them on a wax paper-lined cookie sheet. Froze them for 40 min. Put them in the fryer basket and lowered the basket into hot oil. I just kept my eye on them and when they were golden brown, took them out. PERFECT! Dip in pizza sauce!",

Original recipe is very good as is but if you would like more kick to it following is a suggestion. 1 TSP of cayenne 1 TSP of black pepper 1 TBS of paprika 1 TBS of garlic powder Now this may seem like very spicy but really it is not other than just a nice kick. It may be because the batter is only a thin coat and you dont pick up that much spices. Next time we will try with cajun spices. Enjoy",
