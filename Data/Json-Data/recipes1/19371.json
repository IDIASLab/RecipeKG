I didn't even have a pan for it, so I picked one up at Kroger's for like $8. It worked out great. I cooked it for 1 hour 30 minutes, and like Kathy F. Suggested, I left the flan in the roasting pan 10 minutes 1st and then put it on a wire rack to cool an additional 15 minutes before transferring it to a plate. It's going to work out nicely for my dinner party tomorrow night. ;)",

Only had to bake it for 1 hour and 25 min, I let it sit in the hot water after I took it out of oven for another 10 min like I do when making regular flan. I then transferred the bunt pan to a wire rack let cool for about 15 min then inverted. I made this for a picnic we were having the next day so letting it cool and sit overnight worked perfect for me. I bought a foil roasting pan to hold the water and the bunt pan worked out perfect. You wont be disappointed in this flan cake !!",

(Party-pooper! A good recipe is MEANT to be shared!) The reviews on this recipe here looked outstanding so I gave it a whirl! I must admit initially I thought two hours (is that possibly a typo on the recipe-provider's part? Two hours???) seemed like a really long time to back a cake and not over-bake it so I monitored it closely while I was baking mine. I don't know if different oven heating/bake times can vary THAT much that everyone here seems to have such differing results...but after one hour mine was done toothpick came out with just a few crumbs on it and I can't imagine letting the cake go another 30 minutes let alone another hour without ruining the whole thing! So my only caution would be for you to watch your cake closely the first time you make it to see what your oven's bake time will be on it. On hour was perfect for mine. I also did the 10 minutes continued sitting in the hot water after taking out of the oven and an additional 15 minutes on a wire rack as others suggested here before inverting the cake onto a plate. Then I immediately put it int he fridge to chill. The caramel absorbs into the cake and voila! The cake was perfection! Took it to a gathering and it was a total hit!:)",

                "reviewBody": "This cake is fantastic almost exactly how the directions say to do it. People that are saying it's done in an hour...I just don't see how they're getting the flan cooked through at 350?  Maybe they don't realize their flan isn't cooked like it should be. Bake it for 2 hours exactly like the recipe says to do! The key is that water at 2\". Get your ruler out! If you put your cake pan in a roasting pan (I used the roasting pan we use for our turkey during Thanksgiving) 2\" of water will actually be enough, so that the cake pan floats in the water. It's almost impossible to burn something at 350 when it's floating in water. That nice slow bake makes everything turn out PERFECT in texture. Don't skimp on the time!\n\nOne other key is to make sure you pour everything slow into the cake pan and evenly distribute it. If you pour to fast or everything in one spot it won't settle like it should to get that nice separation.\n\nThe only change I made to the recipe was I used Cajeta instead of Caramel sauce. It's like a Mexican caramel made from goats milk that can usually be found at most major grocery stores. I highly recommend it instead of the smuckers for that legitimate Mexican feel!",
