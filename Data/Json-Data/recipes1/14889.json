I cut back the sugar by half (I used 2 tablespoons) because I don't like them that sweet and it was just enough to enhance the corn.

The fritters turned out perfectly light and fluffy! I also thought the ratio of salt to sugar was right for the average person's taste. So this was my take on it: I minced the onion and green onion together with a stick of celery (keep in mind I made a double batch) for a little extra homey rich flavor and about a third of a poblano pepper. I'm not all that into spicy things but it added a little somethin' to the recipe. I also folded in frozen corn. Last unless you're a deep frying pro I would suggest using an icecream scoop to release and drop the batter quickly into the oil. Using a spoon didn't work well because it just kinda dribbled in little by little cooking unevenly and making my hush puppies look a mess!",
