Make sure you have enough anise extract - 1 oz. is only 2 1/2 Tbsp. so you need two small bottles of it if you make the entire recipe. Another thing - if you have a small pizzelle maker like mine cut the recipe in half. I ended up tossing some of my batter because I just would never eat that many. I probably made about 80 or 100 and could have made 50 more.",
