We moved and I could no longer find sausage without additives.\n\nEven if you *can* eat commercial sausage, DON'T - make this and you'll never make anything else!!!  I used 1/2 ground pork and 1/2 fresh ground turkey (better texture than frozen).  This cuts the fat content, and it's still so great!  I made the recipe as stated, but next time I'll cut down on the sage and increase the red pepper to our own liking.  My family doesn't want to eat anything else now!  The first Sunday I cooked the sausage for breakfast, my husband said he just kept thinking about how good it was all during church service!\n\nIf you haven't tried Lee Fogle's Italian Sausage recipe - YOU MUST!  It's also fantastic!  THANK YOU!!!!",

Cut out rounds with a three inch biscuit cutter.  Reroll and cut out until only a few scraps are left.  It made 18 rounds with some scraps for tasting. Oh Yum!",

I didn't have marjoram or cloves and all I had was some ground sage and the Italian Spices (which contained a bit of rosemary, marjoram, sage etc) So I improved with 1 1/2 tsp of ground sage and 1 tsp of the Italian Spices.  I thought it was a bit too sweet (even though I like sweet sausages).  Although I think that the sausage tastes better after a few days in the freezer then cooked. I definitely recommend this recipe but I'd give it a 2-3 days in the freezer to set (just make sure to make it into patties before you freeze it, makes a better of a time than defrosing a hunk of meat.) But overall Great recipe Lee!  Thank you very much for sharing it ^_^",

                "reviewBody": "This is a great basic recipe. I usually mix 1/2 lean ground turkey and 1/2 ground pork. This helps to cut some calories while still giving the flavor we want. I've made several varieties of this sausage by adding different herbs, both fresh and dried to change it up a bit, sometimes cutting back or eliminating the sugar, depending on what I'm using it for. I find my family likes a sweeter sausage for breakfast but more savory for other dishes.   I've also used this basic recipe to make mild Italian sausage without fennel seeds. Most Italian sausage on the market is Sicilian style, heavy with fennel flavor and not what I like or use to, being from a Northern Italian family. I just add fresh basil, dried Italian seasoning, granulated garlic, onion powder, sage and marjoram, and eliminate the red pepper flakes, cloves and brown sugar for an Italian style sausage that is just delicious. You can also add some sun dried tomatoes for a fruitier flavor. Also, to the person who felt the seasoning wasn't blended thruout the meat, an easy fix for that is to spread the meat against and up the sides of the bowl with a fork, spreading it out as much as possible, almost forming a well in the center. Then sprinkle your seasoning mix evenly over the spread out meat. Then mix together and you will have a more even flavor.",
