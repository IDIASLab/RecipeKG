I never added fresh cabbage or used the fatback (salt pork). This is the best recipe I've ever tried -- and our whole family loved it! I was afraid that there wouldn't be enough liquid after draining the kraut but the cabbage and kraut made their own liquid. The result is flavors that are much more intense than with boiling in water alone. One other comment -- this is salty! I love it that way but some people may prefer it a bit less salty. Perhaps rinsing one of the bags of sauerkraut may tone it down. This is a keeper in our family cookbook!",

I put the sliced kielbasa on top and simmered it for about 5 minutes.  Mixed it all together, and then covered it and simmered it for about 40 minutes more.  I served it with spicy brown mustard and rye bread.  Yum.",
