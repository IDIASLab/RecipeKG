I added about a cup more broth than called for (and it made just enough for 3 adults and 2 kids as the main course of dinner).  I also used Neufchatel cheese, and was afraid it wouldn't work, but it did.  It was actually very thin until I added the cheese, and I was worried.  At first, the cheese broke up into little chunks, but I wisked it really well and it worked fine.  I don't use canned corn so I used 3 cups frozen (a mix of white and yellow).  I used garlic powder and just a sprinkle of the garlic salt.  Served with crackers and a nice green salad.",

I did use no sodium broth and fresh corn instead of canned. I am glad I did because, with the added garlic salt, this would have been way too salty. I ended up using corn from 4 cobs for the 2 12oz cans. I subbed 1 Tblsp. of dry parsley for the parsley and it worked fine and just did a pinch or so of black pepper, as I don't really care for it. I tasted it and thought it was missing something and a little too thin. I ended up adding a Tblsp. more of flour, and whisking that in, and chopping up a couple of sprigs of green onion and adding that also. It much improved the taste and texture. I had no bacon like a lot of the other corn soups and chowders tend to use as garnish, etc. but we did sprinkle it with a cheese blend. It was filling tonight and quick for what I had in the house.",
