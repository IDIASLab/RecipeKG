I used canned crab and canned shrimp and used some of the liquid from each can together with the mayo and slightly more sour cream. The bread breaks down to a texture that seems like flaked crab (almost like a moist stuffing texture) The onions egg and celery complete the flavors. This was great to make for my ladies luncheon. I had 20 ladies but didn't want to spend that much money on seafood. This was the perfect solution. Thanks Audrie!",
