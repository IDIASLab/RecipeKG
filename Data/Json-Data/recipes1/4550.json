Some mentioned that their bread turned green, the reason the bread turns green is if the berries are added at the beginning of the bread cycle, you must wait till the second rise cycle (the normal time for additions such as nuts, raisins, etc, to be added.)  I thought the bread was fine, but my husband (who is a little finicky) requested some alterations and WOWOWOWOWOW did it turn out great!  In lieu of wheat gluten, I used a total of 3 tablespoons of bread yeast.  I also used butter instead of oil, added an additional 1/2 tsp of salt, increased the sugar to 4 Tbsp, increased my berry amount to nearly 1 cup, AND.... I added a few drops of coconut extract and vanilla extract. ... We now call it \"Oh My God , Bread\".  Happy Baking!!",

I also used regular milk and lemon juice since I didn't have any buttermilk. I didn't have any problem with the loaf rising and the texture was great. Some of the blueberries got chewed up in the kneading which gave the bread a green color so my toddlers wouldn't touch it (more for me!) but there were still whole blueberries in every bite and the loaf had a good flavor. I ate it right out of the machine with butter this morning and am looking forward to toasting some with butter or cream cheese later. I did have to add a good bit of flour during the second knead to get the dough to form a good ball but the end result was great...I'll definitely be making this one again!",

I am not familiar to making bread with added wheat gluten so not sure if that contributed to that. It is not a very tall loaf either and I assume the recipe was also maybe intended for the older machines that made smaller loaves. I accidentally added the dry fruit at the beginning and not at the beep. As a result the dough was blue however the final result was a normal looking loaf. After this first knead and before the first rise most of the dough seemed to be on one side of the machine due to its density. I gently flattened it some to continue the rest of the process and it baked more evenly. My only ingredient change was souring milk for the buttermilk. I think that worked fine. I also realized I purchased blueberry juice infused cranberries instead of blueberries and that also worked okay. While baking it smelled like a toasted blueberry bagel. It was a little too dense of a bread and a little trial and error so not a repeat recipe. However I liked trying a different flavor of bread. I sliced it with my bread slicer to have for toast on some mornings.",
