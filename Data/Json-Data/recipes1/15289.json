It becomes more like a soup if you add 2 c. water with the boullion cubes.  Also, a way to make the soup even simpler to make is to add one cup of uncooked rice along with the other ingredients in step 3.  That way it can just cook up with everything else during the simmer.  This works great for us.",

It was way too sweet for our taste. I then came back and read all the reviews and made changes and would give it 5 stars with the changes. I added another pepper, used can beef broth, used a combination of crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes and tomate sauce (my kids don't like too many chunky tomatoes in anything). I also eliminated the sugar, used worcestshire sauce instead of soy, halfed the pepper and added italian seasoning and garlic powder. This was awesome and will make again.",

I used ground turkey (a little over a pound) added an onion chopped while the meat was cooking along with 3 cloves of garlic minced.  I used 2 very large peppers, One green and one half red and half green. ( I was surprised the recipe only called for 1).  I used beef broth in place of cubes and I cut back on the brown sugar.  I also added a can of tomato soup and 3 bay leaves.  The Bay is something that MY mother and grandmother always used in stuffed peppers.  That made the soup.  As is 4 stars but with changes way over 5.  Thanks for the good soup!!",

It is a touch on the salty side so I may reduce either the salt and soy sauce or omit one ingrediant altogther. I can't wait to make this during the dead cold of winter!! Thanks Holly!",
