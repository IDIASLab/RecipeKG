The beans got WAY overcooked and all in all there was no flavor for all of the extent and steps this recipe called for. I could go into all of the changes I made to salvage this but I'll spare you the detail. The hocks were void of any flavor once they had been boiled down so to add the little bit of meat you get back to the pot was for color and texture only because the meat had no flavor. Sorry to do this but as written I can only give this 2.",
