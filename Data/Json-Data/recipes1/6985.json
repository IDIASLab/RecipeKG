Because 5 serrano peppers is INSANE and I wanted to make sure others knew that before they prepared this.  Not knowing anything about serrano peppers, we lost all sensation in our heads when we ate this salsa for the first time.  And believe me, we eat habaneros every day so we know hot.  Perhaps you are not supposed to use the seeds, but the recipe doesn't say that.  In any event, we have found that 1 and 1/2 serranos is fine when using the whole pepper.  If you have something to prove, try 2.  :-)",

Tomatoes from the garden are best but romas from the store work well also. I used a hothouse variety from the store the second time I made this and they were mealy. Beware that this salsa makes a lot of liquid in the bowl. If you like it great if not use in a soup or on veggies. THIS RECIPE DOESN'T NEED 5 CHILIS. I USED 1 SERRANO CHILI AND GOT PLENTY OF HEAT FROM THAT. TASTE YOUR SALSA AS YOU ADD CHILIS TO GET A COMFORTABLE HEAT LEVEL. Also, your heat level will go up or down depending on how cold your salsa is. ",
