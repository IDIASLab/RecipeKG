My 1st impression was that it was that there was too much oil as well BUT after letting it cool 100% over night it tastes much better and you dont taste the oil as much as trying it say 30 min. after it comes out of the oven. A smidgen sweet for me but im not a sugar person and I dont think you can really cut back that much? if anyone attempts withs a little less sugar I could love to know how it compares.",
