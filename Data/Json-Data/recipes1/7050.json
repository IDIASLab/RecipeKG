I think next time though I will mix the noodles in with the sauce before serving as the noodles seemed a little dry and bland with it just served over the top. I used a brandy we bought at a winery in Michigan that was made from their grapes. What wonderful flavors! We topped it off with fresh-grated parmesan cheese and served with salad homemade bread and a bottle of Virginia chardonnay. Thank you!",

This dish is a mess for most of its very fast pretparation and then it comes together all at once! I used scallops and shrimp. I also substituted Gran Marnier for cognac. The subtle orange flavor was very good. Use a good strong Hungarian Paprika. Thanks Holly for a great one! Dan",

I also used vadalia onion rather than scallions. The end result was wonderful. The second time preparing it I used angel hair pasta rather than fettucine. We prefered the Angel Hair pasta to fettucine. Regardless of the changes the recipe is awesome. I will continue to enjoy this one!!! Thanks Holly for a great recipe!",
