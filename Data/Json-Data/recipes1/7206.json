Added almost a full garlic (minced) per bag generous oregano garlic salt & black pepper & 3-4 shakes of the sauces--on each. Put the seasonings on everything not just the chops. Also sliced the onions (added lots) rather than diced. Cut the potatoes in small quarter sizes & put in 2 corn pieces (no more than 2 inches long). Baked at 350 for almost 90 minutes--had thick no bone chops. IT WAS PERFECT! No mess no drips and no clean up. Absolutely fabulous!!!",

Recommendations: Place the chops directly on the foil it absorbs the flavoring and browns delicious. Cook it at a higher temperature I boosted it up to 375 for the second 45 minutes. Consider substituting the corn (cooks fastest) with something that won't dry out with the longer cooking time (I'm trying beans and potatoes next time). And lastly CUT THE POTATOES SMALL. After 1.5 hours the small ones were so tasty and perfect.",

I did alter the recipe a bit based on the previous reviews and what was in my kitchen. I cut the potatoes smaller than recommended in the original recipe and I used three different types of potatoes (red potatoes white potatoes and yellow buttery potatoes) to get a range of taste. I did not have Worcestershire sauce so I used lemon juice. I put a tablespoon of each of the following items in each foil packet: soy sauce lemon juice and water. For dry spices I used garlic salt oregano lemon pepper and black pepper. I also added carrots to the foil packet. My husband and I both enjoyed it. The one other thing I will probably change in the future is to remove the breadcrumbs. To me they did not seem to add anything to the recipe.",
