Because we don;t eat grains I made some substitutions: I used almond meal instead of bread crumbs and coconut flour instead of all-purpose - the amount may need to be adjusted because the meatball mixture was quite soupy. BUT I just added it in by the tablespoon full and because the soup was boiling at the time it made meatballs - yay for physics! I also adjusted the spices - I didn't have the ones suggested so I used an Italian seasoning mix and it was still absolutely fabulous. Oh and also because I had some beef stock I needed to use up I used it instead of straight water - 3 cups stock plus 5 cups water. Man alive such a flavourful soup - I will definitely use this recipe in the future.",
