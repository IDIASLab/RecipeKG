I doubled the recipe, and in place of the carrots, I added one large can of corn.  I used half butter and half olive oil instead of all margarine.  I replaced the whole milk with skim milk and a small can of part-skim evaporated milk.  I also left out the mustard powder, allspice, seasoning salt, cayenne pepper, and chicken boullion, replaced the celery seed with celery salt, and added some freshly ground pepper.  One might argue that what I made is a completely different recipe, but this existing recipe made a great jumping-off point, and the resulting soup (or chowder, as I would call it) was still very flavorful.  It would make a fantastic chowder to which to add haddock or another fish for a flavorful fish chowder.  Another reviewer mentioned that this was a very thick soup - in doubling the recipe, I used a little less than twice the amount of flour called for, and the skim milk also thinned it a bit.  I also cooked it for a little less than the recommended amount of time in order to keep the potatos firm, and didn't break them up with my spoon.  Overall, a fantastic chowder!",

What I did differently:  I used butter instead of margarine.  I also did not use any of the following:  parsley, allspice, celery seed, dried thyme,  cayenee nor the chicken bullion.  This is a thick soup and I'm glad I only used 2 large potatoes instead of 3.  This is a great soup and I easily can see myself adding broccoli and other leftover veggies next time.  It thickens up a little bit more after you put it in the fridge, if you don't like thick soup, when you reheat it, just add a scant 1/4 cup chicken stock or milk.  GREAT and I look foward to making this again!",
