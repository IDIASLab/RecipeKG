I vary the recipe by using different extracts in the frosting.  I have made it with lemon, almond and vanilla.  The cookies are tender.  I use a cookie sheet without sides in order to slide them off. Don't handle them too much just after baking.  They are best to make a day ahead as they firm up after being frosted (keep them in the fridge.) They truely melt in your mouth.  The frosting is a must with the cookie.  I use a pastry bag to pipe the frosting into the thumbprint. Yummy!  Try it!",

I was looking under \"thumbprints\" and kept coming across nut cookies with jam frosting. = ( I did a key word search and found these! Soooooo happy. My husband has never had them and has nearly ate the whole batch in one day. Thank you so much! I did bake them on parchment paper. This way I could lift them up to see if they were starting to brown on the bottom. When they were just starting to brown on the bottom they were done and still not at all brown on the top side. I also used a floured tablespoon measure to make the dough balls to ensure a uniform size. I ended up with exactly 24 cookies as the recipe states. Delicious!",
