It came out crispy on the outside and just right on the inside.",

The fish would have turned out better if the fish was fried instead of baked.  If I make it again I will definitely need to add more seasoning and use bread crumbs instead of flour.  I use the same ingredients, substitute the flour for breadcrumbs, on chicken breast.  It is really good.  The breadcrumbs give the fish or chicken a crispier crust than the flour does.",

I seasoned the catfish with a bit of salt garlic and black pepper before dipping into the egg. For the flour/cheese mixture I didn't use any flour at all I subsituted the flour with seasoned bread crumbs and I added cayenne pepper to the mixture. I baked it in the oven for about 35 minutes then put it in the broiler for another 5 minutes for crispiness. Once crispy I spread some shredded cheddar cheese on top of the filets and left it in the oven(not broiler again) for a couple of minutes until the cheddar was melted. It was perfect!! My husband had seconds and leftovers for lunch the next day. He said this is one of his favorites now. Thanks!!!",

I also used cheddar and not parmesan and allowed it to bake for 30 minutes and it tasted great. However next time I will dip the fish in egg first then flour then egg and breadcrumbs. In that way I'll get more to stick to the fish.",
