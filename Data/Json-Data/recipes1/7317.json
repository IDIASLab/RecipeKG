I halfed those and should not have because those are probably what makes the sauce thin enough to fill the holes well.  2) I should have made more holes. 3) I should have made the holes BIGGER!  I did use only a 12 oz pkg. of milk chocolate chips, and do not regret that.  It was yummy and went well with ice cream.",

And I have to give this a \"5 star\" rating. It may not be the fanciest cake ever. But it taste really good. It's very easy to make and you probably already have the ingredients on hand. Do make the holes plenty big and make sure the cake is right out of the oven when you put the chocolate mixture on. I just kept going over the cake with the spatula and the filling was pushed into the holes. I baked the cake in a glass pan so I could check it at the bottom. The semi-sweet chocolate is very rich. If you're not a chocolate lover you may prefer to use milk chocolate chips. Please try.",
