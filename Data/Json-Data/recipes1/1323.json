As a cake decorator, I've made this cake countless times over the years.  It is dense and rich.  Used it in wedding cakes and it perfect for 3D cakes. It is delicious.  I love the flavor. I usually make this cake without the frosting following the cake recipe exactly. Sometimes, I'll add different flavors: ground almond (about 1/2-3/4 cup) and almond extract instead of vanilla or lemon zest(about 3-4 lemons) with lemon extract.  Tried adding cocoa one time and that didn't come out that great.  It is delicious with a chocolate buttercream frosting.  Give it a try...",
