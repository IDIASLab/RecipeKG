This recipe really brings back memories of yummy Frito Pie - back in the 70's you could get a great one at Sonic Drive In's in the South.. but no longer they are horrible. You can also pop openan individual bag of corn chips dump some chili right in the bag and put your toppings on for a \"Walking Taco\". They are a big hit at kids birthday parties. LOL I always made Frito Pie on Halloween Night - quick easy and got the kids out the door FAST! Thanks for the memories. Now I'm getting hungry.",

You will have two textures softer fritos and crunchy...add whatever you like sour cream onions different cheeses tomatoes even green chilli.......just great!
