I mention that because my sister-in-law wasn't too fond of the \"Mad Dog\" idea because of the high fat content. So, we compromised: Regular hotdogs, reduced fat cheese and (preheated) turkey bacon. They cooked up nicely with a lot less grease.\r\n**Here's my twist on it though: I wrapped them in cresent rolls before baking, as my mother used to do. We then used our condiments as a dipping sauce rather then a topping. (I wrapped mine with chopped onions inside) :-)\r\nThe kids definatly loved to help make & eat these (as did my brother) & we'll make them again!",

It could be because i used thicker bacon, maybe next will use regular bacon.  I did put it under the broiler for a few minutes and that did help but not to my moms liking but she likes her bacon really crispy.  Diffinitely will do this again. thanks",
