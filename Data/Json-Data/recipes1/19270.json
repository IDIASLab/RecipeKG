I made just as directed: butter, 10 chopped fun-size bars (I think that's about the same amount? I don't buy the bites) and natural creamy peanut butter. Very sweet but oh-so-good. I don't see how anyone could have a problem with these bars but I am the first review: hopefully these stay five-star because they really did blow my family away with the peanut-chocolately simplicity. Thanks so much for sharing!",
