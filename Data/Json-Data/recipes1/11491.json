Only thing I did  different is that I cut onions (1/2 in.cut thick, they shrink), soaked in coldwater while I was doing everything else. Dusted in flour or bisquik, in a ziplock...then into the batter! Batter should foam abit before you use, beer and flour combo makes bubbles! Absolutely picture perfect onion rings! I would have taken a pic but...I ate them! Freezing about a dozen to see if they will work frozen....",
