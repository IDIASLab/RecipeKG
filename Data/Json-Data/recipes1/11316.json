The 4 ingredients were things that I always have on hand and it was oh so delicious and easy to make! We loved it! It was NOT sour and NOT runny. However if you are one who likes it thicker chilling it thickens it up a good bit. We like it both ways. I had some left over and the next day I added a couple tablespoons of peanut butter to it and that was yummy also and made it thicker. I will use this one again and again. Thanks for sharing!",
