Therefore, I cooked it in a pan with the potatoes and didn't need to use any olive oil.  I also didn't have the tiny muffin tins so I used regular sized ones.  And, I didn't have the right cheese -- I only had farmer's cheese oacked in brine.  Since the cheese was in brine, I didn't use any salt and since the chorizo was really hot, I didn't add any cayenne pepper.  It turned out fabulously and I increased the cooking time to 20 minutes to allow for the larger muffin tins.  For garnish, I mixed avocado, tomatoes, garlic, lemon juice, green onion and salt together and served it with sour cream as well.  AMAZING!",

I had some vegetarian chorizo in the freezer, not completely knowing what I was going to make, then I saw this recipe and thought it would make a wonderful brunch dish along with a French toast bake from this site also.  I opted to use regular size cupcake pan for more of a meal. But the appetizer size would be the perfect party treat.  The only ingredient I added was a little chopped onion, cooked with the chorizo and a meal we had.  This recipe is extremely versatile, which added to it appeal. Try and stay close to baking times. Eggs have a tendency to dry out and become tough when over cooked.",
