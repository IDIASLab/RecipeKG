Then I melted the chocolate. When the caramel was hardened, I dipped each piece into the chocolate, totally covering each piece. I put them back onto parchment paper and they came out great! They come easily off the parchment paper when cooled.",

Second once you see that the caramels are softening up after heating them push them into the nut you are use gently then put them in the oven again for about five more minutes. This helps greatly because then you aren't baking the caramels just melting them. Also I covered them all the way with chocolate. There were great the second time around.",
