I worried it would be oversweet but it really wasn't though I might try it with less sugar in the icing next time so it will have more cream cheese taste. This was one of the moistest cakes I've ever eaten; I think that's because of the sour cream and coconut cream in the batter. (I used light sour cream.) My icing turned out a little runny but I think that also added to the moistness and it was kind of nice the way it dripped over the sides. This is a fabulous white cake and I will make it again.",
