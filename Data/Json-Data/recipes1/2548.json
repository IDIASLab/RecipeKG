I also am a big fan of the dough-cycle on my bread maker so I made it this way and with the extra water and a dash of olive oil it came out perfect! I do feel like this recipe should give a little more guidance as to time- on the second rise and the first bake specifically. I found them to be 30 minutes and 10 minutes respectively. I also slid the pizza onto a broiling pan for the last 15 minutes of cooking to get a nice crispy bottom. I will definitely use this recipe again.",

Yeasty flavor crispy outside chewy inside. This crust has a great texture and made a nice thick crust which browned beautifully; it held up to the toppings I heaped on it and wasn't at all doughy. Prebaking it is absolutely inspired and I think it made all the difference in the end product. This recipe may be a little more work than others at but in my estimation it's worth it.",
