Dissolve cornstarch in water- bring to a boil then remove from heat. Beat egg whites and cream of tarter on high with whisk attachment until foamy. Add sugar while beating constantly. Thoroughly beat in corn starch paste and then vanilla. The mixture should stand in soft peaks. Add to top of pie immediately. SO Tasty!",
