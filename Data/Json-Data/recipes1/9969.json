I mean this is cutting it close....I thought the brownies were heavenly and so did all my husbands workers. (I use them to taste test my baking) I have a slight problem with semisweet chips...I always use milk chocolate And I think milk choc. chips would have taken these up a level. I think it was great and it will be given as gifts this year! Mary",
