Still gets 5 stars b/c it's good.  I made it in the bread machine on the wheat setting, medium crust, 2# setting and it was a little dark.  Next time I'll try the 1.5# setting and light crust.",

It makes wonderful toast and mine sliced beautifully for sandwiches contrary to what another rater said (she probably did not knead the dough enough which will make it crumbly). I like to leave the raisins a little speckled in the bread - too much processing and they disappear. The sweetness causes the top to become a bit dark but otherwise I love this bread!
