I also used organic begetable broth instead of chicken.  I used celery salt and a pinch of tumeric and coriander. I only added 1/2 cup milk and some fillini soup pasta.  It was a hit and was very much like many of the soups we had in Jamaica and the Caribbean.",

I used 2t cumin the recc amt of celery seed (would up it next time) used some coriander and some curry. IMO it still needed a lot of flavor. I cooked it at 3hrs on High and then an additional 30 minutes more after the addition to the milk. I think that the 8-10 hours on Low is WAY too long especially for the broccoli which was most likely the contributing factor to the bitterness that people were complaining about. I think that 3 hrs MAX on High should be plenty. I'll try it one more time because it was easy enough to make (prep took 20 minutes from start to finish) and nutritious with the variety of vegetables but it wasn't one of DH's favorites. Picky 3yo DD ate it all though which warrants 4 stars for me.",
