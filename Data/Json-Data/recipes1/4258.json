The long simmer really is essential to concentrate the tomato flavors; I simmered mine for five hours (just because it was more convenient) and honestly I'd recommend at least four. After three I thought the tomatoes were still a little sharp. My two biggest concerns going in were the oil and the crushed red pepper; I was afraid there'd be too much oil and too little chili. Wrong on both counts. I made the full recipe and will be happy to freeze it to use for another three meals. Thanks!",
