They were all scooping out seconds of this salad! Couldn't believe my eyes! There's no fresh pimento available where I live so I used chopped sweet red pepper but otherwise followed the recipe exactly as stated. I don't think anyone guessed there was pineapple in it and not everyone likes pineapple. The overall taste is a creamy-nutty-crunchy experience. Delicious! The color ended a creamy peach. I did make it a day ahead of time and wonderment it came out of the mold beautifully. This recipe is a MUST TRY!",
