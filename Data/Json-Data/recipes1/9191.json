The Polish name for these cabbage rolls \"golabki \" means \"pigeons\" (because they resemble a pigeon breast). As a kid I had qualms about eating them because of this:) Now they're just delicious. I suggest looking on youtube for tutorials on how to roll the cabbage (works best if you cut a triangle into the base of the leaf so it's more pliable). Smacznego!",

I guess I altered it quite a bit. My husband and I ate it for 3 days and have craved it since Will be trying to duplicate it tonight. it is a lot of work and messy though! would give five stars but it needs more meat.",
