I also seasoned with a sprinkle of garlic powder seasoned salt and black pepper. After making the dish I then thought instead of adding the dry seasonings one could dash the recipe with a little worcestershire. Whatever way you choose to make this recipe keep in mind that it's very good on it's own so it does not need more than a sprinkle of seasonings. We will definitely make this again!!",

It is so easy because there is not a lot of work to put into it and it can cook in the microwave while you are preparing other dishes. However we use a different variation of this recipe.. 1.) Melt the butter in the microwave by itself. 2.) Then add the rice. 3.) Pour 1 can of french onion soup & 1 can of beef consomme on top of rice- Do not stir! 4.) Cook for 20 minutes. Then stir it up and put it back in the microwave for 5-10 more minutes to make sure the rice is fully cooked. You will LOVE this recipe!",

The casserole was literally swimming in butter.",
