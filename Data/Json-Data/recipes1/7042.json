Before I cooked the eggplant I laid out the slices on paper towels and sprinkled them with some salt, to help release moisture, for a few minutes.    After they were cooked, I laid a piece of prosciutto on it, then the ricotta mixture (to which I added some parmesan and mozzarella), then rolled it up and secured it with a toothpick.   I put them on a platter with a small bowl of the tomato sauce in the middle.  This way, it was a neat appetizer and people could dip or spoon the tomato sauce on if they wanted it.  \nIt turned out very tasty and I will probably make it again with the same adjustments.",
