                "reviewBody": "I tried it the first time 'as is,' which I believe is necessary when reviewing a recipe. They were fine but browned too fast and were chewy. Based on that and other people's reviews, I made the following adjustments: a) only 1 tbl of sugar in the dough (cuts the browning); b) only 1 tbl of oil in the dough (cuts the chewiness). It should be noted that you only need to mix dry with wet for 30 sec. I also used a churreria, which ensures the right thickness and was brilliant. Made these finger sized with only 5 in the pan at a time - putting too many in the pan lowers the temp of the oil & will cause you to cook them long after they're brown or remove them while still raw. Take them out to drain, put the next batch in the fryer and shake the cooling (now warm not hot) ones in a paper bag with the sugar and cinnamon; a second person is not needed. I would recommend doubling the recipe for anyone wanting to serve more than 2-3 people without having to double the sugar/cinnamon coating. Halve the sugar/cinna mix if only making one batch. Real churros in Spain are not light and fluffy; they're like this. All in all, a good recipe. :)",

I used a wilton #25 but need one a bit bigger. You must work quickly as the dough will go cement quickly. Also be sure to wash up your bowl and dough tools ASAP.",

I had to double bag mine in order for the batter to not melt through.  I agree with others that it's better to pipe all of them on parchment paper, and then just add them to the oil a few at a time.  Piping them directly into the oil did not work for me.  I immediately rolled them in the cinnamon sugar mixture to make sure it stuck and they were well coated.  My kids were so thrilled.
