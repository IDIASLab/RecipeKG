It's nearly identical to how I make chicken curry. The only difference is that I chop up my own tomato, and use less. Also, I've read that some people put green or red bell peppers in their jalfrezis.  \"Jalfrezi\" incidentally means \"dry fry\" - the intention is to have a very thick gravy that coats the chicken nicely, as opposed to having a very liquidy sauce. But I guess you can make it whichever way you think tastes better! Oh, and by the way, Indian curries usually don't have \"curry powder\" in them. It's a common misconception. Happy eating!",

I just chopped onion fine, crushed my garlic with my garlic press, and grated my ginger.  I like heat so I added something similar to cayenne but one could use red pepper flakes if wanting to kick it up a bit.  I added about 1/3 cup chicken broth when adding the chicken to the pan.  I threw in about 1/2 cup chick peas with the tomatoes.  I think adding the broth helped it not be too dry. I served this over basmati rice with peas thrown into the rice.  Very nice easy meal.  This is really a great staple recipe for those of us that have just about every type of spice there is.  I didn't have to run out for any of the ingredients!",

I will definitely make it again.  \r\n\r\nChanges I made: \r\n\r\nI used thinly sliced onions, minced garlic, and finely grated ginger instead of pulverizing them all together.  I fried the onions (along with 4 WHOLE cardamom pods, 4 WHOLE cloves, the cinnamon stick and the bay leaves) until deep golden brown, and then added the garlic and the ginger.  \r\n\r\nNote: In my opinion, the success of recipes like this depends on the quality of the chicken.  If the chicken is old and tough, your dining pleasure will be diminished :) I've noticed that these packages of boneless, skinless thighs are often seem to contain chicken of inferior quality.  This recipe would be just as good in my opinion if a good, whole, fresh chicken were cut up into pieces...with the bone left in.",

Regarding ingredients I skipped the food processing instead just cut the onions really really small. I also used one can of diced peeled tomatoes (because I couldn't find crushed in the right size) and squashed/crushed them myself. Finally I used 4-5 chicken breasts pressed/cut thinly. Regarding cooking/serving I cooked (step three) for 45 minutes covered then noticed how liquidy the sauce was and then for 45 minutes uncovered. The sauce boiled down to a nice thick very flavorful paste. There wasn't enough sauce to serve this over rice or put extra sauce on rice but the sauce amply covered the chicken and was great. Some reviewers commented that this dish should be mixed with / served with something else like potatoes. So I served it alongside the Aloo Phujia (potatoes onions and tomatoes) recipe from this site and that pair worked very well together.",

This took very little time to make and it produced a great meal. I was tempted to add curry powder to this but didn't because no other reviewer had attempted to do so. I didn't add the cardamom or cloves because I didn't have either one. I did add a bit more salt to my liking. Abby (my 14 month old baby girl) gobbled hers up and my hubby said he liked it as well.
