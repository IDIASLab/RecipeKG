                "reviewBody": "The ingredients are just right. For inexperienced cooks, a few suggestions: while the water in the double boiler is heating, don't place the top pan over the water yet. Mix the sugar, salt and cornstarch together in a bowl, add milk and eggs. Beat all together, pour into the room-temperature top part of double boiler. When water is boiling, lower to a simmer, and place top pan over water. This method prevents lumps, and keeps pudding from sticking to pan. We also like to top the pudding with a bit of whipped cream. Thanks for a great recipe, Sue.",

I have found that this recipe can be doubled for taking to a dinner party.  Also everyone who has tried it raves about how good it is and how it is the best tasting 'nana puddin' they have had in a while.  \r\n\r\nOne thing that I have found improves the flavor greatly is to use more vanilla and also to use butter instead of margarine.  \r\nThanks again for the great recipe!",
