The spices are great though I don't understand why they're called pepper cookies as there is barely any pepper nor can I taste the pepper. I will definitely make these again. Modifications: As someone else suggested I added about 1/4 cup additional flour. Also since I hate rolling out dough I rolled the cookies into balls and then flattened them with the bottom of a glass (another helpful suggestion I found here!) However instead of using flour to make the glass not stick I used a bit of water - so that the cookies wouldn't be tougher with added flour. It suggested to bake the cookies for 8-10 minutes I think but I found that about 14 minutes was perfect for me.",

And then I found that after I pulled them out of the refrigerator and baked them (using the drop cookie method) they would come out like flat discs and they were very crispy but tasted great. I have made these cookies many times in high altitudes in low altitudes but I finally found out the trick: do not refrigerate them. After I mixed all the ingredients I decided I wasn't going to wait for the refrigeration. They came out fluffy and cake-like and they still taste amazing. True you do have to use the drop cookie method but they are fantastic. Oh and you can make them as large or as small as you want and they still take about 10 minutes to bake. They do tend to stick to the baking sheet and I'm not sure how to remedy this but I'm sure that there are more talented bakers out there who know the trick! Thanks for the great recipe!",
