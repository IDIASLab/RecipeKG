Add pickles to the smell of it and we're really walking on thin shells. I survived the undertaking and got more adventurous, tossing in some finely chopped green olives, an inner rib of celery, a teaspoon of dijon mustard, and a pinch of freshly cracked pepper. Thanks for the recipe, and grazie for the starting line. Simple, versatile egg salad with a twist or two. Enjoy!",
