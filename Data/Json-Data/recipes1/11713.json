Next time, I would double the cheese and use about 8 oz. of egg noodles.  Another thought would be to eliminate the cream of mushroom soup and velveeta and substitute it with a can of nacho cheese soup instead.  Oh!  And my boyfriend calls this \"Corned Beef Hasherole\"!",

However I'm glad I read the other reviews first because I only used half the noodles and this was perfect. Twice as many would just be WAY too much. I used a combo of American and cheddar cheese which was decent but Velveeta would've been better and I didn't have any. I also did my usual substitution of cream of celery soup since I don't like mushrooms and this usually works well.",
