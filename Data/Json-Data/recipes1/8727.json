First use 1/2\" wooden dowels to make them on that have been cut to 4\" lengths and soaked in oil overnight then blotted before use. This is like tempering a cast iron pan. The cookies should slide off easier. Next add 1 to 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar to the dough. Lastly reduce the amount of Crisco not the butter in the filling and make sure you are not working with it in a hot kitchen the fat will break down easily. And make sure to dust the tops of the cookies with powder sugar when finished and put together. Do not fill the cookies until they are completely cold. These freeze exceptionally well if there are any left to freeze! I have been making these for special occasions for decades and are always the hit of the table.",
