This cake is so good, left such an impression on me,  that I remember the first time I made it in September 1977 as a birthday cake!  It was a showstopper and an incredible hit \u2013 and *I* was proud.   With a full cup of cocoa powder you can expect a deep chocolate flavor, the boiling water only serving to make that flavor bloom!  Four eggs and a full cup of butter tells you the cake will be rich, moist and flavorful (just be very careful not to overbake).  I use the filling from the original recipe, which calls for just 1 cup of cream, not a pint, 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/4 cup of powdered sugar.  I use it only between the layers, not on top.  I also make the original frosting \u2013 melt 1 c. chocolate chips, 1/2 c. half-and-half and 3/4 c. butter in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add 2-1/2 c. powdered sugar, mix well, then place saucepan over a large bowl of ice.  Beat the frosting until it thickens and holds its shape.  Add a little half-and-half if needed to make a desirable spreading consistency.  Try garnishing the cake with chocolate curls and a few strawberries. This is an excellent, reliable, go-to recipe for a great chocolate cake that has stood the test of time!",

I have made it several times now and everyone i mean EVERYONE goes crazy!!! ADD MILK TO THE FROSTING AND IT TURNS OUT PERFECTLY start with 1 Tablespoon and then keep the processor/mixer going and just go a drop at a time until it's at a perfect spreading consistency. You an also add up to 1/4 cup cocoa for a more \"chocolatey\" frosting. truly amazing!!!!",

                "reviewBody": "This is my favorite chocolate cake recipe of all time. I make the cake part exactly to this recipe. I have been making it for 22 years and it is always a very big hit. On the filling my recipe calls for only 1 cup of whipped cream with 1/4 cup powdered sugar but I always wish I had more. I think it has gotten some negative reviews because the frosting is a bit stiff for the cake (which is sticky but so worth it) and tears it. I use a softer frosting (which I think taste better on this cake) that doesn't harden until you refridgerate it which is close to \"Creamy Chocolate Frosting\" SUBMITTED BY: Jeannette Mack. But a few times when I was in a hurry I used a classic chocolate buttercream like the one in this recipe and it was fine. I think once I even used a store bought frosting and no one complained. Because the cake is sticky use two spatulas one for dipping in the frosting and one for spreading to avoid getting crumbs in your frosting. Get plenty of frosting on your spreading spatula and avoid pulling it straight off the cake. Slide the spatula off keeping it level with the cake. Spread the frosting like you would peanut butter on soft bread. This is such a wonderful cake. Don't be scared off! It is so worth the effort.",

This is a really good cake by itself but I felt I wanted a little boost of moisture and chocolate. These added ingredients make it heavy so proceed with caution but so yummy!

They were SO delicious and moist and wonderfully tender... they practically melt in your mouth. I used the recipe to make cupcakes that I hollowed out and filled with chopped reeses mixed with some homemade caramel. Topped with a peanut butter buttercream and garnished with a mini reeses. I wish I wasn't so rushed... I forgot to take a photo! This recipe is a KEEPER!",
