I ended up with a fair amount of it left over (even tho\u2019 the only side I served with it was hot, clarified butter!).  This simple recipe of basically scrambled eggs with lobster meat folded into it came up using the AR ingredient search.  Rather than for its complexity or creativity, it inspired me for a way to make use of the leftovers for our breakfast this morning.  I expanded on this basic recipe to suit our own tastes and give it some complexity.  First, we\u2019re not fans of tarragon, for either its flavor or its boldness, and I think I\u2019d like it even less with lobster. I didn\u2019t want to mask the delicious, sweet flavor of the lobster even a teeny bit, and for us tarragon surely would have done that.   Fresh dill was a much more appealing option for us.  For the same reason I did not add the cayenne.  I could have stopped there, but to make it even more rich, creamy and decadent, I added small cubes of cream cheese at the very end of the cooking process.  Four stars for inspiration, five stars for outstanding taste with some tweaking.",
