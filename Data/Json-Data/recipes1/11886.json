A couple notes: 1.) grease your bowls well; my rolls really stuck to my soup bowls. 2.) in hindsight I don't know if it was worth the effort of using 6 separate soup bowls. It does make the size of the rolls nice and large but I think a muffin pan would be much easier. Overall good recipe though- thanks!",
