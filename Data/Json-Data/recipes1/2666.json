I doubt I'll try another recipe again, this one was perfect!  I added a little more brown sugar, so it was like a dessert.  A little tip is that if you stir in a cup of mini marshmallows before putting this in the baking dish and stir them around a little you have marshmallow surprises throughout the casserole and not just on top.

You could use a little less sugar, but we are used to the sweetness of this recipe with our traditional Thanksgiving dinner.  \r\n\r\nMy absolute favorite part of this recipe is no eggs!  I hate the eggy taste in some casseroles and this one holds together just right with no eggs.  Great for people with allergies too.
