It is a no-bake cookie but in this case that doesn't mean it's not time consuming to prepare.",

Here is what I did.  ...I could not figure out for the life of me why in the world this recipe would need FOUR cups of conf. sugar, and then I figured the reason for that was because it had to sweeten the 6 oz of OJ concentrate.  So instead I only used about 3 oz OJ and only ONE cup of conf sugar and it turned out GREAT!  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as stated, except I added 8 oz of room temp cream cheese.  These were also really good without the OJ in them, just the crushed cookies, cream cheese and the sugar...YUM! Next time I will make them like that and dip them into white chocolate.  Try adding cream cheese, you won't be sorry---just make sure it is room temperature so that it \"folds\" into the cookie crumb mixture well.",
