I have struggled to make a good diner style potato and pepper dish and this is it.  I used a well seasoned cast iron skillet and the potatoes came out perfectly.  The peppers are tender and the onions are golden.  It's fabulous.  Flavor is great and it reminds me of my father-in-law's potatoes. He worked as a cook and makes the BEST breakfasts. Thanks so much for this recipe!",

I cut down on the oil & did a mixture of rosemary garlic and hot pepper infused oils which I sauted the potatoes onions & some fresh thyme in for about 10 mins. I then added a 1/2 c. of chicken stock & put the lid on to allow them to soften up. In a grill pan I roasted the sliced peppers to give them a nice grilled flavor then added them to the potatoes & onions. I seasoned the dish with adobo garlic salt and white pepper to taste. On the grill pan I sauted turkey kielbasa and added it to the veggie mix once it was done. I let all of the ingredients cook for about 5-10 mins more to combine the flavors and it came out awesome! We will be having this again for sure.",

Also put in green pepper in addition to red for color and roast in oven at 400 for about 35-40 min or till potatoes done and turning the mixture once or twice.
