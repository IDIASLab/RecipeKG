I noticed both reviewers said it was bland, and that salt and pepper were missing from the ingredients. So I added kosher salt and pepper, paprika, and thyme to the flour. I also salted the onions and garlic as I was cooking them, and it seemed to be the touch it needed. This was excellent!! My 5 year old loved it!! And he doesn't like anything. :) We are gonna add this to my list of favorites.",

The second time I added seasonings to the flour (rosemary,  thyme, sage, salt & pepper),  used about 1 1/2 times the garlic, replaced the onion with shallots and I added a thinly sliced poblano pepper (before it went bad).  Much more tinkering and it will be a different recipe but I will make this again.",
