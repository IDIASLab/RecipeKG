And the noodles were fantastic.  My family loved this dish, which I served with \"Make Ahead Mashed Potatoes,\" also available at Allrecipes.com.  For me, three cups of flour for the noodles wasn't enough to make the dough workable.  I used something closer to four.  The dough was just too gooey to work with before I added the extra flour.  Even adding all of the extra flour, the noodles were still sticking together.  Next time, I'll let them dry out longer.  I grew up with longer noddles, and made that style, which I cut with a pizza cutter - an fantastic and easy technique.  I saw no real need to strain the celery and carrots with the chicken.  When the chicken was cooked, I just took the pieces out individually, removing meat from the bones, then placed the meat back in the pot - no reason to fiddle around with the straining process.  I've got to say I'm honored to be the first to review this dish - one I will remember well and serve again and again.",

Easy and good or better than homemade, shortcut is to get some homemade style frozen egg noodles and use 1/2 bag, add about 1/2 hour before serving. I also like to make Bisquick dumplings because they thicken the broth just enough and add the ultimate comfort to this food!If your broth is getting low add more water or a can of chicken broth so the dumplings have plenty of liquid to boil in.",

This was a big disapointment.  It was so easy to make that I was forced to spend time with her while she was here.  It did score me points with her because it was so good.\n\nThe only adjustments I made was adding 2 bay leaves, minced garlic, salt, cornstarch, and I used 4 1/2 containers of chicken broth we like more broth) instead of 3. \n\nThe noodles were SUPER easy.  I generously floured the counter and generously floured the top of the dough.  Then I rolled out the dough and cut with a pizza cutter.  Before putting them into the pot I shook off the excess.  I let the noodles dry out a little bit before adding.  It kept them from sticking together.  \n\nI will never eat canned soup again.  This is THE chicken noodle soup recipe for us.",

Definitely use chicken on the bone and both light and dark meat as they add to of the flavor of the broth. I also added a bit more flour to the noodle recipe just enough to make the dough a bit more workable and then rolled them and cut them into strips about an inch wide. Be careful here too much flour will ruin the noodles. The review where the person forgot to bring the broth to a boil prior adding the giant lump of noodles is good information for the novice cook however I don't feel the rating is fair insofar as the recipe is concerned because the result was doomed from the start. Doing this type of thing takes loving time and patience. If you don't have the time then save it for another day. Afterall good homemade chicken soup is great year round.",
