It makes yellow cake more buttery tasting... its great with lemon or carrot cake..and its also great with freshly-baked mini croissants too- slice them open spread some chantilly inside sprinkle some macadamia nuts in it and drizzle the outside with melted chocolate... impress your houseguests with that elegant and delicious dessert...",
