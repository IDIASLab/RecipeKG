I would have to say this is some of the most delicious food I've ever enjoyed. The flavors of jalapegno garlic tomatoes and the spices blended so perfectly. My husband used several expletives and the word 'abrosia' to describe his pleasure. This is on our 'must share with friends' short list. Thank you so much for sharing!!!! P.S. Individuals with sensitive palates should note that I added two huge jalepegnos and used the seeds from only one of them. This produced a very high level of heat for us and we are accustomed to eating hot food.",

It's very simple to prepare there is the chopping of the onions and the mincing of the Ginger garlic and cilantro but I let my mini food processor do that! I used a large can of WHOLE tomatoes including the juice instead of fresh.I did cut them in large chunks. ( I don't like canned diced tomatoes as they tend to disintergrate to quickly). I used double the cilantro. The color was bland so I added some turmeric that a prior reviewer suggested. I didn't use naan. I actually served this in mini whole grain bread boules. I made a tray of condiments and things for my guests to add on their own.... Jalapenos yogurt fresh peas baby shrimp cubed chicken more cilantro chick peas quinoa. My family and guests really liked being to add what they wanted and adjusting the amount of cilantro and jalapenos. I served lime and mango sherbert for desert... Light and refreshing ending! I'll make this again and again. I froze leftovers in individual containers... I always make a double batch. Freezes great for a great lunch side dish dip or dinner again. You'll love it.",
