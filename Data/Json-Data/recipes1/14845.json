HOWEVER if anyone thinks that a 3.5 pound chicken is going to feed 6 people especially 3 men you've got another thing to think about! After considering this factor I used a 7 pound capon and roasted it instead of cooking it on top of the stove. I basted every 25 minutes which kept it moist. I served it with varigated wild rice and the end results was rave reviews by all!",

After putting half the bird in a \"to go box\" for her, I had the other half for my family. We found the meat to be moist and subtly flavorful, suffused with the wine and the lime, and the sauce was fabulous and brought the Spanish rice I had paired with the chicken to life. \nFor many Americans, used to frying, roasting, or barbecuing their chicken, the idea of braising it in wine and not crisping the skin might seem a bit unusual. However, it left the chicken tender and full of flavor. I used a 4.5 pound chicken, and it cooked to 180 degrees in one hour. I ended up discarding most of the skin, but the flavor of the fat mixed with the wine, brandy, and shallots to make the sauce incredibly good.\nWe will definitely make this recipe again.",
