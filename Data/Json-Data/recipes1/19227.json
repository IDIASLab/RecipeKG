I made this tonight for my boys and I and this was the first night in the longest that all three of them were quiet and ate their dinner without complaint. I had some leftover Boilermaker Tailgate Chili that I used in this and I had some XXL hot dogs and Sara Lee bread I had bought on the cheap at my local discount grocery store. Quick and easy supper and most easy on the wallet. My family was so happy. Thanks so much. NOTE: I used a pizza cutter to cut the bread and hot dogs into smaller pieces for my boys before I added chili. I also boiled my hot dogs.",
