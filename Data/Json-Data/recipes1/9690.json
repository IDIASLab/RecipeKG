Very easy to bake. Next reduce the cream to a half pint or so. You sure don't need a quart! I found the snails somewhat bland so when I'm draining them before sauteing them I liberally sprinkly them with cracked black pepper kosher salt and dill weed which gives them a very unique taste. I add all of the cream sauce to the pan and bring it to a boil. I pile about 6 snails in and around the smaller baked puff pastry shell and pour sauce over the top.",
