I suspect that anyone who had a problem with the frosting tasting like shortening probably had shortening that was going bad from age. I learned from experience that if shortening is old, the flavor overpowers anything it's cooked in. Yuck! Anyway, this is definitely my new favorite icing recipe!",

You can even add a drop or 2 of orange food coloring! It turned out great!!!",

I sometimes get cravings for birthday cakes just for the icing. Now I can make my own at home. I used regular vanilla instead of the clear and it came out bright white!! I didn't have to beat mine anywhere near five minutes more like 2. I did add 2 more TBLS. of water so that may have been why. Thanks Meghan...this is so good!",
