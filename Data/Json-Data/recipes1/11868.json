I also added 5 T milk, 1 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper to the eggs. I used 2 c sharp cheddar in the egg mix, and topped it with another c of shredded cheddar/monterey jack blend. I used pam non stick cooking spray to coat the pan, but think a light coat of crisco shortening would have been better as some of it stuck a little. I baked it for 25-30 minutes instead of the 15 indicated. Will feed 9. My gang loved it!",

You need to brown your sausage or bacon and that takes more than 10 min. to prep it all so just be prepareed to allow some time. I like to make it at night (prep) and put in fridge overnight so it all soaks in the bread. then take out and back in the morning. I covered with foil for 20 min. then uncovered for 20 min. and that seems to bake perfectly. I used bacon instead and only 12oz. it was very flavorful with that much bacon. also about 1/2 less cheese. Will make again this way.",
