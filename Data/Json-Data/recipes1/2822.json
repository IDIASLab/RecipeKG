I wasn't too sure at first because over time the liquid and apples separated but I made apple pies with it and it was just great.  Sure cut down the time in making apple pie from scratch and at the same time was far superior to canned apple pie filling.  The ony change I will make this year is to change the spices to agree with my personal taste as I found this to be a little lacking in flavour.",
