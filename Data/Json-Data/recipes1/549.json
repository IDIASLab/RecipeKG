                "reviewBody": "I give this recipe 5 stars because it has GREAT flavor. HOWEVER - I MADE A CHANGE which also resulted in a wonderful 'full' cookie. Something to keep in mind when baking cookies is that if you use butter your cookie will spread much more than using shortening. After reading several reviews which commented on the cookie recipe spreading a lot I decided to replace the 3/4 c butter with 1/4 c butter and 1/2 c butter flavor shortening. This change will give your cookie a flakiness or 'shortbread' texture yet keep it's shape as it cooks without spreading. I also decided to alter the flour - I used 1/2 regular flour and 1/2 self rising flour. This too helped keep the shape. I also put my dough in the freezer for 2 hours to chill (I was working on rolling out a batch of regular sugar cookies) so that when I placed it on my well floured board it rolled out perfectly. I always hate to see good reviews for a recipe that has been changed as it really isn't the same recipe if it has been changed up... but this was a great base to work with and with the slight alterations which didn't affect the flavor whatsoever it will be a cookie recipe that I will use for years to come. Thanks!",

I made one full batch and they were indeed flat. That would have been okay - some flat cookie recipes are meant to be just that and taste great. These on the otherhand felt very greasy and tasted that way. My husband really wanted maple cookies and I was tempted to switch recipes but decided to try this one again with some changes. Reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and increased the flour by 1/4 cup. They didn't come out nearly as flat had terrific flavor and were softer a little more cake-like. I made the icing as directed and drizzled it over the cookies. My husband loves these and agrees with the submitter's husband - these remind him of a maple bar - his favorite kind on doughnut. Will probably make this again but definitely with changes.",
