For starts, I couldn't help but wonder if the lack of success of others was due to the lack of baking powder.  It did call for \"self rising\" flour, but if you missed that part, your scones could fall flat.  I did at first, but ended up adding 5tsp of baking powder to the mix.  I also sprinkled a cinnamon/sugar mix on the top and baked for about 35 minutes.. they came out nice and fluffy, more breadlike than scone like, actually, but tasty.  They aren't too sweet, but scones typically aren't anyway... a little pumpkn butter and/or devonshire cream would do these up nicely :).  I give it 4 stars with adjustments :)",

I was a little worried about the recipe after reading the reviews but I had no problems with it. I did have to sub the self-rising flour since I never buy the stuff. I mixed 3 1/2 c All purpose flour 2T Baking powder and 2t salt then went ahead with the recipe. They rose very well for me. Also just used a 15oz can of pumpkin. Instead of cutting into rounds because I'm lazy I placed the dough on a sheet of parchment paper pressed it out into a rectangle and then used an oiled pizza cutter to cut it into squares and then baked it. Sprinkled the tops with a little sugar before baking. They came out perfect. I personally wanted a little more spice to them but when I mentioned that to hubby he glared at me. Served this with Cinnamon Honey Butter (AR). Will make these again. Thanks for the recipe!",
