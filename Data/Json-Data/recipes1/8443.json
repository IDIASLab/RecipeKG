I just throw whatever type of bread I have in the house (even bagels in desperation) into the food processor. It really makes a difference. I also used a ton more garlic then called for only because we're totally addicted. If you don't have the onions in the house it still tastes awesome. I personally don't mind having extra bread crumbs because I usually sprinkle them around the chicken and when dinner is done and eaten I like to nibble on the buttery toasty crumbs left in the pan. I know I know...very bad but sooooo good!! Hey the cook has to have fun once in a while!",

I did spray the bottom and sides of the crockpot with Pam before starting. This is a very easy dish to make and a great combination of flavors! This one is going to be a new family/company favorite! I made sweet potato pie and a fresh garden salad with it...YUMMY!",
