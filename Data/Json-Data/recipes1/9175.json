Use E.V.O.O. instead of butter....it is so much better and I use a terra cotta flowerpot and base to make this in. Soak the pot in COLD water for 20 minutes and place the garlic (and pot) in the oven then turn on the oven....let the garlic bake while the oven is preheating. Then I let it bake for 30 minutes after it reached 350 degrees. This is the way I was taught to do this...and it works every time. Delicious with crackers or a dense bread. Thanks for the post.",

I made one for each of us and we still fought over who was getting more.; ) I cut off about a quarter of an inch off the bottom of the bulbs (the pointy end) before cooking. It was a lot easier to squeeze the garlic out the end. I think the cooking time needs to be extended to 35-40 minutes. My garlic was still a little tough. I also would dribble garlic over the top of the bulb as well as in the bottom of the aluminum foil packet. But overall very easy and delicious. (fyi one nice italian restaurant we go to serves a bulb of baked garlic 3 pats of cream cheese and 5 pieces of crispy herb brushetta for 6.95. Now I can make this at home for cheap)",

Really I think that this particular recipe deserves a three due to the fact that olive oil is what you should use instead of butter and the time seems off. But baked garlic is so good that I upped it to four. I use olive oil and a bit of salt and snip the ends off so that the garlic comes out easy. I also invested in a small clay pot specifically designed to roast garlic it is wonderful! I also roast garlic much longer than 30 minutes maybe it is just my preference.",

I upped the heat to 400 and baked for 45 min. Mushy but so easy then to serve/eat. I should have salted them too but I skipped it. Served with a ramekin of parmesan one of olive oil with rosemary infused and one with a ajvar (roasted red pepper and eggplant with a kick) and crusted sourdough. What I liked about this approach is that each of my guests took a bulb onto their own plates and we finally got to use those cute little appetizer knives and forks we got for our wedding.:-) Make this one a staple -- cheap easy healthy and always a winner with the guests.",

It appears to me that the recipe must have used salted butter. Salt brings out the sweetness and cancels bitterness. If you fail to use salt or 1/2 salt you don't get the sweetness she is talking about. Experimentation yields the following: Terra cotta baking dish is great. It is cheap. Cut off tops as was suggested by one reviewer. This is absolutely required. Salt a must. 1/4 teaspoon Olive oil. small pat of oleo on each bulb bake at 350 for 20min without top. drizzel or baste olive oil on bulbs to keep away dryness continue baking closed top for 10-20 minutes or until outer cover is light brown. Baste with oil mix from bowl during that time. Squeeze out into its own dish and arrange for presentation. black Pepper can be added before initial baking if desired.",
