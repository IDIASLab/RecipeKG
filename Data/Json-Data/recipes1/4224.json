The consistency and flavor have the appearance of a four or five star restaurant!  I used fresh basil out of our herb garden and fresh Roma tomatoes.  I didn't bother to peel the tomatoes.  Why?  The recipe could not have been any better.  Yes, it is fattening.  Yes, it could be made healthy.  But NO!  Don't do it! If anybody ever ask for homemade tomato soup of any kind, let this be the definitive one; it would be hard to do better.",

I would recommend only blending 1/3 to 1/2 of the soup, leaving some chuncks gives it a nice consistancy.  Also pealing and seeding is not a necessity.  I did it the first time and not the second time and could not tell the differece. Also if your in hurry canned tomatoes work well as a substitute. Dont skimp on the basil, thats what makes it wonderful. Overall A++ a really great soup for any occasion.",

Since I am always on the lookout to make recipes healthier, next time I will decrease the butter to 1/4 cup & use half & half instead of cream & see if it alters the taste any. I did increase the basil some (practically butchered my little basil starter plants but it was worth it) & I garnished the soup w/ a slice of fresh mozzarella cheese & a sprig of basil. I served this al fresco on my patio w/ a salad & a glass of white merlot...just like dining at LaMadeline's!",

The result at that point was a wonderfully fresh and vibrant soup.\n\nI should've stopped there.\n\nI added the butter, and slowly added the cream, stopping to taste after about 1/3 of a cup.  The vibrancy of the basil was totally gone, and the zip of the tomatoes was much diminished.  I stopped adding cream and added salt, pepper, and lemon juice to try to jazz up what I'd ruined.\n\nI'd suggest omitting the cream, cutting the butter in half, and increasing the basil by a third.  If you insist on all the cream and butter, I'd about triple the basil.",

I blanched the tomatoes for about 30 seconds to remove the peel, but didn't bother with seeding them.  And my trusty little immersion blender made quick work of pureeing this soup. Because this calls for fresh tomatoes, only the reddest and ripest should be used for best flavor. If those aren't available, it would be better to substitute canned. I made half the recipe, which was just right for the two of us (considering that hubby liked this so much he had himself a second bowl full!) ",
