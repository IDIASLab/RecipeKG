Zucchini and yellow squash already contain a lot of water, so to add any is really unnecessary. So I eliminated the water altogether, added a clove of minced garlic and some sliced mushrooms, and cooked this just until done but still retaining its shape. It turned out beautifully and the bacon was a flavorful addition. Five stars just by skipping the water!",
