It is fast and easy. The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I added \u00be of a teaspoon of hot sauce.  I think that is really based on taste. The first time I made it was for a birthday party I was doing for my sister at church.  I cut out a few steps.  I bought Wal-Mart fully cooked meatballs and let them thaw the night before in the refrigerator. Sunday morning I made the sauce. It took about 10 minutes.  I put the meatballs in the crock pot and poured the sauce over it and put set it on low for an hour.  It was ready when I was ready to leave for church. I set the crock-pot on warm during church.  This was a big hit.  Not one meatball was left.  I served it with Hawaiian King rolls and salad. It made a full meal.",
