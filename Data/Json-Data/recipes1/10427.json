Instead of cayenne pepper I used black pepper. They don't call it garbage quiche for nothing you can add what you like! I'm going to make another pie with the same basic ingredient except I'll add spinach and seafood!",

We had it for dinner tonight and have a whole other quiche that I will take to work for lunch for the week. Lucky me! Even our extremely picky three-year-old ate it without (much) complaint.

Because I was out of fat free half-n-half, I used fat free evaporated milk. I did throw in one small chopped organic red pepper, a little dijon mustard, onion/garlic powder, and a little Frank's Hot Sauce. We all liked this, though for a half recipe, I'd like to double the cheese next time. This was a great way to use up odds and ends in the fridge and leftover Christmas ham. We ate this with leftover Unbelieveable Rolls, which are also from this site. NOTE: I did scrape out most of the innards from my roma tomatoes so they wouldn't water down or gooey up the quiche. I just cut it in half length-wise, then carefully used a spoon to scrape out the seeds.",
