I'm glad I made this cake for my whiskey loving guy...I made a couple of changes: I didnt grind the almonds quite as finely as I was supposed to I left out the raisins I added a small scoop of semi sweet choc chips in addition to the german chocolate. I made whip cream from this site and added whiskey to it =) yum..it added a nice light touch to the dense chocolate cake AND I made chocolate ganache from this site (added whiskey to that too) instead of the topping the recipe suggested...Dont be afraid of the whiskey taste being too overpowering..chocolate and whskey are the BEST combination!!!

I then proceeded to forget it @ work wednesday night so on thursday night I took it to Deb's house for dinner. I made ganache since I hadn't iced it w/the icing suggested in the recipe. Made the icing - it seemed wrong so I didn't use it. Anyhow I made the ganache (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chocolate-Ganache/Detail.aspx?prop31=4) but omitted the dark rum thinking it would save this old dried out cake. Well this cake didn't need saving! It was fantastic! And the ganache was an excellent addition. Next time I will either mash up or puree the raisons or leave them out all together. We all agreed they were weird in the cake.",
