                "reviewBody": "If you read up on sourdoughs and starters, you'll find that one of the reasons people mess with them is the health benefit of the natural occuring yeasts.  Unfortunately, most people these days have become too \"domesticated\", and so can't see how letting something go sour on its own can be any good.  Thus, most \"official\" starter recipes call for addition of store bought yeast.  In the authentic way, you start with one cup each of flour, milk and sugar, stir it every day for the first 4 days, add one cup each of flour, milk and sugar on day 5, stir well; stir it every day for the next 4 days; add one cup each of flour, milk and sugar on day 10, stir well - and you should be ready to use the starter.  Traditional recipes ask to only use wooden or plastic bowls/jars/utensils.  This is done because there is a possibility of the yeast's acidity acting on the metal and changing PH and messing everything up.  The other important point to make, is that when you're making the starter, it should be left uncovered or covered loosely with cheese cloth or such.  The starter needs airflow!  Once ready, the starter could be kept in the fridge for about 2 weeks; to reactivate it, take it out and feed it with one cup each of flour, milk and sugar, stir well and leave at room temperature.  I think that starter can be covered with a lid/kept in a zip-lock bag while refridgerated.  For those who want to have their starter always available - keep it at room temperature, stir it every day, and fe",

The Starter is on Day 6 and is growing and bubbly like I have NEVER had it before...must be the little bit of air.  My instructions say DO NOT USE METAL to stir...I use the handle part (with a hole in it) from a plastic ladle...you can use anything when you're baking on day 10.  I also keep 1 cup for my next starter batch and cook a DOUBLE recipe of the same cakes using about 2 cups of starter for each recipe.  Works out great! This is a great beginner/experimenting/use what you have on the shelf kinda recipe.  Wrap extra cakes (LOL if there's any left) in waxed paper, then in foil, then place in plastic bags in the freezer...they last for months!
