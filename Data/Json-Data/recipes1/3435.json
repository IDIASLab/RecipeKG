I am sure the use of the applesauce instead of oil makes the cake slightly lower in fat.  I anticipated the frosting being overly soft...but it wasn't.  I used it to frost the entire cake....and it held up fine.  I used the jellied cranberry sauce for the frosting not the kind with the whole berries....maybe this made the difference.",

I also felt the \"frosting\" was not very thick even though I did use the whole cranberry sauce but I carefully spooned it on the first layer so it partially ran down the sides and did the same on top. I did not use it all so put the rest in a container and people could use more if they liked. I'm wondering since it calls for 1/4 c. sugar maybe use 1/4 c. powdered sugar if that would firm it up a little. Might try that the next time. A very pretty cake for the holiays.",
