I also added a dash of allspice. Did this in the microwave for 12 minutes on high. It turned out great! It was the perfect breakfast treat when I was out of eggs and out of ideas. It was a little dry but I'm wondering if that's because I took out the raisins and it wasn't anything that hot chocolate or coffee/tea couldn't fix. I will definently be making this one again! My 1 year old and 2 year old both loved this and it is cut back on fat for me.",

As an adult and like everybody else you watch fat intake. My grandmother made this with lard. So I decided to make with Crisco.. changed the whole complexion of the cake taste and texture. Her recipe was larger also. She used cloves cinnamon ginger and COCOA when boiling with the raisin. When it cooled she added as she said \"2 glasses of cherries\". To this day I still think did she drain or not.. she did chop them. we had to reconstruct her recipe after she passed. I make this every year at xmas and give as gifts. People like better than fruit cake as it is more moist.",
