                "reviewBody": "These are so good! My son said \"best cookies EVER\"!! The dough itself is really nice and complements the candy bar pieces very well. I refrigerated the dough between batches since it was fairly soft and greasy with all the pb and butter and it helped when shaping it around the mini size bars (very important to use mini NOT fun size). I used a bag of mixed snickers (regular dark chocolate and almond) which was fun so they'd all be a little different. Also make sure to bake only 13 minutes the first batch and check 13 minutes was PERFECT for my oven lightly browned and they firmed up while they cooled on the cookie sheet - I did my first batch at 15 minutes and they were crunchy when they cooled and browner than I wanted. The interesting thing I noted between the 2 batches is that 15 minutes the candy bars melt completely into the cookie at 13 minutes some of the candy bars still held their shape so the cookies were more lumpy and have more solid candy bar pieces in them when cooled. Neither way is necessarily better I just thought that was interesting to note. These are super yummy and fun to make and eat will definitely use again!!",
