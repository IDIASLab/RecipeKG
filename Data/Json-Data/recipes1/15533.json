Even though there were no cracks (used all the tricks - waterbath, greasing sides of springform pan, cooling slowly) I ended up topping with a strawberry glaze.  I actually think next time I'll use a 10\" pan - this cheesecake looked very impressive, as it was tall, but it was so rich that a normal sized slice was almost too much to handle.  Otherwise, perfect flavor, texture and will definitely be repeated in our house.",

I made it into cheesecake cupcakes by putting a cookie into the bottom of each paper liner for the \"crust\" and then piling the filling on top. I baked them for 20 minutes in a water bath (it's worth it to read the \"tips for cheesecake\" on this site). They came out beautifully.",
