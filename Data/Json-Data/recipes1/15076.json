I hadn't had this in probably 50 years! It was ok but the cinnamon and vanilla kind of got in the way for me perhaps only because my memories bias me. Whole milk as I enjoyed this in my childhood makes this particularly rich creamy and satisfying. In addition just warming it was more appealing easier to drink (and safer for children!) than heating it to piping hot. This is a wonderful comforting drink especially for children and especially if your grandma brings it to you in bed.",
