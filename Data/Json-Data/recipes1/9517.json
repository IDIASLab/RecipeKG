I made this for my family's Thanksgiving dinner this year, and even people that usually won't touch cranberry sauce couldn't get enough.  I highly recommend using the whole berry sauce in place of the jellied... the berries add a certain something special to the contrast.  Also, rather than simply sprinkling the pecans on top of the salad, I mixed them in well with the rest of ingredients to get a little in each bite.. delicious!  Be sure to get as much of the juice out of the pineapple as possible, you won't be disappointed with the result!",
