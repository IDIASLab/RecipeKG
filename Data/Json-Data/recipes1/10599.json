Full of flavor, and makes a great base sauce for lasagna.  It's critical to use fresh basil, other herbs may be dried.  Do not use canned tomatoes which have any corn syrup in them.  Home canned tomato equivalent is 3 quarts.   If you want a spicier sauce add either crushed red pepper to taste or use hot Italian sausage.",

I can see how this would make a wonderful lasagna sauce! My husband & daughter opted to eat it over spaghetti and I ate it out of a bowl with garlic bread. We loved it loved the vegetable content loved the fresh flavor loved everything! Just don't expect a super thick sauce it has no tomato paste or thickening agent--but it is wonderful without it and you don't feel heavy after eating it. I'll definitely make it again!",

Considering using half as much meat next time; this sauce is rich and thick.  I'm freezing, so have not yet added the herbs; already super delicious.  Followed the recipe except:  hot Italian sausage instead of sweet; half the mushrooms, chopped; no olive oil (which would reduce the fat level cited in the nutrition info); one intitution-sized can of crushed tomatoes (102 oz) in place of 3 - 28 oz cans diced (84 oz).  Slight changes in methods; saves a dirty pan and flavors veggies.  Plus, recipe doesn't say WHAT to do with the reserved 'drippings'. Crumble meat in large pot and start browning; chop and add onion; shred and add carrot.  (Carrots need to cook longer than peppers and zucchini.)  Dump into colander to drain fat, if needed.  Put entire mixture back into pot.  Add peppers, zucchini, and mushroooms.  Saute until just tender.  Add tomatoes, then spinach, and then simmer.  I ended up with this huge can of tomatoes because it was all I could find without added corn syrup.  I don't plan to add sugar to the sauce, either, altho at times a tiny bit of sugar may be needed in tomato sauces.  Not in this one, with all the veggies.  Doesn't taste a bit acidic.  Anyway, LOVE this sauce.  Try it, you'll like it!",

The recipe doesn't state this but I added the meat into the sauce then covered to simmer.
