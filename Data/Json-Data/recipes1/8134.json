I used grenadine syrup instead of cherry juice and a cinnamon candy for the top since I was out of maraschino cherries. I didn't care much for the mayo taste though so I'd skip it next time but that's a personal thing I really don't like mayo anyway. I used fresh pears instead of canned. This is a really pretty dish as well. Thanks.",
