I was waiting for my sweet potatoes to finish baking, and left the heat on the skillet, so my apples ended up a bit mushy.  But that\u2019s my fault, not the recipe\u2019s.  I liked this well enough that I\u2019m going mix up a bottle of the spices to have on hand for an even speedier dinner.  And did I mention how easy this is to make??  Well, it is.  Simple Saturday evening dinner paired with baked sweet potatoes, green beans, and cranberry sauce.  Thanks for sharing, we really enjoyed this.",
