It came out very yummy and the whole family -- including kids who don't like beans in anything but chili -- asked me to make it again. I had only sausage links so I sliced those and used them. Great Northern Beans are very dfficult to find here so I used canned beans with tomato sauce. There was no spinach pasta to be found and so I added corn kernels. Unlike pasta the corn stayed firm for leftovers the next day. Great modifiable recipe. Thank you.",
