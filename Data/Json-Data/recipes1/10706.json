Mix this together salt and pepper it spread in casserole dish. Top with cheese and potato chips as desired. The mayo is just enough to moisten and hold it together; it shouldn't be like a sauce.

Instead of using mayonaise I like to use a creamy dressing like blue cheese or ranch to give the chicken more taste and I omit the lemon juice. I like to also layer cooked potatoes on the bottom of the baking dish to absorb the juices. I make sure to use tasty flavored potato chips for a topping. You also have to make sure the potato chips are on top of the cheese or it doesn't turn out as good.",

I would probably reduce the mayo further (maybe 3 cups and add more as needed if the mix seems dry?) maybe only use half that amount of lemon and almonds... I think that would make this perfect. Otherwise it's not a bad recipe the way I made it. Also FYI I swapped the chicken breasts for two pre-made rotisserie chickens from my local grocery store... just pull the meat off the bones and add to the mix. Convenient and delicious!",
