I chopped two granny smith apples used to 1/2 pints of red raspberries. Did not have any brown sugar on hand so used 1/4 cup dark maple syrup two tablespoons of strawberry jam and 1 tablespoon of grenadine (just to see what would happen). I added all of this to the fruit and made sure everything was coated and poured into pie crust. Made the crumble and baked. This was really good but was very tart -- I was afraid of the pie being too sweet because of the maple syrup and the grenadine but the granny smith's really kept things from being sweet. Next time will use 1/2 cup maple syrup.",
