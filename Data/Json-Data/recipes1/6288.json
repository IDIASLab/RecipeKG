It's also good with a small sprinkling of sesame seeds too. My mom makes it this way and she's Japanese. It's fantastic!I checked with her today and she doesn't add sugar or rice wine vinegar. I always thought she had....at least added the vinegar I mean. I plan on making cucumber salad today as my side to teriyaki chicken and rice. I will try the vinegar because it sounds like a great balance to the other flavors. Enjoy it any way you make it. Cucumber salad is the best.",
