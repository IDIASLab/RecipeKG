I was only cooking for two so I ladled some of the juice/onion mixture into a saucepan and added enough penne for two and let it simmer until the pasta was done and shredded one of the breasts and added it to the pasta - was a yummy supper for two and I have enough leftovers to do that again, plus cooked chicken for other uses.",

In a pyrex baking dish I pour the mixture over 4 skinless / boneless chicken breasts and top the breasts with Sargento blended provolone - mozzarella mix cheese slices (I recommend the provolone slices if you can't find the blend) and bake for 45 minutes at 350 degrees. You can sprinkle freshly grated parmesan cheese over the breasts for the last 10 minutes of cooking. The breasts cook to a beautiful golden color and the parm adds a great finishing flavor. The breasts remain extremely moist and it will become a favorite with family and friends! I serve with rice and pour the remaining sauce mixture over the rice. Broccoli also goes well as a side veggie. YUM!!!",
