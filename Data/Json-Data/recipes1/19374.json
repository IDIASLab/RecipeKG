I also added about a teaspoon of peppermint extract and it turned out amazing. It's a little thick during pouring but it's sets up good. When you bite into the fudge you get a smooth bite of peppermint perfection. Definitely will continue to make this in the future.",

I could not taste the mint. I asked a friend to make the same recipe using my modifications but adding more mint - in any form - to taste. She said she could never get enough mint either. If there was a way to get the flavors to come out I would like to try it but the white cchocolate was used in too much quantity and since there are not a large variety of ingredients changing them for something else would alter the fudge beyond recognition. I would call this white chocolate fudge.",
