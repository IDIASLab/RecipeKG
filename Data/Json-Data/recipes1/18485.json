After reading some of the reviews that the juice makes it too thin. I let the pineapple sit in a strainer for about 5 minutes then mixed with the cream cheese. It wasn't even slightly runny. It was perfect! Next time i will maybe try to sprinkle a little brown sugar on top of the ham.",

I made sure I drained the pineapple well before mixing it into the cream cheese and being careful not to overstuffand I let them in the refrigerator for several hours rolled in plastic wrap.

I actually found the pineapple cream cheese however I spread that on the tortillas and placed the crushed pineapple on top of that rather than mixing the two in a spread. To combat the fear of soggy tortillas I drained the pineapple in a collander then spread it out on paper towels and gently blotted everything to soak up more juice. To really hold everything together I made them a day ahead and refridgerated overnight. They were still bland though but not bad. Thanks.",

I just purchased plain cream cheese & whipped it up with my KitchenAid. I strained my can of crushed pineapple really really well & then actually threw it all in the KitcheAid with the cream cheese & blended it all together. Then I rolled them up tightly in saran wrap and threw them in the fridge & didn't cut them up until right before the party. Very cheap super easy & went over well at the bday party I took them to. Next time I might add in a bit more ham but that is all a personal preferance. Thanks for sharing!:)",
