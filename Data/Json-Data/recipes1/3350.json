Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage, 1 lb. ground beef, 1 boiled yellow bell pepper choppped(left over from stuffed pepper recipe), 1/2 vidalia onion chopped, 2 cloves garlic minced, 1 can diced tomatoes w/lime and cilantro, 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp coriander, salt and pepper to taste.

Regarding the dough I put the ingredients in my breadmaker and let it do the kneading for me and I just had to add a touch of flour. Turned out great. I got really lucky on the oil temp with no thermometer and they fried up nicely.. flaky and a lot like a pastry dough really. The only drawback was how difficult to judge how much filling I could get in the dough (not very much) and trying to seal these suckers up without ripping the dough was a bear! I think next time I'll make more dough and roll them out a little bit larger and thicker just to make it easier.",
