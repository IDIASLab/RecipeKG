Although it's still good before it completely sets up, it takes SEVERAL hours to harden (Like over night).  It's good any way you eat it though. Be careful to not press the graham cracker crust into the springform pan or it will be hard as stone in the bottom of your pan. I made a second batch with a double layer crust, since I like thick crusts, and I barely pressed it in. Much better.",

It is a very impressive looking dessert. We shared the dessert with our waiter staff and hostess. The raves came from all. I heard \"Awesome\" \"the best I have ever eaten\" and the restaurant wants the recipe. I guess there isn't a better testimonial than that. Allow enough time for this to freeze. I did it over night and suggest that it be left in the freezer til you are serving it. It melts fast!! If you spray the pan \"lightly\" with pam there shouldn't be any trouble serving it. Young and Old agreed on this one. Thank you!",

                "reviewBody": "Absolutely scrumptious! This is great to keep on hand in the freezer for unexpected company.  I've made this three times now and I have better luck with the flour/oat mixture if I bake it at 350* and keep a close eye on it. Ten minutes seems to work great. It starts to burn @ 400* for 10 minutes in my oven. I have tried it with both pre-chopped pecans and whole pecans broken into smaller pieces and I like the whole broken pecans the best because they toast better and they lend to the crunchiness in the layers. Using whole crushed graham crackers works better than the store-bought graham cracker crumbs also. My 14.4 oz. box came with three cellophane packs of graham crackers and one pack was the perfect amount. Do not press the crumbs firmly in the pan or you will have a hard crust. A light pat is all you need. The bake time of 6 minutes as stated in the recipe is perfect for the crust. I used a whole jar (17 oz.) of Mrs. Richardson's Caramel Topping, which is my favorite, just remember to save some to drizzle over each cut piece. It will take several hours to firm up so I suggest freezing overnight. My husband loves this recipe and gives this a five star! I also took it to work and one of the guys wouldn\u2019t let me leave without sharing the recipe. Well loved by all!",

It was super easy to assemble. To make sure the caramel sauce doesn't stick to the sides pour it away from the sides of the pan. It will eventually spread all over. I didn't have any pecans around but it tasted great without that addition. I even didn't have any oats so I ended up using a package of instant oatmeal! This dessert is very versatile to suit your tastes! Maybe I'll try chocolate sauce next time!!",
