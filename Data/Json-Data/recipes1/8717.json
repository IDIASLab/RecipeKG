Amazing wafer thin crisp cookies and adding the lemon gives it a great aroma and flavor. One modification -- mine only took 5-7 minutes in the oven. I found it best to remove them 1-2 minutes after the edges just turn slightly brown even though it is still soft in the middle otherwise they can burn easily. They finished browning while cooling on the pan. Also I may try rolling in more sesame before placing on the pan next time to make them look a little prettier.",
