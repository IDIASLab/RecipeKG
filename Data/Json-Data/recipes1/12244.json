THEREFORE, I cubed and cooked the potatoes first (in some veg oil instead of butter), added the green peppers, onions (as well as some fresh mushrooms, cooked/cubed ham and chopped broccoli) once the potatoes were almost done.  Then, I added apprx 1/4c milk to the beaten eggs and poured overall, flipping to cook.  Sprinkled some sharp cheddar cheese overall. Predictable taste but good none-the-less. Thanks Maggie.",
