Before you dredge your shrimp into the flour make sure you dry them well with paper towels. I used pineapple marmalade for this and once coated with the coconut we let them sit for fifteen minutes before we started the frying process. We made thirty skewers with three shrimp on each and my company couldn't get them into their mouths fast enough. This was an appy and I'm sad to say there were no leftovers! Thank you so much!!",
