I made my own crust using 1-1/4 c. graham cracker crumbs, 2 T. sugar and 5 T. melted butter, which I baked at 350 degrees for seven minutes. I knew I'd like a bolder lemon flavor so I added 1-1/2 tsp. grated lemon zest to the filling. After pouring the filling into the crust, I  baked the pie an additional 15 minutes. I omitted the meringue as I preferred to top it with whipped cream. This was light, silky smooth and refreshing, and probably about the easiest pie to make!",

I recommend doubling the egg whites, although it isn't necessary to double the sugar.  I loved how easy the filling was compared to the lemon filling I usually make.  It took less time and dirtied fewer pans.  It also cooked beautifully and kept beautifully.  No separating at the edges, and no weeping or beading!  I made this first in a lemon version, then in a lime version.  The lime was good, but the lemon was better. If you want a little stronger flavor, simply grate a little zest into it.  But everyone who ate my pies thought the flavor was great just as it was. Hope this helps someone.:-)",

I make sure to beat the filling on high for 3-5 minutes and it comes out nice and thick. I haven't had any problems at all with the meringue turning out although I do double the meringue ingredients so I can have a higher topping on my pie- I think it's nicer looking. Each time I've made this it's folks devour it in seconds- not even a piece left over for the one who baked it! Your recipe has been added to the Christmas Pie Must list- that's a HUGE honor in our house! This pie is great and I thank you so very much for sharing it!!!!!!!!!!!",
