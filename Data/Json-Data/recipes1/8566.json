I was very happy with how they turned out. For people who like moist biscuits you might need to add slightly more shortening and milk because this recipe makes traditional-style baking powder biscuits which are by nature fairly airy and dry. I have also added 1 tablespoon of italian herbs (anything will do basil oregano thyme) and mixed it in with the flour before adding the shortening. It gave these biscuits a lovely herbed taste! Will make these simple and delicious biscuits again and again. (My husband raved about them.)",
