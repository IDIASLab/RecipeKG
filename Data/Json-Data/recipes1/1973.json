As a note to a comment above, although many people now make mincemeat without meat; traditionally it was made with meat. Mincemeat developed as a way of preserving meat without salting or smoking some 500 years ago in England, where mince pies are still considered an essential accompaniment to holiday dinners just like the traditional plum pudding. This pie is a remnant of a medieval tradition of spiced meat dishes, usually minced mutton, that have survived because of its association with Christmas. These pies have also been known as Christmas Pies. Mince pie as part of the Christmas table had long been an English custom. \n\nToday, we are accustomed to eating mince pie as a dessert, but actually \"minced\" pie and its follow-up \"mincemeat pie\" began as a main course dish with with more meat than fruit (a mixture of meat, dried fruits, and spices).  As fruits and spices became more plentiful in the 17th century, the spiciness of the pies increased accordingly.\n\n",

To learn all about this go to:\n\nhttp://whatscookingamerica.net/History/PieHistory/MincemeatPie.htm\n\nThat helped me understand it even more and although the non-meat version has always been a staple for me for the last 49 of my 50 years, I'm also going to keep serving this new (to me) version of the truly traditional dish, it's wonderful!\n\nA very Merry Christmas to all and to all a Wonderful New Year!",
