                "reviewBody": "Since I don't like peanut butter and my husband and kids don't like coconut I thought this recipe was a good option. As I started making a batch I realized that I didn't have any cocoa powder. I'm not a chocoholic so I simply made this batch without any cocoa. In addition to not using the cocoa powder I decreased the sugar to just 1 1/2 cups and added the salt and vanilla to the butter/milk/sugar mixture. I also omitted the nuts and added another cup of oats. I had read previous reviews that indicated their cookies were gooey and didn't set up hence substituting the additional oats for the nuts. I also let the liquid mixture boil for two minutes. DO NOT OVERBOIL THOUGH! Lastly because my kids love chocolate I sprinkled mini M&Ms on the tops of the cookies. Do NOT stir the M&Ms into the hot mixture they will melt. I did need to push the mini M&Ms into the cookies a little bit so that they wouldn't fall to the base of the cookies. All in all I think my version is tasty and colorful. You can use certain color M&Ms for holidays and use school colors for bake sales and sporting events. One last hint. My kids went wild when they saw the finished product but I needed the cookies to cool off. When they weren't looking I simply placed my wax paper lined cookie sheet (with the cooling cookies) into our (cold) oven and set the timer for 30 minutes. I found this to be a great way to hide the temptation until the cookies were truly ready.",

My daughter wanted one so I let her have one even though they never set. I don't know if I did some thing wrong but I wouldn't probably make them again.

I will try this recipe again for sure and attempt to perhaps either use more oats by 1/2 a cup or so or maybe boil it a bit longer. (I boiled them for a little under a minute to try to insure right texture.) I didn't put the nuts in but I imagine that would help a little too. They taste FANTASTIC though!
