It was more like the casserole I was hoping it would be.  First, I used corn tortillas instead of flour (I read too many comments about flour tortillas turning to paste) I used cream of celery soup (a favorite)instead of chicken. I cooked the chicken using taco seasoning for chicken and added about 1c corn and 3/4c black beans once the chicken was fully cooked.  I also eliminated 1/2 of the sour cream and used a lite version.  It came out delicious and can't wait to experiment further.  Thanks for all the suggestions, they were very helpful!",

I think 8 oz. of sour cream and 2-3 cups of cheese would have made it a lot better and wouldn't have masked the taste of the beans and the salsa. This wasn't very spicy, so if you like that-you may want to add some diced tomatos and chilies. I probably will alter it like this when I make it again.",
