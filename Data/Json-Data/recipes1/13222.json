Instead of the 1 1/2 C of sugar (too sweet for my taste), I cut calories by using 1/3 C honey, and 2/3 C splenda gradular (or 18 packets of sugar substite). I didn't add in any raisins, coconuts, or walnuts (my boyfriend dislikes all of them), but added one chopped nectarine with the mango (I used 2 mangoes, a little over 3 cups). Instead of the cinnamon, I decided to try using ginger (1 teaspoon)--and it turned out great! Finally, I used 6 texas-sized muffin tins instead of the loaves--they were ready in 30 minutes. For about 300 calories per 6 oz muffin (with the changes), this was amazing...\r\n\r\nFor those whose bread did not rise: This uses baking soda exclusively, which requires an acid ingrediant to \"activiate\" it. Try using buttermilk or yogurt for some of the butter or oil, or add a teaspoon of lemon juice. I used sour cream--same idea. I had no problem with having this rise.\r\n\r\nOr, try using baking powder for some of the baking soda (I used 1 teaspoon baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda)",

Also, the second time I made it, I baked it at 325 degrees since it is so moist and needs time to cook from the inside out. Thanks for a workable recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "This has the bones of a fantastic recipe, but having actually tried it in its original form, I agree with the other reviewers about modifications being necessary for the bread to cook through properly and rise. Like some other reviewers, instead of just using the 2 tsp of baking soda called for, I used 3tsp baking soda, 1tsp baking powder, and 1tsp fresh lemon juice to get this bread to rise (otherwise it really doesn't!). Also, I baked at 325 degrees for about 50 minutes with both loaves in the oven at once -- cooked through perfectly.  Like others, I pureed the mango and because I used sweetened coconut, I cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups so the flavor of the mango has a little more chance to shine.  Excellent quick bread.",

After being in the fridge for a few days it was delicious. It needs a couple of days for the flavors to come together. One thing I noticed is that it didn't rise very much and the mangos settled to the bottom of the bread. What I'll do next time is chop the mangoes into smaller pieces and mix the mangoes with a little flour before I mix them into the batter. Regarding the rising I read in another review that this is the way it is. This is a great way to use mangoes.",

Although I did not put in raisins or nuts (not fam faves), and I did add a teaspoon each of coconut and rum extracts, I don't think the added 2 teaspoons of extract accounts for the mess.  I was originally concerned that with 3 cups of mango and only 2 cups of flour it might be a little gooey, but gooey doesn't come close to what this was like.  I cooked it for 1 hour 20 minutes when I finally had to take it out because I had to leave the house.  The taste is great, but it didn't turn out like bread of any kind.",
