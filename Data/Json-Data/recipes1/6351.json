I might try it with the red wine vinegar in place of the lemon juice as other reviewers have suggested and see how that is. The longer it sits, the better it gets. NOTE: A trick Grandma taught me to help draw some of the liquid out of tomatoes is cut them the way you want them on the salad, then lay them on paper towels and sprinkle with salt. Let them sit for a bit and drain. Blot with paper towels. You do this, your salad will be less drippy.",
