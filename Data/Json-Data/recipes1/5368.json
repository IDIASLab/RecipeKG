When it was done it was the exact color of Mt. Dew. I also frosted it with regular Decorator Frosting I (from this site) since my husband doesn't like pineapple or coconut. This made a different layer cake that was quite good and looked nice with some icing piped around the base and top.  I made the pineapple coconut frosting for the side and it tasted wonderful but would have been way too sweet on the cake.  Great fun recipe!  Thanks!",

I didn't have a lemon cake mix, so I used a yellow cake mix with pudding. I also added a tsp. of vanilla flavoring in with the cake mixture. When the cake was baked, I poked holes in the hot cake with the handle of my wooden spoon and poured the hot pineapple/coconut mixture over the cake, then cooled it in the fridge. When the cake was cooled, I frosted it with a container of whipped topping and sprinkled toasted coconut on top. (Almost like a Better than Sex cake.) Simple enough, but a really wet base cake. If I were to make this again, I wouldn't add a whole cup of vegetable oil. That seemed a bit excessive. I might cut it back to a half cup. Still, very good recipe for a cake. You can't tell that it's got Mountain Dew in it, but it's still very good. I think I might put a bit of lemon juice in the cake part next time, to make it more lemon-y.",
