I covered the crust with sesame seeds and a bit of coarse salt. I also added some chopped bell peppers which meant I needed to cut the water a bit. I would not advise anyone to mix their water first...active dry yeast does not need to be activated and good bread making technique is to add water a bit at a time until the dough is right. Don't let the water dictate the flour content. Even without the additions this would be nice tasty bread....thanks for the recipe.",
