I followed the recipe though I did use dough I'd already made and frozen. I was concerned w/the high bake time but it's spot on and will be my new pizza cooking method as the result is a perfectly crisp crust. I did not have fresh herbs so I chose to use a pinch of dried Italian Seasoning. Great stuff Chef John!",

So given that the recipe was for a 9\" pizza...doubled the ricotta mixture except for the oil. I also have no idea how to measure a cup of asparagus!! To me 'trimmed' means trim off the tough part of the stem not chop. So I probably used way more asparagus. (I had 36 spears most very small about 75% of a supermarket bunch.) I also used a pizza blend of cheese for the white cheddar and a bit of feta on top of that. Sounds like a lot of mods but I felt that Chef John was giving us permission so that's okay!! Next time I would like to add some onion and mushroom. Yummy!",

I cheated a bit used a thin crust in the tube pizza crust and always dust the pizza pan with cornmeal and a very thin coat of olive oil to prevent sticking. We like spicy so I used a teaspoon or so of the red pepper flakes along with Italian seasoning herbs. I did add mushrooms and onion with the ham. My asparagus were thin so no prep needed as Chef John said. Love the 5 min on low rack 5 min high. It was perfect-we are having it again tonight!",
