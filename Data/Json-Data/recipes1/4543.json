Let them bake 8-12 minutes, checking at 8,10&12 minutes - the bottoms should be golden brown. Pull the cookie sheets out and let the cookies rest on the sheets for a few minutes.  Do not keep in the oven because you think these are not done - cause they are!  They will harden up as they sit on the sheets and cool down. YUMMO!!!  I also have tried with sugar free cool-whip - less calores and it's still just so gooood.",

For as easy as this is to make the cookies taste better than I've had in a long time AND they always remain moist!",

(ie. red and green for Christmas) She would also make ahead and freeze. (freeze no longer than 2 months. let thaw in fridge for 24 hours) I'm so glad to see this recipe out here!

I found it too difficult to take the sticky thick dough and roll it in confectioners sugar so I dusted the cookie with 10X after baking. You don't get the crackle look but the taste is still there. You could call these cookies muffin tops and for those of you who are Seinfeld fans this is a good basis for a black and white cookie...just mix up two batches of icing one choco and one vanilla and brush half the cookie with each...Look to the Cookie!",
