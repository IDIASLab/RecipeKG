At the restaurant, if they would run out of the sauce, they would make it by hand by simply mixing equal parts ranch dressing and salsa, then adding a bit of chopped cilantro.  This is what I do and it is delicious.  I follow the recipe exactly otherwise and this is one of my family's favorite meals.  Also, if you want it to taste like the restaurant version, you MUST use liquid smoke.",

The first 2 or 3 times I made it I used regular Mayo and Sour Cream but now that we are watching what we eat I used light mayo and no fat sour cream and I cannot tell the difference what-so-ever! Because I BBQ the chicken I don't add the liquid smoke and I also substitute the tomato peppers and onions with a heaping tablespoon of salsa. Other than that I keep the recipe as is and we LOVE it! I would hate to be the restaurant near us that serves this dish because I haven't returned once to the restaurant to have this dish once I found this receipe!",

Before broiling in baking dish I added fresh chopped tomato and green onion on top of the cheese. For a side dish with it I saute'd 1 small yellow onion and 2 cloves of galic in (smart balance) butter and extra virgin olive oil added chopped sun-dried tomatoes and 3 HEAPING T. of the left over mexi-ranch dressing 1 pint of half and half and 1/2 c. fresh grated parmesan cheese. Let that simmer until thickened and added some leftover bow-tie pasta i had. s&p to taste. I served the chicken and pasta side by side with no corn chips. It was WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!! The chicken was juicy and tender. The pasta was a perfect compliment. Serve with a nice green salad. I will make this again for sure.",

Note about liquid smoke: there are two kinds. One is concentrated and you only need a few drops ever. The other is a diluted marinade version where you should use 1/2-1 tsp as directed. 2. I used 1/4 cup of tequilla and maybe a bit more lime than called for-will add more of both next time. I also left out the water but the chicken wasn't as moist as some reviews state. I may add some water next time. I was really happy with the flavors- you can distinguish them all after the chicken is grilled and it's a nice change for minimum effort (I cheated and mixed ranch and salsa).",

My only problem with it is that the liquid smoke taste is a little strong. The second time I made this I halved the liquid smoke and it turned out perfect. I served it to guests and they all loved it! And it's so easy!",
