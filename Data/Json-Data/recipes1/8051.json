                "reviewBody": "I took the advice that my fellow chefs offered and did the following: I mixed about 3/4 chunked red potatoes and 1/4 baby carrots; I used garlic oil instead of olive oil; I roasted them on heavy duty foil sprayed with Pam on a cookie sheet; I added fresh garlic, salt and pepper to the marinade; I marinated the veggies for a while first in the refrigerator; I sprinkled the top with seasoned salt and fresh ground pepper before I put it in the oven; I baked it at 350 for an hour tossing halfway through.  I didn't even realize that I had pulled out and opened a savory garlic and herb mixture instead of onion soup until I dumped it into the bag, but it was really good this way and worked really well with the meat I was serving.  My only complaint that it was a little wet still after an hour.  I might cut down on the oil next time, but I'm definitely making this all the time and experimenting with my flavors.  Yum!  Quick, easy and mess-free with foil.  We loved this.  NOTE: From now on when I make this I cook it for the first half hour at 350 degrees and then for 20 more minutes at 400 degrees.  It helps to make the potatoes nice and crispy, sweetens up the carrots and helps me get dinner on the table a little bit faster.  I've made this with the onion soup mix too.  My husband prefers that oniony taste, but we both love any version of this.  I make it all the time now.  SO EASY!!!!",

After reading most of the reviews, I followed some previous tips and did some of my own.  I used about 4 pounds of potatoes, and cut them into large wedges instead of just halving them.  Instead of the baking dish, I lined cookie sheets with foil and sprayed them with Pam.  (It is an easy clean up!) I did use the onion mix, and I used the 1/3 cup oil, b/c I had doubled the potatoes. (Other reviewers found that the oil used for the amount of potatoes called for turned out too greasy) I also added a little salt and pepper, rosemary, and a dash of italian seasoning.  I roasted them at 350 for a half hour and stirred them around every 15 minutes, then turned the oven up to 400 and roasted them another half hour, stirring every 15 min.  They turned out perfect - crispy on the outside, a little soft on the inside, not greasy at all.  My husband called them \"amazing\".  I am going to try them again tonight using a ranch dressing packet.",

They turned out good, they were definatly stuck to the bottom of the pan but clean up was a snap with the foil. My husband asked me to cut them into smaller pieces so they were crispier (I cut them into 12ths), even smaller they were still not overcooked. I did not save the leftovers - others said they didn't reheat well so no leftovers. They had plenty of flavor, they were able to wait till we were ready to eat and everyone liked them, I will make them again they were very easy - great for entertaining.",

Remember to adjust your cooking temp if you do this. I did 20 minutes at 450 and 20 at 350. I also lined a cookie sheet with foil, and laid a baking rack on top of that and laid the potatoes skin side down on that so that the excess oil could run off and be caught in the cookie sheet. I too thought the recipe called for too much oil. For added flavor I added garlic and fresh rosemary. I sprinkled salt, pepper and parsley flakes over them after they were laid out. I also let the potatoes marinate in the seasonings for a while before baking. The end result was very delicious and though I doctored the recipe, I still give the original 5 stars as thanks for the inspiration. We had a few left overs and I just heated them in a dry skillet the next morning for breakfast--very yummy!",
