I made this using all beef stock (1 cup) rather than using the brandy, and I used tenderized pork chops rather than chicken.  The flavors really mesh well together!  The tarragon is a nice complement to the artichokes...bravo!  I recommend this recipe to anyone wanting something different that is very easy to make.  I paired it with caramelized onions and red/orange bell peppers, and spinach almond brown rice, and the sauce went marvelously with the hole meal.  I will definitely make this again.",

Fantastic paired with just about anything. I'd recommend serving over grains rather than pastas however unless the pasta is couscous. I can't imagine omitting the brandy like many reviewers have it adds such a wonderful flavor to the dish. Use a good aged brandy and you wont regret it. I also don't understand the comments about this being \"bland\". I'm salivating just thinking about this recipe! I add minced garlic use marinated artichokes add a splash more brandy and give the sauce much more time to reduce and thicken. Turns out beautifully every time. I like the suggestion of adding kalamatas but I think with that addition I'd substitute sherry or red wine for the brandy. I just don't see kalamatas and brandy mixing very well. Kalamatas are soaked in red wine vinegar after all. I also like the suggestion of adding heavy cream to the sauce. It's an incredibly delicious dish as is but I think I'll try the cream for a little change and update afterward.",

Instead of flour I used seasoned cream of wheat (added poultry seasoning and lemon pepper along with the salt and pepper). Also I doubled the broth and cut out the brandy. I will pound out the chicken breasts even more next time and maybe add klamata olives with the artichokes. The coating turned out very crunchy and beautifully brown on the chicken. Love the brothy sauce this dish creates! I served it over couscous so that the wonderful sauce could soak in. YUM!",
