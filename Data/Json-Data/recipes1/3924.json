We really enjoy it hot from the oven but I seriously doubt we'll have any left over to try it toasted... We'll be making this often in our house. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with 3 cups flour (1 cup whole wheat flour, 2 cups bread flour) 1/3 cup fine ground cornmeal, 1 pkg quick rise yeast, 1 cup hot water, 1/4 cup blackstrap molasses (we love hardy molasses), 3 TB butter, 1 tsp salt and 1 egg. Use warm water (120-130 degrees F)since we used quick rise yeast (aka rapid rise). Baked at 350 for 30 minutes. We are in Anadama heaven! I also did not soak the cornmeal since I used finely ground cornmeal--but even so the crunch is pleasant. I also did not knead this dough--dough will be sticky, just place in 2qt well greased round casserole dish and cover with plastic wrap sprayed with cooking spray and let rise for about 1hr. Using the above measurements and changes this is a 5 star Anadama Bread recipe!!",

This one is more dense not as feathery light. It gets a hard crust which is good.

Given I know nothing about Anadama bread and thought I would try this recipe just because the Hubster and I both love molasses. Well it's going to go into our \"make it again\" list. It's got a gorgeous color dense crumb with a great soft texture & the crispiest delightful crust. I followed the recipe exactly except for shaping into a round loaf baked on a pizza stone instead of using a loaf pan. It was beautiful & delicious! We had warm slices of it fresh out of the oven for dinner with our soup then had it again toasted with cream cheese for breakfast. Love it! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!",
