I don't think some chopped parsley stirred in right before serving would be a bad idea either. I used a combination of chicken and beef stock (mostly chicken had both in the fridge) and felt this soup really needed a healthy dose of both salt and pepper. I'm used to potato soup with more of a milk/cream base so this was a little different. Not convinced that the \"puree\" consistency is my favorite so if I were to make again I'd move some of the potato quantity from what goes into the blender to the diced potatoes that are stirred in at the end. My personal preference would be to just mash some of the potatoes to get a thicker consistency not puree rather than pureeing the entire soup and adding just a handful of diced potato at the end.",
