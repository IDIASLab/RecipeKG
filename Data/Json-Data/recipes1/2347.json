So if you want to make them like we do in Denmark, and always have done, you need to put a piece of apple in every one of them. \nWhen they're done cooking on one side put a small piece of skinless apple in to the middle, turn them around with a knitting needle to finish cooking them on the other side. You can also use applesauce instead.\nTime to eat them, dip them in your favorite jam (we use jam from nordic berries like strawberry, my favorite), then dip them in icing sugar, eat and enjoy.\nWe're not only eating them at Christmas but at any occasion. More traditional Christmas cookies are ``Klejner (don't know what to call them in english)\u00b4\u00b4 and ``Pebern\u00f8dder (peppernuts)\u00b4\u00b4.\nI'll post recipes later.",

I have the typical sized aebleskiver pan and they turned out to be a bunch of little grease balls..they aren't supposed to have so much of a fried texture. Use a little bit of butter instead, and make sure the pan isn't too hot (medium to low heat). Since mine is a heavy cast iron pan it retains the heat really well and it if you have the heat too high it'll cook them unevenly and can be a bit messy. GREAT recipe other than that though, we loved it!",
