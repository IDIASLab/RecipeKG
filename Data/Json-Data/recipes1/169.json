Next time I think I'll try using Butter Flavored Crisco instead of regular. When mixing in the chips nuts and oats I recommend using your hands. The dough is very crumbly the last half of my dough I worked in 1 T of milk and it made the dough easier to work with and you definitely need to use your hands to form balls instead of dropping them by spoonfuls. The baking took the full 12 minutes.",

I don't like coconut so I used cornflakes and that was really good. I used the walnuts because Dad ate all the peanuts but next time I want to use peanuts. I also want to add some peanut butter for more flavor and beacuse the batter was a little crumbly and the cookie a little bit dry. I think it will add flavor and help hold the cookie together better.
