The yummy part is the filling and these were great! I made a batch with and without raisins and they both came out great. I used a 9x13 pan so the crust wasn't as thick as some said it would be. I also baked them for 35 minutes, then let them cool completely and put them into the fridge for an hour to set before cutting. Perfect!! These are far better than the tart shells - its a keeper!
