I added some jerky bits and they loved them I gave them to friends and had 100% approval even with people who said there dogs were picky. For my dogs on my 3rd double batch I rolled them out and cut them with a pizza cutter into strips then I can break them into little pieces for rewards or give them a big piece. I also just cut some in 1 1/2in squares and used my mini icecream scoop rolled some in balls with my meat tenderizer I made a pattern which made them look cute. Any dog would be thrilled to get these I even had friends cats eating them. I have made these so many times the easiest way I have found yet is to spray a 9x13 oan and press dough to the edge cut in 1x2 in squares and bake as directed and you have bar cookies my dogs like them chewy so this works out fast and easy.",
