I hosted a party Saturday where I served this crusty garlic bread with herbed dipping oil. Well I had a lot of bread left over as well as oil that had been sitting with the herbs in it. So I substituted the bread and olive oil in this recipe for the bread and olive oil that I had. I used a combination of sharp white chedder and colby jack cheeses. I also just used 2% milk. I didn't have cream so I just used what I had. I also used dried rosemary because I didn't have fresh rosemary. I added bacon pieces just to give it a little meat. Despite all my substitutions the dish came out really well. I will definitely be making this one again!",

I used some 1.5 week old garlic-seasoned bread leftover from a party and 2 cups of shredded Mexican blend cheeses. I omitted the onion since my guests aren't real fans of onions (I know what?) and added in a 10 oz. package of frozen spinach (first tried to add it into the pan with the oil and rosemary but I didn't thaw it ahead of time so I ended up removing the spinach block and heating it in the microwave then adding it to the bowl of bread cubes olive oil and rosemary). I also just used 2 cups of 1% milk since that's what I had and used all 6 eggs. I loved the consistency though I'm not familiar enough with either quiche or custard to say what it's more like. It was definitely a substantial meal component accompanied by Crispy Rosemary Chicken and Fries (without the fries) recipe here by Sandy Witek -- awesome. Next time I'll try to add in some mushrooms to see if this can be a complete meal in one dish!",
