I sauteed some chicken chunks in the olive oil with some chopped onion fresh sliced mushrooms and minced garlic in a skillet. I then added the Italian dressing and some grape tomatoes. I added basil and parsley with some Pecorino Romano cheese. I used Whole Wheat linguine because that is what I had on hand. After I tossed everything together I added some pine nuts all I can say is yummy!!! My family just loved it! Thanks for the recipe!",

I also sauted 1 cup of chopped RED onions in the \"salad dressing mix\" and also added a small can of sliced black olives. Excellent! Two thumbs up and 5 slices of bread!",
