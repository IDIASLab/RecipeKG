The medium chop I did was not delicate enough for these balls and chunks should not be present.\n\n2) The recipe could use a tablespoon or two more butter. They were too crumbly and became dry after a couple days.\n\nAlso, don't be fooled by the small amount of sugar called for. When you roll them in sugar, they take on much more sweetness. Stick with the 2 tablespoons.",

I put the chopped walnuts in the blender and pulse it a few times to get a finer texture.

The best part is that I can get all of them on one cookie sheet(They don't spread so you can place them close to one another)  I bake them for 12 minutes.  Beautiful!",

Goes well with coffee and tea.  Do NOT substitute butter for margarine.  The flavor of the butter and vanilla are essential to the recipe.  Overall, good.",

When creaming the butter and sugar I recommend using a food processor and adding the walnuts to it and pulverizing them into the butter sugar. Then add remaining ingredients using food processor to finish combining dough. Roll in SF sugar once before baking and once within 3 minutes of taking out of the oven. I found the amount of butter to be perfect. Bonus: if you don't have SF sugar but have a food processor just put regular granulated sugar in the processor for 2 minutes.:)",
