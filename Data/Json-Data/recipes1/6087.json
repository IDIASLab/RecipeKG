I did not use the full 1/4 cup of oil, but that is my personal preference.  then add salt & pepper if you like.  also, many reviews talked about there being too much dressing and the salad is just sitting in it.  once the tomatoes sit in the refrigerator, they release juices...this causes there to be more liquid in the bottom of the bowl, you will have some liquid even if you use a very small amount of dressing.  this recipe really is a 5 star for taste, however, due to the instructions i give it a 4.",

Marinated them overnight and then tossed the mix (didn't use all- about 3/4 of it) over the tomatoes 1/2 before serving. By doing this I did not have to put the tomatoes in the refrigerator -which i don't do, they lose flavor- and the salad doesn't get too runny. VERY nice!",

Next time I will use less than 1/4 cup oil and add more later if I need to. Otherwise, great recipe!",

It's especially pretty as a holiday dish because of the red and green colors and it's wonderful in the summer when we have fresh garden tomatoes. I've added the little yellow tomatoes and green peppers for extra color and the salad always tastes great. I even get requests for this salad when I'm invited to potlucks or parties. I too have found that the amount of oil can be reduced without any noticeable effect and I like to increase the amount of vinegar for extra tang. The toasted pine nuts impart a unique (delicious) flavor and are the crowning touch that sets this salad apart from the usual potluck fare.",

Used grape tomatoes because that is what they had at Sams Club. Also I had pimento stuffed green olives whole not sliced so I just sliced them and kept the pimentos in the mix.
