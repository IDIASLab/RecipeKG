After some experimentation I omitted the vanilla extract completely (too much vanilla with the pudding) and added about 1 tbsp of rum extract instead. The only other problem I found was that if I let it sit overnight in the fridge it got TOO thick - so I had to add some more milk and then some added Splenda to sweeten it up a bit more - not much though. I also added quite a bit of nutmeg but I LOVE nutmeg. Thanks so much Mark! This was so easy - and even my anti-aftificial sweetener friends loved it!",
