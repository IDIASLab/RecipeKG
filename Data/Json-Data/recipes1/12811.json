The changes I made was that I cooked the zucchini for a lot longer to make it quite soft. This did produce a lot of liquid so I used 1-2T of flour to thicken it into a sauce (mix flour into a paste with a little water before adding to prevent clumping). This really made a difference and the results were similar to an alfredo sauce with a lot less fat. My kids even loved it -- they ate it for leftovers the following day and begged me to make it for dinner that night as well. Definitely one of the best main dish uses of zucchini I've found so far.",

I put it in a colander over a bowl while water is boiling for pasta. Dump it in a linen towel and squeeze out the moisture. I also chop up a few cups of fresh spinach too. - I use 3 cloves of garlic and I don t brown it. I put it in the pan together with the first round of zucchini. Then add rest of zucchini & chopped spinach. I use veggie rotini pasta; it clings the ingredients better. Toss hot pasta with yogurt ( I use a small 5 oz or so cup of plain Greek) and shredded cheddar first. Blend well then add the zucchini mixture and toss. - Garnish with shredded Parmesan cheese It s really good this way too! Enjoy!",
