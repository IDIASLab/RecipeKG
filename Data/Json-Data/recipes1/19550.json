My chocolate just did not want to melt nicely so I finally just mixed the softened chips in with the rest. When I looked at this recipe I thought the kidlets would be the fans but the adults were far more enthused. I do have to say I probably would not have been rushing to make this without having the parchment to work on with what I expected to be melted chocolate. This is a fun recipe that I will make again and again.",

When you make this, use a HUGE bowl to mix the ingredients. Thin the chocolate with a little bit of milk so you get an even coating on the ingredients. This snack mix is a little on the sweet side. Give it a good sprinkle of Sea Salt to balance the flavors. Very good!",

However, I have to say, I thought it was better. It is much more fresh tasting. I also used real white chocolate, which I now realize they do not use more likely. I remembered at the grocery store I wanted to make the recipe, but didn't have it with me. I ended up buying the 4oz real white chocolate bar over the 12oz bag of white chocolate chip coating made from powdered milk and not real chocolate. So, I made a 1/2 recipe. I was still short 2 oz of white chocolate, but it was plenty. I used a bag of Orville Redenbacher gourmet natural lightly salted. It worked fine as the saltiness, made it overall not too sweet as opposed to plain popcorn. As I was short some of the white chocolate, I cut the cinnamon back to 1/2 tsp for 1/2 the recipe. I followed the rest of the recipe as is, just breaking up the regular sized pretzels. This was a fun recipe. I had more than half the ingredients already in the house. Just never would have thought to put them together this way. Interesting recipe. ty",
