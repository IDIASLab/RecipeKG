This does!  The part where you cover you Oreo \"meatball\" in chocolate.  \n\nA few hints: as you melt the chocolate, stir constantly and stop as soon as all of the stuff is melted - even a smidge before you think it's totally done.  Use a slotted spoon and drop the cookie in and pour the chocolate over it.  Move quickly or else the chocolate cools and it's like walking in quicksand.\n\nThe toothpick thing didn't work for me and was discouraging in the beginning - despite chilling the stuff it didn't stay together and \"muddied\" the chocolate. The spoon method was much, much better.",

You'll know it's well blended when the whole cookie mixture turns into a big blob...it won't be crumbly at all.  I also chilled the dough for about 15 min before rolling.  I then chilled the balls (in the freezer) for about 10 min while I melted the chocolate.  I dipped 1/2 the batch at at time & then melted the remaining 1/2 of chocolate for the 2nd tray of balls.

I made them for my hubby's company picnic and they were so well received that I had people actually asking if they could pay me to make them for their families for the holidays!  The recipe I have is the same as this except it calls for refrigerating the scooped balls for 1 hour before dippings, and also calls for dipping half of them in milk chocolate and half in white chocolate, then drizzling the opposite flavor over the top. (a slotted spoon works really well for both dipping and drizzling) An A+ recipe for sure!",

                "reviewBody": "These are great - and a hit at the party!  Really easy to make - I think the dipping worked well with using a teaspoon and fork - resting the truffle on the fork and using the spoon to pour the chocolate over.  I think the trick is to try and handle the truffle as little as possible and trying to keep them at the tip of the fork so that you can slide the fork out without having to touch the truffle when putting it back on the wax paper.  Chilling them for at least an hour helped (I think mine chilled for a little longer than an hour) and I kept them on wax paper on a metal cookie sheet to help keep them cool while I was dipping.  My next ones I'll try with a different cookie - probably nutter butters since after telling guests about this version, I got requests to make them next time with the peanut butter cookies!  I got many compliments so definitely making again :)\nThey are rich, so you can't have too many of these at one time - but maybe that's a good thing!",
