Just a couple of comments:  I left out the almond extract as my nephew has a nut allergy & everyone still thought they were delicious.  Also, I baked them on sheets lined with parchment paper instead of foil.  This eliminated the need to grease the foil, and preserved the gluten-free nature of the recipe (my sister has celiac disease, & Pam for Baking contains flour, so that wasn't an option.)  I was able to reuse the parchment sheets for each batch; the cookies slid right off the paper & cleanup was a cinch.",

I use Pam on the foil or more often parchment and haven't had a problem with sticking when I take them off immediately. It's a nice touch to place a piece of sliced almond on top after baking, or to dip the tops in a little melted dark chocolate.  I've served these at my daughter's weddings.  I recently changed my rating of these from a 4 to a 5 because I continue to make them after 4 years, and they are always a hit.",

Soooo easy to make, even with a toddler at my heels.\n\nI pretty much followed the recommendations of the other reviewers..I whipped the egg white till it formed soft peaks, used unsweetened coconut - I think it would have been too sweet otherwise. I added the almond extract to the condensed milk and mixed it together before adding the other ingredients (I only used 1 tsp). I formed little balls with the mixture, pressing them down slightly, then put them on greased tin foil.  After about 15 min. at 325 they started to get brown on the bottom, and I removed them  immediately from pan. \n\nThey came out perfectly and didn't spread at all.  I will definately be making a big batch of these for the holidays!  ",

The balls of macaroon kept their shape perfectly. Oh! And to prevent them from sticking to the pan I used silicon mats/silpat - did the trick didn't need any foil or non-stick coatings at all!",
