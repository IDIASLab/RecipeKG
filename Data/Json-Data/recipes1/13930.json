                "reviewBody": "I followed this recipe to a TEE and it was fantastic.  I used all the water recommended and all the sugar.  I found it not too watery and not too sweet.  I did find that it took about 50 minutes to get well-browned, and I even turned the heat up to 400 after 35 minutes. I used hard little tart apples - Im not sure what kind they were but I think the tartness was what kept this recipe from being overly sugary.  I think the right choice of apples may be key!  Its a wonderful recipe and I will definitely make it again.  EDITED:  Since my original review, I have made this recipe 4 additional times with different types of apples and they were all pretty darn fantastic.  I have decided that I like cooking it in a hotter oven (400) and it seems to get done in about the time stated.  Tonight I tried it without peeling the apples, and it was very good this way as well - if you dont mind apple skins.  For company, I might peel them, but my boyfriend and I enjoyed the version with peels very well - he even said he liked it better (though I disagree).",

Very simple, though cutting & peeling the apples take a long time. I used five large granny smith apples and a 9X13 glass pan so I had to increase all the ingredients by half and it worked out fine. I mixed brown & white sugar as others suggested and baked it 8 minutes longer and got a wonderful crispy topping! I will be making this again, for sure!!",
