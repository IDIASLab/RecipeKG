Just going strictly by this recipe - left me with a very bland soup with absolutely no flavor!!  I did alot of adding, just by taste, of course - no specific measurements.  I added a combination of the following: fresh basil, a little chicken broth, a little extra heavy cream, tomatoe and jalapeno flavored cheddar cheese (and even topped to decorate when served), pinch of sugar, Old Bay, and little additional salt and pepper.  Once all of these additions were made to the recipe - it was FANTASTIC!",

I added a TON of stuff: Cayenne creole lemon thyme fresh purple basil old bay zesty seasoned salt with a hint of lime in place of regular salt celery seed red pepper (if you haven't noticed I like my soups SPICY!) I wish i would have had celery to add but i didnt I didn't really add any other vegetables besides the onions. For the meat I loaded it up and used about a lb of imitation crab a lb of jumbo lump crab drained with a little juice left and added to the soup and 3 small pieces of tilapia i sauteed and flaked up in a pan were added to the soup. I also added a dash of reisling wine. Anyways this is an awesome base so use it and get creative make what you like!",
