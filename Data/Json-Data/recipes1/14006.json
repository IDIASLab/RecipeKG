Takes out more than 50% of the fat. Used Italian Seasoned Stewed Tomatoes for a little extra seasoning and I also cooked the peppers a bit longer. Added shredded cheese to the top for the last few cooking minutes. NICE 'N' EASY!",

Although a little more labor intensive than I had imagined the end result was true comfort food. I made a few tweaks to the reciped: Subbed 1/2 cup of meat for Italian sausage and added fresh garlic. The recipe made more than enough for three peppers. I could have easily gotten two more out of it so I froze the rest. This mixture could definitely be made ahead and frozen for a quick dinner.",
