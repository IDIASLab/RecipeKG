Good as written so I am rating this 4 stars for ease, time and ingredients usually on hand.  But for my family's preference I made the following modifications.  Used spiral noodles in place of egg noodles as they capture more sauce.  1/2 ground beef and 1/2 hot italian sausage which gave the casserole more complexity.  Used small pre-sliced pepperoni to save time.  Most importantly, this is a great casserole for making ahead ~ as with many pasta dishes, the flavor gets better the longer it sits.  Overall this is a great base recipe to build on.  Thank you Melissa for sharing!",

I think it's the first time everyone in the family actually all really liked a casserole I made! It was fun to make too. I didn't change anything about the recipe other than I used pre-sliced pepperoni and cut them into quarters. I will definately be making this recipe again and adding it to my family favorites. Next time, though, I think I will add a layer of mozzarella cheese in the middle and on the top since our family really loves cheese. Thanks so much for a GREAT new recipe!",
