Instead of using the bouillon cubes I substituted 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth for 1 cup of the water used to cook the rice.  I also added some black pepper, Italian seasoning and rosemary to the chicken while cooking.  I also added 1 can of drained string beans for more vegetables.  The taste was wonderful.  Added bonus is the one dish meal makes for easier clean up!  This will become a staple meal in our home!",

I then sauteed the mushrooms with the chicken. When I cooked the rice I used 1 can of chicken broth instead of the cubes and an additional 2 cans of water. I also added some cooked broccoli to the mixture - but it didn't seem to make very much of a difference. I think it would have been great without. The only other thing I would change next time would be to make it a little bit spicier - maybe some currie or more cajun.",

However the original recipe is too bland (in my opinion) so I added in a pinch of paprika thyme basil and a good few grinds of black pepper. I also added half a red bell pepper as i had to use it up but i think it added a nice extra flavour and texture to the whole dish. In future I'd put in some diced onion and a little garlic too I think. This is not quite a 5 star recipe as I had to add an extra can full of water with the tomatoes to give enough liquid for the rice to absorb. I will definitely be making this again and again and again!",
