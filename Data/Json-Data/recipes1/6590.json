A couple of tips if you have a springform pan use it! Mine has a tube pan insert so it was perfect. Makes it effortless to unmold this. I noticed several reviews where people were wondering what to do with the butter and crumbs. Just butter the bottom of the pan and scatter the crumbs in shake around and dump out the excess. Vanilla wafers worked great for us. Make sure the pineapple is in syrup not juice the thickness and sweetness is important. Also I think using real whipping cream is a must forget the coolwhip...too thick and artificial tasting. This makes such a pretty dessert perfect for summer cook-outs!",
