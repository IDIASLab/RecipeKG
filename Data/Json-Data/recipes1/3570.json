                "reviewBody": "Authentic recipe & preparation. Injera is tricky to make, but practice makes perfect. Injera is a sourdough flatbread- that's why the dough sits for 24hrs, for the sourdough fermentation process. It is cooked only on one side; the uncooked side stays spongy & soft. And for 'accidentalfoodie': You are correct that teff and millet aren't the same grain. But you are incorrect in that BOTH are gluten-free. Gluten by definition is the protein in wheat. There is no gluten in either millet or teff. Teff is the world's smallest grain- technically a grass, native to east Africa. It can range widely in colors, is very high in fiber & protein, and has a sweety/nutty flavor. Teff is often assumed to be sour, as many recipes/preparations partially or fully ferment the grain (as is the case with this recipe, where it basically becomes sourdough). Millet is a name of a family of grains (also grasses) native to India and central/west Africa. They grow very well in arid regions, have a pearl-like grain, and are mild in flavor and high in protein. Toasting the grain before cooking or grinding for flour can improve the taste. Teff is sometimes considered to be a millet grain (a member of the millet family), but in the US, what is sold as \"millet flour\" is from a different plant than teff flour. Use real teff flour if you can find it-- it will give a more complex/robust taste than millet flour, which is usually pretty bland. But either one will work fine.",

There is even etiquette for eating Ethiopian food (when eating you have to take care to not place your fingers inside your mouth) So yes the bread is bland but you don't just eat the bread.

I wanted to make a couple breads that night so I took about 3 cups of the batter out and added an egg about 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 cup of spelt flour (maybe a bit more). I cooked this batter as I would a crepe and the taste and texture was great for the stew I had with the bread. I left the rest of the batter to sit for 24 hours. When I tried to cook the rest of it the following night it just did not work and the taste was awful. Again I added 2 eggs and about 2 cups of spelt flour and this thickened up the batter and allowed me to cook them (it takes a while for them to cook so wait until the bottom is fully brown and flip them to brown other side). Even after all this I still did not really like the taste but my boyfriend did. My advice: If you try this recipe and get the same results that I did try adding some flour and eggs to the batter so that you don t have to waste it. I also recommend halving the recipe since after adding the flour and eggs it made at least 10 large breads.",
