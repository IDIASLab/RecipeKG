Due to time constraints he cooked it on the stove top and began with two frozen chicken breasts which were cooked in water seasoned with salt black pepper and garlic powder. When the chicken was done he chopped/shredded it removed the fat and began adding everything to the pan including chicken broth. He didn't want to use the liquid the chicken was cooked in. When it came to chile powder he grabbed the 1/2 tablespoon measure instead of the 1/2 teaspoon and we debated then went ahead and used the larger amount. That's the only ingredient we changed and we just ooohed and aaahed because the soup was so good! Another new favorite to add to the soup section of our recipe file. Thank SO much for sharing this. I'll be sure to pass it on.",

Cooked on low for 8 hours. By itself delicious!! Then we started serving it topped with shredded cheese fresh cilantro chunks of avocado and crushed tortilla chips and it was even BETTER!

I didn't have regular chili powder so I put in chipolte chili powder. Didn't have potatoe flakes so I used Wondra or you can reserve some of the chicken broth & thicken with cornstarch or flour in the end to thicken up. My son says it is the best soup I have ever made!
