Had no green bell peppers (we don't really like the bitter taste) so I used a combo of red-yellow-orange mini bell peppers which actually made for a nice presentation. We like dill so I added more of that (I can't imagine that you could even taste 1/2 tsp of fresh dill) and gave it a good sprinkling of freshly ground pepper. I don't think that the grated parmesan cheese ever will melt so don't be tempted to overcook because you'll lose the moisture of the sauce. We really enjoyed this and IMO this is a winner!",
