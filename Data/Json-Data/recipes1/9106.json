I make it with dried herbs as I don't usually have fresh herbs on hand and it turns out fine. Just make sure to decrease the amounts as dry herbs are stronger than fresh. This chicken is best when cooked on the grill as the smoky flavor blends incredibly well with the herbs and balsalmic vinegar. I have made this chicken for a few guests and everyone has said they loved it. It's great served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.",

I put everything into a mini food processor to blend. I pounded the chicken down thin and let it marinate for close to 12 hours. If you're not a fan of balsamic - use white wine or white wine vinegar. This is a great marinade. I've tried so many from this site and this is one of the best. This chicken would be great over pasta!",

When putting such a nice combination of herbs into my blender, I expected a nice, herby, and savory chicken.   Instead, it tasted like balsamic vinegar and nothing else. That is ALL I tasted.  My son was a fan but the rest of us were not impressed.  Next time, I will cut the vinegar in half or perhaps use white wine instead.  It was very simple to prepare though, and has potential.  Definitely do not follow the recipe as written!!!  ;)",
