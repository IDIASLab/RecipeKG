I added  thyme and basil to taste.  Double the amount of the chicken and the asparagus or do equal parts of asparagus and yellow peppers.  I also added 4 chopped roma tomatoes.  Add tomatoes at the very end so they are warm and not cooked.  To the penne I added 3-4 tablespoons of butter with an equal amount of half and half and 3/4 to 1 cup of asiago, romanno and parmesan blend.  This makes the penne creamy.  You could also add sliced black olives if desired.  Salt and pepper to taste and serve.  The extra chicken and vegetables makes this a hearty 1 dish meal.",

I also simmered the asparagus in the white wine with minced garlic, fresh mushrooms, and just a dab of butter for a richer flavor. Then, seeing that previous reviews had dubbed this recipe \"too dry,\" once the pasta was finished, I mixed in Sun Dried Tomato Alfredo sauce (from a jar, I digress) before adding my chicken and vegetables. I threw everything into my largest Pyrex mixing bowl, mixed it, and sprinkled shredded Parmesan cheese over top... and popped it in a 250 oven for 20 minutes. The dish came out FANTASTIC. It was so delicious, my  super picky \"hates everything\" room mate Jim plowed through three servings. I will definitely be making this for my boyfriend to impress him...",

I made some slight variations based on past reviews, but I'm sure it would have been just as good straight from the recipe.  I cooked the chicken in the olive oil, red pepper flakes, garlic, and kosher salt.  When the chicken was about halfway done, I added about 1/4 cup of white wine.  I added the asparagus to the boiling water with the pasta for the last 3 minutes of cooking.  While the pasta was draining, I stirred in halved grape tomatoes into the chicken just to heat them through and then tossed everything together.  I loved this light meal -- it was quick, easy, and delicious!",

This is what I did: I seasoned the chicken lightly with Lawry's Salt before sauteing it then I also doubled the garlic and pepper (I like garlic and spicy foods). I then used about 8-10 ounces of pasta and substituted the asparagus with some other greens (for example buck-choi) and then added the noodles to the chicken mixture and let it simmer in chicken broth. Topped off with parmesan it's excellent!",

Not to mention MY surprise when it all went smoothly...truly a quick and easy recipe. It was delicious and I can't wait to cook again. The only alteration I was brave enought to attempt was to use more than one tbl. spoon of olive oil to saute the chicken and to add a bit of salt while it was sizzling; it added a lot of flavor to the chicken very tasty!",
