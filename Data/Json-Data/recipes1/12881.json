Next time I'll probably make a little extra so I can pack for lunch the next day.  Another great one to add to the recipe box!",

Also I used a pkg of colesalw cabbage and less red pepper flakes. I was skeptical about the sour cream but it really brings this dish together! Served in \"Peppy's Pita Bread\" from this site and the way these were devoured I'd wager that lunch was a hit! Thanks for the neat idea Holly!",

Thankfully I read the reviews before making this and only added 1 teaspoon of red pepper and it was still too hot for the kids to eat! We like spicy foods but even cutting down the amount of pepper it was still spicy. The taste was a great combination. And it was such a quick recipe to make. I WILL make it again but only add a pinch of red pepper.",
