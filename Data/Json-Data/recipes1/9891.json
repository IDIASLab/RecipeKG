I've tried this recipe with store-bought Alfredo sauce before, and we found it way too sweet--mind you, it was because of the paticular sauce we chose.  A quick suggestion if you don't have the ready-made sauce on hand: saute 2-3 cloves minced garlic in some butter, add the mushrooms and saute for 2 or 3 minutes, add 1 tablespoon of flour to 2 cups milk, then add to mushrooms, simmer until thick and then add 1/3 cup parmesan cheese -- voila! A low fat alfredo with delicious mushroom taste!",

Don't forget to scrape the \"gills\" out from the underside of the mushroom that way the sauce won't turn the purple/brown color some people complained about. I added yellow bell pepper zucchini broccoli cherry tomatoes and carrots as well. Then instead of mixing it all together I just spooned the sauce on top of the noodles and topped it with the mushrooms and veggies. Very delicious and beautiful presentation!",

I used the quick and easy alfredo sauce recipe from here(think thats the same one she got from here).  It made a huge difference.  The dish went from a good one to an excellent one.  The sauce definitely transformed it.  I also added mozarella to the top after I was done to make it more cheesy.  We LOVE this recipe now. I think what I made at home was as good or better than the local restaurant version.  I'm glad I have a treadmill.......lotta calories in this one!",

The smell is absolutely disgusting...it reminded me of my baby's infant formula...you know that iron-rich fake milk smell? Needless to say we tried again with a homemade sauce and it was superb. Do yourself a favor unless you have experienced and liked (although I cannot fathom why) the jarred alfredo sauces (even the more expensive ones which is what I bought just to be sure) MAKE YOUR OWN ALFREDO SAUCE!

My only problem was after adding the alfredo to the wine/garlic/veggie mix the sauce was too thin so I allowed it to simmer a bit and thicken up.
