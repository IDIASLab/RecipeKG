I used only one 8 ounce package of angel hair pasta as the recipe yield states it makes 8 servings but using 2 boxes of pasta would yield 16 servings. Using just one box gave plenty of pasta. This turned out pretty well and works great for a quick meal when you only have a little bit of time to throw something together. The kids ate it and didn't complain so that's a win.",
