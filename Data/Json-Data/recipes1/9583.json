I scaled to 9 servings because 3 cups of flour is perfect for my machine. I used all milk 1 tbsp yeast 1 tbsp vital gluten flour 2 whole eggs 2 egg yolks and 1/2 tsp salt. This bread recipe is missing salt which is very important when making bread. When my bread machine beeped at the add in time I added the melted butter then the raisins after it was well kneaded I needed to add at least a 1/4 cup of extra flour as it was quite sticky. I was able to make 4 mini loaves (12 oz of dough each) which baked in 25 minutes. I brushed the loaves with butter as soon as I removed them from the oven as it ensures a soft crust. Usually when I make Easter bread we also put a glaze on I used a scant tsp of orange zest 4 tsps orange juice and a heaping 1/2 cup of icing sugar which I brushed on once the breads were cooled. It smells awesome! My neighbours will be so happy with their little gifts. I made this for the Allrecipes Allstars Canada April Challenge #ARFaceless",
