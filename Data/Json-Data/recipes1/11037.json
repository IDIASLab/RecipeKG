The flavor of this recipe was superior to the traditional boiled corned beef, but the baked corned beef was FAR too tough. In prep for this year's St. Pats feast, I tried boiling the corned beef according to the package directions, then draining it, patting it dry, adding the glaze, and baking it for approx 30 minutes (I turned the broiler on for the last couple of minutes to carmelize the top -- watch it carefully though!!) My family agreed it was the best corned beef they had ever tasted. This will be our St. Pats corned beef recipe from now on.",

I had actually baked the corned beef for 5 hours in 2 bottles of Guiness Beer and then filled the pan the rest of the way with water to cover the meat and added the seasoning packet.  Then I took the corned beef out of the liquid and just left a small amount in the bottom of the pan and added a layer of glaze every 15 minutes for an hour.  I broiled it on high for the last 10 minutes and it ended up coming out so great that even my kids (who would have never eaten corned beef before), loved it.

I put the corned beefs (I cooked 3 of them!) in roasting pans and filled the pans to within an inch of the top with water and added the spice packs that came with the corned beefs.  Then I covered them with foil and put them in the oven at only 250 degrees for 5 hours.  Uncovered them, drained most of the water as well as removed the fat, added the glaze, put my carrots in with the corned beefs, and baked them at 350 for another hour, basting both the carrots and beefs occassionally.  YUMMY, and the carrots were delish, too!  3/18/07 update:  Cut all leftovers into bite-sized chunks, melted butter in large skillet, put in the leftovers (corned beef, carrots, cabbage, potatoes and turnip).  Cooked on medium high, stirring, for a few minutes.  Turned stove to low, covered the skillet, and heated for about 20 minutes - this was SUPER \"corned beef hash\".",

                "reviewBody": "I have not boiled corned beef now for over 2 years.  The corned beef is SOOOOO flavorful. It is very important to wash the brine off the corned beef first (this keeps it from being to salty).  Cover 1/2 way with water and cover. Seasonings are optional.  Cooking times may very, but the slower the better. 200-250 degrees.  I check after 2 hours and go from there.  It is done when the strands start to seperate.  This next step is VERY IMPORTANT!  When the corned beef is done, take the juice and dump into a pot.  Add potatos, cabbage and enough water to cover and boil till tender.  Add carrots and 1/4 inch of water to pan and glaze both the corned beef and carrots. DON\"T BROIL (it will burn).  Bake on 450 for 20-30 minutes.  It will still burn if your not careful, the goal here is to glaze! just be vigilant.  Once the corned beef is glazed remove from pan and set on plate and cover with foil and let sit for 10-15 minutes. If the carrots are not done leave in pan till tender.  Follow these instruction and I guarentee the absolute best corned beef you will EVER have!",
