First, it has to be BUTTER... and nothing but butter.  Margarine cannot be substituted for butter. :)  The second is the beating time.  Personally I abide by the following method: Beat butter by itself for 5 mins.  Add icing sugar and beat another 5 mins.  add flour in 3 equal portions (1/2 C at a time) beating for 2 minutes after additions 1 & 2 and then 10 mins after the last addition.  So thats 14 more minutes than this author says but thats what works for me every time!  As well I bake at 300F for 5-7 mins.  These are absolutely fabulous cookies... they usually never make it to the serving plate! Yummy!",

                "reviewBody": "I make shortbread frequently, and I will say that these cookies are definitely -not- shortbread cookies.  They taste like shortbread, but the butter to flour ratio leans on the butter side, they act much more like a drop cookie than a shortbread. If you're planning to make festive prints or patterns with your press or cutters, try a different recipe.\n\nThey are a good, no fuss alternative to traditional shortbread.\n\nMy experience with the procedure:\nThe dough forms crumbles at the beginning like shortbread.  The color lightens and it becomes more \"fluid\" when enough air has been introduced.  Just keep whipping, you'll be hard pressed to hurt them.  Slow/stop your mixer every minute or so and scrape down the bowl with a spatula to make sure the air-introduction is relatively uniform.  When it's done, it will be about the consistency of a nice buttercream frosting.  You can get fancy with your piping tools instead of cutters or a press.\n\nShortbread cookies, in my experience, are always a little delicate.  I've made big ones before and you always get a few breaks, but there are generally enough people around the house to dispose of them.  \n\nSomeone mentioned the \"puffy\" cookies in the picture.  I think those are either a different recipe, or the person who made them tweaked this recipe by added flour to bring the ratio closer to traditional shortbread (generally 3-4 cups flour per cup of butter).  I don't think this recipe cannot produce cookies like that.",

The flavor is wonderful, but a warning: they are VERY delicate. I followed the recipe to a tee, but baked them for about 14 min (which was perfect for my oven), used parchment paper (helped with easy removal), and added chocolate chips to half the batch. Definitely wouldn't recommend traveling with these cookies, but they'd be great with tea or milk! *EDIT* I made these cookies again and again, and after a lot of experimenting I found that, in order to make it look like the picture, you have to add an extra 1/2 to 3/4 c. of flour to your mix (still beating it in 1/2 c. per 2 min intervals). I tried it first with 3/4 c., but they were a little drier than I would have preferred. I believe a 1/2 c. extra will give just the right consistency with them still keeping their shape. Hope this helps!",

The first batch I cooked for 10 minutes(after reading the reviews) but the cookies just fell apart. So I cooked the next batch until the edges began to turn a slight golden color. Yummy!

I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract I think that is a must have... and I first took 2 squares of margrine and placed it in the micro for about 25 seconds to soften only a little and I wipped it in my electric mixer for about 2 min first ON HIGH and then added the icing sugar still beating on high and 1 cup of the flour on hight and then I sewed in the remaning 1/2 cup flour with my spatula... these really do melt in your mouth... I did'nt think they were difficult... but sometimes when you are new at baking shortbread may not be the best choice... but all in all I love them can't wait to share them with everyone! great recipe william! and thanks for sharing",

I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to this recipe and beat the butter first added the conf sugar and beat that in then the flour and beat for 10 minutes. Cookies looked great and tasted great but I could barely get them off the pan before they would fall apart. I figured they would be easier to handle once they were cooled but they weren't. They fell apart the minute you tried picking them up. They tasted great but I definitely can't make this to serve to people or they would get a plate of crumbs. What a bummer!",
