The formal name is an EMPANADA.  That's the name you should look for when shopping.  Goya Tampas para Empanadas are frozen turnover patties.   Put the mix in the middle, fold, and then take your fork and seal the edges with it leaving little fork imprints along the edges. Beef is very plain tasting, don't cheat yourself....season your meat liberally with garlic powder, sazon, seasoning salt, adobo and, if on hand, you can never go wrong w/ sofrito.  Be creative and add what you like because you really can't go wrong w/ this one....it's only beef in a patty.",

In addition to draining the ground beef well be sure to have the oil hot enough when you start frying or they will soak up too much. 10/1/04 These are also really good using ground chicken instead of ground beef!",
