Changes made are as follows --- used sage pork sausage instead of adding in the 2 tsp of the spice at the end --- only used 1 large granny smith apple --- the onion used was very large so only put 1/2 of it in -- doubled the amount of poultry seasoning --- placed in a 9 x 13 pan and poured a 14 oz. can of chicken broth over the top to keep moist --- covered w/aluminum foil and baked at 325 degree for 30 minutes then upped the temp to 350 removed the foil stirred it and baked for another 30 minutes. Stuffing came out very moist with a crunchy exterior just the way I like it. Next time I might add in a bay leaf or 2 as well.",
