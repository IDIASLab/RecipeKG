                "reviewBody": "Great cake! Easy to make and all ingredients are common so always on hand. I thought the salt was just a wee too much so I reduced it to 1/2 teaspoon. Watch the cooking time as mine was done a little sooner than called for. I also used leftover coffee from the morning in place of the water for a deeper flavor and used chocolate extract in place of vanilla. This cake is even better the next day. Update made this again with the icing which reminds me of a texas sheet cake icing. Most of them are made with powder sugar for a smoother frosting but made with regular sugar wasn't bad. The sugar did melt but becomes ever so slightly crystalized (hardly notice) in spots when cooled. Halfed the icing and spread out thin over top of cake in pan and it was just enough to add a sweet chocolate layer which was enjoyable.",
