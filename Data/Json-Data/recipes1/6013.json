I was concerned that the burgers would give me trouble in the tin foil so I decided to place my very large cast-iron skillet on my gas grill and use that to cook the burgers. I also thought fresh pita bread would make a good substitute for buns in case the burgers fell apart. With this approach I didn't even worry about making them into perfect burgers; instead I just dropped clumps of the refrigerated mix onto the very well preheated skillet (with olive oil) and I also had a wood chip smoker box going to give a little mesquite smoked flavor to the burger clumps. To dress the pita wraps I chopped some fresh tomato and scallions and had wedges of lemon handy to squeeze onto the mix. My wife added fresh spinach as well. This is very healthy! Thanks a million for this recipe. The burgers are so delicious but subtle so I don't recommend putting too much stuff on them. I also found that this is a very low-salt meal if you use the low-sodium soy sauce. My only caveat is to not overprocess the nuts and seeds too much or you get peanut butter which is very good but not easy to remix into the bulgur. Really wonderful. Mike",
