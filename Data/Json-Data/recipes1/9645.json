What's most important about this recipe is the shortening to powdered sugar ratio, which is 1 cup of shortening to roughly 4 c. of powdered sugar, and in my view it's perfect.  Since I tinted my frosting and didn't need it to be pure white I was able to use pure vanilla rather than the clear imitation vanilla (which certainly has its place).  I also didn't add the butter flavoring, preferring just the vanilla flavor.  As I do with all frostings calling for shortening, I used hi-ratio shortening, which can be found in cake supply stores or ordered online.  As for the milk, don't add it all at once!  You may not need it all!  I dribbled it in, little by little, and probably used about half the amount called for.  This was perfect with \"Aunt Bert's White Cake,\" also from this site, but would be suitable for just about any flavor cake.",

I couldn't fathom why this was so highly-reviewed. However after adding 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream and continuing to whip it like crazy the frosting was wonderful! I highly suggest this addition unless you want to feel as if you're eating straight shortening and powdered sugar!",
