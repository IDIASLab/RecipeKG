I wanted to include it but couldn't get to the store so I whipped together cream cheese and some kefir and it worked just fine! Maybe the mascarpone would have been even better, I'll try it sometime, but google substitutions using what you have if that's the only thing standing in your way from this creamy, and delicious pasta meal.",

Did some modifications:  Cut my butternut squash in half, add a pool of water, and baked at 375 for 1.5 hours.  (Since my butternut squash was so large I doubled the recipe).  Once done baking I removed the peel, and started following the directions.  My local grocery store was sold out of mascarpone, so I used reg cream cheese.    I highly recommend baking the squash as it makes for a great sauce (just like regular tomato sauce and spaghetti).  The first time I served it, I did it over whole wheat pasta, the second time I used reg fettuccine - I will only use fettuccine for the recipe moving forward.  I served with garlic toast and Cesar salad!",
