It was very crumbly where I could not form the dough into any sort of a form to bake. I had to add 1 more egg and 2 more tablesoons of butter to the recipe. It then was a little bit wet but just a touch of flour to handle the dough worked fine. I am a bit of a biscotti nut in that I love to bake all different kinds. This BY FAR is the best biscotti recipe I have ever made. Very Authentic in flavor. Thank you so much Rosina for sharing this recipe with us! I will have to always have a batch of these on hand for when unexpected guests arrive!",

When I took them out of the oven after 25 minutes they were very hard to cut and the slices are very jagged. I tried to put them back into the oven for the next 15 minute drying time and they are not that easy to hold their shape. Also way too sweet. Sorry.",

I used to get them all the time at Bleecker St Pastry in Greenwich Village but since I moved and they closed I've longed for them for quite some time. The ones I've bought in other bakeries never measured up so on a whim I tried this recipe. They are just like the ones I used to get chewy and nutty! I even messed up the recipe by incorporating the finely ground almonds into the dough instead of sprinkling on top and adding an extra egg as a result and they were still delicious. Yes the dough IS sticky but the effort is well worth it. These made my Christmas and my husband's too:)",
