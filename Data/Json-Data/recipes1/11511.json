I didnt have a sauce pan big enough to make the cheese mixture and I didn't add as much milk as called for. I used about 3 cups. I really liked the consistency though. It was creamy but just did't have enough cheese flavor. I will try this again with less flour probably a cup and a half and add more cheese probably some sharp cheddar.",
