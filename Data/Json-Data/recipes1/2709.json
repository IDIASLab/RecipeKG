I cooked it at 450 for 10 minutes and then turned it down to 325...Well it took way more than 30 minutes to cook. It took about 1 hour & 15 minutes before it was done. It's not a very firm pie...It's very soft but it cuts up nicely. I tasted it and it's VERY GOOD. If you don't mind waiting for what seems forever...You'll love the outcome. Just be sure to expect a long wait! My grandma said it was the best pumpkin pie that she has ever tasted...And that's saying a lot she is painfully truthful on everything!",

As other reviewers suggested I just kept checking with the knife until it finally came out clean. I agree with one of the reviewers that says the pie tastes much better the next day after chilling in the refrigerator for a night. Next time I will also use more spices than are called for in the original recipe though that is just personal taste.",

Chill it overnight enjoy it cold with some fresh whipped cream and you are going to be in pumpkin heaven!",

So I made this the night before as all suggested. Let it sit in the fridge and this was GOOD. I actually ate 1/2 a piece! Could I have gone without yes BUT for those of us that really hate pumpkin this is at least palatable. My husband on the other hand LOVED LOVED it. So it's a keeper (but if you truly don't like pumpkin don't expect a miracle. You will STILL not like pumpkin.) It makes a lot but I did use a regular pie dish I filled it waaaaayyyy up and still just had a bit left but it made a nice full pie. I don't know how the other reviewers were able to make two those would have been pretty skimply. Also get the vanilla cool whip too on it! Good stuff!",

It had a nice sweet flavor very old fashioned tasting!!!:) However it did require longer cooking time 60 minutes at 325. I took your advice to triple it and ended up with TONS of filling. I was able to make 4 pies and 6 tarts. Maybe using cake pans instead of pie plates would hold more liquid anyhow it was great. Left overnight the flavors blended and it just tasted amazing!!!!!LOVE the taste and texture absolutely perfect thankyou so much for this recipe.",
