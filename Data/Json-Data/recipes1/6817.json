The only part of this dish that really took any time was cooking the chicken. Leftover shredded chicken really makes this a quick dish. I did use a lot less peanut sauce than the recipe called for about 1T per pita. I started out with 2T andI gradually have cut back to 1T as the rest runs off the end when eating. Maybe I need a thicker sauce. Anyway this was terrific and will be made often.",
