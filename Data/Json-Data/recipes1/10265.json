This is a quick work-day dessert that goes together quickly and can bake during dinner or dinner prep. I suspect any fruit baby food would work. The texture was okay (not as dense as I expected) and the fruit made it moist. Great with whipped cream ice cream or a drizzle of icing. Frosting would be too much IMO. This is quite a sweet cake. Next time I will reduce the sugar by at least half but I will certainly be making it again. Once we no longer keep baby food in the pantry I'll sub frozen fruit (thawed) with a splash of water and run through the food processor or blender...or just increase the applesauce. Thanks for the recipe.",
