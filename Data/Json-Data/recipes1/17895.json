I didn't have any white wine vinegar so I used rice wine vinegar and no peanut oil so I subbed 1 tbsp. sesame oila dn 1 tbsp. canola oil...it gave this a nice toasty flavor in the background. I made this earlier in the day to allow the flavors to blend. You can really taste each flavor which is nice. Served this over a simple salad w/ chow mein noodles. Would make this again!
