I again used munster cheese instead of swiss.  I decided to try the gravy and it was good, but I don't think it's necessary as the chicken tastes great alone.\n\nOriginal review: My husband says this is the best new recipe that I've ever made, and he's hard to please.  \n\nI did things slightly different for personal preferences.  First of all, I used Italian bread crumbs instead of Corn Flake crumbs because that's all I had in the house.  I used munster cheese instead of swiss becuase neither of us like Swiss.  And I didn't make the gravy, because my husband isn't a gravy person.  \n\nThese were so simple to make, took little time and turned out wonderfully.  The first time I made this it came out too dry, so I adjusted my cooking temperature the next time to 350, for 30 minutes, and it worked fine.  I will definately make this again!",

One thing that helps is if you fold the ham around the cheese, and then wrap the ham/cheese square in the chicken.  Less cheese oozes out!  \n\nWill definately make again!",

I melt the butter in the 13x9 pan in the micro and then roll the chicken in it and then roll it in bread crumbs and return it to the pan. Very easy.

After rolling the chicken up I sprinkled paprika on the top surrounded it with wedges of butter and let it bake. The second time I made it I was running low on time so I pan seered some seasoning into the chicken first and then rolled it all up and let bake for 25 minutes. The nice thing about not breading the chicken is that I didn't need toothpicks so no worries of the little sticks breaking in the food. When first seering the chicken it made for less flexible meat to roll-up but it worked anyway and my guests loved it!",
