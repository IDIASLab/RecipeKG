I still found it was a bit too much pasta so I added a bit more egg. I am pretty inept with flipping so I cooked this in a cast iron skillet on the stovetop and the put in the oven for about 20 minutes. Came out great. Only thing I would do differently next time is more seasoning. I tasted the mixture and it was fine, but when you take a bite with the pasta after it is cooked, it seems a bit bland.. so next time I'll overseason the mixture so it'll balance out when I eat it",

Baked at 350 for apprx 25-30 min until set. I still think it needs a bit more seasoning so I don't have to rely on s&p (thyme? Sage? Italian seasoning?) but great start and overall I am happy with results but to get an a I need to play around with just a bit....great recipe still!",
