I also fried the bacon first, then removed it from the pan and fried my onion, celery and shredded carrot in the bacon fat.  When they were soft, I added the pork, beef and garlic.  Then I followed it exactly as it was.  I remember watching Emeril on the Food Network and he always fried his \"mirepoix\" (celery, onion and carrots) when he made his sauces and it really made the flavour much better.  Very tasty recipe.",

I have gotten rave reviews each time I have made it, and there is rarely any left.  Even my picky husband loves it.  I brown the bacon first and then remove the bacon from the pan leaving the grease behind to saute the onions in.  I found that when cooking the bacon and onions together, as suggested in the recipe, the bacon never really browns and is kind of soggy and rubbery from all the liquid the onions create while cooking.  I also double the amount of tomato sauce for a little runnier sauce.  I cook the sauce in a crockpot on low setting for the afternoon instead of in a saucepan on the stove.  Great recipe, we really love it!",

I would probably also triple the amount of garlic in the recipe.",

I used 3 oz of pancetta in place of the bacon and I used 4 cloves of roughly chopped garlic.  I sauteed the pancetta along with the olive oil until crispy and then I removed it from the pan.  Then I added the onions, carrots, celery and garlic.  Once soft, I added the mushrooms and about 5 minutes later, I added the meat.  I cooked this until the meat was cooked through, then added the pancetta back to the pan. I added 400 ml of tomato sauce and a large can of San Marzano plum tomatoes along with the wine and broth.  I cooked this for about an hour and a half and added about 1/3 cup of ketchup (you'd be surprised how many professional chef's rely on ketchup to make a classic bolognese taste 'complete').  The end result was really delicious spaghetti sauce that I won't hesitate to make again.",

I did make a few changes that all worked tastily: Cooking the bacon first was a great idea; thanks APRILSNYDER. I used both white Spanish onion and red onion; saut\u00e9ed until well caramelized. I substituted sweet Italian pork sausage for the ground pork; yum. I doubled the amount of celery and next time I'll also halve the carrots and chop them and the onions more finely. IMPORTANT NOTE: The recipe calls for a 6oz. can of tomato sauce - but tomato sauce comes in 8oz. cans I believe the author meant tomato paste which is used to thicken sauces and comes on 6oz. cans. Fantastic - don't forget the fresh grated Parmesan and a sprig of fresh basil for garnish.",
