I have tried many, many recipes but for one reason or another they never quite made the grade (would dry out, develop a crust, etc.).  This recipe is totally what I've been searching for. Used this on an angel food cake for Easter dinner and everyone loved it. This recipe does make a lot of frosting so next time I'll either halve the recipe, make 2 angel food cakes or make one cake and some kind of cupcakes to use up the leftovers. Could possibly be used for the filling in whoopie pies. Many thanks for this recipe!",

How funny is that!:) I could literally eat the whole recipe of icing right out of the mixing bowl with a spoon...it is just that delicious. Don't let the name \"Lady Baltimore Frosting\" fool you; this is basically a 7 Minute Frosting without having to prepare in a double-boiler. (MidwestChef stated this is specifically for the LB cake...phooey you can use it for whatever cake you want!) So with that said have fun baking and enjoy!",
