The hot sauce is always the main ingredient. It would make more sense if the butter and hot sauce were reversed. I would say you would need close to a half cup of hot sauce. The way true buffalo wings are made is to deep fry them first and then put them in a bowl and slather them with the sauce and serve with the blue cheese dressing. That's it--ask anyone in Buffalo. If a recipe sounds ridiculous then alter it!",

Cut everything in half and you'll do fine. There was also waaaaay too much butter. If you use this much you'll waste at least half. Cut that down as well. Then there's not near enough hot sauce. If you just want buttery chicken wings I guess the recipe's okay but if you want buffalo wings - use at least 3 yes I said 3 TABLESPOONS of hot sauce. Outside of all that - it tasted pretty good.",

That is the basic recipe then the ratio of these two ingredients to each other are adjusted according to how hot you like your wings and how hot your hot sauce is. Also-wings can vary greatly in size some very small and some so huge you'd think they were turkey wings. Average wings fry about 15 min. at 375 degrees to be done without the additional oven time so if your wings are huge fry them longer maybe 12 minutes before you bake them. These are good wings even without the S&P. I like to sprinkle them with cayenne pepper and a little garlic powder before frying.",

Frank's is pretty salty and so is salted butter. My lil mistake. The blue cheese dipping for me at least came out awesome. If you don't have a deep fryer like myself or don't want to use a lot of oil. About half a cup in a frying pan high heat. Do not overcrowd your pan it will drop the tem and your wings will be soggy.
