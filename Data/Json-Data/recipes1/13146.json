I put it in a bread bowl with bread and cracked pepper breadsticks to dip but it's so good it even tasted great on saltines! Don't serve it ice-cold -- let it soften up before serving. Thanks Idgie! UPDATE: Tried making it with whipped cream cheese -- it's even creamier! Took it to the staff lounge at school -- it didn't last past 11 a.m.",
