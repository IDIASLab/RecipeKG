I just threw EVERYthing into the blender at the same time. I ended up with alot of froth and the ingredients seperated in the popsicle molds. I only had 2 popsicle molds (8 popsicles total) and had tons of mix left over. I think the servings on this is quite a bit off. We ended up drinking the rest (which was also good)  I personally thought they were a bit too tangy. I puckered my lips with the first bite. All the kids loved them so the recipe gets a 5 star!",
