Please keep in mind that the description specifically states that these are cakelike cookies. They are not supposed to spread out but rather stay in a mound when baked. The only problem I ran into was the baking time. I had one tray of cookies that appeared done (after 14 minutes) but when cooled were still a little too gooey inside. I may try baking at 375 F next time. Thanks for a great recipe!",
