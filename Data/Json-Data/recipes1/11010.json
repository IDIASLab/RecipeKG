I love cardamom, but I have to admit that I'm not really sure it went well in this recipe.  I think almond extract would probably go better.  I used an airbake sheet and a silicone mat and had beautiful golden crisp meringues in about 75 minutes at 285 degrees (my oven runs a little cool).  The texture was light and wonderful.  It would make an excellent base for a layered fruit and cream dessert or to make a bowl or base for ice cream, although I would definitely decrease the sugar.  The texture was less of a meringue and more of a light airy biscuit.",

I also adjusted the oven temp to 250 when I noticed the cookies were beginning to crack and leaving them in for only an hour cooked them completely. While I was beating the egg whites I never did get really stiff peaks so I tried adding 1/8 tsp cream of tartar in the hopes it would set up better but it must have been really humid in my house because the most they could muster was a little stiffer than a soft peak which made the cookies flat like medallions instead of pointy like kisses. They still tasted great (gourmet even!) but next time I think I'll only add 1/2 tsp cloves because 3/4 tsp gives the cookies a little too much bite.",

I'm used to cooking with it in asian/Indian dishes used as a flavor enhancer. But I guess you can use any flavoring (mint amaretto) and get great mereingues from it. Great for a low-carb snack if you have to prepare one for a pot-luck or something.",
