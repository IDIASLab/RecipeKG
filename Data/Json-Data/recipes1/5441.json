I made it twice using frozen \"deep dish\" crusts and filled them both each time; the berry mixture even bubbled over both times too while cooking. If using freshly grated orange zest you may wish to decrease the amout called for as it was very stong. The second time I made it I used dried orange zest and it was perfect. With those two comments in mind this is hands down the est strawberry rhubarb recipe I have ever made or tasted. I highly recommend the optional crumb top; it sets it apart from all other recipes!",

I made this with a lattice top and it looked wonderful! UPDATE 9/2/2018: over the years I've been reducing the amount of sugar I cook with. I've reduced the sugar in this recipe to 3/4 cup of sugar. The tartness of the rhubarb and strawberries really pops without so much sugar to compete with. Love love love!",

I added less sugar to the fruit and to the topping as I prefer the sweetness of the fruit to shine thru. I also cooked them about 10 minutes longer and they still were not very brown so I upped the temp. back to 205 for 5 minutes. I also used a sourcream dough recipe from Canadian Living. As they sit right now they look runny oh yeah I used 6 TBS. flout instead of tapioca(didn't have any)....not sure if that's why?? Can't wait to cut into one they smell horribly good;) They thickened upon cooling and yep they were horribly good. The orange zest was a good touch also put a pinch of nutmeg in topping.",
