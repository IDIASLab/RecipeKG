I've made several homemade versions over the years (it's hubby's yearly birthday request), and this by far has gotten the best reviews.  This last time around I made just a few changes, and it was incredibly moist and got huge raves:  used the larger box of pudding, almost doubled the cocoa, subbed 1 1/2 cups of sour cream for the buttermilk and subbed melted butter for the oil.  It made for a really thick batter, so just makes sure to spread the batter around the pans evenly (otherwise you'll end up with lopsided cakes!).  Also a big fan of making this in a bundt pan and pouring the icing over top.  Thanks for sharing, it's definitely a keeper for us!",

After comparing recipes for the frosting I find that most are similar except that many only use 8 ounces of evaporated milk instead of the full can which is 12 ounces like this recipe calls for. I followed the recipe exactly until I got to the frosting. I then mixed only 8 ounces of evaporated milk in the pan with the other ingredients. With the rest of the evaporated milk I added a couple of teaspoons of cornstarch and then mixed it in the bubbling frosting insuring that it would be nice and thick. I then removed from heat added vanilla pecans and coconut.",

I like to use chocolate instant pudding instead of vanilla, and I used 1/2 cup oil instead of 1/3 cup to make it a bit moister.  The batter will turn out incredibly thick and compact.  You'll have to spoon the batter into the cake pans instead of pouring.  For the topping, even though it seems to be runny while you are cooking it, don't worry, when it cools down and you add the nuts and coconut, the topping will thicken up enough.  Also after refrigerating the cake to make the topping set, I like to cover the sides with chocolate frosting using the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe from this site.  That covers the sides nicely and makes for a beautiful cake!",
