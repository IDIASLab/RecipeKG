I experimented, thinking maybe the extra yeast was called for because it was a rapid bake (the recipe doesn't specify a bread machine setting after all), but even in rapid back the full amount of yeast lifted my bread machine lid off.  reducing the recipe by a whole tsp. is definitly necessary to get a better loaf, and I personally like how it cooks in your basic bread/white bread setting best.",

I have made this 2x and 1 of the times I followed it as is except for substituting 1c of whole wheat flour for all purpose flour.  I didn't use bread flour either time i made it.  When I used the wheat flour I kept the yeast at 2 1/4t & it worked perfect.  It is a large loaf though.  I have a larger loaf pan w/ straight sides & it worked perfect in this pan (not sure the exact dimensions).  I will add a little more sugar I think next time.  It's a little 'sour' from the cottage cheese.  The other time I made the recipe (with all, all-purpose flour) I used 1 1/2t yeast & did add 1T more sugar & it turned out perfect.  Though, again, I did use my large loaf pan, as it does make a large loaf.  So......my suggestions would be to add about 1T more sugar & if you use all-purpose or bread flour you could probably cut the yeast to 1 1/2t.  If you use some wheat flour (I suppose because it's more heavy??) I would use the recipe amt (2 1/4t) of yeast.  A great recipe though.  It's definitely in my mix of bread recipes.",
