I have used one teaspoon vanilla extract, real not imitation, and one teaspoon almond extract. You can also flavor these cookies with rum, frangelico, kahlua, or any of your favorite spipping spirits. Sift your sugar and your flour to make your cookie dough light in texture, before and after baking.\r\n",

They were delicious!  They had great flavor and did not crumble or fall apart when baked.  This is an overall great cookie recipe.",

I even received raved review from the girls I work with.  Thank you for such a yummy recipe.  I have to say that I have had wedding cookies in the past that were awful.  This is the perfect recipe!  Merry Christmas!  I made these again this year and they were still excellent.  I used pecans and walnut together and I only baked them for 8-10 minutes maybe because my cookies were smaller.  These are addicting!!",

Commonly known as Russian Tea Cakes they are also referred to as Mexican Wedding cookies. I made the batch twice -once following the recipe the second making some subtle changes. Here are the changes I made. I swapped the regular sugar out and replaced w/ 10x confectioner sugar -this produced a smoother texture. I left out the water and added 1/4 tsp of salt. I reduced the amount of nuts to 3/4 cup and replaced the almonds with pecans. I also added 1 TBSP of vanilla caramel powdered dairy creamer to the powdered sugar when I rolled the cookies in it...and WOW is all I can say! The first batch was good (a 3.5 star rating) but I enjoyed the second batch better thus the five star rating",
