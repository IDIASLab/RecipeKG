Here is what I did to come up with a topping for the New York Cheesecake III on this site:\n\n*  I didn't have fresh strawberries on hand, so I used a 16oz. bag of frozen strawberries.  I started by cutting them all up into smaller chunks.\n\n*  I added 3/4 of the strawberries into the saucepan along with the sugar.  I started to cook this on medium and let it go, stirring from time to time, for about 25 minutes.\n\n* Next, I used an immersion blender to smooth the mixture out.\n\n* Finally, I added the remaining stawberries and let them cook for about 3 minutes.  Added the vanilla at the very end.\n\nThis was the hit of the toppings I supplied with the cheesecake.  The amount of sugar worked very well for 16oz of strawberries - not too tart, not too sweet.",

Delicious over cheesecake, ice cream or pound cake, this is equally as good prepared with frozen strawberries as well as fresh. For a little variation, I sometimes like to add a little berry liqueur such as Creme de Cassis or Chambord, but if you ask hubs this is perfect as is! On this occasion I used this to top \"Perfect Cheesecake Everytime\" and found that for this purpose I wanted the topping thicker so I thickened it with a bit of cornstarch and it was just what I was after. Also, since the strawberries I used this time were HUGE and very meaty, I mashed them coarsely and added a few drops of red food coloring to make the sauce more vibrant red.",

My son likes the strawberry pancakes that Shari makes, but I can't justify paying $5 for something I can make better at home. This doubles really well and is simple enough for the kids to help make. Plus, it tastes better than the Shari's topping. IMO. I'll for sure make this again. UPDATED REVIEW: I have made this strawberry topping over and over again. I usually always double it, I use organic strawberries and pure vanilla extract. Besides using as a pancake topping, I like making this as a cheesecake topping. Specifically, Cheesecakemama's Perfect Cheesecake Everytime. Whenever I pair those two recipes together, people always ask for seconds and the recipes.",

I cooked the sauce until it was as thick as I like it (maybe about 10 minutes)Than I took everything in the pan and pureed it in a blender.
