It gave some of the heat of mustard with out overwhelming the taste of the lamb. I skipped the flour.  Instead of just laying garlic slices on it, I cut pockets into the lamb and put the garlic slices in there.  I also added a bit of Rosemary, Basil and Thyme.  Not a lot, just enough to add a hint of herb flavor.    I also added the herbs and mustard and everything about an hour before cooking so it would have some time to soak into the meat.  My husband loved it, as did I.",

CHANGES: We love garlic so in addition to the fresh cloves I mixed in garlic powder with the flour to add extra flavor. Used dijon mustard instead of prepared. Added several \"dashes\" of Worcestershire sauce. GRAVY TIP: I added about 1/2 c of water to the roasting pan about 15 minutes before the roast was done. It will slowly cook with the flour and juices already in the pan so that when the roast is done you can just sieve the remaining liquid and get a really great \"jus\" to serve over the lamb. Served with roasted lemon potatoes and tomato salad. Will make again.",
