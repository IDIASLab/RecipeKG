After you spread the filling over the dough, pick of the end of the cloth and gently pull letting the dough roll over on itself.  You'll be able to get the dough paper thin and reduce tearing. Also, grind the walnuts into a paste instead of chopping them, this will keep them from ripping the dough.  This dough is exactly like the recipe I use.  The filling is a little diff.  I've noticed many variations.",

For best results, follow tips posted: chop nuts in a food processor to an almost paste-like consistency, roll dough on a floured table cloth.  You want it VERY thin! Dough should be about 55\" x 35\".  Here is my tip:  As you are rolling the dough/filling, prick w/something very thin (I use a cake tester from Pampered Chef).  Keep making several pricks across the length of the dough after every turn.  This will keep air out and prevent the dough from getting thick as it bakes.  The end result will be a nice, tight spiral.  Follow these tips and you will have a DELICIOUS potica!!\r\n\r\nIf anyone has a recipe for a chocolate potica that does not contain nuts, please let me know.  Thanks!!",

With several grandchildren it was an honor when we were old enough to learn this art. It is a time consuming recipe but well worth the effort. We have always used pecans but walnuts would be a less expensive alternative. There are also some minor differences in this recipe and the one I grew up with. It's bitter sweet to see this recipe posted as my family has always kept it a secret but it really is good enough to share. This bread gets better and better the more you make it. TIP: don't over-knead and try to use as little flour as possible.",
