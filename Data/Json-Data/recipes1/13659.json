I followed directions exactly only finding that the clove spice was very overpowering even though we like clove. I was able to correct that by adding some sugar and cumin. You can subsitute the cinnamon and clove with coriander and cumin. Cubans also add raisins - which does add to the flavor! This dish is sometimes used as a filling for tacos and empanadas - it is a very flexible dish. You can make it into a stew by adding corn etc. We enjoy this dish as much as we enjoy good old American chili. Tonite I served it with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream on the side. Red wine or cold beer go great with it. Thanks submitter.",

I am a very picky eater and far from adventurous so for me to try this was a real stretch. I scaled this down to 2 servings and this turned out so wonderful. I loved every delicious bite! I did add some raisins in. I used white wine vinegar and canned diced tomatoes I had leftover in the fridge but in my haste I didn't read about adding them after the 10 min simmer however it didn't seem to affect the end result. I served this with steamed basmati rice and it was so good I even had seconds. The meat was tender and soft and this was so flavorful!!! Thanks JRICE this is fabulous!",
