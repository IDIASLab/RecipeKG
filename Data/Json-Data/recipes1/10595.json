I baked the No roll crust for 10 minutes prior to filling. I used the whole filling recipe in this one (large) crust. The crust was wonderful and the filling for the pie was incredible! I didn't have walnuts in the cupboard so I substituted chopped roasted pecans for the topping. I baked it about 5 minutes longer than it called for and added about 1 tsp of additional corn starch as I was concerned about a runny filling with such a deep pie. The texture and consistency turned out perfectly but did require refrigeration for the full 4 hours to \"set\" in the middle. I couldn't be happier to have this \"go to\" recipe in my kitchen. Thank you so much for sharing!!",
