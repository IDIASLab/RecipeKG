I cooked three large chicken breasts (not pounded)with the mixture in a large foil pouch on 325 degrees. After 35 minutes the breasts were still pretty raw so I turned up the hear to 385 degrees for another 15 minutes. The chicken was tender and flavorful even though it was cooking for a long time. So if you do it this way turn up the heat to 375 for about 30 minutes. I also put the dish over orzo with fresh spinach and pine nuts mixed in and a little parmesan. Yummy my family ate it up!

I used chicken breasts and seasoned them with salt and a generous amount of fresh ground black pepper. Smeared them with fresh minced garlic and topped them with the fruit cocktail teriyaki sauce and raisins. Bake them in the pouches for 35 minutes let them rest and then topped them with coconut. Yummy. But like one reviewer said if you have to change it that much it's not the same recipe. It's still a great concept.",

I also covered the dish while it was baking. Overall it turned out really well. It was very tender and I would certainly try the recipe again using different seasonings. I rated this a 3 only because it will require some experimentation with seasonings to make this recipe complete. I would certainly recommend it for a quick meal after a long day.
