She schmeared the meat on the bread, covered it with cheese and then placed it under the broiler so the cheese would be melted. It's quite cheap to make and benefits from your own choice of spices and the addition of onion and garlic. The original calls for american or processed cheese but it works with just about any cheese you have on hand. GREAT boy food.",
