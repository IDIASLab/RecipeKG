There is no science here...use whatever herbs you have on hand or whatever your preference is. No need to measure just chop and add fresh herbs (or throw in a pinch or two of dried) to your liking. It was a nice change from the garlic and olive oil pasta I traditionally serve. I omitted the olives and served with Jerusalem Chicken II also from this site. Simple and delicious.",
