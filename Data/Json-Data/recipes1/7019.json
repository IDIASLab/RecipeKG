When making these dumplings, I work the opposite, I have the eggs in the dish and keep adding flour to the egg. It MUST be the perfect mix or they do not come out correctly, but trust me once you get it, they are the best, much better than oven roll dough. When you are mixing these, you take some mixture onto the spoon, if it falls off quickly, add more flour, until the mixture almost needs a push with your finger to get off the spoon into the hot broth.  When you add it to the broth, if it explodes, the mixture is too wet. Give it another try....this is a great recipe, you will enjoy  Lana's family treasure.",

I thought out removing the dumplings and making them from another receipe but changed my mind. When it says make the dumplings small it means...make them pea size! These were the worst tasting dumplings I have ever tried. I then added a chopped up onion some poultry seasoning chopped garlic parsley lot of salt and pepper. I continued cooking them on low for another hour. The flavor got better on the soup part but the dumplings are something to be desired unless you like hard rubber. Blah! Can biscuits make better dumplings. If this family grew up beleiving these were dumplings they would think that they had died and gone to heaven if they had the real thing. Sorry never again.

This recipe was so simple for me and it turned out fantastic... I noticed the dumplings were way too dry after adding all the eggs maybe large eggs would of been better but I only had 4 eggs so I substituted another egg with a 1/4 cup milk and added two packs of chicken gravy mix instead of the boullion cubes turned out fantastic... I've made this meal 4 times now and every time it's been a success for me....",

I didn't do this the first time and it was still wonderful. The second time I used a bit too much water and wanted to try and thicken it up. I didn't know it was going to give it such a wonderful added flavor. Recommended!",
