I guess the salad kind of spoiled us, because it is sort of \"zingy\" from balsamic vinegar.  This recipe was good, and I feel everyone should have some \"desperation\" dinners they can pull out of the pantry and have ready in a few minutes. However, this was was a little bland for us.  DH actually put some balsamic vinegar on his, and he said he liked it better.  It's a pretty dish, without any heat, but I would add lime instead of lemon, some garlic and a few drops of balsamic vinegar to liven it up a little.",

I often bulk it out a bit by using more onion a couple of different colored peppers etc; adding a can of pinto beans doesn't hurt either.
