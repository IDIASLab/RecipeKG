BTW...red lentils are the quickest to cook.  I used 1 c. of lentils instead of the 2/3 c. and used 2 c. of chicken stock and it came out perfect.  And the lentils completely cooked in 15 minutes!  Also, red lentils tend to disintegrate when cooked so they're perfect for this recipe since you don't have to mash them!  If you use green lentils you can count on doubling the stated cooking time.",

Made pico de gallo and guacamole to go with it and we scarfed this down!  I cooked my lentils down with brown rice and I think that was a good choice for us.  3/4 cup lentils  3/4 cup brown rice  4 cups 'beef' broth.  I will most certainly be making this again and again.",

I, too, used homemade taco seasoning and veggie broth for our Meatless Monday dinner. Since I was serving this to our 5 year-old DD, I used an organic mild salsa from Muir Glen to taste. Meat-loving hubby enjoyed this too, and we both thought the lentils would also make a yummy filling for bean quesadillas as well.  Used soft taco shells (personal preference), quesadilla queso (what I had on hand), shredded lettuce, guacamole (and a little extra hot salsa for me & the hubby), these were delicious, nutritious, and a cinch to get on the table.  Will 100% make again and will happily recommend to others!",
