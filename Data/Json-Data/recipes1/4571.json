Then I manipulated it with a floured spatula as I went along rolling it up. When it separated or thinned I patched it up with my floured fingers. Next I used dental floss to cut the jelly roll. It cut easily and I scooped up the slices with the floured spatula. Instead of using a muffin tin I created about 7 rolls that I laid flat on a buttered cookie sheet. I cooked them at 345 for 24 mintues. Next I combined powdered sugar a bit of orange juice and a tad of corn starch for the icing. The corn starch keeps the icing from being too sticky and it hardens on the rolls like you see in the stores. All and all a high-maintenance good recipe that skips the yeast! Yeah! Yummy stuff.",
