Would recommend other spices than cumin since not everyone likes it - garam masala and fresh cilantro Italian seasoning or my favorite Hungarian paprika both sweet and hot. Found that it needed to simmer a bit longer about 25 minutes. Added a pinch of sugar to counteract acidity a bay leaf (remove at the end of cooking) and less veg broth 1 carton 1 cup of water. If you have fresh parsley add some to the soup at the table. Excellent use of green tomatoes if you're not into frying or canning/pickling them!",
