I swapped vanilla for the almond extract and added a few soy-lecithin free chocolate chips. The hardest part was getting them off the cookie sheet. If cooled they were stuck. If removed when warm they broke apart and had to be reformed on the rack but then were fairly solid when completely cooled. Tasty and I would make again.",

Since there seemed to be excess liquid in the bottom of the bowl and they didn't hold their shape on the baking sheet and the outer edge was mostly liquid which burned before the center baked I guess waiting overnight may be necessary. I baked half on a silpat and half on a well greased cookie sheet. The silpat released fairly easily it was a struggle to get them off the other sheet. I ended up trimming the dark edges offhand shaping them more or less into balls while they were still warm. The taste was okay warm we'll see how they taste tomorrow.
