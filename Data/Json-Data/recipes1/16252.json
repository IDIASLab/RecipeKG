I didn't understand in the directions about dividing the dough into small balls. This dough can't be made into balls; maybe they meant for it to be like a drop biscuit, I'm not sure. I looked up some other recipes on how to make rusks. You are supposed to put all the dough in the pans. After the first baking, you slice them and place the pieces on a baking pan. I did this, and they turned out rather well. I cut the recipe to 50 servings. I put the batter in a large round pan and cut about 36 rusks.",
