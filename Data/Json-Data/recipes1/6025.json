However I took my chances and I am so glad I didn't let those \"bad\" reviews deter me. The only piece of advise I can give is to TAKE YOUR TIME. If you follow the directions and take your time measuring out everything you cannot mess this cake up. I baked the cakes made the pudding (only used 1 1/4 cup of cold skim milk) waited for the cakes to cool completely. Then I assembled the cake with the pudding (not messy at all). I bought the new microwavable frosting and poured it ALL over the top of the cake and then slowly spread the frosting to drip off of the edges. It looked silly so I just frosted the sides perfectly and added some colorful sprinkles. LOOKS PERFECT. The only reason I gave it four starts was because I haven't tried it yet. It might appear delicious but I never judge a book by it's cover.",

A little advice keep everything refrigerated even the cakes until you are ready to put it together. Definetly heat the frosting in the microwave for a minuet and then pour over the cake. Make sure the cake is on a big enough dish so the frosting doesn't go everywhere. Also cut the pudding down to 1 cup of milk. I gave it 4 stars because it is a little messy but if you keep it cold it comes out perfect. Just make sure to refrigerate cake when you are done!:0)",
