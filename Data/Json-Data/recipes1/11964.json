Easy to make and looks impressive in a trifle bowl, but truthfully, the overall taste is a bit unsophisticated.  Also, the ingredients are too much to fit in a standard 3 qt trifle bowl.  One  package of pudding and 1 tub of cool whip would have been plenty.  The best part was the kahlua soaked cake.  Maybe I'll try this again but use a homemade pudding and real whip cream instead.",

I was a little short on time and I didn't need a huge bowl of it so...I bought Entenmann's brownie bites cut them into cubes and placed them in a bowl. I kind of swished Kahlua on them (coffee flavored liquer) let it soak in. I made whipped cream rather than use cool whip (but I'm sure cool whip is fine). I also found Heath Crumbles in my baking section of the supermarket with the chocolate chips. TA DAH. Rather than make a big bowl I used 2 water goblet type glasses and layered everything in there. Looked very appetizing and my friend loved it. I only made 1 pkg of chocolate pudding and I would say it would make 3 \"water goblet\" desserts.",
