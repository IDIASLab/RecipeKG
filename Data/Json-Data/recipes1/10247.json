Here's an important tip I found while making this: Don't melt your chocolate too hot because you don't want to pour really hot chocolate over the marshmallows. It will make it too runny. Make sure the chocolate is just a little warm before you pour. It helps it to stay nice and firm. Not gooey. Thanks so much for the recipe it's the best!",

I'm so glad I went with this recipe instead of making a fudge recipe from this site. These are like a peanut cluster fudge. I read one of the other reviewers comments that it did not \"set\" for her; but I had no such problem. After chilling for two hours they were delicious!! Creamy Yummy! I did not use marshmallows I just added a 16oz can of Walgreens lightly salted peanuts; I thought the sweet/salty combo would be good and it is! Just the perfect taste. Thanks for a great recipe...super easy and super delicious. It's killing me not to eat them all and save some for Christmas cookie trays!!",

I also added raisins.I too dropped them individually onto parchment paper. The only bad thing about this recipe is that they don't last long!Thanks so much for sharing.",

They looked like \"little soft fudge candies.\" However the end result was what looked like and somewhat tasted like a bowl of sticky chocolate frosting lightly coating lots of marshmallows and some nuts. The coating was way too thick and there was too many marshmallows and nuts. As a result the mixture was difficult to mix or shape into anything. Marshmallows come in 10.5 oz bags so even using less marshmallows there still was not enough of the thick chocolate mixture to coat the ingredients. I finally stuck the mixuture in the freezer to harden it slightly. After about an hour I could scoop it into globs but they were still quite sticky and appeared like nothing more than small piles of marshmallows completely visible and lightly mixed with some chocolate frosting. It would take at least another full bag of melted chocolate to re-dip these and turn them into actual candy!",
