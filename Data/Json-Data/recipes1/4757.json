Substitute pineapple juice instead of lemon juice (it's the perfect compliment) and add the juice directly to melted butter. Last but not least I personally recommend using plantains in lieu of bananas - you're guaranteed not to have mushy results as some reviewers have reported. Frozen plantains are available in your grocer's freezer and may be added to the chicken 1/2 through the allotted baking time. If you think it sounds like an interesting flavor combination -- I believe with the above tweaks it's truly 5-stars!",

Next time I make it I'll use only 3 lbs of chicken and I'll put the ingredients straight into the baking dishes when preparing them. My family loved the taste. I might use crushed macadamia nuts instead of corn flakes next time. Overall it's a keeper!",

I modified it a little - instead of sweetened condensed milk I mixed half sweetened condensed milk and half cream of coconut (like the kind you use to make pina colada). It turned out fabulous. Served this with sweet german wine. Yummy. I LOVE the bananas. I think that the baked bananas would make a great desert with ice cream!!!",
