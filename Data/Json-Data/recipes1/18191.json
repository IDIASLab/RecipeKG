I added a little bit of cornstarch as well just to thicken it up even more. I poured it over some chicken to bake, then poured the pan drippings over rice.

Other then that I made these today and they were pretty straight forward. I have not done much canning before and for a first time solo these were a good start. I tasted some prior canning and was very pleased. Fewer jars then expected was both good and bad, good because it means I can make another batch if I want without having more then I could ever use. 10 lbs of zucchini was only 1week of harvest. Bad because I had taken time to prep slot more jars then needed. 3 stars because of that.",

The only other issue is that this will not make 3 quarts or pickles more like 1 1/2 or 2 at best. The brine was the perfect amount for 2 quarts. I don't have canning equipment so I stopped after step 3. I then let jars rest until sealed then will refrigerate until they are eaten.

If I don't have quite enough poundage of zucchini I combine it with sliced cucumbers. Basically you need 1-1/2 cups of vinegar and 1 cup sugar with each pound of zucchini so I try to do batches of 3# of zucchini to make the canning process more worth the work. I like to use part white vinegar and part ACV but I should warn you that the hot ACV will stain your counter so be sure and protect your counter unless you don't mind doing some heavy scrubbing with baking soda.",
