( using the calculator for ALL RECIPES, i did alter the recipe to make 30 buckeyes) ...everything works together well and tastes even better.  i highly recommend this to first time chocolate dippers and remember that when you are dipping,  slightly tilt your rolled peanut butter ball to keep it on the toothpick.  i have had so many compliments on the taste as well as their appearance...this is definetly a bookmarker on my favorites.",

I scaled the recipe back to 9 servings and easily got 18-20 1\" sized balls. I also put them in the freezer for 5 minutes before coating. Used a melting candy chocolate to cover instead of using shortening and semi-sweet chocolate. To give a different twist I dipped some in a white chocolate candy coating on one side, stuck in the fridge for a few minutes, then covered the other side with the chocolate.  Family LOVED the new twist!",
