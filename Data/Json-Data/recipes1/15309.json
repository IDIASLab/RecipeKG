Since I had tinted it pink it looked EXACTLY like I had made the Barbie's dress with Silly Putty! It flowed down the sides of the cake and the effect was awful. I guess I should remember that great baking rule do not experiment when it's a special occasion but I was looking for a good alternative to too sugary buttercream. Should have just sweetened some whipped cream and had done with it.",
