We didn't have tomatoes so I substituted tomato sauce and I didn't have cumin seeds so I used the stuff in the jar. Overall I think it was good I think it would've been better with fresh tomatoes but it was a keeper. I put some of the sauce over my oregano chicken I made that same night and it was devine!",

We both love cumin and garlic and found these to go very well with the beetroot. I changed the method slightly by precooking the beets and making the \"sauce\" seperately. I then added the beets to the sauce. Went very well with grilled pork chops. Have to note though that all ingredients were freshly picked from our veggie garden and pork produced on our farm - all natural stuff!!!!",
