First change was the crust...I mixed all the ingredients and it was not a consistency for rolling into balls so added another egg and some water.  I then baked the crusts for 10 minutes which seemed too long when I took them out of the oven...they got very crunchy but after having the filling in them softened up a little.  Next time I will check them after 5 minutes.  The coconut filling is awesome!  After reading the other review about the chocolate topping not setting up I decided to add less milk to the mixture, next time I will double the amount of chocolate topping because I had to make more.  With all that said these were awesome! Everyone loved them and their were many request for the recipe.  Thank You, Patty!",

Like the other reviewers suggested, I def recommend adding the extra egg to the fudge cake batter, cutting back on the milk in the chocolate topping, and pressing your thumb in the cups while taking them out of the oven.  Also, bc not everyone in my family likes coconut, I substituted graham crackers for coconut in half the marshmellow mix, keeping the rest of the recipe the same...they turned out like little s'more cups.  These were gobbled up so quick I had to make more for the true event!!",

When I took the lined mini muffin tins out of the oven the dough had risen so there was little room to put the coconut filling. Then after topping them I waited 4 hours for the chocolate almond mixture to harden up so I could store them and it never happened. I was very dissapointed and could not leave them not touching one another so I had to throw them out. (after spending over 1.5 hours in prep time.) Sigh!",

First when the little cakes bake they pretty much fill the entire muffin opening. And if you don't push them back down immediately after they come out of the oven they get hardened like that very quickly. I followed the instructions of keeping the filling warm to fill the chocolate molds and if you don't it begins to separate and the coconut falls to the bottom. At this point in the recipe it should tell you to chill the cups before adding the chocolate topping. I added the chocolate on top of the warm filling and it just ran all over the pan making a huge mess. After doing 3 cups I stopped put the pan in the fridge and chilled for about 30 minutes. Then I came back to a slightly thickened chocolate glaze and added it onto the chilled coconut filling. This worked much better. In the end the chocolate cups were kind of hard and crumbly and the filling is extremely sweet. But after my changes they did turn out very pretty with some sliced almonds on top. Too many steps too much work and not a great finished product.",

I used paper liners but just rolled the balls and dropped them into the liners. Also Ladies to address the comments about only getting X amount of treats remember we're talking inches in female mentality. An inch is an inch and I got 52-60 treats. I baked them for 9 minutes but oven temps vary. Dido on pressing a thumbprint after they come out of the oven. I did let them cool for a few minutes before carefully taking them out of the muffin tin to let them firm up a bit. That way it frees up the tins for a second batch since I only have two tins.
