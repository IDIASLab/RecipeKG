Day 3 it is 5 stars for sure.\nGreat cake to make ahead of time for parties when you have lots of other stuff to make, since it is best on it's 3rd day.\nThanks for this great recipe.\nAlso, just to warn you, it looks ready before the boiling water and you therefore might forget it, just a note to keep in mind.",

I think the trick to the cake is watching your oven temperature and checking on the cake regularly. The first time my cake came out dry but the second time round, I lowered the temperature and kept checking every 15 mins or so. It turned out chocolatey and moist. Somehow I feel it wouldn't be so chocolatey if I hadn't included a bag of chocolate chips along with more coco powder and a frosting. Still a good recipe and keeper! Made it for a camp and it was gone in seconds! :) PS: I would highly recommand lining your tin with baking paper cause the cake tends to stick.",

I followed the mix directions exactly but I made cupcakes instead. 24 cupcakes took 16 minutes at 350 in my oven (which tends to cook a little slow). I ran out of cupcake liners so some of them baked directly in the pan with cooking spray. I had no problems whatsoever with sticking to the pan. I did not think that they looked done but the toothpick was clean so I took them out anyway and they are perfect. This is not extremely chocolate-y or rich so you will have to make some additions to get that. BUT it IS a good basic chocolate cake mix--fairly light texture medium moisture level. And yes it is the recipe right off the Hershey cocoa box.",

I used a large 9x13 pan and when I checked my cake at exactly a half hour baking time, it was jiggly in the middle. SO, I turned the cake (which friends told me to do in a gas oven so it cooks evenly, covered the top with foil so it would not burn and set the timer for another 30 minutes. It was perfectly done in an hour, awesomely moist and killer looking. I plan on frosting it with my own Chocolate Buttermilk Icing. GREAT Sunday cake to make with the kids as a special treat nevermind it uses basic pantry items and was simple to follow, which I appreciated. Smells AH-MAZING while baking.
