I added 1/4 cup of white wine (Chardonnay) when I added the lemon juice, I used 2 tbs of lemon juice instead of 1, a couple more cloves of fresh garlic, and I sauted red and yellow pepper, mushrooms, and red onions and added them in with the chicken.  I also added the pasta in with the chicken at the end so it could get all the great flavor!  My husband kept saying this tastes like restaurant quality and it really did!  It's really fresh tasting and you can taste every ingredient. It wasn't too greasy either.  It would be great to serve for company and it's super easy too!  Thanks for the great Italian recipe!",

I used chicken tenderloins instead of sliced breasts and coated them in flour before cooking them. A also added extra garlic, since I'm a garlic lover. When the chicken was almost done cooking I added red onion and red, yellow, and green bell pepper cut into strips. Serve over angel hair pasta and and top with grated Parmesan cheese and I don't think anyone could tell the difference between this and the restaurant original! The only thing I recommend is keeping the heat down to medium - the chicken will cook slower but the garlic won't get burned - burned garlic will utterly ruin the whole meal with its bitter taste.

I ended up serving it over angle hair pasta and it worked out perfectly for two... you may want to consider doubling the recipe if you're thinking about serving more people than I did.  Otherwise, I added about a half cup of white wine to the sauce while the chicken was cooking and cut up a tomato for some more color.  I cooked the chicken on low heat and would suggest doing so if any of you try this.  Too high and you'll sear it (trap the juices inside) and prevent it from flavoring the sauce... which it does beautifully!  Also, I parboiled some broccoli, sauteed it in garlic, and added it right before I served everything -- turned out so well!!!  Top it with parmasean cheese for the finishing touch :)",

Being very picky it was one of the few things they could get me to eat. I've ordered chicken scampi in rest. a number of times in hopes that it would be the dish I ate as a kid. No luck....until now!! I will make this again and again. Perhaps try adding a little white wine sometime maybe a little more lemon and a little less salt. But it's great as is. I actually like the large amount of butter and olive oil sauce it yeilds as it is great over pasta. Be sure to have some fresh Parmesan to grate over the top when serving. Goes great over angel hair and makes awesome leftovers.",

I don't recommend cooking the chicken for 10-15 minutes check it after 5. This dish was good enough to make for company. Thanks for sharing.

I read the reviews and used some of their suggestions: did not turn the heat up too high to avoid burning the garlic dredged the chicken in flour used half of the butter to start with and the remaining half throughout while cooking. I also used about 1/4 cup of white wine when putting in the lemon juice and used about 4 cloves of garlic. Once the chicken is cooked I added chopped yellow and red bell peppers (1/2 of each) mushrooms and fresh broccoli. After letting it cook for another minute or two I added my cooked angel hair pasta and tossed it all together in the pan. DELICIOUS! My two sons and husband ate it all up and barely even talked.
