I'm seventeen and I'm just trying to find recipes that will be good for my family when I get responsible enough to have one..=D..so I cooked my mom dinner saturday night and made these as dessert and they are FABULOUS right out of the oven when they are still a little warm yet. I went light on the oats because I added raisins to half of the batch-MISTAKE. The ones ROLLED IN the powdered sugar didn't even taste like oatmeal cookies when cooled but the ones i didn't roll in the confectioners' sugar tasted like oatmeal. MY ADVICE: add all the oats add raisins if you want don't use the confectioners' sugar. these are amazing and the best oatmeal cookies my mom said she'd ever had and oatmeal are her favorite. 3 These made me thirty (30) cookies I don't ever think the serving amount is correct. I pulled them out a bit earlier and still days later they are super moist. Delish. Will definately make again--THANKS.!",
