Great combination of flavor and textures - a must-try for pepperoni lovers. I still hold loyal  to the Bacon, Apple, and PB sandwich, but the boy says this one beats it. Of course, he is odd. We disregarded measurements and just let the toppings pile til they said 'when'.  Thanks for the recipe!",

I added 12 pepperoni slices to each sandwich. Purchased the pepperoni from Sam's Club, bought it in bulk, and it tastes so much better than the stuff you buy in the grocery stores. \"It's nice & spicy.\" Dani, I'm so glad your dad introduced you to this sandwich, and I'm delighted you posted the sandwich recipe to share with others, as this sandwich is definitely a keeper!!",
