It's a great base to tweak the seasonings to your family's liking but we liked it as written. For those who said it was too spicy I don't think the recipe intends you to use jalapenos as your main chile. We used anaheim chiles and roasted them ourselves. You can pick up canned green chiles in the supermarket to skip that step of you wish. The addition of some jalapeno for heat is fine but leave it at that:)..... This also tastes great with red chiles instead of green - I have made it with New Mexico Red Chiles and it is YUM YUM YUM. Very authentic and tasty. Thanks!",

I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin which went well with the other flavors. Overall it was a little bland. I used very mild green chiles.
