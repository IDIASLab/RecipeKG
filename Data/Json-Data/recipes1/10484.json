I cooked it in my slow cooker, which helped keep the roast moist and tender, and like another reviewer, I added a package of dry onion soup mix to it. I think it added some flavor, but the taste of the coffee was just too strong and overpowering.  I have a number of ways to cook a roast AND enjoy the gravy, so I would not make this recipe again.",
