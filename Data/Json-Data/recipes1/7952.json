Apparently these reviewers do not know what custard actually is. Real custard is not creamy. It is a firm, if not very firm, texture. They are thinking about Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which really is not a true custard dish, but a cream dish. I am going to give this recipe 4 stars because the crust did turn out a tiny bit wet. In the future, I might consider pre-baking the crust a tiny bit to firm it up. For anyone reading these reviews, and who does NOT have a firm grasp on the difference between Custard and Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and wants a cream-type pie, then I suggest you look elsewhere, because this is a Custard pie.",

I like that it's sweet but not too much so and it is a nice change of pace from a fruit type pie.
