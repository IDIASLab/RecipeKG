I ran out of all purp. flour and have had Jiffy brand baking mix I've been trying to use up so worked out well. Used 1 box vanilla and 1 box french vanilla pudding mixes. Used small cookie scoop and made 37 cookies instead of the stated 20. Placed a Hershey's Almond Kiss in the center of each one (figured the Kiss would fit in with Valentine's Day theme) These did remind me of blackeyed Susan's w/the yellow dough. The dough is very oily...but very easy dough to roll in balls; no sticking at all. Rolled up quickly. The most time-consuming part was unwrapping the kisses:) I did find on a darker non-stick sheet they only went for 7 minutes and they were darker on the bottom than I usually like; 10 min. on the Airbake; which usually take longer so watch the time...I think 10 min. is too much especially with the oil. They are not really sweet so make sure they are dolled up with something sweeter in the middle for the 'brown eye'. I wouldn't go out of my way to make again but quick and easy. If making 20 of these and only using 1 choc. chip for the center I think they would be very blah-tasting. They did taste pretty good w/the Hershey's kiss.",

I haven't tried other pudding flavors yet but I think chocolate and butterscotch (and maybe pistachio) would be good.",

Corrine is right you can use whatever flavor of pudding you like.I had one box of pistachio pudding and one box of vanilla instant pudding. This recipe is very forgiving. I can see it as one of the recipes my granddaughter would love to make. I made these cookies and added 1/4 cup brown sugar taking the advice of one of the reviews. I used a Tablespoon of dough and rolled them in rainbow sprinkles. I placed the cookies on parchment paper and flattened the cookie slightly (2 inch circle) and baked the cookies. Then I took the cookies out and pressed the Hershey's Kisses into the cookie. (I didn't have any chocolate chips. Thanks Corrine! UPDATE: Don't use diet pudding the cookies will dry up to fast.
