I removed from the refrigerator and rolled into a rectangle, sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon. INSTEAD OF PLACING THE PASTRY FLAT ON THE PEACH FILLING, I rolled the pastry into a log.  I took dental floss and placed it under the log, lifted both ends of the floss, crossed over and made my slices. I greased an 8\" x 8\" glass baking dish and poured about half of the peach filling in the bottom of the dish. I placed each pastry roll on top of the peach mixture, spooned the remainder of the peach mixture on top of the pastry rolls and baked until golden.  Delicious with vanilla ice cream!",
