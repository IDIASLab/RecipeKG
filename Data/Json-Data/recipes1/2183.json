I had to make it slightly differently honey in the middle and alot less coconut (hubby isn't keen so i added more oats to make it up) and it turned out fantastic. Like a flapjack but not as chewy and lovely and sweet. This would be lovely will all kinds of jam type middles I think! Matrimonial Bliss it sure is!",

Chocolate chips peach preserves berry jam and finally carrot cake jam. I found them to be dry tasteless and personally will not make these again. I couldn't even get my husband to TRY one.
