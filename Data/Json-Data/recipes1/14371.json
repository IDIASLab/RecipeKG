It calls for 1 C shredded sharp cheddar, 2 Tbls dry bread crumbs, 1/4 tsp dried and crushed tarragon leaves, 1 10oz pkg chopped spinach thawed and well drained, 1/2 lb fish fillets.  Combine cheese, crumbs and tarragon, reserve 1/4 C for topping.  Mix with spinach.  Spread this into baking dish, top with fish, sprinkle on remaining cheese mixture.  Bake 450 15 to 20 minutes.  Two servings.  I love all the variations.  I myself added an egg to make the spinach more like a souffle.\n\nOf course, I rate it 5 stars!\n\nEnjoy!",

However, I have made several key changes so that's why I'm rating this 4 stars -- Firstly, I set the oven at 400 degrees. Since I use frozen cod, I end up cooking these much longer as well. I place each cod into small au gratin dishes (sprayed with Pam) for individual servings; squeeze fresh lemon juice, sea salt & freshly ground pepper over each; top each with mixture of fresh baby spinach (cut up), 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 1 beaten egg, and crushed saltine crackers instead of  dry breadcrumbs; cover each dish with foil.  I found that roasted new potatoes go very well with this fish ~AND~ the best part is they can roast in a seperate pan right along with the fish! For that, I toss the potatoes in a pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil; little salt & pepper and throw the pan in the oven next to the fish. They're ready when nicely browned. Serve it up with steamed baby carrots--how healthy is that?!",

I don't care for frozen spinach so I used fresh which I steam-fried with chopped garlic and onion just until wilted.  I removed the excess moisture and proceeded with the recipe.  I substituted hard Parmesan reggiano cheese for the cheddar, which I grated.  It has less fat than the cheddar, is less greasy, and we love the flavor.  I topped the fish with a mix of Italian bread crumbs and finely grated Parmesan, which I then sprayed with a bit of butter flavored cooking spray so it would brown and crisp nicely.  It came out fabulous and my husband absolutely loved it.  I've made it several times now and it will definitely stay in my recipe rotation.  Thank you so much for such a delicious and healthy recipe.",

That said, this is a really great combination of flavors, and is quite unique. I didn't add anything to the recipe and made just as stated - it was just fine, what some might consider \"bland\" but I thought it enhanced the cod and cheddar flavors nicely. The spinach mix was quite good, but if you're trying to disguise the flavor for spinach-haters, more customization would be needed (extra cheese, extra egg, etc.). All in all this was a really nice and quick fish dinner - thanks for sharing :)",
