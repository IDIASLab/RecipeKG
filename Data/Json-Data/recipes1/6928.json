Tried it a second time, and this is what I suggest....\n\nUse the box of powdered pectin (1.75 ounce) and add the pectin with the juices. Bring to a boil, THEN add the sugar and bring to a second boil for about a minute.  This goes hand in hand with the pectin manufacturer's guidelines (who I called).",

Granted I only had a couple dozen fruit on the tree but never the less all were invested in this delicious jelly. I did as others had suggested and used the powdered pectin mixing it first with the juices bringing to a boil and then adding the sugar and again bringing it to a boil. As far as juicing the poms.... bottom line- wear gloves! The lovely purple color stains but the following day your hands will actually look a deadly green- quite impressive. I juiced with a citrus juicer but found that a lot of the fruit did not get squashed so what was left I put in the blender and pulsed it a bit and then put everything through a strainer. The fresh fruit juice is a bit more tart than the 100% juice found in our grocery store but once mixed with the lemon and the sugar really has a delightful taste. I am planning on including the jelly made in Christmas gift baskets- it was that good!",

What a wonderful addition to our holiday jelly making! Thank you Holly!",

I don't know if I followed the recipe correctly but my jelly didn't gel as much as I would have liked. I would use a little bit more \"gel\" or less juice the next time. The best way to juice these puppies is an old-fashioned lever style juicer-- the kind you use to juice orange/lemon/lime quarters. (I think they use them at Braum's Ice Cream to make limeades) Peel the pomegranate under water to avoid squirting yourself with the juice which stains like crazy. The seeds sink and the rind floats. Break off a quarter hunk and put it carefully in the juicer and squish.",
