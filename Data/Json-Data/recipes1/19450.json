I used olive oil instead of butter did not use an onion but used some onion powder also used powdered ginger instead of fresh. I used all the other spices as written and really liked the flavor of this rice. I also used about 1/2 cup of celery and 1/2 cup of raisins. Both of my toddlers liked this recipe too which is quite an accomplishment since they are really picky. I will make this again and next time use broth and fresh ginger. If you are out of those ingredients it still tastes fine without.",

When you add the spices you're just toasting to bring out the flavor the longer you cook after adding the spices the more flavor you lose. Next time we will also increase the amount of soy sauce and raisins-we love raisins. They add a nice touch of sweetness. Very tasty dish am looking forward to next time.",
