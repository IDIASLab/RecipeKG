They were easy to make and turned out fine but my husband and I thought they were quite flavorless. And we made them with a bit extra cocoa and some extra sugar. Even with that they were not chocolately at all not sweet (and my husband doesn't like things that are too sweet but he didn't like these) and pretty flavorless.. There's a faint date flavor with a faint chocolate flavor and the chewiness of the corn flakes was not really appealing to my husband. (They're not crunchy--there's just some bites with a chewiness to them.) They could use more cocoa more sugar some salt? They aren't even a healthy cookie because of all that shortening. Big disappointment for our particular taste buds.",
