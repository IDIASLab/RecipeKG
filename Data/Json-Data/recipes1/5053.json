I didn't see how the olives would be good mixed with tomatoes and wine, but it was exquisite!

Also used one can of diced tomatoes... drained it and added 2 fresh tomatoes quartered.\nDelicious.. As recommended, I served it over Saffron rice, what a great idea.. TOO GOOD!",

The second time I made this I doctored it up with loads more garlic lots of fresh basil and oregano and substituted heavy cream for the chicken broth. I also removed the chicken breasts after browning them made the sauce brought that to a simmer then re-added the chicken and simmered it for 20 minutes. It turned out much better for my tastebuds.",

All I had was a dozen chicken legs in the freezer so I thought I would give it a try. It was GREAT. We LOVE LOVE LOVE green olives and DD had a great time cutting the olives for this. I only had one Roma tomato and a few grape tomatoes so I used one can (10 oz?) of diced tomatoes didn't drain and also the fresh ones I had on hand. A LOT of green olives maybe 30-40 mostly cut in half and dried Italian seasoning (no bay leaf). Also I only used 2 large cloves of garlic next time will go for 4. I didn't have any white wine so I used about half of the tomato can full of chicken broth and a splash of Merlot. I covered and baked for around an hour and the chicken was falling off the bone. I served it over white rice and with English peas. It was a huge hit! Both my 5 & 2y/o ate 2 chicken legs each. Hubby took leftovers to work. This is a keeper for our family for sure!! Thanks for sharing!",

To the reviewers that found it dry or overcooked try flipping the chicken over halfway through and I even basted it every 10 minutes or so. As per other reviewers I was afraid the final product would be too salty so I didn't add any salt and it was perfect. I used all chicken stock as I don't care for wine in cooking and used cornstarch to thicken the sauce when it was done to pour on the top. It was great!",

I also used canned diced tomatoes (no fresh on hand) 1/2 black olives & 1/2 green olives (thought the appearance would be better) and no broth as the chicken breasts were frozen which gave off sufficient liquid with the wine. I did deglaze the pan with flour and wine but also had to add 3-4 T. concentrated dried tomato paste to help thicken it. Having only 4 chicken breast halves the sauce was sufficient to serve over pasta. This is a quick meal which will become one of my go-to recipes when I just can't think what to cook!",
