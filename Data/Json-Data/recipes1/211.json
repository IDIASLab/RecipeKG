However, after chilling the dough for several hours, I found that it was far too sticky to roll out, even with parchment paper or a bit of extra flour. So, like previous posters, I whipped out my pastry bag and piped out the dough directly onto the cookie sheet. It took a bit more work that way, but the result was a few batches of delicious cookies which tasted exactly like vanilla wafers should. Perfect afternoon snack for my kids and their friends, who could not stop munching them.",

The only other change to ingredients that I made was adding an extra half teaspoon or so of vanilla extract. After chilling, I simply rolled pieces of dough with my hands, as with any other cookie. I pinched off bits that were about a rounded teaspoon. After placing on the sheet, I slightly flattened each with my palm. I baked for about 10 minutes at 375 instead of 400. This assured they were slightly crunchy on the top without being overly browned. These are tasty little cookies. Worked great for banana pudding but I'd eat them as is!",

After curing for 6 months it was time to try it out. I chose this recipe because I could split the recipe and try both types of vanilla with the same recipe. The results were a great crisp little cookie. The dough was very soft so I did not chill for the 1-2 hours instead I put it in a decorator tube and squeezed it out on the cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. No matter what tip I tried the cookies had the same result. A nice little round cookie with a smooth top. I got 7 dozen cookies with this recipe. I froze a bag of them to try a banana pudding recipe with them. My family really liked this cookie and I know I will make them again.",
