For a different (and really yummy) flavor and texture try six-grain \"oat\"meal. We discovered this when it was the only thing in the house to use (CA grocery strike). Also was very good with raw sugar sprinkled over the top before baking--gives cookies a bit of a sparkle and a touch of sweetness.",

I mixed up the dough put it in the refrigerator went to gather eggs found the dough had expanded over the top of the bowl and pushed the refrigerator door open.
