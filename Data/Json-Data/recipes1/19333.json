I use to make my own Garam Masala but found it too time consuming to make from scratch, I tried this recipe because it used less ingredients than what I am used to cooking with.  Sorry but it was lacking in the rich flavour that I am use to.  \r\n\r\nI have also tried some other brands like McCormick's and was disappointed at the blend.  I just recently discovered the most amazing Garam Masala when I visited a Farmers Market in Port Moody area close to Vancouver BC.  It was amazing, it was a punjabi style garam masala that can be used for hundreds of recipes. It seriously reminded me of my mother-in-laws cooking back in punjab! You can get it online from IndiaBase Canada's website.  \r\n\r\nSharmila masala's is another brand that I truly love, but its a bit hard to find.  \r\n\r\nMaking Garam Masala is an art and often takes several tries before getting it right!\r\n\r\nHope this review helped!",
