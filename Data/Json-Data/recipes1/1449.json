I put the whole egg in with the butter/sugar mix and I used 2 cups of freshly sliced and sugared strawberries....juice and all....and folded them into the other mix. Bake time for an 8x8 pan in my convection oven was 40 minutes. It was our first taste of strawberry bread and it was an instant hit. Unbelievable moist and absolutely delicious.",

I did find the batter to be a little on the thick side so I added about 1/4 cup of milk. I also had some shredded coconut on hand so I threw that in for a little added flavor. I baked these in a Texas sized muffin tin and sprinkled the tops with some turbinado sugar for a little extra \"crunch\" before popping them in the oven. I baked them at 400 for about 23 minutes. Sweet and fruity!",
