I used red skinned poatoes and left the skins on and since to type of onion was specified I used green onion as it's mild in flavor and pairs well with baked potatoes. I used Hellman's light mayo cutting it with a bit of sour cream and like others I chose to used shredded cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta. I mixed in some of the bacon and left some to use on top. I left out the green olives and chose to use chopped fresh chives on top instead along with the rest of the bacon - YUM!",
