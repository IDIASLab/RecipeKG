Looks too pretty to slice into!\r\nI brushed 2 tablespoons of soft butter all over the top(s) as soon as the loaf(s) came out of the oven. Since the basics of kneading, rising and braiding are not included; I would suggest the novice baker do a little research on these three fundamental elements of baking bread, before tackling this recipe. I know the rest of us will include this delicious bread in our favorites file. Thanks so much for sharing.\r\nPeccavi\r\nP.S. Don't forget to lightly grease your\r\ncookie sheet before placing your braided dough on it for the last \"rise\".\r\nAnyone that's stumped trying to braid a four strand, see my Profile for my email address. I'll send step-by-step instructions.\r\n\r\n",
