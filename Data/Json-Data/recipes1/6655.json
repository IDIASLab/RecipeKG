I've never decorated a cake before so i think i didnt do justice to how it tasted.

I was glad to see it on all recipes with all the different frosting ideas.  I use a 7 minute frosting and fold in about 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and let sit just until they barely start to melt. Spread onto cake carefully as to not completely blend in the chocolate chips, then chill.  You have crunchy ribbons of chocolate mixed into the frosting.  It is wonderful!",

Those that are leavened with baking soda require natural (non-Dutch processed) cocoa so that the alkalinity of the baking soda can neutralize the acidic cocoa. Recipes leavened with baking powder require Dutch-process cocoa to maintain the neutral pH of both.\r\nI used parchment paper in the bottom of the cake pan and up the sides to lift out the cake (8x8pan). The rest I made as cupcakes. The cupcakes cooked more evenly in less time. \r\n",

I made it for my son's 8th bday with the chocolate icing found on the berry glazed chocolate cake recipe on this site.  Everyone at the party (the adults especially) asked for the recipe.  Most are not cake fans but even my dad said it was so good he finished the cake before his ice cream.  I will make this over and over again--in fact I am making cupcakes today.  MMMM!  ***I forgot to add that we don't drink coffee so I used Mexican Stephens Hot Cocoa instead and it gave it a nice flavor- I imagine you could use any flavored hot chocolate and it would add a nice flavor.  I also used 2 tsp of vanilla - I am sure you could use different flavoring too.  I love this recipe.  ADDITIONAL COMMENT: I have made this several times since my first time and was even asked to bring it to my sisters 30th birthday-her request.  It is the best cake recipe- I make bundt cakes and sprinkle powdered sugar and I make mini bundts and cupcakes- time is a little over half the time as a cake- 20-25 minutes.  they melt in your mouth.  This time I didn't have milk so I added powdered with the dry and water with 1 tbsp vinegar.  It was fabulous I won't make another.  UPDATE: ok so I have made this again for the umteenth time and it turns out great everytime. I have used Pero in place of coffee and the satiny chocolate glaze is amazing...",
