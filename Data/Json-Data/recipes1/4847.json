The salad needed a bit of some kind of dressing so I used creamy balsamic from the fridge.",

I cut the sugar in the marinade in half and used three slices of bacon for two salads. I also added tomatoes as I had some fresh from the garden. This was good and we both enjoyed it. The only change I would make next time would be to omit the water in the marinade. I think it may have kept my chicken from browning nicely. Other than that a good recipe!",
