I'm not sure if I'd use mushrooms again either since they got soggy quickly; maybe cutting them chunkier rather than in slices would help.",

I used Asagio cheese (picked up the wrong package...) and didn't notice a difference. I just used Romaine lettuce. Toasting the sesame seeds and almonds really makes a difference and is worth the extra effort (but I HATE toasting b/c I always burn!). Try this salad with Newman's basalmic. Ok but not great probably b/c of the sogginess but still won't likely make again. Thanks anyways.",
