I browned the sausages the night before and just took them out of the fridge a little ahead of time. Splurge on a good quality sausage it makes a difference and cut them up into bite size pieces. Was able to throw the pancake mixture together in 5 minutes. Like others said it's so nice not to be standing at the stove making more pancakes while everyone else is enjoying breakfast. Will definitely make this again.",

I didn't sift the dry ingredients together--just stirred. The pancake turned out extra fluffy (1-1/2\" tall) with wonderful flavor. The vanilla suggestion was a great one!
