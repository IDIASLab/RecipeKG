It takes a bit of time to cook the squash and scrap them since they are so small but oh is it worth the effort. I've modified the ratio so that it fits better with what I can find in the store. 4 squash to 4 cups broth to 2 cups(1 pint) cream. This gives a little more squash so the soup is a little thicker. I also add several health pinches of nutmeg which really tops it off well. Oh and since this recipe has so few ingredients buy high quality. I've found Pacific Foods Organic vegetable broth (1 Quart) is SO much better than bullion cubes. Thank you Sue!!!",

Could it be even better with roasted squash? We'll try it that way too. I also tried adding nutmeg -- one of the other reviewers mentioned that. A healthy pinch makes for a subtly stronger flavor for the soup. Yumm!",
