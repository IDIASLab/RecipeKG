I must admit, I was a little skeptical of the gingersnaps, but this ingredient made the recipe outstanding.  The meat came out very tender and the sauce was fantastic.  I'm going to forward this recipe on to my family and friends.  I recommend serving with potato pancakes w/ applesauce & sour cream and red cabbage.  Thank you so much!!",

It says \"2/3 cup crushed snaps but I think it should maybe read \"2/3 cup snaps crushed\". They really did overwhelm the sauce.
