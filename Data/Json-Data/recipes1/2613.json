The previous pastry chef (at my job) had ordered a case of snickers that I \"inherited\" once I took over. Not really knowing how to use them up I visited my favorite site - allrecipes.com! That is when I came upon this recipe for snickers pie. It is a wonderful dessert easy and one that will get you RAVE reviews. The only thing I did differently was put a layer of caramel on top of the cream cheese layer (after it was baked). I feel it adds to the \"snickers\" feeling of the dessert. Try this dessert!",

I have one recommendation though: Instead of placing the 4 candy bars on top of the pie before baking the last layer CHOP them into smaller pieces this way it melts easier. When you refridgerate the pie the melted candy bar chunks make for difficult cutting. If you chop the candy bars into smaller sections it will melt easier and distribute the Snickers taste throughout the entire pie. Enjoy!",

I made it for my hubs b-day and he loved it:) The only reason I rated it lower than 5 was that I had to drastically cut back on the sugar... added 1/4 cup to fudge and 1/4 cup to cream cheese. With those changes it was perfect. Just to make it more peanutty and this was just for my hub I subbed 1/4 cup of peanut butter chips for part of the chocolate chips in the fudge. Also made peanut butter/chocolate ganache for the top and doubled the amount listed to cover the full pie. PS - If you want to make your life easier take advantage of your microwave! Don't chop or cube the chocolate and butter. Pop it in a bowl and nuke it 30 secs and stir and pop it back for 15 secs at a time stirring until melted. For ganache microwave the cream until you see a few bubbles and then throw the chocolate in and stir til melted. So much easier! Not like someone's going to eat your pie and say...\"Oh I can taste the radiation!\" LOL:) Great recipe and thank you Dayna for helping make my husband happy for his birthday!",

I made the recipe exactly as written except I cheated in two ways: I used a premade graham cracker crust and instead of using a double boiler I used the microwave - - less dishes to wash. I will be making this again but instead might use a shortbread crust instead of graham cracker. Also the chocolate part of the recipe covered over 1/2 of the pie so I didn't have enough room to add all of the cream cheese part. Next time I won't use all of the chocolate batter or else get a deeper pie pan. I also liked the idea of using a springform pan whch might be better. Thanks for such a delicious recipe!",
