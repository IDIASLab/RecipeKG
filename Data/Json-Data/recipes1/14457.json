By doing that, I needed to double the amount of sugar I used because the sugar blend version is sweeter than regular sugar. So instead of 1/2 cup, I used 1. then from a tip on the splenda website, i added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract (totaling it to 2 teaspoons instead of 1). i lightly sprayed cooking oil on the top so they would brown (because splenda granular doesn't brown like regular sugar). i rolled the dough and let it sit in the fridge for 1 hour. after that i sliced the dough into 1/8 inch slices and baked then for about 10-15 minutes in 325 degrees. they came out pretty good!! a little dry though so maybe next time i'll add a WEEE bit of water.",
