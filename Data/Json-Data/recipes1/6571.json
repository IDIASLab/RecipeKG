I changed a few things: used cubed cooked chicken, added shredded cheddar and broccoli spears (once I substituted a can of green beans-worked just as well), used cream of broccoli. Biggest change: spoon cornbread batter over all ingredients in baking dish. Cook until cornbread is golden brown and cassreole is heated through (about 20-25 minutes). Cornbread does not become dry or crumbly. Yummy and a fun way to serve an entire meal in one dish. ",
