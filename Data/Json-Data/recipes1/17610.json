I used baby bok choy and olive oil instead of butter... mixed the basting ingredients in a bowl prepared the bok choy leaves added them to the bowl and massaged the oil throughout the leaves. I put the leaves directly on the grill. The ends of the leaves came out crunchy and a little burnt the stalks were warm and tender. There were some bitterness probably from the burnt pieces but not all of the burnt parts were bitter. It was good and I'll probably make it again. Thanks for sharing!",

I used 1 1/2tblspns of olive oil instead of 1/4c of butter (I wanted to keep the fat content way down) kept the spices the same except the season salt which I used half of and just 1/8tsp of fresh black pepper. Submitter has it down twice so I used the lesser. Thought 1tspn was extreme. Added red hot pepper flakes to mine. I enjoyed this! Might be better with baby bok choy since it may be more tender.
