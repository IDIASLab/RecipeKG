I have made 10 loaves of this. I have even added banana's to most batches. I found the way to get this bread to come out perfectly was to bake it in the oven at the required temp. but when the top starts to brown and split, shut the oven off and leave it sit in there for a good half-hour to finish. Otherwise, since the bread is so dense it will help with the bottom not over baking. THis is a excellent recipe if you have a bake sale as it makes two loaves.",

It is also great for bake sales! You can also substitute just about anything for the strawberries--this makes great banana bread, strawberry-banana bread, and perfect pumpkin bread.  I've also used apples.  Makes good muffins, too--just don't cook them as long. The recipe is fine the way it is but after years of making it I've found if you use a little less sugar and 1/4 cup less oil, it's perfect.",

I used only one cup of sugar and cut the oil to 1/2 cup. I also used 1/2 cup of strawberry flavored applesauce (the kind I send in my kids lunch boxes) I finely chopped 1/2 of the strawberries in the food processor and the rest were hand chopped in larger pieces. I cut the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons. One large loaf and 3 small ones were done in about 50 minutes. The finely chopped strawberries will bake into the bread while the large chunks will be visible. My bread had a nice cinnamon flavor with a little strawberry kick throughout. I think some of the reviewers who have been disappointed were looking for more of a strawberry cake like flavor. If you like quick breads like banana pumpkin etc you will probably like this recipe. Thanks for posting it!",

During strawberry season here I made more than a dozen mini loaves and everyone loved it. I got five mini loaves from one recipe which bake perfectly at 50 minutes. Instead of the entire amount of oil I subbed 3/4 c. applesauce which gave it a really good flavor and cut the fat. I also reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 cup and it didn't affect the yummy factor at all. I might try adding blueberries to the strawberries during blueberry season - LOVE IT!!!! Thank you Eleanor!",

It also does not state what type of pan to use. So I used one large and one small loaf pan and had to bake substantially longer than the 60 minutes baking time in the recipe. All in all I would never ever make this recipe again!! What a waste of fresh strawberries.",
