I followed the recipe step-by-step making only those adjustments I normally do for baking at our 8 000-foot elevation. Oh and I did use paper liners in the muffin pan rather than grease it. Everything went very well. The batter was very light and fluffy and there was just enough of it to fill the cups to the top. They puffed up slightly during baking but did not for a mushroom-type top. I don't think they really need the corn syrup on top but though it makes things a tad sticky it was good. I might try maple syrup instead sometime in the future.",

When I added the mixture to the flour mixture the batter was awfully thick. No problem I used a soup spoon and put the muffin mixture in the pan. Baked them for the suggested time and although they don't look like the writer's pic they tasted pretty darn good! I'll definitely make them again but will watch how long I heat the raisin mixture on the stove.",
