Both version turned out well. Best served right out of the steamer:) I will be making this again.",

It was very fluffy and not dense for me. Would go well with cream cheese icing. In my opinion most things go well with cream cheese.",

The flour mixture was too dense and I had to add a splash of milk. Even with that the cake ended up lumpy. However the flavour was really nice so I made it again but reduced the flour by 1/3 (used 1 cup instead of 1.5 cups). I also sifted the flour into the yolk mixture first and then folded the beaten egg whites into the batter. As a preference I also used less sugar (between 0.75 cup to 1 cup no more) in the yolk mixture. With these changes the cake was perfect--smooth spongy and very lightly sweet (if you like sweet stuff you can probably use the full amount of sugar--but I think 1 cup is plenty).
