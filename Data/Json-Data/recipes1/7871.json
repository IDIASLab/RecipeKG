First time I ever made it I mistakenly used miracle whip (ouch) you must use real mayo for this recipe, and if you do not like dill, cut it out completely. Either way this is a traditional recipe in my family. Note: to fill a round rye or round pumpernickle bread bowl, you deff need to double the recipe. I place the bread bowl center of large platter and surround with Dark pumpernickle and light rye broken bread chunks.",
