One thing I have found that works well is instead of buying french or itlian bread loaf I buy individual crusty hogies found in the bakery at the grocery store. It makes the sandwich more managable to eat especially for my kids. I also make this to take to parties and I use 2 long thin baguettes. When you slice them it is perfect bite size pieces.

As others suggested I added a packet brown gravy mix to the beef. I made this in advance to warm later so decided to scoop out the bread spread the loaf with garlic butter and toast it. I then loaded it up and refrigerated it until dinner time. I then put it in the oven at 300 to warm and then broiled the top until the cheese was bubbly. My 17 year old son at one of the halves all by himself while my hubby and I shared the other. A keeper for sure!",

What's stroganoff without the mushrooms? I thought all that sour cream sounded like a bit much(I'm not a huge fan of it) So I still used the 1 cup of sour cream but used 2 TBS of worcestershire instead of 2 tsps. I will be making this again. Thanks for the starter recipe which turned out to be a very tasty filling meal!",
