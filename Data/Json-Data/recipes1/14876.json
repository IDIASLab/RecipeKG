Avocados are loaded with MUFA's (mono-unsaturated fat -->the good kind) which actually helps your body get rid of the \"bad\" fat. So Gracias for sharing this recipe! ",

I then basically doubled the recipe (except I only needed 3 avocados and 3/4 red bell pepper and 4-5 green onions)  Cut the tortilla shells into eighths, place an avocado slice on the tortilla shell, top with a spoonful of the tuna mixture (I used a cookie scoop), and I placed a fresh cilantro leaf on top.    This made smaller portions for many hands at the party.  It was a huge hit!!",
