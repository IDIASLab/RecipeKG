I would say to them please actually read the recipe. It clearly states to mix the ingredients and slowly add water until the batter is thick. If you are dense enough to just dump everything in the bowl. including the water and not read the directions then you deserve thin batter. Also we are not talking about deep frying here. This recipe gives a nice simple coating of batter while letting the banana speak for itself. There is no reason to add a thousand calories to this recipe by making it with a thick coating of fried batter. I covered my finished product with cinnamon and honey and topped with reduced fat vanilla ice cream and fat free whip cream. This recipe is very simple and quick. It took me less than 10 minutes to produce the finished product. I left out the tapioca flour as I didn't have it any on hand. I also had coconut water and fresh coconut available so I used those ingredients instead of what was suggested in the recipe. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It has been saved and will be made many times over.",

As there is no egg or baking powder in this recipe the batter doesn't increase in size as it fries. If you're looking for a batter of any substantive size around the banana this is not the recipe for you. There is just the thinnest coating on the banana -- not at all like any of the fried banana desserts I've tried at Thai restaurants. After this I looked up other recipes online and some (with different ingredients) said to let the batter sit for an hour. Perhaps this batter would have been better if it had sat for an hour but I won't be trying it again. Two stars for the shredded coconut in the batter -- that's a deliciously innovative addition.",
