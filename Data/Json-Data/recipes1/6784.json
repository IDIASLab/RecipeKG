Be sure the milk is boiled and the heat is reduced so the eggs don't cook in the pan. Melt the white chocolate just prior to adding it so the it does not burn. In our experience baking it there was sufficient filling from the given recipe to make two 9 inch pies. Definitely allow the pie at least three hours to chill before eating it or else the filling will collapse since its consistency is still that of pudding. Allowing it to sit also enhances the banana taste instead of the pure sugary and chocolatey sweetness that prevailed in the beginning. Overall there were many nuances while making the pie (which we made with a graham cracker crust) but our efforts were well rewarded by a delectable pie.",
