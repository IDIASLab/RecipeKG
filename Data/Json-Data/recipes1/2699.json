You have to be patient for consistency to thicken and stir constantly but everything else goes quickly. I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the completed warm mixture (for fun)...it was very fudgey and just scrumptious...cooled nicely and did not run...which was my biggest fear. I would double the recipe if you want a real full pie shell...this mix only filled it half way...this would allow you a thicker meringue to. I also liked that most ingredients are on hand (no evaporated milk needed as most other recipes call for and real chocolate isn't needed). I must say I have stopped my search for a chocolate cream pie recipe. I topped the slices with drizzled chocolate and raspberry puree...my hubby said it was as good as Marie Callendars.

I add 2 TBLS of butter to the filling when it is still hot at the end. Makes it glossier. It is the perfect filling for Martha Stewart's pate brisee crust filling. My husband and my kids went crazy for it. Will definitely make again. To the critics who complain it was runny you need to up the heat and wait until it gets pretty thick. Don't let it overcook too much or it will get grainy.",
