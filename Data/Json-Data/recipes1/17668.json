I prefer this brand to others. Some instants are gluey so the brand of potatoes used will result in a different texture. I added dried chives to the egg/water mix because I didn't have fresh on hand. After they were flipped I topped with shredded sharp cheddar. NOTE: You have to let these sit for a few minutes to firm up. They look super runny at first so don't freak out. Will definately be making these again. I also made the cakes smaller. Like some of the other reviewers our favorite part of the cakes are the crispy edges. These were very good and super easy.:)",
