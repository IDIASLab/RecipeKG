I used whole wheat PASTRY flour instead of regular whole wheat which gives these cookies an excellent texture (very similar to regular snickerdoodles). I used 1/2 teaspoon more cinnamon, the same sugar/cinnamon ratio I usually use (2T/1t). They seem a bit sticky when you are rolling them into balls, this is OK, they will turn out fine :) I did NOT press them down with a glass and they spread out just right. Like all snickerdoodle cookies you have to take them out before they look set, which was after about ten minutes for this recipe. I would highly recomend these cookies to anyone! They do NOT taste like molasses/gingersnap type cookies like some have suggested. They do NOT have a strong whole wheat flavor. They DO taste like snickerdoodles. Very good snickerdoodles :)",

This was my first time making Snickerdoodles, so I had nothing to compare them to.  Out of the oven, these cookies are nice and soft.  I tried them again the day after and they are crisp around the edge and still nice and soft in the centre!\r\n\r\nAs for the whole wheat part, I definitely could taste that they were whole wheat but I enjoyed that aspect.  As one other reviewer mentioned, it gives it a bit more of an \"adult\" appeal but my cousin still loved these.\r\n\r\nMy aunt says these are similar to her Ginger Snap cookies, so I may try adding a bit of ginger powder next time to see how they turn out.\r\n\r\nGreat cookie!

And i'm not a snickerdoodle lover! i used splenda for baking in place of white sugar and splenda brown sugar (YUM) for the brown sugar. i used 1/3 c. wonderslim in place of the egg (you can get this at wild oats health food store-it is basically prunes/dates cooked down and put through a seive and it replaces eggs as well as fats in recipes. it is great stuff and no artificial junk or hydrogenated oils or cholesterol-and it doesn't alter the taste). i accidentally put the topping mix ingredients in the dough because it doesn't separate them on the ingred. list but i think that made it better. of course i had to make topping to go on the outside too. it is important to take these out when they are crackly on the outside and look wet on the inside. they finish outside the oven. my first batch was crunchy but still the best snickerdoodle ever-couldn't keep hubby and kids out of them!",

I did not have cream of tartar so I substituted the cream of tartar/baking soda combo with 1 tsp. baking powder - did an excellent job!  I also recommend chilling the dough for a few hours - it will be much easier to roll.  And definitely flatten the cookies.  I flattened most of mine and got cute, perfect rounds.  The last pan in the oven, I forgot to flatten.  The result was not-so-cute dome shaped cookies.  :\\ Hubby loved them, I loved them.  A KEEPER!",
