I also substituted half of the flour for whole wheat, and then added a pinch of sugar and some grated parmiggiano. These would work well as easy herb biscuits too.  I baked on a stone pan and they came out perfect - browned on the outside and moist inside.  Note: if you like heavy, traditional butter biscuits, this may not be for you - but I prefer the lighter (and healthier!) texture that these produced.",

I used 2 and 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour 1 tbsp of baking powder 1/4 tsp of salt 1/3 cup of vegetable oil and 1/2 of skim milk. (I did not have buttermilk. Although I could have made some. You can take one cup of milk add one tablespoon of white vinegar stir and let sit one to two minutes and this is homemade buttermilk. Check it out online. That is how I found the recipe.) I ended up with fifteen biscuits (I use a mason jar to cut them out that had a slightly smaller opening.) They were a LOT better. Light fluffy and taste just like I used shortening. My daughter was happier this time. Thanks for the recipe though.",
