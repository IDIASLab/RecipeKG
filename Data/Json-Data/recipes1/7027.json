The basic idea is this:  lower temp, more time, less browning, versus higher temp, less time, more browning.  This is why we broil quickly and braise slowly, and why there are lots of temperatures on our ovens.\r\n\r\nSo, in short, if you see this recipe, read the reviews, and decide you want it crispier -- boost the temp to 400 and shorten the cooking time by 5 or ten minutes.  Or, boost to 425, do for 20 minutes total, and turn halfway through.\r\n\r\nI just hate to see a great recipe get \"dinged\" because people don't read reviews or know how to make some simple changes to suit their tastes. ;)",

My husband loved it but I did make some adjustments to the recipe (some similar to previous posts):\n1)Marinated the chicken breasts in Newman's Own Italian salad dressing for 3 hours 2) Added parmesan cheese and garlic salt to the bread crumbs and 1 cup was plenty 3) Drizzled a little melted butter on chicken in hopes of browning but ended turning up the heat to 400 towards the end because it wasn't browned 4)Added a slice of muenster cheese on top of each breast the last 5 minutes. I served this with broccoli and herb noodles and it was a very filling and great meal!",

I marinate the chicken in the salad dressing for a couple of hours to get the most flavor. I also sometimes mix some melted butter into the breadcrumbs.

I made this 2 days in a row last week and plan on making it again tonight! The flavor combinations are endless. I used light Italian dressing the first night & the second night I used honey mustard. I added herbs & parmesan cheese to my seasoned breadcrumbs. Tonight I plan on using an oriental dressing. I cooked mine for 25 minutes at 350 degrees (turned once) and broiled the last couple of minutes to crisp up the top. Thank You!",
