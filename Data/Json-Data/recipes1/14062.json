Also, I place all the graham crackers as a bottom layer, then a layer of chocoloate, and finally the marshmellows.  I would suggest pressing down the bottom layer with parchment or wax paper.  That seemed to help the \"crumble factor\"!\n\nUpdate May 2010.  I now bake the layers in phases.  First the the graham cracker crust (which I added a little bit of brown sugar and half the white sugar).  Then I add a layer of chocolate chips, but I use the mini chips.  10 minutes in the oven.  When it comes out I spread the melted chocolate with a spatula.  Then I add the marshmellows and bake for 6-8 minutes.  Only until light brown.  After it cools, I put the whole pan in the freezer.  After it is frozen, let it sit for 10 minutes, cut when still slightly frozen.  Then I put the cut pieces back in a pan/container and back in the freezer they go.  When I want to serve them, I take out what I need.  Although my family has been known to eat them frozen.  They do NOT last. Enjoy!",

(they are still delish though) Once cooled they cut nicely in to squares. Still gooey, but hey, they're smores, right!? Anyway, followed the recipe exactly, ground the graham crackers not to finely. Next time I think I will do them finer, like a true graham cracker crust. As to there not being enough for the top, I suppose it's a matter of opinion. The amount I had left, made more of a crumble top, which I liked, it looked lovely. So, if you want a true crust top, use more crackers! Also, per other reviewers suggestions, I baked the bottom crust for 5 min. before adding choc. chips & marshmallows. Almost forgot, I also used 1/2 semi & 1/2 milk chocolate chips.  Great & easy recipe!",

I started with the graham cracker crust(about 10min), then sprinkled the choc. chips (about 6min) once they were melted i spread the chips with a spatula. then i sprinkled the mini marshmallows on top&put it back in the oven till they were slightly brown&lastly i sprinkled some remainder graham cracker crust&let bake for another 5 min. turned out really yummy!! :)",

I halfed recipe and made in 8X8 pan. The only change I made was to add about 1/4 cup more graham crackers as the butter sopped up the crumbs and it was more mushy, than crumbly. The crust really makes it, so the suggestions to make extra are right.  The extra made just enough to cover top.  Per a suggestion, I baked crust for five minutes before adding marshmallows and choc. chips.  We ate them both warm and cold, and they are equally good.  However, you won't be able to cut them when warm. ",
