So moist that it did crumble a bit when handled (oven temp/ingredients/baking time were right on). I may increase the flour / decrease the milk a little next time to firm it up just a bit more. I also substituted pre-crushed toffee bits (usually in the baking aisle by the chocolate chips) instead of crushing the bars and substituted chopped pecans for the peanuts. Personal preference. Pecans just seem to have a sweeter flavor to them and I think lend themselves well to a baked dessert recipe. I can't imagine this being bad with any kind of nut however. Except pine nuts;-). Mmmmm.......mmmmmmmm........toffee.",
