Here's a TIP to add lots of flavor:  invest in an injector, and mix your favorite seasonings (don't be stingy!) with a cup of melted butter - we like the creole seasonings like chili powder, cayenne, or emeril's essense.  You can even add about a 1/2 cup of beer to the mixture.  Or you can buy the pre-mixed injectable seasonings.  Inject the turkey with all of the butter mixture, sprinkle some of the seasonings on the outside, and put in a NON SCENTED trashbag in the refrigerator overnight - at least 8 hours.  Then fry in peanut oil.  The meat will not only be tender, but extra flavorful!  Your Thanksgiving guests will appreciate the wonderfully unique flavor of the meat!",

I injected a bottle of strained Bernstein's Italian dressing and rubbed the bird with a mixture of 3/4 Emeril's Rustic Rub and 1/4 powdered bay leaves.  Use two people and a broomstick to lower the turkey. Boy, was it good though!  My favorite turkey so far.  And the dressing flavor was subtler than you'd think. No soggy skin from where the turkey rests on the roasting pan, the bird was beautifully golden all over.  Also, we didn't miss gravy as much as I thought we would because the meat was so moist.  Not greasy at all if you have the oil very hot and pat the turkey with paper towels before and after frying.",

Before pouring the oil in, we put our raw turkey in the pot and cover it with water.  Then, we pull our turkey out and mark the side of the pot with a marker of some sort to know exactly how much oil needs to go in. That way, you don't waste EXPENSIVE peanut oil and you always know you have enough.  Try making Belgian Fries along with the turkey!!  Go to www.belgianfries.com for directions.  They require two cookings.  Once before you cook your turkey and then after your turkey is done a few more minutes back in the hot oil.  Crispy on the outside and oh, so fluffy on the inside!",

When I lived where the premade injection juice was not available as it is here in Louisiana I used 1 stick melted butter 1 bottle garlic juice 1 bottle onion juice and strained lite Italian Salad dressing and hot sauce to taste. Cajun seasoning rubbed outside is a must as well. If you have problems finding an injector visit the Vet. The needles used on horses work wonderfuly. Peanut oil is not neccasary unless you are frying more than one in succession. Our family like to deep fry pisolette (rolls) while the turkey is resting...another thing you won't worry about at the last minute taking up oven space.",

I've been doing it for years - so much that I've worn out 2 \"standard\" turkey frying pots and had a 1/4\" aluminum bottom welded on my big pot (82 quarts - big enough to do 4 birds at a time!) for added strength. My only suggestion is that when you go to inject your bird (this is not an option in my mind) make sure you have the biggest guage needle you can find. Many of the readily available turkey injectors will clog with a speck of pepper. If you can't find a big enough one just cut the tip off the one you have - make sure you cut it at an angle. Happy frying!",
