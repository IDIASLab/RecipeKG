I use one each, green and red or yellow bell pepper and a wedge of fresh parmesan cheese, grated for each batch.  I've tried it with a few salad dressings and the absolute best is Bernstein's Restaurant Style Italian.  I'm serious when I say that no other salad dressing makes it taste as good.  I've even tried the same brand but creamy italian and it just isn't the same.  The trick to eliminating the dryness is to save about an inch or two of the bottled dressing and put it in just before serving.  The pasta initially absorbs the dressing and it can get a little dry especially if made several hours in advance or the day before.  That last bit of dressing added at the end is the perfect solution to that problem. Just made it for a Mothers Day barbeque and picnic and didn't get to bring any home, again! which is why I hid a bowl of it in the back frig for later.",
