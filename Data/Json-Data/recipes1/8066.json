I followed a previous reviewer's suggestion to saute the green onions mushrooms and garlic first and then add the seafood so that the seafood wouldn't be overcooked. That worked well. I cut the recipe in half and I was very glad that I did as it made quite a bit. A little tip that I'll follow when I make this again: if you use angel hair pasta after you drain it stir in a very small amount of oil to prevent the pasta from becoming one big clump. By the time I finished with the seafood sauce I had a huge clump of pasta that was all glued together!",

Two cost-saving things I did were to use imitation crabmeat in place of lump crabmeat or clawmeat, and bay scallops instead of the larger sea scallops (Beth didn't specify which anyway).  Re the procedure, in my opinion, 13-15 min. total is too long to cook all this delicate seafood.  So I sauteed the green onions, garlic and mushrooms alone for 5 min., then added all the seafood & cooked just til the shrimp turned completely pink, then proceeded with Step 3.  I've made this twice now, both times halfing the recipe, which generously serves 6 people.  Thanks, Beth, for the great recipe!",

                "reviewBody": "This was FANTASTIC! And fast & easy to prepare. By far the best Allrecipes recipe we ever tried and I've been a fan for at least 4 yrs now. Used a lot of reviewers tips for this one so might not be fair to rate the recipe but since the recipe is based on the original (who doesn't tweak???) I guess it should count. Halving the recipe was enough for 2 plus generous leftovers for tomorrow. First I cut down butter by 1/2 (2 T). Subbed some wine with chicken stock (1/2c each) and the grn onion w/vidalia. Used 1 lb total seafood - shrimp and lobster (imitation) - that was PLENTY of meat - no need for 1.5 pounds! If you've never used it you can find fresh herbs in the produce department in tubes that last for a cpl months and it cuts down on prep time for washing and chopping! I used approx 1T each parsley and basil. Also can get minced garlic in jars in produce dept! I sauteed the veggies & warmed the sauce sauce first then added the seafood last so it doesn't overcook. Slightly thickened sauce w/Wondra another great kitchen must-have! in baking goods aisle b4 adding seafood & liquid. Served w/linguine. YUMMMM!!!! The lemon juice measurement remained same @ 3T for the halved recipe and is a MUST! Not too strong at all it enhances this light seafood dish! Will most definitely go into our regular rotation. Many thanks for the posting!",

I did make a few changes: I substituted 1.5 cups of wine for chicken broth (will probably do 1 cup each next time); used linguine instead of shells I also added in some freshly chopped basil which I think added to the flavor; finally I spiced up the seafood a bit with a sprinkle of Zatarain's crab boil. The lemon flavor was wonderful and not too overpowering. The dish was quick to make and didn't take a whole lot of effort. This one will be going into my recipe book.",
