Definitely missing something although it was easy to make after work. Also the directions are for mixing the cake in the baking pan. It would be better to mix the cake ingredients in a bowl then pour everything into a baking pan which has been sprayed with a vegetable oil spray as the cake stuck a bit on the bottom. Sorry but I won't be making this again.",

This gave the cake even more of a chocolate flavor. Also I added 2 heaping spoonful of peanut butter. This helped with the dryness everyone was talking about and gave the cake and added bust of flavor. then I made a peanut butter icing (recipe: 1 cup peanut butter mix with 4-6 Tbls. water melt two blocks of bakers chocolate mix into peanut butter add 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla). I then covered it with a chocolate glaze. Anyway this cake traveled well looked great and was a huge hit. I know I made a lot of alterations but that is what you do with a simple recipe.",
