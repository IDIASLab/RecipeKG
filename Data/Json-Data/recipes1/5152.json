I also used chicken strips instead of wings.  The chicken cooked perfectly on a shorter schedule:  10 min., turn, 10 min., then 5 min. on a broiler pan.  Also, I made another half-batch of marinade (with 1 tablespoon cider vinegar and 5 dashes hot sauce) and stirred in 1 tablespoon cornstarch mixed with 3 tablespoons water while it boiled.  I served the extra sauce for dipping, and the next day, threw the leftovers together into one container.  It microwaved up just as good as the oven version!  The next time I do this, I plan to make rice and serve the chicken and sauce over it!",

I was so sure of this recipe, I mean, it has almost identical ingredients to dozens of other recipes I've tried, however, upon looking back at the ingredients, I noticed it was missing one key ingredient other similar recipes had: vinegar.  I think that is why this was too sweet, it was missing vinegar and hence, a 4 star rating instead of a 5.  I think because this recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of honey, maybe 1/4-1/2 cup of vinegar should be right?  Anyhow, I added freshly grated ginger to the sauce to give it more of an asian flare.  The good thing about this sauce is that it did carmelized nicely on the wings.",
