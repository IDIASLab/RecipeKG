My helpful hints. #1 Empty the fruit cocktail into a strainer and drain for a couple of hours in the refrigerator. #2 Mix the fruit cocktail and cream cheese together first then slowly incorporate the pudding mix. #3 Line a 1qt glass-mixing bowl with saran wrap leaving a generous amount over the edges. Spoon in the mixture and fold the saran wrap edges over the top and pat the mix down firmly. #4 Refrigerate overnight. Just before serving unwrap the ball and invert onto a 10-inch pie plate. Serve with vanilla wafers around the ball filling the pie plate. This was a hit at my work potluck today!",

I didn't have enough time to wait for this to chill to form it into a ball but I did put it in a glass pie dish and sprinkle nuts on top. This was pretty and tasty too perfect for a hot summer evening! I served this with 'Nilla Wafers and Graham crackers and by the end of the evening half of it was already gone! Thanks for the super recipe!",
