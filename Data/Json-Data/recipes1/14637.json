This recipe is a general guide. Have fun, mix and match your favorite seafood. I would ask your fish monger what is fresh, and then decide what seafood to add. I've even added a whole octopus before. Serve with a nice white wine, turn on some music and have fun. Great outdoor meal.",

For our personal preference next time I will probably leave out the potatoes - with the corn and yummy seafood no one in my family even touched the potatoes. Also I will double the clams and mussels. I used seafood stock (all I had) and added a quarter of a lemon and a few cloves of garlic to the broth while cooking. I also cooked this a bit differently since I didn't want the seafood coming out tough or rubbery. I started with par-boiling my potatoes in salted water. Then I dumped out the water and added the corn to the potatoes and the broth and my additions of lemon and garlic. I cooked these for about 5 minutes. I added the clams in a single layer on top of the corn and potatoes and steamed for eight minutes. Pulled them out. Added the mussels in a single layer for 8 mintues. Pulled them out and added the shrimp for a few minutes until cooked through (maybe 5 minutes?). Then I put the clams and mussels back into the pot and served with crusty french bread and melted butter. The broth was fabulous and the seafood was just right (not tough and rubbery or shriveled). I will definitely make it again.",

I took a large stockpot put the red potatoes on bottom a layer of clams layer of mussels and then snow crab legs instead of the shrimp. We also put a banana leaf on top for steaming (can also use seaweed). We added the entire 48 oz of chicken stock and a bottle of beer instead of vermouth. After sealing tightly we followed the recipe's instructions for 45 minutes on Med-low (after bringing to a boil). We also included Old Bay Seasoning I was afraid the seafood would be overdone but it wasn't. Excellent- especially the snow crab! A nice surprise was how delicious and soft the red potatoes came out. The skin had a lovely taste and the insides were creamy. We're already planning our next one with a bigger pot and more seafood:).",

We filled up a huge pot with potatoes corn sausage shrimp clams mussels and lobster tails. We did layer seaweed in bottom of pot and in between some layers to avoid scorching. We used a mix of chicken broth and white wine as well as chopped garlic sea salt and old bay seasoning. We steamed it over our firepit for about 45-60 minutes. We put brown paper on a large table outside and poured the contents of the pot on the table. Everyone just gathered around the table and feasted on the food as they liked. It was so delicious and fun we decided it was going to be our 1st annual clam bake to be repeated every summer. We may change the order of placement of seafood because the shrimp and mussels did get a little over done. Also be careful how much liquid you use. You don't really want the seafood floating in it. We may change a few things next time but I would recommend trying this for a fun and different meal. Thanks for the post.",
