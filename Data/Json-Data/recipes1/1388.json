I sprinkle the walnuts then most of the sugar then most of the cinnamon. I DO measure the sugar--if I were doing it by eye I would never add enough! (I put only the remaining sugar and cinnamon on top). To smooth the first layer of cake on the bottom I make sure to wet my hands. For the second layer of cake I actually take hand-fuls of batter and flatten them in my wet hands before laying them out. It is quite easy to join these pieces together. Don't worry if you don't reach the edges of your baking dish--this cake expands tremendously while baking. I love it!",

I changed some things to make it work for me:  I added 1 tsp vanilla to the creamed mixture, and I increased the sour cream to 3/4 cup.  I also added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. ginger to the flour mixture.  When everything was mixed together, I added about 1 cup of frozen blueberries.  I spread this whole thing into a 9x13 greased pan.  Instead of having a layer of filling, I omitted that step and made a streusel like topping for the top:  Cut together 1/2 stick butter, 3/4 cup brown sugar and 2 tsp. cinnamon.  Add 1/3 cup quick oats and 1 cup chopped pecans.  Mix together well and sprinkle over the top of cake.  This baked for exactly 40 minutes and came out beautiful!  I thought it was pretty easy to make and I'm glad that I came across this recipe.  This is especially delicious with a cup of fresh, hot coffee!  Thanks for sharing your recipe:)",
