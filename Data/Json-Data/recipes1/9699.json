As a result I got a 'soupy' texture to it - i.e. too much sauce. It would have been good over rice or noodles the way that I prepared it. Also I added sauted mushrooms and a bit of onion and a couple of chopped (cooked) bacon slices to it and it really gave a great flavor and more meaty base. Finally I cooked it too long so the shrimp were rubbery. The next time I make it I will add the raw seafood to the sauce to cook briefly and then put it in a cassarole dish and then melt the cheese briefly under the broiler. Whew! I guess I changed things around quite a bit but the flavor was outstanding and my guests all really enjoyed it. I served it with asparagus and small round roasted parisienne potatoes. Thanks - I will definitely make it again.",

For the sauce I just sprayed with \"I can't believe it's not butter.\" It does take longer to bake than the directions because it is so thick...I cooked it for 30 minutes. My husband just loved it.

I topped the seafood with the spinach and cheese.  I made the sauce just as directed, drizzling ALL BUT 2 TBS of it over the top.  I PUT THE REMAINING TWO TBS OF SAUCE INTO A BOWL AND MIXED ABOUT 1 CUP OF PANKO BREAD CRUMBS IN IT AND CRUMBLED IT ON TOP OF THE SEAFOOD, CHEESE AND SPINACH.  \nAnother word of advice, pan fry the shrimp for just about 2 minutes per side in butter, the scallops about 3 minutes per side and the thin fish fillets about 4 minutes per side.  I also sprinkled \"Old Bay Seasoning\" on the seafood as it was frying in butter.  Cooking the seafood first  will help keep water from accumulating in the dish (soupy).  I baked it at 450  (convection oven) for about 8 minutes.  The crunchy topping really makes a difference.   IT IS A MUST THAT YOU USE ALL FRESH INGREDIENTS FOR SUCCESS!",
