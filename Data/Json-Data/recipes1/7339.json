This also works really nicely in the slow cooker once you've browned the meat. Just make sure you deglaze the pan with the liquid before transferring it to the crock pot.

He says this one is definitely deserving of 5! I didn't have any celery, so I skipped it. I browned the roast in bacon drippings as per one suggestion I read. Then I tossed it in the slow cooker, covered it with the onions and garlic, and dumped in my beer (Yuengling Lager) and mushroom soup. I did this just as I was leaving for work, and 6 hours later he enjoyed an awesome homemade meal while I was away. Thank you ChristyJ!",
