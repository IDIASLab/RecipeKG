Used splenda instead of sugar and left out the parsley - didn't have any fresh. All the other herbs were fresh from my garden. My husband put it on top of a bowl of romaine lettuce and raved about it. I loved the flavor of the spices and oils together. I will make this again and will try the eggplant baked or grilled as well.",
