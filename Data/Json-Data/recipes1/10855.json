I would recommend doubling the sauce and adding some red pepper flakes while in the blender. Also add lots of extra garlic! Other suggestion would be just to use another can of diced tomatoes (drained) instead of dicing roma tomatoes, and use frozen spinach. I also used half-and-half instead of heavy cream, which was fine.",

He loved it and wanted me to make it for him. So we found this recipe on here and since then I have made it probably about 30 times. It quickly become a well loved treat in our family. I do a couple of things different. 1: I use sugar in the sauce and I triple the batch. I add just enough to give a sweet taste. 2: I add extra cream and cheeses. 3: When it is all done cooking I sprinkle Mozzarella cheese all over it and let it cook about 5 minutes more. Just enough time for the cheese to melt. I serve it with Fettucine Alfredo and garlic cheese bread. I highly recommend this recipe. You will fall in love with it. I have made it so many times that I don't have to follow the recipe anymore. Thanks Mistie",

I have never stuffed cannelloni before - and apparently it just doesn't go well if you don't know what you are doing. I constantly had all the \"stuffing\" coming out the other end and after enough frustration I layed the cannelloni in the dish and dolloped the mixture on top - kinda like a lasagna if you will. So while I screwed that up ROYALLY - I did NOT screw up the flavor! It was awesome. I totally recommend the alfredo with this too. I will try again in the future to stuff these right but in the meantime think that I might rather just get shells and stuff those...",
