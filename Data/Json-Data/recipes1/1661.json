I often send cakes to work with him so I was specifically asked to make a 'chocolate macaroon cake.' The only problem I had with the cake was that it started to rise too fast and furiously and I almost lost it over the top of my pan. I turned the oven down to 325 (which is what I usually bake cakes at anyway) and it calmed down enough to stay put. For the glaze I melted prepared chocolate frosting and added coconut and almond flavoring.I garnished the cake with toasted coconut and chopped toasted almonds. The verdict: H reported back that the cake was \"awesome\" and \"better than the macaroon cake from Larry's Market Bakery.\" So thanks!",
