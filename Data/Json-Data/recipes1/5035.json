First, I didn't have any bacon so I fried some shaved, diced ham and that was just like bacon except a lot less fattening.  Also, I used a mix of frozen green beans and broccoli because I didn't have 20 ounces of either, and I also used rice.  I mixed about two cups of cooked rice with about half a cup of the cheddar soup and spread it in the bottom of the baking dish, covered it with the veggies (I think I used more than 20 ounces), then put the chicken and ham and soup over it.  I used two cans of the soup for it and am glad I did!  And I used a lot more than a pinch of cayenne pepper and sprinkled salt on everything.  For the bread crumbs, I just sprinkled a handful of Italian bread crumbs over top.  I didn't have any cheese.  I think I'll make all of these changes the next time (the bacon and cheese really weren't missed), except I'll mix some milk into the soup so it's not as translucent and isn't as thick.  I think I'll also skip the bread crumbs or sprinkle them on before I pour on the soup.  And finally, next time I won't cook it under the broiler because the bread crumbs got too dark in places after just a couple minutes.  Just bake it like a normal casserole :o)  With these changes, I think it will be a five!",

Supermarkets here don't carry cream of cheddar soup and Canned soup's too salty for us anyway so I made a white sauce and added some good New York State cheddar to it to create my cheese sauce. I added additional water to the sauce since other reviews here indicated the dish could be a little dry a little more cayenne as we like a bit more spice and some poultry seasoning to add even more flavor.
