The only difference is the time you should boil the butter, sugar, cocoa and milk.  I bring the cocoa mixture to a soft rolling boiling on medium high heat then I turn the heat down to medium and stir constantly for 2 minutes.  A nice twist is to add almond extract instead of vanilla.  For a glossy finish to the cookie only use real butter.  These are my husbands favorite cookies than I've made them probably a thousand times and they have always turned out.  I also use 5 T cocoa instead of the 3 or 4 the other recipes listed.",
