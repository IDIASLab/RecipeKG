I had to change it a little bit, because when I got my green onions out, they had gone bad, so I used part of a sweet Walla-Walla onion instead, and sauteed it in the bacon grease after taking the bacon out.  I also used white balsamic vinegar, which added a little more sweetness.  I used 2 extra bacon slices too, but took out some of the grease.  The dressing got really thick; not sure if it was supposed to or not, but it stuck to the potatoes this way which I thought was good.  Since I didn't have the green onions I used about a TBS. of dried chives for color.  I also used red unpeeled potatoes.  Had this with grilled sausages on wheat rolls and fresh corn on the cob.  Very good!",

This is really more of a side dish than a salad. The vinegar gives it a nice tangy flavor. We add white yellow or red onion rather than green. Just don't have green on hand usually. The onions and bacon give the salad a crispy texture. I much prefer this to American potato salad with the mayo.",
