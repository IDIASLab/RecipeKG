Made a few changes though:  sauteed some chopped yellow onion and a few chopped mushrooms in a bit of oil before adding 8 oz of microwaved & drained spinach.  Also threw in about 1/2 c chopped sun dried tomatoes.  Drained cottage cheese and mixed in with the spinach, then poured the whole thing into a greased pie plate.  I sprinkled with about 1/2 c grated asiago cheese and then poured 6 beaten eggs over the top. Baked for about 50 min at 375. The sun dried tomatoes and asiago really gave the dish a lovely flavor.",
