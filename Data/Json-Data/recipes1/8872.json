I also added onion chunks and about 2/3 of a bag of baby carrots around the chicken while it was cooking. The carrots and onions were amazing some of the best I've ever had but the chicken was just okay very moist but rather bland. It might be better using boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken. I'd like to try this sauce with a whole chicken in the slow cooker though. (Maybe it would absorb more of the flavor?) This sauce would also be great on pork. I will probably make this again.",
