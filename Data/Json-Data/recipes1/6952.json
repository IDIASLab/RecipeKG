I also added some garlic salt to cooked beef (potato layer definately needs to be salted on its own) and shredded cheddar on top after it was done--just put back in oven long enough to melt cheese.",

Once I did that it was a FANTASTIC recipe for a quick dinner that holds well in the refrigerator. It came out as a cross between chili and stew that my husband fell in love with. I made these additions/changes... I pre-cooked the ground beef with additional onion and seasonings. I cubed the potatoes coarse-chopped the onion (using a large one) added 1/2 t. Penzeys bay leaf seasoning 1 t. Morton's Natures Season one rounded tablespoon of jarred minced garlic in liquid (the type from the produce dept.) and 2 8-ounce cans of tomato sauce. I also mixed everything instead of layering so the flavors would blend. I used a 3-quart casserole and baked it covered for 75 minutes. I then uncovered it topped it with 4 oz. of shredded cheese and baked for an additional 10-15 minutes.",

You can put whatever seasoningss you prefer, pepper, Lawry's garlic salt. It is cheap, tasty, and easty to make! I layer this recipe then I stir it up once I get it in the pan.

I did around 22 oz. of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp total and that was fine. I browned the meat first because I did not want all that grease in my meal and I spiced the meat with white pepper oregano and thyme while browning. I cooked it covered for one hour and only 20 minutes uncovered because I was using red potatoes and they cook faster. Overall this was a lot better than I thought it was going to be and even though it takes awhile to cook it was pretty easy.",
