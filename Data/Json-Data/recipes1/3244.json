Wonderful comfort food delicious with the beef burgundy gravy. I didn't have swiss cheese so I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup cheddar and 1/2 cup shaved parmesan cheese.....yummie! A new family favorite. If you plan to make this remember it is a side dish very much like mashed potatoes. It's supposed to be bland so that it compliments your meal gravy etc.",
