I followed the advice of other reviews and added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and found that it was WAY too overpowering..considering there is already a decent amount in the topping.  It just took away from the blueberry flavor completely.  I feel that if I would have just followed the recipe EXACTLY...it would have came out PERFECT, a 5 star!!  I will definately give this recipe another go without the adds...and will re-rate it.",

It is truly delicious and the sauce is the perfect \"topping.\"  None of the guests wanted either whipped cream or ice cream, both of which were offered.  So it comes higly recommended, but don't make the mistake of waiting until the last minute to prepare it.  I made no adaptations to it other than to add a little more of each of the spices for the sauce.",
