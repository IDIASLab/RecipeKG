Just a note of caution--be sure to blend the baking soda into the flour before mixing all the ingredients. If the baking soda is not blended evenly there will be bitter spots in the cake. My cake was done perfectly in 35 minutes. A total of 45 minutes baking time seems a bit long and this may be the reason some of the other reviewers found the cake to be dry. One final note--I added a few chocolate chips along with the nuts and this added a lot of interest and flavor to the cake.",

I combined all the wet ingredients (I used 1/3 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup oil and also added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract) thoroughly and then added to the dry ingredients / nuts in the pan. I thought I had stirred it pretty well but there were still a few spots of dry flour. Next time I will dump it all in a bowl and stir it up with a spoon there before putting it in the pan. I will also increase the almond extract to 1 teaspoon and add some cinnamon. I did like the recipe because it was one of the few dump cakes that did not call for a cake mix (which I rarely keep on hand).",
