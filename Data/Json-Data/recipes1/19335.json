I think perhaps those with non rising biscuits might have used all purpose flour by mistake, or had errors in technique. \n\nI use whatever solid fat I have available. My favorite is butter followed by lard and then Crisco. \n\nWork the dough as little as possible if you want light, flaky soft biscuits.\n\nI like to put a little fat in the baking pan for a crisper bottom crust, but keep your eyes on them because they'll burn more easily. And I brush a little melted butter on the top prior to baking.",

I roll the dough out to about one inch cut them out with my biscuit cutter and then I use a pie plate to cook them on. I also use just a tiny bit more shortening than is called for in the recipe. A little more shortening seems to not make them as crumbly. My husband loves them and so does my Dad. I cut this same recipe from the flour bag and laminated it to protect it.
