However, I did change a few things: Instead of 4 cups of milk I replaced with 2 cups of whipping cream and 2 cups of half-n-half. I also added salt and cinnamon to taste and since I'm not a huge fan of butterscotch I did half butterscotch chips and half white chocoloate chips. Nestle works great. And instead of regular loaf bread, I bought French baguette style bread. I also baked mine for way over the recommended 45 minutes..more like 1 hour and 30 miuntes. I don't like soupy bread pudding in the middle so I cooked mine until it was more solid. Let me tell you this bread pudding was so crispy, buttery and delicious that it was hard to share. I ate some for breakfast lunch and dinner!!",

I used cinnamon bread and added golden raisens (soaked in whiskey beforehand).  Oh, and also I did use just 1 cup of sugar (instead of 2 cups).  I didn't think it needed so much sweetness, and that was the right choice for me.  The final product I was got was out of this world!  Thanks!",

I have made this 4 times in the last four weeks for different groups of company each time, and if I owned the rights to this recipe I could get rich.  A couple of changes: I use a great brand of butterscotch chips called Guittard, a \"buttery\" butterscotch, the other was waxy by comparison. I also use only about 3/4 cup of chips, and push them down under the surface of the pudding before baking, they melt better into the pudding. For the bread I use half a loaf of the Sara Lee Cinnamon Bread and about 6 large fresh potatoe rolls, and use my Kitchen Aid so everything is well smoomshed. Using real butter to coat the dish seems to add something, instead of just spraying it with Pam. The sauce I use is the Whisky Sauce found on this site, but I substitute the Whisky with Brandy.  This recipe is Splendiferious!",

Instead of butterscotch chips, I used 1/2 cup of butterbrickle chips. I also put in some dried cranberry crasins and coconut. I also sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar before baking.  This is such a nice basic recipe and you can change this by adding your favorite things. I made the buttermilk sauce on this site also to go with it which is a very nice sauce and not as sweet like a caramel sauce.  This makes a large pan so we had a couple pieces and then I cut up servings and drizzled with buttermilk sauce and put them in the freezer. They heat up well and is a great breakfast item or dessert.  Now to keep out of the freezer.",

Its also a good base recipe for future customization. I made sure the bread was good and stale (meaning dry) so it would soak up all that creamy goodness! Bewarned it will rise when baking and fall as it cools so be prepared for a little overflow. I baked it in ramekins sitting on a sheet pan so cleanup was easy (who wants to clean the bottom of the oven!).",
