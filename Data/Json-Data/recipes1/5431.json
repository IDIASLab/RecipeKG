I used homestyle butter cake mix with a stick of butter- mix until CRUMBLY and pat it into the pan and bake for 10 min. 2. Unlike stated in the recipe the cream cheese mixture will not pour on top of the cake mix because it is too sticky- so I just dollop it all over the top of the hot cake layer and let it set for a minute and lightly spread it all over the cake- the heat makes the cream cheese easier to work with. 3.Bake for 35 min or when you see the cream cheese layer rise around the EDGE of the pan and brown. It will not rise to the top as stated in the recipe. 4. I used canned lemon filling with this instead of cherries- it makes great lemon bars! I haven't had any problems with sticking- I use the Bakers Secret 13 X 9\" Cake pan if that helps. Try it again with my hints and you won't be disappointed.",

If the mix is not crumbly then you have over-stirred the mixture. Follow the recipe (USE SOFTENED BUTTER AND CREAM CHEESE - DO NOT MELT THE BUTTER!) as directed and you will get pats on the back as I did!! VERY VERY RICH Tasting! Also remember to put the cream cheese down first or the cherries will make the bottom crust/cake very soggy and awful!",

I noticed after 10 minutes of baking the edges were starting to get really brown so I covered the whole dish with foil and baked for 30 more minutes. It was gooey and wonderful everyone loved it. I'll definately be making this again. If you're expecting a solid bar this isn't the recipe that you want. Also it's super rich so serving it with vanilla ice cream helps cut the sweetness.",
