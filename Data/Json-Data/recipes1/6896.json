If I hadn't added anything it would've been extrememly bland. So here's what I did: I replaced the water with chicken broth added another can of clams added about 2.5 fl oz of Worchestire sauce ( I love the zest it gave it) some Old bay seasoning (About 2 tsp.) added celery and 3 cloves of freshly minced garlic. It was to die for and I didn't even have leftovers! You may want to add more or less seasoning and worchestire sauce over the cooking period. I let it cook for about 45 mins and didn't have to mash the vegetables.",
