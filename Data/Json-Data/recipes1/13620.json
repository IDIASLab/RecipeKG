But here's what to do different next time to avoid some major problems: Use fattier ground meat (using dry rice in the meat sucks up any moisture and drys out the meat.) Microwave your cabbage a little to soften it and give it some water content (recipe calls for using raw cabbage which really doesn't get the right amount of steaming when cooking and the cabbage comes out rubbery and chewy). Also remove the thick veins on each cabbage leaf as they take longer to cook. Also add some ketchup for a sweet and sour taste, plus I add more sugar since I like my cabbage rolls sweeter.",
