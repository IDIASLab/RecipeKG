I recommend leaving the cake to slightly cool in the pan, then pricking it with a fork and pouring the glaze over it while still in the pan.  You will have to be patient as the glaze slowly absorbs into the cake but it will make for the most delectable treat when it is all done.  Let it cool completely after the glaze has been poured over, run a butter knife around the edges and invert onto a doily covered plate.  Sprinkle generously with powdered sugar and the savor the moistest, incredibly buttery sweet, scrumptious rum cake on the planet!",

I use butterscotch pudding yellow cake (although the funfetti is neat too) and a cup of Captain Morgan (instead of 1/2 c water and 1/2 c rum). Instead of a glaze grab a jar of caramel-butterscotch ice cream topping (room temp) and pours a bit on the top of the batter in the pan. Then take a knife and drag it around the pan to make a tasty caramel swirl in the cake!",
