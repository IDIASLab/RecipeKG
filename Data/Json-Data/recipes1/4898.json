Remove chicken from pan and set aside.  Saute 1/2 chopped onion and sliced fresh mushrooms in chicken pan until tender.  Add the remaining ingredients, I omitted the lemon juice and used a spicy honey mustard.  Let the sauce simmer for a couple of minutes and serve over the chicken.  This way the chicken doesn't get mushy.  It is very good....I will add capers next time.",

I did change a few things however, like using chicken stock instead of wine, omitting the savory, and just using a mix of mustard and honey to make the honey mustard.  I loved it.  The only complaint I had from my bf was that it was too lemony, so next time I might leave that out, and I may also use mustard powder instead of already made up mustard.  Thanks for the great recipe, I'll enjoy experimenting with it to suit my bf's taste.",
