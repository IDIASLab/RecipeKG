Shouldn't there have been some chocolate chips or baker's chocolate somewhere in the recipe? And also, I baked it for the suggested 45 minutes and the top started to burn but the center was STILL liquidy. You were right Zita, a waste of ingredients. I'll only make this again if it's revamped with more chocolate added. Sorry :(",

Here is what I did: I added 2 Tablespoons of cocoa used evaporated skim milk added a cup of coconut and only had sliced almonds for the nuts. After it baked 45 minutes I checked it and it was real runny that's when I realized that I had forgotten to add the cornstarch. So I baked it around 15 more minutes and let it rest for 30 minutes before slicing. It was perfect! - with a nice smooth creamy pudding-like texture. The nuts worked and the evaporated skim milk was fine. Hubby loved it with a glass of milk. So I recommend everyone to try this recipe.",
