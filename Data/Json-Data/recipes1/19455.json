We all LOVED it....yes, even I could not stop eating it.  I am so surprised there are not more reviews.  The effort is well worth the rich flavor.

Normally the pan of gravy just sits on the stove top until we're ready to eat but every time my husband walked by he dipped a piece of bread or piece of turkey into it while raving about it being the BEST gravy he's ever tasted. I don't have a fat separator so I filled my measuring cup with the turkey drippings and stuck it in the freezer so the fat solidified on top. This will definitely be my go-to Thanksgiving gravy from now on!",
