They are soft and slightly crunchy at the same time.  I served them with a honey-mustard sauce for dipping.  They must be served immediately because I found they cool off quickly and get harder as they cool.  I found that they reheat very well in the microwave for next day treats.",

I will try again though using butter instead of oil and the same spices. If that doesn't work I am going to have to scratch this one--but it sounded good didn't it?",
