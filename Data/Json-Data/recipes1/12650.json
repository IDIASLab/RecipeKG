I used strawberries rather than blueberries, plus a dash of lemon zest.  I was worried about the strawberries making it too runny, so I mixed the berries, zest and sugar, then let it sit in a bowl for 30 min. I drained off the excess fluid, spread it onto the crust, then made my husband roll it up for me. I read the reviews saying it was hard to roll so I wasn't taking any chances. It rolled up very nicely. Mine baked for about 40 min, and I served it with vanilla ice cream. Yum! Will definitely be making this oozing splat of goodness again.",
