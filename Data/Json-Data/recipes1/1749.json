I omit the walnuts and the frosting and add mini chocolate chips. Also, I only use the amount of oil that is called for on the back of the cake mix box. One cup of oil would have been way too much.

My co-workers raved and raved over this. The frosting is delicious! I used store brand mix instead of dream whip and it came out just as nice. It is soo incredibly fluffy and great tasting. It looks so pretty too with the cherries on top. I wouldn't change a thing....this is a great recipe. Give it a try! Sooo wonderfully moist too.",
