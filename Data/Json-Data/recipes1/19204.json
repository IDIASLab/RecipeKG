Don't be afraid of the miracle whip in it. It compliments all the other ingredients to come together to make one tasty casserole! Just because a certain ingredient in it doesn't sound good don't be afraid to try it. I was a little worried about the salad dressing too when I made it but just went with it and was glad I did! I wouldn't recommend substituting it with yogurt or sour cream. The zing of the salad dressing is what makes this dish delicious! Try it as it was written chances are you will love it!!",
