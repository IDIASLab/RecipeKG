I used around a pound of confectioners' sugar (I didn't measure but used around \u00bd a 2-pound bag), \u00bd cup peanut butter, 6 TBS cocoa, 6 TBS milk, and 1 TBS vanilla. I melted the PB, sugar, and cocoa together in the microwave for 90 seconds, mixed in the milk and vanilla, and cooked another 30 seconds. I then beat it with a wooden spoon for a minute. Instead of an 8x8\" pan, I used a 3.5\"x5\" mini loaf pan. It was ready to eat after around 45 minutes in the freezer!

This was worth every star for ease and for the tinkering of others. will make again next time i need a fast fix.",

In another review someone mentioned microwaving it and I agree that it helps make it creamier. The one difference I would do is leave the peanut butter at 1/2 cup if you want the stronger peanut butter taste and either omit the butter they suggest or add maybe 1/3 of a cup. In the future I might add a whole cup to increase the peanut butter flavor.",
