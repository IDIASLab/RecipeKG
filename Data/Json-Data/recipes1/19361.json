Two recommendations: 1) make sure to purchase low sodium tomatoe juice 2) put only 1/2 tsp garlic salt in at first then add more as desired. I did this in response to a reviewer not wanting the garlic salt at all. I also put in about 1 tsp onion powder and it was great. Very delicious! I agree with the chef vodka is optional with all these flavors:)",
