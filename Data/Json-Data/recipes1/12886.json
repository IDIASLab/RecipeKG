The only things I changed were adding fresh parmesean cheese and I drizzled honey over the pecans before baking.  Also, the 1/4 cup of poppy sead dressing seemed to be too much and made the spinach leafs a little soggy, so I had to add a cup more spinach.  So you might want to add dressing to taste instead of pouring the whole 1/4 cup in like I did.",

The first night we ate so much of it we were too full for the rest of our dinner, so the next time I made it I grilled some chicken to serve on top and that was our dinner - very yummy!  I used Paula's Poppyseed Dressing recipe from this website and it was fantastic.  We avoid sugar so I substituted Splenda in the dressing recipe and we all loved it!  One time I was out of pecans so I used walnuts and it was just great - the important part is the toasting.  Thanks so much for this new staple in our house. Edited to add that I have now tried it with grilled steak on it as well.  We will use this every way we can think of.",
