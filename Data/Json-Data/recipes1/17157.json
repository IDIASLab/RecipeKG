I also prefer my veggies in bigger rustic chunks so I obviously had to increase the cook time accordingly. One little tip I have is to add a slug of maple syrup when there's 10-15 mins left... adds a lovely woodsy caramelised layer of flavor and enhances the sweetness of the roasted veg. Yum! (FYI - I don't use the sweet chilli sauce).",

I did find them a bit too spicy for my palate and I think it was the extra pepper that did it--the submitter is right Montreal Steak Seasoning packs a punch and it has pepper in it already. I'd leave out the additionl pepper next time. I don't think I've ever had parsnips or rutabagas and I have no idea if I like them--didn't find them in the store so I just left them out and put in a red pepper instead. I also used baby carrots--tossed them in as is although I really shouldve cut them in half at least since they took the longest to cook. These veggies are good; just modify the seasonings to taste.
