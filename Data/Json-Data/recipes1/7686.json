To those of you who advised doing the sugar as 1/2 white and 1/2 brown, thanks!  The advise was well taken.  Like many here, I also doubled the recipe and added a cup of raisins to the apple mixture (I like raisins!).  The addition made for a very flavorful touch.  Thanks for the recipe, Barbara!

I tried to about double everything - put the apples in the orange juice as I was slicing them so they wouldn't brown.  Either I used too much orange juice (I only used a little over 1/3 cup) or having the apples in it caused them to release water while cooking because when I pulled this out of the oven it was SWIMMING in buttery water.  I kid you not - rocking the pan from side to side make it look like the apples were floating on top of water.  The topping had all melted and pretty much disintegrated in the water and it was just . . . ugly.  And REALLY REALLY sweet.  I even drained the watery part and just gave husband the apples and ice cream and he only ate about three bites.\n\nI'll probably try a different recipe next time since I couldn't make this one work.
