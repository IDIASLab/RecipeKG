It do think they could be just a tad bit more sweet though. I may use 3/4 c powdered sugar next time. Real butter makes these fall apart soft...like I like them. You can also use one t vanilla and one t almond or lemon extract for a little more variety in taste. My kids liked it w/ the almond extract and a little lemon rind mixed in. Enjoy!",

It's always a challenge to have something affordable for so many people for Christmas! This year all will be receiving a few of these Sand Tarts the recipe and their 'history' in our family. CHANGES I MADE: pecans instead of walnuts (we had a big old pecan tree in the backyard of my childhood home); no chilling; balls a tiny bit larger then rolled into small logs and curved into crescent shape; no steaming in brown bag.
