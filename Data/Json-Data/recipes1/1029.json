So after the first batch came out iI added about 1/4 a cup to 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the mix and i also rolled them in sugar. These still came out flat but that will happen with any flourless recipe. The second batch tasted much better I think. Also to avoid over browning on the bottom use parchment paper it works wonderfully in all my baking.",
