I seasoned the inside of the breasts before adding both ham and the cheese. Once rolled, I dredged in seasoned flour and browned in evoo and butter. I enjoy a sauce with my Saltimbocca, so I removed the chicken to a casserole dish, added flour to the pan to make a roux then added chicken broth, white wine and seasonings. I felt the chicken needed to tenderize and cook a bit more so I poured the sauce over the chicken and baked in the oven for about twenty minutes. Definitely a good start to what turned out to be a fabulous dish. Thanks.",

Also, after frying/browning the breasts I noticed my largest breast still wasn't done, so after I poured in the wine I covered it to steam a few minutes to help it finish cooking. I then removed the lid so the wine could evaporate.  Anyway, the flavor was really amazing--very bold and fresh, and the garlic taste wasn't overwhelming at all (but then again, I'm a garlic lover).  If you're like me and not keen on bland food, definately spice this recipe up a bit by seasoning the chicken before you cook it; especially since provolone is a very mild cheese, and once it's melted you can hardly taste it.  I will for sure make this again.",

Roll from outside in - chicken cheese (I like havarti or horseradish cheddar instead) prosciutto herbs (sage or basil) - and secure the whole thing w/ a small bamboo skewer. If prosciutto is on the outside it dries out too much and the flavor gets lost so all you can taste is salt. Sprinkle each roll with olive oil salt and pepper and brown the chicken a bit before putting it in the oven to bake. It's the most amazing thing ever even the leftovers taste good.",

I cannot remember whether I poured the wine in the pan or not (may have drunk it instead) anyhow it didn't matter because it was delicious. I went ahead and flipped the chicken over onto the proscuitto side and let it cook. Didn't flatten the chicken breasts though next time I will. Let some olive oil heat up then added a reduced amount of butter then the chicken breasts topped with a little ground sage. Finally I used shredded mozzerella instead of provolone. I am looking forward to the leftovers today. I think they will be yummy as chicken sandwiches with a little dijon mustard.",

I did rub them with a little sage before putting the ham on as others have suggested and used much less butter than 1/3 cup. 1 cup of wine turned out to be too much though probably because the pounded breasts cooked faster. I ended up pouring out some of the liquid before adding the cheese. Next time I will try using 1/2 the wine and add more if needed.",
