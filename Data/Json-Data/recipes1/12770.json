They were pretty good, but seemed to be missing a little something - maybe sauteed onions and green peppers would be good. I used the \"mexican mix\" cheese (all I had) and that gave it a little kick.  Also, the sausage gravy my mom makes is a lot tastier than this one. Hubby liked it okay. Alright for basic recipe. Will probably make again, but will tweak a little bit to suit our tastes.",
