She was German though I don't know whether the recipe was or not since she got a lot of recipes from friends over the years. Instead of rolling out and cutting the dough I rolled the dough into 3 dozen balls (not quite 1 inch diameter) and flattened them with my palm. If you want the cookies crispy the whole way through (and you do!) bake them on a baking stone until the edges are lightly browned and leave them sit on the stone for a minute or two after you remove them from the oven. These cookies made my day!",
