The dressing was light refreshing and didn't overpower the ingredients. I topped it off with a bit of cracked black pepper - YUM!",

I also added some cucumber and avocado slices. I didn't expect to like the dressing but gave it a try-- my husband and I BOTH loved it! For a really nice presentation lay the spinach on plates put the tomatoes on top and arrange each topping (eggs mushrooms avocado cucumber slices etc) in its own pile around the edge of each plate. Sprinkle onions on top. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you Uleta!",
