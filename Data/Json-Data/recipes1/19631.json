Using fresh tomatoes really gives a flavor boost, but I suggest chopping them and letting them drain, while the other ingredients are being prepared.  I added all ingredients EXCEPT tomatoes to the food processor and placed those in a serving bowl.  I processed the drained tomatoes separately, then stirred all the ingredients, together.  This also gave a chunky salsa, which we prefer.  Thanks for the idea!",
