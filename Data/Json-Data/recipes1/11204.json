I've made them by Anita's original recipe, and I've also made the following changes:  I've added shredded swiss cheese and chopped onions and red and yellow peppers as well as green.  I've added a chopped, seeded jalapeno pepper to the mix.  I've substituted cubed cooked ham and also cubes of kielbasa instead of bacon. And I've replaced the Parmesan with Ricotta for a richer filling.  I'm convinced that there is no way to mess this recipe up-it turns out perfect every time.  Thanks Anita-your recipe is great as is, but serves VERY well as a foundation for changes!",

Others mentioned that the green pepper didnt work for them; it worked fine for me so I think its a matter of taste. This is definitely a keeper for me",
