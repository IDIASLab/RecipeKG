I followed as written, with the exception that I did not use Kikkoman branded sauces and I used half of a spatchcock chicken instead of drumsticks.   After the hour in the oven, I returned the chicken to skin side up and broiled on low until the skin was lightly browned.   YUMMY.   I then removed the chicken to a plate to rest for a few minutes.   While this was resting, I combined 2 Tablespoons of corn starch with 1/4 cup of chicken broth and mixed into the remaining sauce.   I added in 1 teaspoon of soy sauce as well.   I brought this to a slow boil while whisking until my desired thickness was reached.   The sauce was a fantastic dipping sauce and was also a nice topper for my fried broccoli and fried rice.   The chicken was fabulous and the sauce put it over the top.   Definitely will make again.   Thanks!",

Oh and I don't have any green onions either so I added one tsp of dried chives to get that hint of onion flavor. We'll see...will let you know!!",
