I had no problem with the meat boiling dry but to start I put probably about 1/2 inch more water in it than the top of the meat when I started boiling it. I put the potatoes in 15 minutes after the carrots and onions to be sure they didn't get too mushy. Put two bay leaves in when boiling the meat and some black pepper as suggested by some. My family loved this soup. My husband HATES spicy foods so he was thrilled with what some called \"bland\" as was my daughter who has stomach issues with spicy food. I personally like spicy so I added some Spicy V8 to the soup I had and it was perfect for me. Easily modifiable to suit individual tastes a bonus! This is a new favorite for my family because it was quick easy yummy and healthy! Can't get any better than that (unless someone else does the cooking for you lol)!",

Not trying to bash but I followed the steps as they were written filled the water just to cover the meat as written and boiling it for 30 minutes on high heat reduces your liquids as it did mine. I could see bringing it to a boil and reducing the temp for a bit but to hard boil not just one round of 30 minutes but 2 rounds was a bit much but I kept at the directions as written and by the time I got to step 3 there was not much to drain off. I was consistantly adding water to bring the water amount over the meat and veggies. By the time I did get to step 3 the potatoes render down to partily mush and I originally opened a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and used half but then ended up adding the entire contents of the can. This recipe to me would be a better slow cooker recipe then the steps it took to get to the end result. While it reminds me of my moms old fashion vegetable soup we were always adding hot pepper sauce and spices to each bowl way back when as this is what we did in the end of this recipe too. I'd try again only to be placed in a slow cooker and adding garlic oregano basil possibly a bay leaf and some heat.",
