This was easy for even me! I read most of the reviews before making and I added parsley to the egg itself and sun dried tomato to the feta mixture. I can see why others thought this was bland--it does need a bit of jazzing up. I used plenty of salt and pepper especially since I used egg beaters. Not entirely sure how I did this but I made the two omelets in batches and ended up with 3. I served with toast and pears--nice breakfast thanks for the recipe.",
