My husband ended up with a whole flat of strawberries from a local farm, so I was really looking for something different to use them in.\n\nThis was the perfect use for them.  Like some of the other reviewers, I added more strawberries (4 cups: 2-pureed and 2 sliced), cut the oil down to 3/4  cup, and only used 1.5 cups sugar since my berries were fairly ripe.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla.\n\nThis had a wonderful texture and flavour.  I will definitely make it again!",

I halved the recipe to make one loaf - used 1/4 c olive oil, 1 1/2 c strawberries (I sprinkled them with sugar, then smooshed them up with my fingers), 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tbsp vanilla extract. It was perfectly cooked after 45 mins. The consistency was light, the sweetness spot-on, and the strawberry flavor was just right also. I served this warm with a little fat-free Cool Whip and a sliced strawberry garnish. Thank you, Ellen, for boosting my baking confidence!!",

My family was pleased with the results.  I would definitely make this again.  I was feeling lazy about washing two loaf pans so I baked it in a bundt pan.

I also threw a half of a tangerine rind into the processor as well.  I decreased the oil as suggested to 3/4 cup and decreased the cinnamon to 1/2 tbsp. Added 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  This bread was perfect!  The flavor of the strawberry, spice, and tangerine essence gave it such a nice spark.  Took this to a meeting at work and everyone raved.  I also made some cream cheese spread w/ 8 oz. cream cheese, 10x sugar to sweeten, and grated lemon rind.  It complimented this very nicely.",

The predominant flavor was that of cinnamon. If I were to make this recipe again, I would increase the strawberries - perhaps to 3C - and I would decrease the cinnamon. Additionally, I would consider dicing the strawberries instead of slicing them (or slicing them thicker) so that chunks of fruit would be visible when slicing the bread - like one would see in a blueberry or cranberry bread.",

I mean, it's so much easier when you've had 100s of people try & revise it to PERFECTION!  1. 1st time I made this, I cut the ingred down to only make 1.  BIG MISTAKE! So much better to make full amount so you can slice and then stick in ziplock bags in the freezer.  Breakfast on the go, just heat for 50sec in the microwave!  2nd, 4Cups of strawberries are a must (2 diced, and 2C smooshed w/bottom of measuring cup).  3. Dump the 2C of sugar on top of strawberries, gently mix while mixing rest.  I just dump all in the ingred in one bowl then gently fold. Can't taste the difference when separating dry with wet first. 4. Tasted wonderful with half wheat flour  5. Use one snack size container of unsweetened applesauce then fill rest of 1C measuring cup with oil! 6. With or without vanilla, everyone always says it tastes the same!",
