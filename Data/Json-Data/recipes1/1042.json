It's my birthday and I really wanted some good old ginger snaps but don't know where my recipe box is.  I was so disappointed when all the other recipes on here had only 1/4cup of molasses!!  I was worried about this recipe not having any baking soda or such, but they turned out beautifully!  I did make a slight adjustment, I used only 2 tsp ginger and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ground cloves because I like my cookies spicy.  To me, that's how good old fashioned gingersnaps are!!  I also used blackstrap molasses, which is the best of the best (aka strongest) and it has 20% of your calcium per tablespoon so these cookies are good and healthy too!  I did have to flatten them before cooking since I skipped the roll them out part.  I just make tablespoon size balls and flattened them.",

I work with a guy that I have given them to twice and he told me that he has loved ginger snaps since he was a child and said that these...by far...are the very best that he has ever had:) These are a definite must try for those ginger snap lovers out there.
