Truth be told I always give a second glance to cookie recipes with cream of tartar and oil (and generally confectioners sugar is in there too) because I like the texture of the cookies made with those ingredients. These cookies turned out just how I expected. They re light and crispy on the edges soft in the middle and maybe just a little greasier (I wish there was a better way of describing that characteristic but I have word block right now). They re not dry or crumbly let s put it that way. I used Nestle Buncha Crunch (little nuggets of Nestle Crunch bars) not because I thought they d be better than chocolate chips and walnuts but only because I had them to use. I love these cookies. I wouldn t say they re better than others I ve tried because they re different than some of my other favorites. If this indeed is what Famous Amos cookies taste like and if I was so inclined to buy cookies rather than making them I d buy these.:) Addendum: Hubs who is notoriously stingy with 5-star ratings rated these as such without even prompting him for an opinion. Because they're different he said.",
