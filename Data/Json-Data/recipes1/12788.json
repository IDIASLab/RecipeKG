You should only use fresh crab meat...the canned taste was unmistakable (I thought that with all the yummy sounding ingredients the canned taste would cook out)",

Someone complained of the artichokes  overpowering the dip- I thought it was terrific since my family and I love artichokes (my kids favorite vegetable).  If you're after more of the crab flavor, scale down the artichokes, don't use them, or use more crabmeat. I have always noticed that artichokes in dips are the most dominant flavor. Like other reviews stated, this recipe can be adapted to many tastes, i.e. using shrimp, lobster, etc.  I actually didn't have cheddar or montery jack cheeses, and substituted asiago cheese and it was great.  Looking forward to making it again with the correct cheeses.",

I don't think that 1/2 tsp of dried dill is overpowering for this recipe.\n\nWhile I love capers, a lot of people do not, so I used non-parielles which are smaller. I would certainly increase the amount of crab, using either all lump or a mix of lump and back-fin depending on the size of my wallet. I think a bit of sherry or white wine would be an acceptable addition. Or some lemon juice.",

The sourdough 'dish' is brilliant.  Served this with wheat thins also, but may put some salt in next time, and serve it with Carr's Table Water crackers.  God I could eat this entire thing alone.",
