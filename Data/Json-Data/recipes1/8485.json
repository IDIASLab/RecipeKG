Any way, after the beef was almost cooked I drained the fat and added chopped onion and cooked until the onion was softened. I added a packet of reduced sodium taco seasoning and a little water so the mixture wouldn't be dry. I did bake the pie shell for the full 15 minutes it called for. If you add the beans into the hot shell it it easier to spread and you wont have the tearing. I added the cheese then the chips on top this prevented the cheese from overcooking. When it was done I topped the pie with olives diced red onion and taco sauce. I served homemade guac. and sour cream on the side. The whole family loved it and they want me to make it again.",

I added the refried beans, some green peppers, the onion, a little cumin and garlic to the beef and simmered it for a while. Some of the reviews said that the crust was soggy so I just baked it according the directions on package instead of baking it half way like the recipe called for. I was prepared to put foil on the edges to prevent burning if necessary but it wasn't. I layered the beef/bean mixture on the crust and mixed in some grated cheddar,next I added a thin layer of salsa (very thin). It seemed that it might have been bland without it. Next came the crushed chips and more cheese and then I baked it until the cheese melted. My kids loved it. My picky 3 year old, my 7 year old who hates beans (he didn't know they were in the beef) and my 9 year old who hates cheese. They all asked for seconds.Thanks Carole for a new family favorite.",
