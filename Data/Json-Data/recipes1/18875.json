It's a quick fix for a party, one batch goes a long way, and it packs a great flavor punch for how easy it is!

I ended up adding more beer to make it a smoother consistency. I'm not a fan of this served cold, so I served it right away at room temp.  Note: there is no need to warm up the beer, since you normally make beer cheese with room temperature beer - which was the intention judging from the recipe creator's original recipe, however the edited, published version implies warming the beer.",
