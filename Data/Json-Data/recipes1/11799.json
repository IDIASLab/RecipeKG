I wouldn't take it to a potluck but I can't say that if I wound up with an abundance of strawberries that I wouldn't make it either...I added a bit more lemon because it seemed a little too sweet for me and made it with dream whip (the kind you mix up yourself) instead of cool whip that could have made a bit of a sweetness difference. Good recipe but I think I would've preferred to spend a little more time to make a traditional strawberry pie. Thanks for the recipe though.",
