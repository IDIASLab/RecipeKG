I did however make one change. I used dark brown sugar instead of white. Using the dark brown sugar gave it a lovely aroma so good you won't mind the stiring time while waiting for it to thicken. Once it had thickened I removed it from the heat and spooned the filling into the tart shells I had made. I think it would yield about 20 but my crust recipe only made 18 so my daughter and I had fun liking the spoons and cleaning out the pot. My daughter is very picky and she loved the flavour. She asked me to make her some without a crust since she doesn't like crust. I think it would be lovely that way as well. I am giving this recipe a 4 because as I said it was a great starting point I just prefer the brown sugar flavour.",
