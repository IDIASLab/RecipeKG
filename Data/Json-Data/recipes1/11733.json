At the other reviewer's suggestions I used a higher quality lamb meat and made sure to trim half the fat to allow a little extra to flavor the dish since most of it seems to burn off. I also added couscous instead of the bulgar and it seemed to be just as good. I added a little extra cinnamon too. The raisins added just the touch of sweetness to compliment the dish but my boyfriend hates raisins so I drizzled a bit of honey over the top of his dish and he said it complimented the flavors very well. I'm definitely keeping this to make again and I'm eager to find some sides that will pair up well with this main course. Perhaps something a bit spicy?",
