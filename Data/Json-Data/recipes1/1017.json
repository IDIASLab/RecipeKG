I make it whenever I have company, serving it hot out of the oven with a dollop of vanilla bean ice cream! I am always flustered by the overwhelming compliments.  Warning, though: this pie is messy - don't expect a clean slice!!!! Also, I usually end up filling 2 pie crusts with the filling (it makes a LOT) then double the topping recipe. DEEEEE-LISH!!!!",

I've made this three times now,\r\ntweaking it a bit each time and this last time was the best.  \r\nNotes: 5 and a half granny smiths instead of 7 okay.  May want to lower tartness by using a couple\r\napples of a different type.  Add 1/3 cup brown sugar in the filling along with the 1/2 cup\r\nwhite sugar.  Add 1/8 tsp allspice, 1/16 tsp ground cloves.  Cut apples really thin and spiral when laying\r\nit out in pan.  Crumb topping is a bit powdery, needs work... turns out crispy and sweet which works well\r\nwith the tartness of the apples.  May lower heat a bit since topping was dark.  Didn't affect taste, just the look.\r\n",

I must have sliced my apples a little too thin because the filling came out like applesauce (after all that work of spiraling them!) and I like a little stiffness to my apples so you can tell they are apple slices!  The topping was great - beware to not pat it down too firmly or it becomes very hard. Can't wait to try the topping just crumbled on top.",
