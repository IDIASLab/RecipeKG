However if you want to add extra spices I found that mustard powder garlic and/or a sprinkle of nutmeg worked well with the potato and leek flavors. We also ate it with a toasted piece of sourdough bread (yum!) I'd also suggest adding the milk directly into the bowl. That way each person can control the soup's consistency to their preference and I didn't have to worry that the soup had milk in it that might spoil if I left it out for a couple hours or if it took more than a week to finish (which it did). I think we used more potatoes than were called for; we didn't have red potatoes so we had to guess but we used up the last of our baking potatoes (6 of them). It made enough for 2 people to eat for a week.",
