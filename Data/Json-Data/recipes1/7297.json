The internal temperature of the bread may not be high enough for long enough to kill bacteria.  Plus, the jars need to be sterilized prior to filling as well. Thus, might not want to store for an extended time.  The recipe is great and we enjoy giving as gifts too.",

My parents have 3 apple trees so I'm always trying to find different ways to use the many apples they always give me. It's wonderful they can store for a year-I might be making these again just for us this year and storing them for our use. These are absolutely wonderful served warm with ice cream. Yum! Thanks a lot Julie! BTW I did sterilize the jars before filling and baking them. Once baked they sealed well and we had no issues whatsoever when we ate some 4 months later.",

Just before they were done I threw the lids and rings in boiling water to sterilize and they sealed wonderfully.
