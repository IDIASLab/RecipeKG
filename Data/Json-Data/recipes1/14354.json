I also added a 1/4 tsp more of the extract and used a few drops of red food coloring adding one drop add a time.  After adding each drop I stirred it just enough to give it a swirling effect.  Without the red food coloring it was a pale yellow/cream color which I thought was unappetizing.  I cooled it in the fridge then cut it into 1 inch squares.  I brought a plate of it to a holiday party and the hostess was kind of upset that all of my candy was eaten and her fancy sweets from the bakery were leftover.  This is a GREAT recipe.",

Everyone who's tasted it raves about it, even my 3 kids who don't care all that much for peppermint.  A few trial and error tips:  Last year I added the red food coloring and the fudge came out pink.. I wasn't really pleased with that.  This year I left out the food coloring altogether and I think it's much prettier this way.  Also, there is no need for the added fat of \"greasing\" the foil.  Use Glad's Press and Seal Wrap (make sure you refrigerate for the full 2 hours!) and it peels right off with no sticking.  Also, make sure you use candy canes that are easy to crush.  If the chunks are too big the fudge won't cut easily.  Last year I used the individually wrapped, round peppermints but I thought it was better this year using regular, cheapo candy canes.  I put a tin of this in all of my Christmas packages this year, it's a nice change from the traditional chocolate with nuts fudge that everyone else makes.  Now somebody please stop me before I go eat it all!",

I only used 1 cup of crushed candy canes. I added about 2 tsp. of peppermint extract though so that you could actually taste the mint. I colored it red- and thought it to be a bit of an eyesore. I didn't have any extra candy canes to crush and sprinkle on but that would've made it look great. Instead I had some green mint chips. I melted them in the microwave and spread them over the fudge. It was green and red layered- it really added a lot to the presentation. I will try this with milk chocolate too. Thanks.",

I followed the recipe the first time exactly as follows (with red food coloring) and it turned out wonderfully.   **One tip I found to be helpful: Spread the liquid fudge into the pan before adding the food coloring, then add in only a couple of drops in different spots and swirl the color gently with a spoon. The fudge will cool quickly but this prevents the fudge from turning all pink and gives it a gorgeous red and white swirl, similar to a real candy cane.  I am about to make another batch right now and will be giving as gifts to my coworkers this year.  Happy Holidays and thanks for this recipe!",
