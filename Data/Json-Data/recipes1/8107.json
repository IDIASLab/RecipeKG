It fell apart and had no taste. Yes it was moist but it was so moist that it stuck to the top of my mouth and was incredibly difficult to eat. But I still was willing to give the recipe a chance. I thought with some changes I could make it have some flavor. No amount of changes will make this recipe good. I have made three cakes based on this recipe all of which are inedible. I am very good at baking. Almost everything I make turns out well. This recipe seems like it should be good but it is in fact the worst recipe I have tried on allrecipes.com.",

I did not have round cake pans so I baked in a 9 x 13 square pan and crossed my fingers. The cake was done perfectly at the recommended time! I need to update this two days later - after the cake came out of the oven I frosted it 24 hours later. It was good then. I had some the next day (48 hours on the clock) and it was FANTASTIC. Do try to make this cake 2 days ahead if possible it becomes more moist with time!",
