Otto considers himself an expert on Sauerbraten so I was a little nervous about making this for him. He hates when he orders it from a restaurant and they only sour the gravy and not the meat. Well he went nuts over this fabulous dish!! I did add more seasonings to the marinade but those were the minor changes I made. I was happy to see that there was at least one sauerbraten recipe that called for marinating for five days. In a pinch you could get away with three. Any good German would laugh at anything less. Thanks so much Amy and Dad thanks you too!!!!",

I followed other reviewers' advice and after marinating for 4 days I cooked the roast in the crock pot with all the liquid. Dinner's not for a few more hours but I had to try a piece and oh my goodness! The meat is AMAZING! Very tender and flavorful. Both my husband and I LOVE German food though I've never tried making sauerbraten before. I was a little nervous since I'm not that fond of very vinegary foods but this is the perfect blend of sweet and sour. I'm serving it with red cabbage and potato pancakes. I can't wait. ONE warning to anyone trying this for the first time - this will smell up your whole house! I could even smell it OUTSIDE the house. I'm going to try boiling some vanilla on the stove after dinner to see if that gets rid of the smell.",
