I boiled my potatoes with skin on and peeled and sliced when they cooled down a bit(much easier.) I used less potatoes than called for 8oz. package of bacon 3/4 cup onion and doubled the rest. I like lots of sauce so I gradually added my potatoes to my liking you can use leftovers for hash browns. Thanks Tequila!",

What's great is the addition of the celery seed, gives it a tiny little crunch but a ton of flavor. I always use cider vinegar rather than white but don't know if that makes a huge taste difference...maybe a bit mellower. I quartered the potatoes to cook them, then made it easy on myself and sliced them with an egg slicer. Perfect size. Also, just before serving, I topped it with a handful of minced fresh parsley which gave it a wonderful fresh flavor boost. This was a great side to my grilled brats from the German butcher.

She had made notes on it about the ingredients (ie: use approx. 3 pounds of potatoes, cider vinegar not white, a bit more bacon if available, boil potatoes whole and slice, use red potatoes, use a bit of brown sugar). She added more liquid (if it was too thick) more vinegar (if it wasn't tart enough), etc. She always made adjustments according to the circumstances. I have added my own twists - like a pinch of dry mustard for a tiny bite and stirred in chopped chives or scallions at the end for a burst of flavor. Her final note was \" start here for good potato salad.\" It has all the basics you need to make a great Hot German Potato salad - so this is indeed - a good place to start.",
