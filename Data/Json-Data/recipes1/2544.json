I have since made it with the Grape Nuts and also like it that way. One modification I have done is cut the sugar in half and used half honey in lieu of half the corn syrup. Comes out great either with oatmeal or Grape Nuts. Oatmeal version is softer more like a traditional Power Bar; Grape Nuts is crunchier more like a dessert I think. Regardless of which way they're made they're great!",
