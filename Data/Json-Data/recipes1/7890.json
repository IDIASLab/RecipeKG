I used Krusteaz pancake mix since that's what I had on hand and Dubliner Cheese. It's a great sharp white cheddar. Since I precooked the sausage I added one egg to help the balls hold together better...and I couldn't resist adding a Tbsp of real maple syrup. They also required less cooking time...about 10 min. These were a big hit with the family! I served them on the side of some home-made roasted tomato soup. It was the perfect snowy night meal!",

For those who don't care about the shape substituting Velveeta (or similar cheese) melted in the microwave makes it easier to mix and gives a more \"cheesy\" flavor but the balls sink andn come out more like small cookies.
