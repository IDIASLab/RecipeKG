I made the balls bigger then what the recipe called (about the size of a small plum). and I added a bit more cherries and less walnuts and they were just awesome",

Last year we weren't able to get together so I was very excited to find this recipe so I could make them on my own! I do NOT like cherries but they are chopped and add just a hint of flavor. It sounds crazy to add all these different flavors together but it is oh so delicious! You can make a batch and keep them in the freezer and just pull them out a couple hours before needed! Yummy goodness!",
