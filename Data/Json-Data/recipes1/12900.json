We are talking raised in northern Italy folks. Well, I made a few adjustments, to make it a bit easier. I used Barilla oven ready lasagne noodles, mixed my ricotta with 0ne egg and 1 frozen, but thawed and squeezed dry box of spinach. I thickened the bechamel by using 4T of flour instead of 2, it was very runny with just 2. (Dont skip the nutmeg, this is a great flavor complement. For the meat I used 7oz each of ground Buffalo, pork and veal. (Veal makes a difference, dont just use ground beef) and instead of tomato paste, I added 1 16oz can of wild porcini marinara.(found at Trader Joes) This is going in my forever book here at home. Not too saucy, not too cheesy, PERFECT!",

One thing for new cooks making bechemel sauce, make sure you use whole milk. I tried making it once with skim milk and it didnt work. You need that fat in there. You can make the meat sauce a day or two ahead so it will develop its flavors more :)",

No real need for a pasta machine  here. You can also make the pasta sheets the night before, layer between wax paper and refrigerate to expedite things in the kitchen  the next day.(do not cook pasta until ready to use)\r\nI decided to double both sauces just in case I felt a single batch was too little.  (another reader complained of too little sauce) If you use a small food processor to chop your vegetables  you will be done in record time.\r\n I used most of both sauces when I assembled the lasagna. What a delightful  aroma while the Ragu was cooking.\r\nThis is not difficult, it just sounds that way. \r\nExcellent  flavors! Do try this one, you will be pleased, my guests certainly were.\r\n",
