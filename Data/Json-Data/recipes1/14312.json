We took three recommendations from reviews that really helped the strawberry cake to turn out great! \n1~ We seperated the egg whites and yolks and whipped the egg whites and then added them in to the mixture.     2~ Also we sifted the flour and then after sifting measured it again. \n3~ We spread strawberry puree in between the two cake layers along with icing to make them stick together well. (mmmmm!!!:D)Furthermore we made the strawberry puree by blending clean, cut strawberries together in the blender which made a really fresh puree. As a finishing touch, after icing the entire cake with vanilla icing, we placed extra sliced strawberries on the top of the cake! The cake was BIG hit but make sure to make room in the refrigerator for leftovers!",

                "reviewBody": "A little sweet for me, but Hubs loved it.  Pretty pink, lots of strawberry flavor.  I creamed the butter, sugar and gelatin well, as directed, adding the eggs one at a time and beating well after each addition. I added the flour in thirds with the milk AND the strawberry puree, beginning and ending with the flour. This differed from the instruction to add the puree at the end.  To give the cake a little extra lift I used a full tablespoon of baking powder.  Also, salt makes flavor come alive, so I added a teaspoon.  The batter was so light, fluffy and voluminous I felt better using three pans rather than two and I'm glad I did.  I filled the cake with my own strawberry buttercream: 2 c.  powdered sugar, 1/2 c. butter, approximately 2 T. of sweetened strawberry puree and a dribble of strawberry extract.  It was awesome good and complemented the cake perfectly.  I frosted the cake with \"Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting,\" also from this site, which Hubs and I both agree was a major disappointment and, in our opinion, ruined what otherwise would have been a perfect cake.  The strawberry buttercream I made for the filling would have been perfect to frost the cake as well and in hindsight I wish I would have done that. This cake is fluffy, moist and flavorful - pretty too! If I have any criticism at all, it would be that using the gelatin kind of turned me off. I would much rather find a true \"Strawberry Cake from SCRATCH\" that didn't use it.",

After reading all of the reviews I carefully measured the flour after sifting and I beat the egg-whites separately.  I used slightly less flour and butter hoping to make the cake fluffier.  It still ended up being a fairly dense cake (but still delicious).\n\nI made the strawberry puree from scratch just using strawberries and sugar.\n\nFor the frosting I used a homemade whip cream with more strawberry puree.\n\nI used 3x 9\" pans for a triple layer cake.  In between the layers I placed thinly sliced strawberries on top of a thin layer of icing.  I covered those with splashes of the strawberry puree then added more frosting.\n\nTo top it off I soaked halved strawberries in more puree and placed them on top.\n\nThe only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it didn't come out as fluffy as I would have liked.  However I'm not much of a baker so it's just as likely my fault as it is the recipe.  But my wife loved it so I'm in her good graces until next year!\n",

I used the remaining strawberry puree mixed it with some extra chopped strawberries sprinkled it with sugar and a little cornstarch. After mixing it and letting it sit I poured it between the layers and frosted the top and sides with my buttercream frosting. Delish to say the least!!

                "reviewBody": "For those of you who complained about the cake being too dense, try cutting back on your flour.  A standard cake recipe usually calls for about 2 1/4 cups of flour, not the amount listed.  That amount would work well if your 9\" pans were at least 2\" deep, and most standard ones that we have in our kitchens are not.  Also, decrease sugar down to 1 cup.  The gelatin is going to add a LOT of sweetness...I found this out the hard way making this recipe with a boxed cake mix.  It was way too sweet for me, but everyone else loved it.  I also cut back to only 3 eggs and took everyone's suggestion and whipped the eggs whites, folding them in at the end.  Also I only used 1/2 cup of butter but also added 1/2 cup of oil.  I kept the milk the same and actually blended the strawberries, milk, and oil all together to make a puree, almost milkshake-like in texture and added it to the creamed sugar, butter, and eggs.  Then I mixed in the flour just for a minute and continued to stir by hand, so as not to over-beat the batter.  My cake came out perfectly, very moist (a little delicate, but the boxed version did, too), and just the right amount of sweetness.  My cake is going to get lots of whipped cream and a white-chocolate custard filling between the layers.  :-)  --You can make your own cake flour by taking out 2 Tbsp. of flour from each cup and adding 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch back in.  Sift 4-5 times, THEN scoop out the amount you need.--",

Definitely follow the recipe exactly otherwise it can turn out a bit dense. I make mine in a 9x13 cake pan. For a yummy light frosting I blended together 8 oz of cream cheese with a container of cool whip and 1 tsp of vanilla.",
