As I was printing off the recipe for this Christmas prep, I read some of the more recent comments, and decided to add what I've learned in the past couple years: there's a big difference between doing it the day before vs the same day.  When made the day before, it's stiffer and the sour cream and garlic (if you add that, as I do) are twice as strong.  Much too strong, in my opinion.  And you will need to re-mash with milk and butter to fluff it up, which means you lose half the benefit of doing it ahead of time.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend doing it only a few hours before (3 or 4 has been just right, for me) and then putting it in a slow cooker on low until dinner.  The flavor is prefect and it's still fluffy.",

Followed recipe as stated, but prior to baking I used 1/2 cup of whipping cream and butter to moisten the potatoes. Mixed in some bacon bits and cheddard cheese. Topped off with bacon bits and cheddar cheese before baking. The end result...my dish was completely empty and still had people begging for more.",

My husband won't let me make our mashed potatoes any other way because he says 'nothing compares'! The 'signature' really boils down to the cream cheese because many mashed potato recipes are made with the other ingredients but the cream cheese really sets these apart from all others! However I do make it slightly different from what the recipe calls for. I also add a little skim milk to it as well as use fat-free cream cheese and sour cream and interchange using onion powder one time and garlic powder the next just for variety. And of course the measurements of the ingredients are never the same each time so I put a little in of everything until it's just right smooth and creamy. I've never made these potatoes the 'day before' but serve right away. However I always make enough for leftovers and they're delicious cold or hot the next day! Give these a try you won't be disappointed!:) Thank you so much Erin for the wonderful recipe!",
