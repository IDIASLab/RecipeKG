All you could taste was citrus & garlic.  The drippings made a horrible gravy when used even sparingly (were you even supposed to use these drippings?).  Very difficult to believe this recipe WON a contest.  Maybe if you grew up eating something like this & are used to it - I can possibly see stomaching that.  Tried to salvage the gravy by dilluting it with canned gravy and thought it was OK - to no avail.  Some people put the gravy on the turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes etc. which essentially made it inedible.  Ended up throwing a lot of food out.  The overall turkey itself was OK once you got past all the garlic & citrus outer coating.  For the holidays tradition will always be followed from now on - NO lemons/orange concentrate/massive garlic.  Just roast & baste the thing.\nI also found it difficult understanding the glowing reviews this recipe received???\nUnfortunately I had to learn that tradition should rule the hard way.",

I left the marinade in the bottom of my roasting pan and used it to baste the turkey every 30-45 minutes. After the turkey was cooked, I made a pan gravy with the drippings/marinade mixture by whisking in about a 1/4 cup of white all-purpose flour. Let that darken, whisked constantly to prevent lumps, then added about 2 cups reduced sodium/fat chicken broth, and some whipping cream (maybe 2-3 Tbsp., and one grated carrot (optional-lemon zest would be nice, too). Whisked misture constantly, letting it get to the desired color and thickness. Served the gravy with the turkey and the combination was out of this world!",

I was impressed with the color of the finished bird and how juicy it was when we started carving it. And as soon as you put it in your mouth it melts.
