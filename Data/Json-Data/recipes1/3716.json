And with no 5-spice no creme fraiche and no sour cream I used (don't laugh) ranch dressing ground cloves ground cinnamon basil parsley and ground black pepper I also threw some crunchy chow mein noodles on top before serving. Maybe I changed too much but my wife ate it and I'm looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow.:)",
