Therefore I gave it a 4. I added a 2nd egg per some other suggestions as well as 1/2 tsp of cinnamon 1/4 tsp of nutmeg a dash of ginger and 2 tbsp of white sugar. They were actually very good. My 16 year old raised his eyes at the carrots but ate a couple and said that they would have been better with some chocolate but otherwise were pretty good. My 7 year old turned her nose up at the carrot cookies but after I forced her to try one she sheepishly ate every last crumb and my 2 1/2 year old ate 3 and said \"delicious!\". With the addition of the spices these were not bland at all. I cooked them for 14 minutes and they were not dry at all either only light and fluffy and yummy... although I may sneak in some semi-sweet choco chips next time instead of the 2 tbsp of sugar.",

Per other user's suggestions I added cinnamon nutmeg another egg a little applesauce and 4 tablespoons of sugar just to make sure it was sweet enough for the kiddies to enjoy. I did have to add more flour to make the consistency thicker. Even with all these additions they were still somewhat bland but tasty enough for my kiddos to enjoy which was all that mattered to me anyways.
