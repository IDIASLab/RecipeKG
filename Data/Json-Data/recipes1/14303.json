The only thing I will do different next time is put the flaked coconut in the blender/processor with the milk and cream of coconut.  The flakes made the ice cream a bit chewy in texture.  Otherwise, this recipe is very easy and extra creamy.  For those reviewers that are saying theirs turned out icy or not sweet, there is a huge difference between cream of coconut and coconut milk.  It is like the difference between evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milk.  Two brands to look for in cream of coconut are \"Coco Lopez\" and \"Coco Colada\".",

Substituting coconut milk for coconut cream would be like substituting evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed milk.  That being said, since I didn't have coconut cream, I substituted with a (14oz) can of sweetened condensed milk instead and added 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of coconut extract.  It turned out excellent!  The second time I made it as directed.  Both times were delicious.  ",

This is also one of the easiest ice creams I've made as it calls for so few ingredients and no extra steps like cooking the custard or mixing and chopping. This is a lovely, pure white ice cream, easily adaptable to endless toppings or additions if you choose, though it is perfect just as is. For this occasion I just drizzled some chocolate syrup on the plate and added a few fresh raspberries and chopped chocolate covered almonds. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but chopped the coconut finely in my food processor. I added the coconut to the cream mixture and then let it steep its flavor into the mixture while chilling in the fridge for several hours. This is one of those few recipes that exceed your expectations. ",

I used the Coco Lopez brand as suggested by ALBERTACF and it was right on! It is found in the mixers (alcohol) isle at your market. The kind you find in the Asian isle is coconut milk, at least at my market. Thanks, SueMB, for sharing this recipe and ALBERTACF for the clarification between the two (cream/milk)!",

There wasn't much coconut flavor (even after adding 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract) or much of any flavor really (even after adding 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract). The taste wasn't bad but definitely wasn't good either. I know what you're thinking: \"Oh she used coconut milk and not cream of coconut like the recipe specifies \" but you're wrong. I DID use cream of coconut I even double-checked before using. Even after making it I checked to see if I had accidentally used my coconut milk instead of my cream of coconut and nope the coconut milk was still there. I'm not sure what went wrong. Was the cream of coconut rancid or something? Or was the brand of cream that I used just not good?",
