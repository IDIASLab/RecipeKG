I used my pampered chef small cookie scoop to shape the balls so it made the job quick and easy.  I rolled the first batch in white sugar as the recipe called and I could see that it was going to make alot of cookies.  So for the next pan I used cinnamon and sugar mixed together and the next cocoa and sugar.  It made for a nice variety and quite beautiful!  I will be keeping this recipe forever.

But butter is so much better! I never thought of using butter till I saw this recipe. The cookies are just awesome. So tender, yet crisp, they really do melt in your mouth. I flatten mine with the bottom of a drinking glass dipped in sugar rather than with a fork. It produces perfectly smooth, gorgeous cookies. These guys are too fragile to frost (if you did manage to spread frosting on without breaking them, they would absorb the moisture from the frosting and turn unappetizingly soggy) but colored sugar sprinkles is an option.",

I decided to scale the recipe down to 24 servings and it still made 4 dozen so I would suggest not making them at full recipe. To make the colored sugar just put a half a cup sugar and a drop or two of food coloring in a ziplock bag and mix it around. It works great. These cookies will get great results no matter where they are served! Thank you for sharing the wonderful recipe.",
