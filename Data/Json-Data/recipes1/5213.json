I took the advice of several other reviewers and decreased the amount of cornstarch (3 Tbls),sugar (1/2 C), and vinegar (1/8 C) in the sauce, but added 1 tsp of chili flakes instead of the peppers at the end.  Also, I cut out the deep frying, as we are trying to cut out the fat in our diets.  I just simply stir fried the chicken in a bit of vegetable oil and added the sauce and green onions.  We didn't even miss the heavy breading!  We served it over steamed rice and had some steamed snow peas to round out the meal.  I'll definitely be adding this figure friendly version of our favorite take-out to our regular menu!",

It was the best General Tsao's I've ever had; better than any restaurant - and this is my normal entree when i eat Chinese.\r\n\r\nI would have to add,though, that I modified the recipe slightly. I cut up the chicken and marinated it in 1/2 cup each of soy sauce and hot sauce (Texas Pete) for 4-5 hours. I drained off the liquid before performing the chicken preparation portion of the recipe.\r\n\r\nI substitued 3-4 Tbsp crushed red pepper for the peppers in the recipe, as the dried peppers are not available in my small town.\r\n\r\nIn the future, I would also probably increase the sauce by another half, just because I'd like the chicken a tiny bit saucier, and this sauce quantity was just enough to glaze the chicken.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I have to add this this recipe will now become part of my family's repertoire.",

There is plenty of flavor enhancing going on with the sodium in the soy sauce. Also for a nice decorative touch add a cup of shaved or thin diagonally sliced carrots. Over all this a goooood eats!",
