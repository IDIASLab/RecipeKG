This is a substantial cookie full of rustic texture but still chewy. I used 1/4 cup ice cream scoop mounds flattened them slightly and baked them about 10 minutes. The only thing I'll change next time I make these is toast the pecans first but this is no criticism of the recipe which is perfect as is. Not only are these delicious (a great GUY cookie!) but they're beautiful too.",

If I have a nut-averse crowd, I used more Rice Chex. (Also, I use an ice cream scoop for dropping the cookies onto the pan. The size, I think, affects how chewy or dry the cookie will be. Ice cream scoop size makes for a good sized, chewy cookie.) Yummy and reliable.",

This is the first chocolate chip cookie recipe I've made in quite a while that turned out perfectly consistent cookies... Still chewy not DRY and crumbly.... Even down to the last cookie in jar! I made the large batch as given and they didn't even last our family a week. Look forward to trying the freezing suggestion. Thank you SO much for this wonderful recipe. Your graciousness will be cherished by our family for life. (recipe may just make it in to our holiday festivities in the form of a stocking stuffer;)",

But this time around I followed the advice of other reviewers and only processed have of the oats leaving the rest whole. I used an even mixture of semi-sweet and white chips for this and added dried cherries in place of the nuts since my hubby and son both have allergies to nuts. I also took the ice-cream scoop tip from another and the recipe made 24 HUGE cookies! Delicious!",
