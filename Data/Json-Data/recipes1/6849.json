I quadrupled the recipe in order to can it (I was able to can 14 quarts plus served dinner to my family of 8). I had to add chicken broth to make it a \"soup\". I added about 3.5 quarts of chicken broth for the quantity I made. I then found the juice to be too runny and there were still tons of veggies. I took about 3 blender fulls and pureed it then put them back into the soup. This gave it a great balance of soup and veggies. I also added a good amount of garlic simply because we like it. I plan to use this recipe a lot this summer to help preserve the abundance of zucchini from our garden. For those interested in canning it I pressure canned it at 11 lbs pressure for 90 minutes.",
