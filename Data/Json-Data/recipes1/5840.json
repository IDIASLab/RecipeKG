I doubled the amount of kidney beans and added one small can of tomato sauce so that the crock pot would at least be 2/3 full... The chicken was grilled in the electric grilling machine - no plug here for brand of appliance used:)!!!! Then it was topped with sliced green onions and a dollop of sour cream. The piece de resistance: good ol' cornbread.... YES! Thanks for sharing this recipe.",

The extra minutes spent in sauteing the vegetables and browning the chicken paid off in enhancing the flavors, I think. I wasn't expecting there to be enough chicken in this recipe, but it was plenty, as it turned out. It wasn't very hot, but the spice mixture was very tasty.\r\nI think I'll make this for The Woman I Love someday soon. Thanks for a great recipe.\r\n",

Instead of chili powder i used chili sauce which may be the reason i got a sweet sauce can't think of what else caused it to be sweet maybe the tomato paste??...but in any case it was great!

Red pepper tasted better than green used a little less onion on second recipe little better that way. Didn't like crunch of celery so added carrots second try little smoother. Spices were a good combo could not taste cocoa powder maybe just deepens color a bit. Nice recipe to adjust spice on just add more crushed red pepper or cayenne if you want it hotter.",
