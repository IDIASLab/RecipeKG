I actually weighed one can of beans and while it was a 15-1/2 oz. can, it weighed just 8 ozs., which was perfect to scale this recipe down to half. I sauteed the vegetables in butter first (used jalapeno for the hot green chile pepper called for), then added the drained and rinsed beans, the seasonings, and 1 cup of chicken stock. I was too chicken to use the full amount of balsamic vinegar called for, so for this half recipe I added only 1 T., half the amount called for. I simmered it all, uncovered, until most of the stock was absorbed. This was just delicious and pretty on the plate. Hubby said he hates black beans, but he likes these since this wasn't as spicy or hot as some black bean recipes are. This was the perfect accompaniment to our Cuban meal of Sea Bass Cuban Style, Saffron Rice and Jicama Salad with Cilantro and Lime, all recipes from this site.",

It'd probably be best to use half the amount given as it is a touch overpowering (although it is a nice flavour). I would also agree with one of the comments made that sweating the onions and peppers on their own while the beans cook would improve the flavour. Plus add the spices towards the very end of the bean cooking as the flavours tend to boil out after such a long time. Still - all said and done it is a nice way to use black beans it's dirt cheap and it can be reheated in all sorts of different ways! Great rolled up in a tortilla with the sour cream!",

Reading other reviews if you substitute white vinegar for balsamic it will be sour balsamic vinegar has a richness and sweetness to it that white vinegar has none of.
