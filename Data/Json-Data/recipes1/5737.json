After all, I figured that \"making do\" was half the point of the recipe. I used dried cherries instead of raisins, and was out of cloves, so I used allspice instead. I also added 1/2 tsp. ground ginger.\n\nI let the boiled mixture cool a while, but it was still rather warm when I mixed it with the dry ingredients. It actually foamed a little. I have no idea if it was supposed to, since I know very little about baking. \n\nThe batter was very thick, almost like bread dough. My oven runs a little hot, so I checked it after 20 minutes, and it was done already. The cake was quite moist so I wonder if some folks cooked it too long. \n\nThanks so much for this easy and delicious recipe!",

While my Mom baked endless cookies for our large family, this was her reward at the end of a long season, a piece of pork cake.  Her recipe called for one pound of ground pork fat, so I've been looking for something a little \"less threatening\" to one's nutritional body.  While it was indeed the best thing around, this recipe is similar minus a few ingredients.  It was good, a bit too crumbly but I like the use of shortening over the pork fat.  I'll play with it a bit.  Also perhaps adding spices when you heat on stove might bring out the flavor a bit more, as I like the spice intensity of old bread.  I also put in two 9 x 5 pans.  I'll add molasses as that was in old recipe and see if that will add a bit more moisture to it.",
