This wasn't it but it was absolutely delicious and I'm glad I tried it. It has a mildly sweet flavor that complements my blackened talapia toning down some of the spiciness. Easy to make too. It was great without the cilantro and extra onions but I might try them next time just to see the difference. The slivered almonds are a must though.",
