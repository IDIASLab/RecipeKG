I also sauteed some cut up chicken tenders and added them to the mixture to make this more of a main dish. I boiled some leftover fresh broccoli instead of the frozen kind, and I used regular white rice with a packet of chicken seasoning.  I put a lot more shredded cheese on top, so it took a lot longer than 10 minutes for it to melt and brown, but the result was excellent.  Next time I might add onions and mushrooms!  Great recipe.",

I used Velveeta brand cheese cut into small pieces. After the rice cooked I added the cheese to the top of it covered and let it sit for 10 minutes so that the cheese would melt. I then added the broccoli 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper stirred it all together and poured into a 3-qt. glass dish. Thanks so much for the recipe!",
