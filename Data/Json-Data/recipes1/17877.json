I used red wine instead of the vinegar, used a little less tarragon, and I stirred in 2-3oz of goat cheese right at the end.  The goat cheese totally changed the taste of the sauce from really good, to amazing!  When doesn't goat cheese make things better?  Thanks for a great recipe!",

As I didn't have some of the items I improvised :) I used a Topside Beef Roast, I couldn't find Taragon Vinegar, so used Red Wine instead. Also didn't have fresh Taragon so used approx. 3/4 tablespoon of dried Taragon. Everyone LOVED it. It was so tender and the sauce is excellent. This is a definite keeper. Thank you so much for sharing it with us.",

But I gotta say, the flavors of the porcini mushrooms and the tarragon vinegar and tarragon really overpowered this dish.  Next time I\u2019m going to substitute just regular mushrooms, add more chicken stock (instead of mushroom water), and use white wine in place of the tarragon vinegar. At the end I will add a little bit of parsley as opposed to fresh tarragon. All that aside - the meat was perfect. My tenderloin was 2.8 pounds. I seared it for 5-6 minutes per side and had it in the oven for exactly 45 mins. My thermometer read 130 - the meat was perfectly rare but not purple.",

I also didn't have tarragon vinegar so used white whine vinegar and couldn't find dried porchini mushrooms so used a combo of 3 kinds of mushrooms.  I will find the correct ingredients next time.  I had just sharpened all my knives and felt like a professional butcher following instructions for trimming and tying the roast.
