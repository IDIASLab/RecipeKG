Then, I would add the yolks in with the other ingredients while mixing.  Next comes the main difference -  beat the egg whites until stiff ( not dry ), and gently fold them into the sweet potato mixture.  Bake immediately after topping.  Add marshmallows the last 15 minutes of baking.  ( Do not open oven while baking and handle casserole carefully as this is truly a souffle with the eggs added this way. ) I KNOW you will love it prepared in this manner.  Enjoy!

A few things I tweaked were:  used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, I used brown sugar instead of white sugar in the sweet potato mix (and used a bit less than a full cup), and I seasoned it up with a good dose of cinnamon, nutmeg, and all spice.  I think I'll use even less sugar in the sweet potatoes next time because it really doesn't need it.  But this recipe is definitely a keeper!",

I feel like a pro when I make this.  I also baked the sweet potatoes wrapped in foil with butter in the oven for about half an hour each side.  I don't care for recipes that call for boiling vegetables in water.  When these came out of the oven I was able to gently slice down the length of the potato and the skin came off very smoothly.",

It was so sweet no one during Thanksgiving dinner could finish their serving. It was sweeter than the pumpkin pie and apple pie we had for dessert! I think it would be much better if the recipe called for half the sugar and reduce the amount of the brown sugar & pecan topping.",
