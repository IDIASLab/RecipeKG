My recipe is different only that I use 2 eggs instead of 4 so if you are short of eggs...I'm telling you they turn out awesome with 1/2 the eggs. I let them cool and top with a dollop of chocolate frosting - boil 6TB butter 3/4 c sugar 1/3 c milk for a minute remove from heat and add 3/4 c chocolate chips stir until thickened. You must try these cookies!!! Update for those having trouble getting the cookies off the waffle iron...you might want to give your waffle iron a spray of Pam before you drop the cookies on after you make them a couple of times you won't need that. Also I use a Pampered Chef cookie scoop and drop into each compartment. Have never put chocolate chips or nuts in them I wouldn't suggest it though.",
