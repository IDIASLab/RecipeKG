Also, I use the crunchy kind, so no need to add peanuts! I'm going to try this in a wrap with chicken and veggies and I know it will be superb!",

I used coconut sugar in place of the brown sugar and will need to find a replacement for the siracha sauce since it has sugar. Even with my changes it was AMAZING! My whole family loved it. I served the sauce with chicken satay (from this site),  rice noodles and green beans.  I also topped with cilantro and diced green peppers  as recemended . I would have added some some peanuts but did not have any, I am sure that would make it even better.  I used the sauce to flavor everything on my plate. Having this sauce made up ahead of time would really make for a quick meal after work.  I would give this more than five stars if I could. Also..... The recipes calls for a very small can of coconut milk (5.6 oz),  but I I used about 1/2 a standard can and it worked perfect. I will be adding this to one of my favorite all time recipes. Thanks!!",
