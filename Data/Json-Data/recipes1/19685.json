Not in a bad way but it didn't seem worth the trouble to make the fig filling if I can't really taste it. I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe it needs more fig or something that pulls the fig flavor out better. I may experiment next time and use the fig more as part of a sauce like another reviewer did.",

I soaked the figs in pomegranate juice as directed but just couldn't bring myself to throw it away. I added 1T of sugar and reduced it into a syrup which I used to coat the figs/shallot mixture instead of honey as well as to flavor the meat. Overall we thought these were very good but there were so many deep rich flavors going on I found myself longing for a bit of tartness. I wish I'd used a bit of goat cheese instead of the gruyere.",
