I like several other reviewers miss the old Bundt Cake mixes. I have to say this will make you forget your yearning! Cathy's filling and your easy-to-do cake mix will create an awesome cake. Use the Chocolate Glaze I submitted by Jennifer to make the perfect topping for this dessert.

Used unsweetened coconut in the filling mixture and put all the coconut in on top of the first half of the chocolate batter then added the rest of the chocolate batter so it gives it a tunnel-of-coconut effect. (I found it worked best to sort of mold the coconut mixture into a rope and lay it on top of the batter--it's sticky and clumpy and hard to spoon.) Instead of the frosting I made a glaze by heating 3/4 cup heavy cream and adding 6 oz bittersweet chocolate then cooling to 90 degrees and pouring it over the top of the cake.",
