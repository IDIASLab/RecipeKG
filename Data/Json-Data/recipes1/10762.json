I peeled and microwaved my potatoes in a covered dish with a few tablespoons of water until they were mostly cooked.  I added water to the soup instead of milk, to cut some fat and calories.  I didn't even miss it - the soup was creamy enough on its own.  And I added about 1 1/2 cup of frozen peas, a generous amount of black pepper and onion powder (don't care for big chunks of onion!)  Rather than doing layers, I just mixed everything together then spread it over the sliced potatoes.  \n\nPre-cooking the potatoes was a huge time saver.  I baked the casserole for 25 minutes, then topped it with a few slices of swiss cheese and baked another 6 minutes until it was all melty and bubbly.\n\nI can see how some could find this bland - I really did hit this with a lot of black pepper, even adding more on top once it was on my plate.  But the flavors all went really nicely together and my husband and I both enjoyed this meal.  I will definitely use this recipe again the next time I have leftover ham.",

With my modifications I give it a 4-5. I used a V-slicer on the 'fine' setting to slice the potatoes & onions. I sauteed the onions until golden brown then added the soup & milk and brought it to a simmer. Then I added 1 small crown of broccoli chopped fine (using V-slicer on stems) & simmered for 5 min. I layered the sauce potatoes & ham in a glass casserole dish (10\" across) 'lasagna style' with 4 oz shredded pepper-jack cheese (there were 3 layers each of potatoes ham sauce & cheese). Baked as directed. Topped at the end with 1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs mixed with 1 tbsp melted butter & 1/4 cup Parmesan. It turned out wonderfully; lots of flavor & fully cooked.",
