                "reviewBody": "I love this recipe; it's a hearty, stick-to-your-ribs breakfast. The following are a couple tips for the best pancakes. Don't thin the batter with more milk. This washes out the pumpkin flavor. Instead, the batter should be portioned out with a 1/4 c. measure onto a moderately hot griddle; then the batter should be spread out slightly using a spoon or a small spatula. This creates the fluffy texture while keeping them hearty. Second, I used a food processor to mix up the wet ingredients. This makes a smoother batter as it breaks down the fiberous pumpkin. The result is a lighter pancake with a more pronounced pumpkin flavor. Third, I used a fresh, good quality pumpkin pie spice rather than measuring out the individual spices; this is an easier preparation, and the flavors were fresher  (I get my pumpkin pie spice from a local spice shop that grinds and mixes it weekly for the best quality). Fourth, I got the best results either using whole milk or evaporated milk. Low-fat and fat free milk products just left the flavor dull.",

I thought the pumpkin taste was too weak originally, and it lacked a true \"pumpkin recipe flavor\" without nutmeg.  Also, the cinnamon flavor was not noticeable.  Here are my suggestions:\n\n1.  Add 1 1/3 cups pumpkin\n2.  Add 1 Tbsp Cinnamon\n3.  Add 1/2 tsp nutmeg\n4.  Delete the allspice, vinegar and ginger\n\nHere are my ingredients:\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n3 tablespoons brown sugar\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1 tablespoon ground cinnamon\n\u00bd teaspoon nutmeg\t1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 1/2 cups milk\n1 1/3 cups pumpkin puree\n1 egg\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n\nIt makes a nice dense pumpkiny flavor pancake that is fantastic with any decent syrup.

I followed many suggestions in the reviews (2 eggs, 1 cup whole wheat PASTRY flour) and tweaked it even further.  My daughter had just eaten at a trendy breakfast cafe in Ashland, Oregon and claimed these were even better...lighter, etc.  Extra suggestions...add fresh nutmeg (1/2 t.), ground cloves (1 t.) increase cinnamon to 1 TABLESPOON and ground ginger to 2 teaspoons, brown sugar to 4 Tablespoons, ditto oil.  Also increase leavening to 2 TABLESPOONS ( I use only Rumford's and NO baking soda at all).  Finally, mix w. 1 plus cup of milk, let stand to absorb the dries and then add MORE milk to get that perfect pancake batter conistency.  Works well as waffles, also.",

When I see a recipe calling for milk and vinegar, these two mixed together give you an emergency substitute for buttermilk.  Next time I will go ahead a use buttermilk!!!
