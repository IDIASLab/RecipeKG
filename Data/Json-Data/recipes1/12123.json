I've never had a problem with soggy rice this way - cold rice works the best.\n\nI found the original recipe too salty, so I cut the salt in half and use only 1 1/2 tablespoons of soy sauce.  Everyone can always add more later to taste.  Add the bean sprouts in step 3 as others have suggested.\n\nI also agree that the dish is better if the eggs are(partially) precooked. Here's what I do: When it comes time to add the eggs, move the rice/shrimp to the sides of your wok/skillet (be sure to use a large one) making a well in the middle.  Pour in the eggs w/ salt and pepper, scramble after they've begun to set, and then mix with the rice/shrimp.  This saves messing up another pan!  (One trick I retained from another, not so good, fried rice recipe.)\n\nIf you want to use small shrimp, add it later to avoid overcooking.  Sometimes I substitute brown rice for white.",

The recipe's simple nature allows the cook the flexibility of adding other ingredients if they so desire. In my batch of rice, \r\nI added peas, extra bean sprouts, and cooked the eggs prior to adding them to the rice.  With my next batch I will saute my (yellow) onions with the uncooked rice first prior to adding the water.   This will add flavor to\r\nthe rice itself, and make the rice fluffier.  Overall, it's a real crowd pleaser, and maintains its flavor the next day!  Try it!",

When you make this, if you are using a pan used a really really large one!!!!. I did followed the recipe, but added a little 5 spice powder at the end of cooking for more flavor, also omit the extra salt, soy sauce is salty enough. Another tip (do not over cook your shrimp as you will be adding to the pan which will cook more). My shrimp came out wonderful!!!..Like everyone else I added the bean sprouts in step 3... PS USE ONLY REQUIRED AMOUNT OF SESAME OIL VERY STRONG FLAVOR. UPDATE!!!! I HAVE SINCE PURCHASE A WOK AND I TRIED THIS RECIPE AGAIN, IT WAS GREAT THIS TIME I USED A NEW TIRCK FOR THE RICE, OTHERS STATED RICE WAS SOGGY, IT'S TO MUCH TO COOK THE RICE THE NIGHT BEFORE ECT ECT. WELL MY TRICK IS TO BUY READY MADE RICE. I USED UNCLE BENS GARDEN HARVEST, IT'S READY TO USE ANY TIME FROM PACKAGE TO WOK OR PAN, AND IT ALREADY HAS PEAS IN THE RICE. AND NOW HAVING A WOK HAS MADE THIS DISH SO MUCH EASIER. MY RATING IS GOING UP FROM 4*** TO 5****",

I also used 2 cups rice and reduced the soy sauce to 2 TBLS. Finally, I scrambled the eggs in a seperate pan.  VERY delicious! This will be my shrimp fried rice recipe from here on out!
