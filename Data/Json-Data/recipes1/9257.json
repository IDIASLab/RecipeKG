I, on the other hand, thought it a little too rich, a little too sweet, and had too many flavors going on, so we'll settle at four stars between us.

I have made it three times since then as well and my pie plate always leaves emptied. It is simple no bake yet still fills the kitchen with tropical flavor. Can be made to be a very attractive desert with toasted coconut and cherries. Ann",

Had extra filling and didn't want to throw it away, so I took someone else's advice and put it in a covered bowl in the freezer. One guy at the BBQ said the filling reminded him of Ambrosia Salad, and I agree. Great, cool pie on a hot day!",
