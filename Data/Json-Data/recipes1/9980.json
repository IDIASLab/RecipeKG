A superb blend of ingredients that created the perfect dish. But when I make this again, I'll do it a day in advance and simply reheat it the next day, especially if I make this for guests. All the prep and clean-up will have been taken care of. Also, nine cups of liquid takes a long time to reduce--much longer than 2 hours. Even at 2-1/2 hours I still had to thicken it up with a bit of cornstarch. Finally, no matter how lean the ribs are, there is still a lot of rendered fat. Making these the day before will allow me to refrigerate them overnight and then remove all the solidified fat. The extra work involved and the long cooking time, however, is SO worth the effort. The ribs are full of beefy flavor and fork tender. The gravy just can't be beat--intensely rich, brown and full-flavored. I served this over polenta and it brought me right back to Grandma's house in my childhood. Mom came for dinner and she happily took what little leftovers there were home! ",

This is so easy even if you are not a regular cook you can do this and wow whomever you are cooking it for. We felt like we were eating at a 5 star restaraunt lastnight. I used a semi-sweet semi-dry red wine in this to have a happy medium in the sweetness level. This was the first time ever for me trying to make short ribs and I am not sorry that I did!! MM MM....good! Hats off to the creator of this meal. To thicken the sauce at the end I used a bit of cornstarch instead of flour. Was worried that it would have that raw flour taste in the background. The cornstarch was perfect. Please do try this over buttery mashed potatoes it gives it that added heaven not to mention it makes it that much more filling. Don't pass this one up try it you will not be sorry.",

I did follow another review and use top of the line meat from Gelsons so there was less fat. I didn't think the fat was an issue at all. The broth barely had any fat floating at the top. I altered the recipe for 3 servings, and added more veggies 1 hr in. I made the mistake of cutting veggies too small and they just disappeared after 2 hrs of cooking. My son who doesn't like veggies loved the carrots and even the celery! The flavors are amazing. the key is to cook until the sauce thickens (without a lid) so that there isn't \"so much liquid\" as other reviewers noted. You could probably 1/2 the broth portion if you were using less meat, basically have enough broth to cover over and cook the meat for 2 hrs and that should be enough.",
