It was my first time cooking zucchini and he was NOT a fan of that but personally I loved it. The salt & pepper and tomato sauce were just a nice light touch of flavor to complement the yummy potatoes and veggie mix. I would cut the onion and peppers in larger chunks next time they sort of got lost since I diced them in smallish pieces. The roasted potatoes were my favorite part - perfectly cooked and many had a nice crust on them. I pre-diced my onions pepper and tomato the night before and it was super easy to throw that in the roasting pan in the oven and while that was cooking for its first 20 minutes I was able to dice the zucchini and prep the meatloaf so it was quick and easy for dinner prep on a work night.",

                "reviewBody": "So delicious! I never liked meatloaf before but figured I'd give it a try because my hubby likes it. I made a few changes and it was the tastiest thing ever! I used 2 green bell peppers and no red. I thinly sliced half the onion to cook with the veggies and chopped the other half into tiny pieces and put it in the meatloaf with the parsley. A little extra garlic never hurts! Instead of tomato sauce I used a 6oz. can of tomato paste and 2 cans of water. I will admit it was a little dry for my taste a little extra sauce never hurts either! Italian bread crumbs are fine if you don't have regular but I think Italian adds a little more flavor. What really made it yummy was the cheese I added. Seperate the meatloaf into 2 parts. Shape the bigger half into a loaf and add slices of cheese on top of it. Any cheese any amount is fine. I used 3 slices of provolone and it was great! Next time I'll use a few more slices. After the cheese is added shape the remaining meat mixture over top and cook! You can use whatever kind of veggies you like I'm sure all would be delicious! Just remember that if you use zucchini or squash to put it in at the same time you put the meatloaf in so that it doesn't get to mushy! Thanks for the recipe!",

The only thing I'd reccommend is possibly using less potatoes and making sure to slice them ultra thin so that they cook in the amount of time needed for the meat. The only thing I changed was slightly extending the cooking time (it helped the loaf stay together more) and adding about a half a cup of ketchup to the 8oz tomato sauce. Otherwise a definite treat! I will surely make it again! =)",
