This was very close but I did make adjustments to try to duplicate the restaurant recipe. I used 3 cans of great northern beans and I pureed one of the cans to give a little thickness to the soup/chili. I also added 4 minced garlic cloves. I had no turkey so I sauteed 1 1/2 lbs of chicken breast tenderloins. I added about 1/4 teaspoon of allspice to give it some depth and added dried cilantro to taste. Left out the cheese & parsley cuz I forgot:) This is an excellent winter time recipe. Very healthy too. Thanks so much Mickie.",
