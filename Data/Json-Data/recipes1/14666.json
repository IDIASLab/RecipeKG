                "reviewBody": "Many thanks for this lovely recipe! Prior to whisking egg yolks with the sugars and spices be sure to remove the 2 'strings' from each yolk or add step of straining it before pouring into ramekins. The hot cream should be added about 1 TB. at a time so yolks won't curdle. Lastly: a bain marie (water bath) is necessary for a creamy texture so ramekins should be placed in a 1-1/2 inch deep baking dish placed on oven rack and hot water poured into dish to a depth of 1/3 the ramekin. Be sure to check at 13 mins. - a knife inserted about 1/4\" from center of ramekin should come out clean and this means it's done as they will continue to cook once removed from the oven. This recipe is also nice with the ramekins coated with caramelized sugar and served as creme caramel which is how I did it since my torch isn't usable. I topped with a TBsp. of whipped unsweetened heavy cream (the more cream bacon or butter in a receipe - the better!). Plan to serve in the small squash shells for Thanksgiving.",
