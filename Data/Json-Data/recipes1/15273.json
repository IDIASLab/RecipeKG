I served it at a party, and got rave reviews -- two people even asked for the recipe!\n\nBased on the feedback of others, I started out with only 1 tbl of sugar, then added more to taste.  The end result was probably close to 2 tbl.  I also added a bit of lemon and lime zest to the dressing.\n\nWarning: I think this recipe ends up closer to 10 servings.  I had to make it in my huge wooden salad bowl, because even my largest mixing bowl wasn't adequate.\n\nBy the way, this is even better after a few days, when the flavors have time to fully meld.  I usually make this at least two days ahead of time.",

I like to add powdered garlic, and extra cilantro. I use Great White Northern beans instead of Cannelini. Red onions add a pretty color. We make this all the time! I am confused by the raters that say there is too much dressing... I think the amount is right on. Although I do use a can of corn instead of frozen... maybe the extra liquid comes from the frozen corn. Sometimes I add a can of chopped tomatoes. You can add any veggies you like, the salad doesn't care. I would give this more stars if I could.",

Way more than enough dressing...cut it down to 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup vinegar, but keep the rest of the ingredients as stated for marvelous flavor.  Add some minced jalapenos for spice!",
