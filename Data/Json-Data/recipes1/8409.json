I put in my food processor and added the liquid a little at a time until I got a good thick dip consistency. I think I ony used half of the reserved liquid. And I also added a little onion salt. It's a good recipe to play with and make your own but is it good? YES!",

I had had a leftover lentil salad that didn't go over real well with my boyfriend so this was a great way to do something with the leftovers (plus it took less than 10 minutes to make). The mixture was a little thick for my blender so I dribbled in some chicken stock to thin it out a little. I also added more cumin than the recipe called for because I love cumin so much and I added a bit more garlic. My girlfriends loved it and so did I. I also got rid of the leftover lentil salad without having to throw it out and waste it!",

I followed the recipe fairly closely only using olive oil instead of vegetable and making a crushed red chili pepper/paprika substitution for the cayenne pepper as I didn't have any. I did not add salt (nor would I say it needs any) and used all the liquid. I tried the dip after mixing it all together and felt it wasn't quite what I wanted. I added about a teaspoon of lemon juice and that did it for me. Who needs chips? I could eat this with a spoon! Four stars for the dip before the lemon juice five for easy prep and with the difference the lemon juice made. Thanks for sharing a great recipe Noni!",

The appearance of the dip is completely unappetizing. It's a kind of yellowish greenish goop. I made it for a potluck and it was virtually untouched. I sure won't be making this again.",
