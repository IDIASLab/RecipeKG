Unfortunately I never thought to copy her recipe before she passed away. I have searched for YEARS (I kid you not!!) for a recipe like hers that wasn't prepared with purchased sour cream, and this recipe is it!!  I'm so happy to finally have a copy of what she used to make, and have made this pie 3 times now with complete success.  The only thing I do differently is chop the raisins, since that's what my grandma used to do. Thank you again for submitting this and for bringing back such wonderful memories of my grandma's pies.",
