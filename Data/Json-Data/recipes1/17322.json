I have tried this as written and it was ok a 4 star recipe. With these modifications they are excellent: 1/2 tsp vanilla increase sugar to 3 tbs and instead of nuts drizzle dark chocolate. Now a 5 star sure to impress. Also the easiest way to stuff is to take a little of the bottom so the berry 'sits' then slice off top and green then at the top core the berry to make a hole.
