I think this recipe is the exception. I included the full amount of cardamom, the 2T of oil and used Guiness Draught (1.5 bottles). It turned out perfectly! The crust is a bit chewy, the center is soft and fragrant. The spice level is well balanced.  I'll definitely be making this again!",

I used half regular flour and half whole wheat and used a Bud for the beer as that was what I had. The bread came out very moist even without adding the oil but I honestly couldn't taste as much of the spice as I expected. I'll probably make it again as it does have decent flavor and texture otherwise but I'll try to have all the ingredients next time.",
