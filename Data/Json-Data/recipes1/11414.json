Thousand Island dressing is not one that we typically use on salads but every now and then we do like it. I love being able to mix up just enough to use for one or two meals rather than buying a whole bottle and then having it sit in the fridge for six months. We used this on reuben sandwiches and it was REALLY good. Used Duke's Real Mayonnaise the South's best:-) One comment about the recipe description. I used Heinz chili sauce so there was nothing spicy about this. Definitely a keeper.",

The green pepper and pimento were interesting and unusual additions that contributed great flavor texture and color. Right after I prepared it I felt it was too mayonnaise-y so I added the same measure again of chili sauce therefore doubling it. After a few hours in the fridge the flavor had developed and melded and it was much improved. Hubs said he would have liked this either way - as written or as I ultimately served it with double the chili sauce. We had wedge salads with our entrees tonight and while I enjoyed the traditional blue cheese dressing on mine Hubs preferred this dressing on his. Fantastic complement to the Classic Wedge!",
