I think green onions would be nice too. Oh and there is no way this makes 4 servings. We got 2 out of it with no seconds. I think we will make this again with the said changes and will double it.",

I put the parsley in with the boiling potatoes and when I pureed them it turned kind of green! So be careful of that! All in all pretty good but still a little bland.
