So keep in mind that when you increase liquid ingredients like wine and lemon, it will take A LOT longer to reduce for a sauce, and chicken breasts (especially pounded thin) should NOT cook in a sauce that takes more than 10 minutes to reduce-- I cooked mine for about 10 min., removed to a platter, and continued to cook down the sauce, which took another 20 min. at least!  BUT-- very tasty when all was said and done!",

While I didn't measure exactly, I can say that I essentially used for two chicken breasts what the recipe intended for one.  As an example, a cup and a half of wine for just one chicken breast does seen like a LOT, doesn't it?  As does 1/2 T. of garlic and a half lemon, however, these amounts were just right for two chicken breasts.  I browned the chicken in olive oil rather than vegetable oil, tho' that's just a personal  preference.  Also, since I don't drink Chablis I used what I had open which was a Pinot Grigio, and Chardonnay would have worked well too.  The butter at the end, just as it is with Veal or Chicken Piccata, is essential. It not only thickens the sauce but gives it a velvety richness as well.  I garnished this with lemon slices and chopped fresh parsley and served it with an herbed Parmesan orzo. (Pasta with garlic and olive oil would also be ideal!)  I have to admit I was tempted to substitute chicken broth for part of the wine but in the end decided to prepare this as written and was not disappointed in the least.  This is just a beautiful dish!",

Instead of just 1 chicken breast I used 4, seasoned them with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I also seasoned the flour with those same spices.  Instead of 1/2 tbsp garlic I used 3 cloves crushed and fried the chicken in butter therefore omitting the end step.  I also cut down on the wine to half and the rest I used chicken stock.  All in all it's a good premise but I knew just by looking at the recipe that it needed some adjustments.",

It turned out so delicious and yummy I'm definitely going to make this again. It was easy to make but also complex tasting - that combination is always nice. As other reviewers said it takes longer to reduce the liquid about 25-30 minutes for me. It did remind me of Chicken Picatta but I liked it a lot better because it tasted more appropriate for chicken whereas the Picatta sauce seems more appropriate for fish to me. This would be a great recipe for when guests come as it doesn't require much prep or time but is somewhat fancy & delicious to be able to serve.",
