The only veggie I added was green pepper only because I had one.  I will use a large red onion next time because we love the carmelized flavor of the onion under the broiler. I also sprayed my veggies with balsamic vinegar for some extra \"zip\". Served the veggies on hearty multi-grain rolls from Whole Foods - - use the best bread possible because it truly will make or break the sandwich.  Excellent recipe, Heather!!",

We put it in italian-seasoned focaccia and after the veggies were done (we grilled them on a gas grill), we assembled the sandwich and wrapped in foil and put in a 350F oven for 20 minutes.  Incredible.  I want another one already.  For us, this made 2 very large sandwiches.  UPDATE: we've made these about once every other week and we still haven't gotten sick of them.  Make sure and make the sauce about ahead of time and let it sit for about an hour in the fridge to mix the flavors well.",

Grilling the veggies really gives it a nice smoky quality that tastes great. I added a bit of garlic, rosemary, thyme, fresh lemon juice, kosher salt, and cracked black pepper to the olive oil to baste the veggies while grilling. I also grilled some thick sliced tomato along with the other veggies and opted for some mild cheddar cheese vs. feta. This was great on focaccia and I'd love to experiment with other types of bread - this recipe is a definite keeper!",

I had some doubts even after reading all of the other positive reviews because I didn't know how well my meat-eating preponderantly male family would take to an all-veggie sandwich. They loved it - and so did I. I only had minced garlic so I roasted some of that in a glass dish in my toaster oven for the aioli. I used sliced red and green bell peppers zucchini fresh sliced mushroom tomatoes and carmelized onions for my vegetables. I didn't have rosemary so I just used dried basil and parsley instead. I used Monterey Jack cheese and used English muffins as my base - yum! I'll definitely definitely be making these again. Thank you for the recipe!",
