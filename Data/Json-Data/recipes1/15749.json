We have learned that we detest all packaged hollandaise sauces EXCEPT Knorr Brand Hollandaise and we usually add a teaspoon or two of fresh lemon juice to it if we have lemons in the house. (I tried making hollandaise from scratch and actually PREFER the Knorr stuff. Crazy huh?) One thing we always include in our eggs benedict is steamed broccoli florets. Steamed the broccoli for about 5 minutes, sprinkled it with a little garlic salt and lemon pepper before adding to the casserole. Served that yummy sauce on the side. I must not have done a very good job with the cooking spray because I did have some trouble with sticking. So it isn't our beloved eggs benedict that we will always consider quite special but what it is we enjoyed very much and it freed me up to relax and visit with our guests! Tasty with hash browns, chilled canned pears and maybe even a bloody mary! YUM!",

I made it exactly as stated in the recipe.  I would not \"ruin\" it by adding cheese to it, as some reviewers have suggested.  Let the hollandaise sauce shine thru, for something special and different.  The ONLY suggestion I would make for improving it would be to make homemade hollandaise sauce---it is just that much better than the packaged variety and is not much more difficult than making the packaged kind (both you have to whisk it and watch it carefully on the stove as it thickens).  So, the packaged variety doesn't really save you that much work.",

Used a pound of bacon fried and chopped in place of the Canadian bacon. Used 5 green onions replaced onion powder and salt with 1-1/2 tsp of onion salt and added fairly generous dashes of black pepper. When finishing used real butter instead of margarine and added 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of lemon juice to the hollandaise sauce before pouring it over the casserole. We liked it even better this way and hash browns and orange juice made this complete. Another tip for leftovers - serve hollandaise sauce on the side so everyone can add the amount they want and then put remainder in frig with main casserole leftovers. When reheating heat separately and both will seem fresher than if refrigerated and heated as one dish.",
