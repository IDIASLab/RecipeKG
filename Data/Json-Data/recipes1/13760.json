Even my son the picky eater ate 2 bowls. Personally i didnt put it in a blender til smooth. I used a potato masher, left everything in the pot and mashed it up some in the pot. I used larger chunks of potato so i was able to just mash those up into smaller ones. Topped it off with light cheddar, bacon bits and chives. I didnt hold any of the potatos back in reserve. I didnt even use any oil as it said to do so i could cut the fat count down further. Great recipe and great base for other things. Thanks.",

I always end up using at least 4 cups of chicken broth but it's really up to your preference for how thick you want your soup. Definitely roast your garlic in the pan with the potatoes (I always throw in a couple more cloves than called for). Also I like to sprinkle some oregano or thyme on the potatoes & garlic mix before roasting for additional flavor. I've done this recipe with peeled potatoes and with skin-on and it comes out great either way. When we have leftover ham adding it to this soup really kicks it up a notch. Serve w/ homemade garlic parmesan bread. Yummy!! Thank you for the recipe!",
