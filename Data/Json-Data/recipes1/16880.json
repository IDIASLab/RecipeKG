I am not a cook, in fact, I think of myself as a terrible cook and I wanted to simply buy the frozen slab of turkey meat for Thanksgiving last year.  But my bossy little sister forced me to try to make a \"real\" turkey.  So she taught me how to search all recipes and we found this.  It was FANTASTIC.  Everyone loved our turkey, even my fussy \"no-processed-food-ever-amazing-cook-sister\".  I am going to use this every year!!!!  The turkey really does stay incredibly moist and it was delicious.  Make sure to search the for the video.  Last year it was linked right there with the recipe, but this year I had to do a google search to find it.  His step by step easy to follow video really helped.",

It coats the skin well enough that it doesn't burn or need covering; &, of course, tastes delicious!  I combined recipes which basically means, I used olive oil on, & some butter in the turkey.  Also put an apple inside - & a T of the seasonings.  I used a cup of apple juice & a cup of water in the pan.  Gravy was dark, but very good.  When turkey time comes again, I'll follow the recipe better.  :)  Note4Me: Coating: 2T Kosher, 1T freshly ground black pepper, 1T poultry seasoning, 1/2T sage",

Made up the butter mixture the spice mixture & cut up the veggies ahead of time; helping us get the turkey into the oven so easily come Thanksgiving day. I was shopping for a recipe because it was time to help my daughter learn to roast a turkey & I want her to learn to cook better than I myself can cook. Yes my 12 year old daughter & I had prepped a turkey together once before following another method which didn't work as well as my 'decent' turkeys of the past. So we went shopping together for a new recipe. She was utterly sold on your approach. I let her take the lead. She loved watching your video and her jaw dropped when she watched you loosen the skin on the breast with a rubber spatula (yes another thing I'd missed out on in the past but thanks to you my daughter will have an easier time of it!). I do plan to obtain a fresh turkey which we can brine next time but I want to incorporate much of what we learned from you modifying for a brined bird. Will try to remember to let you know how that goes if we proceed as planned..... Either way thanks so much for helping my daughter's second turkey far exceed anything my mother or I put on the table throughout our entire lives! Gotta love it! Thanks Chef John!",
