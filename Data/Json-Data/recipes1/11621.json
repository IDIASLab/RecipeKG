I made a roux out of the butter (I only used 1/4 cup) and 1/4 cup flour, cooked this for a few minutes and then whisked in the half and half.

I found the consistency of the sauce perfect you just have to cook it until it thickens. Try adding a bit more parmesan if won't thicken fresh parmesan works best. Not everyone in my family likes the asparagus so I cooked it separately and added it only for those who will east it. Thanks for the recipe!",
