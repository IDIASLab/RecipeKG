Six servings comes out to: 1/2 pound cream cheese, (8 ounces) softened, 1/2 cup butter, softened, 3 cups confectioners' sugar and 3 tablespoons maple syrup. -- Double the above amounts if more frosting is needed...and more WILL probably be needed! Not that it didn't make enough...but it's good enough to eat right from the spoon! =) I suggest making an extra batch and storing it in the fridge for pancakes and/or french toast the next morning. Great recipe! I used it on a \"Maple Pecan Butter Cake\" and it was THE perfect frosting! NOTE: I used only HALF the conf sugar and with the maple syrup it was PLENTY sweet...but if you like it *really sweet...go for it and use the entire 3 cups. :) ",

To make it a little less sweet I like to use 1 tsp. maple flavoring (found next to vanilla extract at the grocery store) instead of syrup.

As a couple other reviewers suggested I too used only an 8 oz. block of cream cheese a stick of butter (1/2 c. worth) 3 c. confectioners' sugar and 3 T maple syrup (to begin with...). I also added a 1/2 t of maple extract (one reviewer suggested adding a t but that was based on the recipe as is; since I scaled this I only added half that amount). After everything was blended I \"snuck\" a taste and decided to add another T of maple syrup (now 1/4 c. worth total as per original recipe) and another 1/2 t maple extract - perfect! My fiance really liked this (he snuck a bite too!) which surprises me because he isn't a cream cheese fanatic. His only complaint is that this was a tad too thin. Oh well that's an easy fix (just refrigerate it). My cupcakes looked so cute with a small amount this frosting piped on (a little goes a long way IMHO) and a sprinkling of maple sugar! Thanks for sharing your recipe Caitlin. I'm sure this would be yummy on spice cake / cookies too!:-)",
