I have used different types of butter/oil that I've had on hand.  I works well with vegetable oil and it makes them flaky.  When I use shortning or butter, it makes them more fluffy.  I usually add 1/2 teasp. more of baking powder when I am making big ones.  It helps to keep them from being so heavy.",
