I used 3lbs of fresh tomatoes cored peeled and then I let them run in the food processor on high for 4 minutes. I used that instead of juice. It had a few seeds that didn't get pulverized but it certainly didn't hurt the soup at all. Also I added about 1/4 cup of fresh basil chopped up at the point I added the tomato and I let that cook in with it and I used a pinch of baking soda and a tablespoon of sugar to help reduce the acid in the soup. I didn't do it this time but you can also substitute whipping cream for the milk to make it a little more rich. All I can say is awesome Julie! A frozen pizza darn near takes longer to cook than this.",

I added a carrot, a clove of garlic, and a stalk of celery to the onion sautee and pureed it along with some of the milk and tomato juice before adding it to the roux. Made the roux with the flour and a little corn meal(masarepa) to make it thicker. Also substituted some light cream for some of the milk, and served it topped with fresh, chopped basil and fresh black pepper. No extra salt was required because the tomato juice was salted.\n\nExcellent, thick and creamy. Great on a cold, damp day with roasted potato wedges, crusty bread, and green beans.",

I have a tomato garden in the back yard so I blanched pureed and strained the seeds out to make my own tomato juice. However I'm sure it would taste fine with store bought. I pureed the onion too to achieve a smoother textured soup. I used a bit more butter than called for and I used 1/2 1% milk and 1/2 whole milk for a creamier flavor. I also added a shot of tabasco some garlic powder chicken broth granules instead of salt and plenty of fresh cracked pepper. I got to thinking - you could do up a big batch of this without the milk freeze it in 2 cup sized leftover containers then reconstitute with milk later. No more Cambells! The soup tastes very good.",

Okay for the changes I used V8 juice (42oz bottle smallest I could find) so I increased butter and flour to 3T. I sauted the onion and then added the flour and 1 can (14oz) condensed milk (not sweetened). Then I added the juice and brought to a light boil. Then I added 1/2 package (8oz) of cream cheese and wisked till smooth. The soup was great. My husband who doesn't like tomato soup said it was \"munchable\" which is a good thing. Thanks for sharing this easy recipe. I will be making again.",
