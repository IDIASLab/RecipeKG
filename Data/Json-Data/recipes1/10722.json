The sauce had an odd flavor and I didn't think it went with the chicken at all. If I make this again I will not make the sauce the chicken coating is flavorful enough in itself. I will also not fry it on the stovetop again as the chicken turned out really oily (so did the sauce). I think it would be just as good done in the oven as I have a similar recipe that cooks the chicken in the oven at 350 for about 50 minutes.",
