Next time, I would only use 3/4 of the cream cheese mixture so I could get more of the other in.  Also, it doesn't specify (and for those of you like me who may want everything spelled out), do not bake the pie crust first - use an uncooked crust.  One more thing, serve cold - the day after baking is GREAT!!!  WE ALL LOVED IT.",

When I started mixing the cream cheese and other ingredients it was really think.  I've never seen cream cheese be used with out any eggs.  I had also used dark corn syrup rather than light, but it actually turned out pretty good.  A little bit of FYI: the cream cheese comes up to the top so don't be surprised if your pie looks a little puffy.  Also don't put too much syrup into it 'cause it'll overflow and cause a big mess.",

I mean I tried a slice warm and it was not good so I put it in the fridge overnight thinking maybe it would be better cold. Nope There was no sweetness- I mean none. I was expecting a cheesecake type layer topped with pecans and a custard but the cream cheese rose to the top and mixed with everything else and didn't taste anything like a cheesecake. Also the edges of my crust burnt but the bottom stayed soggy- probably due to the cream cheese/custard glob. Real pecan pie and real cheesecake are 10x better.",

The bottom crust didnt cook as well as I would have liked But that was my fault. the cooking time might be a little off I think it needs to cook a little longer. I suggest you use a glass pie pan & pie crust sheets. That way you can judge when your bottom crust is browned. THIS IS A EXCELLENT RECIPE I WILL MAKE A FAMILY TRADITION!!!! tip MAKE MORE THAN ONE.........LOL",

I also didn't follow the recipe exactly. I like how the pecan halves llok so I did not chop them also I poured them into the corn syrup mixture and stirred them up before pouring onto the cream cheese layer. From the top looked like a regular pecan pie but with a delightful surprise on the bottom. My family voted and wants me to only make this pecan pie from now on. Not as sweet as the traditional but defintely good and rich. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",

I used a mrs smith's deep dish frozen pie crust and it filled perfectly to the drop! You need to fill the shell to the VERY TOP since it doesn't rise. I actually set it on the oven rack before pouring in the top layer so I can fill it up and not spill any by having to move it. As long as you use a real deep dish crust you shouldn't have any leftover. The only thing that I had to change was the bake time - it takes almost an hour just don't take it out before it is set! It should be brown and crispy on the top.",
