BUT I don't measure when I cook. I just add stuff so it's possible that I added too much vinegar in the first place. I can't find mustard greens so I add texture with chopped kale and compensate with dijon mustard. Wish I could taste it as Chef John makes it!! Still one of the best potato salads I've ever had and get rave reviews every time I make it.",
