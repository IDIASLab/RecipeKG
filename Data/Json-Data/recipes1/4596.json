Do not leave it unattended on the stove or it might scorch. Also this must be served immediately or it gets very clumpy and hard to spoon out of the pan. I added a little olive oil and kept the heat on low and it helped this a bit. Overall this is a great side dish and a big hit with the family. I will cook it again soon. Thanks!",

Yummy!  I also think that for a really fast, but delicious side dish, I would made the recipe just as written, but instead of fresh basil, I would add a couple TBS of pesto!",
