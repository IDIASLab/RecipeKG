I have made this with low fat ingredients, and it works very well.  Since I have gotten older, I have added chicken and shrimp to the recipe; it is very adaptable.  Easy, tastes wonderful, but not very easy on the waistline.",

I used 4 ounces of bow tie pasta and added a bit over a cup of frozen corn (was finishing off the bag) right before the noodles were finished cooking. While they were draining in the colander I put 1 T leftover garlic butter (light margarine mixed with garlic powder and dried parsley) 1 T leftover white wine and 2 T milk in the pan I'd used to cook the noodles and let that simmer for a minute or so. Stirred in 1 T freshly grated parmesan (I have one of those little zester graters). Stirred the noodles and corn back into the sauce along with a healthy dose of pepper poured it on a plate and grated another tablespoon of parmesan over it. It made quite a large plate of pasta (could someone seriously eat 8 ounces like the recipe says?) and was delicious! Better than plain buttered noodles and quite delicate. I don't think it was too unhealthy either (the light margarine had 5 g fat the parmesan had about 4 then whatever fat was in the noodles and corn). I really liked the corn with it too. I will definitely make this in the future thanks for the idea!",
