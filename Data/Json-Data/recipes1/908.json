It is a little \"gritty/grainy\" because of the ricotta cheese; however it is not as \"gritty\" as a traditional ricotta cheesecake due to the cream cheese and sour cream. I added a 1/2 cup of sugar 1T of vanilla and some crystallized ginger. Therefore it was not even slightly bland. This cake is great to experiment with and since I like to play with my food I will continue to experiment. Overall the cake was great. Light sweet and flavorful...a definite keeper.",

When mixing I used the food processor for all the mixing of ingredients and the texture came out rather creamy and delicious. Also I used an 8inch tray instead of a 10 inch one. This made the cheesecake really deep (SO much batter!) so I left the oven at 150 and cooked an extra 20-30 mins. I served it with chocolate powder sprinkled on top and some single cream. Everyone raved about this cheesecake. The extreme depth went down quite well all round. Even the smallest sliver was still a nice sized piece! I'll make this again.",
