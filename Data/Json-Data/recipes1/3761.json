One echoing a previous reviewer's comments about the \"essentially raw eggs\" the recipe didn't specify how long the eggs actually cooked. For another the recipe seemed to have too much ham in it (and I do like ham). Third the whole thing was too salty for my taste so people may want to use unsalted butter not salt the spaghetti etc. I'll probably make this again with a few minor changes.",
