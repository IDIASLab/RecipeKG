I really wouldn't call Kringla a crisp cookie though - more of a fluffy entity. Also kringla is very common around my hometown and is not considered a holiday treat. It's not unusual to eat kringla once a week or pick it up in the grocery store. Some people have it on hand at all times. Most like to butter their kringla before eating it (buttering is done upside down) and/or put it in the microwave for a few seconds. I like to butter it right after it comes out of the oven - it really soaks up the goodness then.",

I gradually kept adding flour ending up with an entire extra cup of flour in the dough with it still way too sticky to do any kind of rolling with. I scooped them out and they came out very puffy just like the picture but also tasteless like a plain pancake. Not very sweet. I ended up trying multiple things but the best way to cook them was to deep-fry little balls of batter into a puffy donut then I tossed them in cinnamon & sugar. So not exactly the traditional Norwegian cookie I was looking for at all... but no one will complain because the little donuts are good. I'll probably just call them sour cream donuts.",

I make this EXACT recipe every year (for the past 7 years or so). It is a rare recipe to find. It is extremely sticky and a challenge to make. Flour must be on the working surface and sprinkled on top of dough as it is formed into a long roll. (I keep unused dough rolls in fridge for easier working) If you work too much flour into the dough you will make a tough cookie. I try NOT to work too much flour into them and handle them as little as possible. They are very soft and puffy. When these come out of the oven I use a stick of butter and touch it on the hot cookies just enough to melt a little on each one. These don't last very long at my house. My husband says I make them better every year. These freeze well.",
