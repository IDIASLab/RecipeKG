Bring the milk to a boil with 1 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper (left out the food coloring), then whisk in the milk-corn starch slurry.  It will thicken almost immediately.  Let it boil for a minute or so, stirring the whole time, then remove it from the heat and stir in the cheese.  The sauce has a great consistency and is very tasty.  It does have a slight grainy texture, but ANY sauce made with real cheese is like that.  We had it over corkscrew pasta and it was like fancy mac and cheese, would be excellent over broccoli or cauliflower.  My boyfriend thought it tasted like something you'd get at a restaurant.",

This turned out creamy and super yummy for me. I poured it over rotini noodles and it was perfect!!  -i also used up some heavy whipping cream i had left over from alfredo sauce. So what i did was used the rest of my heavy whipping cream with milk (just mixed it all together)",
