I also added sun-dried tomatoes which I feel really added to the taste. I used Pillsbury ready-made dough which made it really easy and made the cornmeal unnecessary. Next time I might add some mushrooms and/or red pepper flakes. So good!",

I made grilled dough so when it was done I placed it on a cookie sheet and topped it w/ the toppings and then baked until done. Oh and I used homemade peasto and I think that makes a huge difference... Great flavors! I made small pizzas and that worked out well. I will def be making this again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)",
