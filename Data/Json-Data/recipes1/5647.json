I do not have a bread machine so I did it by hand using buttermilk instead of regular milk, butter instead of margarine, did not rinse the sauerkraut, and 2 t of active dry yeast which I proofed in the warmed buttermilk.  I didn't end up using the entire 2 1/4 cups of bread flour either.  I did not chop the sauerkraut but left it as is.  I'm not sure what I'll do with this as it is obviously not a toast and jam type of bread but it tastes good!",

The chopped fresh onion will provide plenty of onion flavor. \n\nIf you have gluten on hand, a tablespoon or two will improve the rise and texture. If using all purpose flour instead of bread flour, you'll definitely need to add at least 2 tablespoons of gluten. I'd recommend 3 tablespoons.",
