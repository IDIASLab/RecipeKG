I agree that this is far better, although theirs was good enough to inspire me to find a recipe!\n\nI'm not normally an ingredient snob, but this recipe demands the best ingredients possible.   Grape tomatoes generally have more flavor than typical store bought tomatoes, so that is not an area I would skimp on by using diced tomatoes (or egad! canned!).  It takes a few extra minutes to half those grape tomatoes, but well worth it, in my view. \n\nUse the best olive oil you can find.  I might roll my eyes at that suggestion in another recipe, but for this one, your choice of oil is going to make a difference.  Trader Joe's California olive oil was my choice for this.  It has a strong, fresh, peppery flavor that complements the other ingredients perfectly.  \n\nI suggest you make it exactly as written before changing anything.   The feta cheese suggestion sounds tempting, but this recipe is so well balanced I would hesitate to modify anything.  Perhaps offer it on the side?",
