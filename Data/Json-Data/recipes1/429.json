Immediately I found this recipe and decided to try it for Christmas. I made a double turn following the recipe exactly. I used the butter flavored shortening. These cookies were easy to make and the dough was perfect for my cookie press. They are a melt in the mouth confection. Thanks for a great recipe that I will use over and over.",

I had such a hard time with the first batch that I thought I must have made a mistake but I had the same difficulties with the second batch. First the dough was waaaaay too stiff; it was the consistency of a rolled sugar cookie dough which was too difficult to work with the cookie press. I ended up having to add an extra egg yolk PLUS 2-3 tbsp. of water to the dough to get it loose enough. The first batch tasted very bland so for the second batch I substituted almond extract. That helped a little. Sorry this recipe was more trouble than it was worth.",
