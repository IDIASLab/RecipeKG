I'll review again upon successful completion. I'm sure it will be delicious!:)",

The inclusion of the 2T lemon juice is worth 4 stars all by itself. Genius! My variation; 1 40oz can of Yams no butter a 12 oz can of no-fat evaporated milk instead of milk and whipping cream 1/2 c brown sugar 1/4 c Splenda instead of white sugar 1 T cinnamon 1/2 t mace 1/2 t nutmeg 3/4 t cloves 1 t ginger (or more of any or all of the foregoing to taste the desired outcome is a highly spiced gingerbread flavor). This is far far better than any pumpkin pie although it doesn't have the dense texture for which I was originally looking. Next time I'll double the quantity of yams and add another egg adjusting the sugar lemon juice and spices accordingly aiming for a 2-pie yield. If you prefer a fluffier pie seek no further.",
