I had not tried fava beans before, but now that I am in CA and can get them fresh at the farmers market, I decided to experiment with them.  This risotto is creamy and has bright spring flavors.  The fava beans are a lot of work to shell and then shell again once cooked.  I tasted the cooked shell and it was tasty--I think you may be able to skip the step of shelling the cooked beans.  However, the shelled favas are bright green and pretty, so it would be less attractive.  This seems authentically Italian.  In Italy, they cherish seasonal vegetables, and I am sure that fava bean season is worthy of celebration--this dish is a showcase for the delicate sweetness of the beans.",

Also according to the kind folks at Cooks Illustrated you don't have to: 1) heat the chicken stock before adding it and 2) add little bits at a time. So I skipped both of those steps and dumped the stock in at once stirring periodically. No gluey risotto here! I also subbed Madiera (since I had it onhand) for the white wine and it was SPECTACULAR. Warning tho unless you'd like this to be a main dish (vs. a side) it makes a LOT of risotto. I'm going to freeze my leftovers and see how that goes.",

I lamented that I've never been able to get fava beans at home but no sooner did I return home did I happily stumble upon them in my market! I was eager to use them in this recipe. Because I cooked the risotto long and slow over 40 minutes and using 5 cups of chicken broth it turned out beautifully allowing the rice to release all its starch and resulting in a wonderfully creamy risotto. Unfortunately while the quality of the finished dish couldn't be beat it tasted of nothing more than the broth it was cooked in. Therefore it was only average. As for the fava beans they were only discernible by sight - there weren't enough of them to really make an impact in taste. Lots of effort for a risotto without distinction.",
