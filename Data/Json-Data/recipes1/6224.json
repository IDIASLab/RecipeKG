                "reviewBody": "I live in Mississippi and know how true southern cooks make cornbread. Nobody I know uses plain cornmeal and all-purpose flour when SELF-RISING Cornmeal MIX is on the shelf ready for the skillet in minutes. Every brand I've seen has a recipe for Buttermilk Cornbread on the side of the bag that is very close to how everyone makes it. Jason is correct: nobody adds sugar to cornbread. Leave it out. I've never heard of a whole cup of butter or margarine added before baking. That's 2 sticks people, and this is not supposed to be cake. 4 cups of buttermilk is way, way too much. Last of all, it's OK to use corn or other veggie oil, especially if you are vegetarian or have health issues that would preclude using pork drippings.   So here's my recipe:  2 cups self-rising cornmeal mix 1 1/2 to 2 cups buttermilk 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 2 eggs, lightly beaten 1/4 cup bacon drippings  Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Add bacon drippings to a well-seasoned 9-inch cast iron skillet and place in oven while it preheats. Combine eggs and buttermilk in a medium size mixing bowl, add the cornmeal mix and blend thoroughly. Remove the hot skillet from the oven, pour the hot drippings into the cornbread batter, then stir to quickly incorporate it. Pour the mix back into the skillet, and bake 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown.  Slather on all the butter you want and eat it while it's hot. You won't stop with one slice.",

                "reviewBody": "If you're looking for a really good cornbread recipe don't overlook this one. Half the recipe bakes beautifully in a 10\" skillet. I confess I did add 2 tablespoons of sugar to half the recipe (my personal preference) substituted unsalted butter for the margarine and doubled the salt. Also important to stir wet ingredients into dry only until moistened. A somewhat lumpy consistency is okay. Don't overmix if you want the bread to be tender. A well-seasoned cast iron skillet is a must for this recipe. Preheat as directed and use a generous amount of oil to prevent sticking -- enough to have a slight puddle in the bottom before the batter is poured in. Also helps to sprinkle some cornmeal over the oil. The batter should sizzle and sort of \"fry\" when poured in. This recipe is very moist tender and flavorful when properly prepared. Perfect with purple hull peas turnip greens and other traditional southern favorites. Thanks Jason.",

As most southern cooks know a well seasoned cast iron skillet is a requirement and bacon grease is a must. Also we heat our skillets in a preheated oven instead of on top of the stove. I always use self-rising flour and pour a bit of the heated grease into the mixture. The only time I have used margarine is for buttering the top of the bread after it comes out of the oven.
