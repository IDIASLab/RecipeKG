When you follow the recipe exactly the bar are literally like wet sand! Crumbly is not descriptive enough to say what happens to them. I put them in a container and the container looked like it had brown sugar in it not bars. It is a good base for a recipe though here is how to fix it and not have the recipe be bland (the original has no peanut butter in the actual bar) Use 1 cup brown sugar AND one cup regular sugar. Add the 1/2 cup peanut butter to the dough after creaming the shortening and sugar. Then add TWO eggs. Just one doesn't do it. Then follow everything else just like it says. With the few changes made these bars are fantastic! Hubby gave the original recipe a 5. (I had added extra sugar and peanut butter but followed everything else.) He gave the modified version a 10! This recipe is a good base make a few minor changes like I said and it really is spectactular!",
