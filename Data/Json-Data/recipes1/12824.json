The zucchini I use is about 12 inches long, the size makes a big difference on the amount of stuffing you have. I just started using Morningstar Farms Burger style Grillers Veggie Recipe Crumbles (in a bag)in place of the sausage. Excellant! Also, even easier to throw everyting in a bowl, mix it and then stuff the zucchini. I cut out most of the salt too. Just sprinkled Season All on the squash before adding stuffing. Hope you enjoy!",

That being said I changed it so much I'm not even sure it's the same recipe but it inspired me!  Here's what I did and it was amazing: browned 1 lb sausage in a pan and set aside.  Sauteed half a red onion with 2 tsp italian seasonings and a shake of garlic salt.  When they were almost cooked I chopped up the inside of the zucchini that I scraped out and sauteed until soft.  I added about a cup of precooked brown wild rice, the sausage and about 1/2 cup chopped fresh cherry toms and cooked until heated.  I stirred in 1 cup shredded cheddar and filled the zucchini boats.  Then I grated parmesan on top and baked.  We had extra filling that I saved to use in omelets or something like that.",

Needless to say there was no need to remove the seeds after cooling...the microwave took care of that when the end exploded off. Bit of a mess but next time I will pierce the vegetable even if it doesn't tell me to. Live and learn.",
