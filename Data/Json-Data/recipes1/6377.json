I don't claim to be escarole savy but I certainly cooked it long enough. If anyone out there has any suggestions I would certainly appreciate it because we honestly couldn't even finish it. Again the flavors were great Tammy and I'll give this another try if I can find a way to tenderize the leaves.",

Did not think the lemon was too much, as mentioned by some reviewers but we did use Meyer lemons from our tree which are a milder flavor so maybe that is why. I did not see that the recipe required 2 heads of escarole so I only purchased one, then wound up tossing in  baby arugula after the salad was removed from the heat to make up for the missing escarole. I think I may almost prefer it this way in the event I prepare this again. All at our dinner party loved it but we are bitter greens lovers. The capers were especially nice! We served this as a salad/side dish with a polenta &  braised short ribs - perfect to cut the creaminess & fattiness of the other items served.",
