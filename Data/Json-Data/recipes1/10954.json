I also used milk instead of water, and added dashes of worchestershire, celery salt, garlic powder and onion powder, and a bit of salt and pepper. I covered the casserole for the first 40 minutes, then I uncovered it for another 15. At that point I topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and baked for about 5 more minutes. Nest time I think i'll add some finely chopped onions. I think this is a good basic recipe, with your own flavorful additions it'll turn out fantastic!",

I'll definately make it again.\r\nI actually used more potatoes, and 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup along with about 3/4 can water of each. I used healthy request soup. \r\nI sprinkled salt, pepper, and onion powder over the potatoes and carrots. I didn't use mushrooms as I didn't have any on hand. \r\nI couldn't help thinking there was something missing so I added about a cup of the \"French's\" Durkee Fried Onions (the kind you put in green bean casserole), and I really think it made all the difference.\r\nI cooked it for about 2 hours uncovered.\r\n\r\nI'll will most certainly make this again.
