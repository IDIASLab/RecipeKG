I thought the sauce was too runny when I poured it in the pan, but as the others said, it really thickens up when in the oven. My 2 year old loves it as do we.  We accompanied it with steamed broccoli for a little healthy upswing.",

Baked one and stored the other un-baked one in the fridge to be put in the oven 1/2 hour before dinner the next day. Do not worry that the sauce seems runny when you add it to the noodles.
