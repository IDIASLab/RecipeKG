This was my mom's favorite cake--often making an appearance at family events--but the recipe disappeared when she died 25 years ago. My sisters and I were determined to find a reasonable facsimile--but this is the REAL DEAL. The cake itself is fine-textured moist and oh-so-flavorful. My family isn't keen on frosting so I served it faintly warm with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream and a homemade hot fudge sauce (Try one of those featured on this site.) Pretty fine! Could the dryness reported by one reviewer be the result of using the wrong flour-measuring technique? Be sure to spoon the cake flour into the cup and level off. Any other technique will give you too much flour and result in a dry cake. Overbaking will do the same thing of course. Wish I could give this 4 1/2 stars.",

Instead of the food coloring I used the cherry juice and some very finely diced marashino cherries. It gave the frosting a very nice pink tint and the little chunks of cherry gave the frosting a little variety in texture. I also made this recipe into cupcakes and you do have to be careful not to overbake it. It can dry out. All in all this is as close to my grandmothers recipe that I have found.",
