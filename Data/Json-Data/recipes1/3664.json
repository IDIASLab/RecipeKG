I really hate when people make all types of adjustments then rate a recipe low...what are you really rating then!?!? Anyway I did not have celery and I used fresh baby carrots instead of frozen other than that I followed everything else exact on the ingredients list. The \"drop in\" noodles are more like dumplings so I made mine much bigger than pea-size to represent more of a dumpling than a noodle. I also cooked the dumplings in some broth I stole from the slow cooker and boiled instead of in boiling then dumpped it all back in the slow cooker. I think it gave a bit more flavor to the \"noodles\" a.k.a dumplings. Over all I though this was pretty good and would definitly use it again.",

The dogs ate the rest of the noodles and I will add some boxed pasta to the soup. If salt if the taste you want then this is the recipe for you.

Just cut long strips let dry and wallah! you have homemade pasta for the next time. This recipe is just lovely its comforting and home-y. The taste is heavenly simple flavors for comfort and not what I would call bland besides you can always punch it up a bit for different tastes.",
