The consistency was perfect and it was a beautiful color.  The taste was light and not too sweet with lots of blackberry flavor.  We used an applesauce 'grinder' to get the seeds out of the blackberries and it worked well.  Worth the work, thanks for the great recipe, we will be making this again.",

I used frozen raspberries and added a tablespoon of lemon juice when I cooked them on the stove. I also poured the filling into a regular pie crust since that is what I like. A bit time consuming and I had to dirty about every dish I own but well worth it! Loved it. Very pretty pink color and flavor is excellent. Only thing is I had too much filling left over so next time I'm going to use only 2 eggs.",
