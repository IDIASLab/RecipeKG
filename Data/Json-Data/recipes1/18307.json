I made it as written to include the Duncan Hines Yellow Cake Mix. Unfortunately my family did not love the cake. My husband and oldest said the cake reminded them of a cake you would have in an Army chow hall. It wasn't bad but not their favorites.  I may have spoiled them with my homemade cakes. I will continue looking for a Cheerwine cake they love.",
