A head is the entire bulb containing 8 or more cloves. The recipe actuallly calls for about 16 cloves! Just peel and leave them whole. It is the crushing and chopping that releases the intense garlic flavour. Uncut garlic has a sweeter gentler taste and 16 really isn't too much.",

Taking heed to the warnings about blandness I used 4 heads of garlic - enough to keep most people from bothering me for a week - I chopped 20 cloves and put the other 20 in whole. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I live alone and this recipe fed me for 2 weeks. It didn't spoil I never got tired of it and best of all the longer it sat in the fridge the more the garlic seeped into the beef. I'm just finishing up the last of it and it's the best of the batch! I put it over bow-tie pasta with a little salt - this is just GREAT! Will definitely make this again!",

I think the problem is that the only flavor that came through was garlic and honestly the texture of the beef wasn't to our liking. More like pot roast than I was expecting. I couldn't tell if it was trying to be Italian or not but I thought sour cream would be good on it so I added a dollop after a few bite fulls. That was better. Still not something I'd make again \"as is\" (nothing to write home about) but a good jumping point for something. Thanks for this recipe I appreciate it!",

I used the amount of olive oil indicated and then let it sit overnight in the frig and pulled out the grease and oil that gathered on the top layer. I used elephant garlic so I only needed 3 of the giant cloves but I cut them up because I wanted a super garlicy meat. I served this over yellow and white rice for color and garnished with chives.
