(i've never put the chocolate finish on them) PANCAKE SYRUP(my preferrence) is an excellent substitute for the corn syrup, since it's essentially maple flavored corn syrup.  It is the best no-bake cookies I have tried--but I had to shorten the boil time. I shortened the boil time to 30-35 seconds--if they get too hard, you boiled it too long.  You can try most any cereal and I also suggest adding more cereal like others have said---but they are good really gooey too just as is! I am asked for this recipe repeatedly. Having your peanut butter measured and ready before you start is key!",

It's an easier alternative to Rice Krispie treats and they taste better too. I left off the chocolate etc. Not needed. I made these as a girl when I was in 4-H and I'm thrilled to have the recipe again. Take my advice- don't let the corn syrup mixture boil too long. If you do they get hard. I let it boil for about 30 seconds at the most. I measure the peanut butter before I turn on the stove so that the corn syrup doesn't over boil. Make this recipe. You will love it.",
