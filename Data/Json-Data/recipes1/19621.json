To make it 5-star, for my family and I, I ditched the cornmeal, subbed buttermilk for the regular milk and doubled it, and used a LOT more cayenne (bringing it closer to the recipe I've always used).  Follow the actual process of preparing the tomatoes and cooking them.  These steps are very important and Chef John has laid them out very well.  When finished, I used my own remoulade recipe (relish, mayo, lemon juice, hot sauce, cayenne, paprika, s&p, blended smooth), and stacked my tomatoes with crab cakes, with the remoulade (mixed with tiny salad shrimp) over all.  DELISH!!!!",

Follow Chef John's advice and you will be a Southerner in no time. I used Italian panko bread crumbs and added one additional egg white to the two whole eggs and milk station. Please make sure you let them set for 10 to 15 minutes once breaded as I believe it makes all the difference. Also make sure to follow the step regarding drawing out the water from the tomato slices. The remoulade sauce puts this dish over the top. Liked the movie loved the dish.",
