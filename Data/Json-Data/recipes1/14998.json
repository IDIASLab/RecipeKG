Next time I will use way less sugar and see how that goes. I might even cut it down to 2 cups. The fudge was far too sweet. I'll update this with the results next time I make it. I have decreased sugar in other fudge recipes with positive results so I doubt this will be a problem. Also some of the sugar still seemed to be crystallized although the fudge set perfectly. Anyone know what causes this?",

Get a digital thermometer and get it to a minimum temp of 234, max 240. Then just take it off the heat and follow the rest of the directions. This will give you that creamy not grainy smooth fudge.",

It is very similar to the PB fudge my dad used to fix. I wonder if using regular PB instead of reduced fat would make it even more peanut buttery. I've tried the Aunt Teen's choc fudge 3 times and came up with a hard crumbly mess each time so I'm glad to see that this came out great. I suspect it may have something to do with adding the marshmallow creme AFTER boiling the mixture.",
