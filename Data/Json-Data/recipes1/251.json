I also substituted the almond extract with vanilla extract since I didn't have any almond extract on hand.  I baked the cookies for exactly 10 minutes and pulled them out of the oven when just some of the edges were golden brown.  I will definitely make these again.  Update:  I made this recipe again with all butter, no shortening.  The cookies spread quite a bit and weren't nearly as good as when I made them with 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter.  ",

Half of them said the cookies came out really cakey and puffy, and the other half said they were too flat. I don't like either extremes and really wanted a cookie that was right in the middle. I got it! I followed the recipe in the basics (was going to use less flour as some of the reviews stated, but when I was adding it, they looked like they needed all 2 1/2 cups), except did 1 tsp vanilla instead of half almond, and added more macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips. Used real salted butter, and it wasn't extremely softened, which I think helped. Dropped by tablespoons instead of teaspoons because teaspoons always seem too small. Baked for 9 minutes and they came out just undercooked in the middle, which is exactly how I like them. They were perfect. Hope this helps!",

Almond is a very strong flavor and macadamia nuts are expensive. I did not want to overpower their delicate flavor.A++++",

Crispy crust and chewy insides.\n\nIf your having issues with the cookies I'd recommend you check your technique, you must be doing something wrong.\n\nI'd recommend doing it all by hand, electric mixers can cause things to go wrong very quickly because the generate heat and can over mix your batter.\n\nIf your cookies are running flat, it means your butter is melting before you bake. First check and be sure your using real butter, the only ingredients in it should be milk/cream, anything else and it's not butter! Your butter is ready for creaming when it's cool to the touch and when you press your finger against it, it should dent a little. Also when you pick it up it should have no trouble holding it's shape. When your creaming try not to place your hand by the bottom of the bowl, the heat from your hand can melt the butter to much. Also chilling your cookies just before baking can help it keeps it shape, but don't chill for to long, maybe a few mins. Baking soda goes to work immediately, so if you wait to long your cookies won't rise.\n\nIf it's coming out cakey it's probably the shortening or too much baking soda (measure carefully!!!!) Hard/dense cookies are do to over mixing, to get that crisp and chewy texture you want to FOLD your dry ingredients in GENTLY a little at a time.  Stirring or being aggressive will beat the gluten to much and change the texture of the cookie.",

First I made sure to allow the butter to soften on its own at room temperature and substituted 1/2 of the butter with butter Crisco. I also only used 1/2 of the almaond extract that is called for. The results were absolutely fabulous!!! They had very nice form and baked up perfectly on my stoneware cookie sheet. My husband labeled it \"a keeper\" and took some to work to \"share\" although I think he was selfish and kept most for himself. I will be making these again!!",
