I added a little more oil, a 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and substituted brown sugar for the white.  I also sprinkled the tops with sugar after they came out of the oven.  I think the best thing I did, though, was to stew dried cranberries in orange juice before adding them.  That helped sweeten the cranberries and gave more  orange flavor to the muffins.\nThe only problem I had was the muffins didn't raise very well (possibly due to the heaviness of the stewed cranberries).  Next time I'll try adding an extra tsp. of baking powder.",

I took the advice of a few reviewers ~ put some sugar on the top of the muffins the last 5 minutes of baking.  Added a 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips and made 6 large muffins instead of 12 of the smaller muffins.  The consistency of the muffins is GREAT!  The taste is wonderful.  I'm a big cranberry fan so this was a hit for me.  The kids weren't real fond of the tartness of the cranberry, but they still ate it. *probably because of the chocolate chips  ;-)*  Next time I make these muffins I will double or triple the recipe and freeze some of them.  One last thing, I did chop the cranberries with just a knife but will use my food processor next time.",

I used 1 cup (dried, soaked, chopped) cranberries + 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. So basically this was a great jumping off recipe for me!  ;-)",
