                "reviewBody": "Great cookies! I have been using this recipe for years - but there are a few tricks!!! Cream butter sugar add vanilla then milk. Stir well add cherries and pecans (don t stir until you add the dry ingredients)) Mix dry ingredients in another bowl then add a bit at a time to the wet mixture while you stir. Once you add the last bit - knead the dough with your hands. If the dough doesn't stick well add a tiny bit of milk at a time until you get a good form. Break balls in half and roll into 3 inch logs then roll the logs into the coconut (if you want a better coating of coconut brush the outside of the dough logs lightly with milk before rolling). You can freeze this for a couple of hours - then slice and cook but it's best sitting in the fridge over night. The tip to not get the coconut to burn is to slice the cookies very thinly (approx 1/4 inch) and either line your cookie pans with silicon sheets or parchment paper. Keep an eye on the first batch until you know the desired time! Recipe says 375F I say 350F! Check them at 10 minutes then add a couple of minutes to that (if needed). You want the bottoms golden not dark - and the cookie should still be a little moist Leave them on the pan until they cool (they will finish cooking this way)",

I always use real butter and freeze the logs overnight or longer before baking for easier slicing. I also substitute chopped maraschino cherries (drained on paper towels) for the candied ones. I may try cranberries one reviewer used. The BEST part of the cookie for my family is the FINAL STEP I added. After cooling drizzle dark chocolate in one direction over the cookies and then white chocolate in another direction. It adds a lot to the taste and makes the cookies beautiful!",

I was worried they would be too sweet but the combination between the candied cherries coconut and cookie was very nice. I will definately make these again!",
