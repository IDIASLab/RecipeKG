There are many whole wheat recipes that use half white flour.\nConcession I made: I only used the 1 c.brown sugar, eliminated the other sugar.\nBecause I like to make my bread in a KitchenAid Mixer, I put half of each of the flours and all the rest of the ingredients in the mixer bowl. When that was well mixed, I poured the batter into a measuring cup, and then returned half of that to the mixer. I then added half of the balance of each of the remaining flours.  This gave me more managable pieces of dough to work with. I added an extra 5 minutes or 50 turns of kneading by hand to each piece, then kneaded the two pieces together to rise.\nThis bread makes wonderful toast, a great sandwich or just plain with butter.  My husband raves about the bread everytime he has a slice. Thanks for a great recipe. It deserves more than 5 stars.",

I have been able to replace the white flour with 50/50 flour making the bread 3/4 whole wheat without sacrificing moisture or texture. It is best if you add the boiling water to the whole wheat and give it about 20 minutes to soak it up, that way you won't knead more flour into it than you need!",

Try making it into 2 loaves some breadsticks and some wheat rolls from the dough. Then freeze! I will make a few changes to my next batch. I will decrease liquid by 3TB and replace the brown sugar with honey (you need to decrease liquid when subbing in honey). I will add some vital wheat gluten for a chewier texture. As is this bread is very crumbly/lots of crumbs. So if that is what you prfer don't add gluten! Also I prefer all whole wheat so I will not add any white flour next time. This is wonderful recipe as is or with a few minor changes! Thanks for the submission--this one will be used weekly by me!!!",

The term whole wheat is a modifier on the bread just like rye is to rye bread even though it's not made with all rye flour. Most whole wheat breads you'll find in stores aren't 100% either.",
