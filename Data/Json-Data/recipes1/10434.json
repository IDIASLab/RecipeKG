I removed the casings from the sausage and instead of chopping them into pieces, I mixed the sausage with the ground beef.  I used a 28 oz. can of sauce, and a 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes.  The onions do add some sweetness to the sauce, so keep that in mind when deciding how much to add.  I used one half of a large yellow onion, and it wasn't too sweet.  I also added some cayenne pepper to the sauce, and some parsley.  This is a great beginner recipe!  Next time I will try it with ground pork.",

Gave the sauce a lick and decided it needed a little oomph so I added 1/4 tsp. allspice and 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes. Served over penne with mozzarella and parsley and buon appetito!",
