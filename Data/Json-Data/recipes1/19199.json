It did come out a bit soupy because I think I used too much Velveeta, but it was still yummy, and I will definitely make it again.",

Then instead of using a packet of taco seasoning, I added cumin, paprika, chilli powder, garlic powder, black pepper and red pepper flakes to taste. This mixture of spices has no salt, as the cheese has plenty. Next time I think I will also half the cheese. I agree with the suggestion to use flour tortillas.",

I saut\u00e9ed an onion with the ground beef. I added a ton of chili powder, cilantro, and cumin, and red pepper flakes for more heat. Also, 1 can of Rotel is laughable unless you want only a minimal amount of tomatoes per layer. Without any of the spices, it\u2019s pretty much cheeseburger corn tortilla bake.",
