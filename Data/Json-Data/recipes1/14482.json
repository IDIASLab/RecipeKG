It's easy.. just cut the tops off of five or six bulbs of garlic wrap in foil and bake in the oven for 45 minutes or so until they're mushy. Then squeeze out all the garlicky goodness and mix with salt if desired. It's amazingly good and the garlic isn't hot after being roasted. I wonder if this part was missing from the recipe? I can't imagine eating 3 cups of raw garlic. Yikes! Anyway try it that way and it might be much tastier.:-)",

Cut back the salt to taste or perhaps a teaspoon, drizzle the oil over the cloves just enough so that the blender does not stall. I also use the small baby food blender cups, and make this in batches so the salt and oil is very limited; sometimes I add a tablespoon of lemon juice to the mix rather than more oil. I have been roasting garlic for about 10 years now and love it. I use it on baked potatoes, hot pasta, mixed with a little butter to make garlic toast or brushed on brushetta before adding the topping. It is wonderful on sandwiches in place of butter or mayo. I have been known to add 1/2 a teaspoon of red chili flakes before pureeing the cloves. Please, try roasting it first, you will really like it and it's versatility!",
