I roll out long (2 1/2 foot) lengths of each color then cut to the size I want.  Do not use too much flour to do this or the colors will not stick together when you roll them together and twist.  Use just enough to keep it from sticking to you or the counter.  If you have trouble rolling them or they break easily when removed from the pan, make smaller ones.  You decide the length when you cut them.  After reading some later comments on these cookies, I felt a need to comment on eggs and butter.  Whenever you bake the size of egg you use can make a BIG difference as well as butter vs margarine.  Margarine has water in it which alters the recipe.  Eggs, I generally use extra large (Costco eggs).",

First, if you are having problems with the cookies breaking, use regular white sugar instead of the confectioners' in the recipe.  It still yields a delicious delicate cookie, but the regular sugar makes a cookie just slightly chewy and alot stronger.  I have never had them fall apart after doing this.  Secondly, we never coat them in crushed candy canes.  I don't feel that peppermint and almond extract really go together. We instead coat our candy canes with confectioners' sugar before serving.  It just adds a little something extra and gives a nice presentation.  Enjoy!",

Also after giving the two ropes a twist I gave 'em another roll so they were a single stripped stick and came out more like a candy cane. You can also substitute the almond extra with peppermint as many people aren't expecting them to be almond flavored.",

I agree the size of egg AND shortening make a HUGE difference in how the dough comes out. The dough tends to be a bit on the dry side -- use extra large or large eggs and the dough will be easier work and shouldn't crack so much. I moved to Ohio 10 years ago and mom has tried shipping them to me (they don't withstand the postal service too well) a few years back she just started rolling the dough out and cutting it like a sugar cookie -- they are much more durable and still taste GREAT!",
