I'm sorry but I've had much better. The sugar concentrated in the bottom and the butter seperated turning the whole thing ended up a mess. I prefer a corn pudding that has more corn to it and is less of a sweet omelet with corn in it. I'll go back to my other recipe next time. I thought this one would be so easy but I was dead wrong.",
