Start with a VERY light sprinkle of garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Evenly spread fresh basil, coarsely chopped.  I grated fresh Parmesan directly onto the salmon and then again on top of Roma tomato slices.  Another light sprinkle of salt and any leftover basil before a drizzle of olive oil.  I let the salmon sit for about 30 to 45 minutes to allow it to soak up the flavors before baking it for 15 mins., followed by about 2 to 4 mins. under the broiler.  I also think it should be served with a lemon wedge, it seemed to need a bit more citrus than what the tomatoes alone provide.  Served with couscous and a salad of mixed greens.",

I love parmesan cheese and it melted nicely on top of the salmon. A nice combination of fresh flavors! Everything just melted in my mouth and I was in heaven! This is perfect for a late summer dinner - especially here in Hawaii!
