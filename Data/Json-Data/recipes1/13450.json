Just test it with a toothpick. I always start the timer at the lowest suggested baking time. That way I don't have burned stuff. Also, make sure you have an oven thermometer.

I made no changes to the recipe other than using an 8x4\u201d loaf pan and after preparing it and tasting it (well, to be honest eating a good-sized slice) I can confidently report no changes are necessary \u2013 nothing added, nothing substituted, nothing omitted.  You could change this or that if for some reason you felt compelled to, but it wouldn\u2019t make this any better.  It\u2019s a pretty loaf, first of all; very inviting.  Some baked goods taste better than they look, but this is good from the get-go, and you\u2019d be proud to serve it to \u201ccompany.\u201d   The bread is at once moist, cinnamon-y with a delightfully sugary, crackly top.  It's incredibly flavorful, even tho\u2019 there are no flavor enhancers (other than salt) like vanilla, brown sugar or butter.  None are needed, nor would they improve the structure or taste in any way.  With common pantry staples you are likely to always have on hand, this is one of those recipes you can just get into the kitchen and dig into without sorting through a ton of reviews while making notes of advised tweaks and changes.  Mix this up simply following the recipe as it\u2019s written and enjoy.",

When I make it again, I think I'll cut back the sugar just a little since that added quite a bit of sweetness.  Also, I need to cook it a little longer, as it was quite doughy in the middle but a little experimenting with my oven should fix that!  I didn't wrap it and let it sit overnight, though I know that this does improve quick breads.  Thanks for a great recipe with ingredients most have on hand!  One more thing...the three star rating given by a previous poster can't really be considered accurate as baking soda and baking powder are two VERY different things and interchanging them would greatly alter a recipe.",

I also added 1/4 cp chopped peanuts to the cinnamon sugar mixture. It turned out better yet! So the original recipe is an excellent basic one to which you can make your own changes.
