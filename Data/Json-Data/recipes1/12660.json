My husband who is not a major sweet freak tried one and fell in love because aside from the confectioners' sugar on the outside these are not super sweet cookies. They are just right.

For those that aren't happy with this recipe please note: This is what you call a butter cookie..it has no eggs. The flavor mellows while stored yes for 2 or 3 weeks. The trick to this is use a foil lined tin with a tin top NOT plastic. Seperate layers with wax paper NOT plastic wrap set aside on a shelf where your family won't start taste testing! (Not the refrigerator) You will be amazed with the results. This is a wonderful cookie to make at Christmas because it is best made ahead when you aren't quite as busy. They were excellent & almost dissolve in your mouth as a very tastey buttery treat.. My coffee gang devoured them. I gave them only 4 stars only because I think the recipe needed an explanation about serving true butter cookies.",
