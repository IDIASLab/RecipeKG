I rinse & check the beans for foreign matter, takes less than a minute.  Then I cover the beans with water so that it's 2 inches over the beans.  Bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer & cover.  Takes about 2 1/2 hours to cook pintos, maybe half an hour less for navy beans.  I never ever bothered with the soaking or boiling for 2 minutes and waiting an hour or any of that unnecessary stuff.  (However, if you have gas problems from eating beans, it might help if you do that, as described by BugsNRoo.) And if you can't be bothered with or plain old just don't have time to cook dried beans, then just open some canned ones, rinse and drain them and stop whining.  Wanda, you have been treated poorly!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!  ",

Although I'm sure most home cooks know to do a soak! I did a quick soak first where I covered the beans in water brought to a boil took off the heat and let them sit covered for an hour. Then I drained the water and rinsed them and started cooking. I used ham hocks which helped flavor the soup but I probably had much less ham in my soup than called for. That was my only change to the recipe. My husband loved the soup! I thought the sour cream gave it a nice creamy texture and it felt good eating it on a cold day. It was simple and it didn't take a lot of time to make. I will be making this soup again in the future!",

I followed the directions on the bag of beans for sorting, rinsing, quick soak, and cooking.  30 minutes before beans finished cooking, I added the spice packet that came with bag and also 1 lb of cooked ham, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 chopped onion, 4 cloves minced garlic (because we love garlic, otherwise 1 clove), and 1 cup sour cream.  I liked how the sour cream idea from this recipe added a little more rich flavor instead of just a water only based soup. Maybe next time will try with the cream corn too.",

It looks innocently simple but working with dried beans I think is just a pain. Beans will NOT cook by boiling and simmering for an hour or two. I have to boil them soak them overnight and then simmer them for quite some time the next day. My mother had to do this my brother too. Are we the only three people who can't make dried beans ready in 2-3 hours? Or does everyone else just like hard beans? I know what boil and simmer mean and this just doesn't work. And they'll never get by on 6 cups of water. I don't know how much I added but I lost count at about 11-12 cups. When the beans were about 3/4 done I drained them and just covered in water added the flavor packet and the ham itself to help add flavor. And then added water as needed to get a thickish soup that still had flavor. It was pretty good once it was done which was a full day. (That doesn't include the time going through the beans which I always do since I have found rocks in them.) I had doubts about the sour cream but think it just made it better. But I won't be making again any time soon. There's plenty of easier bean soups out there.",
