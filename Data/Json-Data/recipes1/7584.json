I dripped a chocolate glaze over it  and it tasted great.  I will make it again but I might experiment with adding more butter for a more  tender cake.  Though the glaze went really good with this, I'm thinking that the firm texture may not go well with frosting.  This recipe really came through for me as I racked my resources looking for a cake that was fast, easy and didn't eatup all my groceries.  Thank You.",

Plus I don't like adding tons of butter so the recipe was really friendly to me. It has the taste of ladyfingers. I noticed it had a nice firm texture so I thought it would hold up great in milk. I drenched the cooked cake in normal milk and it tastes just like a tres leches cake. The cake was a bit sweet but adding the milk made the sweetness just right. I will use this as my base cake when I am in the mood for tres leches.",
