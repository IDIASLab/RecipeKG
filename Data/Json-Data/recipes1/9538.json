I cut the recipe in half and decreased the amount of potatoes and increased the amount of eggs. Instead of boiling the potatoes I pan fried them with a bit of butter garlic and onion to give them some crispiness and flavor. I scrambled my eggs with a bit of milk to get them nice and fluffy. When assembling these I added some shredded cheese and half with sausage the other half with bacon. Perfect with a side of OJ!",

I tore some precooked bacon into pieces microwaved the potatoes until almost done then added some onion powder to the potatoes and a homemade season all blend and cooked it all in the skillet until the potatoes were browned and the bacon was crispy. I added the scrambled eggs to one side of the pan cooked til they were done and mixed the whole thing together. I skipped the veg spray and used a bit of veg oil instead. The potatoes need a little seasoning or they will be too bland and are much more flavorful cooked with the bacon and the season all. With seasoning and a little know how you can end up with an excellent end product but done exactly as written it's seriously lacking flavor and too potatoey.",
