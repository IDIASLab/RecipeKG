I cut the recipe in half and put it in the crockpot all day.  I was going to sear the meat first, but I didn't have time.  Instead of a green chile, I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I added a small can of tomato sauce because it seemed too thick at first, but at the end it was almost too thin- I left the lid off the crockpot for a while so it would thicken up.  I added 1/2 green bell pepper and used one can of pinto beans.  Served with light sour cream, cheese, and Honey Corn Bread from this site.  A hearty, very filling meal!",
