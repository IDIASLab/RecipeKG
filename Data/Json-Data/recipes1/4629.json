After reading the reviews I too used orange extract instead of orange zest but it didn't give them a very strong orange flavor--next time I think I'll try using both and see what happens. Also I tried the trick of flouring my white chocolate chips but the flour didn't really want to stick to them so it didn't help much and most of them sank to the bottom. I think next time I will chop them up smaller. Also the frosting you choose can make or break this recipe. I chose a favorite white chocolate cream cheese frosting and added a little orange extract and it was great!",
