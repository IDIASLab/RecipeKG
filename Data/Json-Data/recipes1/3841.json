One cup is barely enough to turn the one and a half eggs into a batter much less a dough. I actually believe that this must be a typo and that you need to use 2 cups. After adding an extra cup of flour this recipe became a kneadable dough and came out exactly as I would expect biscotti to come out as a firm dense cookie and not-too-sweet taste. If I could I'd mark four stars for taste one star for inaccuracy.",

I have also drizzled the chocolate over one side to give it a \"professional\" look like the ones in the stores. Everytime I make these they go fast.
