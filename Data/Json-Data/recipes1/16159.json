I'm 74 years old, do it all the time, as did my Mother years ago.  Works great...saves time, space, etc.  You can oil the potatoes before putting in the foil if you wish.",

However, I have never tried this recipe, until this past weekend.  And now I am a believer!  I HATE baking potatoes.  They just never come out perfect, so I always end up buying the ones you do in the microwave that are wrapped in plastic.  Not anymore...I loved these!  I scrubbed, let dry, and then rubbed w/ olive oil and kosher salt.  I did not wrap in foil, but they turned out fine.  Cooked on High for 4 1/2 hours then removed the lid and let them cool for a bit, and they were perfect.  Mine weren't \"soggy\" like some reviewers mentioned, but it might have been b/c I didn't wrap in foil.  Not sure, but I will make my potatoes like this many more times!  Thanks!!!",
