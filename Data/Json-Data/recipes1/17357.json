It only yields two small glasses or one tall glass so increase the recipe as necessary if you're making for a crowd. I blended the ice and mango until smooth then added almond milk (I thought I had coconut but didn't- oh well!) and poured into two glasses. I spooned half of the tapioca into each glass and stirred. If unique texture isn't your thing try putting the mixture in the refrigerator for 10 mins. The tapioca pearls froze which I actually preferred. I found one small glass to be plenty for this type of drink. Enjoy!",
