Although this recipe was not an exact replica, it was sure the best bread I have had since I have been in the United States. I would recommend that a dish with water be placed in the oven before and during the baking process. This extends the cooking time by 10-15 mins, but gives a soft yet dry finish,which is hard to find in any other bread.",

I guess that is how it is supposed to be...anyway we liked it alot! I hope my pic does it justice like I said I have never had or seen this type of bread. We just followed the recipe and it produced a nice simple white loaf of bread! Thanks for the post we enjoyed!",
