A few changes: I chopped the raw spinach and sauteed it with the onions, mushrooms, and garlic until onions were tender-crisp.  I was skeptical about using a whole onion, but it really provided extra flavor and texture. Also, I omitted the parmesan (which appears in the directions but not in the ingredient list) and just sprinkled extra romano on the last layer.  I wasn't sure where I was supposed to end up with the layering process, so after the romano, I topped it off with a layer of noodles, my last bit of sauce, and a good sprinkling of mozzarella cheese. For the sake of evennness throughout, next time I will alter the layering portions to 2c filling (three inside layers), 3/4c cheese (three inside layers plus top), and just over 3/4c sauce (three inside layers plus top). Thanks Robbie for the recipe!!!",

                "reviewBody": "This is an excellent recipe if you make adjustments to the amount of the ingredients. To me, you cannot call this recipe Spinach Lasagna if you use only 2 cups of fresh spinach. I believe I ended up using at least 10 cups. I had a 1 lb. tub of baby spinach and used almost all of it.  I also increased the mushrooms to 4 cups.  For the ricotta I bought a pound and a half from the deli.  I did not boil the spinach. I sauted it with the onions, mushrooms and garlic. This saves a step and a pot.          I have no idea how you use up 20 lasagna noodles in a 9 x 13 pan. I always use nine noodle and make 3 layers. For this recipe I layered a little differently than the direction.. I just mixed the ricotta cheese, Roman Cheese, egg and spices. I did not add the mushroom mixture. I layered as follows: Sauce at bottom of pan, layer of noodles, spread half of the ricotta mixture, sprinkled 1 cup of mozzarella, spread half of the spinach mixture, spread 1 cup of sauce and sprinkled 1/3 cup parmesan. I repeated this layering one more time.  Then I placed the top layer of noodles, I put the remaining mozzarella and parmesan on top of the noodles and then topped it with the remaining sauce. I found it took longer than 1 hour to cook.         This recipe turned out great. I am not so sure I would have liked it as well with the amount of spinach and mushrooms called for. This received excellent reviews from everyone who tried. it.",

I substituted 1 14-oz can chopped artichoke hearts (non-marinated) for the mushrooms.  Also, I did not pre-cook the noodles, but instead just ran them under hot water before layering them and added about 1/3 cup water to the cheese mixture.  They turned out perfectly.  I was also very generous with the tomato sauce.  I will probably add more spinach next time.

I did add quite a bit more spinach than just 2 cups fresh - that will hardly give you anything once it's cooked. I also tried a new technique and bought baby spinach in a package and didn't cook it. I layered the noodles, cheese mix and spaghetti sauce with the fresh spinach, packing in quite a bit of the fresh stuff. It turned out pretty well! And it saved a step (and a pan). Also used no-boil noodles for the first time, and was surprised to find that they actually do work pretty well (and save another step and pan). I have made lasagna based on this a few times since (not bothering to follow the recipe exactly - just from memory). I've also used frozen spinach and it works well. Thanks for a yummy recipe!",

Don't worry about people not liking the spinach, because my husband the Carnivore was fighting with his picky brother for the leftovers!  By the way, this freezes well! I froze it uncooked and baked from frozen at temp stated. My only changes: didn't have the romano and added a tad bit of FRESH grated nutmeg to the spinach.

I also removed the foil 5-7 minutes before the end of the hour to let the cheese bubble up and crust a little. Everyone LOVED it and the leftovers were ridiculously good.

I went to grab leftovers out of the fridge for lunch the next day, and they had already been consumed by people who made fun of me and my hippie lasagna. ORIGINAL REVIEW: This was amazing! My roommate is a vegetarian, so we decided to try this one night.  I wasn't keen on the idea because I'd tried many terrible meatless lasagnas in the past. But, one bite and I was hooked.  You barely even notice that it's lacking a meat flavor.  I did make some changes...I used light cheese and had to use cooked frozen spinach because fresh was banned at the time. We used Prego sauce. I also forgot to add the egg. We had a lot of filling left, probably because we like thin layers.  I'd recommend this recipe...even to people who love meaty lasagna!",

YES you can use cottage cheese, just drain it for a while and press it so most of the water comes off the taste is very similar to ricotta and cheaper. YES you can add a layer of meat, just cook it with a little minced garlic and olive oil. NO the spinach is not enough, add 1 more cup. And finally YES you can cook the spinach with the mushroom/onion mix.",
