I have my standard recipe for white bread and am very resistant to change, so I was tempted not to use the full amount of honey in this recipe as I thought it would be too sweet. In fairness to the recipe I \"braved it\" and added the full 2 tablespoons.  Since I use yeast from the jar, I just measured out 1-1/2 teaspoons. Fragrant, soft and tender, this bread has the perfect balance of sweet and salty, though it is neither. Great bread for toast, sandwiches, or even on it's own with butter and jam!",

The family likes the bread in a lofe shape so I use the dough cycle, and bake at 350 for 30 min. checking at 25min. to be safe. I forgot the salt and DH did not notice so I now skip it all the time. I use EVOO in place of the vegetable oil. It seems healther to me. All I can say is don't let the short list of ingredients stop you this is good bread, nice smooth texture, toast up well and holds up to PB & J. brush the crust with butter and it wont get hard. Thank you LJSS for a wonderfull recipe.",

One thing I did find out on my last batch...I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose flour with 3 tsp of gluten added, changed it to 18 servings like another reviewer to make a 2 lb loaf and it rose too much and not only hit the top of the lid, but overflowed. I took it out of the bread machine and separated the dough into 2 and placed in greased loaf pans and baked at 350 for 25 min and they came out great. I think from now on I will use the 18 servings adjustment and use the dough cycle on the bread machine and bake in the oven. Made great grilled cheese sandwiches and pb and j's. Definitely going into my favorites.",
