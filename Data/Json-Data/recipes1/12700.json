This is a recipe for a \"latke\" a yiddish word that is loosely translated as pancake. A latke is not a flour pancake it is a vegetable pancake-like thing. Latkes don't hold together like a smooth pancake even when made with potatoes - instead they have bits of vegetable that stick out turn crispy fall apart. So you have to imagine you're living in Eastern Europe to enjoy this simple vegetable recipe or if you really want a pancake add flour and egg. Good luck!",

Again while we enjoyed it well enough the other night I would use this to branch off for something more tailored to my family's liking. Consider this a good foundation.",
