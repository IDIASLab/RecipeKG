I would definitely recommend that you use real butter and do not substitute with margarine because it will not taste the same. Also make sure that you are using freshly grated parmesan cheese. Reserve the pasta water while draining and then add the butter to the noodles and toss together until it melts. Then add your parmesan and a little bit of the reserved pasta water as it will give the alfredo a nice creamy texture without the need to add heavy cream. Sprinkle the top with some more freshly grated parmesan and fresh ground pepper and it tastes fantastic.",

It only takes about 5-10 minutes to cook and put together which is why I LOVE it because it's something you can do last-minute or when you dont have many ingredients on hand. But I made some changes. Since I'm on a diet I used about 6-7tbsp butter and added olive oil some milk and white cooking wine to it. I also added Italian-seasoned chicken. Personally I don't think it needs to be changed but if you don't like \"simple\" tasting food you should add extra kicks to it. Four stars.",
