Cutting a raw sweet potato lengthwise is NOT an easy task, so choose the more narrow ones.  Definitely use the ziptop bag method for seasoning.  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I added more than just paprika.  We enjoy garlic salt, onion powder, thyme, salt and pepper.  Also I've found that you can cook these at 350, 375 or 400 and just adjust the baking time accordingly.  Foil on your baking sheet makes for the easiest clean up!",

I am not a fan of sweet potatoes, but learned from this recipe that you can EASILY disguise the sweet potato taste and eat healthier.  After reading the recipe reviews from this one, I raided the spice cupboard and came up with a perfect combination.  I slice the potatoes in 1/4\" round slices versus the sticks.  In a large ziploc bag, I combined olive oil, garlic powder, chili powder, salt, and pepper.  I tossed the slices in the mixture and baked them on a pizza stone for 15 minutes on each side.  In another bag I tried the brown sugar/garlic powder mixture someone else mentioned.  It was good, but not as good as the first batch.  MUST TRY!!!!!",
