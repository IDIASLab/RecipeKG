I cooked chopped apples in small amount of water added chopped peeled toms a small handful of finely chopped red onion-- NO mustard seeds no curry--. Added 1/4 cup sugar few shakes cayenne salt and nutmeg handful of sunmaids and a splosh of white vinegar. Simmered 5 minutes and served with curry (so avoided curry powder in chutney) Really good! Will definately 'fake' this recipe in future. Gotta love one you can be this careless with and still get a good result",

Beacuse the apples were so small it wasn't practical to peel them so I whizzed them up in my food processor to make the bits of skin as small as possible. This chutney is slightly too salty for my taste so next time I would decrease the salt to 15g (one level tablespoon). Kalonji (also called nigella or black onion) seeds make a nice substitute for mustard seeds - but leave them loose in the mix! Delicious.",
