The second time i tried it, i increased it to 4 tablespoons of corn starch and that solved the problem.  I don't know if that's an altitude adjustment (i live over a mile above sea level) or if it's just a general improvement\r\n\r\nThe other adjustment i would recommend makes the pie filling absolutely heavenly.  I reduced the amount of milk to 2 3/4 cups and add 1/4 cup of Bailey's Irish Cream.  That made this pie the best cream pie i have ever had.",

I used 4 generous tablespoons of cornstarch and it thickened up nicely. I tried using a rubber spatula but that seem to create clumps so I found that a wire wisk worked much better. Be sure to keep stirring! Also instead of a regular pie crust I used a store-bought chocolate graham cracker crust. I was practically licking the pot clean by the time I was done cooking. Add some whipped cream and chocolate curls and I know I'm going to have one happy father-in-law tomorrow! Thanks for this recipe!",

I used 4 yolks, 1/4 cup cornstarch (which is 4 Tbsp), and I added 1 Tbsp of coffee because it was morning and I had it.  The biggest change I made is I made this in the microwave!  It is so easy - don't be scared to try it. (got the idea from a review of coconut cream pie on this site). I followed the directions but mixed everything in a microwave safe bowl.  Once it was time to cook it, I put it in the microwave for 1 minute increments, whisking after each.  I repeated the process until the filling thickened (about 12 minutes for me, but I have a small microwave - should be 8-10).  This is much easier than standing at the stove constantly stirring.  For my topping, I made my own whipped cream but I stablized it so it'd last longer.  I sprinkled 1 tsp unflavored gelatin over 1 Tbsp cold water.  Microwaved it for 30 seconds.  Meanwhile, I poured 1 pint of whipping cream into bowl of mixer.  Whipped starting at low moving gradually to high speed.  Added gelatin, 1 tsp vanilla, and 3 Tbsp powdered sugar.  Whipped until cream held peaks.  (Don't overwhip or the cream will curdle).  Best chocolate cream pie ever (and so easy,too!).",
