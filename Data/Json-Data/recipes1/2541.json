I agree that cutting them in squares is tedious so I rolled the dough out put the sugar and cinnamon on and proceeded to make a roll just like cinnamom buns. Them I cut them in slices and put four slices together. I pinched the top half together a little and put them in my muffin pan. Next time I would use a little less flour in the dough to make it easier to roll out.",
