Contrary to the earlier reviewers' negative comments I think this type of sweetbread is supposed to be rather dense which is exactly the appeal. If you bake all 6 at the same time however increase bake time to 45-50 minutes at sea level and rotate the pans between shelves halfway through to avoid burning the inside crust. Also while I too found that the dough didn't rise nearly as much as expected it did rise to a perfect level during baking. Hang with this recipe and you'll get a perfectly delicious sweet bread!!",
