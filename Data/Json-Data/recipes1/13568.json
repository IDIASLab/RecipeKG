This was wonderful and so easy.  I did make a change though, I wanted to use beef drippings and didnt have any.  So I first melted 4Tbsp  shortening and 1tsp of beef soup base (powder) in the microwave.  Then I put that mixture in the muffin tins instead of margerine.  It gave them the wonderful flavor of using traditional beef drippings!  Thanks for the reciepe.  My family loved them.",
