I skipped the mushrooms and celery and used 1/2 parmesan cheese and 1/2 cheddar cheese on top to give it some more color and then used imitation bacon bits for convenience.

The combination of ingredients is great I didn't change a thing even though I am not a mushroom fan and considered leaving them out but I loved them in this. The extra flavors in the dressing are just enough to make it stand out from the usual basic mayo topping often used in similar recipes... next time the only changes I might make just for my personal taste would be to add just a bit more of the garlic and brown sugar to the dressing and maybe a bit more chopped egg in the salad. I misread the layering instructions and instead of only one layer of each of the veggies I did two layers of each and had it in a clear rectangular container so it didn't look as \"layered\" as it would have if I had done it right but still turned out perfectly. Made it the night before a potluck at work and it went over very well but we had so much food there that I did have some leftovers to bring home and the salad stayed fresh and crisp tasting even to the next day.",
