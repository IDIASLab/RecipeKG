For the rub I added 1/4 tsp. of chili powder and 1/4 tsp. of cumin. I put everything into a ziploc bag added the olive oil (1/2 cup) garlic lime juice (1 cup) and cilanto along with some lime zest. I let this marinate for 24 hours. I didn't bother boiling the excess marinade - there wasn't much left as the chicken soaked it up plus I usually just baste it during grilling. This chicken was moist had a nice kick to it and was delicious!",
