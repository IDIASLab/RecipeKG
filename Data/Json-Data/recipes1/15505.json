I sauted them with diced onions and celery in place of the carrots. Once slightly tender, I mixed the veggies with the sour cream and soup.  I covered with one sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers and then used 2c of the blue bag of Pepperidge Farm crushed stuffing not the cornbread.  Delicious.  Needed a little S&P but very popular hit at our house.  A keeper for sure.  Thanks!!",

I added a little more sour cream than called for I added 1 onion to the squash mix I used about 2 cups more zucchini 1/2 cup of french fried onions to the 1/2 cup of dressing I sat aside. After I spread the squash mix on the dressing I layered about 8 oz. of Muenster cheese on top of that. I finished off with the french fried onions I had mixed with the 'sat aside' dressing. Next time I will add chopped basil from the garden. This is a good recipe and will get rid of a lot of that garden zucchini. It also tasted the same if not better the next day. Next I will try freezing it. Katherine",
