Just a few things we would change: we used a red onion which was a mistake; much too sweet for this recipe. Next time it'll be a plain old yellow onion. Additionally next time we will either substitute hash browns for the sausage or simply add the hash browns as an additional layer. Also I would recommend a bit of salt. A delicious recipe concept; everyone's tastes are different!",
