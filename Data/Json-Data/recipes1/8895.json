I've tried it in my older bread machine and in my Cuisinart and no matter how I did it it was always much too wet! Maybe letting it finish in the bread machine helps? Also the 2nd rising never goes as well as I'd like it too and we end up with very small dense loaves. The taste and smell are excellent 5 stars but something is wrong here with water content. I'll keep trying different amounts of water and see if I can correct the issue.",
