And that's okay I had to throw out what was in the pan (it was like a big gluey hard mess!) but it wasn't a big deal. I had already made the dough so I just did tablespoon-sized drop cookies. They came out so soft and yummy very similar to the Carrot Cookies with Orange Glaze recipe my mother's been making since I was little but without the carrots and spice. Not too sweet so my husband (who has no sweet tooth at all!) enjoyed them. Thank you Jady I WILL try the filling again one day!",
