So after I spent the next 30 minutes chipping a rock-hard blob of sugar out of the bottom of my dish, I tried it again. But this time, I put the baking dish in a hot oven for about 5 minutes before adding the sugar. The hot dish kept the sugar liquified just long enough for me to get an even coating. After I learned that trick, the flan turned out very well. I made this for dessert after a Mexican-themed dinner, and everyone really liked it.",

Let me tell you, I have made this recipe for years and sometimes it hardens like u said and theres no problem, since you normally put the flan mixture on top and its going to be cooked in the oven, melting the caramel again, evenly on the bottom. So, if the caramel is not spreaded evenly at the beginning, dont worry, the flan is going to turn out amazing anyway..",

Everyone who tries it LOVES it, even people who don't necessarily have a liking for flan.  People also keep asking me when I am going to make it again.  The melted sugar is very simple if you pay attention because it will seem like the sugar will never melt and then all of sudden it is brown and fluid.  Simply pour into the pan quickly and try to coat as much as possible before it hardens.  It doesn't matter if it coats the bottom of the pan unevenly because the flan mixture sitting in the pan for 8 hours while it is refrigerating, will smooth out the melted sugar and make a perfect topping once it is flipped.  (Trust me, both times the sugar hardened too quickly but the end result was perfection.)",

Some other reviews had trouble with the caramel but I made mine - just sugar - in about 7 minutes. I did warm the pan in the oven while it was heating and everything turned out a dream. One note about the pans - you really need a proper deep cake pan (NOT springform as water will get in) - I used an 8\" pan with 3\" sides and it was perfect. I did have a 10\" pan but found it wouldn't fit into any of my baking pans for the \"bath\" - I also would find it challenging to find a 10\" rimmed platter (and it does need a rim as the caramel is runny) - so the 8\" was great to fit into a baking pan and onto a plate.",

Some tips I used were to let the eggs and cream cheese come to room temp before mixing, be sure to beat well after each egg is added for the lightest texture and don't overcook sugar in the first step. If you do make more than one at a time like I did, do not try to do the carmelized sugar in one large batch, it will not work well, I had brittle sugar by the time it had all melted, then I redid it in individual batches. But I used the brittle for decoration.",
