Our family doesn't usually love soup so I don't make it often but decided to give this a whirl after ordering something similar at a restaurant. I made a few changes. I added cubed red potatoes, diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes, onions, baby bella mushrooms, two cloves of garlic, basil and a bay leaf. Topped each bowl with parmesean cheese. It was FANTASTIC!! You can really add just about anything you like to a recipe like this. I also used elbow macaroni because it was all I had on hand. The aroma was so wonderful. My husband wasn't excited when he saw that I was making soup for dinner but he quickly changed his mind after the first bite. He went back for thirds. Even my kids who are picky eaters asked for more. To date this is the absolute BEST recipe I've found on this site and I've tried many!! Thanks for sharing this. I'll make it over and over. Very easy to make too!!",

Instead of dried onion soup mix I used 1 cup each of chopped fresh onions and celery slowly sauteed over low heat for 10 minutes in 1 T. oil and then added 4 beef bouillon cubes along with the water. I substituted beef broth for the chicken broth a can of diced tomatoes for the stewed tomatoes and then left out the canned green beans because I didn't have any. I also added a cup of chopped cabbage to add some more fiber to the soup. I reduced the bread crumbs and parmesan cheese in the meatballs to 1/2 cup each (otherwise the meatballs would be all filler) and added 1/2 tasp. of Italian seasoning. I thought it needed more seasoning when it was done so I added some dried basil and oregano to it. I also added extra beef broth to balance out the extra veggies I put in. This is a good hearty basic recipe that you can adjust depending on the veggies broth and seasoning you have on hand.",

Well this soup tasted just like I remember it! I thought it needed more broth so I added 2 more cups of water to it. I also added 2 cups of celery. This made for a lot of veggies! Also 1 lb of meat may be a lot. I should have made the meatballs a bit smaller but I ended up with about 60 meatballs the size I made them. (I also added garlic powder to them) My meatballs came out a bit dry so next time I will add an extra egg. Only other thing is this makes a lot of soup so get ready to freeze batches. Thank you Judy Henry this is going into my recipe box and will be made every winter!!!",

The bread crumbs were Italian breadcrumbs and I added about 1tsp Kosher salt and 2tsp of adobo (you could sub Lawry's or poultry season) and 3 eggs total but that was to 2.25lbs of ground beef. It was a perfect ratio of vegetables to pasta to broth meatballs. I added just under 60 meatballs to the soup and froze the rest.The last change was adding a small can of tomato sauce. The recipe for me made about 9 servings and of course I have about 100 mini meatballs for another use! I think if I hadn't added the additional seasoning to the meatballs they would have been a bit bland. Excellent soup!",
