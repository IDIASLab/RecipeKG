Meanwhile because the corn meal is cooked along with all of the milk rather than having some cold milk stirred in the end the result is a single thick layer. Traditionally at least in the New England family I grew up in Indian Pudding should have two layers a thick layer with cornmeal at the bottom and a lighter milk-only layer on top. It also needs raisins preferably soaked in whiskey or rum.",

For anyone else who may try it: I didn't have a double boiler and so did it in a sauce pot with a thick bottom over gas heat (easy to control!) My cook time on the stove was closer to 15 minutes as a result and 1.5 hours in the oven as directed. As everyone else says serve warm with a really good vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream. Awesome with a steaming cup of coffee alongside... I will add raisins next time - just a personal preference. TERRIFIC RECIPE!!",

I made it exactly as the recipe called for & the taste was reminiscent of pumpkin pie. My suggestion for the recipe directions would be to explain a little more thoroughly about the double boiler because I was not very familiar with it before this. Also the recipe says to use a 1 1/2 quart baking dish but when I poured the pudding into the dish it filled it to the brim & while in the oven overflowed. Otherwise this was very good especially with some vanilla ice cream on top!",
