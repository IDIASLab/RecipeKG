I bought lowfat ricotta cheese, used only 3/4 cup mozzarella + 1/2 cup parmesan in the filling (added 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp pepper, and would do that again), and left off the cheese in the sauce, just sprinkling a bit of parmesan after baking so it looked pretty.  It made two 13x9x2 pans, and I wish I had used 2 jars of sauce instead of 1.  The sauce dried out after baking, so next time, I will cover with aluminum foil first, and remove it the last 10 minutes or so.  Thanks so much for the recipe - will definitely be making it again!",

This recipe needed more than a little tweaking though.  I made the following changes.  1 tsp. of salt instead of two.  4 oz. of parmesan total (two in the filling and two in the sauce).  I substituted Italian Seasoning for the parsley.  I added about a half tsp. of garlic powder to the filling too.  I skipped the mushrooms and added Italian sausage to the sauce instead.  You will need two jars of sauce PER TRAY of shells or they will be dry.  Prepared with the changes specified, my fianc\u00e9 said he could \u201ceat himself into the hospital he\u2019d eat so many of these shells if he could.\u201d  Sounds like a good review to me!",

There was a few things I changed and they were perfect! I did not add eggs and I only put 1/2 tsp salt. I added alittle more ricotta to taste to get it not as much so cheesy as I wanted it more creamy. That is the secret to any stuffed shell recipe! I used a regular homemade italian tomato sauce. I did not use mushrooms! And I didnt alter this dish to look like a deep dish piiza as it states. It is a time consuming recipe , but if you like it homemade it is worth the effort!",
