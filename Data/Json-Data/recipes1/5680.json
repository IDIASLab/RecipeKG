I used a whole cucumber seeded and chopped; 2 cups of chopped broccoli; a whole red pepper seeded and chopped. I combined the rest of the ingredients to make a dressing then added it to the pasta and vegetables. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 3 tablespoons of Miracle Whip. After adjustments I really did enjoy the flavor with the mustard being a nice change of pace from the usual creamy pasta salad. The recipe as written makes a huge amount so I probably won't make a full recipe again unless it's for a church supper.",
