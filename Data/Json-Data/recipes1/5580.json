I followed the suggestion of the previous reviewer and added 3 eggs, and there were STILL pockets of dry flour!  I think all in all, I used 3 eggs, and 2 1/4 cups milk.  Because of the lack of fat, this cake would not keep that well without drying out (it's interesting, because other scripture cakes have oil added).  To increase keeping qualities, I'd reduce amount of sugar to 1 cup, and add 1 cup honey.  I added \u00bd cup chopped dates (Deut. 34:3), and grated zest of 2 oranges (Deut. 33:14).  Some additional scriptural refs:  the raisin reference in the recipe is incorrect, it is actually 1 Samuel 30:12.  I also prefer the salt ref of Job 6:6, and for the baking soda, the best ref is 1 Cor. 5:6 (although if you're Jewish you'll have to find another one!).",

I Samuel 14:25 (honey),\n6 of Jeremiah 17:11 (eggs),\n1/2 cup Judges 4:19 (Last Clause) (milk),\n2 tsp . Amos 4:5 (baking powder),\nSeason to taste with 2 Chronicles 9:9. \n\nI am thinking the last ingredient (s) are salt, cinnamon,  allspice, nutmeg, mace (some or a combination of all)\n\nGrandma did not include directions, but I think I would follow standard procedure creaming the sugar and butter together, add the eggs  and honey and beat till incorporated. Stir in the prepared fruit. Sift together the flour and remaining dry ingredients and work in. I would bake it all in greased loaf pans (how many depends on size) at 300 degrees F.  for 1 hour to start. Check for doneness and add time as necessary.",
