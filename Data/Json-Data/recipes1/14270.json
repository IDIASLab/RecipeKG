I made the recipe as posted and without blending the ice with it as that is how I first ever had one. Without the ice blended into it is better but either way it s good to me. If you re going to use fresh mango make sure it is almost if not over ripe it is true they can be fibrous if they haven t come to complete ripeness. Canned mango works well and is more convenient since you can keep it in the refrigerator chilled for whenever the urge hits you!",

The yogurt cuts the sweetness and you can make it thinner like the restaurant lassis by adding more milk or thicker like a shake by adding more ice whatever is to your taste. A delicious healthy drink. Highly recommended",
