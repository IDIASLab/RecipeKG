I missed the flavor that comes when a barbeque sauce is simmered on the stove I think I would do that next time I make this recipe.",

I've also been using spices bought at my local spice shop making the a bit higher quality and fresher. My husband RAVED about this and used it on everything he could (chicken ribs mashed potatoes rolls I even caught him eating it straight out of the bowl at 2 AM). I asked how he liked it and he said it was fabulous but could maybe use some whiskey (Impressive since he didn't know that it should have been in there but hey what do I know I'm just the cook: - ) So for next batch I'll get a small bottle of whiskey to try with it.
