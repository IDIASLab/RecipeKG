I made a small batch following the recipe word for word without any adjustments and it came out rather bland and like others said chewy. Having read the reviews and taken them to heart I only made a SMALL batch. I then prepared another batch as follows: I seasoned the pretzels after chopping them in the blender for a minute or so. Added garlic salt or powder (depending on whether your pretzels are already salty) and red peper flakes to the pretzels. Then I added a dash or so of sriracha sauce (Thai hot sauce so good!) to the half of the mustard mixture that I used for dredging my chicken to give it a little kick. In order for them to be crispier as opposed to chewy I sprayed the chicken with a cooking spray (reg or butter flavored) before placing them in the oven and then taking them out halfway flipping the chicken over and spraying again. I had the oven preheated at 350 and it took about 15 min. to cook the chicken.",
