Marinating the meat is fine but we do not use the beans celery or carrots. After browning the meat we also deglaze the pan with either the white wine or beer. As for the potatoes we fry the cubed potatoes and serve the pork and clams over the potatoes. This dish is best made simply most of the flavor comes from the clams.",

I did add carrot and celery because it was crying for color and some mussels because I couldn't decide between them and clams. Wonderful! The only warning I would give is to add half of your salt to the marinade and wait to see if you need the rest at the end of cooking. The broth was fantastic, but on the edge of being too salty. I'll make this again and again - with no fear. ;)",

I also used 1 tbsp of cumin seeds (not ground) I used orange and red pepper for color (added last minute so heated but firm) and I used mussels not clams. I'm already planning the next time I will make this dish thanks for sharing!",
