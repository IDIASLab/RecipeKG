                "reviewBody": "Only because I have spent many years working in restaurants and spent quite a bit of time actually talking with a vendor at the MN State fair who explained his process, I feel the need to weigh in on these reviews.  The cheese curds should be fresh, at room temperature and when they at room temp, shake them around in little bit of flour to lightly coat them.  When the curds are at room temperature, they \"sweat\" out some of the natural fat so that the flour will adhere to the curd.  This step also ensures that that the batter will stick to the curds in the fryer. The batter should be made with beer, not milk and be fairly thin. Excess batter after dipping the curds should be drained from them in a wire mesh strainer (they actually had a very large flat one for this part) but a larger mesh strainer at home works too. The temperature of the oil is critical, the gentleman I spoke with said they keep their fryer at about 375 degrees.  Also, the amount of oil used is very important; keep in mind that at the fairs they are using fryers that hold several gallons of oil, a home fryer uses 1.5 to 2 quarts on average so you can't fry very many at a time if you want them to turn out to be the delicious, golden, melty cheese curds we all love at the fair. I have been making these this way for 15 years or so and always get raves for these.  Hope this helps anyone who has had problems with the batter sticking or everything turning into a gooey mess.",

My roommate found a dairy in Marin County that sold cheese curds at the farmers market on Saturday's in San Francisco. She went down and picked up three pounds and I proceeded to practice the night before the game using this recipe. Much to my dismay they were not the flaky nuggets of molten cheese heaven I craved; they instead tasted like lumps of cold curd wrapped in a burnt pancake. Check out the beer batter intended for fish also found on this site and use that recipe instead: it will give you a much better taste of real Wisconsin cheese curds.",

Followed it to a tea....it tasted somewhat like burnt pancakes with a hint of cheese. I'm used to minnesota state fair cheese curds so maybe my expecations were a little lofty but these curds were way too fluffy and there was barely any cheese left after being fried. I fried them in a deep frier which shouldn't matter since they're submerged in oil either way but in the end I was left with a fluffy pancake type substance with more cheese floating in and stuck to my deep frier than were in the curds. I would not recommend this recipe to anybody unless they want a huge mess with nothing to show for it. P.S. As LIBBYWYNN said in her review \"They were just like the ones at the Minnesota State Fair!!\". THEY WERE NOT EVEN IN THE SAME BALLPARK OR LEAGUE AS MINNESOTA STATE FAIR CHEESE CURDS.
