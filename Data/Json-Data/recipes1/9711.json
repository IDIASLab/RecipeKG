This is not a \"cake-like\" consistency but Mississipi Mud cake isn't supposed to have a cake-like consistency. It's like a very rich brownie covered with melted marshmallows and topped with a wonderful chocolate frosting. We loved it and my daughter said I could do this for her birthday from now on. The richness cries out for a tall glass of cold milk; pure Heaven. Thank you for sharing!!",
