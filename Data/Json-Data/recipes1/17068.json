I partially froze sirloin vs. tenderloin (cheaper) to cut it thin and then let that marinate in red wine garlic and Worchesterchire for two hours before cooking. I cooked that then plated it. I used a vidalia onion (about 3/4 cup) portabella mushrooms and sauteed them in little garlic. I also added 1 Tbsp. of Worchestershire for a flavor boost. I reserved a bit of the broth to mix with 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch vs. 3 tsp. to thicken then added the sour cream with 3 oz. cream cheese. I served it over egg noodles - YUM!",

I gauge recipes by whether my husband or kids take seconds.  My husband took seconds, and my kids took seconds thirds and fourths.\n\nI used a bit more Shallots than called for, and I would definitely stick with shallots and not substitute onions.",

Also, the recipe has you brown the meat and never has you come back to finish cooking it, only has you warm it back up so essentially you're eating raw meat.  I do like that this recipe uses sirloin instead of hamburger meat but it really lacked any flavor.  I think hamburger helper is better than this.  Sorry!",
