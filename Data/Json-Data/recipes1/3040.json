I used margarine instead of butter 1 cup of graham wafer crumbs and corn syrup instead of the egg. For the filling I used more like a tablespoon of vanilla. TASTE the filling before spreading it over the base!! If it tastes too much like powdered sugar add more vanilla! I did just that and it saved the filling. I doubled the ingredients for the chocolate topping and it was the perfect amount to cover the whole pan. The end result tasted a little different than I'm used to but I DID have to omit the coconut. Next time I think I'll add a little cocoa to the base so there's more chocolate flavor but they DID turn out really tasty. Thanks Shirly!",
