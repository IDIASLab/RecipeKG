                "reviewBody": "I just pulled my \"apple sheet cake\" out of the oven about an hour ago and already had a piece.  It was delicious! The crust is not like your ordinary pie crust - it's more biscuit like (probably because there is baking powder in the crust). I think the crust might be a tad bit better if it had some sugar in it.  It's plenty sweet with the apple filling & icing but the edges by themselves are not sweet enough. I made 1 1/2 recipes of the pastry because I suck at rolling out pie dough and I thought that rolling it out to the size of a jelly roll pan would be difficult for me.  1 1/2 recipes turned out to be perfect for me! I had enough dough to really get a nice looking edge to my crust that I could crimp nicely. It prevented any leaks of the filling and did not brown too much.  The only small change I made in the recipe is to add one more tablespoon of flour in the filling because I was worried about it being too thin. I cut it when the pie/cake was still very warm and it did not ooze at all.  Sliced very nicely.  I prepared my filling before I started on my crust and so my filling had a chance to produce alot of juice at the bottom of the bowl which I left in the bowl as I scooped the apples into the crust. I've had so many pies with soggy bottom crusts that I tried hard to prevent it from happening again.  I used 3 different kinds of apples and didn't weigh them but used about 7 or 8 medium apples.  I sliced them very thinly because 30 minutes in the oven is not a long time ",

I have made this many of times now  everyone always loves it....sometimes i will add rasins(golden rasins) and walnuts....but its great as is too. I double dough recipe and used 12 x 18 sheet pan & had alittle left over dough,but I like having anuff to work with..its a easy dough to work with on a flour dusted table..I use flour to dust and roll the dough...I like it best with granny smith apples, I wash and core them,then just slice them up, with the peel on them..(big time saver)no one ever knows differance...if you use red apples you will have to peel them, otherwise you will have bits of red, not pretty...I also but alittle cinn and brown sugar in the dough...I use this recipe for pot luck dinners, its always a number 1 dessert, ice cream is good on top also. love it. Note if you dont want it watery...use granny smith apple , they hold their juices.....poeple always love it!",

I have made this using both butter and shortening for the dough, butter makes a more tender crust. It is a job rolling it out to fit into the pan but the dough is easier to handle than regular piecrust. Definitely a hard to categorize dessert, it's not a \"cake\", more of a pie in a sheet pan. My husband said \"It's like a cross between an apple pie and a danish... but better.\" I'll be making this one again. The icing's called for amounts frosts the dessert VERY generously, you could get away with half as much (if you wanted to!).",

This is the only recipe I ever spend the time making home-made dough for & it is well worth it. It's a big pan but they get eaten fast! Let's be realistic it takes time peeling/slicing apples & rolling out the crust if you're not used to it (I bought a tupperware rolling sheet & that helps me a ton). I usually cut the frosting amount in half-it's just too much. These are just as good refrigerated as they are fresh. Forget apple pie & move on up to this recipe!",

I found that rolling the pastry out on parchment paper worked out well if you don't roll it out thin enough the pastry is to thick and didn't make the \"frosting\".
