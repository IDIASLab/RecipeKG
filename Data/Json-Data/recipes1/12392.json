I laid out the crescent roll pieces on a pizza pan and could tell pretty quickly it wasn't going to be easy to make a circle that covered the pan. So I took the suggestion of using a 9x13 and coaxed the pieces into fitting with a little help from my rolling pin. I also took the suggestion of baking the crescent roll crust for a few minutes (6min?) before adding the toppings - VERY helpful!\n\nOther changes I made included using Morningstar Griller crumbles instead of sausage to make it vegetarian and using a Mexican 3 cheese blend to add a little kick. I didn't brown the crumbles because they seem to cook just fine even when added frozen, but I did the brown the hash browns, just for good measure.\n\nI still baked it for 25 min even though I had pre-baked the crust a little, and let it sit for a few minutes before serving. It was EXCELLENT!!",

I added 2 oz. of canned diced Jalapenos, a four ounce can of diced green chilies, (Ortega is good.) Eight ounces of sliced fresh mushrooms, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and two cups of shredded pepper-jack cheese, all added to an increased 7 egg and milk mixture. Also added an extra 1/2 lb. of ground pork sausage.  This was beyond excellant.  This one's a keeper, for sure.  Thanks Tammy.",

One can of (reduced fat) crescent rolls completely covered the bottom and up the sides. (Don't forget to grease the pan first!) I pre-cooked the crust for 5 minutes but won't next time - it was a bit over cooked in the end. To lighten it up a little I used low fat sausage and egg substitute and no one knew the difference. I also lightly pre-cooked the hash browns and added some roasted red peppers -they were the perfect compliment! I will definitely be making this again and again and again! (My picky eater teenage son even went back for thirds! -but he did pick out the roasted peppers:) Thanks for a Terriffic recipe!!! mmmmmmmmm",

I always omit the hash browns and parmesan and add some crumbled cooked bacon and it is wonderful. I make homemade sausage gravy for the \"pizza sauce\" as another review suggested. Also pre-baking the crust for 5-7 minutes helps the crust to get done and not be gooey once the toppings have been added. For some cooks who commented the eggs ran everywhere: Scramble the eggs first in a skillet and then add them to the pizza. You'll be a lot more pleased with this!",
