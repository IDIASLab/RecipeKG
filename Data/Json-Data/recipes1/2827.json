Historically I have not had great luck with noodles - ask me to bring Pork Tenderloin en Croute no problem but noodles defied me. These turned out great and I think I figured out what I had done wrong in the past - not enough flour. They were terribly sticky initially and I thought they were done for I added a tad more flour a Tablespoon at at time and they turned out great! I rolled them out on the counter-top with plenty of flour top and bottom and covered them with a tea towel and let them sit for a hour before cutting with a pizza cutter. I tossed the cut noodles in the leftover flour and popped them into a baggie and frozen them for the next day. I left them frozen until I popped them into the boiling water. We served them naked so folks could put gravy or butter on them. Very good I will make them again. Oh one comment I used freshly ground black pepper - I LOVE pepper and they were almost too peppery - almost.",
