                "reviewBody": "Delicious!  After one bite, my husband said this was the best chicken parmesan he has ever had and told me immediately to put this one in the recipe box.  I have to agree, this dish is definitely more than worthy of 5 stars.  There are changes I would say is a must though, and I read a lot of the reviews.  If you don't do anything else, do these three things - #1) Pound your chicken breasts to an even half-inch thickness.  This allows the chicken to stay moist and cook evenly in the skillet.  #2) Cut the breading/parmesan mixture in half and reduce the beaten egg to 1.  It was more than enough for me, and this is the type of ingredient you can always make more of, but if you make too much at first it will go to waste. #3) Add the cheese slices the last 5 minutes of cooking.  20 min. would be too long and burn the cheese.  After 5 min. my cheese melted perfectly.\r\n I also added a bit of garlic powder & onion powder to the bread crumb mixture, and used Mozzarella cheese slices instead.  As a time saver, when you buy a value pack of chicken breasts, pound some and put them individually in ziplock bags in the freezer.  You can defrost them on short notice for this meal.  I also prepared most of it while my 10 month old napped, and put the prepared 9x13 dish in the fridge until I was ready to pop it in the oven.  I love everything about this recipe, from prep to taste - try it!!",

The only thing that I did differently was that after I coated the chicken with the breadcrumb/parmesan cheese mixture, I set it aside in the refridgerator for about 30 minutes so that the coating would stick really well to the chicken when it was cooking in the skillet later. I also used mozarella cheese slices rather than monterey jack cheese.",

Added extra dried onion and garlic powder, dried oregano and sweet basil to the bread crumbs as I didn't have the seasoned variety on hand.  Tip from other reviewers:  Pound the chicken to 3/4\", let the coated chicken sit in the fridge for 20 minutes prior to preparation so that the breading will stick better.  Didn't have Monterey Jack cheese so I subbed smoked mozzarella which sent it over the top!!!!  Absolutely sublime!!!  Used Bertolli's tomato and basil sauce and mixed the remainder of the sauce with cooked egg noodles al dente and then layered the egg noodles on the bottom of the baking dish.  Put the chicken on top and then cooked for 15 minutes.  Per other reviews, added the cheese the last 5 to 7 minutes to melt and brown.  This was unbelievabley good and definitely going into my rotation.  You absolutely have to try this!  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!!!!",

I also added the jack cheese during the last 5 minutes, as others suggested.  My husband thought he didn't care for chicken parm, but this was a real hit. It turned out perfect, crispy and moist.

Instead of only putting the sauce in the pan, and setting the chicken ON TOP, I poured the sauce on the bottom of the casserole dish, and then I poured the rest of the jar ON TOP of the chicken! This made for a more tender dish. Also, I sprinkled parm. cheese on the dish before I put it in the oven. Overall, it was delicious, tender and tangy-- YUM!! Overall grade: A+",

I used Italian bread crumbs, and took advice of others and baked the coated chicken for about 20 minutes prior to baking the dish, instead of frying. I then assembled the chicken over the sauce and baked for 15 minutes then last 5 minutes I added the cheese. I think that this makes delish chicken nuggests/strips as well.",

A tip for \"BRANDYNM\" who's breading was falling off while frying; place your breaded chicken cutlets in the fridge for about thirty minutes or so and you won't have a problem.
