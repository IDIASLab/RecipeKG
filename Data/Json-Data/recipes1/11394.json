The ONLY thing I added was as suggested by other reviews was about 2 or 3 T of A1 sauce to cut down on the soy sauce taste. When i put it on the grill, I did put more black pepper on top and added a little bit of grated parmesan cheese too. And basted the steak with left over marinade while cooking.\nMy boyfriend said \"is there anymore\" and i made sure there was no leftover juices on my plate when my steak was gone. This was BY FAR the best steak i have ever made and i've made some good steaks in the past. Thank you for sharing the recipe. I have emailed it to LOTS of people and printed a copy for all meat-eaters here at the office. \nI am never using any other steak marinade.",

I then added about five pounds of sirloin and allowed it to marinate about eight hours, turning regularly and \"massaging\" the marinade into the meat.  Also, I scored the surface of the meat slightly with a very sharp knife, in a \"diamond\" pattern to aid in the absorption of the flavor.  The steaks were about 1\" thick.  I cooked half of the meat then, it was delicious.  The other half I allowed to marinate over night and that was even better.  The steaks were very tender and flavorful.  I, out of habit, added some pepper sauce before tasting the meat, but everyone else enjoyed it without additional condiments, except a little salt.  We will make this again, possibly even this weekend.  We cooked the steaks on a cast iron grill pan over medium high heat for about 7 - 8 minutes per side.  Husbot just finished some leftover steak and remarked yet again how delicious it was.",
