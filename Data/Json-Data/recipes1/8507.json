You can also use WAY MORE lentils than what is mentioned here. I let them soak for about 4 hours, or overnight, it does not matter. If you do not have crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce works fine.  I save money by using dried parsley because it is so expensive to buy it fresh where I live. They make you buy a huge bundle of it. Thanks for the recipe!    Also, this is HUGE:  It tastes WAY WAY WAY better the 2nd day. If you eat it fresh out of the pan, it is so-so, but if you put it in a big jar and eat it the next day, Mmmmmm.......",

I used a cheap Shiraz wine but as long as you would drink it, it's all good. Just don't use cooking wine...blech. I chose red because white wine is for the lighter \"meats\" and lentils are the vegeterian equivalent of beef! Now, wine has a tendency to make things seem more salty (chemistry smarties will probably know the reason for this), so for stock, I used  Glace de Poulet Gold, which is low-sodium, restaurant-quality, and absolutely ROCKS. (NOTE: I am not in any way affiliated with the brand, nor do I own company stock -- a little pun for you clever types).  I kept the spices the same, except at the end I added a dash of red pepper flakes for a little kick, as we're a wild and crazy bunch around here.",

(The acid prevents the lentils from softening.) This makes the recipe much easier with no sacrifice in taste. - I used smoked paprika, which gave the taste usually achieved by adding a smoked ham hock but keeps the recipe vegetarian and easy. (Veg broth or water can easily substitute for the chicken broth. I used beef broth myself.) - I used three kinds of lentils, and I don't think it mattered. Use whatever you like or have available. - If you're dieting you could add more carrots and celery. - I agree with the next day comment. Now is day 3 and I think I'll eat some more right now.",
