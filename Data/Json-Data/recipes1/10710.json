Like other reviewers have mentioned, I tenderized the steak. Then I dipped the steak in egg before the crumb mixture to help it stick. I fried these in batches in my electric frying pan. I then placed it all on a baking sheet and spread the spagetti sauce over it and baked for about 10 minutes then I added mozz cheese to top it all off, returned it to the oven and baked until the cheese had melted. It was wonderful! I should mention that I used Italian bread crumbs and added oregano to the breading mixture. \r\n\r\nI will certainly be making this again!",

After frying I placed them on a cookie sheet sprinkled on some mozzarella cheese and broiled for a few mins. I heated the spaghetti sauce separately and let the family put on as much as they wanted.

They can be chewy at times. I would suggest dipping meat in a beaten egg so that crumbs stay on better. After pounding meat it gets a bit bigger, so I had to fry these in batches. Couldn't fit all in fry pan to cook with sauce so I put on a baking sheet. Baked at 350 for 15 min. then topped with sauce and provolone and parmesan cheese. Also suggest using Mozzarella. Baked an additional 10 min. Next time I would cut back on baking time, after these are browned in fry pan, they really don't have to cook long. Made up my own sauce for this. Not bad and a very inexpensive meal. Thanks Mary Lynn!",
