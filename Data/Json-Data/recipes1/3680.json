When the potatoes were tender I used a potato masher and slighty mashed some of the potatoes the make the soup thicken and omitted the cornstarch. I added leftover turkey pieces and various herbs and spices like paprika basil garlic salt and pepper. I don't like cheese in my soup and I thought 2 cups of cheese was a little much anyways so instead I just sprinkled some cheese on the top when I dished the soup up in individual bowls. It was a great change from my usual \"leftover turkey from thanksgiving soup\" and a delicious way to use up leftover potatoes and turkey! Thanks for the recipe it's a keeper!",

My only modifications are to use colby-jack cheese instead of cheddar because that's what we usually have on hand and to add about three tbsp of crumbled bacon when I add the potatoes so the flavor cooks in. I do use Kitchen Basics gluten-free broth since we are gluten-intolerant and this way I can be sure it's safe. But this is hands-down the best recipe I have found for potato soup.",
