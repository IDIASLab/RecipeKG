Raise the temperature to 450, however, and you'll have nicely browned potatoes with somewhat crispy edges and a creamy interior.  I turned the potatoes 15 minutes into cooking time, then turned them and roasted them for an additional 10 minutes. Great eye appeal, and they taste as good as they look. Easily five stars just by raising the oven temperature.",
