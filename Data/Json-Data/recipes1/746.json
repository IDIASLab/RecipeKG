I followed the recipe almost exactly- just added 2 more tablespoons of flour and another 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt. Also instead of mixing in mini chips, I added three regular-sized chocolate chips to the center of each pb cookie after baking. For the crumbling problem- baking longer is not the answer!! I would recommend using insulated baking sheets and a good, thin, metal pancake turner to remove the cookies. Be sure to allow them to cool for 1-2 minutes before removing.",

The dough was soft so I already had concerns, but given the mixed reviews I chose to plod on and follow the recipe with no changes other than to chill the dough overnight. The result was a cookie that was so soft it had little structure to support it once it was picked up - as others experienced, it fell apart into pieces, pieces that were too fatty and not sweet enough.  I compared this recipe to a similar recipe I loved, with a 2:1 ratio of peanut butter to butter - and what  I found explains what went wrong with this recipe.  It needs 2 T. more of both brown sugar and white sugar, which explains why these cookies were not sweet enough.  The recipe needs more flour, maybe 1/4 cup, which explains why they were too fatty (I'd almost call them kind of soggy) and had so little structure.  In the end, while I liked the double amount of peanut butter to butter, this pretty much fell apart after that - pun intended.",
