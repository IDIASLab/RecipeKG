After making the first half of the batch I added some mini chocolate chips (for I didn't have enough for the WHOLE batch). I like the idea of having a stir in for the cookies nuts would be a great option too! It'a a lovely cookie kinda reminds me of vanilla wafers. Kids love them Will make again! (I also made with whole wheat flour much healthier then the white!)",
