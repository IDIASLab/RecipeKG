I cooked for 3 hours on the low temperature, checked for doneness, and the cake still hadn\u2019t even started to firm up. Kicked up the temperature to medium for another hour, still not even close to being done.  Finally, I cooked for another hour (now total of 5 hours) on high, and although it firmed up a little, a toothpick inserted into center didn\u2019t come out clean, the cake still was soggy.  It tastes pretty good, but it\u2019s just \u201cmushy\u201d for lack of a better word.  I have to wonder if using pineapple tidbits would yield a better consistency than using crushed pineapple.  I\u2019ve made a number of dump cakes, most have had more or less a streusel/crumb topping, and I guess I just prefer that.  It tastes OK, but doubtful I\u2019d make again even making adjustments on the cooking temperature.",
