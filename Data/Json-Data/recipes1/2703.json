That second time I reduced the amount of orange peel. I only used 1/2 of the peel from the orange. Using all the orange peel made it bitter and the orange over powered the other flavors. Also make sure that you cook the sugar and cranberries long enough. If not you will have sugar crystals which you do not want.",

The consistency is nice too. I ended up picking all the orange rind bits out for two reasons: My food processor didn't chop them uniformly and the bits looked unappetizing as well as out of place. The other reason is that my husband said it was way too bitter and sour for his liking. (My 17 mo. old liked it!) Once I picked the bits out I thought the relish looked much better. There was also some orange \"flesh\" that didn't chop up that I had to pick out. Next time I think I will add some OJ and orange zest instead of chopping up an entire orange. We'll see how it goes over on Thanksgiving! Thanks Lisa.",

But with 15 adults every bit was eaten or taken as leftovers so it was a hit. I used only the outside skin (the orange part without the white) of about 1/2 of an orange and it was plenty - so I recommend not using a whole peel like others have done. I think you could probably experiment with this by adding diced apple and /or pear too. I will definitely make this again for next year's Thanksgiving - thanks for the great recipe!",

I cleaned the seedless orange really well with a commercial fruit wash first cut off both end tips and cut out the middle \"strings\" - then had no problem pulverizing it in my food processor. After the cranberries were cooked (and the sugar melted) - I added the rest of the ingredients to the pan - and added 1 tbsp of pure maple syrup - and cooked it for a further 4 minutes on low/medium heat. Came out great - you could add more maple syrup if you want it sweeter...but cook it for a little longer. Will go great with our Thanksgiving meal tomorrow!! Would love to try this over baked brie...... Thanks for the great recipe!!",
