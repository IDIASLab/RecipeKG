I was able to use all the greens from my garden. Though I did make a couple minor substitutions - I used beet greens instead of chard because that's what I had growing. And I used a regular orange instead of a clementine omitting the orange juice in the dressing. Finally I used celery salt instead of celery seed and salt separately. The biggest surprise was how great the olives interacted with the rest of the ingredients. Fabulous! Each of the four servings this makes is pretty large. Add a hunk of meat fish or a bean patty and you have a great summer meal.",
