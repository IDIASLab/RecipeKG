My Russian Jewish Great Grandma made hers with whole chicken celery parsnips turnips carrots onions dill and \"flanken\" (I later learned that flanken = short ribs). You only use a few pieces of the short ribs to give it some added depth & flavor. For me dill is the most important ingredient for without it it simply doesn't taste like Jewish Chicken soup.
