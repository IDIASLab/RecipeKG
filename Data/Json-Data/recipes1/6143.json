Don't get me wrong I enjoy making my homemade mac and cheese but we also are fans of 'the blue box' and this was a great way to dress it up! I think next time I may add either some shredded cheddar or buttered breadcrumbs to the top before baking just because. This will definately be made again! Thanks for sharing.:)",

I'd add more--maybe some peas more tomato and more pepper plus those spices. This makes a ton so be prepared to 1/2 it feed a lot of people or have a lot of leftovers.
