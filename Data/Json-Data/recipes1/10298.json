I could not for the life of me find ranch-style beans (perhaps one of the many products we don't get in Canada) and couldn't really find anything close either. I ended up using BBQ beans and rinsing most of the BBQ sauce off of them. That ended up being alright but there was a bit of a BBQ-y taste with the dressing (not necessarily a bad thing - we still ate it). I think next time (and there will have to be a next time because my dad loved this.. even took leftovers for lunch the next day which he NEVER does not even when it's something he cooks) I would just use plain beans and try to jazz up the dressing in a different way. A lot of reviewers mentioned using ranch dressing - I liked the Thousand Island but I wonder how it'd be with a little of each?",
