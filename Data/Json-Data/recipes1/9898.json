I mix all the ingredients together and bring to a quick boil (on the stove) to allow the sugar to disolve, then cool the marinade (before placing fish in).  I have also substitued orange marmalade for the ginger and it turned out just as good.  If you marinade the fish overnight it gives it a more powerful flavor.  The leftover fish is also excellent the next day and served cold - I have used on top of salad.",

It's got a nice bit of zip from the ginger and mustard. The sugar adds a great contrasting sweetness. It's our favorite salmon recipe! Added note: You may want to tweak the marinating time depending on how strong you want that flavor to be vs the salmon flavor. I've always let in marinate longer than the suggested time but crossed the line when I went for 6 hours. Too long! Now we marinate it for 1-2 hours usually.",
