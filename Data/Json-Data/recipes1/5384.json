I took ground mild italian sausage and made mini meat balls with them ground them and set them aside while I did the veggies. I added about a 1/2 cup of white wine with the veggies lots of salt some oregano parsley and basil and used a can of italian stewed tomatoes (drained) instead of fresh. Topped it off with shreded parmesean and it was a hit! My husband and our dinner guests loved it. I'll definately make it again.",
