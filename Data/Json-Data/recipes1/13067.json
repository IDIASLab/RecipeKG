I went with Amanda's idea and added 1/2 cup of water to the soup mix. It just didn't look like it was going to be enough of it to add to the mixture. Now I did cook it in the crockpot but turned the heat up to high and it only took 4 hrs to cook. Next time I'll add other veggies like carrots or even broccoli to it. I think the type of ham you use also decides the saltiness. Mine hardly had any salt in it and I think thats what made the difference on the flavor. Was very filling.",
