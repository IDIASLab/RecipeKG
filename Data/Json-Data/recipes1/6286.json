Put 3/4 milk in instead!  Mix soup w/1 minced garlic clove, 1/8 tsp onion powder, a tiny pinch of ginger - you don't want too much, cause it's potent, & 1/8 tsp italian seasoning.  And then, skip layering everything!  Just stir it all in the bowl that you stirred the soup in, it's a lot easier!...But put the cheese on top.  & just a note -- I didn't have stuffing mix, so I just crumbled corn flakes on top, then sprinkled italian style breadcrumbs! That'll make it a 5-star recipe for ya!",

I also used a whole box of stuffing mix and cooked it before topping it on the casserole and added sauteed mushrooms in the mix.  It was good but needed some tweaking\n\nThe second time around was a hit.  My boyfriend said he liked it better than the first and my sorority sisters inhaled the dish at our potluck last night.  One sister told me it was the best casserole she'd ever had and another has already asked for the recipe...the trick is instead of topping the casserole with the cheese and stuffing, mix it ALL together.  Then I topped the whole thing with bread crumbs.  It was so much better than with the stuffing on top.  Oh yeah...and I added yet ANOTHER cup of cheese.  Needless to say, no more tweaking is necessary.  \n\nAwesome, and thanks so much!",

I took a little advice from other users to make it better.  I used approximately 1/2 of a leftover roasted chicken, 1 bag of mixed frozen broccoli, cauliflour, & carrots(instead of just broccoli), 2 cans cream/chicken soup(in place of 1 can cream/mush), 3/4 cup milk (in place of mayo), and 1 cup bread crumbs mixed w/2 Tbls. melted butter for the topping (instead of stuffing).  I also added 1/2 tsp. chopped garlic, 1/8 tsp. onion powder, 1/8 tsp. Italian seasoning, and 3 shakes of cumin to the soup/cheese mixture.  Everyone in the house raved about this dish!  It fed one hungry husband, two hungry teenage boys, and 1 hungry mom...with a little left over for lunch tomorrow. :)  \nThis recipe is a keeper!  \nBon Appetite!",

I boiled the chicken with a can of chicken broth 1/2 a can of cream of chicken soup and a little bit of water. I also added some chopped garlic salt and pepper to the boiling water. Once boiled I cut the chicken into cubes. I then combined the boiled mixture with the mayo the cream of mushroom soup and mixed in the cubed chicken. I also mixed in the broccoli. I followed the recipe from that point. Others have posted that the chicken was bland and dry but if done this way you'll have great results.",

This is what I did:  I used 2 cans cream of chicken instead of 1 cream of mushroom, I used half a can of milk instead of mayo, I used chopped broccoli (comes frozen), and I cooked the stuffing mix before placing it on the casserole.  I also mixed the soup, milk, chicken and broccoli before placing in casserole dish.  I covered it with the cheese and then the cooked stuffing.  It was good this way, but i will make some changes...I will use more cheese (maybe 2 cups), 2 cans of cream of mushroom, and use 2 boxes of stuffing mix instead of one.  My 5 year old said he wanted more of the bread and i agreed.  Oh, I boiled the chicken in chicken broth with a bay leaf.  This is a good, quick meal.  I am making a meal for a woman at my church next week and I will use this recipe.",

First thing I did was boil chicken broth, water, chicken cube and two crushed garlic cloves to a boil. I added about six frozen chicken strips to the water and boiled for 10 minutes. While that was cooking I sauteed half a onion and about 4 cloves of garlic in evoo, then added one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of broccoli to the onions an garlic and reduced to low. when the chicken was done, i scooped it out and placed it on paper towles to drain. Then added a bag or frozen broccoli,califlower/carrot mix to the chicken stock and boiled for a few minutes. I shredded the chicken added it to the cream of chicken mixture along with the drained veggies. mixed it all up then put it in the baking pan with the cheese topping and crackers. OMG! SOOOO GOOD!! Thanks for this, I've never made casserole before and this was just the perfect recipie to get me going!!!",
