I also omit the topping, just because I never seem to have crushed cornflakes, and it is perfectly fine w/o. Here's a tip on how to get it to mix better.  Make sure hash browns are thawed as per recipe instructions. Pour melted butter/margarine over the potatoes and mix.  Then add the cheese and mix.  Lastly add the rest of the ingredients.  It seems to mix faster and better for me this way.  It does need the full hour to cook or your onions will be crunchy.  I usually divide this in half between 2 smaller casseroles, eat one for dinner and freeze the other.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Update: 15/02/07 - Tried the suggestion of putting french fried onions on top instead of the cornflakes - absolutely awesome! Don't put in at the start though...put in last 10-15 min and cook uncovered (watch as they burn easily), I sprinkled some extra cheese on top with the onions and it was really good!",

Also since I only had half a cup of cheddar cheese, I shredded an additional cup & a half of processed cheese. I used mushroom soup instead of chicken, and I didn't have cornflakes, so nothing but a sprinkle of parmesan cheese went on the top. I also left off the additional 1/4 cup melted butter, and since the processed cheese is so salty, I only used 1/4 teaspoon salt. It was a delicious main dish and would make an excellent breakfast casserole. Our family of 3 had generous portions and only ate half the casserole. My husband, who never likes leftovers and is not crazy about anything in a casserole, loves the leftovers.",

Secondly, defrost the hash browns totally before cooking. Third, sautee the chopped onion in 4 tbl. butter for about 3-4 minutes before adding onion mixture to the hash browns.  Fourth, use shredded colby cheese, not cheddar!  Cheddar is far too greasy, and that is part of the reason why some people think this is too soupy.  Fifth, bake covered at 350 for about 45 minutes then remove the foil and bake uncovered for about 45 more minutes.  The casserole will only slightly brown on top, it is unlikely to burn.  You may also want to turn the heat up to 375 if you think it is too soupy.  It will condense if you give it long enough to cook.  If you do all of the above, it will taste almost exactly like the Cracker Barrel's hash brown casserole.  Be sure to let it cool for about 10 minutes after it comes out of the oven as well, as that helps it solidify.",

The other change I think I'll make is to bake the hash brown potatoes prior to placing them into the casserole and maybe the potatoes can cook better.",
