I served it with fresh whipped cream and crystallized ginger. I have a feeling that this would make fabulous muffins. This has a very strong pumpkin flavor (which I lurve).

This variation appealed to me in that the spice was limited to just cinnamon, a welcome change from the usual additions of pumpkin pie spice, allspice, ginger, nutmeg and/or cloves. Other than baking these as cupcakes, about 22-23 minutes, I prepared the recipe as directed, using a 15-oz. can of pumpkin rather than measuring out 2 cups.  One recipe made 24 cupcakes.",
