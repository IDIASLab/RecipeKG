Added chopped celery (carrot sticks and celery sticks were purchased together already cut at WalMart) 3.) Added 2 cups of diced potatoes 4.) Added two tsps. of garlic and approx. 1 tsp. of the following: basil oregano thyme black pepper and seasalt as well as 2-3 bay leaves. 5.) Left out the ketchup as I was confused as to \"why\" to use it 6.) Tossed everything in the crock pot with 8 cups of water (per the original recipie) and let cook (KEEP TEMP LOW!!!!)for 7 hours. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS AND NUTRICIOUS!!!!!! However the morning after eating the soup I realized my system was apparently ill-prepared to break down the beans so I decided to add 7 drops of BEANO to each new serving (which solved the problem...) Will probably make at least twice a month from now on!",

I also set out a bottle of ketchup for those who prefer it instead of adding it directly to the mix.

Also I combined everything in my crock pot and cooked on low for 6 hours.....therefore no boiling...so easy & so good with cornbread!",
