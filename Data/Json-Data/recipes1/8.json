I would like to add a few suggestions: If not all covered in hot lard or oil, patties will drop off mold. If eggs are beaten too light, blisters or bubbles will form with fat, making patties greasy. If patties are soft & not crisp, they were made to fast, cook alittle slower. If patties do not slip off the mold easily, put back in fryer, the dough is not cooked enough next to the mold. ",

                "reviewBody": "I teach Norwegian cooking classes, so I thought I would add a few tips:\n\nflavoring:\n- you can substitute lemon extract for the vanilla\n\nSugaring:\n- do not add sugar until you are ready to serve, they get soggier if they have sugar on them when stored.\n\n- some people prefer sugar, some powdered sugar, others sugar and cinnamon.  If you use powdered sugar, use a sifter so it doesn't plop on, but goes on smoothly.\n\n- some people sugar the bottoms, other the tops.  it does look a bit fancier if you flip them upside down and sugar them that way- (which is not the way it is pictured)- the sugar then catches to the edges and makes for more contrast in the color.  I grew up doing it the way it is pictured here, but after you flip, you won't go back because they look so much better.\n\nIf you are having trouble with rosettes, note the following:\n\nSoggy rosette? It should be fairly crisp as soon as it is slightly cool. Your fat may be too cool or you are not frying long enough. Also, make sure you aren't letting it cool on it's back.  The oil needs to drain off the edges.\n\nLots of blisters on your rosette?  You over beat your eggs.\n\nIs the rosette is falling off iron while in in the oil? You aren't putting your iron deep enough into the oil.  Add more oil to the fryer or place lower in fryer. But, don't hit the bottom, it will burn the rosette.\n\nCan\u2019t get the rosette off the iron? Remove with a knife.  You may have dipped it too deep in the batter.",

I did have a little trouble with the batter falling off the iorn, called my mother and immediately had an answer! Place a kitchen towel or napkins next to your hot oil pot or pan and after dipping the iorn into the hot oil, pat it flat onto the towel and then dip into the batter and sure enough no more fallen batter. I also like using my blender to blend both the sugar and cinnamon together and make it a little more softer for dusting at the end. Thank you for the recipe!",

Here are some of my notes, based on my experience making this particular recipe: 1.\t375 degrees is WAY too hot!!!  The rosettes are burned before you can get them off the iron.  We found that 350 is about right.\n2.\tDip the iron in the batter and hold there for about 4 seconds, then let batter drip off slightly, then put iron into oil.\n3.\tHold iron under the oil for about 12 seconds;  that way, dough will come off the iron easier.\n4.\tDo sift flour;  this will keep the batter smooth.  However, you will need to add more flour to keep the batter from being too thin.  (The recipe as written is much too thin \u2013 not enough sticks to the iron, and what does stick fries up too quickly.)\n5.\tBe sure to stir batter every so often to keep it from getting too thick at the bottom.",
