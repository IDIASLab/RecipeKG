I also added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg b/c of the reviews that said it might need it! Think it made it great! I also did not use the nuts b/c I'm not a fan of nuts in my pumpkin bread! Also instead of loafs I did mini muffins b/c that is the way my kids like them and they are easier to take places (I'm taking them to church for our youth department tonight) They only take about 12 to 15 minutes that way and yielded almost 10 dozen or so!!!

I used butter in place of the margarine half brown and half white sugar and only a small amount of walnuts. I used two mini loaf pans and divided the batter and cooked at 325 for 45 minutes. The cream cheese did make the bread dense and moist. But I felt it lacked good pumpkin and spice flavor. I may try adding nutmeg and more cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice next time",
