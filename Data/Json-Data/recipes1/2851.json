My family does not like SWEET sweet potatoes so I omitted the corn syrup in step 2 and used the juice of a whole orange instead. In step 3 I drained the potatoes after cooking without saving any liquid since I did not need it. I prepared the potatoes ahead of time and put them into a casserole with the orange juice sauce and pieces of oranges. I also added 1/2 c. chopped pecans. I covered the dish and heated the dish in the oven (350) for about 1/2 hour instead of finishing on the stove-top.",
