Used 4 large caps,  1/2 cup of ricotta and a cup of shredded cheese blend.  Filled them up and topped them off with a lil sprinkle of cheese and the balsamic.  Cooked about 20 minutes for the mushroom to cook.  SO GOOD!!!  the balsamic adds such a great flavor!!  We used this as a mean instead of a side, which is why we chose the large caps and alot of meat.  Forgot the tomatoes so just left them out.  \nHighly recommend this recipe!  Especially with my own personal touches = )",
