I was craving 'loaded mashed potatoes' like they serve at some of the chain restaurants but was tired, busy and in a hurry so in an effort to eliminate some steps I tried seasoning my mashed potatoes with Montreal steak seasoning (my favorite slow cooker seasoning!) and threw in some cream cheese and shredded cheese for a super easy treat that the whole family raved over.

It was the addition of the Montreal Steak Seasoning however that caught my eye and made this really interesting. Great addition although I wasn't comfortable using the full amount called for and cut it in half - neither did I use any additional salt. Hubs and I agreed both were a good call. I added green onion which these potatoes seemed to cry out for and it added great fresh flavor as well as color. These potatoes alongside of \"Sunday Meatloaf \" also from this site made for a perfect \"comfort food\" meal.",

I'm not sure I like them alone but they might be good with the Bottom Round Roast with Onion Gravy. I'll update after we have dinner and try them together. EDITED: My husband remarked on how this tasted like a steakhouse baked potato and how he loved it. Just for that I'm making it again. Thank you for the recipe. It went well with the roast.",

These are very rich so definitely not an everyday side but nice every once in a while. I left out the salt bc with the steak seasoning bacon and cheese I figured it would be plenty salty. I am so glad I left out the salt as it was perfect without. After eating I glanced at the steak seasoning jar and noticed the first ingredient is salt--so test it first before adding the salt. If you think it's not salty enough then go for it. Very filling and good with the Montreal Peppered Steak that is also on this site. Thanks for the recipe!",
