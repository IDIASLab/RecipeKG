                "reviewBody": "Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I had cleaned out my pantry today and found several large cans of peaches. I seldom use canned peaches but I wanted to use at least a can of them so I turned to allrecipes.com to find a recipe for something quick and simple I could take to church tonight to share. I knew I didn't have the time to make crust and I needed to use ingredients I had on hand. I have tasted other \"cobblers\" made with similar type toppings (not crust per se) and have usually found them just \"okay.\" I followed the recipe as written (exception -- only had reduced-fat Bisquick) baked it in a glass dish (still at 350) and for 50 minutes. It turned out really well and it was a genuine hit at church. I found it very good -- not quite as good as a \"real\" cobbler with fresh peaches and home-made crust but a very close second. Taste alone might have earned it four stars but the ease of preparation earned it that fifth star. (One note -- I was afraid I had done something wrong when the batter turned out quite thin -- but it worked really well.) The dessert was also nice and golden brown and attractive to serve. Thanks again!",

Also I used peaches in heavy syrup and used only half of the sugar instead of the 2/3 cup of sugar. Also I used regular milk instead of buttermilk and the crust portion turned out fine!
