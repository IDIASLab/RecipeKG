I used 5 cups fresh french bread, cut out one of the eggs, and did what an earlier reviewer suggested: use half brown sugar and half white sugar, and I used half milk and half cream. I also sprinkled some raisins on top as an after thought. It turned out great because the people who don't eat raisins can just pick them off instead of digging for them. I used a regular 8x13 brownie pan on just my oven rack, no water bath, reduced the temp and baked for well over an hour. (If I even get a hint of egg taste, I won't eat it...this doesn't taste like eggs.)Marvelous recipe! I always bake it when the kids are sleeping and hide it so I don't have to share. I'm greedy!",
