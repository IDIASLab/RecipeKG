I scaled the recipe to eight however I did use a whole pound of shrimp. The scaled down version asked for 3/4 of a cup of butter to make the roux. I felt that this was a little too much fat so I halved the amount of butter and flour and it was fine. Instead of fish stock I used the shrimp broth from previous shrimp cocktail appetizers that I had frozen and saved for this occasion. To cut down on the fat even further I boiled my shrimp instead of sauteeing and I used fat free half and half in lieu of heavy cream. I suggest straining the soup before you add your cream. Delicious! My whole family enjoyed this very much. Thanks!",
