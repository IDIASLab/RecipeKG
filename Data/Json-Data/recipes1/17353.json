One cup of each ingredient is added so it is easy to remember and fun to make with kids. If you are serving all the kin folk simply add two or three cups of each ingredient. Some folks also add whatever berries are in season to make it sweeter and more colorful for kids.",

The adults were more into it but the thoughts was the coconut dried the salad in the tastebud department...now the kids...well this wasn't as kid friendly as I had hoped. While I KNOW all the kids love all the ingredients...but the coconut. So I tried again making it without the coconut. And then they liked it a little bit better. But complained it wasn't sweet enough for them. And the youngest out of the bunch only ate the pineapple. So go figure. Sorry for the poor rating. Maybe whipped topping would be better and sugar coated cornflake cereal.",
