I first read the reviews then changed the recipe as follows.\r\n\r\nInstead of sour cream I used leftover gravy.\r\nI also used leftover gravy to make my dressing.\r\nI used one \"light\" tablespoon of onion soup mix.\r\nI added an extra can of green beans to make the casserole thicker,doubled the turkey and doubled the dressing.\r\nLast, I sprinkled canned french fried onions on top of the casserole about ten minutes before it finished. It cooked it four almost an hour. My family loved it!  Can easily feed six to eight people.",

We actually enjoy the casserole the next day more then the typical turkey day meal.",

I personally don't think it matters which one.  I used a reduced fat soup and fat free sour cream.  I don't like canned vegetables and didn't have green beans on hand, so I used a package of frozen, mixed vegetables (cooked before placing in the casserole).  In the last 5 minutes of baking, I topped the casserole with french fried onion rings and shredded, low fat chedder cheese.  My husband and I LOVED it!  This is definitely a keeper.",

I followed the recipe to a tee and did think this was on the soupy side also.  However I served my casserole with mashed potatoes which seem to be the casserole's perfect match for the extra soupiness.  The potatoes also help cut back on the saltiness of the dish too.  Will definitely make again!",
