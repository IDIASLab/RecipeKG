Wanting a stronger flavor for some of them I also used the the Orange Cream Cheese Frosting from this site which was fantastic. My changes: I used butter flavored shortening (that's all I had) and I after reading other reviews I doubled the orange zest as well. My batch also made a little over 6 dozen. I did scooped them with a cookie scoop right out of the bowl - no refrigerating no rolling no cutters. I'm not a \"pretty cookie\" maker. Also please remember this is NOT a super-sweet cookie. Not all cookies should cause cavities. This one is a little different a little special and very very easy. That's 5 stars in my book. Thanks for the recipe!",

They also baked very nicely and were very tender to eat. Not very sweet so they do need an icing. I will probably turn this into my new \"holiday cookies for school\" recipie.",
