I have to say though that the video that accompanies this recipe is right next to useless for showing how to grill this pizza so unless you want to watch an advertisement for Reynolds Wrap you can skip the video and go right to making and trying this pizza. Will definitely be making these pizzas again so thanks for posting.",

No problem grilling it by keeping the heat moderate...just keep it in longer. I also do this in the oven at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes. I have frozen it after the pizza was grilled or baked and it turned out well as it thawed while baking in the oven. A real keeper!",
