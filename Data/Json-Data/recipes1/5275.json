The bacon was still softer than it would be on the grill I may make in the oven again but think it's best suited for grilling as written. The two bacon slices to wrap the breast secured it really well. I added cheese inside but it melted out: if you want cheese with it I'd suggest serving it shredded on top almost like on a baked potato. The slight issue I have is with the chopped peppers/garlic/onions I really feel the flavor and texture would improve if you give them a quick saute together and then put on. The bits are so protected by the bacon/chicken/sausage they crunch and taste like they are still raw. Thanks for sharing.",
