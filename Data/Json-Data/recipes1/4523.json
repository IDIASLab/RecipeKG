I had about 6 tortillas left that day from the chicken so gave it a try.  Have also used thick plum pulp and everyone raved about the dumplins.  This is a great way to use up some of the fruit or juice we have left from last years canning or freezing.  It is so easy to do, and best of all, no mess. Fresh, frozen or canned apricots may be used for this recipe.",

Don't berate the recipe for being sweet if it is a dessert. Just adjust to your tastes. This is a keeper.",
