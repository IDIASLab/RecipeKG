This recipe is great with any fresh, large sausage (just not the wee breakfast-style sausages). Sometimes I use sweet Italian, sometimes spiced Italian, sometimes bratwurst, sometimes knockwurst, and sometimes just local pork sausage. Serve in buns with all the usual fixin's (sauerkraut, mustard, relish, etc.).",

Next time I will chop the prunes up more fine so they don't come out in big clumps. I can't eat buns though (no bread stuff) so I just had it with a side of cabbage. Fantastic dinner. It was a bit dry though but still I am putting this in my recipe inbox.",
