I almost goofed up and put more liquid in because of all the reviews that siad it was dry- almost, but I decided to make it just like the recipe said the first time. THANK GOODNESS, i did. IT was NOT dry. It was PERFECT, moist. I pre-cooked and drained my ground beef.  I used minute rice. I used the exact ingrdients in the recipe- it was moist AND tasty. I can not figure out how someone could have made this and thought it was dry and/or bland. It was popping with flavor. I think that the bowl you use is probably important. A 2 quart casserole dish is small, and that is what I used, a round, clear glass one. So that in the center of my casserole the mixture was about three inches high. That could be why mine was moist and delicious. If you use a bigger panm (ex.9 x 13) you would spread it out very thin and it would probably get dry...",

Bake for 1/2 hour more and you have a super-easy meal.",

We took the advice of one of the reviewers and broke up the ground beef in tiny little bits, in a huge mixing bowl.  Then we added salt and fresh ground pepper to taste and some dehydrated green onion, which has a sharper flavor than fresh.  Added the rice, and mixed it in well.  Then the vegetables.  Tasted it again.  In a separate bowl we mixed the soups and half and half. Tasted again and added some nutmeg and beef base. We poured the liquid mix into a glass casserole dish and then added the ground beef/rice mixture, covered it and popped it into the oven and checked it's progress at 1 hour and it was a bit soupy.  We left it in for an additional 15 minutes and it came out moist and flavorful.  We topped it with Kerrygold Dubliner cheese and ate it with Bread Machine Challah I.  The recipe can be found on this website.  Ultimate Ease, Ultimate Yum, Easy Clean-up.",
