I usually just don't rate, but I was really craving shoo-fly pie, and I was so disappointed with this one.  I ended up throwing it out after one slice.  It could be an okay pie, but I don't consider this shoo-fly pie.  I think the best recipe on  this site is Grandma's shoo-fly pie (you have to hyphenate the shoo-fly to find it on this site).  It uses shortening instead of butter and an egg. The consistency is not right, and neither is the crumb topping.  I'm from Lancaster, too, and I've never had a shoo-fly pie with this consistency before.  Guess I'll be back in the kitchen making a different one tonight.",

I actually used a graham cracker crust as it was all I had and I think it absorbed a lot of the liquid so it came out more like a cake but still wonderfully sweet! (Note when using an 8\" pie plate cut down the recipe to about 2/3 of all the ingredients listed ie. 1 cup=2/3 cup etc.) I will use the unbaked crust next time and I'm sure it will come out just as good. Don't be alarmed if the layers aren't quite layers. I alternated layers like the recipe describes but it ended up looking like a bunch of crumb topping mixed with the liquid molasses mixture. It still came out great! I agree with the other reviews Shoo Fly Pie is the best pie EVER!",

BUT I made this recipe and I swear he ate half the pie! Very easy to make quite tasty and although mine didn't look very much like the picture it was still good. I didn't know how to tell when the pie was 'done ' and figured when the goo started pouring over the edge I should take it out. It left the bottom part a little gooey but I really like that.
