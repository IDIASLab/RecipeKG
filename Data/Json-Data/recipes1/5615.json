I used brown rice because it is healthier and cooked it seperately in low sodium, fat free chicken broth.  To the broth I added cumin, tumeric, garlic powder and onion salt to flavor the rice as it cooked.  In another pot, I sauteed sweet onion and garlic in 1 tbs of olive oil.  After veggies became translucent, I added 1 (10 oz) can of tomatoes and green chilis and 1 (15oz) can of drained black beans and heated through.  After rice was cooked, I tossed the bean/tomato mixture in with the brown rice and added a splash of lime juice. As condiments, you may want to add a dollop of low fat sour cream and/or low fat cheddar cheese.  Very tasty and healthy meal. Deb, Georgia",

The one I used called for draining & rinsing the beans, adding 2 minced garlic cloves (instead of garlic powder), adding 2/3 cup water & using 1 and a half cups of instant brown rice (instead of one cup white rice).  Instead of stewed tomatoes, I used diced tomatoes & just added some garlic powder, onion powder & basil.  This last time I added a dash of cayenne too & a little leftover slivered cooked chicken.  It's fine meatless though.  It's a nice meal to make when you don't have something defrosted & want something quick, easy & nutritious.",

I did not add rice but cooked rice separately and served the rice with the beans on the side. For the beans I thoughly drained and rinsed the beans to get rid of the tin taste. I used 1/2 of a very large fresh vine-riped tomato 1/4 of a green pepper 1/2 onion 1 clove minced garlic. All veggies were finely chopped except for tomatoes which were bigger. I used extra virgin olive oli to saute the garlic and onion. I then added green peppers and tomatoes with salt and fresh ground pepper. I added black beans a bit of water and chopped 1 slice of ham (omit if you're vegetarian). I used basil oregano paprika and cayenne for flavor. I ended up adding about 1/2 cup of water. add more water if you want. I let it simmer for about 5 min. in low heat. I'm eating it right now with a bowl of rice some sliced avocado cheese and fresh tomatoes. Oh my god it tastes so good!!!",
