Instead of a baguette I used a larger softer bakery bread which worked beautifully.  (I sometimes find the baguettes too hard anyway)  For the goat cheese I had to substitute feta which I mixed with a bit of plain yougurt to make it more spreadable.  Next I added a layer of thinly sliced salami to bump up the protein for my kids, put the tapenade on next... then the grilled veggies and last I put slices of gouda because with the little ones I knew the parmesan would be a disaster.  I also put it under the broiler to melt the cheese.  I know I changed the recipe a little, but nothing that comprimised it too much in my oppinion.  *ALSO* While the veggies were under the broiler, I started the tapenade in the food processor and it zipped together!  This was a great lunch for all of us!  (parents, 3yr. old & 1.5 yr. old)",

                "reviewBody": "This sandwich is amazing! I'm giving it a four only because I added some ingredients and it took me forever to find tapenade. Like some other reviewers I had never heard of it before and wasn t even sure if I was pronouncing it right lol. Your regular grocery store like S&S won't have it but Trader Joes or Whole Foods will. Trader Joes had it in plastic containers in the refrigerated section in with the hummus etc. You can also find a few different jarred varieties as well at TJs. If all else fails you can find recipes for it (with and without anchioves) on this site. What I did first was salted and sweated baby eggplant slices for 30 mins in a colander and dapped with a paper towel to remove excess moisture and brushed very litely with olive oil. I then saut\u00e9ed some garlic in a small amount of olive oil and added the red peppers and onions. Once they were tender I removed them and kept warm while I did the eggplant. I only flipped them once but made sure the pan didn t get too hot as to burn them. I warmed goat cheese on the bread under the broil (on low) and then spread on the tapenade. Then I layered grilled baby eggplant red peppers and red onions. I topped with provolone cheese and melted under the broil. Finally I finished it all off with some fresh basil leaves. By far the best sandwich I've ever made! Don't let the ingredients scare you off! The tapenade doesn t overpower the sandwich so I would recommend at least spreading a tiny bit on.",
