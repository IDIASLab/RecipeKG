I used a fat free half and half since it was what I had on hand. That may have given a slightly less creamy texture. Nothing is better in the fat free version! lol! Next time I will also cut the amount of curry in half and use chicken stock instead of vegetable. Good recipe though!",

This soup is far better than the ever-popular Creamy Chicken & Wild Rice Soup from this site - and just as easy in my opinion. I added about 2 cups of cooked diced chicken to this because I made it for someone who needs a lot of protien in her diet - but it's also wonderful as is. Thanks!!",

What I don't know bc he told me \"you never make anything twice so what do you care?\" I guess I've been making too many different things. Oh well. Onward more AR recipes to try! If I do come back to this maybe add some chicken and more veggies. Thanks for the recipe!",
