Sticking is no longer a issue at all.  After they look done I turn the oven off and leave the brownies in the oven as it cools.  This helps with the gooeyness.  I also vary the chips I use.  Choc.,white choc., butterscatch, candy bar bits...They all work well in this recipe.  I also like to cut the recipe in half and put it in a samller pan(8*8) for a shorter cook time(start to check after about 15 min.).  Since it's hard not to eat them all gone right away, this helps me, since there is not as much to eat!  Give it a try, they are SOOOOOO good!",

I followed the advice of several of the other reviewers and made the following changes: I reduced the flout to 2 1/2 cups added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and baked it in a 9x13 pan for 40 minutes. The batter was sticky (which the kids liked!) but the blondies baked up nice and fluffy. This is an incredibly easy EXTREMELY delicious recipe. Thanks so much!",
