The changes I made from the recipe was using 1/2 cup softened butter 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar added 1/8th tsp ginger to the spices and soaking the raisins in apple cider before adding to the batter. I also used 3 eggs instead of 4. It just got out of the oven and while it is awfully crumbly right now I haven't even waited for it to cool properly yet and I'm sure it will firm up slightly while cool. I also drizzled a thin glaze made from powdered sugar and apple cider on while still warm but in truth it is sweet enough without it.",

This is a great recipe as is but today at work I adapted it to include some chopped apples and some leftover oatmeal from breakfast. We were short on butter so I substituted shortening we were short on raisins so I added some chopped apples as well and I wanted to use up the leftover oatmeal so I reduced the amount of milk and applesauce and dumped the leftovers in. The cake is nice and heavy moist and spicy and really smelled wonderful baking. It tastes delicious warm from the oven and I'm willing to bet it will be delicious cold too. Oh and I only used 1 teaspoon rather than 1 Tablespoon of baking powder.",
