An important thing is not to overcook. You want them to be tender but not falling apart; to shred better. I don't think it is neccesary to add oil, if you brown/crisp LONG ENOUGH before turning. I start out on medium-high heat then turn heat down to med, as soon as they start to brown. Then cook for about *20* minutes on ONE side, THEN TURN. I also like to \"cut\" (with the spatula) into serving size pieces prior to turning. I sometimes use another buttered pan to finish the other side (more room to turn). FYI; If you \"press\" down the potatoes at first, and brown/crisp for a long time, cut into serving sizes, they freeze well for reheating in the toaster later. Thank you, Denyse, for sharing. I prefer feeding my family *homemade* to oily, store bought with added preservatives.",

Also, when it came time to flip the hash browns, I placed a large plate over the frying pan, turned the pan upside down, and then slid the hash browns back into the pan.  Worked great and it came out in one, lovely, crispy, brown piece.  While it's hard not to peek, keeping the hash browns on the first side for at least 15-20 does make a huge difference in the amount of crispiness you will achieve.  Super recipe!  Thanks, Denyse!",

These tasted exactly, if not better than what we enjoy at our favorite diners here in Jersey. Denyse, your grandma certainly knew what she was doing because this was genius. Who would have thought to boil and refrigerate? Because I decided on this side just hours before dinner, I speeded up the process by placing the potatoes in the freezer until they were good and chilled. I did add sauteed chopped onion to this and some garlic and onion powders. I'll never, ever go back to the frozen stuff again!! Thank you so much!!!!",

Be careful not to overcook the potatoes, they are nearly impossible to shred if they are too tender.  I also just stuck them in the freezer for 30 min, instead of overnight and they were great!  I didn't have much luck getting them to stick together, but I plan on making these again and again.  I think next time I will try cooking these in the oven to make them extra crispy!  (will update after I try) UPDATE: Just tried baking these tonight...and HUGE success!  I greased a baking sheet, mixed about 1T flour in with the potatoes, and shaped them into round patties.  They cooked on 435 for 30 min (check for browness on bottom), then another 15 after flipping.  They were crispy and delicious!  Will bake these again and again--made our breakfast!",
