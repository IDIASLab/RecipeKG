Seriously good- I sprinkled almond flakes on top cut the cake in half and spread vanilla buttercream in the middle. I would maybe use 2 eggs next time for extra leavening since the batter was fairly thick anyway even for a pound cake. The cake was just a little denser than I'd like otherwise very yumyum!",
