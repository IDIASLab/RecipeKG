First thing I changed was I sauteed the beef sirloin strips  (had almost 1 lb) w/ onion (not onion salt) and garlic w/ a spash of worschester sauce and the green pepper slivers... for quite a while, like 45 mins. on med-low to make sure it was going to be tender. I added a little chili powder too for some spice. Then I added 1 cup of canned diced tomatoes w/ a little of the juice, quartered baby portabella  mushrooms and 3/4 a can of crm of chix soup.  I did not add any other liquid, it was pretty liquidy enough.  Simmered it for about 15 mins. topped w/ shredded mozz. chz. and served over rice.  Kids and their friends that were here ate it happily! Thanks for the post!  It was a comforting, familiar dish.",

Several others complained their meat was tough here's what I do to get tender sirloin every time saute the sliced meat with fresh garlic and whatever seasonings you like brown it for a few minutes and then add 1 cup of water 1 tsp. beef bouillon 1/4 cup Coke (yes Coke)! Cover and cook on medium-low for about 15 minutes! Once I did this I added the onions and green peppers covered and cooked for about 10-15 minutes longer. Meanwhile I stirred 1 can of diced tomatoes into the cream of mushroom soup. Then pour into skillet and heat through. I didn't even need to add the milk! This recipe was fantastic!",

Put the oil in my cast iron skillet and added those ingredients sauteed for about 10 mins. over med-low heat. Sprinkled some pepper chili powder worcestershire sauce and beef bouillon granuales over that and also added a can of golden mushroom soup and a can of diced tomatoes(omitting the juice) a little milk and about 3 Tblsps of cream cheese. Simmered for about 30 mins. Served over thin spagetti. A keeper will be making this again.",

I mixed the canned tomatoes and cream of mushroom soup together with a little more water and let it simmer for about 20 minutes longer. I served it over noodles and it was great.",
