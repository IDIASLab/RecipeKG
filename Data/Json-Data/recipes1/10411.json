I served these to my guests on Thanksgiving and they were impressed because of the wrapping but I ended up throwing a can of stewed tomatoes over them in the end to \"balance them out\". Also I don't think you need to pre cook if your going to marinate overnight. They would have turned out just fine if they were chilled with the marinade and then cooked a bit longer then recommended. Mine turned out a little burnt after following these instructions. Sorry",
