I also made two batches, one with 1c sugar and one with 1c Spenda as we wanted to see if there was a measurable difference in taste. Both batches were really marvelous!  Splenda seems to really do well as a sugar substitute when baking.  Took them to work thinking I would freeze any leftovers but couldn\u2019t because there weren\u2019t any.  A huge hit in the office although next time I will NOT use muffin liners.  Thanks for the delicious, low-fat, Weight Watcher friendly recipe!",

Instead of making the topping of chopped nuts and wheat germ, I just added about 1/2 cup chopped nuts to the mix.  I also used baking papers instead of greasing the tins.  They turned out soooo good!  I will make these over and over again, for sure!",
