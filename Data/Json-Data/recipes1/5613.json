First I mixed the pudding mix and cake mix together with a whisk.  Then I took out about 2 heaping tablespoons of the mix and tossed a 12 ounce package of butterscotch chips to keep them from sinking in the cake and folded in after I was done mixing all the other ingredients.  So we shall see and I will edit when done.  Also, subbed half of the water with vanilla nut creamer and added extra spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, ground clove).  The batter tasted bomb and I am hoping that transfers to the finished product.  I do plan on doing a cream cheese frosting with this cake and I will let you girls know.***on edit***The cake is delicious, I had to fight my hubby for a bite of his piece so I could finish my review ;-)",

I have really been trying to make all of my cakes from scratch but happened to have a spice mix and a package of butterscotch pudding. This blended together in a few minutes and smelled so good while baking. It came out very moist but the butterscotch flavor did not come through as much as I had hoped that it would. It just tasted like a spice cake to me. I drizzled a powdered sugar icing over it which did make for a pretty presentation.",

I poured in half the batter and added 2/3 cup butterscotch chips to it (so they wouldn't all end up on the bottom if I mixed them in before) then topped with the rest of the batter. You may have good results mixing them throughout; my batter seemed a little thin. I also made a butterscotch glaze for the top. I would also recommend trying a caramel or maple icing with this. It's great with the addition of chips and icing and goes well with coffee. The boyfriend liked it with the blend of spice and butterscotch. I could see that walnuts or pecans might be a nice addition. This cake also freezes well (well-wrapped) glaze and all. If I frosted it I may wait to frost it after it had dethawed.",
