I think maybe there was a typo in the recipe that they corrected as when I came across this recipe it says 18 servings which was perfectly reasonable. I added 3/8 teaspoon of cinnamon which made it even more yummy and reduced the sugar slightly as the dates made it sweet enough. Also I didn't \"roll between palms\" just cut into bars and let cool. Try this recipe! You won't regret it!",

I really want to try this with cranberries and pecans or raisins and walnuts. yum. Also I added in spices and vanilla to give extra flavor. Lastly I wasn't able to whip the egg whites to stiff peaks but I guess it didn't matter? The instructions about the egg whites were a bit confusing.",
