This is better than sour cream!  Creme Fraiche doesn't have the same holding power of sour cream as far as consistency goes, and it's not quite as sour.  But delicious it is!  I highly recommend that you try this!  Thank you, Chef John!",

This added a special finishing touch to the beef stroganoff and so easy to make. Thank you, Chef John.",
