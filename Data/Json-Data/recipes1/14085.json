Heating the pumpkin puree up takes out the \"canned\" taste of the pumpkin and melds the spices together nicely. Then, pour the mixture out into another bowl, and let it cool a bit before adding the condensed milk and eggs.  This little change makes the pumpkin taste much fresher!  My family loves this recipe, and I use a ready-made graham cracker crust, so easy and so good!",

This recipe is by far a 5 star!!  \r\n\r\nTips:  I did not use the ginger nor the nutmeg; instead I added 2 teaspoons of \"McCormik's Pumpkin Pie Spice\" (which includes: Cinnamon, Ginger, Nutmeg, and Allspice), along with the 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  My wife loved it but she thought it needed more cinnamon.  So I made the next one with 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and she loved it.  If you like a lot of cinnamon, that's the way to go.  For me, I preferred 1 teaspoon, but I'd eat it either way.\r\n\r\nThanks EAGLE BRAND\u00ae",

I used fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned pumpkin, which I would recommend because it is fresher and gives more texture.  Also, if you are using a homemade pie crust, I recommend you bake it a tad before adding the filling.  Otherwise, the crust will get mushy.  I cooked my pie for almost an hour (cooking time varies)and then, cooked for 15 minutes on the very bottom rack to finish the cooking of my crust while also lightly browing the top of the pie.  You end up with a perfectly spiced product, perfect with Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner (or anytime you crave it!).",

Stick with the other reviewers tips and us 2 teaspoons of McCormick's Pumkin spice instead of ginger and nutmeg, I also added one teaspoon of cinnamon and warmed up  the spices and pumkin on the stove on low heat, cooling than adding the eggs and sweetened milk, it really made the spices meld together great like the other reviewer said to do. I have NEVER baked before and was able to make this recipe just perfect.  **TIP**- Where it says bake 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees....take my advice and try this- bake it at 350 degrees (after you've done step 1 on directions of course) Bake it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes, than turn off your oven and set your timer for 5 minutes while you let the pie sit in there, this way it will still cook for an additional few minutes while the oven is off but still hot and this way the oven will cool enough so that you can let the pie cool off on the top rack the remainder of the time. Doing this will prevent the pie from cracking when it hits the cool air of the counter when it's still very warm. I topped it off with cool wip and graham cracker crumbs, great texture....Thanks EAGLE BRAND!!!",

                "reviewBody": "Absolutely delicious and the only recipe I ever use. I do add my own twist to this recipe, though. Firstly, I heat the canned pumpkin and spices on medium heat for a few minutes, to get rid of the canned flavor. Secondly, I use 2 teaspoons of McCormick's pumpkin pie spice, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom. I use one and a half 14 oz cans of condensed milk (I love that sweet, rich flavor - the extra condensed milk really adds an outstanding richness to this) instead of just one can, and 3 medium eggs (to compensate for the extra liquid). Even with the extra half can of milk, the filling fits in a standard 9 inch pie crust (I use a store-bought crust). I bake at 450 F for 20 minutes, and then I cover the top of the pie with aluminum foil, and then bake at 325 F for 1 hour. I then switch off the oven and let the pie cool in the oven for an hour, before I refrigerate it. Tenting with aluminum foil while baking prevents the crust from getting burnt, and letting the pie cool in the oven ensures that the top does not sink and that the center is cooked. This pie tastes best when made a day ahead and refrigerated overnight - this gives the flavors a chance to blend. I have forgotten to add salt before, and not noticed any difference. I have always received rave reviews about this - this recipe is a keeper !",
