I followed the recipe to a T, except that I substituted one small can of mandarine orange slices instead of one orange. It made prep super easy. For the dried fruit, I used the Sunmaid bits of fruit that include raisins, prunes, cherries and  apricots. Everyone at our Thanksgiving dinner loved this sauce. My mother asked for seconds and thirds! The recipe makes a TON, but it lasts in the fridge and only gets better as the flavors blend. I found myself craving it by the spoonful the days following Thanksgiving, so I would heat a few spoonfulls in the microwave until it was warm and ate it right out of the bowl. I am still eating it with cream cheese on bagels for breakfast every morning! This one will be a staple at my holiday table every year! The best way to describe it is that it tastes like \"fall.\" The yummy fall spices make this dish.",

I liked the recipe, it was more like a fruity dessert than a cranberry sauce, which was actually nice since some people don't like Cranberry sauce.  I would recommend that you half the sugar, cook the cranberries in a different pot, put the remaining pot of fruit in a food processor after cooked and then add the cranberries after processing.  This would give it more of a \"cranberry dish\" feel.  It is very tasty, but make sure to half the sugar....the fruit was more than enough sweet.",

I used about 1/2 the nuts called for dried cranberries cherries and apricots a whole (small) pear with a 1/2 an apple and added a pinch of ginger and some allspice in addition to the cinnamon.
