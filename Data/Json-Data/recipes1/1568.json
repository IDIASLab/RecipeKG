I gave our Head cook a copy of the receipe plus a large sample of the cake. She was very surprise afterr reading the receipe and then tasting the actual cake.

I had some maple granola I wanted to use so I sprinkled it over the top of each loaf before baking. Otherwise I made no other changes. I baked this divided into two loaf pans as to give them for gifts for Christmas. I'll update my review when I hear back how it went over. NOTE: One box of Softasilk cake flour is the perfect amount for six loaves of this cake 2 1/2 c. of flour for each batch. This is also good using buttermilk instead of evaporated milk if you ran out by the third batch like I did.",

Pleasantly sweet: somewhere between a bread and a cake so that you can eat a piece for breakfast or serve it after dinner (or... eat it for snack anytime!). Nice! Made a couple key changes... (1) Substitute 1 3/4Cup all-purpose flour 3/4Cup cornstarch (yes cornstarch!) for the 2Cups cake flour (which I never have!). Googled this substitute. (2) Increased vanilla to 1 tsp (1/2 tsp just not enough for this large batter... prob could have used even more!?). (3) 1Cup smashed bananas are approx. 3 medium. Good 'n black... that's what I say! (4) Chopped walnuts kind of small. (5) Used a greased 9\" x 13\" pan (didn't have a tube/Bundt pan! and decreased bake time by 7 mins and let cool in the pan. Really came out great!!",

I had everything called for in this recipe, so I happily mixed away.  Turned out perfectly baked in 45 minutes (amazing!  My oven NEVER bakes it at the time directed!) and was very moist and flavorful.  Doesn't need frosting or anything.  Hubs enjoyed, as did our dog (he loves bananas, and was begging . . .).
