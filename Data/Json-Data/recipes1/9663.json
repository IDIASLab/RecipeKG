I reduced the orange juice at a higher temp than recipe called for & I added a little bit of cornstarch mixed in cold water...it thickened up beautifully. I think that there was wayy too much chocolate (did I just say that?;o) ) & next time I will only melt 2 squares. I did not have bittersweet chocolate so I used semi-sweet instead. Also next time I think I will just halve & core the pears because that's easier. When all was said & done this was a very tasty dessert. The orange sauce was terrific & went really well w/ the chocolate & pears. Thanks!",

Prior reviewers noted that the sauce never thickened. I had some orange water on hand and substituted the sugar in the orange juice with this. The pears baked about an hour. Every ten minutes I turned them sprinkled a scant amount of sugar over them and basted with the orange juice drippings. They were finished baking before my guest arrived which was before dinner! I turned off the oven placed tin foil over the pears in the baking dish and left them in the oven to keep warm while we enjoyed dinner. About an hour later I took them out and the glaze was perfect just the right consistency.",
