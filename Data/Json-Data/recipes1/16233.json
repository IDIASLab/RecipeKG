I have to admit though I am not so sure if I threw this together I would neccessarily call it a printable recipe. It will give me a handy sheet for appetizer ideas in the future anyhow. I made a homemade coleslaw on the site. I bought the rolls suggested instead of making my own which saved a lot of time and I appreciated that. Although the rolls were super tiny. These are mini sandwiches. I usually make my own pulled pork in the summer but being as it is Super Bowl and winter I just bought some plain smoked pulled pork at Costco. I added in some Sweet Baby Rays original bbq sauce from a bottle and it worked fine. It took all of 20 minutes plus the time to cut the mini rolls in half fill them and hold them together with a toothpick. They tasted like they were from scratch to me. I liked the warm rolls.",
