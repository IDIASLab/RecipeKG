So I'm anxious to try again. Next time I'll make the batter the night before and keep in the refrigerator.",

I have always LOVED buckwheat pancakes but had to rely on the rare occasion when I could find them on a restaurant menu as buckwheat flour years ago was difficult to find on store shelves. That has changed and now that buckwheat flour is readily available I have enjoyed these pancakes at home. Don't expect them to be like buttermilk pancakes as the taste is entirely different. This is a GREAT recipe I've used for several years and I love the inclusion of the buttermilk. I just wish you could make buckwheat pancakes butter and syrup lo cal so we could enjoy these more often instead of as an occasional treat. Thanks for sharing your recipe Jessica!",
