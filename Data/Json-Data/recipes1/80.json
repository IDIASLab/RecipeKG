I did some just as written to be able to give an appropriate review then I added a bit more cereal to the dough and a touch more honey to get it easier to form into balls. Then I made them a bit smaller than called for and I rolled them in cocoa since they were so sweet. I like that it only uses honey and peanut butter for the sweetness both of which I love and always have really good of both on hand I will make these again.",

I did however do things a lil' bit different. I did not add the coconut flakes (don't like) but I did add a lil' bit of powder sugar to get them to stick a lil' better. I wish I would have had some vanilla to add unfortunately I didn't have any on hand. Will definately make these again. FYI have milk on hand!!!",

It is easy to make with/without children and has some \"healthy\" qualities to it. It is a sticky dough and clean up is sticky. Thanks for a great easy recipe to please young ones!",
