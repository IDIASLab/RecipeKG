This recipe will vary in taste and heat according to your curry paste. \n\nNotes about lentils: I have never cooked lentils before so I thought I would share some tips for others like me. \n\nFirst off, they are very small so don't try to use a strainer with larger holes (Yes, I know this is obvious). Rinse them well until the water runs clear.\n \nWet lentils stick to everything! Try to get them in the right pot the first time. I found a spatula was good for transferring them. \n\nRed lentils cook fast! I boiled mine for 2 mins then simmered for about 8 mins. At that point they were mostly tender. I transferred them into the sauce, mixed well and let them finish cooking. They didn't get too mushy like many people have mentioned.  ",

Then, tossed in the garlic and ginger; continued for about 1 more minute. Afterwards, I put the tomato and onions into the spice mix.  Then, added the lentils...  AWESOME!",

The ONLY thing I changed with the recipe was to replace the tomato puree with one can of Muir Glen Fire Roasted Chopped Tomatoes.  It gives it a much better texture and the fire roasted tomatoes just add another level of flavor that regular tomatoes don't.\n\nI can't believe how many people are making this without curry paste. It's the most important ingredient in a curry.  \n\nI serve it with jasmine rice and hot naan. Oh, and don't be alarmed if the lentils look rather mushy before you add them to the spices and tomatoes. You haven't done anything wrong, and they'll still taste just as good. :)",

I altered the recipe a bit to give it a more authentic flavor.\r\n-increased all spices, herbs, garlic, ginger, onions and curry paste by 2x.  kept sugar, salt amounts same\r\n-added ground coriander 1 tsp\r\n-added Garam  masala 1 1/2 tsp\r\n-added garlic powder 1tsp\r\n-added oniion powder 1tsp\r\n-tomato puree by 2X (entire can to make it moister, like authentic dhaal curries) then reduced it down a bit for added flavor\r\n\r\nAfter the additions and alterations my hubby really loved it\r\n\r\nAll and all I think this is a good recipe for someone who wants to give curry a spin without having to go out and buy the whole Indian grocery store (spices can be expensive!) it also allows for some room to play which is great.\r\n\r\nI'd definitely make this again\r\n-",

I over ate to the point of discomfort after loading up a big soup mug, and eating it with a heavy rustic bread and a big salad.    I did what was suggested by others........I doubled the garlic and sauteed the spices in a little oil, then added the ginger and garlic and sauteed for another minute before adding it all to the onions. Then I added the tomato puree and simmered it all together for awhile before adding the lentils.  My house smelled extremely pungent all afternoon and evening..........and I teach piano full time in my home........haha!!  I thought the consistency was just right after adding only about 1/2 cup of the water left in the saucepan from the cooked lentils.   I would like to add that Allrecipes has changed my cooking life dramatically.  I can find more ethnic dishes to try than ever before, and I make my final selections based on the reviews.  This is such a low-risk and wonderful way to try new dishes, and the recipes are all in a FREE \"cookbook\" loaded with ratings and suggestions!  I'm having a ball treating my family to the tasty results. ",
