I only greased the pan quite lightly, I can't imagine it was that.  Also, the cake rose wonderfully for 35 minutes or so and then began to sink.  It was only just browned on top when I took it out after about 42 minutes, and while it was cooked through it tasted very granular/grainy and was oily.  Some people thought it was \"OK\", some wouldn't eat it. I think you should look elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on what the problem might be? (Perhaps \"cake flour\" has two meanings, or something.)",

Any graininess/oiliness as noted by other reviews is probably due to the butter being closer to melted than room temp it will separate during mixing and cause problems. To fix chill the lemon juice before adding to re-firm the butter. The recipe doesn't say when to add the baking powder (!) so I suggest sifting it into the flour before adding the flour. Hint: if you don't have unsalted butter handy leave out the salt in the rest of the recipe.",
