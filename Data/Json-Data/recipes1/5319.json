This time I made sure to cut the celery and carrot pieces smaller than the onion so that they are all done at the same time. I also substituted some half-and-half for the chicken broth (1/4 of the portion) just to give it some richness and color. I added about 3/4 tbsp. of poultry seasoning and a dash of cayenne. I used frozen peas instead of canned and did not bake the biscuits with the casserole. I used frozen buttermilk biscuits and poured the mixture on top. I love the way that the biscuit melts when the sauce is poured on it. This time it came out DIVINE.",

Tastes considerably better with the bouillon cubes; either way, it's an excellent recipe, and nice to see a casserole without a can of soup in it, and also with so many fresh veggies.",

All in all, I prefer this better as is (i.e. with a biscuit crust), but had to give it a try...  This is an excellent recipe!!!  My friend who has the \"favorites\" cookbook recommended it to me (it's in the original paperback).  I do not like the \"crust\" part of pot pies, but I love the filling, so this recipe is perfect for me! The biscuits are just yummy!  I made this casserole for my parents and they loved it too!  I added some fresh mushrooms, pearl onions and a little cookig sherry (you could also use white wine...) to make it extra special :) I made more than 8 biscuits (8 didn't seem to be enough to cover the entire 9x13 pan) and didn't flatten them as the recipe directed (I just spooned heaping mounds of biscuit mix onto the filling). This dish pairs nicely with a tossed salad.  I'll definitely make this again. It's a keeper! Thanks for sharing!!!",

It was very good but next time I make this I'll use frozen peas instead of canned.  Some other reviews had mentioned there needed to be more biscuits so I used 3 cups Bisquit, 2 cups milk and two teaspoons basil. It made 12 good sized biscuits that covered the whole pan.  I didn't roll them as the recipe stated, I just did drop biscuits.  This was very good and will definately be made again. However, we had leftover since there's only two of us and the leftovers were not great, the biscuits soaked up the broth and it was just kinda dry, so I would suggest cutting the recipe in half, using a 9x9 inch pan if you're only making it for two people.",
