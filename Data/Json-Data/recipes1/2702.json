I also reduced the amount of wine to an 1/8 cup which I then reduced in the same pan as the onions and mushrooms. I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of cinnamon. A pinch of salt to enhance the sweetness. It's a nice side or topping. If you don't care for the sweetness of white then use red. This recipe is definitely for sophisticated taste buds.",
