I combined all of the wonderful advice of the cooks before me: use 1/2 butter and 1/2 Crisco for softness, use 1/2 dark and 1/2 light brown sugar for the best flavor, use less cocoa powder to keep more of a peanut butter flavor, and bake them for 6-8 minutes so they don't dry out. And the best advice of all was to use mini peanut butter cups, cut them in half, and freeze them before you put them in the cookie to bake.  This helps to maintain part of the candy shape and when you get to that center bite--well, you will see!!!  Thank you all for making me a cookie-making legend in my family!",

                "reviewBody": "I used the recommendations of halfbutter/half butter Crisco; WAY underbake. I use 38 - 40 mini Reese's peanut butter cups that I freeze, cut in half and then pop back into the freezer while preparing batter.  I cut them big because they look fabulous with that big gash of peanut butter.  Be careful when folding in the frozen cups and I try to keep those frozen pieces as large as possible - THAT is what makes these cookies so darn attractive and yummy.  I drop them out of a tablespoon - large - lumpy - I get 55 cookies to a batch.  Use parchment paper - keep them on the  sheet for 10 minutes or longer then off to the drying racks. (Again, they will kind of look raw, but keeping them on the pan, outside of the oven, for another 10 minutes or so continues the baking.)  These are KILLER; figuratively and, let's be honest, a bit literally!!!\n\nLATE ADDITION:  I NOW add the Trader Joe's teeny, tiny mini peanut butter cups to the recipe and use chocolate CHUNKS, instead of reg. chips. So, instead of the one cup chocolate chips and one cup peanut butter chips, I use a total of two cups chips, but split three ways with chocolate chunks, peanut butter and Trader Joe's chips.  ALSO, to make them look like they came out of the best bakery in the universe,  I gently position a couple of choclate chunks and Trader Joe's mini PB cups on top of the cookies before baking.  Makes them look gorgeous.  Have renamed them...\"Better Than Sex\"!",

If you take the requested amount of brown sugar and use half of both light and dark brown sugar they are even better! also if you freeze the penut butter cups before you cut them they stay whole rather then melting in the oven. A little harder to cut but worth every second!!!!!",

Do not cook them for longer than it says to because they will harden up later trust me!",
