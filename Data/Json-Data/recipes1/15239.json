I agree w/ the other reviewers by needing a bit more sugar, so I added 1 extra tablespoon white sugar and dusted it with powder sugar immediately out of the oven.  (No need for sugar on top b4 baking) I also added 1 tablespoon milk since it was a bit dry and made the dough nice n' moist.  I've also used almond extract instead of vanilla the second time  and it was VERY good. I cut mine into 1\" x 2\" inch mini bars and have it with a hot cup of English Breakfast tea in the morning or when I have company and it's HEAVENLY.  Keep it in an airtight container and it tastes just like the first day.",

Thanks Kay!\n\nHaving said that - I have made the following modifications with great results: \n\n4 tablespoons white sugar instead of 2 (not quite sweet enough for us the first time I made this recipe) Once pressed into baking dish/pan and before I put it in the oven, I sprinkle with about a tablespoon of white sugar so that it makes a wonderful sweet-crunchy top on the shortbread!\n\nWe have Myer Lemons growing in the yard here in Florida so I have also now come up with a lemon shortbread version of this recipe:\n\nAdd the juice of half a medium lemon and two teaspoons of grated lemon peel and toss in an extra tablespoon or so of flour to compensate for wetness of the lemon juice - we love this version, I have made this lemon version two times now!",
