I also used all the egg instead of just the egg white. Turned out well. I read the reviews that said the batter was too much for the pan so I made 18 cupcakes first and the rest went into the 9/13 pan. I used a small ice cream scoop for the cupcakes. I put 1 scoop of the batter and 1 scoop of the creamcheese mixture per cupcake. I then baked them both in a convection oven for about 20-25 min. I also substituted splenda for the sugar. I will definately use this recipe again!! Edited to add: I did not add the kirschwasser. Only used vanilla extract for flavoring.",

I followed the other suggestions and baked this in both a 9x13 pan and another smaller rectangular pan. I topped them with a ready made cherry pie filling instead to the raspberry(to make my life easier) and it was DELICIOUS! And the proof was in the pudding- people loved it and asked for the recipe. Will definitely make again!",

The topping needed more raspberries to thicken. I did change cream cheese to fat free and used Splenda instead of sugar and egg substitute instead of real eggs. When I made the cake I used egg substitute also. This lowered the overall calories to under 180 per slice and almost no fat. Lovely dessert. Time consuming but well worth it.",

The white cake and the cheesecake were the same color and the cake's taste didn't particularly stand out so that's why the 4 stars but it was my doing not the recipe. Will defintely make this again but change the cake to yellow or chocolate to bring a bit of adventure to the taste and look. Also just used rasberry topping from the can. Everyone enjoyed it!
