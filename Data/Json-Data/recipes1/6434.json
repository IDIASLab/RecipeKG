My dad, who'd never had this kind of salad before, asked if it was my own recipe, because, \"this is a real award winner, if you ask me!\"  Thanks for a great, simple recipe!",

I substituted Swiss cheese instead of Cheddar and added 3 chopped hard boiled eggs and 1 cup of chopped celery. I love recipes that can be made-up ahead of time!",

I made it last weekend to test and brought it to an Easter dinner this weekend. I did change a few things. Instead of just iceburg lettuce I mixed in a package of spring greens to make it more colorful. I also used half mayonnaise and half miracle whip and added two tbsp milk to thin the dressing. I made the salad the night before and tossed it to just prior to serving. It still looked pretty and everyone got a good mixture of the salad.",

OMG it was amazing.  I started making it this way & my inlaws & parents declared it their favorite salad & request at all get togethers.  Just throwing this out as an alternative to a great salad.
