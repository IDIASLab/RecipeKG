I'm not a vegetarian anymore, but I still make it often because it's so good! Serve in burgers, or by itself with a side of green salad, rice or potatoes. This also makes for a wonderful ravioli stuffing.",

We really enjoyed the flavor--particularly the sun-dried tomatoes--but there just wasn't enough texture to them to make them satisfying. It was a little too much like eating firm mashed potatoes. Next time I make these I'm going to try substituting brown rice or kasha for the breadcrumbs and using larger pieces of onion and sun-dried tomato. We also served these with garlic-marinara sauce on top which was a wonderful addition.",
