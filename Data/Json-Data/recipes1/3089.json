I have a recipe called \"Louisiana Crunch Cake\" that is also an orange cake. It has a topping made of 2 TB flour, 3 TB brown sugar, 3 TB confectioners sugar, 1/4 tsp orange extract and 1/4 tsp orange rind. You combine the topping ingredients combine with 3/4 cup of the cake batter and pour into bottom of the Bundt pan and then top with remaining cake batter. That addition might add the crunch to this cake that people are looking for.",

For those that might appeal to,  then this is definitely a five star cake.  Given the ratio of sugar, butter and flour, I doubled the number of eggs which resulted in an incredibly moist cake. Obviously the orange syrup, which soaked into the cake, played a big part in that as well! I thought dried cherries would be a nice complement so I used those instead of the raisins.  While the walnuts and raisins (or in my case cherries) are certainly a good fit for this cake,  this is one occasion, probably because this cake is SO full of flavor, that I'd prefer this cake without either. Were I to make this again I would also cut the amount of orange zest in half for a more subtle orange flavor.  I made this in mini Bundtlette cake pans for individual cakes.",

Added 1 Tb triple sec to the glaze and it was great (highly recommend this).  Used 3/4 c vanilla yogurt cuz I didn't have sour cream and added 1/4 cup fresh OJ to the cake.  Used dried cranberries and 1/2 c mini choc chips.  Poked with toothpick before spooning on glaze.  When I turned it out after completely cool, the other side looked rather plain so next time I will make more glaze for the top.  I plan on making this one for Christmas!\r\n",
