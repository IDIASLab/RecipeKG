I used a whole onion and an 8 oz. container of sliced mushrooms from the produce aisle...I also used cream of chicken and cream of celery....that's what I had on hand.  I also used fat free cheeses and 98% fat free soups and just added 1/2 cup skim milk.  I bought 2 Pillsbury pie crusts and used all but one half of one to make the crust in a 9x13 casserole dish....I used the extra pastry to make flower embellishments on the crust. Will definitely make this again!!! Make sure and brush your crust with an egg wash to get it nice and golden and crunchy!!\r\n",

The inside of the pie was too runny it did not thicken up at all. If i make it again i will definately use less soup or more chicken. The mushrooms also didnt help with the runny appearance as they cook they tend to make excess liquid. And i will be sure to use other suggestions and use fresh vegies. The frozen made the pie taste really bland. Just not tast enough for my family.",
