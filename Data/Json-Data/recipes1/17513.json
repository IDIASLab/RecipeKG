Hard to tell from the photo I submitted but the black salt is REALLY black - big flakes that almost look like charred bits of wood! It looked so cool! Mild tasting it complemented the asparagus brightening its flavor. But I didn't broil this - roasting the asparagus at 425 degrees for 12-15 minutes produced the guaranteed results I desired.",

I never use my broiler and didn't feel like turning on the oven so I sauteed my asparagus in some Kerrygold butter and a little water until tender/crisp. Sprinkled on the black sea salt just before serving and really enjoyed the unique flavor of the salt with the asparagus. One thing though once salted you should eat it right away. The salt starts to liquefy and turn into a very unattractive mess. I really think its best use would be on cold or room temp foods. Thanks for this one!:o)",

Black salt is also more of a finishing salt, so I'd recommend adding it right at the end before serving. When you use it during cooking, the color tends to leach out and leave unappetizing grey liquid on the veggies. The cook time was spot on though. I would make this again with the noted changes.",
