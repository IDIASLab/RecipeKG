Instead of the water I used canned coconut milk thinking there would be a stronger coconut flavor in the cake - but it didn't make a difference. Next time I'll just use water. I skipped the toasting the coconut part and only put 1 cup shredded coconut in cake batter. I also used one whole stick of butter in the frosting and upped the powdered sugar to at least 4 cups and the milk to 3 tsp. There would have been way too much a creamcheesy taste if I had only put 2 T butter in so I'm glad I added more. I frosted the cake and then added 3 cups shredded coconut all over.",
