I always prepare this a day ahead to let it refrigerate so I can remove the grease.  Another tip and this is for all crockpot recipes, unless you want thin gravy or sauce you need to allow additional time and cook for the last few hours on high without the lid.  I usually using the cooking time for low on all recipes with sauce.  I start out on high and as soon as the sauce is really hot I take the lid off the crock.  My family does not like a thin sauce.  This recipe freezes very well so I always triple the recipe.",

I shredded the meat and served it on toasted sesame seed buns with a dollop of coleslaw on top ~ YUMMY! The only thing I'd do different next time is cut the vinegar down to about 1/8 cup, as it had a stronger vinegar taste than I prefer, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing! My husband and I both loved this and I'll definitely be making it again real soon! Thanks for a truly delicious barbecue recipe, Corwynn! :)",

I serve on buns or over rice w/ a salad.  I usually reduce the vinegar just a bit for family preference.  Also, I trim the meat thorougly before cooking to eliminate fat in the BBQ sauce.  I tried the suggestion of making a second batch of BBQ sauce once, but found that I had trimmed the meat enough to eliminate most fat.  Plus, I liked the flavor of the BBQ sauce that had been cooking all day with the meat.  This dish is great for parties, family events, etc.  This recipe is a keeper!",
