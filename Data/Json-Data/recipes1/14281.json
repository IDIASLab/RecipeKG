Here are the changes I made:\n\nThe first time for just the family I cut the recipe in half, replaced all the meats with boneless, skinless chicken breasts, did not saute the onions or celery, used one can of Rotel and one smaller can of diced tomatoes and put it all in the crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hours.  About an hour before dinner I took out the chicken, shredded it, returned it to the pot and added 1 cup frozen corn, one can cream style corn and 1 cup each frozen okra slices and baby limas.  My 14 year old said, \"Mom, this is the best stew we've ever had!\"\n\nWhen I made it for a large group (60 people) I tripled the recipe and replaced the meats with a pre-cooked sliced brisket that I chopped up, again used a mixture of Rotel and canned diced tomatoes  and added more of the extra vegetables at the end as before.  It was an all-out hit.  Everyone loved the slight sweetness that the barbeque sauce gave it. (I used Kraft Hickory Smoked.)\n\nThanks for a great recipe!",

Add a pkg. of frozen lima beans.  Also switch to niblet corn (1 can) 2 cans cream corn.  A little old bay definitely helps as well.  This is a lot less expensive and much better tasting than the $10 pint we get from the Ruritan Clubs.  Freezes beautifully.",

This recipe turned out great, just like it should have tasted!  The only modification I made was to use only one can of the creamed corn (not being a huge fan of canned cream corn) and added additional frozen corn kernals.  Also, a couple notes-Hot Sauce (like Tobasco) is essential, not so much to make it spicy but to really give it the flavor that makes it brunswick stew.  Also, many southerners would never add vegetables (potatoes, green beans, oh the sacrilige!!).  So, if you want a true brunswick stew, stick to the basics (onion, etc.) in the recipe.  Also, instead of the ground pork it is also good with shredded pork roast.  This is especially great when eaten with BBQ on a fall Saturday afternoon watching a football game!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!!",
