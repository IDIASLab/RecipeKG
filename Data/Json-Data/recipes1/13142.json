I added a tiny bit of brown sugar (about 2-4 T) and some apple cider--then cooked it a little longer with the lid off to cook off the liquid. I also splashed in some vanilla at the end. Maybe I was spoiled by a recent batch of apple butter looking for a more intense flavor but it seemed like it needed a little punch--but I think even without the additions it makes a nice basic fruit sauce.",
