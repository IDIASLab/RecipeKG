After making these cookies for the first time I had 2 requests for the recipe.\r\n\r\n1/2 cup rolled oats\r\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\r\n1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda \r\n1 teaspoon salt\r\n1/4 teaspoon cinnamon \r\n1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened \r\n3/4 cup brown sugar, packed \r\n3/4 cup granulated sugar \r\n1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla\r\n1/2 teaspoon lemon juice \r\n2 eggs \r\n3 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips \r\n1 1/2 cups chopped walnuts \r\n\r\n1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.\r\n2. Grind oats in a food processor or blender until fine. Combine the ground oats with the flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a medium bowl.\r\n3. Cream together the butter, sugars, vanilla, and lemon juice in another medium bowl with an electric mixer. Add the eggs and mix until smooth.\r\n4. Stir the dry mixture into the wet mixture and blend well. Add the chocolate chips and nuts to the dough and mix by hand until ingredients are well-incorporated.\r\n5. Spoon rounded 1/4-cup portions onto an ungreased cookie sheet. Place the scoops about 2 inches apart. You don't need to press the dough flat. Bake for 16-18 minutes or until cookies are light brown and soft in the middle. Store in a sealed container when cool to keep soft. For the best results, chill the dough overnight in the refrigerator before baking the cookies. \r\nMakes 20 cookies.\r\n\r\n",

I just used an ice cream scoop, dropped the balls onto a jellyroll pan and stuck them in the freezer.  After they hardened I then placed them in a freezer bag and baked them as needed on parchment at 375 degrees for about 12-14 min.  I'm sure the Doubletree doesn't have someone mixing cookies all day long, and the freezing I believe helped them hold shape... they were perfect!  Plus having them in the freezer allows me to have some on hand for guests... just like the hotel! Thanks so much for this recipe!",

It's best to chop the nuts before measuring. The recipe was still good. I prefer to flatten the cookie dough into thick round disks so that they have a nice shape and size. When I gave out cookies from the first batch to some friends, I was asked for the recipe; however, this will stay in my secret recipe stash. In my opinion, these are extremely close to the original cookies but without the cute storage tin. As another baker suggested, I was thinking about reducing the eggs to 3 but decided not to. Why mess with something that my husband and I like? I do have one tip for the baker from Indiana with the lemon problem...when lemons are in season and cheap, buy a bunch, juice them, freeze the juice in ice cube trays, and store the juice cubes in the freezer. Whenever a recipe calls for lemon juice, take a cube out and thaw.  It's that simple. I also freeze lime juice to use in Mexican food.",
