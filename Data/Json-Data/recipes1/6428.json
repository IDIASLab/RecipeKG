As someone previously mentioned, some of the directions are needelessly complicated or leave out important steps.  First, this is the classic cream puff dough recipe with 1C water, 1 stick butter, 1C flour and 1C eggs (far easier to measure since each egg is slightly different).  Mix the butter and water together and heat to a boil (no need to heat separately and if you boil too long some of the water will boil off changing the ration of liquid to dry ingredientes with is very important in this type of recipe).  Remove from heat, dump in the flour/salt and stir until dough forms.  Let COOL for 10+ minutes.  Place dough in stand mixer with paddle attachment and add eggs one at a time until a smooth dough forms.  Use 2 soup spoons to place dough (will be very sticky) on parchment lined cookie sheet.  Bake at first at 400 for about 10 minutes (causes dough to puff up) then reduce heat to 350 and bake ~25 minutes.  Remove from oven, let cool.  If you bake them correctly then won't flop and there won't be a need to remove any raw dough from the center.  Most recipes show 2 different temps for baking, one to puff and the other to finish baking the dough. Fill with your desired filling.     ",

I didn't split the puffs on my second batch, I only made a hole in the side of each with the back end of a wooded spoon.  The whipped cream was great, but deflated overnight.  I found a recipe to keep your whipped cream stiff by adding 2 tablespoons of dry instant vanilla pudding to the mixture, and be sure to use powdered sugar which helps the whipped cream stay stiffer.  I will be making these again - they did taste great.",

I love sweetened whipped cream and found it to my liking when I made these.  I just made certain that the heavy cream was whipped to form stiff peaks and filled the cream puffs rather full, serving them immediately is the trick!  If you cannot serve them right away, I suggest freezing them. Take them out of the freezer about an hour before you do serve them.\r\n\r\nI used chocolate syrup instead of the melted chocolate chips.  Any flavored syrup, like strawberry, would also be good.",
