As I already use almond flour in baking and had it ready to go, I lightly toasted a cup of it first rather than toast and grind extra almonds. I reduced the almond extract to 1/4 teaspoon as I thought the full 1 teaspoon would be too strong for out tastes. It added just a subtle hint of flavor. I also opted to add 1/3 cup chopped dried cherries to the batter. If you make the six cookies as directed, they will be quite large. I measured out a tablespoon of batter per cookie and that yielded a dozen cookies of typical size. Anyway, this recipe will go on our regular cookie list.",
