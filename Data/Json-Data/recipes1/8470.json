Second tray...9 minutes...basically the same look. Tried the last tray @ 7 minutes & they were perfect...middles were a little un-done but the next day they were still soft & delicious.",

Sometimes I use nuts or crushed peppermints or M & M candies. The choices are endless with this recipe. But the Devil's Food Peanut Butter Chip cookie is one of the BEST!",

The only way to eat them now is to zap them in the microwave for 15 or 20 seconds. Definitely not going into my Christmas baskets.",
