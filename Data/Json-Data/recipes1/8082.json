My Austrian grandmother \"Oma\" made these for us every Christmas. I have continued with the tradition and can't imagine a Christmas without them. The only change I make is that once the cookies are out of the oven I dip them into granulated sugar as opposed to confectioners. Confectioners sugar tends to yellow and eventually disappears into the cookie. Try these they're wonderful. Thanks Deana!",

I came across this one and another on this site (Pecan Crescents). So many recipes come down to personal preference but I must say this Crescent Cookies recipes paled in comparison to the other. The most notable difference was 2.5 cups flour here vs 2 cups flour 1/2 cup powdered sugar blended in on the other recipe. Having the sugar IN the dough really makes a big difference in texture and sweetness and I much prefer the other version. This one had drier dough that was harder to keep together while rolling and nearly every cookie broke when I gently tossed in the powdered sugar. If you're a fan of these but this version also isn't quite right for your tastes try the \"Pecan Crescents.\"",
