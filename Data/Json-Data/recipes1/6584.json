Tastes like from a box.\" We weren't too impressed w/ this recipe and unfortunately it made so much (I even skipped the optional canned tomatoes and decreased the pasta) that I had to separate it into 2 baking dishes freezing one for a sigh 'nother night. (Although when I go to thaw and bake round 2 I'll have to add some seasonings to make it more palatable.) I used fresh mushrooms but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. (Except my cringing at the phrase \"processed cheese food\" so I topped w/ grated cheddar.) Did not like the onions being raw at all so I would suggest lightly sauteeing the onions and mushrooms ( minced garlic perhaps) in a little EVOO b4 mixing everything together. Upon serving the dish it seemed like it would be a pleasant homey casserole but the taste was yawn-inducing. I thought for sure that my 3-year old would eat it; I mean chicken carrots noodles - kid staples! - but it was a labored supper experience all of us trying to finish our plates.",
