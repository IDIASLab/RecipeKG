The only changes I make are to use 1/2 white wine and 1/2 chicken broth instead of all chicken broth, and to use cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, garlic and black pepper instead of the Cajun seasoning. I also use no-fat or low-fat sour cream and leave out the capers. Thanks Linda for submitting it!",
