To this day I fix most of the above because I like them except for brains. I tried this recipe last week. Cooked it exactly as shown and was rewarded with an outstanding meal one that I would served to friends providing they did not ask \"what is this? The texture of the baked brains was very light and worked well with a bed of mushroom rice. Will add this to my monthly menu. Would eat it more often but it is not very healthy.",
