I was looking for a simple recipe to use in teaching my kids how to cook and this fit the bill since there was no chopping of veggies and it was easy for them to mix. This is a recipe that we have used several times now. I do find it a little heavy on salt as written and I'm usually not one to say that. I have cut the salt back by a third; using 1 teaspoon as opposed to 1 1/2. I've improvised by using ground red pepper when I was out of pepper flakes and it was still great. I've also improvised with equal amounts of instant stuffing mix when out of bread crumbs with good results. I generally use ground turkey with this just because that's what we always have on hand. Make sure to look for the video that the author made which shows this recipe being made!",
