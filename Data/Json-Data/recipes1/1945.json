My boyfriend and I made 4 loaves in a month. :)  I like to add 2 tsps. of cinnamon and 1.5 tsps of nutmeg for a little extra spice.  I stir in 3/4 of the walnuts and leave the rest to sprinkle on top with sugar.  It makes for a nice crust.  And if you're short on bananas, add some apple sauce (but not too much as it can make the bread TOO moist).\r\n\r\nWe did notice that it took a little longer to cook than specified, about another 30 minutes.  It's best just to check the center of the bread after an hour in the oven.",

I read the reviews and lessened the amount of sugar, but did both of brown and white sugar.  To make things easier, I mixed all the wet ingredients in my electric mixer and all the dry ingredients in a large bowl, and then combined them slowly.  My bananas were not completely ready but I tossed them in my food processor and gave it a quick spin to make it easier.  Finally, I topped the mini loaves with walnuts which added a nice crunch!",

I opted for 2 cups of sugar instead of 2 1/2, I used 1/2 c. unsalted butter, \r\n1/2 c.shortening and because I didn't have any buttermilk handy, I used 1 1/4 cups of whole milk with one tsp of apple cider vinegar added.  Remember that if you are using dark coated pans to reduce your oven temp by 25 degrees.  I found that my bread was perfect right at the 55 minute mark. I made this bread for my 6 year old granddaughter who is a banana junkie...she now thinks I'm a godess!",
