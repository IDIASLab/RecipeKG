I followed the ingredients as written, (except for using olive oil, of course!!)\nI know the amount of oil and butter may scare some, but it does make the dish. There are other recipes using only clam juice and wine as the base, but I find them not as decadent with lack of substance (much lower in fat and calories though:). I did sautee the garlic first(tons of garlic!), added crushed red pepper, and thickened it with some fresh parmesan at the end. I know some reviewers used cornstarch and flour, and that may have been good, but I was scared to do it!\nAnyway, thanks for the recipe!",

But for quick and simple to the table in 15 minutes this is a WINNER of a basic and easy recipe. I only did things a little differently - used olive oil instead of veg. oil and used garlic puree instead of minced garlic - I was out of fresh. And last five minutes added 1/3 cup grated parma cheese to make sauce a little thicker along with a 1/4 pasta water (starchy water  helps thicken instead of corn starch). Then I only added the clams the last two minutes or so of cooking so they would not get too chewy. In the time it took to cook the pasta the sauce was ready!  Recipe ''adaptions'' aside, this is a great recipe and I already printed a copy to keep it handy for next time. Clams are already on my grocery list again for when I make this again! Thanks Miss Dorothy for helping me find a new twist on one of my old favorites.",
