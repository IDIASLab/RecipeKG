I used the spices but added some cajun spice as well and I only had dried parsley but it worked out fine. I made several meat balls and I used some of the meat mixture and formed into patties coated in the cracker meal and fried in a little oil in a skillet. Made excellent burgers with homemade hot mustard. mmmmm... will be making these again for sure. Thanks so much!",

And they thought the shape should have been like a crab cake and eaten with a fork - as I shaped the balls they were not firm like a meatball. Several fell apart as I tried to fry them. They also fell apart if you tried to spear it with a fork or toothpick. I did scale to use 1 pound of gator (found in the freezer section at Marsh grocery next to the frozen fish for 7.99) so I could have been off somthing... I just couldn't get past the smell - even the whole house stunk.",
