I tore up big marshmallows to mini-marshmallow size. The tast is decent so with the second batch I got a 9x9 pan put half of the dough in the bottom sprinkled marshmallows on top and then pressed the remaining dough on top and made marshmallow puff bars.:) It was MUCH easier and the results were just as good. I likely cooked it for 20-25 minutes? I do not advise the ball route. All in all probably won't make again but thanks for putting it up!",

I don't think I did anything wrong but the cookie dough was crumbly so it was hard to form around the marshmallows. And in the baking process the marshmallows melted and disolved into the cookie leaving a little hole in the center. That part was VERY diappointing. But overall the cookies were a huge hit. Everyone in the office loved them!",
