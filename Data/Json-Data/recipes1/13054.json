I added a couple of shakes of salt and pepper on top of the hash browns and I baked them in the oven for about 10 minutes before pouring the egg mixture over the top. I didn't put quite the amount of milk this recipe called for.  I only put 1 cup in, if that.  2 cups just sounded too much, and would be very runny. I also added a few shakes of salt and pepper to the egg mixture because of some comments that the dish was a little bland.  This was smelled great while cooking and tasted just as wonderful!  Delicious!!  Thank you Stephanie!  This is definatley a keeper!",

I combined cheeses, including reduced fat cheddar, for a more healthy, lower-fat meal. I followed another reviewer's advice and put the hash browns in first and I think that worked well. I made it up the night before and cooked it in the morning.  Word of advice -- allow a significantly longer cooking time when refrigerated.  I needed to increase oven temp. to 375 degrees and needed another full hour in the second part of the cycle, for a total of 1 hour 45 minutes. It was still hot when I arrived at work and was gone in minutes. Certainly the best breakfast casserole I've ever tasted and if the reviews from work were accurate, a sure crowd-pleaser.  I supplied the recipe to a number of co-workers as they loved it too!",

I baked the hashbrowns in the greased casserole for about 30 minutes at 425. Meanwhile, I cooked the bacon nice and crisp. Over the potatoes, I layered the crumbled bacon, green pepper, onion, and cheese and poured the egg mixture over all. Then I refrigerated it overnight and baked it as directed in the morning. Some folks may be missing that there are two separate cooking times--45 minutes covered and then 30 minutes uncovered. If you realize this ahead of time, it helps with planning.",

I also thought it would have been very bland if I had not added salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic salt and dry mustard. Also needed to be baked in a 11 x 13 pan.
