I used a vegetable broth instead of chicken for this recipe.  This recipe was OUTSTANDING for flavor. I also added some toasted pine nuts.  My one suggestion is to make sure that the rice is undercooked before stuffing. I cooked it to long, and the final cooking time of one hour was to long for the rice.  It was kind of mushy.  But the flavor and texture (before the last cooking) was delicious.",

Add the Mint.  The recipe calls for mint, but never says to add it.  I added it at the sam time as the dill.\r\n2.  Use at least 3 grape leaves and 2+ Tbsp of stuffing.  I like my Dolma a bit larger than my pinky (the size you get when you follow the directions).  I arranged three leaves in a triangle, with their stems overlapping at the center, tips pointing out, and added about 2 Tbsp of rice mix right to the center.\r\n3.  Roll them tight, and make sure you're not overstuffing for the amount of leaves you use to wrap.\r\n4.  When you arrange them in the pot, if they are not pressed really tight together, they will float when you pour the broth over them.  The ones on the bottom will open up and the rice will come out.\r\n5.  Try them cold.  Refrigerate them overnight before serving.\r\n\r\n- Rick\r\nSan Diego, CA",

They were tough and chewy no matter how long I simmered them. It was recommeded to me by a friend from Athens to pour boiling water over the leaves, let them sit for 5 minutes, drain and let them sit in a bowl of cold water before they are used. 10 seconds wasn't enough for mine. Maybe mine were fresh leaves. Also, my friend suggested to put a plate over the grape leaves as they simmer so that they don't fall apart. This was a lot of work and I ended up having to through it all away but I'm willing to try it again with these changes. I'll write a new review when I do this.",

If I serve it as a main course I add 1 lb of ground lamb a handful of pinenuts or pistachios a handful of dried cherries or cranberries and about 2 oz of crumbled feta cheese. The lamb has a considerable amount of fat in it so you can use half the amount of olive oil or eliminate it altogether. If you like Mediterranean and Middle Eastern Food you will love this recipe. Don't let the pot get too hot or your leaves will burst; I use flavorful basmati rice so I prefer the rice to be fully cooked before stuffing the leaves.",

I use jarred grape leaves from a speciality store so I don't have to cook them as long (but they aren't shiny green either).  I agree w/ Rick, for a main dish, I like my leaves bigger than the recipe directs.  To help keep them closed during the simmering, sqeeze the stuffed leaves w/ your hand before placing in the pot.  I crave these, they are so good!  Thanks Patti!",

Next time I may add more of the mint or dill, and perhaps some toasted pine nuts.  However, the method works perfectly if you follow directions exactly; (and yes, it DOES tell you when to add the mint; add it with the dill!) the rolled leaves stay intact if packed closely together in cooking pot. I actually crowded them a little. On the grape leaves; best bet is to buy Mazetta jar of grape leaves, they are quite large and work well.  You want the grape leaves pretty tender, so just cook them longer (we cooked ours about 2 hours on a very low simmer) if needed.",
