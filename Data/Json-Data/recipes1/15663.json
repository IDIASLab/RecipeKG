I added cumin, coriander, a dark beer (fat tire, my favorite), and a spoon full of peanut butter. Sounds strange, but you only want enough fot the nutty flavor, helps bring out the flavors of the beans. Added hot sauce too. Severed over lime flavor chips, toped with black sour cream, cheese and black olives. To me, it was almost a gormet natchos not a chili, but the word chili is different in every place. I think I would take the lid off for an hour, to much liquid or add a little less broth, or even less beer, can always drink what you don't use, right.",

I did double the meat in this recipe only because I had two 1 1/2 pound packages that I needed to use. I tossed the stew meat with a little flour and the spices, then quickly browned the meat in a little EVOO before adding it to the crockpot. The recipe didn't specify which kind of salsa to use so I used salsa verde. This is cooking away right now--smells amazing. I'll update my review once we've had a chance to eat it. EDITED: VERY good. I liked this quite a bit. Next time, I think I'll add more red pepper and add a little more spices, maybe some fresh garlic, too.",
