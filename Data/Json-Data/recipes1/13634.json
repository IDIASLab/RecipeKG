Instead of garlic powder I used a couple of cloves of fresh garlic. I omitted the onion powder and chili powder and used salt pepper paprika basil parsley and a little cayenne to taste. I also used 2 chopped fresh tomatoes for the canned. Instead of instant rice I used long grain white rice and simmered it covered for 25 minutes. The few extra minutes work and cooking time made a difference in the taste. This is a good recipe with a few alterations.",

Be sure you have a BIG skillet for this recipe it makes a ton(closer to 7 or 8 servings rather than 6). I think next time I may substitute a can of corn and black beans for some of the tomatoes peppers or onions. Not that there were too many of them just that I think corn and beans would be an excellent addition. Maybe I should just get a larger pan! One more thing this makes an excellent chip dip. My girlfriend mentioned that it would be good with corn tortillas and we only had plain corn chips so we scooped them and it was great. I went out after dinner and got the tortillas I'm sure it'll be good as well.",

I added celery with the onions and peppers... instead of 1 can of whole tomatoes I subbed diced tomatoes with green chiles (Rotel style) and instead of chili powder I subbed cajun seasoning. Also the instant rice just didn't do it for us and seemed to suck up all the juices leaving the jambalaya dry so the next time I made this I used regular long grain rice cooked separately and added it at the end.... after these changes it was much better",

I added the onion powder and garlic powder just because I love them both very much but also added quite a bit of creole seasoning a dash of hot sauce and cayenne and replaced the whole peeled tomatoes with diced. I didn't use instant rice either making a pot of long grain white rice on the side to go with it instead. I would have kicked it up a notch on the spicy factor but my kids would have kicked my butt;p. All in all pretty good eats.",
