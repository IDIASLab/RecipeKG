I do most of my shopping at Trader Joe's and this recipe chicken included cost me 15.00 to make (eight servings). I went with the original recipe and \"tweaked\" it to my families likings. I started by cooking the chicken in a dash of Trader Joe's Garlic Oil (if you haven't discovered Garlic Oil -garlic infused olive oil- you are missing out) and held the chicken for dicing until just before the meal (this way the chicken keeps its juices and does not dry out). Like others before me I added many more mushrooms (one box of pre-sliced) and a whole diced onion. I also added a diced yellow and orange bell pepper and some fresh cut basil. Lastly I added a ton of fresh garlic (almost a full head) and another can of diced tomatoes (Italian style). Not only did this meal taste great it presented fantastic as well. All of the colors (red orange yellow green) make a great presentation. I topped off each dish with a teaspoon of both fresh grated parmesan and romano cheese. If you enjoy eating healthy don't pass this one up. Next time I am going to make this with some italian style turkey sausage. I can't wait!",

This is a great base recipe that leaves room for you to add your own personal taste! I used basil oregano garlic seasoned diced tomatoes. I used tricolor rotinni. After cooking the tomatoes onion and mushrooms for a few minutes I added the cooked chicken (which I cooked in a little bit of butter and the italian seasoning)and allowed it to absorb the juices of the tomatoe. Garlic is KEY. I can't tell you exactly how much garlic powder I used because I was tasting and adding.. I did however use quite a bit. I really liked this recipe because it gave me the opportunity to make changes to suit our tastes. Since its just be and my husband we had leftovers for 2 days. When you heat the leftovers up it tends to be a little dry. Try adding a small amount of hot sauce OR Italian dressing it moistened it up and gave it a little kick!",

Wonderful taste even the kids gave it a 3 & 3 1/2. Next time I may add 1 teaspoon of italian seasoning and an extra clove or two of garlic to give it a little more taste.
