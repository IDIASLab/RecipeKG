I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup; used a 15 oz can of pumpkin and added 1/2 tsp. of Nutmeg. I baked mine in a bundt cake pan for approx 45 minutes. I then made a glaze using 1 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 stick butter, 2 cups powdered sugar and milk; spooned it over the top and let it slide down the sides. I made it for Boss's Day and everyone is going crazy over it and how moist it is. I will be making this again and again! Thanks!!",
