Made it for Thanksgiving this year (2005) and it was a huge hit! One relative ate five helpings! I first made it for Christmas in 2004 and made a mistake. The recipe calls for \"boiling\" onions. It should state pearl onions. I used small onions the first time I made it and soon realized it's going to take a lot longer than 25 minutes to cook. This resulted in a loss of too much wine and a considerable increase in cooking time. This year I used pearl onions and they cooked in 25 minutes. Both times making this recipe I had to add either flour or corn starch to thicken it. 1 cup of heavy cream added to 750ml of wine is just not enough. I suggest 1tsp corn starch added to about 2oz of water mixed well then add it to the onion mixture. This way you don't have to whisk the flour into the liquid which would require you remove the onions. I would never suspect wine would be a good base for creamed onions but it works fantastically! I used a complex and oaky Chardonnay: Toasted Head. Give it a try and keep the things I stated in this review in mind. It'll help produce a real nice dish everyone will enjoy.",

I actually overcooked the onions somewhat carmelizing them(awesome oops). I then transfered the onions to a baking dish covered them in cracker crumbs 1/3 cup of melted butter and evaporated milk as I didn't have any whpping cream. I topped it with shredded parmesan cheese and finished cooking them in the microwave as I was out of space in the oven. They turned out GREAT! People were asking for the recipe. Next time I will try it with some fresh garlic aswell. Thanks for sharing the recipe.",
