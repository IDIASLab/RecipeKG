In the morning, it took less than 10 minutes to throw it all together and go.  My husband had 3 bowls!  Thanks for the great recipe.",

If you omit the red pepper flakes and replace one can of the tomato soup with a can of tomatoes with green chilis, this recipe is VERY kid friendly. When I want a more spicy version (I love spicy food!), I only add between 1/4 and 1/2 teaspoons of the red pepper flakes. An entire teaspoon simmering all day in a slow cooker will blow out your sinuses! In addition to the black beans, I also used both dark and light red kidney beans to make it more festive. This recipe is a keeper in my recipe box. Thanks!",

I only used one can of kidney beans - 2 cans would have been overload also used the other suggestions and used one can tomato soup and one can diced tomatoes with green chiles...added 1/2 can of water so I had no complaints on it being too thick. Also added a few sprinkles of hot sauce - not sure if that is what made it extra spicy or just the fact I added a little more than the 2 Tbsp of Chili powder. Omitted allspice and you would never know. I would have to say this is a keeper but would definitely NOT give it to my 2 1/2 year old much to spicy! Perfect with bread a little cheese and sour cream!",
