Also, I disagree with those who say the vinegar was too strong.  It is not supposed to taste like traditional cream based potato salads, so don't expect it to.  The vinegar was just right for me, maybe even not enough.  Perhaps those people used white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar?  I chose white balsamic, and someday when I have more money, I will splurge and try it with a gourmet bottle of champagne vinegar.",
