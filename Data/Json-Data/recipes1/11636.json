It doesn't hurt that some of my favorite foods and flavors on the planet are all in this sandwich - Alaskan King crab meat black olives artichokes cheddar tomatoes. Seriously this one was a no brainer. I used fresh crusty sourdough rolls that I buttered before heaping on the crab mixture. Other than substituting a little friendlier Tabasco sauce for the cayenne and adding the green onion to taste I made these exactly as the recipe directs. And why wouldn't I? - to mess around with this recipe would be to mess around with perfection. All of the ingredients come together to create something uniquely flavorful uniquely delicious and well just plain unique period. Rich creamy \"crabby \" elegant colorful can't wait for the next bite delicious. So many colors flavors and textures going on this really made for one memorable sandwich. I served this with a copy cat version of Olive Garden's Chicken and Gnocchi Soup which made for a totally satisfying and delicious supper. Regrettably this recipe has not been reviewed in two years. Folks you've GOT to try this!",

I used marinated artichoke hearts and used a bit of the 'juice' from them to thin the mayo a bit because I like a thinner mayo in salads like this. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. We ate it as hot sandwiches as the recipe indicates. We also ate it cold on lettuce beds. I used a little one morning warmed up and served over eggs. For those of you worried about the calorie count - don't. This makes FAR more than 4 servings. Flavorful and versatile!",

I sauted the cleaned peeled and butterflied shrimp with cajun seasoning and then cut them half. I also used red onion instead of green and used just a bit less mayo. We also had ours on sourdough bread which was just delicious! This reminded me a lot of the artichoke bruschetta recipe on here.",
