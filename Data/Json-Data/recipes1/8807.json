When the plaintain sits in the kitchen it will turn brown after a while,so we put them in water salt, so it so it won't oxidize. It is not necessary if you are frying soon after you cut them up.  The recipe says cut in chunks, but you SLICE the plaintain in 1.5 inch slices aprox.  The oil should not be TOO high, just heat the oil a little above MED for 8 min before starting so it will be ready. Cook to soften them and then \"squash\" them flat and fry again. Oil and water don't mix, so dry them before frying, if you insist on water.  Cast iron will get nice and black if you make tostones regularly.  Sprinkle salt when done and serve with ketchup, garlic oil or top with garlic shrimp... there seems to be many other suggestions. I will try to post recipe for mofongo soon...yum!",

A nice twist (and probably my favorite) is to make them with a ripe plantain (in which case they're called \"amarillos\".  For making amarillos, the plantain must be at least yellow or almost throwing to \"too ripe\"--close to blackening skin).  Cut the ripe plantain into diagonal, long slices and fry them--keep an eye on them because they cook much, much faster--turn around and they'll be burnt!--and drain on paper towels.  You can serve these with anything and are great solo.  Because they're made with a ripe plantain, they're very sweet.  My fiance doesn't really care for amarillos, but I wouldn't have my plantains any other way.  I would give both of these a 3 kid rating because, depending on the kid, he or she will love the tostones/amarillos or just hate them.  I grew up with them, so I simply adore them!",

                "reviewBody": "Just a few observations:   1. If you want to have a toston that is made like those in Puerto Rico you have to have green plantains (oh, and a plantain is not a banana. They are related, but are not the same. A plantain is much larger and thicker than a banana, even the plants are different).  2. The slices should be cut diagonally so the initial frying can cover the most area. 3. If you don't have a tostonera, a can or a plate can be used to squash the slice, 4. Once it is squashed it is put in salted water for at least 30 minutes, not just to prevent it from going brown, but to give the toston a very good salty taste. 5. Last you fry it until golden brown. 6. Some people make mayoketchup mix (mayonnaise mixed with ketchup) or olive oil with salt, lemon, and garlic or just sprinkle with garlic salt.  Hope this has clarified some issues with the recipe.",

Ask for Plantains at the supermarket in my experience they are qualitatively different than bananas dont exactly taste great raw. they are longer firmer like a cousin of the banana cooked while green for a firm crunchy taste or when yellow with brown spots for a sweet taste. Make a tomato and garlic sauce for dipping sprinkle with salt.. delicious! In some hardware stores you can find a tostonera look in latino catalogs for it it saves lots of time. its two boards with a circular indentation in the middle made to squish the plantain in a perfect circle.",
