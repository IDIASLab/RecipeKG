I made 2 batches now and the second batch I let the syrup and sugar cook a little longer-let it come to a boil rather than taking off the heat as soon as it bubbles. They stayed crispy in a container for 2 days. Also just a tip - I save cereal insert wax bags to wrap desserts like this. The waxed paper is better quality and food does not stick to it.",

I think its large size (cutting a piece off the roll is a bit large) at a gathering with many desserts made this unpopular as people didn't want a huge portion but there's not really a way to cut a small piece. It tasted good though I'll stick to version of bars with the chocolate tops. I also agree that after a couple days the cereal here loses its freshness.",
