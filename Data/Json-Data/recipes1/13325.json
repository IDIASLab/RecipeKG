Also used 3 green peppers 1 red pepper and increased corn to make it more veggie-laden. Added an egg to bind it. And to make it healthier I crushed up Corn Thins instead of corn chips (if you've never had them search for them! they're popular here in New Zealand/Australia and are like rice cakes but thinner tastier more fiber baked and made from corn yum! you can find where they're sold in the USA/elsewhere http://www.cornthins.com/) served as a casserole w/ chopped tomatoes on side. will make this recipe again very tasty!",
