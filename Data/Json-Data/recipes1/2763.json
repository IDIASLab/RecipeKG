I modified it by adding 6 cups zucchini and doing a streusel topping instead of a second pie crust.  The streusel topping is 1/2 c. butter, 3/4 c. four, 3/4 c. rolled oats, 1/2 c. br. sugar and 1 tbls cinnamon.  Mix until crumbly.  Follow baking instruction.  Magnificent! I will make this again and again!  Thanks for yet another wonderful zucchini recipe!",

I also love \"forgiving\" recipes and this one is.... I started the zucchini before I went to get the recipe and never seeded them - just peeled and sliced! Ha! It still worked great. I would cook more zucchini than you think you will need - they surely do cook down! What I thought was enough for 2 pies only did one. I used the frozen pie crusts. The top crust looked a little ragged since I had trouble getting it off the tin! (But then most of my dishes look ugly & taste great & this pie was no exception! ha ha!) We never told my motherinlaw what it was. She gave it rave reviews and thought she was eating apple pie. It tastes wonderful is easy enough for even non-pie bakers to make and is another way to use zucchini. (Our family loves zucchini all ways so every recipe is welcome.) Definitely worth your time to try it if anyone in your family likes apple pie! 5 out of 5 liked it here with only one comment from my son who preferred less cinnamon (I think I mis-read it tho - the amount is fine in here.) Have fun!",
