                "reviewBody": "I would give this 5 stars except that Drommar are NOT traditionally made with cardamom so I always leave that out. Drommar are not easy to make so I thought I would leave a few tips: 1. Browning the butter properly is crucial to the flavor. Plus you absolutely MUST use butter no substitution! Use a pan with light colored bottom like stainless steel so that you will be able to see it change color. Start by melting the butter at the lowest temperature. Then raise the temperature to medium and don't take your eyes away after this point! The butter will start to bubble and then foam. You will see the foam start to change from white to having patches of orangy-brown. I like to tilt the pan so I can see the bottom where the milk solids are browning. You want to remove the pan from the heat when the butter is nicely browned but before it burns! 2. Let the butter cool til solid but not hard. If it hardens too much it is difficult to form the balls. 3. I use 6 oz. of sugar which is a little more than 3/4 cup. 4. Cream butter and sugar really well before adding the flour. 5. When you mix in the flour you will get a crumbly sort of dough that doesn't hold together well. This is less of a problem if you haven't let the butter get too firm. So when you form the balls you will need to use really firm pressure. Don't worry this will not make them tough. 6. Definitely bake at 300 degrees for 30 minutes. The cookies will be much less crumbly. 7. Enjoy! These are my favorites!!!",

There was a question about the cooking temp. and time for this cookie on the Recipe Buzz. I tried both both ways and found for me the cookies held their shape better when baked at 300\u00ba for 30 min. vs 350\u00ba for 12-15 min. Very nice butter cookie Gail thanks for sharing.",

I think my cardamom might have been a little old though because I had to nearly quadruple the amount to taste it in the dough. It still mellowed out a little after baking. Other changes I made were minor: I used brown sugar rather than white sugar and I used 1/2 c. vegan margarine plus 1/2 c. water rather than 1 c. butter. They still came out great and I will be making this again!",

I lost the magazine I used to make Drommar every year and when I googled Drommar I get a coconut cookie which is not what I'm looking for. I really hope this is it. Please don't make the changes other people have made; this should be a snow white melt in your mouth shortbread cookie and please note that it calls for blanched almonds which means that the skin is removed. If this recipe works I'll post a more accurate photo. Giving it five stars HOPING that this is the correct recipe. UPDATE: It is the correct recipe. To make this recipe a success DO NOT STIR the butter. It is browned properly when the edge around is brown and the butter solids are golden. Allow the butter to cool just til it's solid; don't allow it to get hard. Use fresh cardamom; the fragrance of these cookies is amazing.",
