Our son who does not like fish said that since we will eat fish again he would like it to be made like this recipe and that he prefers this recipe over fried fish. My husband loved the sauce and kept heaping it on. Our other son ate fish until the pan was empty. It was a huge hit at our house. I had some very spicy homemade BBQ sauce on hand that I used and I put a little extra BBQ in the sauce for extra flavor. I do not like my food to be mouth burning so I substituted smoked paprika for the cayenne. The fish turned out wonderfully moist and flavorful.",
