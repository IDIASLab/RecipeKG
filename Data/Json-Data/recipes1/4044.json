The good news is that I was able to rescue them with a PERFECT icing recipe: combine 5 C. confectionary sugar 6 Tbs water 1 1/2 Tbs fresh lemon juice and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Mix all ingredients in a saucepan over low heat. Dip cookie tops in icing and let the extra drip back into the pan. Also I noticed that you really must let these cookies bake all the way through. Otherwise they will be shrivelled on the top rather than full and round. They also get hard very fast so either store them or eat them asap!",
