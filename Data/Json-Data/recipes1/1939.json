Mom always says it is very important to have the cream cheese at room temp, and beat it first separate from the other ingredients so you have a homgeneous mixture:-)",

If you have the time to make your own crust, Do It! (1.5 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/2 cup sugar and 5 T. melted butter. Bake at 350 for 7 - 10 minutes) Also, If you have even more extra time and extra money, make your own whipped topping too! Directions: Place one cup heavy whipping cream and 3 T. confectioner's sugar in a chilled mixing bowl, beat until stiff peaks form. Spread on top of this delicious pie and enjoy!!",
