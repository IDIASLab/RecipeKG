I served them with marinara sauce, which my husband and I both thought was the perfect accompaniment.",

I did tweak the recipe a bit and followed the suggestions of others. The liquid from the zucchini absolutely needs to be squeezed out to make this work--otherwise it will be much too runny. Here is what I did: used 3 eggs instead of 2 (i had a bit more onion and zucchini than what was called for), added 3 cloves of pressed garlic, a 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes, 3/4 to a full cup of italian seasoned bread crumbs, and 1/2 c. of cheddar (on top of the other cheeses). Also, I lessened the amount of flour to maybe 1/4 c. Lastly, I sprinkled the patties with bread crumbs before frying. Will definitely make this again--can't wait in fact!",

Time depends on your oven, the size of the patties and thickness. I spray the bottom of the pan with PAM. I squeeze as much water out of the zucchini as possible and I don't use salt. The salt makes the zucchini more runny. There is enough salt in the cheeses and you can always salt them after they are baked. I also use 1/2 cup of pepper jack cheese and 1/2 cup of feta instead of the mozzarella cheese. These cheeses give the patties a better taste. I don't use any oil or flour in my patties. I use Italian bread crumbs I also double the recipe but don't double the eggs.",

I am so thrilled that it is so popular and that Allrecipes has put it in several of their cookbooks.  It is a versatile recipe and can be varied with any indgredients except of course the zucchini.  One of the best tips for making it is to drain the zucchini as it makes the batter runny if you dont and doing that in a couple of paper towels works wonderfully.  Just wring it out.  Thanks again, readers.  You are a great bunch!!!",
