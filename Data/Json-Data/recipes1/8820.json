Don't get me wrong the cookies were ok but definitely not chocolatey enough. Also as everyone else said 10-12 minutes was too long and the edges got hard. The filling was the bad part though. Due to all the butter that is into it that's all I taste when I ate one - butter. Also because of the butter I had to refrigerate them to keep the filling from separating. And I also had to almost double the filling recipe so I'd have enough to go into each \"pie\".",
