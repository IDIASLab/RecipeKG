First I added about 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the beaten cream cheese and sugar then I whipped up 2 cups (500 ml) of whipping cream (35%)- instead of the frozen whipped topping - until stiff peaks formed and folded this into the cream cheese mixture. Finally I wanted to take advantage of blueberry season and instead of pie filling I used fresh blueberries (about 1 1/2 pints should do). I arranged them in a circular pattern over the cream cheese mixture and then brushed a red currant jelly glaze over the blueberries. Voila! C'est magnifique!",

It was a hit with everyone too. I will make this again and will always consider it whenever I need to throw a dessert together quickly. Thanks! 2015 UPDATE: I continue to make this dessert as requested (especially during the summer) by my family still using two (9-inch) prepared graham cracker crusts (baked for 10 minutes at 350 F) without the pecans but otherwise leaving the recipe unchanged. It is 12 years later still a hit. I always say I'm going to reduce the amount of whipped topping in the cream cheese mixture but I never do. These freeze exceptionally well and I almost always freeze one for a later day. Thank you G.Roberts for a recipe that has such staying power!",

I layered the pie so that the cream was on top and not the blueberries then decorated the top of the pie with banana chips fresh bluberries and walnuts. Thank you! 5 stars!",
