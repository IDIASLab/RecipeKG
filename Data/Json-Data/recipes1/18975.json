I MADE IT FOR 10 SERVINGS AND THERE WAS PLENTY! I DIDN'T HAVE SEASONED CROUTONS SO I USED UNSEASONED AND ADDED SEASONING TO THE BUTTER WHEN I MELTED IT (GARLIC SALT, PEPER & PARSLEY).

I didn't change a thing with this recipe except next time I will cook it a little longer before I put the cornflake mixture on it. I know it seems crazy because the cooking times are so long as it is but I had some areas where the potatoes were not quite done. Maybe 55 minutes covered and then 25 minutes uncovered.",
