I made it for my son's first birthday recently and had the same problem another poster listed- it wasn't at all cooked in the center (think bowl full of jello) when I pulled out the pans at the end of the cooking time. So I just left it in there for another ten minutes. The edges were taller and darker than the rest of the cake but they weren't burnt- instead they tasted sweeter like the top of a good pound cake. I used two 8-inch round pans so the cake looked a little sunken in the middle but the taste more than made up for the appearance. I would suggest using a one-layer approach to have the best-looking best-tasting cake ever. p.s. I just used store-bought cream cheese frosting but not the nuts. Excellent cake mix!",
