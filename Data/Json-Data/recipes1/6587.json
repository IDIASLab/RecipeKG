I used Chambord (raspberry liqueur) instead of Amaretto substituted canned raspberries for apricots added some raspberry fruit spread to the filling to give it a thicker consistency and topped the icing with some fresh raspberries. It was so delicious. Only thing I will do differently next time is cut the icing measurements in half- it made way too much icing for one cake!",

I processed them with 3/4 c. of sugar and 2/3 c. of amaretto.  It was great and enough for 3 layers.  I also added 2 teas. of almond extract to the cake batter.  My icing was too thin even with adding lots more sugar.  Next time, I will use 12 oz. of cream cheese.  I covered the cake with toasted, sliced almonds.  I would make this again.",

The recipe states blending the amaretto and the apricots until smooth then spread filling on cake. Well my filling didn't spread.. it poured. It was like orange water. I wasn't sure about this but went ahead and finsihed recipe. The cake tasted good but for me and my guests...the filling had a little too much amaretto bite. I think next time I will use 2 cans of apricots and maybe 1/3 cup of amaretto in the filling. This isn't a cake that would appeal to little kids.",
