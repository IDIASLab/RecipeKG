Don't get me wrong you can taste the pineapple but once it baked it kind of lost the taste a bit. I also sprikled about two tablespoons of brown sugar on top once in baking dish for a sweet crumbly effect. I will deffinatly make this agian thanks.",

                "reviewBody": "I give this 4 stars, more for its potential....  although I think I figured out the problem!  Previous reviewers seemed to either rave about this bread, or say WOW! too much baking powder.  Baking powder reacts differently depending on the acidity of the fruit it is used with.  Pineapple is an acidic fruit; FRESH pineapple is much more acidic than CANNED pineapple.  I'm going to guess that those who thought the recipe is great as written used FRESH pineapple.  My experience is with CANNED pineapple, and I DEFINITELY had to use LESS baking powder!!  After 2 tries, I discovered that 1 tsp. baking powder was the perfect amount.  I also like more fruit & texture to my bread, so I used a 20oz. can of crushed pineapple with the juice (1 cup crushed pineapple + 1 cup pineapple juice did not add enough flavor), and 1 cup coconut.  Also followed another reviewer's suggestion to sprinkle 2-3 tbsp. brown sugar on top of bread before baking.  Delicious this way!",

Just that after taste. I will try this recipe again but only use 1tsp of baking powder and probably increase the baking soda to 1 tsp as well. shudder I had to throw the whole pan away.",
