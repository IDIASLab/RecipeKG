I made the soup according to the directions (adding a little more spices to my liking) and instead of adding the rice to the soup to cook I made the rice first (I used instant rice) and then the last 30 minutes or so just added the rice to the soup. Came out more like soup not mush. Hope this helps anyone else. Thanks for the recipe Corwyn. This one is a keeper.",

I like to spice up the soup a bit by adding some thyme garlic and basil. Find the right combination of these three to meet your taste buds. For the listed recipe that serves six I add one crushed clove of garlic about 1 tablespoon of dried basil and 1/2 tablespoon of dried thyme. You don't want to overpower the original recipe's taste just add some more subtleties. If you're having problems with mushy rice make sure to use parboiled rice. I've never had the problem with mushy rice when I've used parboiled.",

No frozen veggies so used 1 zucchini 2 carrots 2 celery 1/2 onion 1/2 lemon (squeezed juice) added 1/2T basil 1T thyme 1 clove garlic. The rice soaked up most of the broth so added 4 additional cups of water 2 cubes of MSG free chicken bouillon. Perfection! My new favorite. thanks",
