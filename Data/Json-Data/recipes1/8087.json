The initial bad rating this recipe got kindof threw me off at first (but I couldn't find another sugar free version) so I tried it. And I also tried a decaffeinated version that wasn't sugar free from another recipe I had where I used Tang and it paled in comparison. This recipe is the best! Now I'm off to try the caffeine sugar version. I think it will come out marvelously.",
