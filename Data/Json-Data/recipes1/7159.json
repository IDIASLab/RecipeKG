On a charcoal grill place the charcoal on the sides of the grill so none of the charcoal is directly under the meat.  Weber grills usually come with an accessory that will keep the charcoal in place or maybe a trip to the hardware store for an accessory.  This is also a good way to cook chicken.",

I really gave this a try and was so shocked at how nicely it worked, just like the recipe said.  I did put it on the direct heat at the very end to get a little darker color on the coating.  Texture was fabulous.  If you are leary of using indirect method, give this a shot! Served it with a made-up recipe for pineapple fried rice that was very very good.  At the end of the meal, I sliced up the leftover pork and mixed it into the rice for a nice lunch the next day.",

Just to add to the flavor I placed a foil packet of dry apple wood chips (not chunks) over the front burner and kept the grill temperature at 350 degrees. The tenderloin was at a perfect 160 degrees after the 45 minutes on the grill.  There was a small piece left that we sliced thinnly and used in a salad the next day.  So yummy - can't wait to try again.",
