A houseful of real Italians (bred, born and raised in Italy) ate this and loved it. I used taggiasca olives and suggest using olives in oil rather than brine for a rustic, authentic flavor. I cooked it the length of time required and was surprised that it cooked down so quickly, so that is a plus too. Lunch was ready in less than 20 minutes. Thanks Marbalet for your recipe.",
