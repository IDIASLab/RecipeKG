HOWEVER - I didn't have deli chicken SOOO I grilled some chicken breasts (first pounded flat) and then I carefully sliced the breast into 2 halves. Used a couple slices of ham and instead of the sour cream - I used Miracle Whip. Finally since I was making a batch for my family - I \"grilled\" the whole batch of sandwiches under the broiler on a cookie sheet - a minute per side (be careful b/c they will brown quickly). This allowed for 6 sandwiches to be done at one time AND my sandwiches were nice and thick - like a cordon bleu sandwich should be. The miracle whip gave it a nice zip. Thanks for the nice/quick lunch recipe Deirdee.",
