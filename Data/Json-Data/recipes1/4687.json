I made it awhile ago and forgot about it just came across the recipe again today while looking for something to do with boneless chicken breast (getting so bored with chicken). I remember having a little bit of a hard time getting the coating to stay on the chicken while cooking it kind of falls of when you turn it. I think I may make it as chicken strips tonight and put a little more oil in the pan so I dont have to turn it as much. Be careful with your heat! Needs to be hot enough to fry but low enough not to burn your pecans. Be sure to flatten the chicken or you'll need to cook too long and your pecans will burn. Will serve it tonight with a spinach salad and basmati rice.",

First I pounded out the chicken into thin 1/2 inch pieces. I used 'ground' not chopped pecans for a crust that stuck when coated. Just grind pecans in food processor. I added 1/4tsp ground ginger and eliminated the sugar. I also just brown the chickens on both sides in a med-high pan then finish chicken off in a 350 degrees F oven for about 15-20 min (depending on thickness of chicken). For a finish I made a Honey-Dijon glaze...yummy. 1/2 cup chicken broth 3 tbsp honey 2 tbsp Dijon mustard and 1 tsp fresh ground ginger. Combine in sauce pan and bring to boil continue on med-high heat until mixture has reduced by 1/2. Spoon lightly over chicken prior to serving...it will thicken as it cools so make ahead if you like a thicker sauce.",

The only tip I have is to defiantly head the suggestion of not letting your pecans burn and they will burn quick if you are not careful. I used chicken tenders rather than the full breast and turned them often to avoid burning. I ll make this dish again but for now I can t wait until lunch to eat the leftovers (only possible because I made a lot)!!",
