Makes about 32 smaller servings.  Great for giving a few small portions to the lovely elderly Italian couple next door!",

It was not sticky enough, so the presentation was a flop.... literally.  Very messy, too much work, not worth it.  For those who attempt this, here's the best tip:  When you roll the dough into \"ropes\", simply cut the ropes into the sizes you want them to be.  Once you fry them, they will plump up into ball shapes.  I wasted so much time shaping the dough into balls before frying them... a step that was completely unnecessary unless you have so much time on your hands that you don't know what else to do with your day.",

The only difference is that she added an extra egg, and 2 extra tsp. of baking powder.  They come out lighter and less dense.  You do not have to roll them into balls.  Just roll into a rope, cut into pieces and fry in hot oil.    To solve the problem with the honey being too thin to hold everything together, my grandmother always heated the honey with sugar.  If using a large bottle of honey, use 1 cup of sugar and heat on the stove till bubbly.  Then toss the strufoli into the hot honey, remove with slotted buttered spoon, and begin mounding onto a platter with the buttered spoon or, if you hands can take the heat, buttered hands. They will hold together nicely into a nice mound.",
