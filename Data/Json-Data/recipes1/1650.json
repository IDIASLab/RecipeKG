The second time I increased the honey to 1/2 cup, increased the yeast to 3 tsp, and added 1/2 cup oats, 1/4 cup wheat germ, 1/4 cup milled flax seed and 1/2 cup sunflower seeds.

I tried Kristin's honey wheat bread and was very, very impressed at the flavor and texture of the loaves her recipe produces. I love this recipe so much that I looked for more by her, and found the equally good Blue Ribbon White Bread recipe. Now, I use both Kristin's recipes for all my daily loaves. I do recommend using bread flour instead of all-purpose. It works much better for homemade loaves, and greatly improves the bread, especially in texture. Also, I now use melted butter instead of shortening after I fortuitously ran out of Crisco one day and had to substitute. Thanks for both recipes, Kristin!",

The recipes I have made in the past have all resulted in a dense, dry, tasteless loaf of bread...until now!  This is by far the BEST bread I have ever made.  I comes out soft and moist and full of flavor.  I now make this bread about every other day.  And, the best part is that it can be made in the bread machine!!!!!  All I had to do was to add all the ingredients according to manufacturer's directions and set it on the dough cycle.  When cycle is complete, remove dough and place in a buttered loaf pan.  Cover with a damp dishtowel and let rise for 1 hour.  Then bake according to the directions.  Comes out PERFECT every time!!  This one is hands down a keeper!!",

                "reviewBody": "For those who have said the loaf is too dense or didn't rise well please make sure you are using fresh bread flour and active yeast (quick rise is preferred for this recipe) in warm not hot water. Also knead the bread until elastic (about 8 minutes in a Kitchenaid or 10 by hand). When elastic it will be glossy and the bubbles on the surface will stretch and break. Roll and shape the loaf tightly to eliminate a center air pocket. Let rise in a warm and moist not hot area before baking. When done cool on a rack. Finally do not cut the loaf until cooled. This should give you a less dense texture. Continue experimenting - bread making is an art that changes daily due to moisture content in the air and flour. You learn it through trial and error.
