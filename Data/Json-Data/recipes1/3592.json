Although we love ranch beans there was none available so I used a can of northern beans instead. Also it was a little too thick so I added a SMALL can of V8 \"spicy& hot\" juice to the stew. Turned out great. Mild kick but great taste. I sprinkled a little cheddar cheese over my bowl to melt but the stew was great as is!! Would make again! Thanks for the EASY recipe Sam!!",

I also subbed Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes and some chopped up Roasted Hatch green chilies (that I had in the freezer) for the Rotel. Added in about 3 heaping T of my homemade habanero salsa (we like things spicy). This recipe is very easy to make with things in the pantry. I just had to pick up the soup. I did drain the corn (to rid some of the sodium).",
