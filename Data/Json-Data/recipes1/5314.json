I had to cook an additional 10 minutes for it to even fully set beneath the crispy top. It has a slightly rubbery texture. The flavor isn't bad it's just the combination of the consistency and texture that's not appealing. When making the filling it is imperative to stir the mixture constantly or else it will burn very quickly. When it is returned to the stove top for the second time make sure to cook over low heat instead of heating to boiling then reducing to medium. You will end up with a burnt curdled mess! I've never had an authentic Basque cake so it's difficult to rate for comparative purposes.",

When pouring the batter into the pan it seems like there is barely enough to encase the pastry filling but there is--just make sure to completely seal in the filling. The only change I made was to add about half a cup of butter to the batter because in all other recipes I found they usually have some. I don't know how much difference it made but a perfect cake came out with a beautiful layer of pastry in between. Very unusual texture and flavor--people who like it love it but some don't.
