Once the yeast was bubbly I then mixed the dough ingredients in my Kitchenaid with the dough hook since I'd rather wash that than the food processor. I followed the rest of the directions as written though I used garlic powder instead of fresh minced. I also put a little garlic powder in the melted butter brushed over the sticks. THe breadstickes turned out very nice.",

I did add some onion/garlic powder to the dough due to the bland complaints. Finally when it came time to bake I did without the butter/parm topping until after they had been baking for 12min. Pulled them out added the butter and parm and baked again for a few more min until they were lightly brown. These looked GREAT the texture was WONDERFUL (nice and fluffy) but the taste? Well there really was no taste. So they didn't taste bad but I couldn't taste them being good either. Plain white bread has more taste. If I could figure out a way to add some more taste I would make these again because they looked wonderful. I'll put these in my \"make again on a day I'm feeling creative\" pile...try to figure out how to help these otherwise wonderful breadsticks.",

I followed the recipe as stated except I didn't have any Italian seasoning so like another user I added a few shakes of garlic powder oregano and basil. I mixed the dough in my breadmaker then got sidetracked and ended up letting the dough rise for about 1.5 hours. Instead of shaping like a rectangle I rolled into thick ropes and let rise again. They really do expand a lot and I think allowing time to rise is critical to getting the right texture in this recipe. I didn't measure the parmesan topping but instead just sprinkled it from the can until they looked to my taste. I baked for 20 minutes (didn't broil as they didn't appear to need it) and they came out perfectly -- soft flavorful yummy way better than I ever expected. Thanks so much for the recipe!",
