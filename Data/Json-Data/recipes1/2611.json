Although we only had one apple in the house (we added 2 tablespoons oil so it didn't turn out dry), it was awesome!!!  I can't wait to try it with 2 apples.  I had my hubby take some to my picky next-door neighbor (okay, she's my mother), and she called requesting this as her standing birthday cake from this day forward.  My kids didn't like it, but they don't like anything without chocolate or vanilla, so their opinions don't count.  The only thing I might change is adding raisins....I think that would make this the best cake ever.  Thanks for an outstanding recipe.",
