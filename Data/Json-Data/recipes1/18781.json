I made these with \"Lorna Doone\" cookies as I had no graham crackers and the only other change I made was to put the lemon zest inside the batter.I had them cooling on a platter in my fridge when I ran to the market. Upon my return no more than 15 minutes later my home had been \"invaded\" by my youngest: 17 y/o daughter and about 1/2 dz of her friends. I had actually made \"40 something\" mini mini cheesecakes as I had no regular size cupcake cups. When I looked down I could have cried, there were 4 left on the platter UGHHH!!! The only consolation I had was that all I kept hearing was \"Mama, these are the bomb\". I couldn't possibly be mad? Anyway, I was thinking of adding pumpkin pie spice for Thanksgiving, then my mind started wandering... oreos, nilla wafers, pecan sandies (with a glazed pecan garnish YUM!), the possibilities are endless. I HIGHLY HIGHLY Recommend these they're so easy and so delicious, they will be my new \"go to\" when I need to bring something to a party. Oh well I guess I'm going back the the market again I need to make more \"mini mini\" cheesecakes, this time I'm hiding them!.... lol :-)",

                "reviewBody": "This recipe is SO easy to make. I have made it both as written and with 'healthy' modifications and it came out perfect both times! The changes I made cut the calories in half reduced the fat by 14g PER SERVING and increased the protein by 1g of fat. I had a few friends taste test the mods and they agreed it was out of this world! My husband didn't even realize that they weren't 'real' cheesecake until I told him:-) The modifications as written are for the recipe cut in HALF (we didn't need 18 for the two of us) Make the crust as written for 1/2 recipe. Replace the 1.5 blocks of cream cheese with 1 8oz block of GREEK cream cheese (lower in fat and cal and higher in protein) and 1 5.3oz container of your favorite flavored Greek yogurt (I used Yoplait cinnamon roll but vanilla would work too). Because of the sweetness of the yogurt and the slight sweetness of the cream cheese I cut the sugar to 1/4c. I also decreased the egg to 1 egg since the yogurt adds liquid to the mixture. I mixed all ingredients per the recipe and divided into 10 servings instead of 9 and worked the 'crust' up the sides of the cups a bit. Cooked for 25 min and while they were cracked when they came out of the oven they dropped and filled in the cracks as they cooled. Skipped the frou-frou toppings you don't need them and they just add fat and calories. If you use silicone muffin cups you can pop them right out and put them on a serving tray perfect finger food!:-)",
