I did use melted butter instead of shortening only because I am out of Crisco right now AND I added a teaspoon of salt. I added the flour a half cup at a time up to four cups then a quarter cup at a time until it was where it formed a solid ball without sticking to the bowl. I then kneaded it with the dough hook for five minutes. After the first rise I rolled the dough into heaping 1/3 cup balls and plopped them into the greased cast iron skillet then covered the with a dishtowel and let them rise until the doubled. I baked them at 400 for just about 17 minutes. These turned out absolutely wonderful. I was telling my husband these rolls reminded me of the \"church lady rolls\" I used to get at church dinner nights. They were light and fluffy and just wonderful. This absolutely was a success. Great dinner roll. MAKE SURE YOU ADD SALT.",

I saw some of the reviews said their rolls came out heavy mine were light as thistle. I used my mixer to beat in the flour and I let it set overnight in the frig. (a full 9 hours)maybe that was the difference. I used butter instead of shortening and I made my own self-rising flour by adding 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt per cup of flour. I tripled the recipe and they were all gone! I thought the idea of melting the butter into the milk and warm water was a grand time saving idea.

It came out more cake like and yellow (perhaps coz of the margarine) and I am unsure what when wrong. I kept it over night (almost 12 hours) covered and the top of the dough had a crust (due to the chill in the fridge). It had a soggy rather uncooked center and a dark browned crust on top. Would be great if someone told me how to do it right. Also i sprinkled yeast on hot (slightly cooled) water and it didn't bloom /bubble so I stirred it into the water and it got all cloudy. And my milk- margarine mixture was hot though i let it to cool a bit before adding to the flour and yeast-water. Of course I am no expert in bread making so my rating doesn't really count.",
