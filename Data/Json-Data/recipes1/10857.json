Although purists out here insist on just the red chilis and water to make \"red sauce\" I usually add onion garlic cumin and a dash of salt and use chicken bouillion cubes to flavor the water. Some people add tomato sauce - I recommend against it. Use a fatty roast if you are going to slow cook it like a picnic so that it stays juicy. This is definitely not a good recipe for a pork loin. Adovada is good on sandwiches tacos burritos for making tamales and by itself. You don't really need to dress it with lettuce tomato cheese etc.",
