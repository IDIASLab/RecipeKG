One 6 oz. jar Kraft olde english cheese in jar 1 1/2 tsp. mayo 1/2 tsp garlic salt and 1/2 cup butter melted.(must be butter). Blend all and stir in shrimp at end so they don't mushed. Top split english muffins and broil until golden then slice in quarters. Some times I use 1 less muffin to get a thicker topping. These are such a big hit I always end up with an empty platter! Fabulous!! Thanks Ellen for sharing!",
