Why you called Solianka \"Beef Soup\"?=) It's not! I would call it \"Smoked Meat Sour Soup\"! That would be the rightest name!=)) Anyway, sounds good! This is one of my favorite soups in my country (Russia). The original way is: stock based on a pickles brine, there are ham, sausages, bacon, kelbasa, some beef, lemons, olives (black and green), tomato pure, onions, celery.....what else?.........parsley, cilantro......oooohhh!!!!!!!!!!!!! pickles, diced..capers??? you can add but the original recipe comes with pickles, so...thanks! I rated this recipe with \"five stars\"!!!!",

I did have to substitute alternate items for the veal (thin sliced beef) and marinated mushrooms (regular raw mushrooms) and used dried dill weed instead of fresh because I couldn't find it. This was for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I got multiple comments on how tasty it was. I served it with Russian black bread and a basic side salad and it was perfect. Everyone should try this. It does indicate that it feeds 6 but I could easily have fed 12 people with the soup salad and bread. Everyone should try this because the flavor is not what you would expect given the ingredients.",
