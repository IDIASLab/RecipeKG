I used 2 leftover roasted breasts, 1 1/2 cups salsa, less cinnamon,\r\nand I did not use the blender to pulverize the salsa. I merely added all the ingredients to the pan after onion and garlic were tender and heated.  I used 10 10inch flour tortillas and filled them each with 1/3 cup filling.  Now get this!  I baked 5 of them and deep fried the other 5.  The fried ones were more authentic and did not absorb as much oil as I thought they would.( oil must be very hot) The baked ones were just as delicious but with a slightly different texture to the tortillas.  Be sure to paint the tortillas with oil all over before baking.  Excellent recipe, Jeri. Kudos to you   Francy",

I've eliminated the beans (makes the chimis too mushy) and the garlic (makes the leftovers too stinky). I make extras and freeze them to reheat for lunches -- obviously they're not crispy when reheated but they're still delicious and the aroma will drive your co-workers crazy with envy! I don't even have to measure any of the ingredients it's become so familiar and automatic. Thank you Jeri!",

The chili powder makes a very strong statement so cut back on that a bit if you prefer a little less heat and intensity of chili flavor. Don't bother with adding the water and the extra step of pureeing the sauce as it's not necessary and will just create more clean up. There is also no need to secure the rolls with toothpicks nor turn them while baking. Just roll and bake - they turn out crispy all over and won't fall apart.",

I think I will make again...much healthier than deep frying but will tinker with spices (like the others) and add our other favorite ingredients like shredded cheese. Thanks for the post.",

Everyone in the family raved about this recipe and I will be making it again. If you need to get shredded chicken put bone-in chicken in a crockpot on high for 4 hours with a can of chicken broth and enough water to cover the chicken. After 4 hours the chicken will fall off the bone and you can easily shred it!",

I bought a rotisserie chicken from Publix and shredded it which worked really well and I only used a half of the recommended cinnamon because I was nervous about it. It gave a slightly different flavor which was great. I also topped with store bought queso on each serving. I wouldn't recommend adding to the whole dish because it would make the leftovers mushy just heat up the queso and add when serving. Leftovers were great too. Thanks for a great recipe.",
