The texture was not heavy (or \"rich\") like I thought it would be, and actually turned out lighter than other recipes I made (from this site) the same day.  I was also not fond of the prominent egg flavor, and the bread was not as sweet as other banana bread recipes I've tried.  If you do opt to try this recipe, watch the baking time closely--  mine took no where near 90 minutes to bake.  The ingredient list made me think this would be a great bread, but it is not a recipe I will make again.",

The texture is more fine than most quick breads. In fact this has more of a light muffin quality about it. It also reminds me of pound cake. Light and refreshing. It makes this more of a spring bread than heavy fall or winter quick bread. Very pleasant indeed! I did do a couple things different. I used 5 eggs and 4 bananas. I'm trying to get rid of 2 bunches. I used cinnamon in place of nutmeg too. And I threw in a handful of raisins. I would also recommend you watch the baking time. Check yours at 70 minutes to be sure. Mine was a little over baked at 80. Thank you for sharing this recipe!",
