Try using Synder's of Hanover \"Hot Buffalo Wing\" pretzel pieces for some extra kick.\nI cut the hot sauce down to just a tablespoon, still hot but not so overwhelming. I use Hidden Valley dry ranch mix and definitely DO NOT leave out the celery seed, it makes this great.\nFor perfect texture the trick is to bake the mix. So preheat oven to 350. Mix together cereal, pretzels, goldfish. Melt butter in microwave then stir into it the last three ingredients (1 tbs. hot sauce though). Pour over cereal mixture, stir. Bake in a deap BIG pan for 15 min, take out stir throughly, then bake for 15 more. Take out stir and allow to cool completely.\nThis stuff rocks!",

Instead of packaged ranch dressing mix, I make my own from scratch, I suggest using Scotdog's dry ranch dressing mix which is also on this site. Hers has no salt which is good in this recipe because you get enough salt with the Goldfish and pretzels. I always use Frank's hot sauce and some times, I'll cut back on the goldfish by a cup and add in some dry roasted peanuts or almonds. NOTE: I do not use celery seed. We don't care for it.",
