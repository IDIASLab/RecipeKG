While very tasty I think I still like the 3 bean look of the salad being more complex and fancy. Anyway, instead of using Italian dressing, which is fine in a pinch I'm sure,it's a little too tangy and I like it a little sweeter. I used a 3 bean dressing,\n3/4 cup white sugar \n2/3 cup distilled white vinegar \n1/3 cup vegetable oil \n1/2 teaspoon salt \n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper \n1/2 teaspoon celery seed \nStill very easy and fast. Of course, better affter a long marinate.",
