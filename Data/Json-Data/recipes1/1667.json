(The batter does taste and look like chocolate mousse!) The frosting was a wonderful match to this glorious cake. But the best part? Both 4 yr olds got in the action. (He made the cake / She did the frosting) And were pumped that \"This is yummier than Mom's cake!\" (Yeah my last one was a doozy). Oh yeah: I didn't have three round pans so I whipped up an additional 11 cupcakes... Why 11? We couldn't stop \"Taste testing\" the batter",

When I make it I make 2/3 of the recipe (8 servings) and make it in a 9x13 rectangular pan or a molded pan that I have that looks like a flower. I use light buttermilk and I frost it with canned chocolate frosting because canned frosting has less fat and calories than the homemade kind. It always turns out great and tastes awesome!",

The frosting is similar to chocolate mousse and the cake is soft and spongy (almost too soft and spongy--the cake cracked in a couple places--but it was still delicious). One thing I would caution people about is the amount of sweetness. Next time I will make it I would reduce the amount of sugar by 1/4 maybe 1/2 cup. It's just way too sweet otherwise especially with the use of semi-sweet chocolate. Other than that this is a delicious cake.",
