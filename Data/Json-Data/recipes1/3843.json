Also deglazed the pan with a little merlot. My husband and I really enjoyed it the tomatoes made a great light tasting sauce. Used fresh grated parmesan. Blended well. We're having it again tonite.

I always steam the broccoli and toss it with the pasta and sausage at the end. If the mixture isn't moist enough I toss in additional broccoli steaming water to our level of moistness. I only use hot turkey italian sausage (for fat/calorie purposes) but real hot italian sausage is the most flavorful. I normally remove casings and cook the sausage until it's well cooked and crumbly. I'm not a huge salt fan but I do add salt to this dish to compliment the dish well. It was out of this world! Thank you Susan!",

Only used 3/4 lb. of Barilla Plus Penne and added the al dente pasta and thawed broccoli into skillet.

I prepared exactly as per recipe except I boiled the broccoli 6 minutes instea of 3; and I sauteed the asparagus chopped at the same time as the garlic in order to soften it. The flavours were a very good mix & I would definitely to it again. I recommend chopping the sausage BEFORE frying assuming you want it chopped; it will cook much faster that way. If you like this try Asparagus Chicken and Penne Pasta from this website it is really very similar.",

I just wanted to make a very minor comment.  The dish that is pictured for this recipe is made with rotini, not cavatelli.  The difference is not just the shape of the pasta, but that cavatelli is made with ricotta cheese.  This makes the taste and texture quite different.  You can usually find it in the frozen section of your grocery store, or refrigerated at most Italian stores.  Better yet, (if you have a little extra time, make it yourself...it will add a whole new dimension to this recipe.",
