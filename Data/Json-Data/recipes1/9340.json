Instead of the processed American cheese I used a two cup bag of shredded sharp ceddar cheese; shallots instead of onion; 1/2c mayo & 1/2c sour cream; 2 cloves garlic. I threw the shallot & garlic in with the bacon during the last stages of cooking and then topped the potatoes. I left the olives out but that my personal taste. This really turned out to be a great recipe! Thanks!",

I used 1/3 mayonnaise with 2/3 sour cream bacon cut into one inch pieces and crisped diced red onion green onion salt and grated marble cheese to make a cold potato salad. Tasted just like a loaded baked potato. What a hit it was at my BBQ - especially with the boys! I am sure to make this again and again!!!",

Every time I make it people talk about it. Very important tho. It deff needs to sit all night it taste so much better the next day. It is so easy and so good. every one loved it. Added more sour cream and part of the mayo.The first time we ate it we ate it hot out of the oven. Now I bake it and then refrigerate all day until evening.Or until it is very cold . I take it out and break it all up in a bowl and add more sour cream. Top with extra shedded chedder and mexican mix cheese and some more bacon. serve it cold. Every one loved it and wanted more when it was gone. Makes a really great cold salad. Also Im not sure how it said to do the onions but I chopped them up. quite a few and then carmelize them. The flavor goes thru the salad but no sharp onion pieces in the salad. Kids here that dont like onions love the carmalized flavor of them in the salad tho. Best salad going. Like I said Better the next day. Thank you for this recipe.",

Not being a fan of warm mayo I added some sour cream that didn't help and I ended up throwing most of this away. I wish I had read other reviewers suggestions of just adding sour cream and not mayo before I started. Also make sure you leave your potatoes in large slices most of mine fell apart and I boiled them less than the suggested 10 minutes.",

I did not put the american cheese in with the potatoes and mayo, instead I put in about a cup of cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon , I baked it for about 35 minutes and then put a layer of american cheese on top.  I put that in the oven until the cheese melted and then I put on a layer of sour cream, topped with crumbled bacon and sliced green onion tops. I omitted the black olives for my family.
