I also threw some mesquite chips on top of the briquets for a little smoke. Make sure you use indirect heat otherwise you risk burning it.",

I had to put 2 pieces aside for my 1 son to have for when he got home from work for fear there would be none!:) Thank you for sharing this great recipe- I shall use it often!

I used oyster sauce instead of fish sauce and red curry paste instead of hot chile paste. Marinated 6 hours then grilled. So tender and juicy with a indian like flavor. Served this with jasmine rice and steamed spinach seasoned with vinegar. I didn't make the basting sauce or add the ginger that was not listed in the ingredients but used in the video. Next time I will try using the ginger but keeping the other ingredients the same. It's a keeper.",
