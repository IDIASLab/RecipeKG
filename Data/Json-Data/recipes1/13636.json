                "reviewBody": "After reading other reviews that stated this soup seemed bland I made a few changes.  First, I didn't saute the onions and I don't think it really made any difference. I used a meaty ham bone instead of smoked ham hocks because I had one left over from a Christmas party.  I cooked it in 4 cups water and 2 cups vegetable broth for a little extra flavor.  Also, I drained the sauerkraut but did NOT rinse it.  Rinsing sauerkraut washes most of the flavor away, which is probably the main reason most people thought this soup bland.  I never rinse it (but that might be because I'm Polish, and we like our kraut more sour I guess).  I also added 5 or 6 sliced mushrooms and 1/3c quick-cooking pearl barley when I added the sauerkraut to make it more hearty. I did not use any bacon because the soup is already a little greasy from the ham.  Instead I thickened it with about 2-3 T cornstarch.  I didn't want it too thick.  Finally, I made sure to temper the sourcream before adding.  It sounds like a lot of changes, but they were all more like little tweaks, and made for a wonderfully delicious and flavorful soup.  I highly recommend it.",

The only difference was the addition of sour cream.  For the rater who had her sour cream curdle... you did not temper it.  Always add a small amount of the hot liquid to the sour cream, mix well, add a little more of the hot liquid, mix well, THEN add it to the rest of the hot liquid.  This stuff is even better the second day!",
