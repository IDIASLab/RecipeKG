I thought people might be wondering why this is called \"brown bread ice cream\" when there is no brown bread in it.  Well, brown bread ice cream is an old British treat and certainly did not contain Grape Nuts!  You literally made your own toffee-flavored chunks by combining brown bread crumbs with sugar and caramelizing them in the oven.  Then blend with traditional vanilla base ice cream ingredients for a unique frozen dessert.",

Condense milk when it freezes becomes more like a hard caramel. Interesting but maybe next time I will use less to see what happens. It's very good but just melts too fast becoming a kind of sweet soup with bits of cereal mixed it. I have a terrible sweet tooth so I will eat anything with enough sugar in it but my party guests were wincing at the sweetness.",

Softening the grapenuts in the milk gave them the perfect texture! I was afraid of the raw eggs so I cooked the brown sugar sugar eggs milk & half and half until it reached 160 degrees and then chilled in the refrigerator. After it was chilled I added the sweetened condensed milk and extracts before putting in the ice cream maker. My husband thought the ice cream was sweet but loved the flavors. I thought it was unbelievably sweet. I would make it again but leave out the sweetened condensed milk next time. I think it was perfectly sweet using just the brown and white sugars.",
