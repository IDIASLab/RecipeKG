I recommend taking other bakers' advice on reducing the fat in this recipe. I used 2 C unsalted butter and altered nothing else. They came out a little flat but nice and chewy with a pleasant light mint flavor. Using butter that is barely softened just enough to cream the sugar would probably fix the flatness. If you have convection bake them at 330 degrees for about 7-8 minutes. Take them out when they look set and puffed. I really like these with crushed candy canes on top - the candy does melt a bit but they look and taste festive. Eat these within 2-3 days: brownie-type cookies get hard fairly quickly.",
