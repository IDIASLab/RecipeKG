I prefer to make recipes with brown sugar rather than white, I like the flavor better.  I also preferred this recipe over zucchini bread recipes that call for molasses, which isn't an ingredient I normally keep in my house.  Many family members and also friends commented that they didn't care for zucchini, and were most certain they wouldn't like the bread, but once they tried it, they all wanted a loaf of their own, that's why I've ended up making so many (lots of zucchini from the garden is another reason why!).  This recipe makes 2 loaves.  I tried tweeking the recipe a bit by adding more raisins/walnuts/cooking it for a longer period, but my final opinion is that the recipe tastes great just as it is.  I also learned from a friend that I can shred the zucchini and freeze it in freezer bags, and make the bread fresh when I want, rather than freeze the bread itself, so I'll be making this bread fresh at Thanksgiving.  One more note, I do peel the zucchini just like a cucumber before I grate it...not sure what it'd taste like if I left the skin on.",

One note though - the recipe make 2 loaves rather than the one that is indicated. I made it 2x and both times substituted dried apples (chopped) for the nuts as my 2 year old likes apples and not nuts. The first batch was otherwise made as directed and was extremely good (I got lots of compliments from others who tasted it). I also made another batch using egg replacer (Ener-G) for my mother-in-law who has a egg allergy. She was absolutely crazy about it and I had 4 other people sample it vs. the real egg and they all agreed that it was very good also - you can tell there is a texture difference though. Overall this recipe is very versatile with a lower oil content than others without sacrificing any of the moistness. The raisins may help here - and btw I had several people who hate raisins compliment the bread.",
