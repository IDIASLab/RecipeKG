They said that if you added mustard, it would act like a binder between the oil and vinegar.  They said you could always use lemon juice, too.  Since then, mustard is always added.  It doesn't take much. I prefer my dressing more 1:1 ratio of oil and vinegar.  Also, if you use garlic powder instead of fresh and leave out the shallot, you can leave the dressing out on the counter, so if you are using olive oil, you don't have to wait for it to \"melt.\"  I always have some made and ready on the counter, and it is wonderful.",
