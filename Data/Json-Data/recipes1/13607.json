It turns out that there aren't very many and I'm not an experienced enough baker to be comfortable just substituting out the alcohol. This recipe looked good and was highly rated. It was easy to make. I did burn it a little--with so little cake I found it hard to figure out when my toothpick came out clean. The flavors combine well and it will definitely make a good sweet treat or trail food (although it is quite sticky) but I am still looking for that non-alcoholic fruit CAKE recipe.",
