I used reduced fat cream cheese reduced fat sour cream reduced fat mayonnaise and homemade ranch dressing mix (I suggest you use SD's dry ranch dressing mix which is also on this site. I use that several times a week and it's totally replaced packaged dry ranch dressing.) I did thin this down with fat free milk so it would \"dip\" a little easier and stretch a little farther as well as technically be less calories per \"dip\". We all liked this a lot. This was a great way to make ranch dip at home with lowfat ingredients that I bought on sale this week. A little really does go a long way and it stretches really fantastically.",

I doubled this recipe and in doing so learned a very important fact: that much dip does NOT fit into a normal blender receptaclel It must be done in two batches. Also I made it the day before to allow the flavors to marry. They did; the dip was a big hit served with crudite chips and crackers; and I am very pleased I tried it! Happy New Year!",
