The best thing to do is mix all the ingredients lightly then balling it up and letting the crust sit in the fridge (to get the butter cold again) and then quickly work the crust for the tart. Doing this the crust worked fine and tasted great.",

Here's my original review from a couple of months ago: I was very happy with these tarts and I only made two minor changes to the recipe: I didn't have unsalted butter so I just didn't add the extra salt and I used maple sugar instead of brown sugar but since the flavour didn't really come through next time I probably just use brown sugar. I should note that I did have to flour up the work surface and the rolling pin pretty well to keep the dough from getting to sticky but otherwise it was great!",
