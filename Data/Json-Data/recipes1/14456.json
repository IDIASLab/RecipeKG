When we came back home, I kept missing it so I called them up and requested it.  They actually gave me the recipe over the phone!  I generally halve the recipe for my husband and I, and bake it in an 8 inch square pan.  Reheats well in the toaster oven.  I served it to my in-laws recently and they loved it. Serve with a little sweetened whipped cream and berries!",

                "reviewBody": "This is an excellent recipe.  I didn't need to modify it at all, but I did based on what I had available.  I substituted walnuts for pecans and added orange-flavored cranberries before layering the bread.  The flavor was excellent and the walnuts helped to tone the richness of the french toast.  The only note I would add is that I would let it set for approximately 10-15 minutes before serving.  The butter, sugar, syrup mixture needs a little time to carmalize and the french toast retains the heat for quite a while after serving.  The 10-15 minutes will also allow the bread to firm up a little and arrive at a nice texture.",

I also used brioche instead of French bread and was delighted with the results!\r\n\r\nThank you (and the bed & breakfast you and your husband stayed at!) for supplying this amazing recipe. It'll be on my repetoire for YEARS to come!",

After having read over 200 reviews of the recipe, I made the following adjustments:   greased bottom and sides of the 9X13 pan with shortening (for easier release of the baked french toast); cut the slices of french bread 1\" thick; added twice the amount of orange zest; used a total of 6 whole eggs (both yolk and egg white) and 1/2 c. + 2 T. 2% milk for the liquid mixture (to better cover all of the bread); baked the dish for 45 minutes; and let the dish set for 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven before serving it.  I did not add the white sugar to the liquid mixture, but I did use an entire cup of light brown sugar for the pecan topping as the recipe called for.  My company loved it and immediately asked for the recipe.  It made 6 large or 8 small servings.",
