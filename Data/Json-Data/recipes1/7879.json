The first thing you need to do is add more mayonaise--three tablespoons just isn't enough to make it creamy.  I also used sweet pickle relish instead of the dill pickles.  The sweet pickle relish mixes better, adding consistency and flavor throughout the salad.  I would suggest adding the ingredients to your own tastes, and not following the suggested amounts.",

I used my food processor to chop all the ingredients and spread the chicken salad on wheat hoagie buns (cut them into 5ths). Every lady at the shower has asked for this recipe and what exact ingredients (BRANDS) I used. I made sure they all knew I only used one large yellow onion and not 6 onions like the recipe called for in the scaled to 50 version. It was the hit of the shower as far as the food selection. EVERY sandwich was eaten! I scaled the recipe for 50 servings and spread generous amounts on each hoagie bun then cut the sandwiches into 5 servings per bun. This is by far the BEST and most easy tasty chicken salad I have ever made or tasted. I highly recommend using this recipe.",

And Angel, 3T of mayo is just perfect for a small chicken breast or two small halves. I didn't change a thing, except I didn't want to deal with a half chicken breast so I used it all (but it was small).I also used red onion for color. Your measurements are perfect! This is a keeper. We loved the subtle taste that the dill pickle and onion provided. For those of us who love savory over sweet meat and poultry dishes, this is a definite keeper.I served on a bed of red leaf lettuce and garnished with thin rings of red onion. YUM! Thanks Angel.",

I am one of those that does not like sweet meat salads (there are a few of us out there) so I was purposely looking for one that does not have sweet relish and here it is! Perfect the way it is! No gloppy mayo salad, just enough to hold it together and the dill pickles are prefect!!! That is what this recipe is and if you are more partial to sweeter salads, look for a recipe that suits your taste instead of bashing something that isn't what you want. This is a wonderful recipe!!!

I used 2 celery stalks 4-5 Tbsp Miracle Whip (to account for the extra chicken) 1/4 cup sweet onion 2 dill pickles 1/4 tsp garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste. I chopped everything really tiny just because I like it that way. It lets you get a little of everything in each bite. I LOVED IT!!! I asked my husband if he liked it and he said \"it's oniony\". As other reviews stated I guess it's a matter of personal taste. It was super quick super easy and super good. We had it with Chicken Ramen Noodles. Nice easy meal almost no clean up. I'll make this with all my leftover chicken.T hanks Angel.",
