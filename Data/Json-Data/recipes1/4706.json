I added an additional can of cream of chicken soup 1/2 cup sour cream in the soup mixture 1/2 tsp of mild curry 4 green onions 1 tsp of garlic. I used cheddar cheese instead of swiss...and steamed broccoli slightly cooked before adding the soup mixture. This is a great casserole even though I changed some things. I covered for the 1st 30 mins...then took the foil off for the last 30mins. Thanks for posting such a great recipe!!",
