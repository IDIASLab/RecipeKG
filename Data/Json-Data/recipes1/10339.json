How cool to be able to make them at home now!  My husband requests these almost weekly.  You wouldn't think something so \"plain\" would be so tasty - but they really are - and so easy, too!  I like to serve them with parmesan-herb roasted potato wedges and a crisp green salad.  You can also use extra lean ground turkey if you want to go the healthier route, instead of the beef.  I saute the onion a little bit first to eliminate \"onion breath\".  You can wrap the burgers in waxed paper if you want, just like they do at the restaurant.  It helps keep all the good stuff in!  Thanks, Carlo - your wife got it just right!",

With the addition of pickles, cheese, and mustard, a great sandwich was made. UPDATE: Since I make this ALL the time, it has to be a five star recipe. I've used beef broth and chicken broth, both are excellent. To prepare the sandwiches, I spoon the meat mixture onto one side of the bun, add some onions, and on the other side I put shredded cheddar, and broil in the oven until the cheese is just melted.
