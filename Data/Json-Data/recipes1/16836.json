Used chicken broth instead of the bouillon/water, and added about a cup of pinot grigio to deglaze after I had browned the chicken.  Added a packet of onion & mushroom soup, and a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  Very tasty -- saving the left over liquid for future use as it is so flavorful.  There's really nothing complicated to the dish -- you can add all sorts of things to suit your tastes.  I bet it would be great with some jalapenos in there to spice it up or try some parsnips in there or rutabaga.",
