This is very similar to Heavenly White Cake which has great reviews. This has a bit more cake flour and sugar and an extra egg white. It produces (3) 9 inch layers where as Heavenly White Cake produces (3) 8 inch layers. As with Heavenly White Cake I used butter vs. shortening and used 1 & 1/2 cups of milk which may account for the additional moistness. I also doubled the vanilla. Be sure to whip your egg whites!!! If you need detailed instructions view the ones for Heavenly White Cake - it'll be a big help. Both are delicious. I filled this cake with seedless raspberry jelly and \"Whipped Cream Frosting\" from this site.",

                "reviewBody": "This is extremely close to my Great Grandmother's recipe. She calls for 1/2 c more sugar 1 tsp less baking powder and 1/2 tsp more almond. I also use whipping cream instead of milk. Follow the directions! Sift cake flour THEN measure 3c. Sift all dry ingredients again. Line the bottom of the pans with parchment do not grease them. Fluff the shortening with half the sugar so it has a frosting like consistency. This will create air bubbles in the fat. Adding cold eggs or milk will deflate the air you worked hard to create! Also be sure to beat your egg whites until soft peaks form by using the other half of the recipe sugar and ONLY egg whites. If you add yolks it will not fluff up right and you will not have enough air. This will take about 10 min. Don't deflate mix as you're adding the dry and wet ingredients. Do this by adding the most amount of dry first to coat with the fat before starting to add the cream. Mix by hand Do not over mix once the baking powder has been activated (mixed with the wet). You should have to spread your cake into the pans not pour. It will be visibly bubbly! Oven temperature is also key - must be a steady 350. Even if you follow directions a faulty oven will spoil it all. Have a suspended thermometer to make sure your oven temp is correct (25deg too hot or cold makes a huge difference). Do not open the oven or it will fall! Send running children outside! Let the cake cool in the parchment lined pans.",
